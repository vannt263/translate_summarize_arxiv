    "the density - matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) , developed by white in 1992 @xcite , is one of the most precise numerical algorithms for the investigation of low - dimensional strongly correlated systems .",
    "originally the dmrg was introduced to compute the ground state and low energy spectrum of a quantum hamiltonian @xmath1 .",
    "meanwhile there are a number of variants using the basic dmrg idea of numerical renormalisation in other physical fields @xcite .",
    "an important progress was made by applying the dmrg to the transfer - matrix of 2d classical systems @xcite , a method known as transfer - matrix dmrg ( tmrg ) .",
    "this even allows to analyse the thermodynamics of 1d quantum systems @xcite by mapping the partition function to a 2d classical model using a trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite .",
    "a highly efficient realisation of a tmrg algorithm , which uses corner - transfer - matrices ( ctms ) , was proposed in @xcite and is called corner - transfer - matrix dmrg ( ctmrg ) .",
    "an upcoming new application field of the dmrg algorithm are 1d stochastic systems .",
    "the dynamics of such models are described by a master equation which has the form of a schrdinger equation with a `` stochastic '' hamiltonian @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the dmrg algorithm can be used to compute the stationary limit of the stochastic process , which corresponds to the ground state of @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast to quantum systems @xmath1 is in general not hermitian since there is genuinely no detailed balance .",
    "carlon @xcite first applied the stochastic dmrg algorithm to various reaction - diffusion models and discussed in detail the influence of non - hermitian operators on the numerics .",
    "an alternative approach to stochastic models using a tmrg algorithm was proposed in @xcite . in complete analogy to quantum systems the dynamics of 1d stochastic models can be mapped to a 2d classical model .",
    "therefore it was quite natural to apply the tmrg to the corresponding `` stochastic '' transfer - matrix . even though this so - called stochastic",
    "tmrg is similar to the quantum case in many respects , some important differences appear .",
    "enss and schollwck @xcite discussed in detail properties of the stochastic transfer - matrix focussing on the choice of the density - matrix .",
    "unfortunately , the stochastic tmrg shows an unsatisfactory convergence caused by inherent numerical problems which are related to the structure of the stochastic transfer - matrix .",
    "the present work proposes a new approach to analyse the dynamics of stochastic problems , a method which we refer to as stochastic light - cone ctmrg ( lctmrg ) .",
    "as suggested by its name , the lctmrg combines ideas of the stochastic tmrg and ctmrg algorithms , adjusted by a causality argument which demands a number of modifications for an adaption of the ctmrg to stochastic problems .",
    "we show that the lctmrg is a considerable improvement of the stochastic tmrg with respect to numerical stability and performance .",
    "stochastic models have gained a large interest in statistical physics .",
    "they are used not only in physical but many interdisciplinary research fields to describe processes far away from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the bandwidth of applications reaches from the description of social behaviour and biological processes to traffic flow ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "typically , stochastic models start from an initial state which evolves in time according to ( local ) probabilistic rules .    in the present work we focus on one - dimensional stochastic problems .",
    "we consider a chain of length @xmath2 , where each site @xmath3 can either be occupied by a particle ( @xmath4 ) or empty ( @xmath5 )",
    ". in stochastic physics one is interested in the dynamic evolution of a probability distribution @xmath6 of states .",
    "@xmath6 can be denoted as a vector @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability of finding the chain in the configuration @xmath9    depending on the type of dynamics , @xmath10 can evolve in continuous or discrete time . assuming continuous dynamics ,",
    "stochastic processes can be described by a master equation @xmath11 @xmath1 is called `` stochastic hamiltonian '' @xcite because has the form of a schrdinger equation in imaginary time .",
    "the matrix elements are given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote the probabilistic rates of the transition @xmath14 .",
    "although the master equation suggests a close analogy to quantum systems , as an important difference the stochastic hamiltonian @xmath1 is in general _ not _ hermitian .",
    "a formal solution of is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the initial probability distribution at @xmath17 .",
    "obviously , the stationary limit @xmath18 is a ( right ) eigenvector of @xmath1 with eigenvalue 0 .",
    "stochastic models can show a rich phase diagram and interesting critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "the simplest situation is an absorbing phase transition @xcite into an empty state @xmath19 . introducing the occupation number operator @xmath20 of site @xmath21 , the average local density of particles @xmath22 ( with arbitrary @xmath21 due to translational invariance ) is an order parameter that distinguishes the phases : all particles can either vanish ( @xmath23 ) and the system falls into the ( absorbing ) state @xmath24 , or a certain number of particles stay `` active '' ( @xmath25 ) . in the critical region @xmath26",
    "evolves according to a power law whereas a non - critical behaviour is characterized by an exponential decay : @xmath27    like quantum systems , stochastic processes show universal behaviour at criticality . the most prominent universality class , which is typical for phase transitions to an absorbing state , is the directed percolation class ( dp ) @xcite .",
    "but in general non - equilibrium phase transitions are by far not so well understood as those in equilibrium physics .",
    "we focus on the calculation of the dynamic evolution of the local density @xmath28 of a stochastic process in the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 and assume that @xmath1 consists of local `` stochastic interactions '' @xmath30 as in the conventional quantum tmrg algorithm @xcite , the stochastic system is first mapped to a 2d statistical model by using a trotter - suzuki decomposition @xcite of .",
    "the resulting classical 2d lattice @xcite is shown in ( a ) which local plaquette interactions are given by @xmath31 thus , the spatial dimension @xmath2 of the stochastic process is expanded by a virtual trotter dimension @xmath32 which corresponds to the time direction and is split into ( discrete ) steps of size @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath33 has to be chosen sufficiently small to obtain a good approximation of @xmath26 .",
    "formally , the trotter decomposition becomes exact for @xmath34 . as we measure the local density @xmath26 at finite time @xmath35 , but in the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 of the stochastic chain , the space dimension of the 2d lattice is infinite , whereas the trotter dimension is finite .",
    "note that in contrast to the quantum tmrg the boundary conditions are fixed in trotter direction and given by the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath16 , cf .",
    "( a ) .    in complete analogy to the quantum case one can apply a tmrg algorithm to the 2d lattice @xcite . using column transfer - matrices , shown here pictorially for the example of ( a ) , @xmath37 the local density @xmath26 for the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 can be calculated by @xmath38 @xmath39 labels the leading right / left eigenvector of @xmath40 , having the eigenvalue 1 @xcite .",
    "the stochastic tmrg algorithm is used to compute @xmath39 and @xmath41 for successively increasing trotter numbers @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately , various computations show numerical problems that limit @xmath43 @xcite , which is far from enough to compete with other methods like monte - carlo simulations ( mcs ) .    here",
    "we propose a different tmrg algorithm based on corner - transfer - matrices ( ctm ) .",
    "such a corner - transfer - matrix dmrg algorithm ( ctmrg ) is known to be numerical more stable and faster than tmrg @xcite .",
    "before we explicitly construct these ctms for the stochastic case , we discuss some physical properties of the 2d lattice relevant for the development of the new algorithm .    due to probability conservation",
    "we have @xmath44 for any state @xmath45 .",
    "thus , @xmath46 trivializes by summing out the `` future '' indices , i.e.@xmath47 the effect of to the 2d lattice is discussed in detail in @xcite . for the computation of @xmath26",
    "it is found that a huge number of plaquette interactions can be omitted , because they `` trivialize '' .",
    "the remaining non - trivial plaquettes form a 2d lattice of _ finite _ dimension which is shown in ( b ) .",
    "the trivialisation process can easily be understood by a causality argument : only a `` light - cone '' of plaquette interactions can influence the site where the local density is measured .",
    "we now construct a ctmrg algorithm which genuinely fits to the triangle structure of the 2d lattice .",
    "as shown in , four cuts are set to separate the lattice into four parts .",
    "the cuts are somewhat native to our model , because they form the boundaries of the `` future '' and `` past light - cone '' of the center point of the triangle .",
    "the four parts @xmath48 \\left(c_d\\right)_{n_s}^{\\bar n_s}= \\begin{minipage}{2.3 cm } \\pandocstartinclude{cd.pstex}\\pandocendinclude{input}{331}{17 } \\end{minipage}&,\\quad & \\left(c_u\\right)_{n_s}^{\\bar n_s}= \\begin{minipage}{2.3 cm } \\pandocstartinclude{cu.pstex}\\pandocendinclude{input}{335}{17 } \\end{minipage}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are interpreted as ctms whereby @xmath49 and @xmath50 label block - spins .",
    "we next show how these ctms can be treated within a ctmrg algorithm analogous to e.g.  @xcite",
    ". however , a number of modifications are necessary to adapt the ctmrg to the light - cone of plaquettes .",
    "hence , we call this ctmrg variant light - cone ctmrg ( lctmrg ) .      in a ctmrg algorithm",
    "the ctms are enlarged sequentially by adding transfer - matrices ( tms ) to each cut .",

    ".    demonstrates graphically how the tms are used to enlarge the ctms , whereby ctms and tms are `` jointed '' by summing out the adjacent indices ( similar to a matrix multiplication ) . due to the exotic geometry of the lattice we have to distinguish between an upper and lower extension step depending on whether @xmath54 or @xmath55 should be enlarged .    in our lctmrg algorithm",
    "both extension steps are implemented alternately . that way all ctms grow step by step with the crossing point of the cuts always situated in the center of the triangle .",
    "after each extension step the ctms have to be renormalized by a density - matrix projection , cf .  .",
    "the local density @xmath56 can be obtained using @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xmath59 it is important to notice that @xmath26 is computed in the center of the triangle - lattice . here",
    ", influences of boundary effects are expected to be smallest . in terms of a dmrg algorithm , the ctms @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath54 act as an `` environment '' of the `` system '' @xmath55 .",
    "the key problem is to find a reasonable density - matrix projection for the renormalization of the ctms after each extension step .",
    "we exemplify the construction of the density - matrix by looking at ( a ) . here",
    ", one block - spin and two spins of @xmath62 and @xmath61 have to be renormalized into one block - spin .",
    "the construction of the optimal density - matrix projection is now discussed in detail .",
    "first , we define four vectors : @xmath63 the block - spin @xmath64 belongs to the environment , @xmath65 and @xmath49 to the system block .",
    "note that these vectors approximate the left and right eigenvector of the leading eigenvalue of diagonal tms @xmath66 which have a different shape compared to the stochastic tms used in the stochastic tmrg @xcite .",
    "as @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) have not to be computed by any expensive diagonalization routine like in tmrg , the lctmrg algorithm is much faster .",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 are used to construct a reduced density - matrix for each of the two cuts .",

    "however , one can easily proof that @xmath75 is trivially given by @xmath76 which follows directly from the trivialization process .",
    "obviously @xmath75 is not very useful for constructing a density - matrix , because @xmath77 reduces to a trivial projector which does not correlate system and environment block .",
    "hence , we omitted @xmath75 and tested the density - matrix @xmath78 } = \\tr_{\\bar n_s } { \\ensuremath{\\big|\\psi_l^x\\big > } } { \\ensuremath{\\big<\\psi_l^x\\big|}}\\ ] ] which led to much better results ( cf .  ) .",

    "a physical explanation for the choice of @xmath83}$ ] can be given in terms of the light - cone picture of .",
    "the trivial vector @xmath84 is a superposition of all feasible states which means that at each cut no further information about the `` future '' is available .",

    "only the physics of the past , the information of which is carried by @xmath86 , correlate system and environment indices .",
    "we briefly discuss some implementation details of the lctmrg algorithm .",
    "the first tmrg step should start with the following configuration    of transfer - matrices .",
    "this corresponds to the time @xmath87 and is the simplest construction of initial ctms and tms . the first extension steps ( cf .  )",
    "are performed without renormalisation until the dimension of the ctms exceeds the number @xmath88 of dmrg states .",

    "if additionally the local hamiltonian @xmath90 is parity invariant , i.e.  @xmath91 , the local transfer - matrix @xmath46 becomes symmetric .",
    "hence , only the ctms @xmath92 and tms @xmath93 have to be stored . @xmath94 and",
    "@xmath95 can be reconstructed by mirroring @xmath96 and @xmath97 .    in order to avoid floating point overflows of the algorithm ,",
    "it is recommended to rescale all ctms and tms @xmath98 where @xmath99 is some norm .",
    "note that these rescaling factors have to be considered in the computation of @xmath26 .",
    "all computations were done on sun workstations ( ultra sparc iii , 900 mhz ) .",
    "compared to the old stochastic tmrg @xcite the lctmrg algorithm is tremendously more efficient .",
    "furthermore , as most parts of the program consist of matrix multiplications of ctms and tms , the lctmrg algorithm can easily be parallized .",
    "the cpu time needed for one trotter step ranges from a few milliseconds for @xmath100 states up to a couple of seconds for @xmath101 states .",
    "the consumption of computer memory is modest as well , e.g.  10 mb for @xmath100 up to 200 mb for @xmath101 .",
    "the numerical studies of the present work focus on reaction - diffusion processes ( rdp ) which are used to model various chemical reactions . we consider a simple rdp with one type of particle @xmath102 which exhibits the following reactions @xmath103 this rdp can be expressed by a stochastic hamiltonian @xmath104 with local interactions @xmath105 @xmath90 is parity invariant and the local transfer - matrix @xmath46 becomes symmetric .",
    "therefore the lctmrg algorithm simplifies , cf ..    as an example , we apply the new lctmrg algorithm to two rdps , the diffusion - annihilation process and the branch - fusion process .",
    "these models have also been chosen by carlon @xcite to demonstrate the efficiency of the stochastic dmrg algorithm .    the diffusion - annihilation process ( dap ) @xmath106 is exactly solvable @xcite . for an unbiased initial probability distribution the dynamic evolution of the local density",
    "is given by @xmath107 where @xmath108 are modified bessel functions .",
    "thus we can use analytical results to check the numerical precision of the tmrg data .",
    "note that the dap is critical for all @xmath109 with an asymptotic behaviour @xmath110 .",
    "the branch - fusion process ( bfp ) @xmath111 is a simple one parameter model which exhibits a non - equilibrium phase transition from an active to an absorbing phase .",
    "the bfp is not exactly solvable , but monte - carlo - simulations and stochastic dmrg computations @xcite are available .",
    "the critical behaviour of the bfp falls into the dp universality class where precise data for the critical exponents have been calculated by series expansions @xcite .",
    "using the stochastic lctmrg for both models can demonstrate , whether the method is capable to produce reliable results for    * critical and non - critical systems * systems at phase transition points .    the next subsections present numerical results for the two processes .",
    "if not stated differently , all computations were performed with @xmath112 .",

    "up to more than @xmath114 trotter steps we obtain highly precise data with a deviation of less than @xmath115 from the exact results .",
    "the inset of ( left ) plots the lctmrg data in a double - logarithmic plot , which shows that @xmath26 falls of algebraically .",
    "the high number of trotter steps @xmath42 is a considerable improvement to the old stochastic tmrg algorithm @xcite by at least _ three _ orders . even though the dap is critical",

    "thus the arguments given in can be confirmed numerically : @xmath116}$ ] is not an adequate density - matrix for the stochastic lctmrg .      in this section",
    "we focus on the critical phase transition of the bfp at @xmath118 @xcite .",

    "@xmath121 the convergence becomes worse .",
    "( right ) plots the logarithmic derivative @xmath122 at the critical point @xmath121 for @xmath101 states , which is very sensitive to numerical errors .",
    "up to more than @xmath123 trotter steps the numerics are extremely precise , and one can verify that @xmath26 switches to an algebraic behaviour .",
    "it is also possible to determine the critical exponent @xmath124 by extrapolating @xmath125 , cf .",
    "inset of ( right ) .",
    "thereby , we were able to compute @xmath124 up to a precision of less than 0.1% : @xmath126    the question arises why the convergence of the lctmrg at @xmath121 is two orders less than in the dap process , yet both models behave critical .",
    "we checked various numerical aspects to determine the origin of the worse convergence .",
    "in the bfp it is conspicuous that the quality of the results at @xmath121 strongly depends of the number of states @xmath88 that are retained within the lctmrg algorithm .",
    "this is demonstrated in ( left ) which plots numerical computations for various @xmath88 at @xmath121 .    however , it is surprising that so many states @xmath88 are needed although there is a very strong fall off of the density - matrix eigenvalues @xmath127 , cf .",
    "( right ) .",
    "as another possibility we check the influence of the size of the trotter steps @xmath33 on the numerics .",
    "the curves of ( left ) belong to various @xmath33 , but are rescaled to @xmath112 for comparison .",
    "even though finer trotter decompositions increase the total number of convergent trotter steps , one can not improve the accuracy of the data with respect to the absolute time @xmath35 .",
    "if on the other hand @xmath33 becomes too large , the trotter decomposition itself gets worse and is then responsible for unsatisfactory numerical data .    to estimate the effect of numerical errors caused by floating point inaccuracies we implemented the diagonalization routine for the density - matrix alternatively by using higher mantissa bits .",
    "this was technically realized by using the gmp library @xcite which allows an arbitrary number of mantissa bits . as shown in ( right ) , only a marginal effect on the numerics is observed .",
    "overall , it remains an open question what exactly is the limiting factor for the worse convergence at the phase transition point @xmath121 in the bfp . to exclude model specific reasons",
    ", we also checked other rdps , e.g.  the contact process .",
    "qualitatively , the same limited convergence near the critical phase transition point is observed .",
    "in the present work we proposed a new variant of the stochastic tmrg by using corner - transfer - matrices which we call stochastic light - cone ctmrg ( lctmrg ) .",
    "the lctmrg algorithm fits genuinely to the specific structure of the triangle classical lattice which evolves from the trotter - suzuki decomposition of the stochastic model .",
    "we tested the new algorithm by comparing lctmrg data to exact results and monte - carlo simulations of two different reaction - diffusion models .",
    "we obtained highly precise numerical results ( @xmath128 ) up to @xmath129 trotter steps , even if the model behaves critical as the diffusion - annihilation process .",
    "compared to the old stochastic tmrg algorithm @xcite with @xmath43 , this is an enormous increase of the number of reachable trotter steps of three orders .",
    "an important observation is that inherent numerical problems of the old stochastic tmrg algorithm do obviously not appear in our new approach . in the vicinity of a critical phase transition point , exemplified by the branch - fusion model",
    ", the convergence gets worse , but is nevertheless sufficient to determine precise results for critical exponents .",
    "since _ within _ critical phases a much better convergence has been observed , it remains an open question what exactly causes the reduced convergence at critical phase _",
    "boundaries _ , which presumably does not originate from purely numerical reasons . therefore our future research is concentrated on further modifications and improvements of the lctmrg algorithm , e.g.  the implementation of a finite size algorithm .",
    "overall the numerical investigations show that the new lctmrg algorithm is a considerable step towards a general and very efficient method for 1d stochastic problems .",
    "compared to the traditional approach using monte - carlo simulations , there are two fundamental advantages of the lctmrg :    * the lctmrg is not a simulation technique .",
    "there is no need of taking random numbers and sample averages .",
    "the lctmrg is a numerical renormalisation group based on the quantum formalism for stochastic models where averages are directly accessible . *",
    "the algorithm describes the _ exact _ thermodynamic limit @xmath29 of the stochastic model .",
    "note that here we even have to deal with a _ finite _",
    "classical 2d system only , due to the simplification from the `` light - cone decoupling '' .",
    "thus , there are in principle no finite - size effects like in mcs or stochastic dmrg",
    ".    even if the number of possible time steps , in particular at phase transition points , can not compete with mcs up to now , we believe that stochastic tmrg algorithms can be an extremely valuable tool for studying 1d stochastic systems .",
    "finally we mention , that  as in the case of the ctmrg @xcite  a generalisation of the lctmrg to more than one dimension is also imaginable .",
