    "a significant fraction of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) exhibit periodic dips in their x - ray intensity .",
    "the dips recur at the orbital period of the system and are believed to be caused by periodic obscuration of a central x - ray source by structure located in the outer regions of an accretion disk ( white & swank 1982 ) .",
    "the depth , duration and spectral properties of the dips vary from source to source and from cycle to cycle ( e.g. parmar & white 1988 ) .",
    "determination of the spectral evolution in dipping allows not only the structure and dynamics of the outer regions of the accretion disk and the properties of the absorbing material , but also the geometry and nature of the emission regions , to be investigated ( see church et al .",
    "1997 , 1998a , b ) . in the lmxb dip sources , the spectral changes during dips",
    "are complex and can not be described by simple absorption of one - component emission but can be described by assuming two emission components : one point - like blackbody from the surface of the neutron star , and the other extended comptonized emission from an accretion disk corona ( adc ) ( church & bauciska - church 1993 , 1995 ) . in some sources , dipping is well explained in terms of a relatively small absorber which covers the point - like emission but does not absorb the extended emission to a large extent . in another group of dip sources , the dip spectra indicate the presence of excesses at @xmath74  kev , i.e. clear evidence that part of the spectrum is not absorbed ( parmar et al .",

    "the dip spectra of these sources have often been fitted by a technique in which the non - dip spectral form is split into two parts each having the form of non - dip emission , but only one of which suffers extra absorption , while the other has a normalization which decreases markedly in dipping , often by a factor of 10 .",
    "this may be called ` absorbed + unabsorbed ' modelling .",
    "explanations for the apparent change in normalization have been based on electron scattering , partial covering by the absorber and fast variations of column density ( parmar et al .",
    "1986 ) ; however , it has been difficult to explain the large changes convincingly .",
    "for example , a large degree of electron scattering is unlikely in the outer accretion disk where the ionization state is low as demonstrated by the observed occurrence of photoelectric absorption in dipping .",
    "an alternative approach based on the two - component model ( above ) for the dip sources has been suggested ( church et al . 1997 ) . in this group of sources ,",
    "the absorber is extended and often of larger angular extent than all emission regions .",
    "thus in dipping , the point - like blackbody region is covered immediately whereas the extended comptonized emission region is progressively covered by the absorber .",
    "this approach can explain the complex behaviour in several sources ( church et al .",

    "since dips are almost certainly due to obscuration by intervening material , a satisfactory model should fit the dip spectra without requiring any of the parameters that characterize the source emission such as the temperature or power - law index to be changed .",

    "thus , there was little change in the low energy cutoff of the spectrum in dipping compared with the non - dip spectrum .",
    "next , the model frequently applied to the dip sources with an unabsorbed component at low energies was tried ( e.g. parmar et al .",

    "however , for the first time ,  offers the ability to test this model more rigorously since the normalization decrease , if real , implies that the pds intensity ( at energies where absorption plays no part ) would have to decrease substantially between non - dip and deep dipping , which it clearly does not . fitting the deep dip model obtained above to the pds deep dip spectrum",
    "has a @xmath23 of 27.4/7 for the data between 20 and 50 kev .",

    "the spectral properties of these have been studied by smale et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and by yoshida ( 1993 ) who proposed that the material responsible for the dipping is temporarily ionized by the bursts . in order to investigate whether this scenario is consistent with the burst spectra presented here , a simple spectral comparison between burst no . 1 and the sum of the non - dip bursts was performed using a spectrum extracted from the peak of each burst in each case .",
    "the first burst was chosen since it appears to be most strongly affected of the bursts that occurred in dips .",
    "no attempt was made to sum data from the different bursts that occurred in dips , due to differing continuum levels . and the difficultly in reliably estimating the continuum level to be subtracted , due to the high variability during dipping intervals .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "7 . in both panels the summed spectrum",
    "is well fitted with an absorbed blackbody .",
    "the left panel also shows the best - fit to burst no .",
    "1 using a blackbody with absorption fixed at @xmath96  atom @xmath5 , a value much less than those we obtained in dip fitting ( see table 2 ) .",
    "as can be seen , such a column density is strongly inconsistent with the burst spectrum , providing too much absorption . in constrast , the right panel shows a fit using a highly ( @xmath97 ) ionized absorber which matches the data well .",
    "this suggests that an ionized absorber is an explanation of the lack of strong absorption for the bursts in dips .",
    "we have observed  in a very broad energy range using . as was found in the  observation of the dipping lmxb xb1916 - 053 ( church et al . 1998b )",
    ", the spectrum of  extends towards the highest energies of the pds .",
    "has allowed rigorous testing , for the first time , of absorbed + unabsorbed modelling , and we have shown that the large change in normalization required in the unabsorbed component is inconsistent with the relatively small upper limit decrease of @xmath79% in the pds intensity above 20  kev , and so this model can not fit the broadband spectral evolution .",
    "however , the non - dip spectrum is well fitted by the two - component model consisting of point - like blackbody emission from the surface or boundary layer at the surface of the neutron star , plus extended comptonized emission from an accretion disk corona .",
    "the dip spectra can be well fitted by the progressive covering model in which the point - source blackbody is covered rapidly and the extended emission is covered progressively as the depth of dipping increases .",
    "this becomes the third dipping source with an unabsorbed part of the spectrum that has been modelled in this way ( with xb1916 - 053 and exo0748 - 676 ; church et al .",
    "1998a , b ) .",
    "the systematic increase in covering fraction is consistent with a large absorber moving across the emission regions .",
    "the extended nature of the non - thermal comptonized component is , of course , strongly indicated by the need for progressive covering of this component to explain the spectral evolution during dips , and this is also true in the other sources explained by progressive covering .",
    "the identification of the extended emission component with emission from the adc is supported , for example , by application of this model to exo0748@xmath95676 , in which it was necessary to add a line at 0.65  kev to the extended emission component , the line most probably originating in the adc ( church et al .",
    "1998a ) . the column density for the blackbody increases rapidly implying a point source , and to much higher values than for the non - thermal emission consistent with the point source being obscured by higher density regions in the absorber , whereas the extended emission measures an average across the absorber .",
    "the break energy of @xmath345  kev is somewhat lower than the value found in xb1916@xmath95053 .",
    "this implies an electron temperature in the comptonizing region of @xmath317  kev .",
    "the fits to the dip spectra clearly show that the covering fraction rises to only @xmath3 67% in deepest dipping in the total mecs band , unlike in the sources xb1916@xmath95053 and exo0748@xmath95676 in which the covering fraction determined in the same way often reaches @xmath3100% in deepest dipping ( church et al .",
    "1997 , 1998a , b ) .",
    "we have investigated whether this difference may be related to dust scattering given the non - dip column density in   of @xmath98 atom @xmath5 compared with @xmath99  in xb1916 - 053 ( church et al .",
    "1998b ) and @xmath100  in exo0748 - 676 church et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .",
    "this high absorption will result in a substantial dust scattering halo around  ( e.g. , predehl & schmitt 1995 ) , unless it is intrinsic to the source .",
    "for the observed the optical extinction , @xmath101 , is expected to be @xmath314  mag .",
    "using the relation for the dust scattering optical depth , @xmath102 , derived by predehl & schmitt of @xmath103 gives @xmath104 at 2  kev , or 0.05 at 5  kev .",
    "the fractional halo intensity , @xmath105 , is given by @xmath106 and is 25% at 2  kev , or 5% at 5  kev .",
    "the intensity of any scattered halo will not reflect short - term changes in the intensity of the central source since such variability is smoothed by differential time delays of up to days ( see e.g. , bode et al .",
    "1985 ) . during the @xmath31  hr duration dipping intervals",
    "the scattering halo will remain visible and its intensity and spectrum will be determined by the mean spectrum of  over the last days , as well as the properties of the dust grains themselves .",
    "however , this assumes that all of the halo is collected requiring extraction of data from a relatively large circular region centred on the source in the imaging instruments compared with the radii actually used ( 4  for mecs ) , so that the amount of halo collected may be substantially less than calculated above .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "4 shows that the depth of dipping is @xmath365% at 2 kev ( for the deep dip spectrum ) , although the maximum depth of dipping in the light curve will be somewhat greater because of the averaging involved in accumulating the deep dip spectrum .",
    "however , if we take 35% as an upper limit to the possible contribution of dust scattering at 2 kev , the contributions at higher energies will be reduced by the expected @xmath107 dependence , and the contribution integrated over the band 210  kev can be estimated as @xmath68 10% .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that dust scattering can explain the fact that the covering fraction does not exceed 67% in this band .",
    "a possible explanation of this is that the absorber is `` blobby '' , such that an appreciable fraction of the absorber consists of lower density regions , which effectively do not cover the emission regions reducing the measured covering fraction _",
    "f_. the measured value of _ f _ will be the product of two terms : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the covering fraction between the envelope of the source and the extended emission region , and @xmath110 is the partial covering fraction in the overlapping , blobby absorber .",
    "alternatively , the total angular extent of the absorber could be less than that of the extended emission region .",
    "however , if the preliminary result that the depth of dipping at the lowest energies reaches 100% is correct , given the poor statistics of this result , then the absorber has to be larger than the source .",
    "further work is needed to clarify this point .",
    "the fits to the cutoff power - law and blackbody model indicate that the blackbody emission has a luminosity of @xmath111  , for an assumed distance of 10  kpc . however , the blackbody is weak and the uncertainties in @xmath70 may be larger than shown in table 1 .",
    "the blackbody comprises 14% of the 210  kev flux and the blackbody radius @xmath112 is 0.45 km suggesting that this emission originates in a small boundary layer on the neutron star where the accretion disk impacts .",
    "rutledge et al . ( 1999 ) however , have shown that a simple blackbody model may underestimate the emitting area .",
    "the total 110 kev luminosity is @xmath113 .",
    "these values may be compared with recent results from  for xb1916@xmath95053 in which the blackbody luminosity was @xmath114 , the blackbody 20% of the 110  kev flux , the blackbody radius 0.76 km and the total 110 kev luminosity @xmath115 ( church et al .",
    "it can be seen that the luminosities are scaled down in  by about a factor of 2 compared with xb1916@xmath95053 , with an equivalent change in blackbody radius .",
    "the diameter of the extended emission component @xmath116 can be estimated from the dip ingress and egress timescales @xmath117250500  s. assuming that the absorber is more extended than the source region , @xmath116 is given by @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the transition time , r@xmath120 is the radius of the accretion disk and p is the orbital period . for @xmath119",
    "equal to 250500  s , @xmath116 is 48@xmath121 cm , assuming a disk radius of @xmath122  cm .",
    "the bursts occurring in dips provide burst and absorber diagnostics that are not normally available .",
    "previously , 2 bursts in dips have been observed in the _ ginga _ observations of xb1916@xmath95053 ( smale et al .",
    "1992 ; yoshida 1993 ) .",
    "the bursts were not heavily absorbed , which smale et al . and yoshida attribute to the almost instantaneous ionization of the material responsible for the dipping .",
    "this material then returned to its equilibrium state on the same time scale as the burst decay .",
    "smale et al . ( 1992 ) demonstrate that the burst fluence is sufficient to cause significant photoionization at the outer radius of the disk of @xmath123  cm in the case of xb1916@xmath95053 . in the calculated radius of the accretion disk @xmath124",
    "is @xmath125 cm .",
    "a value of the ionization parameter , @xmath126 is required for absorption to be markedly reduced compared with a neutral absorber , where r is the distance of the obscuring material from the central x - ray source and n its density . if the absorbing region has a thickness along the line of sight of @xmath127 , then @xmath128 where  is the column density due to the absorber , not including interstellar absorption .",
    "the value of @xmath129 is difficult to assess , but values of 0.1 have been suggested ( e.g. mason et al .",
    ". however , in the present case , dipping lasts 40% of the orbital cycle implying a very extended absorber , and it is possible that @xmath129 could be as much as 0.3 . the mean burst luminosity close to the peaks of the bursts is @xmath130  .",
    "spectral fitting gives values for  as an average across the absorbing region of @xmath131 atom @xmath5 after subtraction of the interstellar contribution ( see table 2 ) .",
    "thus the mean value of @xmath132 , equivalent to the mean column density for the absorber , is @xmath3500 for @xmath129 = 0.1 , and 1500 for @xmath129 = 0.3 .",
    "it thus appears likely , given the large uncertainties in this calculation , in l , @xmath124 and @xmath129 , that the absorber is substantially ionized during bursts so that bursts in dips will not show a strong increase in absorption .    in this case , the reduction of integrated count of @xmath330% of the burst in the dip ( compared with non - dip bursts ) will be due to electron scattering .",
    "for the first burst which coincides with a dip , the intensity is 9 count s@xmath19 compared with a height of 17 count s@xmath19 for the non - dip bursts .",
    "this reduction requires an electron column density @xmath133 of @xmath134 electron @xmath10 .",
    "this value can be compared with values of the column density for the blackbody in dipping , i.e. the column density applicable to the point - source neutron star , which should provide the electron column density applicable to bursts on the neutron star .",
    "however out of bursts , using the maximum @xmath63 of the extended emission component as the average of the absorber ( @xmath135 atom @xmath5 ; table 2 ) , the average @xmath136 of the absorber is @xmath325 showing that hydrogen is ionized . the reduction in intensity that this would cause due to",
    "electron scattering is @xmath315% , which would be difficult to detect as a vertical shift in pds data ( between non - dip and deep dip ) but is consistent with our upper limit of @xmath79% between 20 and 50 kev .",
    "the consequence of this is that during a burst , the other elements may become fully ionized , but the electron density @xmath137 would increase less than 20% assuming solar abundances .",
    "the burst referred to occupied the second half of the dip containing it , so the appropriate column density will be less than the maximum blackbody value , and we estimate @xmath138 atom @xmath5 may be appropriate .",
    "thus the extra @xmath133 may be @xmath139 electrons @xmath5 .",
    "this compares well with the value required to reduce the burst intensity as observed .",
    "the  satellite is a joint italian - dutch programme .",
    "we thank the staff of the  science data center for help with these observations .",
    "m. bauciska - church and m.j .",
