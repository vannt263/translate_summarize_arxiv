    "the copernican principle @xcite , defined for the present paper as the principle according to which the observer should not happen to be located in any special location in the universe , is generally _ applied _ in one of three ways in twentieth century cosmology :    ( )    by assuming the cosmological principle , in which spatial sections of the universe at constant cosmological time are close to homogeneous and isotropic when averaged on `` large enough '' length scales ;    by assuming the perfect cosmological principle , in which all of space - time is close to homogeneous and isotropic , on average ; or    by assuming that the universe is very chaotic , very far from homogeneity , but that by the weak anthropic principle , we happen to live in a tiny bubble which is inflated to a locally close to flat friedmann - lematre model ;    or it is _ rejected _    ( )    by taking the `` observational '' point of view that the observer lives at the centre of a close to isotropic but radially very inhomogeneous three - dimensional space - time cone with a spherical ( @xmath0 ) boundary defined by the age of the local patch of the universe , so that no space outside of this sphere exists as far as science is concerned , and which happens to coincide with what one expects in case ( i ) above .",
    "case ( i ) underlies what is generally accepted as the standard hot big bang model , which can be more formally referred to as the almost friedmann - lematre model ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this model may or may not have zero curvature , and it may or may not have trivial topology .",
    "numerous observations now knit together to provide a very solid foundation for the almost friedmann - lematre model , within the spatial , temporal and density limits of its validity .",
    "case ( ii ) , that of a steady state or of a quasi - steady - state model ( @xcite ) , is only defined in its general outline , and would require many more close links with recent observations in order to have predictive power .",
    "for example , the case ( i ) interpretation of quasars redshifts as primarily due to expansion of the universe , when applied to observations , implies that quasars and lyman break galaxies at high redshift trace large scale structure at @xmath1 ( comoving ) and that they function as a standard ruler which implies a low matter density @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this would be very difficult to explain if quasar ( and lyman break galaxy ) redshifts were non - cosmological .    case ( iii ) corresponds to the presently very popular chaotic inflation scenarios . whether or not the weak anthropic principle is consistent with the copernican principle is out of the scope of this paper .    case ( iii )",
    "is generally considered an extrapolation ( towards short cosmological times and large spatial distances ) of the almost friedmann - lematre ( fl ) model .",
    "case ( ii ) could also conceivably be defined as an extension of the fl model .",
    "the anti - copernican case ( iv ) is essentially identical to case ( i ) as far as observational analysis is concerned  as long as the topology of the universe remains unmeasured . however , theoretical calculation is somewhat difficult if case ( i ) is not resorted to .",
    "if the topology of space were measured by observation ( @xcite , and see below ) , then the size of the universe would be finite and less than the horizon diameter in at least one direction , i.e. finite",
    ". models of case ( ii ) would then require serious revision and would no longer satisfy the perfect cosmological principle , and case ( iii ) models would presumably require individual `` universes '' to be born as separate space - times and might have difficulty surviving occam s razor .",
    "case ( iv ) would also be partly or totally avoidable : only the _ apparent _ space would be a sphere centred on the observer .",
    "at least some parts of the `` edge of the universe '' of the case ( iv ) interpretation would no longer be edges .",
    "on the other hand , whether or not case ( i ) would remain valid if the universe is found to be multiply connected would depend on the resolution of the ambiguity in the meanings of the words `` homogeneous '' and `` isotropic '' .",
    "the solution of the einstein - hilbert equations is only found as a local solution , so only _ local _ homogeneity and isotropy are required . in general , although friedmann - lematre models satisfy _ local _ homogeneity and isotropy , they need not satisfy _ global _ homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "observational support for local homogeneity and isotropy does not imply global homogeneity and isotropy .    in this paper , the relevance of different interpretations of these two words in the context of the global geometry of space ( curvature and topology ) is explained and illustrated by simple toy models in two dimensions . by attempting to measure the more subtle elements of inhomogeneity and anisotropy which would reveal the global shape of the universe , some of the ambiguity in deciding how to apply",
    "the copernican principle to observational cosmology could be avoidable : empirical results sometimes help resolve theoretical dilemmas",
    ".    proper distance ( @xcite , eq .",
    "14.2.21 ) in comoving units is used throughout this paper unless otherwise stated .",
    "the hubble constant is parametrised here as @xmath3 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath5 values of the density parameter , @xmath6 , the dimensionless cosmological constant , @xmath7 , the dimensionless curvature , @xmath8 , and the curvature radius @xmath9 are indicated where used .",
    "when justifying the assumptions of ( i ) homogeneity and ( ii ) isotropy , these are generally interpreted to mean that    ( )    the comoving spatial density of astrophysical objects is approximately constant , and    the solid angular distribution of distant objects ( or microwave background fluctuations ) is approximately constant , after correction for the very anisotropic biases due to living in a dusty disk galaxy and due to our peculiar velocity with respect to the comoving reference frame ,    respectively .",
    "both are reasonably consistent with numerous observations , and the latter has been further reinforced recently by the only cosmological class of objects known to be isotropic _ in spite _ of galactic absorption and our peculiar velocity : the gamma ray bursts .",
    "these may in fact reveal the births of black holes , i.e. of regions of extreme curvature ( inhomogeneity ) on very small scales , that are briefly visible before being engulfed by event horizons @xcite .",
    "these two properties ( a ) , ( b ) are generally referred to as `` local homogeneity and isotropy '' .",
    "solutions to the einstein - hilbert equations are normally only found as local solutions of differential equations , and so only local assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy have any effect on friedmann - lematre models .",
    "one might also refer to these as first order homogeneity and isotropy , since only one - point statistics of density are considered .      for the earliest known article on cosmic topology , see @xcite .",
    "a recent review is that of @xcite .",
    "the multiply connected models which have been compared with observations are all fl models , i.e. they are _ locally homogeneous and isotropic_.    a simple way to illustrate multiply connected 3-manifolds which may correspond to the comoving 3-space we live in is to start with the 3-torus , @xmath10 .",
    "this can be thought of    ( )    _ physically _ , as a cube of which opposite faces are identified so that space is continuous , with no boundaries , but finite ,    _ observationally _ , as a tiling of euclidean space @xmath11 by multiple copies of the single _ physical _ `` cube '' , or    as the analogy one dimension higher of a 2-torus embedded in @xmath11 but endowed with an intrinsically flat metric , i.e. a metric different to the normal metric of @xmath11 .    for a demonstration of basic properties of locally homogeneous and isotropic manifolds ,",
    "it is useful to subtract one dimension , i.e. to consider 2-manifolds .",
    "this is the approach adopted here for pedagogical purposes . for the physical universe ,",
    "the results extrapolate to the three - dimensional case .",
    "the cube ( i ) is referred to as a _",
    "fundamental domain _ , and the space ( ii ) is referred to as the _ universal covering space _ or in a new coinage , _",
    "apparent space_. both are equivalent ways of thinking about the same manifold .",
    "the former is useful for conventional physical reasoning , according to which any particle or object only exists at one point in a space , but difficult to use for interpreting observations .",
    "the latter is useful for observational analyses , but surprising and sometimes confusing for physical reasoning , since objects `` exist '' many times in it .    in two dimensions ,",
    "the corresponding space is the flat 2-torus @xmath12 , of which the fundamental domain is a square ( in general a parallelogram , but a square is used for the present paper ) , and the universal covering space is @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ f - ptstor ] shows what such a universe would look like . for reference , the reader should remember that the horizon size for likely values of the curvature parameters @xmath14 is @xmath15 , and that objects like quasars or `` lyman break galaxies '' are seen up to typical redshifts of @xmath16 , which correspond to roughly half this distance .",
    "clusters of galaxies and galaxies are mostly only seen to a few @xmath17 .",
    "present constraints on the size of the universe ( defined here as the injectivity diameter @xmath18 , which is the length of the shortest spatial geodesic linking an object to an image of itself ) are @xmath19 , whether the universe is hyperbolic , flat or spherical .",
    "so , in order to see multiple images of a single object , catalogues of objects which are seen to typically a few tenths of @xmath20 would be required .",
    "this implies that effects of aging of the objects , or of viewing angles , or of movement relative to the comoving reference frame , would make multiple images of a single object appear quite different , so that proving the identity of two images would be difficult .",
    "so , the identity between multiple copies of symbols in fig .",
    "[ f - ptstor ] would not be obvious in any category of presently known objects .",
    "the model is _ locally homogeneous and isotropic _ : any study in a small region around a point is independent of the orientation of the axes of a chosen coordinate system and of the origin of that system .    _",
    "the model of fig .",
    "[ f - ptstor ] is globally homogeneous , but globally anisotropic .",
    "_    the anisotropy is shown by fig .",
    "[ f - septor ] , which shows vectors separating all pairs of images in the simulated universe .",
    "separations between multiple images of single objects correspond to multiples of the generators [ the vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 and clearly cause clustering around these points .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , a one - dimensional pair separation histogram @xmath23 should show sharp spikes corresponding to these cluster points .",
    "( if no offsets were added between multiple images , then the spikes would be dirac @xmath24 functions . )    the pairs of images contributing to these spikes can be referred to as _ generator pairs _ or as _ type ii pairs _ ( @xcite ) , which induce spikes in flat multiply connected spaces , but not in curved multiply connected spaces @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath25 axes are chosen at a different angle , then the diagram would be rotated : the pattern of spikes is not invariant ( i.e. varies ) under rotation .",
    "this proves global anisotropy .",
    "however , the diagram would be statistically identical under a shift ( without rotation ) of the origin : the space is homogeneous .",
    "many 3-manifolds are globally inhomogeneous , but the effect is observationally quite subtle .    the effect is illustrated here for the klein bottle .",
    "this is like @xmath12 , except that a twist is applied before identification of one pair of edges ( here , the `` vertical '' edges ) .",
    "the distribution of images is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - ptskle ] . again ,",
    "this model is _ locally homogeneous and isotropic_.    fig .",
    "[ f - sepkle ] shows that , as for the @xmath12 model , the klein bottle is _ globally anisotropic _ : rotation of the coordinate axes would modify the pattern of crytallographic spikes .    in order to show global inhomogeneity using `` generator pairs '' ,    ( )    knowledge of which pairs of images are due to multiple images of single objects",
    "is required , and    this knowledge is required _ despite the fact that the crystallographic spikes corresponding to `` inhomogeneous generator pairs '' are smeared out making them very difficult to detect .",
    "_    both ( i ) and ( ii ) are , of course , easy for a simulated universe : in the observed universe they are difficult .",
    "comparison of figs  [ f - septor ] and [ f - sepkle ] shows that some crystallographic spikes seem to disappear due to the twist in identifying the vertical edges of the fundamental domain .",
    "figures  [ f - sepklea ] and [ f - sepkleb ] show where these spikes have `` disappeared '' to , using property ( i ) .",
    "different choices of the @xmath26 origin ( see figure captions ) yield different patterns .",
    "together , the two figures show how the spikes have been smeared out .",
    "hence , the klein bottle is _ globally inhomogeneous_.    one way to apply this technique observationally would be    ( )    to use properties of galaxies or quasars which uniquely label and identify individual objects , despite the large fractions of the age of the universe over which the objects age .",
    "this seems difficult given present observational limitations and known techniques , but not impossible .",
    "an alternative method would be    ( )    firstly to detect the crystallographic spikes of generator pairs which _ do _ appear , and which would imply a fundamental domain of size @xmath27 in the horizontal direction , and secondly to hypothesise that the real fundamental domain is just half this length .",
    "this would make predictions of which pairs of objects should correspond to those seen separately in figs  [ f - sepklea ] and [ f - sepkleb ] . if the predicted multiply imaged pairs really were identical , then proving this by observation would be much easier than the `` needle in a haystack '' requirement of finding the corresponding pairs blindly as in the previous suggestion ( a ) .",
    "figs  [ f - sepklea ] and [ f - sepkleb ] illustrate one way in which the copernican principle could be applied directly .",
    "one would not expect the observer to be at any special value of @xmath28 : the value @xmath29 for the toy model shown here would be surprising",
    ".      inspection of fig .",
    "[ f - ptstor ] and a little reflection show that generator pairs are not the only pairs of images which occur repeatedly in a separation vector plot ( or separation distance histogram ) .",
    "close pairs of images of _",
    "non_-identical objects within a single fundamental domain also define separation vectors which are repeated in the apparent space , though in a different way to generator pairs .",
    "these are _ local pairs _ or _",
    "type i _ pairs ( @xcite ; section 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "since there are nine copies of the fundamental domain shown in fig .",
    "[ f - ptstor ] , there are nine local pairs clustered around each of the @xmath31 separation vectors of modulus smaller than @xmath32 .",
    "this is visible as a `` graininess '' in figs  [ f - septor ] and [ f - sepkle ] .    in a flat space , the same effect also occurs for pairs across many copies of the fundamental domain , but in general does not occur in curved spaces .",
    "thus the term `` local '' : it is most useful just to consider relatively close pairs of images",
    ".    @xcite noticed the effect of the local pairs in pair separation histograms , and @xcite showed how to collect these together and detect multiple connectedness .",
    "if these led to detection of multiple connectedness for a model known ( mathematically ) to be inhomogeneous , then this would enable ( a ) above to be applied : the generator pairs could be used to observationally illustrate inhomogeneity .",
    "however , local pairs in themselves would not show inhomogeneity : they are local .",
    "similarly , local @xmath30-tuplets @xcite would not directly show inhomogeneity .",
    "however , since non - orientable manifolds are inhomogeneous , the discovery of significant numbers of matching @xmath30-tuplets , where some of these required orientation reversals , would imply inhomogeneity .    for more details of global homogeneity and isotropy questions of 2-manifolds , and more particularly of 3-manifolds , see @xcite .",
    "the copernican principle , when used to motivate _",
    "local _ homogeneity and isotropy of the universe , does not necessarily imply _ global _ homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "if the topology of the universe is observable , then this may reveal          most techniques for measuring cosmic topology should easily lead to direct geometrical illustrations of global anisotropy if multiple connectedness is detected ( unless the 3-manifold we live is globally isotropic : the projective space , @xmath33 , which can be thought of by identifying all opposite points of the hypersphere @xmath34 , is globally both isotropic and homogeneous , even though multiply connected ) .",
    "by contrast , global inhomogeneity in a flat multiply connected manifold would be difficult to detect directly .",
    "however , prior knowledge of multiple connectedness would help in obtaining direct illustrations of global inhomogeneity .",
    "present observations imply that the observable universe is close to flat @xcite and that multiply connected flat models of size @xmath35 are consistent with present large angle microwave background data @xcite .",
    "the observational approach to global geometry might just possibly provide an empirical solution to an otherwise philosophical question , by showing whether not both local _ and _ global homogeneity and/or isotropy are valid assumptions ..                gomero g.  i. , teixeira a.  f.  f. , rebouas m.  j. , bernui a. , spikes in cosmic crystallography , , 1999 .",
