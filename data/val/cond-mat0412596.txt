    "according to the scaling theory of localization developed by abrahams et al  @xcite in low dimensional systems ( one and two dimensions ) , any degree of disorder will prevent the appearance of a metallic phase .",
    "moreover , former experiments done with two - dimensional electron systems fabricated on semiconductor surfaces showed a logarithmic increase of resistivity while lowering the temperature  @xcite . this behavior lends support to the scaling theory of localization , since this happens in case of a weak electron - electron interaction .",
    "these results were in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite that _ weak _ electron - electron interaction increases localization .",
    "the above experiments were done with samples of high density of electrons , i.e. systems for which the associated wigner radius @xmath1 which is the ratio between the coulomb energy to fermi energy .",
    "however , such a scaling theory does not take into account the electron - electron interaction which was lately believed to be responsible for a metal - insulator transition , observed in several experiments performed at zero magnetic field described below . in the metallic phase , one observes a strong temperature dependence ( a steep @xmath2 caused by the delocalizing effects produced by the interaction between the particles",
    ".    as the density is reduced such that @xmath3 the interaction becomes dominant , for that regime finkelstein  @xcite and castellani et al .",
    "@xcite predicted that for sufficient strong interactions , a 2d system should present a conducting phase as the temperature is lowered .",
    "since recently was possible the fabrication of 2d samples of high quality with very small amount of randomness , measurements were done at very low particles densities . in this way the strongly interacting regime ( @xmath4 ) has become experimentally accessible .",
    "for instance for @xmath5 experiments done on low - disordered @xmath6 silicon samples demonstrated that with increasing electron density one can cross from the insulating regime where the resistance _ diverges _ with decreasing temperature , to a regime where the resistance _ decreases _ strongly with decreasing temperature , clearly showing metallic behavior  @xcite .",
    "in addition to that , in an extensive numerical analysis of the two - dimensional anderson model with dimerised disorder , we have reported the existence of several dynamical regimes  @xcite .",
    "as far as we are concerned there is no a theoretical explanation that describes adequately the metal - insulator transition in two - dimensional systems , as well as the dramatic increase of the spin susceptibility in its vicinity .",
    "comprehensive studies of the state of the art of this intriguing problem are presented by abrahams et al .",
    "@xcite and kravchenko and sarachik  @xcite .    in one - dimensional systems with random disorder of any intensity",
    ", all states are exponentially localized as shown in the pioneering work by anderson  @xcite in dealing with diagonal disorder , i.e. , a model where the on - site energies are randomly distributed . _ _  _ _ on the other hand , when some correlation is included in the model , and without considering interaction between particles , this picture is substantially modified , given place to the appearance of extended states and , consequently , carriers are able to propagate through the system .",
    "several structures with correlated disorder show vanishing of localization , when one considers nearest neighbors hopping . among them",
    "one can quote the random - dimer model that can explain the high conductivity of polymers  @xcite .",
    "another example that show correlated disorder , responsible for particle diffusion in @xmath7 is provided by the structures where the on - site energies follow the fibonacci and thue - morse sequences  @xcite .",
    "one should mention also the harper model of a quasicrystal which presents a mobility edge when the strength of the potential equals the half - bandwidth . starting with a well localized particle in the lattice ,",
    "as long as the harper potential is less than half - bandwidth , we encounter ballistic propagation   @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to analyze the role the electron - electron interaction plays on propagation in some 1d nonperiodic structures .",

    "ii the model assumed for the interaction between two particles in a band , namely the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the two electrons are assumed in the singlet state in order to detect the effect of the hubbard term , since it acts on opposite spins .",
    "we show the density of states for different strengths of the interaction .",
    "the dynamics tools introduced in order to characterize the dynamical behavior are presented in sec .",

    "v we present the results concerning to a 1d crystal with impurities . in sec .",
    "vi we present the conclusion to which we arrived in this work .",
    "with the aim to study the influence of the coulomb interaction between carriers in a @xmath7 lattice , we treat the electron - electron interaction along the hubbard  model @xcite in a crystalline system with impurities .",
    "as the experiments show , the electron - electron interaction should modify the behavior of the carriers as obtained in a one particle non - interacting scheme . in our work",
    "we introduce two interacting particles in an otherwise empty band .",
    "the study of such a problem have deserved a number of interesting works due to the relevant question of what is the role of the interaction between electrons on propagating properties in low dimensional disordered systems  @xcite .",
    "we assume that by solving the present problem one can get a better understanding of the role the interaction plays in real systems .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional lattice of @xmath8 sites with lattice parameter @xmath9 , for which the hubbard hamiltonian is :    @xmath10    were @xmath11 , @xmath12 being the on - site energy , @xmath13 is the intensity of a dc electric field , @xmath14(@xmath15 ) is the fermi creation ( destruction ) operator for an electron of spin @xmath16 at site @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the hopping term and @xmath19(@xmath20 ) is the number operator for spin up ( spin down ) at site @xmath17 . as it was said above , in order to analyze the role the @xmath21 term plays on the dynamics , we treat the case of electrons with opposite spins , the singlet .      to obtain the energy spectrum for the singlet in an impurity - free 1d lattice , we solve the stationary schrdinger equation in the wannier representation where we expand the eigenfunction in terms of the kets @xmath22 that represent the state with one electron of spin @xmath16 at site @xmath23 and the other with spin @xmath24 at site @xmath25 :    @xmath26    in the wannier representation we obtain the following set of equations corresponding to energy @xmath27 :    @xmath28    in this equation the first index refers to a particle with spin @xmath29 and the second for spin @xmath30 .",
    "the wannier amplitudes @xmath31do not depend on time . for simplicity",
    "we omit the label @xmath27 in the wannier amplitudes .    for the crystalline case and without the presence of an electric field , all @xmath32",
    "can be taken as zero .",
    "introducing the center of mass and relative coordinates in units of the lattice parameter :    @xmath33    and following hubbard we expand the wannier amplitudes :    @xmath34    to obtain the following equation for the @xmath35    @xmath36    which in turn becomes :    @xmath37    for every @xmath38 we obtain @xmath39 roots of this equation inside the infinities of the right hand side for which @xmath40 . at the same time , and provided @xmath21 is large enough , there appears an extra root outside the band . in this case , by varying @xmath38 we get an excited second band . by looking at the eigenvalue equation  ( [ vg ] )",
    "we note its close resemblance with the corresponding schrdinger equation for _ one _ particle in a tight - binding @xmath6 hamiltonian , except for the @xmath21 hubbard term  @xcite . the obtained density of states for the crystalline case for @xmath41 shown in fig .",
    "[ dos].a , present two bands .",
    "the lower band is very similar to the case of one electron in @xmath6 for the reasons stated above and , the excited band has the typical structure of tight - binding @xmath7 bands . moreover , by looking at the equation  ( [ e1 ] ) one notes that @xmath42 is a root of it , which happens for @xmath43 this way if @xmath21 is less than @xmath44 we obtain resonant states inside the band , instead of an excited band separated from the @xmath6 band for a @xmath45 gap , that appears when @xmath21 is greater than @xmath44 , since the bottom of the excited band occurs at @xmath42 .",
    "see fig .",
    "we conclude that the inclusion of the electron - electron interaction in a crystalline structure in @xmath7 have produced a band with a structure similar to a @xmath6 band for _ one _ electron , plus an extra band provided @xmath21 is great enough .",
    "we follow the time evolution of wave packets in a @xmath7 lattice , by assuming the following expansion for the wave function in the wannier representation    @xmath46    where the wannier amplitudes now depend on time .",
    "the time evolution of the wave function    @xmath47    becomes in the wannier representation :    @xmath48    we assume the initial condition with an electron around site @xmath49 with spin @xmath50 and the other around site @xmath51 with spin @xmath30 . in order to do this",
    ", we shall consider the initial condition described by gaussian packets of different standard deviations centered at sites @xmath49 and @xmath51 :    @xmath52    where    @xmath53   \\label{n}\\ ] ]    @xmath54   \\label{m}\\ ] ]    and @xmath55 is a normalization constant .",
    "as said before , all @xmath56 can be taken as zero for the crystalline case without an electric field .",
    "we shall consider gaussians with standard deviations @xmath57 .",
    "the case @xmath58 corresponds to a particle localized in a single site . in the crystalline case where all @xmath59 are the same and not taking into account the hubbard electron - electron interaction",
    ", both particles should propagate ballistically in the regular lattice  @xcite .",
    "but now , in the presence of the on - site interaction @xmath21 , a different behavior should take place . to follow the evolution of the particles injected around sites @xmath49 and @xmath51 with spins up and down respectively ,",
    "we perform the following .",
    "we define the mean - square displacement of each electron as indicated below .",
    "@xmath60    and    @xmath61    at the same time we can follow the centroid of the wave packet associated with the movement of each electron as follows :    @xmath62    and    @xmath63    which will give us the amount of the displacement from the initial positions for both electrons .    at the same time , by taking the absolute value of the difference between the respective centroid positions , we can determine the time evolution of the mean distance of the two electrons , or the size of the propagating pair : @xmath64 .",
    "in what follows we shall define the energies in units of the hopping parameter @xmath18 , and the time in dimensionless units @xmath65 .",
    "in order to study the combined effect that the interaction and the extension of the initial wave packet have on the propagating properties , we shall analyze the behavior of the msd s as function of time .",
    "we consider the case in which both particles are injected at @xmath66 in the same position in the lattice . by taking four different initial waves associated with @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70",
    "we note ballistic propagation in all cases , i.e. , @xmath71 . in fig .",
    "[ coeffs ] we have plotted the ballistic coefficient d as function of the interacting hubbard term u.    we treat first the case of non - interacting electrons , i.e. , @xmath72 . we note that the msd s values decrease when the extension of the initial packets increase .",
    "the broader the packet the more inertia it has , it becomes more `` massive '' .",
    "we consider now the interacting case .",
    "first , we concentrate on the @xmath67 case and vary the strength of the hubbard potential .",
    "the u term acts as an on - site energy so that by increasing it , we introduce a barrier that inhibits hopping , the more so , the bigger u is .",
    "we still have propagation but with smaller msd s values as we increase u. the ballistic coefficient @xmath73 is a monotonically decreasing function of u.    an interesting situation occurs when the initial wave packet has an extension , i.e. , @xmath74 .",
    "at this point we should state that the hopping parameter was assumed to be negative . by looking at the dynamical equation ( 10 )",
    "we realize that what is relevant in analyzing propagation is the difference u - v , which can be considered like an effective interaction .",
    "this way , when both magnitudes have the same sign the interaction is reduced , while when they have different sign the effective interaction is increased .",
    "consider first the case @xmath75 .",
    "we obtain in all cases studied ( @xmath57 = @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) the d coefficient increases rapidly with u until reaching a plateau while @xmath76 , i.e. , the more extended the initial wave packet , the more massive it is .",
    "this also happens for the non interacting case @xmath77 , as shown above .",
    "now for @xmath78 a different behavior is observed , where in this case the effective interaction is reduced .",
    "first we take @xmath79 and see that for @xmath80 _ smaller _ values than for @xmath77 are obtained , while for u= -2 we get even smaller values than for @xmath80 . from then on the msd s increase monotonically with @xmath81 , such that from @xmath82 on , the values are greater than the corresponding to @xmath77 .",
    "the minimum of the coefficient d occurs for @xmath83 .",
    "taking a more extended initial wave packet , @xmath84 , the same trend is observed , but now the minimum is at @xmath85 .",
    "already for @xmath86 the msd is larger than for @xmath77 , and from then on they increase monotonically with @xmath87 , as it happens for @xmath88 . as for @xmath89",
    "it shows the same behavior with the minimum closer to u = 0 .",
    "we will explain now the initial decreasing trend for small @xmath90 , when the initial packet has extension different from zero and hopping and interaction parameters have same sign .",
    "we have two competing effects to consider , on one side the extension of the packet implies more inertia ( smaller msd values ) as said above , on the other hand , the presence of the u repulsive term acts on the different components of the wave trying to push the packet further away . for small @xmath87 ,",
    "the first effect overcome so one gets smaller msd values but , increasing @xmath90 , the repulsion dominates so greater values are obtained .",
    "finally , we note a cross over region that happens for @xmath91 , where for the three cases considered : @xmath88 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the corresponding msd values are greater than the ones for @xmath67 , for @xmath92 .    ) and extended ( @xmath79).,width=302 ]",
    "we shall consider injected particles at time zero around sites @xmath49 and @xmath51 , where these sites as well as their nearest neighbors are taken as impurity levels in an otherwise regular lattice . in fig .",
    "[ initial ] , we show the initial wave packets for the configurations @xmath67 and @xmath68 . we illustrate the cases in which the packets are centered at positions @xmath93 , and the impurity levels at @xmath94 , see fig .  [ initial ] . note that for the case @xmath88 the initial wave packets overlap due to the vicinity of the sites @xmath49 and @xmath51 .",
    "obviously for @xmath67 no overlap is obtained .",
    "first we assumed the impurity energy levels at @xmath94 and varied @xmath57 as well as the interacting factor u. we shall discuss the results for the initially well localized wave packets ( @xmath67 ) and moderate interaction , @xmath95 , see fig .",
    "[ e-2u4s0 ] .",
    "the centroids clearly start to depart from each other as soon as the up and down packets overlap due to the interaction .",
    "the msd shows a superballistic behavior : @xmath96 with a time exponent @xmath97 .",
    "one notes by looking at the wave packets evolution that rather big components of the two waves get trapped around the starting positions due to the well depth . at the same time , the tails of the initial packets are able to propagate , being responsible for the superballistic behavior .",
    "now by taken @xmath88 we obtain a completely different picture , we observe an oscillatory movement of the centroids , see fig .",
    "[ e-2u4s1 ] .",
    "the wave corresponding to each of the particles get trapped in a very small region and one notices that they strongly overlap in such a way that when one is moving to the right the other perform a displacement to the left and vice versa .",
    "the up and down spin wave packets get entangled with each other .",
    "the trapping of the wave packets can be understood by noticing that the sites covered by the gaussians are degenerate with on - site energies very different from the rest of the lattice , thus inhibiting hopping to distant sites .",
    "the behavior of the msd s proportional to @xmath98 is due to the escaping of the tails of the initial wave packets that can hop to the near degenerate sites .",
    "this case serve to indicate that the propagating properties can not be inferred only from the msd . in this connection we resort to 3d graphs that show the way the packets evolve in time .    .",
    "[ e-2u8s0 ]    increasing the interaction factor to @xmath99 and taken @xmath100 we obtain a similar behavior than the one described above for @xmath95 , see fig .",
    "[ e-2u8s0 ] . for the same u and @xmath88",
    "we observe the same entanglement that occurs for @xmath95 , with the difference that the period of the oscillation of the centroids is larger in the present case , see fig .",
    "[ e-2u8s1 ] .",
    "we treat now the case in which the impurity levels are deeper , i.e. , at @xmath101 . for the initially well localized packets , @xmath67 , and the interaction @xmath95",
    ", we note that the centroids tend to get near to each other until they fill the repulsion , but they do not depart very much and later on they repeat the tendency to get closer . as for the msd",
    "s the values are much smaller than the corresponding for @xmath94 . by looking at the evolution of the wave packets in the 3d graphs",
    "it is evident that the packets get trapped due to the deepness of the wells , see fig .  [ e-4u4s0 ] .",
    "considering now more extended initial wave packets , @xmath88 , we note that the centroids depart from each other , the msd s show ballistic behavior due to the escaping tales of the initial wave packets . as for the time evolution of the up and down wave functions we observe that they get trapped around the starting positions",
    ". a small amount of the amplitude of each of the up and down waves show a tendency to overlap with the other , see fig .",
    "[ e-4u4s1 ] .",
    "now for a strong interaction , @xmath99 and taken @xmath67 , we observe that the centroids tend to approximate while the msd s values are much smaller than the corresponding to @xmath102 . due to the deeper impurities levels , the packets get trapped in a very small region of the lattice , see fig .",
    "[ e-4u8s0 ] .",
    "when we take more extended initial packets , i.e. , @xmath88 , the centroids tend to depart from each other , the msd s are larger than the corresponding to the former case , @xmath67 , and the wave packets perform the same kind of oscillations , see fig .",
    "[ e-4u8s1 ] .",
    "the time limit taken in our calculation was @xmath103sec , longer than any reasonable collision time , this implies that in order to avoid undesirable boundary effects , we have included lattices up to 1000 sites .",
    "we used the runge - kutta method to integrate the equations of motion .",
    "in this work we analyzed the role the electron - electron interaction plays in one - dimensional disordered systems , in particular , a crystalline lattice with impurities . two electrons with opposite spins",
    "were introduced in a band where their interaction was assumed along the hubbard model .",
    "we have obtained the energy spectrum of a crystal considering different values of the interaction strength .",
    "the obtained density of states show that for sufficiently large @xmath21 , two bands are present separated by a gap of intensity @xmath104 .",
    "the lower band has the feature of the one corresponding to a single particle in a 2d crystal , while the excited band has the structure of a 1d tight - binding crystal .      in the non - interacting case , @xmath77 , we show that by increasing the extension of the packets , one reduces the msd values , the more so , the more extended the initial wave packets , they become more `` massive '' .    in the case of a positive u , the obtained msd increases rapidly from the non interacting case @xmath77 . for negative @xmath21 , a different initial behavior is observed . as @xmath21 is near the origin the msd decrease until a minimum value is achieved , and from then on it increases reaching a plateau .",
    "for both the positive and negative values of @xmath21 there exists a cross over region as explained in the text .",
    "next we analyze the propagation that takes place when we introduce the two interacting particles at impurity sites in an otherwise periodic crystal .",
    "we have encountered situations for which the msd as function of time presents superballistic behavior , although when looking at the packet we realize that most of it get trapped in a small region of the lattice .",
    "that is why the propagating properties can not be inferred from the msd alone .",
    "when we consider moderate impurity levels , in our case @xmath105 , the response of the system with regard to the initial conditions are very different .",
    "in fact , when we start with very well localized particles , @xmath67 , the centroids depart from each other for every intensity of the interaction , while for the less localized initial packets , @xmath88 , the two particles get entangled , trapped in the impurity region , we observe the centroids performing a periodic movement .",
    "when considering deeper impurity levels such as @xmath101 no matter what the extension of the initial waves packets are , the result indicate that the particles remain localized around the starting positions , this is true for every interaction strength ."
