    ".25 in simple tight binding models of mesoscopic systems have been quite extensively studied in recent times @xcite-@xcite with a view to understand the basic features of electronic transport in quantum dots ( qd ) or the magneto - transport in closed loop geometries such as an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) ring .",
    "one reason behind such model studies is definitely the simple geometry of the models which enables one to derive exact results and to look into the possible causes of certain salient features observed in the transport properties of real life small scale semiconducting or metallic systems .",
    "the other reason can be attributed to the immense success of nano - technology and the use of precision instruments such as a scanning tunnel microscope ( stm ) which can be used to build low dimensional nanostructures with tailor - made geometries .",
    "one such geometry , which will be our concern in this communication , is an ab ring threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath0 and with a finite segment of @xmath1 atomic sites attached to one arm of the ring at an arbitrary point .",
    "the central feature of electron transport across an ab ring is the periodic oscillation in the magnetoconductance whenever the phase coherence length exceeds the dimension of the sample @xcite .",
    "bttiker et al @xcite provided an early formulation of the problem .",
    "the transport in such a closed geometry was re - addressed by gefen et al @xcite who obtained an exact expression for the two - terminal conductance across the ring . using a discrete tight binding formulation the two - terminal conductance",
    "was also examined by damato et al @xcite , and subsequently , by aldea et al @xcite .",
    "a non - trivial change in the transport of an ab ring is observed when the ring contains a quantum dot ( qd ) either embedded in an arm , or side coupled to it @xcite-@xcite .",
    "motivated by the experiment of yacoby et al @xcite , yeyati and bttiker @xcite prescribed an exact formulation of the magnetoconductance of an ab ring with a qd embedded in its arm .",
    "a similar problem with a multi - terminal geometry was later addressed by kang @xcite .",
    "the qd - ab ring hybrid system also received attention in relatively recent experiments by meier et al @xcite and kobayashi et al @xcite-@xcite with a focus on the study of single electron charging and suppression of ab oscillations @xcite , and the fano resonance in the magnetoconductance @xcite-@xcite .    in a quantum dot",
    "discrete energy levels arise as a consequence of confinement of electrons in all three directions .",
    "this has inspired a considerable number of theoretical works involving a discrete lattice of the so called ` single level ' qd s @xcite , mimicked by ` atomic ' sites arranged either in an open geometrical arrangement or in a closed ab ring within a tight binding formalism .",
    "for example ,",
    "qd s , single , or in an array , side coupled to an open chain have already received attention in the context of kondo effect @xcite , one electron transport @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and dicke effect @xcite . the prospect of engineering fano resonances @xcite-@xcite , design of spin filters @xcite and the localization - delocalization problem @xcite in a series of atomic clusters side coupled to an infinite lattice",
    "have also been discussed in details .    motivated by such simple models which , inspite of their simplicity , brings out the rich quantum coherence effects exhibited by a mesoscopic system , we re - visit the problem of magneto - transport in an ab ring threaded by a magnetic flux , but now with a chain of @xmath1 atomic sites ( an array of _ single level qd s _ ) attached to one arm of the ring .",
    "inspite of the previous studies we believe that the interplay of the closed loop geometry and the eigenvalue spectrum of the dangling qd array is little studied and , is likely to provide new features in the electronic transport , that might throw some light on the potential of such systems as novel quantum devices .",
    "this is our main objective .",
    "we focus on the role of the ring - dot coupling in particular , and come across several interesting results .",
    "for example , it is found that the ring - dot system displays a ` switching ' action for small values of the ring - dot coupling at selected energies of the electron when the flux penetrating the ring is @xmath2 .",
    "the energy values ( at which the switching takes place ) , for a given size of the qd array coupled to the ring , belong to the set of eigenvalues of the isolated qd array , and depend on the number of scatterers in the upper and the lower arms of the ring . a gradual increase in the ring - dot coupling",
    "suppresses the ab oscillations and is accompanied by occasional transmission phase - reversals at specific values of the magnetic flux .    in what follows ,",
    "we present the model and the method in section ii .",
    "section iii contains the results and the related discussion and we draw conclusion in section iv .    .25 in",
    ".25 in we begin by referring to fig.1 .",
    "the ring contains @xmath3 atoms in the upper arm , excluding the sites marked @xmath4 and @xmath5 where the leads join the ring .",
    "the site marked @xmath6 in the lower arm is the point where the dangling qd chain is attached .",
    "there are @xmath7 sites to the left of @xmath6 and @xmath8 sites to its right . changing @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "therefore shifts the location of the attachment of the ` defect ' chain .",
    "the hamiltonian of the lead - ring - dot - lead system , in the standard tight binding form , is written as , @xmath9 where , @xmath10 in the above , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 represent the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the leads , the ring and the qd chain respectively . @xmath14@xmath15 and",
    "@xmath16 represent the same at the lead - ring connecting sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the on - site potential at the leads , in the qd chain and in the bulk of the ring is taken to be @xmath17 for every site including the site marked @xmath6 .",
    "the lead - ring connecting sites have been assigned the on - site potentials @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the amplitude of the hopping integral is taken to be @xmath20 throughout except the hopping from the site @xmath6 in the ring to the first site of the qd chain , which has been symbolized as @xmath21 and represents the ` strength ' of coupling between the ring and the qd array .",
    "@xmath22 is given by @xmath23 , where , @xmath0 is the flux threading the ring and @xmath24 is the fundamental flux quantum .",
    "the task of solving the schrdinger equation to obtain the stationary states of the system can be reduced to an equivalent problem of solving a set of the following difference equations :    for the sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 at the ring - lead junctions , @xmath25 in the above , @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the amplitudes of the wave function at the sites on the lead which are closest to the points @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the subscripts refer to the ` upper ' and the ` lower ' arms respectively .",
    "for the sites in the bulk of the ring the equations are , @xmath30 where , by @xmath31 and @xmath32th we symbolize the sites to the right and to the left of the @xmath33th site in any arm of the ring .",
    "for the site marked @xmath6 in the lower arm of the ring , the equation is , @xmath34 @xmath35 implying the sites to the right and to the left of the site marked @xmath6 respectively .",
    "finally , for the qd array we have the following set of difference equations , @xmath36 where the central set of equations above refer to the bulk sites viz .",
    "@xmath37 in the qd array .",
    "the process of calculating the transmission coefficient across such a ring - dot system consists of the following steps .",
    "first , the dangling qd chain is ` wrapped ' into an effective site by decimating the amplitudes @xmath38 to @xmath39 from eq.(6 ) .",
    "the renormalized on - site potential of the first site of the qd array is given by @xcite , @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath42 , we simply have @xmath43 . here",
    ", @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the @xmath1th order chebyshev polynomial of the second kind , with @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "this ` effective ' site is coupled to the site marked @xmath6 in the lower arm of the ring via a hopping integral @xmath21 . in the second step , the effective site with on - site",
    "potential is further ` folded ' back into the site @xmath6 , whose renormalized on - site potential now reads @xcite , @xmath48 we now have a ring with @xmath3 atoms in the upper arm and an effective site at position @xmath6 in the lower arm , flanked by @xmath7 atoms on its left and @xmath8 atoms on the right , so that there is a total of @xmath49 atoms in the lower arm .",
    "this is just the case of a qd with an energy dependent on - site potential embedded in an arm of an ab - ring . in the final step , all the @xmath50 atoms are decimated using the set of appropriate difference equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , to reduce the ring into an effective _ diatomic molecule _ ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the renormalized values of the on - site potential at the two extremeties of the molecule are given by , @xmath51 where , for a fixed set of @xmath17 and @xmath20 , @xmath52^{-1}\\ ] ] the time reversal symmetry of the hopping integral between the atoms at @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the diatomic molecule is broken due to the flux threading the ring , and is given by , @xmath53 for the _ forward _ hopping from @xmath4 to @xmath5 and by @xmath54 for the _ backward _ hopping from @xmath5 to @xmath4 .",
    "the transmission coefficient across the effective diatomic molecule is given by @xcite ,    @xmath55    where , @xmath56 is the lattice constant in the leads , taken to be equal to one throughout the calculation . in what follws , we discuss various aspects of the electronic transmission across the ring - qd array system .",
    "we fix the on - site potential at all sites , including the qd chain , as @xmath17 and the hopping integrals has been kept equal to @xmath20 throughout , except the ring - qd array coupling @xmath21 .",
    "the ` defect ' that we hang from an otherwise perfect ring is thus only of a topological nature . .25 in",
    "in all transmission profiles the ring - dot coupling @xmath21 plays a crucial role . the first effect that we present is a supression of the ab oscillations as a function of @xmath21 .",
    "we choose the energy @xmath57 from a specially selected set obtained by solving the equation @xmath58 .",
    "for these @xmath57-values the suppression of the ab oscillations can be directly worked out from our formulation .",
    "it is to be appreciated that the eigenvalues of the isolated quantum dot array are obtained by solving the polynomial equation @xmath59 @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we select any one of the roots , name it @xmath60 , and fix @xmath61 .",
    "this last condition is important .",
    "a close look at the expression of @xmath62 reveals that for @xmath63 ( in fact , for any real root of the equation @xmath59 ) we get @xmath64 .",
    "this leads to the following reduced forms of @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 we observe that the ring - dot coupling @xmath21 does not appear in any of these expressions .",
    "this is because of the selection @xmath63 and a non - zero @xmath21 , however small .",
    "let us now define , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "with these , the transfer matrix elements for the _ diatomic molecule _ read , @xmath70 e^{-i(l+1)\\gamma } \\nonumber \\\\ m_{12 } & = & -\\frac{\\xi_2u_l}{t_0 } e^{-i(l+1)\\gamma } \\nonumber \\\\ m_{21 } & = & \\frac{\\xi_1u_l}{t_0 } e^{-i(l+1)\\gamma } \\nonumber \\\\ m_{22 } & = & -u_l e^{-i(l+1)\\gamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally , the transmission coefficient is given by , @xmath71}{|d_1|^2 + |d_2|^2}\\ ] ] where , @xmath72 \\nonumber \\\\",
    "d_2 & = & e^{-i(l+1)\\gamma } \\left ( \\frac{\\xi_1\\xi_2u_l}{t_0 ^ 2 } - \\frac{u_l^2 + 1}{u_l }   \\right )   \\sqrt{1-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4t_0 ^ 2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as we observe , @xmath73 and @xmath74 and hence @xmath75 , are independent of the flux .",
    "that is , the ab - oscillations are suppressed whenever the fermi energy coincides with any of the discrete eigenvalues of the isolated qd - array .    in view of the above calculation",
    ", a few pertinent observations should be given due importance .",
    "let us detune @xmath57 slightly from an eigenvalue of the qd - array .",
    "that is , let s set @xmath76 , @xmath77 being very small .",
    "how does the shape of the ab - oscillation get altered in the neighborhood of @xmath63 ? in this case we have , @xmath78 clearly , if @xmath61 , but very very small so that @xmath79 , then the analysis as given above , is not valid , as @xmath62 is not _ infinity _ any more . as a result , we shall observe ab - oscillations in the transmission spectrum in general .",
    "if we gradually increase the value of @xmath21 so that @xmath80 , or even smaller , then we essentially keep on making @xmath81 and hence @xmath82 larger and larger .",
    "this results in the gradual suppression of the amplitude of the ab - oscillations , and finally , when @xmath81 becomes a very large number ( dictated by the machine precision ) , the transmission coefficient ( @xmath75 ) becomes independent of the flux threading the ring .",
    "ab - oscillations disappear completely .",
    "an interesting feature of the ab oscillations in such cases is that , a gradual increase in the value of @xmath21 can lead either to @xmath83 ( fig.2a ) or to @xmath84 ( figs.2b and 2c ) .",
    "this depends on the combination of the size of the ring ( i.e. on @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) and the length of the qd array ( @xmath1 ) . in every case",
    "however , the progress towards @xmath83 or @xmath84 is accompanied by a gradual suppression of the ab oscillations .",
    "most interestingly , for a set of values of @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 , the phase of the ab oscillations is reversed at specific values of the magnetic flux as soon as @xmath21 exceeds some ` critical ' value . incidentally , a similar observation in a simpler geometry was reported by kubala and knig as well @xcite .",
    "the present cases are depicted in fig.@xmath85(b ) and @xmath85(c ) where the reversal is observed at @xmath2 and @xmath86 ( odd multiple of @xmath87 in general ) . however , with different combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1 , the reversal can take place at other flux values as well , for example at @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we have not been able to obtain exact criterion for the phase reversal .",
    "however , extensive numerical search has revealed that this is true for various combinations of the size of the ring and the length of the qd array .    before ending",
    ", it should be mentioned that , the flux indepence that we have discussed above , is basically caused by the divergence of @xmath82 at special energies .",
    "this divergence can also be achieved for any arbitrary energy other that the eigenvalues of the isolated qd array , by letting @xmath90 .",
    "such a situation , as we have carefully observed , but do not report here to save space , leads to a flux independent @xmath91 spectrum .      at first",
    ", we note that , for @xmath92 , i.e. , for an equal number ( @xmath3 ) atoms in the two arms , and with @xmath93 , the @xmath94 hopping integral in the effective _ diatomic molecule _ is real , and reads , @xmath95 @xmath96 is of course , equal to @xmath97 .",
    "it is now clear that for @xmath2 , the effective hopping integral becomes zero , resulting in @xmath84 ( an antiresonance ) independent of the energy of the electron .",
    "as soon as the ring - dot coupling @xmath21 assumes a non - zero value , interesting transmission behavior is observed . to get a clearer understanding",
    ", we refer to fig.3 , which is a ring with just one atom in both the lower and the upper arms with a single qd with an on - site potential @xmath98 coupled to the atom in the lower arm .",
    "this is a simple modification of the model used by kubala and knig @xcite . for this simple geometry , with @xmath61 , we get , @xmath99}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 and @xmath54 .",
    "using these , one can work out the transfer matrix elements for the _ diatomic molecule _",
    ", in the limit @xmath101 , to be equal to , @xmath102 where , @xmath103 . inserting these values in the formula for the transmission coefficient , it is observed that @xmath83 for @xmath104 with any @xmath61 .",
    "that is , the presence of a finite ring - dot coupling , however small , triggers ballistic transmission across the ring .    with an arbitrary number of scatteres in either arm of the ring , and the qd array extending beyond one atom , the situation is non - trivial and closed form expressions look extremely cumbersome to deal with .",
    "we have conducted extensive and careful numerical investigation to examine several cases . here ,",
    "details of a specific case are given which reflect the generic features of the _ selective switching _",
    "effect that we wish to highlight .",
    "we choose a situation where the qd array contains , for example , five atoms ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the on - site potential @xmath17 and the hopping integral @xmath20 are set equal to zero and unity everywhere , including the qd array .",
    "we set the magnetic flux @xmath2 , and select @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath108-site qd chain is now diagonalized to get the eigenvalues @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 . with @xmath21 set equal to zero , as discussed before , we get @xmath84 irrespective of energy @xmath57 .",
    "interestingly , it is found that , by choosing a small non - zero value of @xmath21 and an appropriate set of values for @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but always satisfying the requirement @xmath106 and @xmath107 , it is possible to make the ring - dot system _ completely transparent _ to an incoming electron when its energy becomes equal to some or all of the eigenvalues of the @xmath108-site qd array .",
    "the transmission at any energy outside the set of five eigenvalues mentioned above can be completely suppressed if @xmath21 is kept small enough . however , a gradual increase in the value of @xmath21 gives rise to secondary transmission peaks as the ring ` interacts ' with the qd more strongly .",
    "these secondary peaks finally settle into bands of transmission separated by transmission dips , as a result of quantum interference . the important thing to appreciate",
    "is that whether we observe complete transparency at a subset of the eigenvalues or for all of them , depends strongly on the mutual tuning of the values of the ring - dot coupling @xmath21 and @xmath3 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "fig.4 displays the slective switching action when the qd array contains @xmath112 and @xmath108 sites respectively ( fig.4a and 4b ) . in fig.4a , setting @xmath113 and attaching the array to an @xmath114 ring ( like one shown in fig.2 ) , we see that the transmission coefficient is unity ( or very close to it ) only when energy @xmath57 is equal to the three eigenvalues of the isolated @xmath112-dot array , viz , at @xmath115 and @xmath116 . on the other hand , with @xmath105 ( fig.4b ) , with @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 , transmission is triggered only at three of the five eigenvalues .",
    "the scenario of course changes as the parameters are varied , keeping @xmath21 small .",
    "however , the ` smallness ' of @xmath21 is to be selected by trial method , at least so far as we have checked . in table 1",
    ", we provide a list of such selective values for which @xmath83 ( or very close to it ) at @xmath2 .",
    ".3 in     @xmath120 at @xmath121 + ( 12k-1,6k-1,6k-1 ) & arbitrary & no peak at all + ( 12k-7,6k-4,6k-4 ) & 0.04 & @xmath109 , @xmath111 + ( 12k-5,6k-3,6k-3 ) & 0.04 - 0.045 & @xmath110 , @xmath111 + ( 12k+3,6k+1,6k+1 ) & 0.04 - 0.045 & @xmath110 , @xmath111 + ( 12k-11,6k-6,6k-6 ) & 0.05 - 0.10 & @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 + ( 12k-3,6k-2,6k-2 ) & 0.05 - 0.10 & @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 +    .25 in table 1",
    ". some typical combinations of @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and the ring - dot coupling @xmath21 that give rise to selective swithing at @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath122 is a positive integer .",
    ".3 in before we end , it should be noted that the geometry dealt with in the present communication can equivalently be thought as a discrete part ( the lower arm plus the qd array ) to an infinite linear chain ( the left lead plus the upper arm plus the right lead ) .",
    "considering no magnetic field , we expect fano lineshapes in the transmission spectrum as a result of an ` interaction ' of the discrete spectrum of the lower parts with the continuous spectrum offered by the upper section @xcite,@xcite .",
    "indeed there are such lineshapes in the transmission resonances , which however get masked due to quantum interference as we take larger and larger size of the ring as well as the qd array .",
    "we have addressed the issue of transmission across an aharonov - bohm ring with a dangling chain of single level quantum dots within a tight binding formalism . in presence of a magnetic flux threading the ring",
    ", we discuss the role of the ring - dot coupling in controlling the profile of transmission oscillations .",
    "the central feature is a suppression of the ab oscillations with occasional reversal of phase at specific values of the flux .",
    "most interestingly , it is found that , a simultaneous adjustment of the number of scatterers in the arms of the ring and the ring - dot coupling can lead to a complete transparency of the system at some or all of the eigenvalues of the qd array .",
    "it is important to note that a bigger ring with large values of @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( always satisfying the condition @xmath107 , @xmath106 and @xmath2 ) exhibits ballistic transmission @xmath83 for rather low values of the ring - dot coupling @xmath21 .",
    "this is because , with a bigger ring the coupled qd array stays far away from the junctions @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the ` end effects ' are thus minimised .",
    "we have also tested these features with a qd array formed according to the quasiperiodic fibonacci growth rule @xcite .",
    "the essential features like the self - similarity in the electronic transmission are also observed in the selective switching case .",
    "such aspects will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "<S> * abstract *    .25 in we report electronic transmission properties of a simple tight binding aharonov - bohm ring threaded by a magnetic flux , to one arm of which a finite cluster of atoms has been attached from one side . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , by suitably choosing the number of scatterers in each arm of the quantum ring , the transmission across the ring can be completely blocked when the ring is decoupled from the atomic cluster and the flux threading the ring becomes equal to half the fundamental flux quantum . </S>",
    "<S> a novel transmission resonance then occurs immediately as the coupling between the ring and the impurity cluster is switched ` on ' . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the delta - like transmission resonances occur precisely at the eigenvalues of the side coupled chain of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the ` switching ' effect can be observed either for all the eigenvalues of the isolated atomic cluster , or for a selected set of them , depending on the number of scatterers in the arms of the ring . </S>",
    "<S> the ring - dot coupling can be gradually increased to suppress the oscillations in the magneto - transmission completely . </S>",
    "<S> however , the suppression can lead either to a complete transparency or no transmission at all , occasionally accompanied by a reversal of phase at special values of the magnetic flux .    .25 in </S>"
