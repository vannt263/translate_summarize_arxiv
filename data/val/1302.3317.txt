    "neyman and scott ( 1952 , 1953b ) , using statistical techniques based on counts - in - cells , showed that the galaxy distribution is statistically clustered rather than statistically uniform , and on the other , abell actually identified from palomar sky survey plates , 2712 operationally well - defined rich clusters of galaxies ( abell 1958 ) . to better describe the clustering property , the two - point correlation function ( peebles 1973 ) and continual high order correlation functions ( croton et al 2004 ) are widely used .",
    "high density regions , such as filaments ( wu et al . 2012 ) , superclusters ( connolly et al . 1996 ) and low density regions , such as voids ( danny et al . 2012 ) , are discovered and well discussed . at the same time , people begin to have interest for the comparison of high density and low density region .",
    "if the early universe is grown from quantum fluctuations , then positive and negative fluctuations will have the same probability and a sponge - like structure ( high density regions have the same topology with low density regions ) is doomed ( gott 1986 ) . with the evolution dominated by gravitational instability ,",
    "the sponge - like structure is most likely remained whatever the growth stays in the linear regime or is damped ( bond & szalay 1983 ) .",
    "gott ( 1986 ) found that both two regions have similar properties from the measured density contours , such as sponge - like shape , connectedness .",
    "however , gott ( 1986 ) mentioned a direct test more than measuring density contours is needed .",
    "here we use the hexagon cell method to investigate the equivalent of high density and low density regions .",
    "our hexagon cell method is inherited from the dodecahedron cells ( kiang 2003 , kiang et al 2004 ) ; it is actually a 2-d application of dodecahedron cells method .",
    "different cells have been applied to analyze the topology of galaxy distribution , such as truncated octahedrons ( coxeter 1937 ; gott 1967 ; gott 1986 ) , voronoi foams ( icke and weygaert 1987 ) , dodecahedron cells ( kiang 2004 ) ; 2d topological structure of the observed universe has been investigated by variety of methods , such as genus method ( davies & coles 1993 , colley 1997 , hoyle & vogeley 2001 , hoyle et al 2002 ) , percolation and ?",
    "lamentarity ( pandey & bharadwaj 2008 ) .",
    "colley ( 1997 ) found that the 2d genus of the las campanas redshift survey is very close to a gaussian random field , hoyle claimed the genus of 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey team ( 2dfgrs ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) reveals a smaller number of isolated voids than clusters ( hoyle & vogeley 2001 , hoyle et al 2002 ) .    the motivation of this paper is to investigate the topological relation between low density regions ( such as voids ) and high density regions ( such as clusters ) to get more understanding of the early universe .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the hexagon cells method . in section 3",
    "we study the data from the 2mass .",
    "we summarize the results in section 4 and have conclusions in section 5 .",
    "if we partition the 2-d space into cells with the shape of hexagon , we can get hexagonal lattice .",
    "hexagonal lattice is one of the five 2d lattice types and is the only lattice which can fill the 2d space inseparably with more edges than square . in the natural world",
    ", honeycomb is an interesting example of hexagonal lattice . for bees , hexagon is the most efficient shape for the bees living and storing of food . in the reality ,",
    "the hexagon structure provides the maximum strength and that it is used in designing airplane wings and satellites walls .",
    "the reason of using hexagon cells in this paper is that we want to have the direction detection as many as possible for our unit cells .",
    "hexagon cells could detect the neighbors in six directions and provide us the rich topology information , and at the same time fill in the space without overlap or missing region .",
    "for an application of hexagon method on galaxy distribution , similar with the definition of rhombic cell in kiang ( 2003 ) , if a hexagon cell contains no galaxies , then we call it an empty cell ; otherwise , it is a filled cell . automatically empty cells represent the low density region and filled cells represent the high density region . by this definition",
    ", we could discover if the filled and empty regions have the same morphology and give us a quantitative description of the topology .",
    "we know the hexagons have 6 neighbors and 6 edges shared with neighbors .",
    "if two neighbor cells are both filled or both empty , then we define their common edges as inner edge ; otherwise we call it as outer edge .",
    "we use n to define the number of inner edges .",
    "the physical meaning of n is to find the same kind of neighbors for each hexagon and investigate the aggregation pattern for filled and empty cells . in this way",
    "n is the approximation of the two point correlation function in a specific small scale .",
    "if filled cells are not distributed in space randomly , we can expect the distribution of n will be depart from the well - known binomial form , same thing for empty cells .",
    "this in turn will tell us the morphology similarity and difference of high density and low density regions .",
    "based on the definition of @xmath0 , we could divide the six edges into inner edges and outer edges two groups and consider the connectedness of inner edges or outer edges .",
    "we use @xmath2 to represent the number of connected inner edges group and use @xmath3 to represent the number of connected outer edges group , that is @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . so @xmath4 means a single cell surrounded by 6 unlike neighbors ( same with @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 means a single cell surrounded by 6 like neighbors ( same with @xmath7 ) .",
    "@xmath8 means likely that the cell is on the boundary of the clusters or voids , so its two kind of neighbors are connected separately .",
    "@xmath9 represents a string - like structure and the string penetrates the cell and results in two groups for each of kind neighbors .",
    "@xmath10 is complicated and its special shape possibly implies a mesh structure .",
    "to better understand the @xmath0 and @xmath1 distribution difference between observed and random sample , similar with the method mentioned by kiang ( 2003 ) , we define statistic @xmath12 as a measure of the degree to which the observed frequency of cells exceeds its random expectation for each different structure defined by @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath13 is for observed sample , @xmath14 is for random sample .      to investigate the uncertainties of the results , we use same method which kiang ( 2004 ) used in rhombic cell analysis .",
    "obviously the present application of hexagon cell analysis revealed that @xmath0 and @xmath1 results are highly sensitive to the exact placing of the grid of hexagon cells . because when the galaxies are fixed , if the cells are moved it will get same galaxies to lie in different cells , we call it as the zero offset .",
    "we start our calculations by placing the centre of our zeroth cell ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) at galactic coordinates ( 0,0,0 ) .",
    "what we found was that if we displace our entire grid of cells by an amount up to and including one unit of a0 , in any combination of the three directions , then the resulting @xmath0 and @xmath15 will generally be different , but slightly .",
    "if we define the length of cell is 1 , we simply consider 4 shifts which are ( 0 , 0.5 ) , ( -0.5,0 ) , ( 0.5,0 ) , ( 0.5,0.5 ) .",
    "the four shifts will be combined with the origin gridding to get average @xmath0 and @xmath15 value with stand deviation .",
    "generally the shift will result in the unequal number of filled and empty cells , but it is very tiny ( around 1/1,000 ) , moreover , it makes more sense for us to keep the length of the cell rather than adjusting it to get equal number of filled and empty cells , so we fix the length of cells when we shift .",
    "the 2mass ( xsc , jarrett et al . 2000 ) data we use is provided by cao et al ( 2006 ) , detailed information can be found in their paper . simply speaking , they select galaxies inside an elliptical isophote with surface brightness of 20 mag @xmath16 in ks band . to have 2-d plane data , they subject the 2mass data to an equal - area projection by the lambert azimuthal algorithm :    @xmath17    where @xmath14 is a relative scale factor , @xmath18 is the galactic latitude and @xmath19 is the galactic longitude .",
    "this hemisphere scheme projects the whole sky into two circular planes , a northern and southern sky .",
    "we select a square with @xmath20 in the central part of each circular plane .",
    "we have two fields of @xmath20 in the northern and southern skies .",
    "the northern square has 323,000 galaxies and the southern includes 342,000 galaxies .",
    "before we analyze the data , we could get the binomial distribution for reference .",
    "the binomial distribution gives the discrete probability distribution @xmath21 of obtaining exactly @xmath22 successes out of @xmath23 bernoulli trials ( where the result of each bernoulli trial is true with probability @xmath24 and false with probability @xmath25 , as given by eq.4 below : ) .",
    "@xmath26    since for any neighbors of a cell , the probability of a filled or empty cell is the same ( we have the same number of filled and empty cells ) , so @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for an @xmath0 distribution , @xmath29 ( 6 walls for hexagon ) , and n=(0,1,2,4,5,6 ) . from eq . ( 4 ) the probability function of a binomial distribution is ( 1/64 , 6/64 , 15/64 , 20/64 , 15/64 , 6/64 , 1/64 ) for n= ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) . for @xmath1 , since this is related to specific arrangements , it is better to list all combinations and calculate the probability than using eq.(4 ) .",
    "since there are 6 walls , each wall could be inner wall or outer wall , so the total combinations give @xmath30 arrangements .",
    "if we use `` 1 '' for inner wall , and `` 0 '' for outer wall , we could write number 0  63 with 6-digits binary format , such as 000000 , 000001 .... then the 64 binaries are exactly all possible arrangements of @xmath1 .",
    "we list the results in table 1 :    . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath31 from @xmath0=6 ( or @xmath6 ) filled cells have a much stronger ( 21@xmath32 for northern sky and 15@xmath32 for southern sky ) aggregation property than empty cells .",
    "this is consistent with hoyle ( 2002 ) who found that the number of isolated voids is smaller than the number of clusters in the 2df survey .",
    "@xmath31 the most general case is @xmath33 ( 20/64 probability for standard distribution ) ; however , we can see the @xmath0 value at @xmath33 is smaller than standard distribution .",
    "this can be explained as that aggregation makes filled and empty cells have more probability on @xmath34 than standard distribution , hence reduce the probability at @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath31 for @xmath0=1 , filled cells are closer ( 12@xmath32 for northern sky and 6@xmath32 for southern sky ) to standard distribution than empty cells , which implies that empty cells have less or longer fiber structure than filled cells as the end of fiber always has @xmath0=1 .",
    "@xmath0=1 must result in a @xmath8 structure , we do not see much difference between filled and empty cells for @xmath8 in table 1 .",
    "this suggests @xmath0=1 structure is the minority in most @xmath8 structures , in other words , @xmath8 includes much more cells on the boundary of filled and empty cells than of the end .",
    "@xmath31 @xmath9 has also significant difference ( 12@xmath32 for northern sky and 8@xmath32 for southern sky ) between filled and empty cells .",
    "empty cells have much more frequently penetrated by filled cells than filled cells penetrated by empty cells , which implies that empty cells have less fiber structure than filled cells and is consistent with @xmath0=1 results .",
    "with a direct measurement by the hexagon cell method , we found there are significant differences in topology between high density regions and low density regions in 2mass data .",
    "the accuracy is assured by the zeroshift technique .",
    "we found low density regions have less fiber structure and are less clustered than high density regions to high accuracy .",
    "the difference could be caused by the evolution , which suggests that evolution might include more things other than gravitational instability ( bond @xmath35 szalay 1983 ) ; or caused by the original asymmetry of quantum fluctuation in the early universe ( turner 1998 ) . overall speaking ,",
    "low density regions have slightly closer topology to random distribution than high density regions .",
    "we also found the topology of 2mass southern sky map is slightly closer to random distribution tan northern sky .",
    "our work provides a supplement for genus analysis , which shows that high density and low density regions have almost identical properties ( park et al , 2001 ; gott 1986 ) or are slightly different ( hoyle et al 2002 ) ."
