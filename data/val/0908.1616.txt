    "a fundamental challenge in nuclear physics is trying to understand the structure of hadrons in terms of their quark - gluon constituents , which are governed by the underlying theory of strong interaction called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "measurements of exclusive processes such as pion electroproduction make it possible to extract meson form factors and study the quark - gluon distributions in the nucleon .",
    "however , in order to develop a description of the atomic nucleus based on qcd , one also needs to understand how the properties and interactions of hadrons change in the nuclear medium .",
    "measurements of exclusive processes in the nuclear medium sometimes help one to understand the interactions because qcd has definite predictions for exclusive processes in the medium .",
    "one such prediction is the phenomenon of color transparency ( ct ) .    in the study of ct",
    ", we can observe the interplay between the creation of quark systems with small transverse size , as we would expect from qcd , and the possible suppression of interactions of such point - like configurations ( plc ) with the nuclear medium .",
    "a further complication is introduced by the formation time of the final hadron , which limits the lifetime of the plc . to understand this phenomenon , it is thus important to study the dependencies on the four - momentum transfer squared of the virtual photon , @xmath7 ( size of the initial plc , typically scales as @xmath11 ) , hadron momentum ( formation length ) , and target mass @xmath12 ( path length through the medium ) .    due to the higher probability to form a plc , a two - quark rather than a three - quark system",
    "is preferable , making pion electroproduction a natural choice for an initial study .",
    "however , pion electroproduction introduces the assumption of a quasi - free interaction of the photon with a virtual pion in the medium .",
    "the plausibility of this assumption can be addressed by comparing the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross sections from a nucleus with those obtained using a nucleon target , as differences in the behavior of this ratio would indicate effects of the nuclear medium resulting in the breakdown of the quasi - free assumption .",
    "nuclear transparency is a natural observable in the quest to identify the onset of color transparency .",
    "nuclear transparency is defined as the ratio of the cross section per nucleon for a process on a bound nucleon inside a nucleus to that from a free nucleon .",
    "since the nuclear medium is not opaque to hadrons , color transparency will lead to an increase in nuclear transparency as a function of momentum transfer , hadron momentum and target mass .",
    "this simultaneous increase of nuclear transparency is distinct from those from other conventional processes such as rescattering .",
    "moreover , it illustrates the need for careful experiment design that simultaneously measures the @xmath7 and @xmath12 dependence of nuclear transparency and at the same time tests alternative reaction mechanisms that can produce potential increases in nuclear transparency .    with the availability of high - intensity ,",
    "continuous electron beams up to 6 gev at jefferson lab it became possible for the first time to determine simultaneously the @xmath12 and @xmath7 dependences of the differential pion cross sections for @xmath7 in the 1 - 5 gev@xmath2 range .",
    "these data were acquired in 2004 for @xmath1h , @xmath2h , @xmath3c , @xmath4al , @xmath5cu and @xmath6au targets .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath7 dependence of the extracted transparency were published in  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to describe the experiment and analysis and to present and discuss additional results .",
    "the article is organized as follows : the next sections describe methods for extracting nuclear transparencies and discuss some earlier data .",
    "section  [ sec : formalism ] introduces the basic cross section formalism of pion electroproduction . in section  [ sec : experiment ] the experiment is described including the experimental setup .",
    "the data analysis is described in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the determination of the cross sections and the extraction of the nuclear transparencies and their associated uncertainties are described in section  [ sec : dettransp ] and section  [ sec : sys ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the global features of the cross section ratio and the nuclear transparencies are discussed and a comparison is made with results of recent calculations .",
    "in a simple picture of pion electroproduction from the nucleus , the electron exchanges a virtual photon with a proton which is moving due to its fermi momentum .",
    "the struck proton turns into a neutron ejecting a positively charged pion ( quasi - free approximation ) . in the quasi - free picture ,",
    "the ejected pion may interact with the residual nucleons and the fraction of pions which can escape from the nucleus is the nuclear transparency of pions . in reality , the scattering process is more complicated and the deviations from this picture reveal much about the nucleus and their constituents . in the simple quasi - free picture ,",
    "the ratio of the longitudinal to transverse cross section from a bound proton inside the nucleus is expected to be the same as that from a free proton .",
    "assuming the dominance of the quasi - free process , one can extract the nuclear transparency of the pions by taking the ratio of the acceptance corrected cross sections from the nuclear target to those from the proton .",
    "nuclear transparency quantifies the interactions of the outgoing pion with the residual nucleons on its way out of the nuclei , and is thus the key observable in searching for ct effects .",
    "color transparency was first proposed by brodsky and mueller  @xcite in 1982 , and refers to the vanishing of the hadron - nucleon interaction for hadrons produced in exclusive processes . at sufficiently high momentum transfers , where the hadron is produced with small transverse size , @xmath13  @xcite",
    ", the fast - moving hadron also has a compact longitudinal size due to lorentz contraction .",
    "such a reduced size quark - gluon state is called a point - like configuration ( plc ) .",
    "the formation length , the distance over which the plc travels before the hadron reaches its final size can be written , @xmath14    assuming a linear expansion in time , where @xmath15 is the speed of the hadron in the lab frame and @xmath16 is the life time of the plc in its rest frame .",
    "qcd predicts that the cross section for the interaction of a small @xmath17 dipole is proportional to @xmath18 in the leading order approximation , where @xmath19 is the transverse separation between the @xmath20 and the @xmath21 .",
    "if the @xmath17 dipole remains small ( pointlike ) over the range of the nuclear system , the nucleus will be transparent to the produced hadron .",
    "this can be accomplished at large momentum transfers where the formation length is sufficiently large .    at finite energies , however , the mechanism for the expansion and contraction of the interacting small system is more complex .",
    "the quantum diffusion model  @xcite assumes that quarks separate in the transverse direction at the speed of light and that their quark separation is proportional to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the longitudinal distance from the production point to the position of the particle .",
    "the formation length in this model is determined from the average value of the dominant energy denominator . @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the momentum and mass of the hadron , respectively , while @xmath27 is the mass of a typical intermediate state of the hadron .",
    "the precise value for @xmath28 is a matter of great uncertainty  @xcite with estimates between 0.25 and 1.4 gev@xmath2 .",
    "the onset of color transparency is expected at lower energies for production of mesons , for instance of pions , than for production of baryons , because the quark - antiquark pair is more likely to form a small size object  @xcite .    in pion electroproduction ,",
    "the coherence length , defined as the distance over which the virtual photon fluctuates into a @xmath17 pair , is smaller than the nucleon radius at jlab energies , and for the present experiment it is essentially constant .",
    "this removes any coherence length dependence through t - channel @xmath29 exchange , in which the incident electron scatters from a virtual photon bringing it on - shell . such a coherence length dependence can mimic a ct - like energy dependence .",
    "color transparency has recently been put into the context of a qcd factorization theorem for longitudinally polarized photons in meson electroproduction .",
    "it predicts that for sufficiently high values of @xmath7 , at fixed @xmath30 and fixed momentum transfer to the nucleon , @xmath31 , the amplitude can be expressed in terms of a short - distance ( hard ) process , a distribution amplitude describing the final state meson , and generalized parton distributions ( gpds )  @xcite .",
    "the latter describe the long - distance ( soft ) physics .",
    "the factorization theorem has been proven at asymptotically high @xmath7 , but showing its validity at finite , high @xmath7 requires stringent tests of all necessary conditions .",
    "the unambiguous observation of the onset of ct is a critical precondition for the validity of the factorization theorem .",
    "this is because where ct applies the outgoing meson retains a small transverse size ( inter - quark distance ) while soft interactions like multiple gluon exchange between the meson produced from the hard interaction and the baryon are highly suppressed .",
    "factorization is thus rigorously not possible without ct .",
    "the first experiments designed to search for color transparency used the @xmath32 reaction and were performed at brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl )  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear transparency was defined as the ratio of the elastic @xmath33 cross section in the nucleus and hydrogen .",
    "this ratio initially increased as a function of the beam energy and then decreased , with a peak near 9 gev . though this behavior was not predicted by traditional nuclear physics calculations , it is currently not attributed to ct .",
    "instead it is associated with nuclear filtering  @xcite , which is related to the suppression of the long range components in the wave function , or to the threshold for charm resonance production  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear transparency was also measured using the a(@xmath34 ) reaction at stanford linear accelerator center ( slac )  @xcite and at jefferson lab  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the nuclear transparency was defined as the ratio of the experimental yield and the one obtained from plane wave impulse approximation .",
    "the ratio was found to be energy independent from @xmath7 @xmath35 2 gev@xmath2 to 8.1 gev@xmath2 for deuterium , carbon , iron , and gold targets , thus indicating no significant ct effect .",
    "the absence of the ct effect in this channel has been interpreted as an indication that the proton formation length may only have been as large as internucleonic distances , rather than the size of the nucleus in these experiments  @xcite .",
    "ct measurements using coherent and incoherent @xmath36 production have been performed at fermilab  @xcite and more recently at desy  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear transparency was defined as @xmath37 .",
    "the results from fermilab were parametrized with a function @xmath38 , and at a first glance , the observed positive slope of @xmath39 as a function of @xmath7 appeared to contradict the flat @xmath7 dependence predicted by the glauber multiple scattering mechanism .",
    "however , the results have since been interpreted as a coherence length effect  @xcite , in which for kinematics with large coherence length , the virtual @xmath17 pair may undergo interactions with the nucleus before the hard interaction that puts it on - shell .",
    "the kinematics of the fermilab experiment were not at a constant @xmath40 , and thus the variation of @xmath39 with @xmath7 was attributed to a reduction in the initial state interactions rather than to a reduction in final state interactions .",
    "the more recent measurements from desy , ranging between @xmath7=0.9 - 3 gev@xmath2 and at constant @xmath40 , showed a rise in nuclear transparency with @xmath7 consistent with theoretical calculations of ct  @xcite .",
    "the most convincing evidence for the existence of color transparency comes from an experiment performed at fermilab  @xcite .",
    "there , the cross section of diffractive dissociation of 500 gev/@xmath41 pions into dijets was measured and parametrized with @xmath42=@xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the @xmath45 cross section in free space .",
    "the free parameter , @xmath39 , was fit to the data with the result @xmath461.6 .",
    "this result was in agreement with calculations assuming 100% color transparency and was very different from the normal @xmath45 cross section , which has a dependence @xmath42=@xmath47 .    at low energies , hints of ct effects",
    "have also been observed from pion photoproduction from helium , @xmath48 , at jefferson lab  @xcite .",
    "ct can be measured in these reactions where @xmath7=0 by measuring the cross section vs. the four momentum transfer squared , @xmath49 to the hadron system .",
    "the data showed 2@xmath42 deviations from the traditional glauber calculations and the slope of the data vs. @xmath31 was in better agreement with calculations including ct .",
    "the kinematics of the pion electroproduction reaction studied here are shown in figure  [ fig : eepi_kinematics ] .",
    "the incident electron has a three momentum of @xmath50 .",
    "the scattered electron has a three momentum @xmath51 and travels at a polar angle @xmath52 in the laboratory frame with respect to the direction of the incident beam .",
    "the three momentum vectors of the incoming and outgoing electron define the scattering plane .",
    "the corresponding four - momenta are @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the virtual photon carries a four - momentum @xmath55 , which is given by @xmath56 .",
    "the reaction plane is defined by the three - momentum @xmath57 and the three - momentum vector of the produced pion @xmath58 and makes an angle @xmath59 with respect to the scattering plane . the angle ( in the lab system ) between @xmath60 and @xmath57 is @xmath61 .",
    "the pion electroproduction reaction can be described using three lorentz  invariants .",
    "in addition to @xmath7 , we use the invariant mass of the virtual photon - nucleon system , @xmath8 , which can be expressed as @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the proton mass , and @xmath64 is the mandelstam variable .      the pion electroproduction cross section from a stationary proton in the one photon - exchange approximation is  @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the virtual photon flux , where @xmath39 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the factor @xmath67 is the equivalent photon energy , and @xmath68 is the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "the two - fold differential cross section for a stationary proton target can be written as @xmath69 where the solid angle of the pion , @xmath70 is determined in the lab frame , and @xmath71 is the jacobian for the transformation from @xmath72 to @xmath73 . the two - fold cross section can be separated into four structure functions , which correspond to the polarization states of the virtual photon , a longitudinal ( l ) , a transverse(t ) , and two interference terms ( lt and tt ) : @xmath74 the interference terms vanish in parallel kinematics ( @xmath75 ) because of their dependence on @xmath76  @xcite .    the four structure functions can be separated if measurements at different values of @xmath77 and @xmath59 are performed ( l / t separation ) , where @xmath78 and @xmath49 are kept constant . the photon polarization @xmath77 can be varied by changing the electron energy and scattering angle .",
