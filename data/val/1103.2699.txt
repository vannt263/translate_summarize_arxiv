    "high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) is one of the most interesting nonlinear phenomena when atoms or molecules are exposed to an intense laser field @xcite .",
    "experimentally the harmonic fields generated by all atoms or molecules within the laser focus co - propagate with the fundamental laser field till they reach the detector . to compare with experimental measurements , theoretical harmonics from each atom or molecule first have to be calculated .",
    "the induced dipoles are then fed into the propagation equation , taking into account the focusing condition , the nature of the gas medium , and the equation is finally integrated till the harmonics are collected @xcite .",
    "hhg from randomly distributed molecules have been studied since the 1990 s @xcite . in recent years",
    ", experimental hhg studies tend to focus on partially aligned molecules @xcite . among the molecules ,",
    "co@xmath0 is likely the most extensively studied system so far @xcite .",
    "initially the interest was focused on the observation of the minimum in the hhg spectra of co@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the positions of the minima from different experiments , however , are often vastly different . according to the three - step model @xcite",
    ", hhg is generated through the recombination of the returning electrons with the molecular ion .",
    "the interference of electron waves from the two atomic centers , under some conditions , results in a minimum in the transition dipole , the simplest is the two - center interference model @xcite .",
    "in fact , recombination is an inverse process of photoionization .",
    "thus the transition dipole is the same as that in photoionization .",
    "any such minima have not been observed in photoionization , however , since in these measurements molecules are isotropically distributed .    from the theoretical side ,",
    "the alignment dependence of hhg was first studied using the strong - field approximation ( sfa ) ( or the lewenstein model ) @xcite .",
    "subsequently we developed a quantitative rescattering ( qrs ) theory @xcite for hhg which was a significant improvement on the lewenstein model .",
    "in qrs the accuracy of recombination is treated at the same level as in the photoionization process .",
    "using qrs , the hhg minimum is attributed to the minimum in the photoionization transition dipole between the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) and continuum molecular wave functions @xcite . for fixed - in - space co@xmath0 molecules the photoionization cross sections of homo indeed exhibit minima at small alignment angles .",
    "the experimental hhg spectra from partially aligned co@xmath0 have been explained reasonably well by qrs , including the harmonic intensities and the phase , so are the polarization and ellipticity of the harmonics @xcite .",
    "if hhg is generated from homo only , then one expects that the position of the minimum does not significantly change with laser intensity according to qrs theory .",
    "indeed , strong field ionization depends exponentially on the ionization potential i@xmath1 .",
    "the homo-1 and homo-2 orbitals in co@xmath0 are 4 and 4.4 ev more deeply bound than the homo @xcite , thus they are not expected to contribute significantly to the hhg spectra .",
    "however , it is also well known that tunneling ionization rates depend sensitively on the symmetry of the molecular orbital @xcite .",
    "the homo is a @xmath2 orbital .",
    "it means that at small alignment angles the ionization rates are small . for homo-2 , on the other hand , it is a @xmath3 orbital , thus it has large ionization rate when co@xmath0 molecules are parallel aligned .",
    "thus for small alignment angles , homo-2 may become important even though it is bound 4.4 ev deeper than the homo .",
    "( homo-1 is a @xmath4 orbital and thus not expected to contribute significantly to the hhg . )    the first step of hhg process is tunneling ionization .",
    "the alignment dependence of tunneling ionization rate is usually calculated using molecular ammosov - delone - krainov ( mo - adk ) theory @xcite or sfa . for most molecules that have been studied the two models",
    "give nearly identical alignment dependence ( after normalization ) .",
    "however , this is not the case for co@xmath0 .",
    "experimentally , the alignment dependence of co@xmath0 ionization reported by pavici _",
    "@xcite is very narrowly peaked near alignment angle of 46@xmath5 .",
    "it differs significantly from the predictions of mo - adk and sfa @xcite .",
    "in fact , so far all theoretical attempts @xcite have not been able to confirm the sharp alignment dependence reported in the experiment",
    ". furthermore , the observed hhg spectra from aligned molecules are inconsistent with the reported experimental alignment dependence of ionization @xcite .",
    "the hhg spectra of parallel aligned co@xmath0 have been studied in a number of experiments , with 800-nm lasers @xcite as well as lasers of longer wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it was observed that the position of the hhg minimum moved to higher photon energies as the laser intensity was increased . in smirnova _",
    "@xcite , such effects were interpreted in terms of the multi - channel interference ( between homo and homo-2 ) and the intricate hole dynamics .",
    "their calculations were based on hhg generated by a single - molecule response .",
    "they introduced filters into the theory such that only short trajectories contributed to the signals . in their calculation ,",
    "a relative phase between different channels due to strong - field ionization step was introduced `` by hand '' in order to obtain the good agreement with the measurement .    as noted at the beginning , to compare theoretically simulated hhg spectra of molecules with experimental ones , the effect of macroscopic propagation should be considered . practically , this has rarely been done . for atomic targets , propagation effect",
    "is usually included with single - atom induced dipoles calculated using the lewenstein model . only in a few rare occasions the atomic response",
    "is calculated more accurately by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) @xcite .",
    "it is also well - known that the lewenstein model does not predict the hhg spectra ( the intensity ) precisely , but the phases of the harmonics are relatively accurate .",
    "this fact is used in the qrs model , which can be understood as simply replacing the transition dipole calculated using plane waves in the lewenstein model by one calculated using accurate molecular continuum wave functions .",
    "the improvement of single - molecule hhg spectra calculated using qrs has been well documented in our previous publications @xcite .",
    "computationally , qrs is nearly as simple as the lewenstein model ( actually qrs is even simpler than sfa for polyatomic molecules , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , thus induced dipole can be easily obtained from qrs to feed into the propagation equations to account for medium propagation effects .",
    "this has been done for atomic targets for low - laser - intensity and low - gas - pressure conditions @xcite .",
    "it has been extended recently to the conditions of high intensity and high pressure for ar and to molecular targets @xcite , including polyatomic molecules @xcite .    in this paper , we report theoretical studies of the propagation effect on the hhg of co@xmath0 , including contributions from homo and homo-2 . note that experimentally the effect of propagation on the hhg spectra has rarely been investigated either , in particular , its effect on the minimum of the hhg spectra .",
    "however , this has changed recently with the reports of such studies on ar @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first summarize the equations used for the propagation calculations .",
    "we limit ourselves to low laser intensity and low pressure .",
    "to extend the theory to high intensity and high pressure , the optical properties of co@xmath0 have to be used and they are not available over a broad range of frequencies .",
    "we then summarize how the single - molecule response from partially aligned molecules is calculated . in sec .",
    "iii the calculated results are presented .",
    "different factors that can influence the precise positions of the hhg minima are examined and reported .",
    "these results show that precise theoretical predictions of the positions of hhg minima in a given experiment is difficult , but the trend ( the direction of the shift of the minimum positions ) can be predicted ( or explained ) .",
    "a short summary at the end concludes this paper .",
    "we first briefly describe the theory of propagation of high harmonics in a macroscopic medium , and in free space , till they reach the detector . to calculate the induced dipole for individual molecules , we include the contributions from multiple molecular orbitals .",
    "our method is based on extending the qrs theory @xcite .",

    ", the change of the hhg spectra is due to the change of mwp which depends on the experimental setup .",
    "the averaged pr transition dipoles of homo and homo-2 are the same in the three calculations .      in wrner _",
    "@xcite , it was found that the minimum in the hhg spectra of aligned co@xmath49 moved to higher photon energy with increasing pump - probe angle @xmath15 , i.e. , the angle between aligning pump beam and the hhg generating probe beam polarizations .",
    "this phenomenon has also been observed in other measurements @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the minimum in the hhg spectra of aligned n@xmath49 has been found to stay at the same position for all pump - probe angles @xcite .",
    "we show the calculated hhg spectra at four pump - probe angles in an 800-nm laser in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) , and in a 1200-nm laser in figs .",
    "[ fig7](b ) and [ fig7](c ) .",
    "laser parameters and experimental arrangements are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the degree of alignment is @xmath58=0.60 .",
    "the hhg spectra for @xmath15=0@xmath5 have been shown in fig .",
    "these figures show that the minimum in the hhg spectra moves to higher photon energies with increasing @xmath15 , and the minimum disappears at large angles . at larger pump - probe angles , contributions from large alignment angles increase .",
    "since homo dominates over homo-2 at large angles in both the ionization rates [ see figs .",
    "[ fig5](c ) and [ fig5](d ) ] and the pr transition dipoles [ see figs .",
    "[ fig7](d)-[fig7](f ) ] , thus hhg at large pump - probe angles has essentially no contributions from homo-2 . also note that at small @xmath15 , the total hhg yield is much smaller @xcite .",
    "in fact , the total hhg spectra for randomly distributed co@xmath0 have little contributions from molecules that are aligned nearly parallel to the polarization axis of the laser .",
    "the hhg spectra of co@xmath0 are complex only in the region where hhg yields are small .",
    "this is generally true ",
    "interpretation of small processes always requires careful and detailed theories .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the multiple orbital contribution to hhg in co@xmath0 with the inclusion of macroscopic propagation effect . in the past few years",
    ", there have been many experimental and theoretical studies on the hhg of co@xmath0 from many laboratories , using lasers with different wavelengths and intensities , for co@xmath0 molecules that are randomly distributed or partially aligned . in particular , for co@xmath0 molecules that are partially aligned along the polarization axis of the probe laser , many experiments have shown that the hhg spectra exhibit minima and the positions of the minima shift with laser intensities @xcite .",
    "the shift of the minimum position with laser intensities has been attributed to the interference between the contributions to hhg from the homo-2 with the one from the homo , despite homo-2 lying at 4.4 ev deeper than the homo . since hhg is a nonlinear process",
    ", these observations posed a great challenge to the theory , especially for the prediction of the position of the minimum and how it changes with the experimental conditions .",
    "since all experimental hhg spectra include macroscopic propagation effect , comparison of theory with experiment is incomplete unless the theory also has included the propagation effect .",
    "our analysis in this paper is based on the macroscopic propagation code extended for aligned molecules , and the recently developed quantitative rescattering theory .",
    "we find that although hhg spectra change significantly under different experimental parameters such as degree of alignment , focussing condition , and the use of a slit , the position of the minimum in the hhg spectra behaves in a similar trend as laser intensity and pump - probe angle vary .",
    "this trend has been found to be consistent with the recent experimental measurements from different groups .",
    "we comment that the present theory and the earlier one by smirnova _",
    "@xcite both explain the intensity dependence of the change of hhg minima , but the details between the two theories are quite different .",
    "the alignment dependence of the ionization rates , the recombination dipole matrix elements and their phases entering the two theories are not the same , for both the homo and homo-2 .",
    "as illustrated in this paper , these parameters can all affect the position of the predicted interference minimum .",
    "furthermore , in smirnova _",
    "_ @xcite the interference is attributed to the importance of hole dynamics in the ion core",
    ". our approach is formulated in the time - independent fashion , no hole dynamics is included . since hhg spectra are taken without explicit observation of electron dynamics , the difference between the two models can not be settled . despite these differences ,",
    "our understanding of the hhg spectra of co@xmath0 has come a long way since 2005 @xcite . with the possibility of including macroscopic propagation effect  routinely \" in the hhg theory for molecular targets , further experimental studies should explore the effects of laser focusing condition and gas pressure , for lasers extending to longer wavelengths .",
    "such studies would further our basic understanding of strong - field physics of molecules to the next level , and eliminate the need of introducing extraneous assumptions in the interpretation of experimental data .",
