    "intrinsic magnetic polarizabilities of natural materials have strong frequency dependence with the fundamental cut - off in ghz range , originating from relatively low spin and orbital susceptibilities  @xcite . recently , effective polarization currents in subwavelength structured loops , organized in ordered arrays , became sources of high - frequency artificial magnetism  @xcite .",
    "nanostructured noble metals , supporting localized plasmon resonances could serve as building blocks for metamaterials with artificial magnetic polarizability  @xcite . however , inherent material losses set severe limitations on performances of such structures  @xcite .",
    "another approach for obtaining magnetic optical response is to employ circular displacement currents in high - index dielectric nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "this is the essence of so - called all - dielectric nanophotonics which opened the way to control magnetic component of light at nanoscale without high - dissipation , inherent for metallic nanostructures  @xcite .",

    "the nanoantenna is excited by a @xmath3-polarized plane wave propagating along @xmath4-axis.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    magnetic response of a dielectric particle strongly depends on it s refractive index , shape , and external environment .",
    "the eigen frequencies of electric and magnetic resonances could span the entire visible range .",
    "however , the value of those multipole moments is limited by dispersion properties of optical materials .    here a new approach for tailoring magnetic response of dielectric nanoparticles via resonant effect of bianisotropy",
    "is proposed .",
    "microscopically , bianisotropy is the effect of magneto - electric coupling , where electric polarization induces magnetic and vice versa .",
    "the signature of this effect appears in the constitutive relations , e.g the dependence of electrical induction also on magnetic field and magnetic induction also on electric field  @xcite .",
    "bianisotropy is used for achieving high values of effective polarizability in metamaterials  @xcite , unique properties of metasurfaces  @xcite , and designed directivity of nanoantennas  @xcite .",
    "previously , it was shown that the interaction of dielectric nanoparticles with substrates may increase induced magnetic moment due to the effect of non - resonant bianisotropy  @xcite .",
    "the approach proposed here is based on electric - magnetic interaction between two resonant nanoparticles of dimer nanoantenna ( see fig .  [ fig_01:geometry ] ) .",
    "the nanoparticles were designed in the following way : the electric dipolar resonance of the bigger sphere overlaps with magnetic response of the smaller one . in this case , the effect of bi - resonance anisotropy is achieved : the resonant electric moment of the bigger nanoparticle induces the additional magnetic moment in the smaller one , tailoring its overall response .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : first , the optical properties of isolated spherical particles are briefly discussed in the context of the resonance tuning .",
    "next , the analytical coupled dipoles formulation of the problem is developed and verified by numerical modeling .",
    "the expression describing the magnetic moment of the nanoparticle , considering the bianisotropy , effect is derived .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that proper geometrical arrangement of the dimer in respect to the incident illumination direction allows achieving additional vectorial component of magnetic polarization .",
    "in order to obtain the dimer design , properties of isolated components will be briefly discussed .",
    "first , isolated silicon sphere of radius @xmath5 nm , having magnetic dipolar resonance at wavelength 477 nm , i.e. in the visible range is considered .",

    "the scattering cross - section of the nanoparticle have been calculated using cst microwave studio , and corresponding results as the function of wavelength are presented in fig .",

    "electric dipolar resonance is blue shifted in respect to the magnetic one and appears on the spectrum at 418 nm wavelength .",
    "this mie resonances hierarchy is red shifted when the radius of nanoparticle is increased .",
    "it is worth noting , that high - order quadrupole resonances , also contributing to the scattering cross - section , are suppressed in this region due to perceptible losses of silicon . the bigger sphere with radius of @xmath6 nm exhibits its electric resonance at the similar spectral position where 52-nm sphere exhibits resonant magnetic response ( fig .

    "the electromagnetic scattering problem could be solved by employing coupled electric and magnetic dipole approximation  @xcite ( cemda ) . in this method ,",
    "complex nanostructures are represented by converging series of point electric and magnetic dipoles  @xcite , while the problem of two spheres could be approximated by only two .",
    "this approximation is particularly accurate , if the gap between the spheres is bigger than their radii  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the subsequent analytical analysis is obtaining a simple formulation , underlining the interference phenomena , affecting the magnetic dipolar polarizability of the smaller particle and revealing the bianisotropic nature of the interaction .",
    "the high - order modes and their interplay have been taken into account using the full - wave numerical calculations using the cst microwave studio . following the cemda method , total electromagnetic fields [ both electric ( @xmath9 ) and magnetic ( @xmath10 ) ] were decomposed into incident and scattered components : @xmath11 where indices @xmath12 denote first ( bigger ) and second ( smaller ) nanoparticles , respectively , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are electric and magnetic fields of the incident plane wave , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the full electric and magnetic fields at the position of the first ( electric ) nanoparticle ( with radius - vector @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electric and magnetic fields scattered by the second ( smaller ) nanoparticle at the first particle center , and analogously for the second particle .",

    "the excitation of an isolated sphere is solely defined by the polarization of the incident wave  for example , linearly polarized beam will excite only one of 3 components of the dipolar mode .",

    "for clear understanding of oscillatory behaviour of the magnetic moments , the simplest model , when the polarizabilities @xmath50 and @xmath51 are supposed to be zero , was considered . in this case",

    "coupled particles approach for controlling magnetic polarizabilities of nanoscale spheres was proposed . while standalone nanoparticles allow obtaining dipolar and high - multipolar resonant responses at the desired wavelength in the visible range specifying their radii and materials , a system of two coupled nanoparticles possesses more degrees of freedom .",
    "altering the radii of both nanoparticles allows to investigate the impact of all the combinations of multipolar coupling effects on the properties of the system .",
    "naturally , the amplitude of the effects is dependent on their mutual displacement , and it decreases at longer distances between the particles , as it was proved both analytically and numerically in the case of dipolar magnetic - electric coupling .",
    "symmetry considerations allow exciting only one dominant induced electric and magnetic moment component when a plane wave is incident upon a single nanoparticle .",
    "it was shown , that for a nanoparticle system , altering the spherical angles and distance between nanoparticles allows to excite all vectorial components of moments simultaneously .",
