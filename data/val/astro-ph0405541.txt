    "the structure of galactic disks is of fundamental importance for observationally addressing the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies . by measuring scalelengths for galaxy samples at different redshifts , it is for example possible to directly address the evolution of galactic disks using the scalelength as a tracer of their sizes ( labb ' e et al .",
    "to a first approximation , the radial light distribution of disks is well described by an exponential decline ( freeman 1970 ) . however , for 25 years ( since van der kruit 1979 ) , we have know that this exponential light distribution does not extend to arbitrarily large radii .",
    "early , deep imaging using photographic plates showed that the disks are radially truncated at the outer parts ( fig.[trunc ] ) . while truncations were difficult to measure at that time  still true today for deriving their exact shapes",
    " it has become progressively easier to detect these _ outer edges _ with modern ccd equipment . in the optical they occur at galactocentric distances of roughly 2 - 6 exponential scalelengths ( next sect . ) .",
    "truncations could be used as an additional , intrinsic parameter measuring the total size of galactic disks ( maybe replacing the widely used , but purely arbitrary @xmath0 definition ) , and truncations may be linked to the formation and evolution of disk galaxies in general . despite the fact that they have been known for so long , we do not have a secure understanding of the origin for these outer edges , so their application as a fundamental disk characteristic is not yet possible . in this overview",
    "we will summarise what is currently known about truncations and describe the quest to unveil their true origin .",
    "to understand their origin and use them as characteristic galaxy parameters ( in comparative studies of different galaxy samples ) , one has to empirically establish _ where _ ` normal disks ' are typically truncated  conventionally expressed in terms of radial scalelength  and _ what _ this truncation looks like .      in their seminal series of papers on the 3-d light distribution in edge - on galaxies ,",
    "van der kruit & searle ( 1981a , 1981b ) measured the ratio of truncation radius ( @xmath1 ) to radial scalelength ( @xmath2 ) as @xmath3 for a sample of seven nearby , large galaxies using photographic plates .",
    "they found that stellar disks have `` rather sharp edges '' , justifying the terms _ cut - off _ and _ truncation _",
    "they used to describe them .",
    "@xcite collected more sensitive ccd images for a much larger sample of 27 edge - on galaxies  later reanalysed and slightly enlarged by @xcite  finding significantly lower ratios of @xmath4 , down to @xmath5 in the latter study .",
    "the groningen group followed with their ccd survey providing a mean ratio of @xmath6 for a pilot sample of four galaxies ( de grijs et al .",
    "this lies in between the former two extremes , but clearly confirms the explicitly larger scatter observed by @xcite compared to @xcite .",
    "since line - of - sight ( los ) integration makes edge - on galaxies ideal candidates to search for truncations , @xcite obtained new data , trying to finally settle the true nature of the truncations by using significantly deeper exposures and selecting objects as undisturbed as possible .",
    "this study showed without doubt that the previously used concept of a sharp truncation does not really hold , as already suggested in @xcite .",
    "it is just possible to fit a sharply truncated model to this new data set ( fig.[trunc]a ) : @xcite derived a value of @xmath7 using 56 galaxies , which is similar to the values of @xmath8 from the full analysis of 20 galaxies from the groningen ccd survey ( kregel et al .",
    "however , it has become clear that the radial profiles are far better described by a _ two - slope _ , or _ broken exponential _",
    "structure , characterised by inner and outer scalelengths and a well - defined break radius .",
    "arcsec ) dominated by the bulge component an inner exponential slope _ ( inner dotted line ) _ is clearly visible out to the break radius at @xmath9 followed by another outer exponential part _ ( outer dotted line)_. [ trunc ] , title=\"fig:\",width=257 ] arcsec ) dominated by the bulge component an inner exponential slope _",
    "( inner dotted line ) _ is clearly visible out to the break radius at @xmath9 followed by another outer exponential part _ ( outer dotted line)_. [ trunc ] , title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]    the deepest data show that los integration ",
    "a fairy godmother for detecting truncations  is at the same time the major drawback in analysing them in detail ( pohlen 2001 ) . since disks are only empirically described by an exponential  typically over at most a few scalelengths  the edge - on geometry of such a two - slope disk , with additional dust obscuring the major axis , complicates an already delicate fitting process .",
    "edge - on , there are always uncertainties in where to mark the break radius ( kregel et al .",
    "2002 ) , and in particular the calculation of the true , unprojected scalelength is heavily model dependent . within a sharply truncated model used by @xcite there is a strong coupling between the two parameters and @xmath2 .",
    "however , fitting an infinite exponential model  excluding the truncation region",
    " does not really solve the problem , especially for galaxies which exhibit an early break ( in terms of scalelength ) and a steep outer decline .",
    "the los integration will distribute the measured light along the assumed uniformly exponential decline so the best determined fitting scalelength will be systematically too small ( pohlen et al .",
    "a simpler approach is that of @xcite , who avoided 3d , los issues by fitting the observed profile with a 1-d , two - slope model , finding @xmath10 from 37 galaxies .",
    "however , the fitted scalelengths in this case are not necessarily the intrinsic scalelengths , both because dust extinction increases the measured scalelength and because the scalelength of a 1d fit is larger than the intrinsic scalelength by as much as 20% ( e.g. , de grijs 1997 ) .",
    "the only way to settle the question of where the breaks in the radial profiles really occur is to go back to face - on galaxies as done earlier by @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xcite took deep , carefully flatfielded exposures of three face - on galaxies .",
    "the face - on geometry is practically independent of possible los effects caused by an integration across the multicomponent disk and much less affected by dust .",
    "these data quantitatively establish the smooth truncation behaviour of the radial surface brightness profiles , which is best described by a two - slope or broken exponential model , characterised by inner and outer exponential scalelengths separated at a relatively well defined break radius ( fig.[trunc]b ) .",
    "the mean value for the distance independent ratio of break radius to inner scalelength  which marks the start of the truncation region  is @xmath11 for the three galaxies .",
    "this value is significantly larger than the value for the edge - on sample , but this is expected given the systematic errors in the scalelength measurement in the edge - on case described above .",
    "it is slightly lower compared to @xmath12 for the 16 face - on galaxies obtained by @xcite .",
    "this small shift could be due to the different methods used to derive the truncation  only estimated from isophote maps by @xcite  or the sample sizes and selections .      in summary ,",
    "the radial profiles show a two - slope or broken exponential behaviour with an inner and outer disk separated by a rather sharp break radius at @xmath13 , taking the mean value from the three face - on galaxies of @xcite and the scatter from the larger edge - on sample of @xcite .",
    "however , it is clear that truncations  seen in different data sets , using different methods , and analysed by different groups  are _ real _ , in contrast to the recent claim of @xcite .",
    "it is not a matter of `` questioning their very existence '' , but rather of determining the shape of the profiles beyond the break radius , which is admittedly still difficult to measure and a `` puzzle '' to explain .",
    "the data of pohlen ( 2001 ) suggest that a very high fraction more than 79% of mostly late - type edge - on disks are truncated .",
    "the remaining galaxies are either still disturbed ( despite the careful selection ) , show an additional major structure not accounted for in a single component disk  such as outer envelopes or a strong bar  , or ( in one case ) have s / n that is too low .",
    "@xcite ( see also kregel 2003 ) support a rather high frequency of radial truncation features for a similar late - type sample of 34 edge - on galaxies .",
    "they find successful truncation fits for 20 galaxies ( 59% ) , whereas most of the other galaxies are rejected for technical reasons such as superimposed foreground stars or low s / n .",
    "the latter is the main problem of this sample in respect to truncations yielding only lower limits of typically @xmath14 for the other galaxies and just two cases of @xmath15 .",
    "just recently @xcite , analysing a large sample of intermediately inclined , early - type galaxies , found seven barred galaxies without measured truncations beyond six scalelengths .",
    "although the edge - on samples certainly also contain barred galaxies , we may ask if only barred galaxies ( sometimes ) lack truncations .",
    "it is true that the detailed studies by @xcite and @xcite , which showed disks without truncation extending to at least seven and ten scalelengths , respectively , dealt with two strongly barred face - on galaxies .",
    "but the large collection of surface brightness profiles for unbarred or only weakly barred sb  sc galaxies by courteau ( 1996 ) shows several cases of profiles which extend to at least six scalelengths without truncation , and the sample of @xcite also includes one unbarred sa galaxy ( ugc 3580 ) with @xmath16 .",
    "it is still puzzling why the large edge - on samples  which have the advantage of los integration  are missing many of the `` untruncated '' galaxies ( or galaxies with truncations beyond six scalelengths ) seen in face - on samples .",
    "from the few late - type , face - ons in @xcite and the large collection of early - type , face - ons in @xcite we know that azimuthal averaging does not play a significant role in smoothing out truncations . if untruncated disks really do exist , then models which attempt to explain truncations also need to explain why some disks are _ not _ truncated",
    "despite the recent success in disentangling where the disks are truly truncated , the nature of galactic disk truncations is far from understood and their place in theories of disk galaxy formation is still under debate .",
    "the proposed hypotheses span a rather wide range of possibilities , though there are clearly two favoured explanation : the _ collapse model _ and the _ threshold model_. van der kruit ( 1987 ) deduced a direct connection to the galaxy formation process describing the truncations as remnants from the early collapse .",
    "the truncation reflects here the maximum angular momentum of the protogalaxy , which is completely independent of the hierarchical merging history . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite following toomre ( 1964 ) has suggested a dynamical critical star - formation threshold ( @xmath17 ) ",
    "recently addressed in a different version by @xcite  for thin , rotating , isothermal gas disks . if this persists over sufficient time it should produce a visible turnover or truncation in the observed stellar luminosity profile at that radius . here",
    "the truncation radius corresponds to the radial position where @xmath18 .",
    "more recently , @xcite combined the collapse and threshold models . while there is a truncation of the cold gas which reflects the maximum specific angular momentum of the baryonic mass that has cooled ,",
    "the truncation radius of the _ stars _ reflects the presence of a star - formation threshold .",
    "alternatively , @xcite and @xcite have presented evolutionary scenarios  typified as viscous evolution models  which show features surprisingly comparable to the observed two - slope structure . however , according to @xcite the breaks just reflect the initial conditions in the gas and tend to be smeared out while the galaxy evolves with time .",
    "@xcite have proposed a connection with large scale galactic magnetic fields .",
    "this approach seems controversial , since it also explains flat rotation curves without dark matter ; nevertheless , it is able to explain possible @xmath4 variations with morphological type or rotational velocity .",
    "the formation of a truncated stellar disk by tidal interaction , although appealing , is in contradiction to the radial spreading shown by @xcite in their numerical n - body simulations of satellite mergers .",
    "however , we are still missing an up - to - date n - body+sph _ ( stars and gas ) _ simulation addressing a possible connection between truncations and interaction .",
    "the star - formation threshold models of @xcite and @xcite both predict a correlation of the ratio @xmath4 with the central surface brightness .",
    "low - surface brightness galaxies should have lower values , as indeed indicated by current observations ( fig.[rtrdhvmu]a or kregel 2003 ) .",
    "the collapse model does not account for such a correlation since it predicts instead a fixed value for all galaxies , allowing for only very small scatter .",
    "according to the threshold models a similar trend should be observed in relation to the mass of the galaxy .",
    "low - mass systems ( characterised by smaller rotational velocities ) should have smaller values for the ratio of truncation radius to radial scalelength , as indicated by @xcite ( fig.[rtrdhvmu]b ) .",
    "additional support for a correlation with mass comes from recent work on nearby dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all find similar two - slope profiles with rather low values for @xmath19 .",
    "the currently available large edge - on samples do not sufficiently cover the hubble sequence to address the prediction by @xcite that early - type , bulge dominated galaxies ( sa to s0 ) should have @xmath20 .",
    "however , in the large sample of moderately inclined , early - type , barred galaxies of @xcite , most galaxies do not follow this relation .",
    "only a small subset does , but these truncations are far better described as bar - related olr breaks ( sect.[bars ] ) .",
    "this failure of the promising threshold model of @xcite could be due to its rather general implementation of the bulge formation process .",
    "@xcite ( see also martin & kennicutt 2001 ) , measuring radial distributions , observed that the star - formation rate drops abruptly at a finite radius .",
    "unfortunately only a few galaxies with both and optical breaks are currently available for testing the one - to - one correlation expected in a simple threshold scenario .",
    "current data does indicate such a correlation ( fig.[sfobs]a or hunter 2002 ) , while beyond the break the decline in the luminosity seems to be more rapid than the stellar one .    .",

    "[ rtrdhvmu ] , title=\"fig:\",width=257 ]    we know that disk galaxies have radial colour gradients : the disk gets bluer towards the edge ( de jong 1996 ) .",
    "this implies that disks get radially younger  arguing for an inside - out formation scenario  in the sense that their inner regions are older and more metal rich than their outer regions ( bell & de jong 2000 ) .",
    "however , this does not explain the truncation radius as the radius to which the disk has now grown ( larson 1976 ) , since the stars beyond the break are indeed younger but still many gyrs old .",
    "this is confirmed by @xcite , who studied the resolved stellar populations of ngc2403 and found that while young stars are restricted to the inner parts , agb stars observed in the outer parts suggested that star - formation has occurred there during intermediate epochs of 1gyr or more . the measured b- and r - band profiles of the face - on galaxy ngc5923  which trace the combined star - formation history ",
    "indicate that the radial blueing extends only out to the optical break , which is at the same radius in both bands ( fig.[sfobs]b ) . outside the break the outer disk",
    "has a constant blue colour @xmath22 , which argues for either a single population or a coherent star - formation history .",
    "nir data may help to determine the question if the old stellar population  tracing the mass of the galaxy  changes across the break .",
    "data by @xcite show for the first time that truncations are also present in nir images and that they are rather sharp .",

    "many barred galaxies possess rings in their outer disk produced by the bar s outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) .",
    "while some of these rings are seen in radial profiles as mere bumps on an underlying exponential disk , @xcite found that a large fraction of their barred , early - type galaxies exhibit breaks associated with the olr .",
    "many of these _ olr breaks _ resemble the classical truncations described above , but located further inside .",
    "this implies that the bar is able to re - shape the initial gas disk ( maybe replenished by later infall ) out to substantial radii ( @xmath23 ) . without additional data it is not yet clear if these olr breaks also occur in more late - type galaxies  known to have smaller and weaker bars  thus providing a true alternative to the now favoured threshold theory ( erwin et al .",
    "however , the three clearly unbarred face - on sbc  sc galaxies of @xcite argue against olr breaks as the sole explanation for truncations , if one does not assume that these galaxies once had bars which are now dissolved .",
    "the intriguing existence of barred but untruncated galaxies ( sect.[untruncated ] ) implies that bars may also _ prevent _ truncations in some cases .",
    "the smooth nature of truncations clearly shows that there are stars outside the break radius .",
    "while the previously considered sharp truncations would agree nicely with the threshold model , a simple critical density does _ not _ account for the observed two - slope structure .",
    "there are two possible explanations for these stars beyond the break radius",
    ". they could be either born in situ  out of an initial , maybe viscously redistributed , and already replenished gas disk  or they are stars from the inner disk which have migrated outwards in a kind of diffusion process .",
    "@xcite already showed for a couple of galaxies that there is local star - formation at large galactocentric distances , probably beyond a break radius , supporting the former possibility .",
    "however , both approaches still have to explain _ why _ the inner and outer disk regions are produced with different , yet still exponential , slopes , _ why _ the transition zone appears to be rather sharp , and  even more challenging  _ why _ the outer disk is so large : @xcite showed for the face - on galaxies that the break radius is at @xmath24 using the last measured point ( @xmath25 ) as a reference . in the case of the milky - way ( @xmath26 kpc )",
    "this implies an inner disk of 14kpc and an outer disk of at least 7kpc extra radius ! this is significantly larger than the usually assumed values of @xmath27kpc previously deduced for a sharp truncation .",
    "according to prez - martin ( this volume ) there seems to be a trend of galaxies being truncated earlier ( in terms of @xmath2 ) at higher redshift ( consistent with tamm & tenjes 2003 ) .",
    "so far , none of the described models has addressed such an interesting evolution with redshift .",
    "finally , we want to emphasise that the observed radial profiles show rather sharp break radii",
    ". however , they are not sharply truncated  in the sense of an outer radius beyond which no further stars can be found  as is often assumed in the literature . despite the success of recent studies of the structural parameters , a medium - deep survey of a well selected sample of local , intermediate inclination to face - on disk galaxies along the hubble sequence is still necessary , to provide ultimately _ the reference value _ of @xmath4 .",
    "the star - formation threshold model seems to be the most promising hypothesis to explain the presence of truncations so far . although less direct than the collapse model  which directly relates observed truncations to initial conditions  van den bosch s ( 2001 ) model showed how to implement such a star - formation threshold in a collapse model which is able to trace the evolutionary picture .",
    "we are still working on additional observational support , such as more -to - optical break comparisons , detailed measurements of the atomic and molecular gas densities out to the break radius , and measurements of the stellar kinematics and population differences inside and outside the break .",
