    "it is the current paradigm that the fundamental power source of all active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is accretion onto a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) ( see and ) . for many years",
    ", theorists and observers have attempted to prove the existence of smbhs , inferring their presence by studying how they affect the surrounding environment ( and review the smbh search ) .",
    "a variety of techniques and arguments has been developed to estimate the mass of the central engine in agn @xcite .",
    "this has included both theoretical and observational methods such as : fitting the spectra of accretion discs ; high efficiency and eddington limit arguments ; stellar dynamical searches ; kinematics of radio masers ; x - ray variability and virial masses from optical variability , which includes reverberation mapping and photoionization model techniques .    in this paper",
    "we propose the use of warm absorbers ( was ) to determine an upper limit to the bh mass .",
    "was are significant quantities of partially - ionized , optically - thin material found mainly in the vicinity of type 1 seyfert galaxies .",
    "this gas is most readily observable when it lies along line - of - sight to the central x - ray source : the observed x - ray spectrum then displays well - defined k - shell absorption edges .",
    "was the first to postulate the presence of such material based on the unusual x - ray spectrum of the qso mr 2251 - 178 from the _ einstein _ observatory .",
    "the clearest demonstration of the presence of warm absorbing material comes from spectroscopic observations of the ovii and oviii k - shell absorption edges at 0.74 and 0.87 , respectively .",
    "these edges were first found by the _ rosat _",
    "pspc @xcite .",
    "the spectral capabilities of _ asca _ allowed for detailed studies of such edges ( e.g. , , , , , and ) . was are common , being detected in half of the sources ( , ) .",
    "several different models have been suggested concerning the nature and location of the wa . among others ,",
    "these include the very detailed studies by and .",
    "the reason for the large variety of models is that not all physical properties of the wa can be directly determined from x - ray spectral fits , but only certain combinations of them .",
    "in addition to the was , associated uv and optical absorption features are also typically found in agn spectra ( see and references therein for an overview ) .",
    "a common property shared by almost all associated absorption features is that any velocity shift is always to the _ blue _ of the systemic velocity , implying that the absorbing material is outflowing",
    ". found a one - to - one correspondence between those objects showing uv absorption and those presenting x - ray was .",
    "this implies the two phenomena are likely to be physically related .",
    "however , since was generally reveal higher ionization states , and higher column densities , they can not be the same in general .",
    "a very plausible connection is a dynamical one in which both uv absorbers and x - ray was are outflowing .",
    "the blue - shifts in x - ray absorption lines have recently been revealed by _",
    "observations ( e.g. , , ) , presenting typical velocities of several hundred to several thousand .",
    "one unresolved issue is whether the outflowing gas is smoothly distributed ( i.e. winds ) or resides in discrete clouds .",
    "show that the warm absorption seen in many x - ray spectra of agn may be produced by x - ray heated winds .",
    "also sketch some ideas relating the wa to a radiatively driven outflow .",
    "in contrast to the wind model , show that accelerations to velocities of a few hundred to a few thousand is a natural consequence of the agn environment when radiation pressure acts on external pressure - confined highly ionized clouds ( responsible for the wa features ) . for the present study",
    ", we will adopt the latter model in which wa clouds are radiatively accelerated by the central ionizing continuum .",
    "this work describes a new method for obtaining an upper limit on an agn bh mass , by means of a comparison between the radiative and gravitational forces acting on its wa clouds .",
    "section 2 presents the 30 observations of the 6 agns sample to which our technique has been applied .",
    "the description of our method , a spectral analysis of the _ asca _ data and the results and comparison with other bh mass estimates by different techniques are addressed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 and 5 analyse the influence of the underlying continuum on our estimate and further terms in the equation of motion , respectively . finally , in section 6 our conclusions are summarized . throughout this paper ,",

    "we have studied a sample of six agns consisting of five seyfert 1 galaxies ( ic 4329a , mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 , ngc 3516 , ngc 4051 and ngc 5548 ) and one radio - quiet quasar ( mr 2251 - 178 ) , which cover a range of almost 4 orders of magnitude in x - ray luminosity .",
    "these objects are a subsample of those presenting warm absorption features in the 24 type 1 agn sample of reynolds ( 1997 ) . with the exception of mr 2251 - 178 , the other five seyfert galaxies are also present in the survey",
    ". the was of all these sources have a very rich observational history @xcite and their host agns are amongst the brightest ones in the nearby universe ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "the spectral files have been downloaded from the tartarus database ( http://tartarus.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ) and the 30 observations analysed are listed in table 1 .",
    "the following assumptions have been made :    * the wa , responsible for the absorption features around 1 , is present in the form of clouds . *",
    "these clouds are pushed radiatively outwards .",
    "* the clouds motion is entirely radial .",
    "the radial equation of motion for these wa clouds is @xmath9 where : @xmath10 is the cross - section presented by the wa clouds ; @xmath11 is the luminosity absorbed by the wa cloud ; @xmath12 is the distance from the ionizing source to the wa cloud ; @xmath13 is the velocity of light ; @xmath14 is the gravitational constant ; @xmath15 is the black hole mass ; @xmath16 is the mass of a wa cloud ; @xmath17 is the density of the medium through which the wa is moving ; @xmath18 is the velocity of the wa clouds with respect to that medium and @xmath19 is the acceleration experienced by the wa cloud .",
    "the first term on the left hand side is the outward force due to radiation pressure , the second term is the restoring force due to gravity , and the third term describes any drag force ( i.e. ram pressure ) experienced by the wa when moving through an intercloud medium . if the drag force and the acceleration term are negligible , a comparison between the radiation and gravitation terms leads to an expression for the bh mass : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the proton rest - mass and @xmath22 is the column density of the wa clouds . if these terms are non negligible and positive , then the above expression becomes an upper limit for @xmath23 .",
    "we shall treat it as such in the rest of the paper and discuss further the drag and acceleration terms in section 5 .",
    "the only two unknowns in eqn .",
    "2 are @xmath24 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath22 is calculated as a parameter in our spectral fits of a single ionization parameter model presented in the following subsection . as already seen in and",
    ", the data can often be well fit by such a model which allows for accurate estimates of the ionization parameter and column densities .",
    "the calculation of @xmath25 has been performed using the fact that the photoionized plasma causing the edges is optically thin along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , the expression for the radiation pressure , @xmath26 , can be written as @xmath27 where : @xmath28 is the luminosity per unit frequency from the ionizing source ( which we assume to be a power law of photon index @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 is the luminosity per unit frequency observed after @xmath28 has passed through the wa cloud .",
    "the photoionization models can predict both the intensity of the incident and transmitted continuum allowing the calculation of the above integral ( see section 3.2.3 ) . we have chosen the limits of our integration to be : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the data have been fitted using two different models .",
    "the aim for this multiple analysis has been firstly , to determine phenomenologically the underlying continuum by mimicking the wa features by the two photoionization absorption edges at the ovii and oviii rest - frame energies ( sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 ) ; and then to calculate the radiation pressure acting on the wa ( section 3.2.3 ) .",
    "data from all four instruments were fitted simultaneously .",
    "sis data between 0.54.0 and gis data between 0.84.0 were used .",
    "the spectra were then fitted using the standard @xmath33 minimization technique implemented in version 11.0.1 of the xspec spectral fitting package @xcite .      in order to determine the underlying continuum hidden by various spectral features displayed by the data ,",
    "the spectrum of each object was fitted by a spectral model consisting of the following components :    * a power - law representing the primary continuum ( photon index @xmath29 ) * two absorption edges with rest - frame threshold energies of 0.74 and 0.87 representing ovii and oviii k - shell absorption ( with maximum optical depths @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) respectively .",
    "these two edges provide , to a good approximation , a description of the effects of the warm absorber over the asca band . * intrinsic absorption by a column density @xmath36 of neutral matter in the rest frame of the source .",
    "this absorbing material is assumed to have cosmic abundances . *",
    "galactic absorption ( at @xmath37 ) fixed at the level determined by the hi 21-cm measurements reported in table 1 , column 4 .",
    "free parameters in the fit were @xmath29 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the normalizations of the model for each of the four instruments were also left as free parameters .",
    "this allows for the known @xmath38@xmath39 per cent discrepancies between the normalizations of different instruments ( see http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/asca/watchout.html for a discussion of the decrease in efficiency of sis0 and sis1 below 1 since approximately late 1994 ) .",
    "table 2 presents a summary of the @xmath33 fitting .    as noted in reynolds ( 1997 ) ,",
    "fixing the energies of the two absorption edges at the physical rest - frame energies of the k - shell absorption edges of ovii and oviii , is the most robust to the various unmodeled spectral complexities such as recombination line / continuum emission , resonance absorption lines and other absorption edges .",
    "these complexities would require many additional degrees of freedom to model ( such as the covering fraction of the warm material , its density , the chemical abundances and the velocity structure ) and would lead to an over modeling of the data for all but the very highest quality data . in fitting a simple two - edge model , these complexities could lead to false shifts in the threshold edge of the edges ( e.g. the existence of the ne ix edge may falsely imply a small blueshift of the oviii edge when a two - edge model is fitted with the edge threshold energies as free parameters ) .",

    "the ic medium could have a very significant effect on the dynamics of the clouds through its drag and the resulting hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "whether the wa clouds can move relative to a ic medium without suffering gravitational , tidal , shear , or rayleigh - taylor instabilities is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we assume that magnetic fields internal to the clouds must be important .",
    "first we note that ignoring the drag force justifies hving chosen our estimates as upper limits .",
    "if the density of this external gas is large enough then the wa would be subject to a drag force that would cause us to overestimate the strength of gravity in the dynamics of the wa .",
    "the upper - limit of the black hole mass is found by assuming that the radiation force on the wa , @xmath432 , is larger than the gravitational restoring force , @xmath433 .",
    "therefore , the drag force will be important if it is comparable to @xmath432 : @xmath434 the density of the ic medium at which drag will be important can then be related to the velocity of the wa through the medium ( which we take to be the observed radial velocity ) : @xmath435 where @xmath436 is the mean mass of particles in the intercloud medium ( assumed to be a pure hydrogen and helium mixture ) . making use of the average @xmath24 for each object , we plot in figure 6 this critical density as a function of the outflowing velocity of the wa .",
    "a distance of @xmath324  cm was assumed , and the range in @xmath18 was chosen to cover the range that is typically observed in was .",
    "if the density of the ic medium is below the line then drag is not important ; alternatively , drag will be important if the ic density lies above the line . for typical values of the observed wa blueshift",
    ", an ic density @xmath437 seems to be required for drag to be important in any of the objects .",
    "the most direct limits of the gas come from opacity arguments ( i.e. the absence of soft x - ray absorption ) .",
    "we shall note at this stage that a medium with a density of @xmath414 and a pathlength of @xmath438 has a thomson depth of nearly 0.1 .",
    "another constraint on the properties of the ic medium is that its column density has to be smaller than that of the wa , @xmath22 ; otherwise the ic medium could be identified with the wa itself .",
    "the acceleration term has to be positive for our estimates to stand up as upper limits for the bh mass , and not lower limits as it would be for the case of negative acceleration , or just measurements of the bh mass for the case of zero acceleration .",
    "the dynamics of wa clouds in pressure equilibrium with external magnetic pressure are studied by .",
    "their principal conclusion is that such clouds can be accelerated to high velocities by means of radiation pressure acceleration .",
    "the velocity profiles for two generic cases of clouds ( shell - like clouds with constant mass and constant density clouds ) are presented in their figure 10 . for most external pressure profiles ,",
    "the acceleration results are positive for typical values of wa velocities .",
    "still for some cases a negative acceleration can be possible .",
    "finally we would like to mention that for the wa temperature ( around around @xmath439 ) , the plasma would be highly supersonic .",
    "therefore , pressure forces would not be relevant for the velocities considered ( e.g. several hundred kilometers per second ) .",
    "in this paper we present a new method for obtaining an upper limit on an agn bh mass by means of the comparison between the radiative and gravitational forces acting on its wa . for that , we have adopted a cloud model for the wa in which the radiation pressure dominates the dynamics of such clouds .",
    "no further assumptions regarding the geometry , location and nature of the wa are necessary .",
    "this method has been applied to five seyfert 1 galaxies ( ic 4329a , mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 , ngc 3516 , ngc 4051 and ngc 5548 ) and one radio - quiet quasar ( mr 2251 - 178 ) , which cover a range of almost 4 orders of magnitude in x - ray luminosity .",
    "the calculation of the upper limit of the bh mass required the determination of only two quantities : the luminosity absorbed by the wa cloud , @xmath24 , and the column density of the wa , @xmath440 .",
    "both of them are obtained when the soft x - ray data is fitted to our single zone photoionization models for the wa . despite the simplicity of our method , our estimates for the upper limit of the bh mass fall within one order of magnitude of other independent methods results ( see fig .",
    "the only requirement of our technique is the presence of outflowing ( i.e. blueshifted ) material which kinematics is dominated by radiation pressure .",
    "uv absorbers could be used to determine the agn bh mass using the same method .",
    "narrow uv absorption features are shown in many type 1 agn and in most cases they appear blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity .",
    "their typical velocities are @xmath333 1000 .",
    "one uncertainty in our method is the presence of other non - radial forces that affect the dynamic of the wa , and therefore change its radial equation of motion ( e.g. centrifugal or magnetic forces ) .",
    "further studies of the wa dynamics could possibly provide more information on which forces are acting and therefore constrain more tightly the determination of the bh mass .",
    "also if the mass is well - determined by some other means , application of our method can lead to information on the drag and acceleration forces acting on the wa .",
    "metallicities different than solar would have an effect on our estimates . given that @xmath441 where @xmath442 is the metallicity of the warm absorber ,",
    "then solar and supersolar abundances maintain our estimates as upper limits .",
    "it would be only in the case of subsolar abundances when our upper limit could be lower than the real value of the black hole mass .",
    "note again that if the black hole mass can be accurately determined , our method could be used to study the metallicity of the warm absorber .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the calculation of the absorbed luminosity , @xmath24 , we have used the fact that the wa is optically thin material .",
    "this holds for the data used in this paper ( more considerations on the determination of @xmath24 would be required if we were to work with higher resolution data ) .",
    "also better quality data would lead to a more accurate determination on the errors of our upper limits .",
    "one of the main goals of agn studies is to measure the bh mass and a myriad of techniques has been explored over the last two decades .",
    "the use of was as vehicles to determine the agn bh mass reinforces the smbh paradigm and opens up a powerful and simple technique for measuring agn bh masses .",
    "d.r . ballantyne contributed with very useful discussions and careful reading of the manuscript .",
    "we want to thank gary ferland for providing cloudy and co - workers of p. magdziarz for providing the continuum in their paper .",
    "this work has been supported by pparc and trinity college ( r.m . ) and by the royal society ( a.c.f . ) .",
