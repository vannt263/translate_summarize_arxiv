    "the hypertriton is a bound state consisting of a proton , a neutron , and a @xmath2 hyperon .",
    "although a hypertriton consisting of a proton , a neutron , and a @xmath3 hyperon could exist , no experimental information is available at present @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will use the term `` hypertriton '' to denote the @xmath2-hypertriton in the following .",
    "interest in the hypertriton is mainly due to the fact that it is the lightest and the loosely bound hypernucleus .",
    "the separation energy into a @xmath2 and a deuteron is only @xmath4 mev  @xcite , while the total binding energy is 2.35 mev .",
    "being the lightest hypernucleus , the hypertriton is obviously the first system in which the @xmath5 potential , including the interesting @xmath2-@xmath6 conversion , can be tested in the nuclear medium .",
    "this is also supported by the fact that neither the @xmath7 nor the @xmath8 interactions possesses sufficient strength to produce a bound two - body system , while on the other hand the available @xmath5 scattering data are still extremely poor .",
    "therefore the hypertriton is expected to play an important role in hypernuclear physics similar to that of the deuteron in conventional nuclear physics . due to experimental difficulties ,",
    "however , the existing information on the hypertriton is mostly from old measurements @xcite .    recently ,",
    "theoretical investigation of the hypertriton properties have drawn considerable attentions in the nuclear physics community  @xcite .",
    "the bochum group  @xcite has investigated the hypertriton by using various @xmath5 and @xmath9 potentials .",
    "interestingly , when the jlich hyperon - nucleon potential in the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) parameterization ( model @xmath10 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) combined with various realistic @xmath9 interactions were used , then the hypertriton turned out to be unbound . only an increase by about 4% in the jlich potential can bring the hypertriton back to a bound state",
    ". however , the use of the nijmegen hyperon - nucleon potential in the same calculation  @xcite leads to a bound hypertriton .",
    "this fact indicates that significant improvement in the hyperon - nucleon force sector is strongly needed .    in principle",
    ", the hypertriton could be produced by employing hadronic properties such as stopped and low momentum kaon induced reactions , a@xmath11b and a@xmath12b .",
    "another possibility to obtain hypertriton is by utilizing the proton - deuteron collision @xmath13 komarov _",
    "et al_. have studied this process theoretically at incident proton energies @xmath14 gev and found that the cross section is on the order of 1 nb , at most  @xcite .",
    "this result has been refined in ref .",
    "@xcite by using a two - step model and the differential cross section is found to be much smaller than 1 nb / sr .    because the electromagnetic beams ( electrons or real photons ) are well understood , clean , and well under control , the use of the electromagnetic processes has , however , a competing advantage compared to the hadronic ones .",
    "more than one decade ago one of the authors has estimated the cross section of the hypertriton photoproduction @xmath15 and investigated the effects of the off - shell assumption and fermi motion on this process  @xcite .",
    "this has been performed by using the wave function of @xmath0he obtained as a solution of the faddeev equations with the reid soft core potential @xcite , and a simple hypertriton wave function developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , along with the elementary operator from williams _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the result showed that the cross sections are predicted to be on the order of 1 nb and drop quickly as a function of the kaon scattering angle .",
    "eight years later three experimental data points on the hypertriton electroproduction @xmath16 at @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , were published by dohrmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "although this process utilizes electrons ( virtual photons ) , and therefore is different from the process given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyp_photo ] ) , the result shows a surprising phenomenon , i.e. , the angular distribution of the differential cross section shows an almost flat structure .",
    "an extrapolation of the photoproduction result to the finite @xmath19 region is only able to reproduce the trend of the first two data points and , on the other hand , underpredicts the last data point by one order of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to the process @xmath20 reported by the same experiment  @xcite , for which the cross section decreases smoothly and nicely fits the prediction  @xcite .",
    "the present work has been greatly motivated by the facts described above . in the present work",
    "we shall only focus on the photo- and electroproduction of the hypertriton and leave the electroproduction of @xmath21 for the future consideration . for this purpose we shall use the modern nuclear wave functions  @xcite as well as the frequently used elementary operator kaon - maid  @xcite to study the effects of the various off - shell assumptions , fermi motion , and coulomb interaction between the exited kaon and the hypertriton , on the calculated differential cross sections .",
    "recently , this elementary operator has been used to investigate the final states @xmath5 and @xmath22 interactions in kaon photoproduction off a deuteron as well as to investigate the possibility of extracting the elementary process @xmath23 from this process at the quasi - free - scattering kinematics  @xcite .",
    "the elementary operator is given in a unique form that is completely frame independent , since it can be expressed in terms of the mandelstam variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , or the four - momenta of the photon , nucleon , kaon , and hyperon .",
    "furthermore , the operator does not contain the photon - polarization - vector @xmath27 and spin - operator @xmath28 terms .",
    "this guarantees the analytical continuation of the elementary amplitude and enables us to use different off - shell assumptions .",
    "thus , the result would provide us with a refined calculation of the hypertriton photoproduction and a direct comparison with the electroproduction data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : elementary ] we shall briefly review the properties of the elementary operator used in this work .",

    "a few important notes on the elementary amplitudes , the anti - symmetry factor of the nuclear wave functions , and some kinematical relations are given in the appendices .",
    "since photoproduction is only a special case of electroproduction , we will only consider the latter in our formalism .",
    "the results for photoproduction are obtained by setting the virtual photon momentum to zero .",
    "the elementary process for electroproduction of a kaon and a hyperon on the nucleon target can be written as @xmath29 to describe this process we make use of an isobar model , because by utilizing this model the elementary amplitudes can be written in term of a frame independent operator which is required to include the fermi motion in the nucleus .",

    "the effects of different off - shell assumptions are also found to be more considerable in electroproduction , especially in the transverse cross section .",
    "motivated by these observations , here we continue our investigation described in subsection  [ sub_result_photo ] to the finite @xmath19 regions .    the result for hypertriton electroproduction shows , however , different behavior compared to the case of pion electroproduction of @xmath0he",
    "this is demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : k2vsth_full ] , where we can see that the effect of the higher partial waves is considerably smaller than in the case of photoproduction ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : varwave ] ) . only at higher @xmath140 and very forward directions , where the momentum transfer @xmath141 is significantly large , the effects are sizable . note that the electroproduction cross sections exhibit quite different shapes compared to the photoproduction ones .",
    "this indicates that the longitudinal terms dominate other contributions in all three kinematics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : k2vsth_full ] .",
    "this conjecture is proven by fig .",
    "[ fig : cross_all ] , from which it is obvious that the fall - off structure of the longitudinal cross sections drives the whole shapes of the cross section shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : k2vsth_full ] , whereas the behavior of the transverse cross sections ( with peaks at @xmath130 ) is similar to that of the photoproduction cross sections given in fig .",
    "[ fig : varwave ] .    we have found that the dominant behavior of the longitudinal cross sections originate from the missing resonance @xmath1 . excluding this resonance results in a reduction of the longitudinal cross sections by one order of magnitude , whereas the transverse ones decreases only by a factor of two .",
    "this result indicates that the behavior of the longitudinal terms in the elementary operator ( see fig .  [ fig : elementary_q2 ] ) is persistent and even gets amplified in the nuclear cross sections .",
    "the @xmath19 evolutions of both transverse and longitudinal cross sections are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : k2_profile ] . both figs .",
    "[ fig : cross_all ] and [ fig : k2_profile ] reveals the different behaviors of the longitudinal and transverse ( along with other ) cross sections at the forward direction and at @xmath142 .",
    "the result demonstrates the possibility to isolate the longitudinal cross section from other contributions by measuring the process at forward directions .",
    "on the other hand , measurements at @xmath142 ( with averaged @xmath143 ) can give us the transverse cross section .",
    "off - shell effects are also found to be important in the case of electroproduction .",
    "this fact is clearly exhibited in fig .  [",
    "fig : k2_off ] , where we can see that the `` final hyperon on - shell '' assumption can nicely shift the cross section upward to reproduce the experimental data at @xmath144 and @xmath145 . obviously , this finding is in contrast to the phenomenon observed in the pion photoproduction off @xmath0he  @xcite , where the assumption that the initial nucleon is on - shell yields a better agreement with experimental data .",
    "however , the present finding can be understood as follows : the hyperon binding energy in the hypertriton is much weaker than the binding energy of the nucleon in the @xmath0he .",
    "therefore , shifting the hyperon in the final state closer to its mass - shell moves the model closer to reality .",
    "the experimental data point at @xmath146 seems , however , to be very difficult to reproduce .",
    "although the elementary cross section at this kinematics slightly increases , the nuclear suppression from the two nuclear wave functions is sufficiently strong to reduce the cross sections at @xmath147 .    at @xmath148 gev and",
    "@xmath149 gev the various off - shell assumptions yield quite different phenomena compared to those in the case of photoproduction ( compare the two lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : k2_off ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : offshell ] ) . in the case of photoproduction",
    "the assumption that the final hyperon is on - shell yields the smallest cross sections , whereas the situation is opposite in the case of electroproduction .",
    "again , this behavior originates from the longitudinal terms . as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : offshell_el ] , for all @xmath140 shown , the longitudinal cross sections are larger than the transverse ones . in the former ,",
    "the off - shell effects are more profound and the assumption that the hyperon in the final state is on - shell always yields the largest cross section . such behavior does not show up in the transverse cross sections .",
    "in fact , by comparing the transverse cross sections shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : offshell_el ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig : offshell ] we can clearly see that the result presented here is still consistent with that of the photoproduction .    we have also found that although the phenomenon of the dominant longitudinal cross sections originates from the contribution of the missing resonance @xmath1 , the fact that the final - hyperon - on - shell assumption always yields the largest cross section is not affected by the omission of this resonance .",
    "the massive numerical integrations in the full calculation using all partial waves described above requires special attention in the future .",
    "one way to reduce this task is by limiting the number of the involved elementary amplitudes @xmath150 given in appendix  [ amplitudes_fi ] .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that to a good approximation the `` big - big parts '' of the dirac spinors ( in our case , the @xmath151 ",
    "@xmath152 ) of a special isobar model can be safely neglected . however , the discrepancies between the full calculation and this approximation depends critically on both photon and nucleon energies ( see , for instance , fig .  2 of ref .",
    "thus , careful inspections in a wide range of kinematics should be previously performed , before we can apply this approximation in the hypertriton production .",
    "another method which might be of interest is by limiting the number of the partial waves used in the calculation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : varwave ] , the discrepancy between the results of the full calculation and the @xmath24-wave approximation can reach about 10% .",
    "therefore , the use of only @xmath24-wave would not be recommended for a precise calculation .",
    "however , the ultimate question is : what is the minimum value of @xmath153 , for which we would obtain the best approximation ? to answer this question we have calculated the cross sections at @xmath154 gev by using different numbers of partial waves , from the @xmath24-wave approximation up to @xmath155 , and we demonstrate the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : var_high_wave ] . from this figure",
    "we can immediately conclude that the calculation with @xmath156 would provide a good approximation , whereas by using @xmath157 we could achieve the best result .",
    "we note that in the latter the number of non - zero diagonal and interference terms of the components of the wave functions turns out to be 8 .",
    "obviously , this method provides a significant cpu - time reduction compared to the full calculation which has 64 non - zero components . in spite of this encouraging result , however , an extensive investigation of this approximation in a wide range of kinematics will need to be addressed in the future , before we can draw a firm conclusion that we really need the triton and hypertriton wave functions with only five partial waves to obtain a precise calculation of the hypertriton production .",
    "we have investigated the photo- and electroproduction of hypertriton on the @xmath0he nucleus by utilizing the modern nuclear wave functions obtained as a solution of the faddeev equations and the elementary operator kaon - maid .",
    "it has been shown that the proper treatment of the fermi motion is essential in this process . while the average momentum approximation @xmath125 can partly simulate the fermi motion , the `` frozen nucleon '' assumption yields very different results , especially at lower energies .",
    "this indicate that the effect of non - localities generated by fermi motion is important in the electromagnetic production of hypertriton . on the other hand , although the exited meson is a positive kaon , the coulomb effect induced by its interaction with the hypertriton is found to be negligible .",
    "the influence of higher partial waves is also found to be small , in contrast to the finding in the previous work .",
    "the off - shell assumption is found to be more important in the case of electroproduction rather than in photoproduction .",
    "our finding indicates that the available experimental data favor the assumption that the initial nucleon is off - shell , whereas the final hyperon is on - shell .",
    "this seems to be reasonable , since the hyperon in the hypertriton is less bound than the nucleon in the initial @xmath0he nucleus .",
    "the longitudinal cross sections are dominant in the electroproduction process .",
    "this originates from the longitudinal terms of the missing resonance @xmath1 in the elementary operator .",
    "nevertheless , the influence of various off - shell assumptions on the longitudinal cross sections is not affected by the exclusion of this resonance .",
    "experimental measurements are strongly required , especially in the case of photoproduction , where we can partly settle the problems of the elementary operator due to the lack of data consistency and of the knowledge on the nucleon resonances as well as hadronic coupling constants .",
    "for this case , @xmath134 and forward directions represent the recommended kinematics , for which the effects of non - localities , missing resonance @xmath1 , as well as various off - shell assumptions are found to be quite significant .",
    "further measurements of the hypertriton electroproduction are obviously useful , especially if we want to explore the role of the longitudinal terms in the elementary operator and to recheck the trend of the angular distribution of the differential cross sections .",

    "<S> differential cross sections of the photo- and electroproduction of the hypertriton have been calculated by utilizing modern nuclear wave functions and the elementary operator of kaon - maid . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that a proper treatment of fermi motion is essential for the two processes . </S>",
    "<S> while the average momentum approximation can partly simulate the fermi motion in the process , the `` frozen nucleon '' assumption yields very different results , especially at lower energies . the coulomb effect induced by the interaction between the positively charged kaon and the hypertriton </S>",
    "<S> is found to be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of higher partial waves is also found to be relatively small , in contrast to the finding of the previous work . </S>",
    "<S> the off - shell assumption is found to be very sensitive in the case of electroproduction rather than in photoproduction . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the few available experimental data favor the assumption that the initial nucleon is off - shell and the final hyperon is on - shell . </S>",
    "<S> this seems to be reasonable , since the hyperon in the hypertriton is less bound than the nucleon in the initial @xmath0he nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the missing resonance @xmath1 is more profound in the longitudinal cross sections . excluding this resonance reduces the longitudinal cross sections by one order of magnitude , but does not change the effects of various off - shell assumptions on the cross sections . </S>"
