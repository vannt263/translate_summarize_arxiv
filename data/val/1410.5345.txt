    "experiments have demonstrated the ability to use continuous weak measurements to control the behavior of single quantum systems in a variety of technologies : including optical systems @xcite , atom - optical systems @xcite , superconducting microwave systems @xcite , and nv diamond @xcite .",
    "more recently , experiments have shown that it is possible to reconstruct quantum trajectories from the experimental records generated by continuous weak measurements in superconducting microwave devices @xcite .    the use of continuous weak measurements to probe the behavior of individual quantum mechanical devices has been considered for over 30 years .",
    "this is often referred to as _",
    "quantum filtering_. that is , generating an estimate of the underlying state of the quantum system that is conditioned on the measurements that have been obtained .",
    "belavkin formulated the basic theory for quantum filtering in the early 1980 s @xcite , and related approaches evolved separately in the late 1980 s in a number of forms , see @xcite for relevant reviews .",
    "using classical signals generated by weak measurements to effect controls is often referred to as measurement - based quantum control @xcite or incoherent quantum feedback control @xcite , as opposed to coherent quantum feedback control @xcite ",
    "see @xcite for recent comprehensive review of the subject .",
    "continuous weak measurements are normally derived by considering a direct ( projective ) measurement on a coupled quantum system , consisting of an environment and the quantum system of interest .",
    "if the environment is much larger than the system of interest , any back action of the projective measurement on the combined system will have a relatively small ( i.e. weak ) effect on the system of interest , compared to its natural evolution .",
    "it is also common to make a markov approximation , which assumes that any correlations between the system and the environment are damped on timescales shorter than any of the timescales present in the system of interest . by averaging over the environmental degrees of freedom ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an effective evolution for the system of interest , either in average form ( the master equation ) or in a form which provides a quantum state that is conditioned on the specific measurement record obtained for the single system ( the stochastic master equation , sme ) .",
    "the evolution of the conditional state represents the best estimate of the evolution of the single quantum system of interest and provides a quantum trajectory for that system ( often referred to as an ` unraveling ' of the master equation ) .",
    "the ability to generate a quantum trajectory from an experimental measurement record provides an opportunity to implement a particular form of measurement - based / incoherent feedback control called _ rapid purification_. in 2003 , jacobs proposed the use of quantum feedback control to modify the speed at which a completely mixed ( unknown ) quantum state could be purified @xcite .",
    "that is , feedback is used to modify the rate at which information about the quantum state is extracted from the system . in @xcite",
    ", jacobs showed that the use of measurement - based feedback could increase the average rate of purification for a single qubit by up to a factor of two .",
    "this control protocol is relevant for future experiments because existing experiments require that the system be initialized in a known pure state using a projective measurement before the quantum trajectory can be found @xcite .",
    "more general approaches using mixed initial states require information to be extracted gradually as the weak measurements are recorded .",
    "subsequent studies on rapid purification showed that the proposed protocol was optimal , in that it maximized the average rate of purification , but it did not minimize the time taken to reach a given level of purity @xcite .",
    "other work has generalized these results for different optimization conditions @xcite , n - level systems @xcite , practical implementation of the controls @xcite , shared entangled states @xcite , imperfections @xcite , inefficient detection @xcite , and mixed protocols @xcite . in particular , li et al . demonstrated that when the efficiency of the detector is lower than 50% , there is no predicted speed up in purification rate @xcite .",
    "this result is significant for the recent quantum trajectory experiments in superconducting microwave systems because the estimated detection efficiency is given as 40% in @xcite .",
    "the paper has two main aims : the extension of a numerical integration method @xcite to address the case of inefficient continuous weak measurements , and the application of this method to a specific example of quantum control for two coupled qubits in a mixed initial state .",
    "the paper provides an efficient numerical method to solve the stochastic master equation for a given measurement record or realization .",
    "it uses this method to demonstrate a two - qubit feedback control scheme for completely mixed initial states that is robust and amenable to implementation in current experimental systems .",
    "the integration method was discussed for efficient continuous weak measurements in @xcite ; here it is adapted to deal with inefficient detection and extended to include higher order corrections .",
    "the resultant method ensures the positiveness of the conditional quantum state ( as represented by the density matrix ) and can be simplified further , reducing the computational load associated with the solution of the sme without a commensurate effect on the accuracy of the conditioned state .",
    "the intention is to develop a quantum filter that could be used for online quantum state estimation and feedback control .",

    "the signal is discretized between a set of thresholds ( @xmath106 bits , @xmath107 discrete values requires @xmath108 threshold values ) where the thresholds are uniformly distributed between @xmath109 .",
    "the measurement signals contain a significant gaussian noise term , so this range corresponds roughly to 3 standard deviations . for 4 or more bits per measurement",
    ", the accuracy of the resultant state is unaffected by the reduced number of bits , with the average fidelity approaching 99% , and the entanglement of the estimated state is robust for 3 or more bits per measurement .",
    "similar calculations using 20 integration steps per cycle show similarly robust results , with an average fidelity of around @xmath110 .",
    "numerical calculations using a single bit per measurement have been demonstrated elsewhere @xcite , but this requires significantly higher measurement frequencies than the results demonstrated here .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed a method for the efficient integration of the stochastic master equation for a quantum system under the action of continuous weak measurements , and we have demonstrated that it offers significant advantages in terms of accuracy and stability over the euler - milstein integration method for finite time steps .",
    "we have used an example with two coupled qubits subject to inefficient local measurements and local controls to show that the proposed method can be used with incoherent ( measurement - based ) quantum feedback control .",
    "the fidelity of the estimated ( conditioned ) quantum state and the resultant quantum trajectory are very good , even when the number of integration steps is very low ( or the time steps are very long ) . in addition , the entanglement between the two qubits is remarkably robust for very low numbers of time steps , and with a number of additional simplifying approximations for the state update process and for the digitization of the measurement signal .",
    "using as few as 3 or 4 bits per measurement and 50 measurements per qubit period would allow the construction of a conditioned state that is sufficiently accurate ( fidelity , @xmath111 ) to allow feedback control to be used to generate states with a concurrence very close to the maximum obtainable .    the ability to use local measurements ,",
    "an efficient state estimation process , and local quantum feedback controls to manipulate the entanglement between two coupled qubits offers a range of experimental realizations .",
    "the required continuous measurement frequencies are within the scope of recent experimental developments and have been demonstrated through the calculation of quantum trajectories from continuous weak measurements @xcite . the main obstacles to demonstrating such feedback control of entanglement are the efficiency of the local measurement interactions and the the ability to calculate the updates in real time .",
    "the results given above are not critically dependent on the efficiency of the measurement process , but lower efficiency measurements limit the purity and the entanglement found in the final conditioned state . the ability to use fairly coarse approximations in the update step and limited bit digital measurements should assist greatly when implementing the state estimation process and the feedback controls for hardware and/or software reconfigurable processors .",

    "pr would like to thank claude le bris for useful discussions and advice concerning the numerical scheme .",
