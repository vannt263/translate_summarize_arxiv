    "the generalized einstein - maxwell theories have received a lot of attention recently because it contains higher derivative interactions and carries more information about the electromagnetic field .",
    "the study of such kind of generalized einstein - maxwell theories could help us to explore the full properties and effects of the electromagnetic fields .",
    "in general , the generalized einstein - maxwell theories can be classified into two classes . the first class is minimally coupled gravitational - electromagnetism in which there is no coupling in the lagrangian between the maxwell part and the curvature part .",
    "one of the interesting generalized einstein - maxwell theory belong to this class is born - infeld theory @xcite which removes the divergence of the electron s self - energy in the classical electrodynamics and possesses good physical properties including the absence of shock waves and birefringence phenomena @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is found that born - infeld theory enjoys an electric - magnetic duality @xcite and can describe gauge fields on a d - brane which arises from attached open strings @xcite .",
    "the second class includes the nonminimal coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "this class is of great interest because the appearance of the nonminimal couplings in the lagrangian modifies the coefficients of the second - order derivatives both in the maxwell and einstein equations , which could affect the propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in the spacetime and may yield time delays in the arrival of those waves @xcite . in the evolution of the early universe , such a kind of coupled terms may result in electromagnetic quantum fluctuations and lead to the inflation @xcite .",
    "recent investigations also show that these cross - terms have been used as attempts to explain the large scale magnetic fields observed in clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to search the solutions of black holes in the generalized einstein - maxwell theories and to probe how the generalized electrodynamics modify the properties of the black hole . in the frame of the born - infeld theory ,",
    "the electrically charged black hole solutions were obtained in @xcite , which displays that the black hole singularity in this theory is weaked from that of usual reissner - nordstr m black hole . in order to avoid the black hole singularity problem ,",
    "some regular models of black holes have been proposed in @xcite , which are called as bardeen black holes .",
    "the bardeen black holes can be interpreted as the solution to a nonlinear magnetic monopole with a mass @xmath3 and a charge @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the bardeen black holes are also generalized to the model with four specific parameters @xcite .",
    "recently , a large class of black hole solutions have been constructed in the power maxwell theory @xcite in which the maxwell action takes as power - law function of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a coupling constant and @xmath7 is a power parameter .",
    "it is found that the asymptotic behavior of the solution depends heavily on the value of the power parameter @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the black hole solution have been considered in the modified maxwell field including the nonminimal coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it is shown that these coupled terms modify the electromagnetic and gravitational structure of a charged black hole .",
    "one of simple generalized electromagnetic theories is the electrodynamics with weyl corrections which involves a coupling between the maxwell field and the weyl tensor @xcite . in this theory",
    ", the lagrangian density of the electromagnetic field is modified as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the usual electromagnetic tensor , which is related to the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath10 by @xmath11 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath0 is a coupling constant with dimensions of length squared and the tensor @xmath12 is so - called weyl tensor , which is related to the riemann tensor @xmath13 , the ricci tensor @xmath14 and the ricci scalar @xmath15 by @xmath16\\nu}-g_{\\nu[\\rho}r_{\\sigma]\\mu})+\\frac{2}{(n-1)(n-2)}r g_{\\mu[\\rho}g_{\\sigma]\\nu},\\label{wten}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the dimension and metric of the spacetime , and brackets around indices refers to the antisymmetric part .",
    "therefore , the electrodynamics with weyl corrections ( [ lem ] ) is a special kind of electromagnetic theory which contains a coupling between the gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "it was found that the such kind of couplings between curvature tensor and maxwell tensor could be obtained from a calculation in qed of the photon effective action from one - loop vacuum polarization on a curved background @xcite .",
    "moreover , the investigations also show that these couplings could exist near classical compact astrophysical objects with high mass density and strong gravitational field such as the supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently , many efforts have been focus on studying the effects of weyl correction on black hole physics . in ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors studied the holographic conductivity and charge diffusion with weyl correction in the anti - de sitter spacetime and found that the correction breaks the universal relation with the @xmath19 central charge observed at leading order .",
    "moreover , the holographic superconductors with weyl corrections are also studied in @xcite .",
    "it is found that weyl corrections modify the critical temperature at which holographic superconductors occur @xcite and changes the order of the phase transition of the holographic superconductor @xcite .",
    "the effects of weyl corrections on the phase transition between the holographic insulator and superconductor has been also investigated in @xcite .",
    "recently , we @xcite studied the dynamical evolution of the electromagnetic perturbation coupling to the weyl tensor in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime and analyze the effect of the weyl corrections on the stability of the black hole .",
    "it is well known that the properties and structure of a charged black hole depend heavily on the electrodynamics of maxwell field in the spacetime , which means that the corrections to the standard einstein - maxwell theory must bring some new features for the charged black hole .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the charged black hole in the electromagnetic theory with weyl corrections , and to probe how the weyl corrections modify its properties and structure .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we will construct a static and spherically symmetric solution of a black hole with small weyl corrections , and then study the effect of the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 on the black hole . in sec.iii , we obtain a rotating charged black hole with small weyl corrections by the method of complex coordinate transformation @xcite and study the change of the spatial topology of the event horizons and the infinite redshift surface originating from the weyl corrections .",
    "we end the paper with a summary .",
    "let us now first study a static and spherically symmetric charged black hole with weyl correction .",

    "it means that with the increase of the weyl corrections the energy extraction become easier in the background of a black hole with @xmath1 , but more difficult in the background of a black hole with @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we present firstly a four - dimensional spherical symmetric black hole with small weyl corrections and find that the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 affects the radius of the event horizon , hawking temperature and hawking radiation of the black hole .",
    "moreover , we find that with the increasing weyl corrections the region of the event horizon existence for the black hole increases for the negative @xmath0 and decreases for the positive @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we obtain also a rotating charged black hole with weak weyl corrections by the method of complex coordinate transformation .",
    "we find that presence of weyl corrections makes the black hole horizon as a function of the polar angle coordinate @xmath108 , which brings some special properties of the black hole horizon .",
    "in particular , the rotating black hole with @xmath2 develops two disconnected topologically spherical horizons above some critical spin and charge parameters . in the case with @xmath1 , the horizon looks more like a toroidal surface above some critical @xmath65 and @xmath4 . comparing with the spacetime with @xmath2 , the change of the topological properties of the horizons become easier in the spacetime with @xmath1 .",
    "we also analyze the dependence of the ergosphere on the weyl coupling parameter @xmath0 and find that the ergosphere in the equatorial plane becomes thick for a black hole with @xmath1 , but becomes thin in the case with @xmath2 .",
    "it means that with the increase of the weyl corrections the energy extraction become easier in the background of a black hole with @xmath1 , but more difficult in the background of a black hole with @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we must point out that we here have not discussed the thermodynamic properties of the rotating charged black hole with the weyl corrections .",
    "the main reason is that the radius of black hole horizon is a function of the polar angle coordinate @xmath108 , which leads to that the surface gravity @xmath116 is not a well - defined quantity at the killing horizon .",
