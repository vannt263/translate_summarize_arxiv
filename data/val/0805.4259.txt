    "while these kinds of symmetries rarely exist , there are various senses in which approximate replacements can usually be introduced . one method for finding vector fields that are `` almost killing '' is to write down an action whose value provides some sense for how nearly a particular flow preserves the metric @xcite .",

    "there are several types of exact symmetries that may be discussed .",
    "the most common of these take the form of vector fields whose associated diffeomorphisms preserve some geometric structure .",
    "the most ubiquitous examples are the killing fields .",
    "their flows preserve the metric .",
    "vector fields @xmath2 with this property satisfy @xmath3 any solutions that may exist can be used to find conserved quantities associated with geodesics or matter distributions @xcite , identify mass centers @xcite , simplify einstein s equation @xcite , classify its solutions @xcite , and so on .",
    "this utility has ( among other reasons ) motivated various generalizations of ( [ killingdef ] ) .",
    "perhaps the simplest of these arises from considering flows that preserve the metric only up to some constant factor : @xmath4 any @xmath5 satisfying this equation with constant @xmath6 is known as a homothetic vector field or homothety .",
    "allowing the dilation factor @xmath6 to vary would define a conformal killing vector .",
    "these objects preserve the metric up to an arbitrary multiplicative factor .",

    "conformal and homothetic vector fields usually do not exist .",
    "their presence can be very useful , however .",
    "the existence of a proper ( non - killing ) homothetic vector is often used to define a notion of geometric self - similarity , for example .",
    "such objects therefore appear in certain models of gravitational collapse and cosmology .",
    "they are also related to the appearance of critical phenomena in general relativity @xcite .",
    "a simple generalization of the homotheties can be found by considering vector fields that satisfy @xmath7 solutions to this equation are known as affine collineations .",
    "they are the generators of infinitesimal affine transformations . killing and homothetic vector fields are special cases .",
    "all of the affine collineations may be interpreted geometrically as preserving the levi - civita connection .",

    "the only non - flat vacuum spacetimes that admit non - homothetic affine collineations are the _ pp_-waves @xcite .",

    "interesting affine collineations can occasionally be identified in geometries that are not ricci - flat .",
    "doing so provides a number of simplifications for various problems .",

    "furthermore , any single element is uniquely determined by its value and the values of its first one or two derivatives at a single point .",
    "these properties are well - known for killing fields .",
    "four dimensional spacetimes ( which is all that will be considered here ) admit a maximum of 10 linearly independent killing vectors . at most",
    "one homothety can exist that is not itself killing .",
    "the maximum number of ( not necessarily proper ) conformal killing vectors is 15 , and the affine collineations total no more than 20 .",
    "finally , the space of projective collineations has a maximum of 24 dimensions @xcite .",
    "properties like these do not hold for vector fields whose flows leave invariant the riemann , ricci , or einstein curvature tensors of a given spacetime . despite this , the class of approximate symmetries introduced below is constructed so as to have finite dimension .",

    "these objects always exist at least in some finite region .",

    "ten of these will be identifiable as generalized killing vectors , while the remaining ten will be related to more general affine collineations .",
    "it has already been remarked that the presence of killing fields implies the existence of various conserved quantities .",
    "the same can also be said for more general collineations .",
    "extensive discussions of exact symmetries and associated integrals of the geodesic equation may be found in @xcite .",
    "many of these symmetries are non - noetherian in the sense that they preserve the equations of motion , but not the action . despite this",

    "[ sect : conslaws ] , generalizations of these quantities can be associated with any approximate affine collineations that are identified .",
    "generic symmetries in general relativity are usually discussed in the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes . there then exist approximate notions of isometry that improve as one approaches infinity @xcite .",
    "generalizations of these ideas also exist for geometries with somewhat more complicated ( but still highly symmetric ) asymptotic behavior like that of anti - de sitter @xcite .",

    "such transformations can be made to induce shifts @xmath29 in spacetime points associated with vectors @xmath25 via @xmath30    a simple relation between @xmath21 and @xmath31 is found by introducing synge s world function @xmath32 .",
