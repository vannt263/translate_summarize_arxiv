    "baade and zwicky @xcite in their seminal work were the first to suggest that supernovae ( sne ) draw their energy from the gravitational collapse of a star into a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "after almost a century the processes by which part of this gravitational energy is channeled to explode the star remain controversial .",
    "@xcite suggested that neutrinos emitted by the cooling newly formed ns play the major role in setting the explosion .",
    "later @xcite and @xcite develop this idea into the delayed - neutrino mechanism . in this model neutrinos emitted within a period of @xmath1 after the bounce of the collapsed core heat material at the gain region ( @xmath2 ) enough to expel the rest of the star . in the last two decades",
    "sophisticated multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations with ever increasing capabilities were used to study the delayed neutrino mechanism ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism , although appealing , remains controversial .",
    "highly sophisticated multidimensional simulations in the last several years did not manage to explode the star with the observed kinetic energy .",
    "it seems that in most of the cases where explosion with an energy of @xmath3 was achieved , the explosion was driven by a continuous wind from the center .",
    "for example , we examine the results of bruenn et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and find that the increase of energy with time fits an explosion by a continuous wind .",
    "more details of their simulations are required to fully capture the exploding agent .",
    "such winds were suggested to power supernovae explosions in the past ( @xcite ) but where found to have limited contribution to the explosion for a more massive than @xmath4 starts . in many cases",
    "the simulations have failed to even revive the shock of the infalling core material . in a study that scaled energy according to sn 1987a ,",
    "it was found that even if neutrino explosion does work for some ccsne , no explosions with kinetic energy of @xmath5 are achieved @xcite . however , many ccsne , e.g. , some recent type ic sne ( @xcite ) seem to have kinetic energy of @xmath6 .",
    "recent results have shown that in more realistic 3d numerical simulations explosions are even harder to achieve @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite obtained opposite results , i.e. , it is easier to achieve shock revival in 3d simulations . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we argued that the delayed - neutrino mechanism has a generic character that prevents it from exploding the star with the observed energy of @xmath7 .",
    "as written above , some of the problems of the delayed - neutrino mechanism can be lifted if there is a strong neutrino wind .",
    "the lack of persisting success in exploding core collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) with the delayed - neutrino mechanism and the diversity of ccsne being discovered in recent years ( e.g. , @xcite ) show the importance of considering alternative models for ccsn explosions . among the variety of alternative explosion mechanisms @xcite",
    "the magnetohydrodynamics class of models is one of the well studied ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in most of the mhd models",
    "the magnetic field is enhanced by a rapidly rotating core through the magnetorotational mechanism , creating bipolar outflows ( jets ) that are able to explode the star .",
    "most stellar evolution models show that the core s rotation rate in most cases is too low for the magnetorotational mechanism to be significant , making most of these models applicable for only special cases .",
    "recent observations ( e.g. @xcite ) show that jets might have a much more general role in ccsne than that which is suggested by these models .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite we proposed a jets - based mechanism that might be present in all ccsne explosions , and where the sources of angular momentum are the convective regions in the core @xcite and/or instabilities in the shocked region of the collapsing core , e.g. , the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite who suggested that the source of the angular momentum of pulsars is the spiral mode of the sasi .",
    "recent 3d numerical simulations show indeed that the sasi is well developed during the first second after core bounce ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "another motivation to consider jet - driven explosion mechanisms is that jets might supply the site for the r - process @xcite .    in the present study we conduct 2.5d numerical simulations to study the explosion of the core in the frame of the jittering - jet explosion mechanism @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients and assumptions of this mechanism are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) we do not try to revive the stalled shock , to the contrary , our model requires the material near the stalled - shock to fall inward and form an accretion disk around the newly born ns or black hole ( bh ) .",
    "( 2 ) we conjecture that due to envelope stochastic processes , such as convection and the sasi , segments of the post - shock accreted gas ( inward to the stalled shock wave ) possess local angular momentum . when they accreted they form and accretion disk with rapidly varying axis direction .",
    "in a recent study gilkis & soker ( 2013 ) have shown that the convective region in the oxygen burning shell , and in many cases the silicon - burning shell , will indeed lead to stochastic angular momentum accretion that is sufficient to form intermittent accretion disk around the newly born ns .",
    "( 3 ) we assume that the accretion disk launches two opposite jets . due to the rapid change in the disk s axis , the jets can be intermittent and their direction rapidly varying .",
    "these are termed _ jittering jets_. ( 4 ) we analytically showed in @xcite that the jets penetrate the infalling gas up to a distance of @xmath8 , i.e. , beyond the stalled - shock .",
    "however , beyond @xmath8 the jets can not penetrate the gas any more because of their jittering .",
    "the jittering jets do nt have the time to drill holes through the ambient gas before their direction changes ; they are shocked before penetrating through the ambient gas .",
    "this condition can be met if the jets axis rapidly changes its direction .",
    "this process of depositing jets energy into the ambient medium to prevent further accretion is termed the _ non - penetrating jet feedback mechanism _ @xcite .",
    "( 5 ) the jets deposit their energy inside the collapsing star via shock waves , and form two hot bubbles , that eventually merge and accelerate the rest of the star and lead to the explosion .",
    "( 6 ) the jets are launched only in the last phase of accretion onto the ns . for the required energy the jets",
    "must be launched from the very inner region of the accretion disk . in this study",
    "we explore the flow structure described in points ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : numerical ] we describe the numerical setup for the 2.5d simulations . in section [ sec : results ] we describe our results , focusing on the general flow structure and the way the explosion starts in the core . in section [ sec : acc ]",
    "we show that sufficient mass is accreted to close the feedback cycle . in the present study",
    "we do not simulate the entire star .",
    "our summary is in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use the 4th version of the flash gasdynamical numerical code @xcite .",
    "the widely used flash code is a publicly available code for supersonic flow suitable for astrophysical applications .",
    "the simulations are done using the unsplit ppm solver of flash .",
    "we use 2d axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates with an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) grid ; this is referred to as 2.5d type of simulations .",
    "the grid is divided into two regions .",
    "( 1 ) a spherical inner region with a radius of about @xmath9 . inside this region",
    "we set the maximum refinement level to be proportional to angular size .",
    "this is up to a radius of @xmath10 where the maximum refinement level is constant and with a resolution of about @xmath11 .",
    "( 2 ) in the region outside @xmath9 we set a constant maximum refinement level which coincides with the maximum refinement level at the outer boundary of the inner region ; the resolution in the outer region is @xmath12 .",
    "this separation into two different regions enables us to simulate both the region near the ns where we inject the jets and the large scale regions where the jets interact with the surrounding core material .",
    "the total size of the grid is @xmath13 .",
    "we treat the spherical inner region of up to @xmath14 from the center as a hole .",
    "this means that we are not simulating the ns itself , nor the assumed accretion disk .",
    "the boundary condition at the edge of the hole is inflow only , meaning the velocity can not be positive in the radial direction unless we inject a jet at that specific zone .",
    "we start the simulations after the core has collapsed and bounced back .",
    "the initial conditions are taken for a @xmath15 model from the 1d simulations of @xcite at a time of @xmath16 after bounce .",
    "we map their results into 2d , including the chemical composition .",
    "we set outflow boundary conditions at the exteriors of the simulation s domain .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) was chosen to be the helmholtz eos @xcite implemented by flash .",
    "this eos includes contributions from partial degenerate electrons and positrons , radiation , and non degenerate ions .",
    "it is appropriate for our simulations as we do not simulate the most inner part where nuclear density is reached .",
    "we added to the code neutrino cooling .",
    "the cooling rate is taken to be @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the temperature in @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the density in @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the mass fraction of free nucleons . the first term is the contribution of electron positron pair annihilation @xcite and the second is due to electron / positron capture on free nucleons @xcite .",
    "gravity is treated using a point mass of @xmath23 at the center plus a contribution from the monopole term ( @xmath24 ) in the simulation s domain .",
    "we inject the jets during their activity inside the inner boundary with a velocity of @xmath25 and a density @xmath26 derived from the required outflow rate of @xmath27 , here @xmath28 is the opening solid angle ; @xmath29 is the total outflow mass in the two bipolar jets .",
    "there is a delicate matter of translating jets from 3d to 2.5d simulations .",
    "one can not maintain both ram pressure and power from 3d to 2.5d as non - axial jets have the shape of a conical shell in 2.5d . in our simulations",
    "we keep the ram pressure constant by keeping the density and velocity as in 3d simulations . to preserve energy and mass we activate the jets for shorter times such that the total energy and mass in each episode is the same as in 3d simulations .",
    "the schematic jets launching angles are depicted in figure [ fig : angles ] .",
    "the total width of the jets is @xmath30 .",
    "we actually inject a conical shell due to the 2.5d nature of the grid . in each pulse material",
    "is injected within a conical shell given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the center of the shell .",
    "such a conical shell might actually be formed by a very rapid precession of the accretion disk , hence jets launching direction , around an axis ; hence our term of 2.5d simulations .",
    "we note that the jittering - jets explosion model requires no initial core angular momentum .",
    "however , the 2.5d simulations performed here are limited to jittering around a preferred axis ( the symmetry axis of the grid )",
    ". a non - negligible amount of angular momentum in the pre - collapse core can cause the ` jittering ' to take place around a preferred axis , e.g. , forming a conical shape as simulated here .",
    "the center of each jets - shell @xmath32 is varied within the range @xmath33 .",
    "the range of angles and the jittering prescription are varied between the different runs , as described in the next section .",
    "we first describe the results for a run we term 2s20 - 50 , where the ` 2 ' stands for the total jets activity duration , and the the numbers ` 20 - 50 ' stand for the boundary angles of the jittering @xmath34 and @xmath35 , as drawn in fig . [",
    "fig : angles ] and given in table [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "we start this run by simultaneously launching two jets , one at each half of the equatorial plane .",
    "they are not exactly opposite to mimic the stochastic nature of the jittering jet model ( see angles in table [ tab : table1 ] ) .",
    "the total jets mass of all episodes combined and the launching velocity are the same for the three runs with jets studied here , with values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",

    "since efficiency is not @xmath112 , the typical explosion energy is few times the binding energy , @xmath7 , and above . in low mass stars",
    "the core s binding energy is lower , and weaker explosions are possible .",
    "even that feedback is not included in our calculations , in section [ sec : acc ] we find that the accreted mass during the jets activity phase is sufficient to power the jets under the assumptions of the model .",
