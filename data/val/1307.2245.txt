    "einstein s gravity is the theory that describes the two degrees of freedom of the massless helicity-2 representation of the poincar group , and their two derivative self - interactions .",

    ", such a deformation would correspond to adding a potential for the metric perturbation .",
    "an obvious example is the potential described by the cosmological constant ( cc ) term , @xmath0 .",
    "this changes neither the number of propagating degrees of freedom of general relativity ( gr ) , nor the consistency of the theory , but necessarily alters the background spacetime .    the cc is the only such term  other potentials inevitably change the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "the fierz - pauli term @xcite is the unique consistent quadratic potential that gives rise to 5 degrees of freedom , as required by the massive spin-2 representation of the poincar group . adding a generic potential to the eh action however leads to the loss of all four hamiltonian constraints of gr , and thus a total of six propagating degrees of freedom , one of which is necessarily a ghost @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there exists a special class of mass and potential terms ( the often - called drgt terms @xcite , see @xcite for a review ) that make the graviton massive , while retaining one of the four hamiltonian constraints .",
    "this remaining constraint projects out the ghostly sixth degree of freedom @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "in addition to the cc term , the drgt construction allows for @xmath1 free parameters .",
    "one combination is the graviton mass , @xmath2 , and the other two independent combinations , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , set the strength of the nonlinear potential .",
    "the theory can be formulated by using four spurious diffeomorphism scalars , @xmath5  first introduced in an earlier proposal for massive gravity @xcite  to allow for a manifestly diffeomorphism - invariant description . adopting these four scalars , and following @xcite",

    "three of the four auxiliary scalars @xmath5 are  eaten \" by the graviton to form a massive spin-2 representation of the latter group , while the fourth , potentially ghostly scalar is made non - dynamical by the single remaining hamiltonian constraint of massive gr , originating from the specific structure of the drgt terms @xmath11 .",
    "the drgt theory gets rid of the sixth ghostly mode , and also guarantees that the remaining 5 are unitary degrees of freedom at low energies and on nearly - minkowski backgrounds ( i.e. , the backgrounds with typical curvature smaller than the graviton mass square ) .",
    "however , the theory does not guarantee that for more general backgrounds the 5 physical modes are healthy .",
    "in fact , some of their kinetic terms may change signs around certain cosmological backgrounds . moreover , for a large region of the @xmath16 parameter space , the potential is known to violate the null energy condition and one often gets kinetic and gradient terms that give rise to superluminal group and phase velocities .",
    "most of the above issues stem from one and the same source : the drgt theory is strongly coupled at the energy / momentum scale @xmath17 @xcite . as a result , a typical curvature of order @xmath18 produces order 1 corrections to the kinetic terms for fluctuations , often giving rise to vanishing or negative kinetic terms , or superluminal group and phase velocities ( for brief comments on the current state of affairs on all these issues , see section 6 ) .    as for any strongly coupled theory ,",

    "this observation suggests an extension of the theory by additional fields ( see section 2 , and section 3 for a @xmath31 symmetric extension ) .    as we will discuss in section 3 ,",
    "the vierbein formulation enables one to give a geometric interpretation to the mass and potential terms  they can be expressed in terms of certain volume forms .",
    "there are other benefits as well : we find that the decoupling limit is much simpler to extract in this approach .",
    "the original results of @xcite can be obtained with significantly less effort .",

    "form expressions for the vector modes , which have not been obtained in complete generality before .",

    "we parametrize the general vierbein as a constrained vierbein @xmath50 satisfying , times a lorentz transformation , parametrized as the exponential of a matrix @xmath51 ( which is anti - symmetric with respect to @xmath35 ) , [ vierbeinlparam ] e = e e^-b ,  b = -b^t .",

    "therefore , the only terms that appear at lowest order are the ones containing traces of one power of @xmath55 along with powers of @xmath56 . because @xmath56 is symmetric and @xmath55 antisymmetric , and because @xmath55 appears only linearly ,",
    "the terms in the equations of motion linear in @xmath51 all vanish .",
    "this means that the equations of motion of @xmath51 start linearly in @xmath51 , and are solved by @xmath57 .",
    "plugging this solution back into the action , we see that the action with unconstrained vierbeins is dynamically equivalent to the action with symmetric vierbeins .    to relate the potential with symmetric vierbeins to the potential in the metric formulation we use the matrix representation @xmath58 , g^-1 = ( e^-1)^t ^-1 e^-1 . using the parametrization and the symmetry property of @xmath56 : = @xmath59^t .",

    "all possible embeddings parameterized by @xmath106 to make a comparison between different volume forms meaningful .",
    "both differences complicate the geometrical identification of these mixing terms .",
    "however , for any fixed @xmath106 , each term in can be given a geometric interpretation in terms of a difference between certain volume forms of the two different manifolds .",

    "another peculiar feature of the above action is that @xmath191 acquires a mass @xmath192 .",
    "this is below the cutoff of the effective theory to the extent that @xmath193 .",
    "note that , in order to reproduce the correct sign of the vector kinetic term at low energies , @xmath194 has to be tachyonic ; however , one could expect higher powers of @xmath34 ( e.g. @xmath195 ) to also be present , and these could stabilize the @xmath34 potential . likewise , the kinetic term of the vector acquires a modification . in the regime , @xmath196 ,",
    "the modification is irrelevant and @xmath197 propagates the usual two vector polarizations of the massive graviton .",
    "note that the residue of the vector particle propagator vanishes at the position of the pole of the @xmath34 field .",
    "one can give the above generation of the mass @xmath198 an anderson mechanism - like interpretation .",
    "indeed , both of the antisymmetric fields , @xmath79 and @xmath34 , nonlinearly realize the local lorentz invariance .",
    "one can always choose a gauge in which either of the two , e.g. @xmath79 , is frozen to be zero , however one combination of these is gauge invariant ( at the linear level , the invariant combination is simply @xmath199 ) .",
    "then , the gauge - invariant combination ( which reduces to @xmath34 in the @xmath188 gauge ) acquires a mass due to the spontaneous breaking of llt .    finally , we comment on ghost - freedom of the interactions of the antisymmetric field @xmath34 with the rest of the modes , present in the decoupling limit lagrangian . the object @xmath200 is decomposed ( excluding the symmetric vierbein perturbation ) in the @xmath188 gauge",

    "the only two interactions for which this property is not apparent are of the @xmath201-type .",
    "the first of these is @xmath202 .",
    "the only potentially dangerous , three - derivative term arises in the equation of motion for @xmath158 ( all other similar terms vanish by antisymmetrization ) , and has the following form , @xmath203 now , antisymmetrization in the @xmath204 and @xmath205 indices tells us that the object in the parentheses is antisymmetric in the @xmath206 pair . contracted with @xmath207 on the scalar , the term at hand vanishes",
    "likewise , a potentially dangerous term in the lagrangian @xmath208 yields an apparently ghostly contribution to the @xmath158-equation of motion ^_ab  .however , the object in the square parentheses in this expression is manifestly symmetric under @xmath209 . contracted with the antisymmetric @xmath210 ,",
    "this again yields zero . of course ,",
    "although this is a nice consistency - check , such a vanishing of the three - derivative terms in the equations of motion is by no means surprising and follows automatically from the inherent ghost - freedom of the potential .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the status of massive gravity as applied to the real world . in this approach ,",
    "the graviton mass is taken to be of the order of the present day hubble parameter , @xmath211 ( for phenomenological bounds on the graviton mass see @xcite ) .",
    "although this is a very small parameter as compared to the planck scale , such smallness is robust  the mass parameter does not get renormalized by large quantum corrections @xcite ; this is unlike the cosmological constant which does receive large renormalizations .",
    "therefore , it is appealing to describe the observed cosmic acceleration as an effect due to a nonzero graviton mass .",
    "massive gravitons can produce a state with the stress - tensor mimicking dark energy ( the so  called self - accelerated solutions @xcite ) .",
    "massive gravity dark energy is expected to have a slightly different predictions from those of cc based cosmology , and the differences may be tested observationally .",
    "these solutions produce dark energy with the equations of state identical to that of cc , but different fluctuations . unfortunately , certain fluctuations about these solutions are problematic  some of the physical 5 degrees of freedom have vanishing kinetic terms , destabilizing the background @xcite .",
    "extensions of drgt by additional scalars @xcite or bi and multi - gravity @xcite , or further extensions @xcite , also exhibit self - accelerated solutions .",
    "recently , an extension by scalars has been proposed by de felice and mukohyama @xcite and shown to have a self - accelerated solution with stable fluctuations  a first example of this kind .",
    "spherically symmetric solutions and black holes in massive gr have been studied in @xcite .",
    "a general issue in drgt is that it is a strongly coupled theory at the distance scale @xmath212 , which for the above value of the graviton mass is @xmath213 km .",
    "this scale is background dependent , and decreases for realistic backgrounds @xcite , but never enough for one to feel comfortable with it .",
    "the higher dimensional operators  that best manifest themselves in the decoupling limit  are suppressed by this scale . moreover , on realistic backgrounds these operators give rise to order 1 or larger classical renormalization of the kinetic terms of fluctuations .",
    "that is how some of these kinetic terms vanish or flip their signs on the self - accelerated backgrounds .",
    "therefore , drgt needs an extension beyond the strong coupling scale in order for it to be potentially applicable to the real world .",
    "this extension is unknown at present , but for it to work it should introduce new states at or below the scale @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , many properties of the backgrounds and fluctuations sensitive to scales above @xmath19 can get modified in an extended theory .",
    "furthermore , in the decoupling limit drgt gets related @xcite to the galileons @xcite .",
    "the latter are known to exhibit superluminal propagation on nontrivial backgrounds .",
    "so does drgt for a large portion of the @xmath214 parameter space . for theories satisfying",
    "the froissart bound , this has been argued @xcite to preclude a standard uv completion by a local , lorentz invariant field or string theory , however , theories with long - rage fields do not necessarily obey this bound ; moreover , there is no claim to rule out a possible lorentz - violating , non - local or intrinsically higher dimensional completion .",
    "furthermore , there is an exception for some special values of @xmath214 , where subluminality for a spherically symmetric solution is achieved at the expense of not having an asymptotically flat background @xcite .",
    "the question of whether superluminality can lead to prohibitive acausality is entangled with the strong coupling issue @xcite .",
    "the conclusion of acausality of massive gravity @xcite that has been reached by constructing superluminal shock waves and characteristics is , in the context of a low energy theory , not warranted without a further nuanced study .",
    "a well known counterexample is the following : quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in an external gravitational field , at energies below the electron mass , gives rise to dimension 6 operators , one of which yields superluminal characteristics for a photon propagating in a given non - trivial gravitational background @xcite .",
    "however , this superluminality  which appears within the effective theory  does not mean that qed supplemented by gr is an acausal theory . in spite of a large body of literature on the issue of superluminality vs. acausality , some with split views",
    ", we believe that the low energy effective field theory understanding of systematic criteria for potential harms , or their absence , of superluminal low energy group and phase velocities is still to be precisely formulated @xcite .",
    "_ notes added : _ ref .",
    "@xcite has studied the decoupling limit of drgt using the vierbein formalism .",
    "this work , even though it appeared later than v1 of the present work , should be considered as concurrent on the main idea of studying the decoupling limit in this formalism ; moreover the results of @xcite on the decoupling limit are superior to ours in their completeness .",
    "the remarkable work @xcite , appearing in 2006 , introduced almost all of the ingredients of massive gravity , including the stckelbergs for the llt s ( but not the @xmath215 fields ) .",
