    "the elodie library is based on spectra retrieved from the observatoire de haute - provence archive ( moultaka et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the elodie spectrograph attached to the 1.93 m telescope , they have a spectral resolution of about r=42000 and consists of 67 echelle orders covering in total the wavelength range 389.2 to 680 nm without any gap .",
    "some of the spectra were acquired for the purpose of building a stellar library , and others were selected from the archive to complete the coverage in effective temperature ( t@xmath0 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath1 ) and metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) and to achieve the flux calibration ( by providing enough external comparisons and repeated observations of the same stars ) .    an early library , not calibrated in flux , was published in soubiran et al .",
    "the first flux - calibrated release of the library was published by prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) , it contained 906 spectra .",
    "the last previous release , elodie.3 was announced in prugniel & soubiran ( 2004 ) and represented a major progress in the coverage of the space of atmospheric parameters ( t@xmath0 , @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] ) .    the present version , elodie.3.1 is based on the same collection of spectra than elodie.3 . fig .",
    "1 , 2 and 3 show the distribution of the 1388 stars of the library in the hr diagram , t@xmath0 - [ fe / h ] and t@xmath0 - @xmath1 planes .",
    "the main interest of this new version is the extended wavelength coverage , now including the h & k lines , and limited by the blue limit of the spectrograph .",
    "some important improvements are also summarized in the next section .",
    "the library has been used for population synthesis using the pegase.hr program ( le borgne et al .",
    "2004 ) , and these models were used to study the stellar populations of galaxies and star clusters . the advantage of these models is the high spectral resolution provided by the library which allows to constrain simultaneously the internal kinematics and the parameters of the stellar population ( for instance age and metallicity ) . thanks to this library , the analysis is not anymore limited to the low resolution of the spectrophotometric indices .",
    "specific methods for the simultaneous analysis of the kinematics and of the stellar population were developed in ocvirk et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and chilingarian ( 2007 ) .",
    "it was found that these approaches of full spectrum fitting are increasing the precision on age and metallicity by a factor 3 ( a factor 10 on observing time to get the same precision ) ( koleva et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the comparison between models based on the current release of the library and other models are presented in koleva et al ( 2007a ) and validation using galactic clusters in koleva et al .",
    "( 2007b ) .",
    "we are now preparing a further version , elodie.4 , which will contain about 5000 spectra .",
    "this will allow a better investigation of the effect of the @xmath3-element abundances in stellar populations , possibly by coupling the library with a basis of theoretical spectra as presented in prugniel et al .",
    "since the first version of the library , the reduction procedure described in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) has been improved in several aspects but the general philosophy remains the same .",
    "the first steps of the data processing up to the extraction of the orders are made with the standard elodie pipeline ( baranne et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the reconnection of the orders , and the flux calibration are explained in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) .",
    "extension of the wavelength range .",
    ": :    in the previous releases the first 4 orders in the blue were not    processed because of the difficulty of their reconnection and    calibration due to the low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) .",
    "the    sensitivity of the detector is indeed dramatically dropping near the    blue limit .",
    "we improved our procedure and we could include the blue    region , extending to the h & k lines .",
    "subtraction of the diffuse light . : :    when working on the blue region of the spectra , we discovered that the    diffuse light on the standard pipeline was often under - subtracted .",
    "the    consequence was that some sharp lines in the blue were not deep    enough .",
    "the correction that we applied was validated by comparing with    spectra from other archives or libraries .",
    "improvement of the atmospheric parameters .",
    ": :    to use the library for population synthesis , a key factor is to obtain    the atmospheric parameters of the stars with the highest accuracy . in    the present case ,",
    "the atmospheric parameters are first compiled from    the literature , and an inter - comparison in the library allow to detect    inconsistencies and to determine internal values : each wavelength    point of the spectra is modeled as polynomials in    t@xmath0 , @xmath1 and [ fe / h ] fitted to the    compiled parameters and the inversion of this function returns    internal determinations of the parameters ( see prugniel & soubiran    2001 , le borgne et al .",
    "2004 ) . +    on one side we have updated the compiled input parameters , using    recent publications and fixing errors , and on the other side we    improved the polynomial functions used to model the spectra .",
    "the    present version is better , but , as seen in fig .",
    "2 and 3 , some    artifacts persist in the temperature range 6500 - 7500k at low    metallicity ( some input metallicities are underestimated ) .",
    "+    by comparing the observed spectra with the polynomial model , we get an    idea of the quality of the model and of the consistency of the    atmospheric parameters .",
    "the rms residuals from the absolute model    ( ie . using the input atmospheric parameters ) is 2.0% .",
    "the rms    residuals from the internal model ( iterated using the atmospheric    parameters returned after an inversion with the absolute model ) is    1.4% .",
    "the decrease of the rms residuals after the iteration is due to    an improvement of the consistency of the atmospheric parameters .",
    "the    final residuals include the effect of the noise and of all the    neglected parameters , like rotation , detailed abundances ... the    internal determination of the atmospheric parameters may be biased    with respect to the input values : we checked these biases by averaging    them in some regions of the parameters space , and did not find    evidence for clear bias .",

    "4 & 5 compare the lick indices measured on the elodie spectra with those of the lick ( worthey et al .",
    "1994 ) and jones ( worthey & ottaviani , 1997 ) libraries .",
    "the comparison with the lick data shows an important spread due to the lower quality of the lick data , but the comparison with jones library reveals an excellent consistency .",
    "the zero - points are extremely small , and the slope between the two series is close to 1 .",
    "this test of the slope is critical since it may unveil some data - reduction errors in the cosmic ray clipping , the rebinning or the scattered light subtraction : these three aspects potentially affecting more the strong lines , hence high metallicity stars .    .",
