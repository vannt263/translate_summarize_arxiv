    "_ electrical _ spin injection , transport and detection in diluted magnetic semiconductor ( dms)-nonmagnetic semiconductor ( nms ) based systems @xcite-@xcite are three crucial prerequisites for the successful realization of semiconductor spintronics . while the spin degree of freedom naturally is important , the charge degree of freedom plays a significant role in semiconductor spin transport as well , through electric field induced effects .",
    "several experiments@xcite-@xcite have recently shown that the spin injection efficiency is strongly dependent on both applied and intrinsic electric fields , caused by , e.g. , inhomogeneous doping . this was theoretically emphasized by yu and flatte(yf)@xcite within a drift - diffusion model from which it was shown that the magnitude and sign of an electric field strongly influences the spin relaxation length according to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a homogeneous electric field , and @xmath2 is an intrinsic ( electric field - independent ) spin diffusion length . according to eq .",
    "( [ yf ] ) , the electric field enhances(suppresses ) the spin relaxation length @xmath3 in the direction anti - parallel(parallel ) to the direction of the electric field . however , the underlying assumption leading up to eq .",
    "( [ yf ] ) was _ local charge neutrality _ , and thus homogeneous electric fields .",
    "the question is how spin polarized electrons propagate in , e.g. , inhomogeneously doped semiconductors where electric fields are inhomogeneous ?    in this paper , we use a similar approach as yf as well as self - consistent numerical calculations to study the effects of inhomogeneous electric fields .",
    "we find that , in an analogous drift - diffusion picture , a `` quasi - local '' spin relaxation length in the presence of inhomogeneous electric fields can be defined according to @xmath4^{-1}~ , \\label{ldu}\\ ] ] from which a strong electric field gradient dependence becomes evident .",
    "however , in order to understand the full influence of inhomogeneous electric fields one needs to have access to the self - consistent charge density and electric field profile .",
    "we have performed such self - consistent numerical calculations using a boltzmann - poisson equation approach for a dms - nms inhomogeneously doped semiconductor from which we demonstrate that electric field gradients indeed can play a crucial role in the propagation of spin polarized electrons .",
    "our findings may in particular highlight a possible difficulty in obtaining efficient spin polarized propagation at semiconductor interfaces between low - to - high doping concentration regions .    in the following we will show a derivation of the drift - diffusion model leading to eq .",
    "( 2 ) ( section 2 ) , followed by our numerical model ( section 3 ) , and a discussion of our results ( section 4 ) .",
    "the current for spin - up and spin - down electrons can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the diffusion constants and conductivities for the spin - up(down ) species . here , the conductivities refer to @xmath8 , in terms of the mobilities @xmath9 and densities @xmath10 of spin - up(down ) electrons .",
    "the continuity equations for the two species require that @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the spin - flip scattering rates . in steady - state eqs .",
    "( [ dd],[continuity ] ) result in @xmath13 for a nms @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "multiplying eq .",
    "( [ ddc ] ) with @xmath16 and substracting them from each other we arrive to the following expression for the spin density imbalance @xmath17 @xmath18 where we have used the einstein relation @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the spin relaxation time @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , and @xmath23 is the intrinsic spin diffusion length .    equation ( [ ddimbalance ] ) is a drift - diffusion equation for the spin density imbalance @xmath24 and contains terms depending on both the electric field , and the electric field _",
    "gradient_. we note that in fact eq .",
    "( [ ddimbalance ] ) resembles the corresponding equations in refs .",
    "@xcite , but with an _ additional term proportional to _ @xmath25 .",
    "similarly to refs .",
    "@xcite we can use the roots of the characteristic equation for eq .",
    "( [ ddimbalance ] ) to define up- and down - stream spin diffusion lengths from eq .",
    "( [ ddimbalance ] ) leading up to eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) is only defined `` locally '' , over a region where @xmath26 can be considered constant , and where an average value of the electric field is used .",
    "note also that the above equations are also valid for ferromagnetic semiconductors provided the mobility and diffusion constant are replaced with the ones corresponding to the minority - spin species@xcite .    a comparison between eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) and refs .",
    "@xcite results in that eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) above contains an additional term @xmath27 in the square root .",
    "naturally , this term plays an important role in inhomogeneously doped semiconductors .",
    "we have performed self - consistent calculations and compared them with numerical fits using eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) to verify its applicability .",
    "our self - consistent approach is based on the solution of the boltzmann and poisson equations using numerical methods developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . working in a one - dimensional model ( choosing the @xmath28 direction ) ,",
    "the transport of spin - polarized electrons is described by two bte equations according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electron distribution for the spin - up ( down ) electrons , @xmath31 is the momentum relaxation time , and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) is the scattering rate for spin - up ( down ) electrons . the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of each nonequilibrium spin distribution to a local equilibrium ( spin - dependent ) , normalized electron distribution function @xmath34 , where @xmath35 k is the lattice temperature .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ bte ] ) describes the relaxation of the spin polarization . from the distribution function @xmath36",
    "we calculate the local spin density according to @xmath37 , the total charge density , @xmath38 , and the spin density imbalance , @xmath39 . in order to take into account inhomogeneous charge distributions and electric fields",
    "we solve eq .",
    "( [ bte ] ) together with the poisson equation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dielectric constant and @xmath42 is the donor concentration profile , using finite difference and relaxation methods@xcite .",
    "we have performed self - consistent , numerical calculations for an inhomogeneously doped dms - nms structure schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] using @xmath35 k , @xmath43 , @xmath44 ps , @xmath45 ns , @xmath46 m@xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 m and @xmath50 v.    at the interface between the two doping regions with concentrations @xmath51 and @xmath52 a built - in field is expected due to the diffusion of carriers from the region with higher to the region with lower doping concentration .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] where we show the electric field profile , as well as the gradient of the electric field ( inset ) around the interfacial regions , for different doping concentrations @xmath53 .",
    "the sign and amplitude of the electric field gradients naturally depend strongly on the doping concentration @xmath52 on a length scale of the order of the screening length .    while it is not possible to use eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) directly for a quantitative analysis of the spin transport properties , one can make preliminary estimates of the order of the spin relaxation length around a specific region using linear approximations of the electric field .",
    "for example , using a linear fit of @xmath1 for @xmath54 @xmath49 m for the @xmath55 curve yields @xmath56 v/@xmath49m@xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , using a mean value of @xmath58 kv / cm and @xmath59 @xmath49 m we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ ldu ] ) a spin relaxation length value @xmath60 @xmath49 m along the ( charge ) direction of transport .",
    "similarly , it is found that @xmath61 @xmath49 m . in comparison ,",
    "an evaluation of eq .",
    "( [ yf ] ) , i.e. without the electric field gradient term , using the same value of the electric field yields @xmath62 @xmath49 m , and @xmath63 @xmath49 m .",
    "thus , the spin relaxation length in the direction of the charge flow is predicted to be strongly influenced by the inhomogeneous electric field around the doping interface .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the numerically calculated spin density imbalance , @xmath24 , and total charge density , @xmath64 , are shown for the @xmath55 structure considered in the above estimates .",
    "the total charge density ( dashed line ) increases monotonically as expected within a screening length from the low to the high doping concentration region .",
    "the spin density imbalance ( solid line ) follows a similar increase , but is , however , _",
    "significantly suppressed _ such that only a maximum of 0.5@xmath52 is reached around the interface region , beyond which @xmath24 decreases exponentially . the observed suppression is a consequence of the inhomogeneous electric fields .",
    "a crude estimate of the validity of the values for @xmath65 can be obtained by comparing our numerical calculations with @xmath66 $ ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] we show the resulting fits for @xmath67 and 36 @xmath49 m , the first and latter values corresponding to the previously estimated values for @xmath65 and @xmath68 obtained from the numerically calculated electric field profiles .",
    "we see that the higher values of @xmath68 indeed yield that @xmath69 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath68 values 0.16 and 0.3 @xmath49 m , which are of the order of the screening length , yield better fits to the numerically calculated data .",
    "our results and analysis shows that inhomogeneous electric fields can strongly influence the spin relaxation length , and that significant spin polarization suppression can occur as a result thereof .",
    "we have also high - lighted a possible mechanism that may inhibit propagation of spin polarized electrons from low - to - high regions of doping concentrations , such as encountered in future semiconductor spintronic devices .",
