    "for example , in the case of quantum well it is shown @xcite , if the well width is larger ( smaller ) than the bohr radius of exciton , the spectrum of quantum well has properties similar to the situation in which excitons are boson ( fermion ) .",

    "on the other hand , since the total number of excitation ( exciton and photon ) is conserved we can diagonalize the hamiltonian in the subspace of a definite excitation . to consider this dynamics we propose an approach based on diagonalization of the hamiltonian by using the polariton transformation @xcite .",

    "it is clear that changes of @xmath0-parameter strongly affects absorption spectra of the system .",
    "these figures show in the presence of @xmath0-values absorption of probe beam shows a complex structure : a multiple - like absorption pattern appears with one strong peak and some side bands .",
    "presence of these side bands is a signature of the optical generation of an nonlinear exciton ( an exciton which expresses with @xmath0-deformed operator ) .",
    "negative part of the absorption spectrum demonstrates gain of the probe beam . due to the resonance interaction of pump with exciton transition ,",
    "the gain effect comes from the coherent energy exchange between the pump and probe beams through the qd nonlinearity .",
    "the obtained absorption spectra are very similar to experimental results @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite absorption spectra of a driven charged qd is derived experimentally .",
    "charged qd is a nonlinear medium and is similar to our model .",
    "then it can be consider as a experimental test of our model .",
    "@xmath62-deformed description of excitons in a qd and its physical consequences was considered . we showed that increasing the @xmath0-parameter will lead to increase of splitting between peaks in the spectrum and asymmetry of spectrum .",
    "similar effects were observe when biexciton effects taken into account . in experiments of qd it is shown @xcite the same results are obtained in different temperatures .",
    "then we can associate this physical parameter as source of @xmath0-deformation .",
    "the temperature dependence of emission energy of system can be attributed to the change in the refractive index of its active medium with temperature .",
    "we have derived the optical response of qd with @xmath0-deformed exciton . as mentioned before @xmath0-deformed description of excitons will lead to dependence of optical response on @xmath0 parameter .",
    "hence , due to the wide range of @xmath0 parameter and its effects on optical response we can consider some parameters like temperature and interaction between the excitons which affects the optical response of qd as sources of @xmath0-deformation of excitons . as mentioned , the relation of quantum statistics of excitons in the qd and the size of qd has been considered .",
    "then we can consider the ratio of exciton bohr radius to dimension of system and exciton population as two main sources of @xmath0-deformation .",
    "@xmath62-deformed operator depends on total number of associated particles of system",
    ". therefore we can interpret @xmath0-deformed operator as an operator which consists of effects of other excitations of system implicitly .",
    "then it is reasonable to consider this description as an effective description which takes into account some nonlinearity in exciton system . as we saw , in the case of interaction of light with two excitons , when @xmath59 this system showed a two peaks spectrum .",
    "while by increasing deviation of exciton from bose statistics , spectrum becomes multi peak . due to the nonlinear nature of @xmath0-deformed exciton we showed that different orders of nonlinear response function of this system can be calculated . from coincidence of obtained results and experimental results",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath0-deformed description of excitons can be a considerable model for excitons . with comparing the obtained results in this paper with experimental ones we can investigate the origin of this description of excitons . as pointed out",
    "the ratio of system dimension to the bohr radius of exciton is one of the sources of deviation of excitons from usual boson .",
    "the obtained results are very similar to the effects of the exciton - exciton interaction @xcite,@xcite which is relates to exciton population and biexciton binding energy . on the other hand",
    ", it is shown that @xcite exciton density is another source of their deviation from ordinary bosons . to sum up we attribute the origin of @xmath0-deformation of the excitons to their density , their mutual interactions , confinement size and other parameters which cause fluctuation of optical response of the system .",
    "+ @xmath62-deformed description of an active medium causes that the optical properties of system depend on the @xmath0-parameter .",
    "then , it is seem that parameters which can affect optical properties of the active medium ( like refractive index ) their effects can be considered by this formulation . the @xmath0-parameter can be considered as a variation parameter which its values can be obtained from comparison of theoretical and experimental results .",
