    "<S> each cell provides data service for its users so as to maintain a target quality - of - service ( qos ) . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , irrespective the presence of maximum power limit or its value , operating at full load is optimal . </S>",
    "<S> we perform energy minimization by optimizing the association between user equipments ( ues ) and cells via selecting cell - specific offsets on lpns . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the optimization problem is proved to be @xmath0-hard . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a tabu search algorithm for offset optimization ( tso ) . for each offset </S>",
    "<S> , tso computes the optimal power solution such that all cells operate at full load . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of tso on optimizing the sum transmission energy , compared to the conventional solution where uniform offset is used for all lpns . </S>"
