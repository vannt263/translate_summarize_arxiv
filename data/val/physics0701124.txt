    "such a medium can be regarded as a sparse distribution of tiny solid - like targets , a peculiar configuration that allows for a deep penetration of the laser radiation and a strong laser - matter coupling with many individual , overdense targets : this guarantees an extremely efficient absorption of the radiation ( nearly the entire laser energy deposited within a few millimeters propagation length @xcite ) .    when an ultraintense laser beam hits a cluster , the leading edge of the pulse promptly ionizes the neutral atoms ( cf .",

    "fluids * 7 * pp . 981 - 987 ( 1964 ) ] . for small , low - z clusters ( e.g. , nm - sized hydrogen or deuterium clusters ) exposed to extremely intense laser radiation , the electrons can even be completely stripped from the cluster in a few optical cycles , leading to the coulomb explosion ( ce ) of the remaining bare - ion distribution . with ir lasers , this happens when the excursion length of the electrons [ @xmath2 , with @xmath3 and @xmath4 as central frequency and normalized vector potential of the laser , respectively ] is much higher than both the electron skin depth ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the electron plasma frequency ) and the initial radius of the cluster , @xmath7 @xcite . in more general situations , when a relevant fraction of the electrons is bound to the cluster , the expansion process is strongly dependent on the self - consistent dynamics of ions and trapped electrons : when increasing the laser energy or when lowering the cluster size , the expansion conditions vary smoothly from quasi - neutral , hydrodynamic - like regimes to pure ce regimes , as revealed by particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations @xcite of laser - cluster interactions and detailed kinetic analysis of the expansion @xcite .",
    "this suggests the possibility of exploiting the electron dynamics in order to achieve control over the expansion , which can be done by appropriately shaping the laser pulses .",
    "for example , large - scale shock shells ( multi - branched structures in the ion phase space , previously predicted by kaplan , dubetsky , and shkolnikov @xcite for nonuniform ces ) can be driven and controlled by using a proper sequence of two laser pulses having different intensities @xcite ; this opens the way toward intracluster fusion reactions within large deuterium or deuterium - tritium clusters @xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "after briefly introducing the concept of shock shells in a coulomb explosion ( sec .",
    "[ sec : shocks ] ) , the description of a double - pump irradiation scheme ( sec .",
    "[ sec : double - pump ] ) for inducing and controlling shock shells capable of driving intracluster nuclear reactions ( sec .",

    "[ sec : ergodic ] ) : selected results obtained with this model are presented in sec . [ sec : results ] .",
    "the explosion dynamics of a spherical distribution of cold ions is described by the equation for the radial motion of the ions , @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the trajectory of an ion starting at @xmath10 from radius @xmath11 with zero radial velocity , @xmath12 is the ion mass , @xmath13 is the ion charge , and @xmath14 is the number of ions enveloped at time @xmath15 by a sphere of radius @xmath16 .    when starting from a uniform ion density ( equal to @xmath17 for @xmath18 ) , the repulsive electric field grows linearly for @xmath19 , reaching its maximum at the outer boundary ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uni_vs_nonuni]a ) , and causing the outer ions to be always faster than the inner ones . in such a particular situation",
    ", ions never overtake each other , @xmath14 is conserved along the ion trajectories ( so is the total energy of each ion ) , and eq . can be integrated analytically @xcite : assuming all ions to be initially at rest , the expansion velocity @xmath20 is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ( initial ) ion plasma frequency , whereas its radial trajectory is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the expansion factor . since the right - hand side of eq . does not depend on @xmath11 , @xmath25 is the same for all ions , being a function of time only , i.e. , @xmath26 . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath27 phase - space profile is always a straight line [ having equation @xmath28 and the ion density stays always uniform ( evolving as @xmath29 ) . correspondingly , the ion energy distribution is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the asymptotic cutoff energy .",
    "such solutions could be obtained equivalently from cold - fluid equations ( @xmath32 being now the fluid velocity ) . however , when nonuniform density profiles are considered , the kinetic aspects of the process immediately reveal themselves and the features of the expansion change dramatically , as first predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite , and explored in self - consistent simulations in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fact , if the initial density is a decreasing function of @xmath16 , the repulsive coulomb field reaches its maximum within the ion sphere @xcite ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : uni_vs_nonuni]b ) , causing some inner ions to accelerate more than the outer ions in front of them : this ultimately leads to overtaking between ions and the formation of a shock shell .",
    "in this situation , the ion trajectories are no longer independent of one another , @xmath14 is not conserved along the ion trajectories ( nor is the total energy of each ion ) , and eq . no longer admits the analytical solutions reported above .",
    "figure [ fig : shock ] shows a typical nonuniform expansion ( similar to that illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",
    "1 ) , starting from the smoothly - decreasing profile of fig .",
    "[ fig : uni_vs_nonuni]b : the phase - space profile starts bending on the right until it becomes multivalued , and a pronounced three - branched shock shell forms ( cf .",
    "[ fig : shock]a ) . as predicted by the theory @xcite , vertical - tangent points in the phase - space profile correspond to a singularity in the ion density ( cf .",
    "[ fig : shock]b ) ( such singularity is sometimes called a caustic @xcite , using a term borrowed from astrophysics @xcite ) , while horizontal - tangent points correspond to a singularity in the energy distribution ( cf . fig . [",
    "fig : shock]c ) ; this appears at the very beginning of the expansion and it is sometimes called the shock predictor @xcite , since it indicates the presence of a maximum in the velocity profile .",
    "as the expansion continues , the shock shell widens radially , involving an ever larger portion of the ion cloud .",
    "the physical interest of such pronounced , large - scale shock shells resides in the appearance of large relative velocities within a single exploding cluster , which can lead to energetic ion - ion collisions , thus opening the way to intracluster nuclear fusion reactions @xcite",
    "( e.g. , in the case of d or d - t clusters ) .",
    "an efficient strategy for producing large - scale shock shells in a controlled fashion is the combination of different expansion regimes .",
    "in fact , if a slow , hydrodynamic - like expansion is exploited to provide a decreasing density profile , then a subsequent , abrupt ce naturally leads to the formation of a shock shell , according to the dynamics described in sec . [",
    "sec : shocks ] .",
    "such a slow - expansion / abrupt - explosion dynamics can be obtained rather simply , by irradiating a cluster with two sequential pulses having different intensities , namely , a weaker pulse followed ( after a proper time delay ) by a much stronger one , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "the first pulse must be intense enough to ionize the atoms , creating a nanoplasma , but no so intense as to expel a significant fraction of the electrons from the cluster core : in these conditions , a slow expansion takes place , in a quasineutral , hydrodynamic - like regime , and a smoothly decreasing density profile is formed .",
    "the second pulse must be extremely intense , in order to strip all the electrons from the cluster , thus driving a ce .",
    "the effectiveness of this double - pump technique has been demonstrated @xcite by resorting to 2d and 3d pic simulations performed using the osiris 2.0 framework @xcite , closely matching realistic physical scenarios .",
    "the results presented in figs . [ fig : sim_2d_dens_all ] and [ fig : sim_2d_phase ] refer to a 2d simulation , in which a deuterium cluster ( initial radius @xmath33 nm , density @xmath34 @xmath35 ) is first irradiated by a relatively weak laser pulse ( peak intensity @xmath36 @xmath37 , duration 35 fs , wavelength @xmath38 nm ) and , after a @xmath39 fs delay , it is irradiated by a second , extremely intense pulse ( peak intensity @xmath40 @xmath37 , duration @xmath41 fs , wavelength @xmath38 nm ) ; both pulses propagate in the @xmath42 direction , being linearly polarized along the @xmath43 direction .",
    "figures [ fig : sim_2d_dens_all ] and [ fig : sim_2d_phase ] show the evolution of the ion density distribution and the ion phase - space profile , respectively , during the ce stage . when the second pulse hits the plasma sphere ( cf .",
    "[ fig : sim_2d_dens_all]a ) , the outer ions are expanding slowly , under the pressure of the hot electrons , while the cluster core is still dense , with the inner ions still at rest ( cf . fig . [",
    "fig : sim_2d_phase ] ) . as a result , when the electrons are suddenly swept away by the second laser , the inner ions experience a much higher repulsive force than the outer ions do , so that they rapidly overrun them , leading to the formation of a large , pronounced shock shell , clearly visible in both ion density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_2d_dens_all]a ) and phase space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sim_2d_phase ] ) . in this example",
    ", the relative velocities between ions belonging to different branches in the shock shell would allow for collision energies as high as @xmath44 kev , which is enough for efficient dd fusion to occur .",
    "the ability of generating pronounced shock shells involving high relative velocities within single exploding clusters makes the phenomenon attractive as a possible way to induce nuclear reactions . as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the rates for intracluster reactions can be much higher than those for intercluster reactions , because the typical densities within a shock shell ( @xmath45 @xmath46 ) can be much higher than those within the hot plasma filament resulting from the exploded clusters , whose density is @xmath47 @xmath46 . however , it is crucial to consider also that a shock shell stays appreciably dense only for a very brief time ( @xmath48 fs ) , much shorter than the typical disassembly time of the plasma filament ( @xmath49 ps ) .",
    "in fact , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the intracluster - reaction rates exhibit a sharp , time - resolved peak right after the shock - shell formation .",
    "in order to compute the actual number of shock - driven , intracluster fusion reactions , it is necessary to sum up all possible contributions from collisions between ions belonging to different velocity branches .",
    "the number of reactions per unit time and volume , @xmath50 , is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the cross section for dd fusion , while @xmath53 and @xmath54 indicate , respectively , the ion density and velocity on the @xmath55th branch .",
    "the number of intracluster fusion reactions , @xmath56 , is obtained by integrating @xmath50 over time and space , as @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the shock shell boundaries , whereas @xmath60 is the shock formation time . clearly , @xmath56 is strongly dependent on the dynamics of the shock shell , which can be tailored by varying the delay between the two laser pulses as well as their intensities .",
    "a detailed analysis of the influence of the double - pump parameters on the intracluster fusion rate ( cf . ref .",
    "@xcite ) reveals that optimal delay / intensity combinations exist that maximize @xmath56 .",
    "for very large clusters ( @xmath61 nm ) and optimal double - pump configuration , the intracluster reaction yield can become comparable with the interluster neutron yield , with @xmath62 of the fusion reactions arising from intracluster collisions @xcite .",
    "since intercluster reactions occur on a much longer time scale than intracluster ones ( @xmath50 is sharply peaked in time @xcite ) , a well tuned double - pump experiment should provide a clear signature for the occurrence of intracluster , shock - driven fusion reactions , in the form of a time - resolved burst of fusion neutrons anticipating the usual bulk of fusion neutrons due to intercluster reactions .",
    "the possible use of the double - pump technique also with vuv / x - ray radiation is currently being investigated . with very short wavelengths ,",
    "the expulsion of electrons from the cluster , which is necessary for a coulomb explosion to occur , depends essentially on the ionization dynamics and much less on the electron motion in the radiation field [ since now the electron excursion length ( @xmath63 ) is very small compared to the typical cluster radius ] .",
    "thus , the full details of the ionization processes involved in this situation ( e.g. , photoionization , auger decay , collisional ionization , and strong field ionization ) must be considered .",
    "for example , when the main ionization process is the photoelectric effect ( as in d clusters ) , the mean energy acquired by the electrons is approximately equal to the photon energy , @xmath64 .",
    "a coulomb explosion can occur if the number of photons hitting the cluster is sufficient to ionize most of the atoms , and @xmath65 is higher than the electrostatic potential well generated by the ions .",
    "this suggests that a double - pump technique can still be employed to drive a shock shell , even though the physical mechanisms it relies on are different .",
    "in fact , the goal of the first , weak pulse is now to ionize a small fraction of the atoms in the cluster , in order to drive a slow expansion , whereas the second , strong pulse must ionize all the atoms remaining in the cluster core , causing a sudden explosion . in these conditions , a shock shell forms because some of the ions created by the second pulse overtake the slowly expanding ions , provided that appropriate radiation intensities and delay between pulses are employed .    in order to test the effectiveness of this technique , pic simulations have been used @xcite , which describe the evolution of the cluster given the initial distributions for the electron and ion populations .",
    "this approach is valid whenever the ionization time is short with respect to the expansion time scale , which is usually a good approximation for the intense light sources available in the vuv / x - ray energy range .",
    "the formation of a pronounced shock shell , obtained using this technique , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xdouble ] , referring to an ideal situation in which it is assumed that a deuterium cluster ( initial radius @xmath66 nm , density @xmath67 @xmath46 ) undergoes ionization processes which lead to the formation of a population of @xmath68 electrons ( where @xmath69 is the number of initially neutral atoms ) with 12.4 kev energy , followed by a second population of @xmath70 electrons with equal energy , after a 150 fs delay .",
    "we observe that at ultra high intensities in xuv / x - ray sources the ionization dynamics is poorly understood since strong field ionization and stabilization against this mechanism may come into play @xcite .",
    "the balance between the photoelectric , strong field ionization and stabilization processes must be analyzed in order to obtain the correct picture for the energy distribution of the electrons ( which actually determines the dynamics of the explosion ) .",
    "the analysis of double - pump scenarios , taking into account the full dynamics of ionization , with beam configurations available at lcls and xfel and with different cluster constituents will be presented in future publications .",
    "the possibility of controlling the expansion by acting on the amount of energy transferred from the radiation to the electrons stresses the need for a deep understanding of the physics of the electron - driven collisionless expansion of spherical , nm - sized plasmas , composed of cold ions and hot electrons .",
    "this is also crucial for particular applications , such as the biomolecular imaging with ultrashort x - ray pulses @xcite , where sample damage before the imaging time must be avoided .",
    "since the first experiments on laser - cluster interactions were performed @xcite , it has been debated @xcite whether the cluster expansions were driven mainly by the pressure of the hot electrons ( hydrodynamic - like regime ) or by the strong repulsive field which forms when a large fraction of the electrons leave the ion core ( ce ) .",
    "actually , these two expansion regimes are just two opposite limits resulting from the same physical process , namely the formation of a repulsive electric field due to energetic electrons trying to escape from the cold - ion core .",
    "when the kinetic energy of the electrons is very small compared to the electrostatic energy stored in the ion core , the electric field is localized at the ion front @xcite , the whole cluster being approximately neutral , and the expansion is hydrodynamic - like ; on the contrary , when the kinetic energy of the electrons is much higher than the ion electrostatic energy , most of the electrons are free to escape and the ce of the ion sphere takes place .",
    "however , in a general scenario , the dynamics will be a mixture of the phenomenology of the two limits , and a kinetic description is necessary in order to capture the detailed features of each particular regime .      in order to analyze accurately the dynamics of the expansion in any intermediate situation , we have developed a new kinetic model , which allows for a clear identification of the transition from the hydrodynamic expansion to the ce regime , thus setting the range of validity for the ce approximation @xcite . based on the assumptions",
    "that the electrons are nonrelativistic and that the time scale for their motion is much shorter than the time scale for the ion motion , the model describes the expansion dynamics self - consistently by following the radial motion of the ions , whereas treating the evolution of the electron distribution as a sequence of equilibrium configurations , represented by stationary solutions of the vlasov equation for the electrons . in the case of ideal , spherical symmetry , the general stationary solution is a function of the hamiltonian @xmath71 and of the absolute value of the angular momentum , @xmath72 , which are constants of motion of the system .",
    "however , and by noticing that possible perturbations to the spherical symmetry would rapidly break the @xmath72-conservation , while leaving the @xmath71-conservation unaltered , the distribution function in equilibrium can be assumed to depend on @xmath71 only , i.e. , the system can be assumed to be ergodic .",
    "accordingly , the electron density in equilibrium with the electrostatic potential @xmath73 can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the energy distribution of the electrons and @xmath76^{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\text{d}r}^{\\prime } } \\label{eq : p}\\ ] ] is the probability of finding an electron having total energy @xmath77 at the radial position @xmath16 .",
    "the self - consistent potential @xmath73 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath78 , which is nonlinear because @xmath79 depends on @xmath73 . in order to obtain a closed set of equations describing the plasma expansion ,",
    "one still needs a rule to update the equilibrium configuration when the ion motion is considered . since the variations of @xmath73 induced by the ion motion are slow when compared with the time scale for the electron motion , the theory of adiabatic invariants for time varying hamiltonians is used . here",
    ", the appropriate invariant is the ergodic invariant ( cf .",
    ", for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath80 which is the phase - space volume enclosed by the surface @xmath81 .",
    "the conservation of @xmath82 means that the energy variation can be expressed as the ensemble average of the potential - energy variation , thus providing the desired rule for the evolution of the electron energy .",
    "finally , a closed set of equations can be written in the form @xmath83 where eqs . and ,",
    "determining the evolution of the ion trajectories @xmath9 and the electron energies @xmath84 ( @xmath85 being the initial energy ) , are coupled with the nonlinear poisson equation , which provides the self - consistent @xmath86 ( here , @xmath73 is set to zero at infinity , so that @xmath87 for trapped electrons ) . in eq .",

    "( 8) requires the knowledge of @xmath91 and @xmath89 . depending on the physical problem considered",
    ", the determination of @xmath89 can be nontrivial .",
    "this is precisely the case when considering expansions starting from an initially neutral distribution ( @xmath92 , and @xmath93 everywhere ) with hot maxwellian electrons , having temperature @xmath94 , because such configuration is far from equilibrium . in that case",
    ", the plasma expansion can be regarded as a sequence of two distinct processes : first , a rapid expansion of the electrons is observed , which leads to a vp equilibrium configuration before the ions move appreciably ; second , a slow expansion of the plasma bulk is observed . while the latter stage can be certainly analyzed using eqs .",
    "( 8) , a different procedure must be used to determine the equilibrium configuration following the first stage [ in order to obtain the correct form of @xmath89 ] .",
    "to this purpose , the actual charging transient described by the full vp model is replaced by a virtual charging transient , in which an external potential barrier , initially confining the electrons , is gradually moved from @xmath7 to infinity , with a series of small radial displacements .",
    "each time the barrier is moved farther ( from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ) , the new self - consistent potential ( @xmath98 ) and electron energy ( @xmath99 ) have to be calculated . in order to mimic an expansion into a vacuum ( which the real transient is )",
    ", direct energy exchanges between the electrons and the expanding barrier ( expansion work ) must be avoided .",
    "this is accomplished by expressing the energy variation @xmath100 as @xmath101 although formally identical to eq . , eq . is not equivalent to the conservation of the ergodic invariant ( which would bring on an extra term in the expression for @xmath100 , accounting for the expansion work ) .",
