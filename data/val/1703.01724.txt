    "hence the model satisfy all the physical plausibility conditions .",
    "the stability of the stellar configuration has been checked via herrera s cracking method , the trend in the adiabatic index , @xmath159 and the harrison - zeldovich - novikov stability criterion . from fig .",
    "9 clearly shows that the stellar configuration satisfies null energy condition , weak energy condition and strong energy condition .",
    "10 shows surface redshift is also well behaved .",
    "the compactification factor @xmath160 is displayed in table 1 . from the table",
    "it is clear that our model is in good agreement with the most recent observational data of pulsars given by gangopadhyay _ et .",
    "al._@xcite .",
    "hence our model is stable , satisfies all the physical plausibility conditions and is useful to describe compact stars like vela x-1 and 4u1608 - 52 .    in summary",
    ", we began with a static spherically symmetric metric and imposed the karmarkar condition which is a necessary condition for a metric to be of embedding class 1 .",
    "the karmarkar condition reduces the problem of finding solutions of the einstein field equations to a single - generating function . if we further require that the interior matter distribution of the star be described by a perfect fluid then the only possible configuration is the schwarzschild uniform density sphere .",
    "it is well - known that this solution leads to infinite propagation speeds within the stellar core . in order to generate a physically viable model of a compact star , we chose a metric potential which is singularity - free and well - behaved throughout the stellar interior .",
    "we are in a position to integrate the karmarkar condition to produce a closed form for the remaining metric potential .",
    "we have demonstrated that this solution satisfies all the requirements for a stable , matter configuration in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "our model displays a great degree of robustness in approximating observable compact objects .",
