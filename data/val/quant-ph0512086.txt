    "experiments of atoms optics have discovered the new phenomenon of `` quantum accelerator modes '' @xcite .",
    "a subsequently formulated theory@xcite shows that these modes correspond to stable periodic orbits of the formally classical dynamical system , that is defined on the 2-torus by the map : @xmath1 this map is a variant of the standard map , to which it reduces for @xmath2 , and its periodic orbits will be characterized in this paper by two integers @xmath3 so that @xmath4 is the period and @xmath5 is the winding number `` in the @xmath6 direction '' .",
    "it should be mentioned that ( [ map1 ] ) does _ not _ emerge from the classical limit @xmath7 of the atomic dynamics ; and also that the quantum accelerator modes are unrelated to the well known accelerator modes of the standard map@xcite , because they do _ not _ result of multiples of @xmath8 being accumulated by an orbit as it winds around the torus in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "in fact they also arise of orbits with @xmath9 , and their origin is subtler ; we defer the interested reader to ref.@xcite .",
    "the modes reported in @xcite correspond to orbits with @xmath10 ; however , the theory predicts that also orbits with higher @xmath4 should give rise to accelerator modes ; and such `` higher order '' modes were indeed observed in subsequent experiments@xcite .",
    "this opened the way to `` accelerator mode spectroscopy '' , _",
    "i.e. _ systematic classification of modes according to their numbers @xmath3 .",
    "then the question arose , which winding ratios @xmath5 correspond to observable modes , and why .",
    "the answer to this question has been recently announced@xcite and is presented in full technical detail in the present paper .",
    "we show that the accelerator modes bear an analogy to the widely studied mode - locking phenomenon , which is observed in a variety of classical mechanical systems@xcite .",
    "this analogy includes important aspects such as the arnold tongues , and the farey organisation thereof . at the same time , the present problem has significant differences from well known instances of mode - locking in the physical literature , such as , e.g. , those which are reducible to the circle map@xcite . these differences stem from the fact that ( [ map1 ] ) is a non - dissipative ( in fact hamiltonian ) dynamical system .",
    "+ in this paper these issues are analyzed in detail , thus providing a backbone for the results announced in @xcite .",
    "we develop a perturbation theory for the tongues near their vertex , and a heuristic analysis for the `` critical region '' where they break . based on such results we describe and explain the farey - like arithmetical regularities that emerge from classification of the observed quantum modes , and",
    "show that such regularities are encoded by the arithmetical process , of constructing suitable sequences of rational approximants to a real number , which is just the gravity acceleration ( measured in appropriate units ) .",
    "+ our perturbative analysis exposes a formal relation to the classical wannier - stark problem of a particle subject to a constant field plus a sinusoidal field .",
    "this relation has quantum mechanical implications , which are discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper consists of two parts . in the 1st of these ( sections [ phd],[setup ] , [ tgs ] ) we perform analytical and numerical analysis of the tongues .",
    "based on these results , in the 2nd part ( section [ spect ] ) we turn to connections to experiments .",
    "the most technical aspects are deferred to appendices .",
    "the `` phase diagram '' in fig.[fig : tongues ] shows the regions of existence of several stable periodic orbits with different @xmath3 in the plane of the parameters @xmath11 .",
    "the origin of stable periodic orbits of ( [ map1 ] ) associated with any couple @xmath3 of mutually prime integers is easily understood . for rational @xmath12 and @xmath13 ,",
    "the map has circles of period-@xmath4 points . as generically predicted by the poincar - birkhoff argument @xcite , at nonzero @xmath14 these circles",
    "are destroyed , and yet an even number of period-@xmath4 points , half of which are stable , survive in their vicinity . at sufficiently small @xmath15",
    "such stable periodic orbits exist in whole albeit small intervals of values of @xmath16 around @xmath5 .",
    "exactly this fact gives birth to the experimentally observed accelerator modes ; indeed , a stable @xmath17 orbit of ( [ map1 ] ) with @xmath16 in the vicinity of @xmath5 gives rise to a quantum accelerator mode , whose physical acceleration is proportional to @xmath18 ( @xcite ; see also sect.[spect ] ) .",
    "the persistence of a given winding ratio @xmath5 in a whole region of the space of parameters @xmath19 is where an analogy to the `` mode locking '' may be seen . as shown in fig.[fig : tongues ] , near the @xmath13 axis these regions ( `` tongues '' ) turn out in the shape of wedges , with vertices at @xmath20 .",
    "the wedges exhibit , at their vertex , an angle , and not a cusp , as is instead the case , e.g. with the circle map , and with systems that reduce to it due to dissipation@xcite . moving to higher @xmath14 inside a tongue ,",
    "the periodic orbit turns unstable , causing the wedge to break and ramify .",
    "bifurcations follow , which give rise to swallow - like structures .",
    "such `` critical structures '' of different tongues intertwine and overlap in complicated ways .",
    "a tongue is usually overlapped by others , even before breaking , so stable orbits with different @xmath3 coexist ; according to numerical computations , such overlaps persist at very small values of @xmath14 , marking one more difference to the usual scenario . it should be noted that higher - period tongues in fig.[fig : tongues ] hide lower - period ones , and this concurs with graphical and numerical resolution in effacing much of the fine structure of the critical regions .    ) , showing the regions of existence and stability ( `` tongues '' ) of several periodic orbits with different @xmath17 .",
    "the thick dotted black lines represent the locus of the parameter values used in experiments .",
    "the dashed black lines show the perturbative theoretical prediction ( [ bord ] ) for the margins of a tongue.,width=755 ]",
    "we consider the case when @xmath21 is small , and @xmath16 is close to a rational number @xmath5 , with @xmath22 mutually prime integers . we then write @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a small parameter .",
    "the sign of @xmath25 and @xmath24 is arbitrary , and @xmath26 may be assumed nonnegative with no limitation of generality . by working out canonical perturbation theory at 1st order in @xmath24 ,",
    "we determine the finite angle at the vertex of the @xmath3 tongue , and obtain an estimate for the area of the stable islands .",
    "the whole procedure is an adaptation of chirikov s classic analysis @xcite , and for @xmath2 our results reproduce well - known ones for the standard map .      to open the way to a hamiltonian formulation , we first of all remove mod@xmath27 from the 1st eqn . in ( [ map1 ] ) and thereby translate ( [ map1 ] ) into a map of the cylinder parametrized by @xmath28 on itself .",
    "doing so , period-@xmath4 points on the torus are turned into non - periodic points on the cylinder , due to the constant drift @xmath29 in the 1st eqn . in ( [ map1 ] ) , which is not any more suppressed by mod@xmath27 . for this reason we change variables to @xmath30 and thus obtain : @xmath31 this defines a map @xmath32 which explicitly depends on the `` time '' @xmath33 .",
    "however , @xmath34 , so , denoting @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the map @xmath37 is defined as in @xmath38 and does not depend on @xmath33 any more .",
    "the search for period-@xmath4 points of ( [ map1 ] ) is thus reduced to search for period-@xmath39 points of @xmath40 . for @xmath41 , these fill the circles @xmath42 , where @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the characteristic function of the even integers .",
    "we next write ( [ periodp ] ) at 1st order in @xmath24 in the form of a canonical map that affords implementation of canonical perturbation theory .",
    "it is easily seen that , at 1st order in @xmath24 , the map @xmath40 writes : @xmath45 where @xmath46 the sums @xmath47 are a generalized version of the gauss sums that are studied in number theory .",
    "they play an important role in the present problem , and their moduli and arguments will be denoted @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , omitting the specification of @xmath4 and @xmath50 whenever not strictly necessary .",
    "the map ( [ noncan ] ) is not a canonical one , but may be turned canonical , at the cost of higher order corrections only , by replacing @xmath51 by @xmath52 in the 2nd equation . to show this we note that the function @xmath53 generates a canonical transformation @xmath54 , given in implicit form by @xmath55 provided that the 1st equation may be uniquely solved for @xmath52",
    "this is indeed the case whenever @xmath56 is a numerical constant of order unity .",
    "this follows from @xmath57 ) in appendix [ gausssum ] .",
    "it is easily seen that replacing @xmath52 by @xmath51 in the argument of @xmath58 in ( [ finmap ] ) exactly yields ( [ noncan ] ) . as @xmath58 is scaled by @xmath24",
    ", this replacement involves an error of higher order than the 1st .      at 1st order in @xmath24 , the map ( [ finmap ] ) may be assumed to describe the evolution associated with the time - dependent , `` kicked '' hamiltonian @xmath59 from immediately _ before _ one kick to immediately _ before _ the next one .",
    "this hamiltonian is a multi - valued function on the cylinder , however multi - valuedness disappears on taking derivatives in the hamilton equations , and so ( [ ham ] ) uniquely determines a `` locally hamiltonian '' flow .",
    "we change variable to @xmath60 and drop inessential constants , as well as corrections of higher order in @xmath24 ; and then , in order to remove explicit time dependence , we move into an extended phase space with canonical variables @xmath61 , and therein consider the time - independent floquet hamiltonian : @xmath62 the variable @xmath63 is the phase of the periodic driving , and changes in time according to @xmath64 . in particular , eqn.([finmap ] ) is obtained with @xmath65 .",
    "we consider ( [ floq ] ) as a perturbation , scaled by @xmath24 , of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath66 points with @xmath67 ( cp.([resval ] ) ) and arbitrary @xmath68 , are fixed under the evolution generated by @xmath69 in unit time . for @xmath70",
    "a 2-parameter family parametrized by @xmath71 survive near @xmath72 .",
    "these points may be analyzed by standard methods of classical perturbation theory @xcite in the vicinity of each resonant value @xmath72 of the action @xmath73 .",
    "this calculation is reviewed in appendix [ resonant ] .",
    "the final result is that , for sufficiently small @xmath74 , and near each resonant action @xmath72 , the motion in the @xmath75 space is canonically conjugate at 1st order in @xmath24 to the motion described by the simple hamiltonian in ( [ pend ] ) below .",
    "this result is achieved by three subsequent canonical transformations .",
    "the first of these removes the oscillating ( @xmath76dependent ) part of the perturbation to higher order in @xmath24 , except for a `` resonant '' part , by moving to appropriate new variables @xmath77 .",
    "the 2nd transformation leads to variables @xmath78 such that the @xmath79 motion is decoupled from the @xmath80 motion .",
    "a final transformation leads to variables @xmath81 such that the 1st order perturbation term in the hamiltonian depends on the angle variable @xmath82 alone .",
    "the final hamiltonian is that of a pendulum with an added linear potential : @xmath83 a previous remark about multi - valuedness of ( [ ham ] ) applies to this hamiltonian , too . in spite of being ill - defined on the cylinder",
    ", it defines a locally hamiltonian flow . replacing the angle @xmath84 by a linear coordinate turns ( [ pend ] ) into the wannier - stark ( classical ) hamiltonian for a particle moving in a line , under the combined action of a constant field and of a sinusoidal static field @xcite .",
    "relations between the present problem and the wannier - stark problem are discussed in @xcite .",
    "equilibrium ( fixed ) points @xmath85 of the hamiltonian ( [ pend ] ) must satisfy @xmath86 hence they only exist if @xmath87 , or , equivalently , @xmath88 under strict inequality , ( [ equi ] ) has two solutions , and one of them is stable .",
    "the presence of higher - order corrections , ( which were dismissed along the way from ( [ periodp ] ) to ( [ pend ] ) ) turns the dynamics from integrable to quasi - integrable , so , assuming a conventional kam scenario , one may predict a stable orbit of ( [ periodp ] ) near each resonant action @xmath72 , for sufficiently small @xmath89 . in order to determine the equilibrium points in the original variables ,",
    "one may work backwards the canonical transformations specified in appendix [ resonant ] and in the end recall @xmath90 ; or else one may directly solve for the fixed points of ( [ finmap ] ) at the 1st order in @xmath24 . in either case one",
    "has to use formulae ( [ dodd ] ) and ( [ deven ] ) in appendix [ gausssum ] .",
    "it is then found that @xmath91 the phases @xmath92 were computed in closed form by number - theoretic means by hannay and berry@xcite . a chain of @xmath4 fixed points of period @xmath4",
    "are then obtained for the original map ( [ map1 ] ) on the torus . for small @xmath24 ,",
    "these points belong to a single primitive periodic orbit of ( [ map1 ] ) , because they result of a continuous displacement , scaled by @xmath24 , of points in a primitive periodic orbit of ( [ map1 ] ) for @xmath41 . in the @xmath93 phase diagram , ( [ bord ] )",
    "is satisfied in a region bounded by two half - lines originating at @xmath94 . at small @xmath95",

    "are straight lines through the vertex of the @xmath17 tongue .",
    "the axis of the tongue corresponds to @xmath112 and the side margins to @xmath113 , so condition ( [ bord ] ) is equivalent to @xmath114 .",

    "it monotonically decreases from @xmath119 to @xmath120 as @xmath117 increases from @xmath120 to @xmath39 , and near these endpoints it behaves like : @xmath121 thus , along lines drawn through the vertex of a tongue , and sufficiently close to the vertex , @xmath109 decreases proportional to @xmath122 . the estimate ( [ area ] ) and the asymptotics ( [ asy ] ) are well confirmed by direct numerical estimation of areas of stable islands of ( [ map1 ] ) , as shown in figs [ fig : ham ] , [ fig : varom ] , [ fig : area - k ] .",
    "a crude upper bound for the validity of perturbative analysis is set by overlapping between islands , belonging in the same mode and in neighbouring modes as well .",

    ". the logarithmic corrections in ( [ crit1]),([bd ] ) are likely to be artifacts of our derivation ; in any case , both bounds have nearly the same dependence on the period @xmath4 as predicted by the `` overlapping criterion '' .",

    "the area of stable islands first increases up to a maximal value , and then it decreases through strong oscillations ( fig.[fig : area - k ] ) .",

    "the latter are generated by continuously varying _ a single _ control parameter : the pulse period @xmath140 ( or , equivalently , @xmath24 ) in ranges close to the resonant values @xmath185 .",
    "the locus of the corresponding points in the @xmath160 plane is then a continuous curve , that will be termed the experimental path ( ep ) in the following .",
    "the problem then arises , of classifying the tongues , that have a significant intersection with a given ep .",
    "these are but a small subclass of the farey family of tongues that fits the given interaction time , because many tongues in that family are met by the ep in their overcritical regions , where islands are typically small , yielding hardly if at all detectable modes . thus the analysis of observable modes rests on three key facts .",
    "the first of these is existence of a critical border ( sect.[crit ] ) .",
    "second , an ep hits the @xmath13 axis at a value of @xmath16 given by @xmath186 , which corresponds to @xmath41 , or @xmath187 .",
    "third , the quantum dynamics grow more and more quasi-@xmath24-classical as @xmath13 is approached along an ep , and this justifies analysis based on the @xmath24-classical phase diagram .",
    "these three facts reduce the problem of predicting the observable modes to a number - theoretic problem , of constructing suitable sequences of rational approximants to the real number @xmath188 .",
    "if space is measured in units of the spatial period of the kicks , and time in units of @xmath185 , then @xmath188 is just the gravity acceleration .",

    "the experiments in @xcite will be used as a model case in this section , and the corresponding eps are shown by the black dotted lines in fig.[fig : tongues ] .",
    "each choice of @xmath192 yields an ep consisting of two lines which will be henceforth referred to as the two `` arms '' of the ep .",

    "+ independently of the specific form of @xmath198 , the intersection of an ep with the subcritical @xmath17 tongue is defined by two conditions , one dictated by ( [ bord ] ) , and the other by the critical border @xmath199 with @xmath200 : @xmath201 these inequalities lead to @xmath202 and show that the winding ratios @xmath155 that are observed along an ep have to approximate @xmath188 the better , the smaller @xmath24 .      according to ( [ appro ] ) , the winding ratios of modes oberved along an ep form a sequence of rational approximants to @xmath188 .",
    "this fact was already noted in @xcite , and the question arose , which of the densely many rational winding ratios that lie arbitrarily close to @xmath188 are actually observable .",
    "the farey rule may be used to answer this question .",
    "modes are the more visible , the smaller their order ; therefore , modes observed on moving along an ep towards @xmath188 should achieve better and better approximations to @xmath188 , at the least possible cost in terms of their orders @xmath4 .",
    "issues of criticality , and of quasi-@xmath24-classicality , additionally suggest that , as a thumb rule , modes should be more safely observable near the vertex of their tongues .",
    "these indications suggest the following construction . assuming that @xmath16 ranges in the interval @xmath165 $ ] , the strongest modes are the period-@xmath39 ones , @xmath138 and @xmath203 . according to the farey rule in the end of sect.[frule ] ,",
    "the next strongest mode is associated with their farey mediant , @xmath204 . at the next step two further farey mediants @xmath205 and @xmath206 appear .",
    "the former is closer to @xmath207 than the latter , so its tongue intersects the ep at lower @xmath74 .",
    "it is therefore expected to produce a stronger mode ; so we discard @xmath208 , and restrict to the interval @xmath209 $ ]",
    ". the process may then be iterated . at the @xmath33-th step ,",
    "it will have singled out two rationals , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , such that the _ farey interval _ @xmath212",
    "$ ] contains @xmath188 , but does not contain any rational with a divisor smaller than @xmath213 . if @xmath188 is itself a rational , then it is eventually obtained as the farey mediant of the endpoints of a farey interval @xmath214 , and then the process terminates .",
    "the process just described is an arithmetic recursion for generating rational approximants to @xmath188 , that will be termed here `` the farey algorithm '' . out of all possible rational approximants to @xmath188 , it selects the endpoints of the farey intervals of @xmath188 , as the winding ratios whose prediction is safer .",
    "it is now necessary to discuss consistency of the farey algorithm with the key condition ( [ appro ] ) , that dictates the rate at which modes of increasing order @xmath4 have to approximate the gravity acceleration @xmath188 .",
    "this rate depends on the form of the function @xmath198 ; however , in no case it is required to be faster than quadratic , thanks to the 1st term on the rhs of ( [ appro ] ) .",
    "for this reason , observation of the principal convergents ( or simply the convergents ) to @xmath188 is always expected .",
    "these are the rationals @xmath215 that are obtained by truncating the continued fraction of @xmath188 , and are `` best rational approximants '' to @xmath188 in the sense that ( thm.182 in @xcite , p.151 ) : @xmath216 they are known to satisfy @xmath217 , and hence ( [ appro ] ) as well , and are in fact clearly detected in experiments and in numerical simulations .",
    "the farey algorithm generates all of the convergents to @xmath188 .",
    "as shown in appendix [ falg ] , at least one endpoint of each farey interval is a convergent to @xmath188 ; however , except for quite particular choices of @xmath188 , the farey algorithm generates more approximants than just the convergents , and so a farey interval generated by the algorithm may have only one endpoint given by a convergent . in that case ,",
    "that very convergent is also an endpoint of the next generated interval , and possibly of subsequently generated ones , until the construction produces the next convergent at the other endpoint . by construction , @xmath210 is the rational that yields the best approximation _ from the left _ in the class of all rationals @xmath166 with @xmath218 ; and @xmath211 has the the same property in what concerns approximations from the right . the one of the two approximants @xmath219 that lies closer to @xmath188 is called the _ @xmath33-th farey approximant _ to @xmath188 , and will be denoted @xmath220 .",
    "it is by construction a best rational approximant to @xmath188 , in a weaker sense than ( [ prc ] ) : notably , latexmath:[\\[\\label{farappx }    the approximation of @xmath188 which is granted by a farey approximant may not be quadratic when the approximant is not a convergent ; therefore , whether a farey approximant satisfies condition ( [ appro ] ) depends on the form of the function @xmath198 .",
    "that condition is the more exacting , the steeper the ep , which is the graph of the function @xmath198 .",
    "for instance , in the extreme case when the ep is a vertical line drawn through @xmath188 ( which corresponds to @xmath222 in our model case is constant along such an ep , the gravity acceleration @xmath142 has to vary with @xmath24 .",
    "experimental techniques of creating a variable artificial gravity have been devised@xcite . ] ) , the 2nd term in ( [ appro ] ) is absent and the approximation has to be strictly quadratic .",
    "this may rule out some of the non - principal approximants produced by the algorithm , depending on arithmetical properties of @xmath188 .",
    "for @xmath188 equal to the golden ratio , all the farey endpoints are principal convergents . all the corresponding modes , and none other , were observed in numerical simulations of the atomic dynamics ( fig.[fig : pac ] ) . for a `` less irrational '' choice @xmath223 , the farey algorithm generates many other approximants besides the convergents .",
    "all those with order @xmath224 were detected by our numerical simulations of the atomic dynamics up to @xmath225 pulses , except for two , and these were found to violate ( [ appro ] ) .",
    "+ when the ep is not vertical the 2nd term in ( [ appro ] ) opens the way to non - quadratic approximants . for the ep we consider here ,",
    "this term is given by @xmath226 and prevails over the 1st term at sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "for this reason , according to theorem ( t6 ) in appendix [ falg ] , for almost all @xmath188 ( in the sense of lebesgue measure ) , _ all _ of the farey endpoints , except possibly for finitely many exceptions , satisfy ( [ appro ] ) .",
    "since the 2nd term in ( [ appro ] ) prevails over the @xmath39st the later ( that is , at larger @xmath4 ) , the steeper the ep , ( in our model case , the larger @xmath227 ) , the possible `` finitely many exceptions '' may be relevant in the analysis of data , which of necessity can not extend to arbitrarily large @xmath4 .",
    "+ in conclusion , the farey - based prediction of modes may suffer exceptions , both in the case when the ep is very steep , and in the opposite case when it is very flat , by generating more approximants ( in the former case ) , and less ( in the latter case ) than allowed by ( [ appro ] ) .",
    "in addition , ( [ appro ] ) itself is not exact , as it rests on a coarsely defined critical border . in particular , large fragments of broken tongues , too ,",
    "may produce significant modes at times .",
    "_ left- and right - hand modes .",
    "_ by construction , @xmath228 and @xmath229 approximate @xmath188 from the left and from the right respectively .",
    "therefore , the vertex of the @xmath228 tongue lies on the left of @xmath188 , so the intersection of the tongue with the left arm of the ep lies at significantly lower @xmath14 than its intersection with the right arm ; hence , it should be preferably observed at @xmath151 .",
    "it is in fact an empirical observation , that left ( resp .",
    ", right ) approximants preferably occur at negative ( resp . , positive ) values of @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , two successive convergents to @xmath188 approximate @xmath188 from opposite sides , so the corresponding modes are in principle expected on opposite arms . this is not a strict rule , as tongues with relatively small @xmath4 may have significant intersection with both arms of an ep .",
    "some low - period modes could indeed be observed _ on both _",
    "arms , and were found to correspond to convergents of @xmath188 .",
    "however , this can not happen when the period of a tongue is so large that the slope @xmath230 of its margins is larger than the slope of the arm lying on the opposite side with respect to @xmath188 .",
