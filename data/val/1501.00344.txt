    "the transfer of quantum states from one quantum unit of a quantum computer to another is of fundamental importance in quantum information science . recently , in view of the great potential of a physical realization of the quantum computer , attention is being paid to the problem of the transfer of quantum information in a solid - state system .",
    "recently , spin systems have been proposed as a quantum data bus for transferring information . in a pioneering study  @xcite",
    ", bose showed that the simplest coupled spin chain with uniform nearest - neighbor ( nn ) couplings is able to act as a quantum channel , i.e. , the spin system allows the transmission of an arbitrary quantum state with high fidelity from one end to the other .",
    "the advantages of this protocol are that no external control is required throughout the entire transfer process , the quantum state transfer ( qst ) is equivalent to the natural dynamical evolution of the time - independent hamiltonian , and the system can be isolated from the environment to minimize decoherence . however , the drawback of this proposal is that the transfer quality decreases with the size of chain .",
    "one way to overcome this problem is to precisely modulate the couplings between nn spins throughout the quantum data bus , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite so as to obtain perfect qst , which is independent of the chain length .",
    "this is possible because the eigenvalues of the system match the parity of the corresponding eigenstates , which is a sufficient condition for perfect qst  @xcite .",
    "however , such an implementation requires precise control of the system , which is not desirable in an experiment .",
    "another approach to achieving perfect qst is based on a gap quantum system  cirac , ly1,hmx , xh , cb , lukin , mb , aw0,aw , sp , sl , swap , lb , tj , qi , venuti3,venuti2 . by weakly connecting the transmitting and receiving qubits to a gap system",
    ", the total system s dynamics can be reduced to those of an effective two- or three - level system .",
    "in addition to the fact that no extra controls are required for communication , a key advantage of these methods is their robustness against parameter disorder , which comes from inevitable technological errors in the experimental implementation .",
    "moreover , we notice that the systems with long - range inter - qubit interactions for perfect qst or creating entanglement are well developed as well venuti1,petrosyan , ys , kay , bose3 .    in this paper , we introduce an impurity - induced gapped system ( igs ) , which is a tight - binding chain with on - site energy applied on a single quantum dot ( qd ) , to act as a quantum channel .",
    "we demonstrate the existence of a nonvanishing energy gap between the ground and first - excited states in the single - particle case .",
    "we also investigate the qst using the igs .",
    "it is found that at lower temperatures , the total hamiltonian can be mapped to a _ three - level _ effective hamiltonian whose energy levels are equally spaced and can be used to perform near - perfect qst . in the weak - coupling limit , the coupling constant of the effective hamiltonian has an inverse relationship with the transfer distance .",
    "moreover , we study the robustness of the state transfer against the static imperfections of the couplings , as discussed in ref .",
    "the resulting distribution of the transfer fidelities reveals that chains with boundary states are more resilient to imperfections .",
    "this is reflected in more instances of high - fidelity transfer through the spin chain . compared with previously proposed schemes , the advantage of our scheme is that it is simple and can be readily applied to experiments .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , the model igs is set up and its spectrum is introduced . in section iii , our qst protocol is set up and the effective hamiltonian , @xmath0 , is deduced using perturbation theory . the scheme for using the igs to transfer a quantum state",
    "is discussed in section iv .",

    "hereafter , we shall omit the @xmath11 index , denoting the electron operator with generic spin state as @xmath13 .",
    "this system can be regarded as a spinless fermion system , and the feasibly obtained results can be applied to the original system . in this sense , we can concentrate on the spinless fermion model in the following discussion .",

    "note that the hamiltonian , @xmath16 , commutes with the total number operator , @xmath17 , and so the hilbert space can be decomposed into subspaces corresponding to different particle numbers , @xmath18 .",

    "second , the probability density of all the eigenstates with odd parity in the central site , @xmath3 , is zero , i.e. , @xmath40 , which means that the eigenstates with odd parity are unaffected by the presence of the impurity .",
    "third , by the hellmann - feynman theorem , the eigenvalues of even - parity eigenstates decrease due to the presence of the impurity .",
    "furthermore , the impurity contributes exactly one bound state , which we focus on in this study .    to see more precisely what happens for @xmath41 , we solve eq .",
    "( ba ) via the bethe ansatz method . in this study ,",
    "the bound state is the ground state of @xmath16 . through a straightforward calculation ,",
    "one can obtain the following analytical result for the ground state @xmath42with the eigenvalue @xmath43 , where @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 ; @xmath46 is the renormalization factor .",

    "until now , we have only discussed the solutions of eigenequation @xmath59 without any external perturbation . in the thermodynamic limit where @xmath60 , the excited energies become a continuous energy band ; it is not hard to find that the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state ( see the fig .

    "<S> moreover , we study the robustness of this quantum communication protocol in the presence of disorder in the couplings between the nearest - neighbor quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the gap of the system plays an important role in robust quantum state transfer . </S>"
