    "polymer adsorption has been studied intensively in the last decades because of its wide practical applications and rich physics  @xcite .",
    "the early studies mostly focused on the adsorption onto physically and chemically homogeneous surfaces . in nature , however , real objects are very rarely perfectly homogeneous with ideal geometry .",
    "real substrates usually contain some heterogeneity .",
    "therefore , a number of more recent studies have considered the influence of random heterogeneities on the adsorption transition  @xcite .    from a more fundamental point of view , the adsorption of random heteropolymers ( rhps ) onto heterogeneous surfaces has attracted much attention , because rhps serve as biomimetic polymers to study the physics of proteins and nucleic acids .",
    "studying the interaction of rhps with random heterogeneous surfaces can provide insight into the physics of molecular recognition , a process playing a key role in living organisms ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , enzyme - substrate or antigen - antibody interactions ) .    the present work deals with the adsorption of homopolymers and heteropolymers on surfaces with chemical heterogeneities .",
    "as a general rule , the introduction of chemical heterogeneities at constant average load promotes adsorption , since the polymers can adjust their conformations such that they touch predominantly the most attractive surface sites .",
    "the adsorption transition is thus shifted to a lower value of the mean polymer / surface affinity .",
    "the extent of the shift is determined by the characteristics of the randomness . in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the influence of correlations on the adsorption transition .",
    "our study was motivated by the idea that clustering and the interplay of cluster sizes should contribute to molecular recognition .",
    "this idea is supported , among other , by a series of recent papers by chakraborty and coworkers  @xcite . using different analytical approaches and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations ,",
    "these authors have established that below the adsorption threshold , statistically blocky polymers favor statistically blocky surfaces over uncorrelated surfaces .",
    "they found that , upon increasing the strength of the interactions , the adsorption transition of heteropolymers on heterogeneous surfaces is followed by a second sharp transition , where the polymers freeze into conformations that match the surface pattern .",
    "this happens at adsorption energies significantly beyond the adsorption transition . in the biological context ,",
    "a two - step adsorption process where adsorption is followed by `` freezing '' possibly describes the physics of protein / dna recognition , where the protein slides on the dna for a while before finding it s specific docking site . for other molecular recognition processes , such as antibody - antigen interactions ,",
    "it is not only important that a protein adsorbs to a given particle , but equally crucial that it does _ not _ adsorb to other objects . in order to assess the importance of cluster size matching in those cases",
    ", one must calculate the shift of the adsorption transition as a function of correlation lengths on the polymer and on the surface .    in a previous publication  @xcite",
    ", we have calculated the adsorption / desorption transition of an ideal ( non - self - interacting ) rhp with sequence correlations on an impenetrable planar homogeneous surface .",
    "we have compared two different approaches .",
    "first , we have calculated numerically the partition function of a random sample of lattice rhps  @xcite . provided the sample is sufficiently large , this approach is basically exact .",
    "second , we have applied a reference system approach which was originally developed by chen  @xcite and denesyuk and erukhimovich  @xcite in a similar context ( rhp localization at liquid - liquid interfaces ) .",
    "the second approach allowed to derive an explicit and surprisingly simple expression for the adsorption transition point ( repeated here in eq .",
    "( [ trp_rhp_final ] ) ) , which fitted the numerical results excellently .",
    "having thus established the validity of the reference system approach , we use it here to study the adsorption of a single gaussian chain onto a heterogeneous planar surface with exponentially decaying site - site correlations .",
    "we consider both homopolymers and random heteropolymers . as in the case of the rhp on an homogeneous surface",
    ", we shall derive simple analytic formulae for the adsorption / desorption transition point .",
    "this will allow to discuss how surface patchyness influences the adsorption behavior , and whether the interplay of surface and polymer correlations can bring about something relevant to molecular recognition in the vicinity of the adsorption transition .",
    "the problem of adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces has already been considered theoretically by a number of authors , both for homopolymers and heteropolymers ( block - copolymers , periodic or random copolymers ) .",
    "baumgrtner and muthukumar  @xcite studied the effect of chemical and physical surface roughness on adsorbed homopolymers .",
    "using mc techniques , they calculated the adsorbed homopolymer amount on chemically heterogeneous surfaces , as a function of temperature and determined the shift of the adsorption - desorption transition temperature with decreasing concentration of adsorbing sites for different chain lengths .",
    "in addition , they presented a scaling analysis showing that lateral size of the adsorbed chain @xmath0 depends on the distribution of repelling `` impurities '' on the adsorbing surface and the strength of their repulsive interaction with the polymer .",
    "@xmath0 is unaffected by randomness and simply equal to the radius of gyration of a gaussian chain in two dimensions if impurities are very rare or weak . however , when the impurities are not rare and repulsive barriers are high",
    ", @xmath0 is of order of the mean distance between neighboring impurities .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by sebastian and sumithra  @xcite , who developed an analytical theory of the adsorption of gaussian chains on random surfaces , using path integral methods combined with the replica trick and a gaussian variational approach .",
    "they took surface heterogeneity into account by modifying de gennes adsorption boundary condition  @xcite , and analyzed the influence of randomness on the conformation of the adsorbed chains .",
    "mc simulations of single polymer adsorption have also been performed by moghaddam and wittington  @xcite .",
    "the sites on the heterogeneous surface were taken to be sticky or neutral for the polymer .",
    "the temperature dependencies of the energy and the heat capacity were calculated for different sticker fractions and compared for the cases of quenched and annealed surface disorder .",
    "huber and vilgis  @xcite have studied the case of physically rough surfaces .",
    "the above mentioned works dealt with the single - chain problem .",
    "a number of other authors investigated the adsorption from solution onto heterogeneous surfaces using mc simulations  @xcite , numerical lattice self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations  @xcite , and an analytical scf theory  @xcite .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the problem of heteropolymer adsorption on heterogeneous surfaces has been studied extensively by a.  chakraborty and coworkers .",
    "most of the results were summarized in a recent review article  .",
    "used replica mean field calculations and the replica symmetry breaking scheme to study the adsorption of gaussian rhp chains for _ theta _ solvents  @xcite and for good solvents  @xcite .",
    "mc simulations combined with simple non - replica calculations allowed to analyze the role of the statistics characterizing the sequence and surface site distribution , and that of intersegment interactions , for the pattern recognition between a disordered rhp and a disordered surface  @xcite .    the adsorption of globular rhps ( _ e .",
    "g. _ , rhps in a bad solvent ) on patterned surfaces has recently been considered by lee and vilgis with a variational approach  @xcite .",
    "a mc simulation study of single rhp chain adsorption onto random surfaces has also been performed by moghaddam  @xcite .",
    "interesting applications of interactions between copolymers and heterogeneous surfaces have been examined by genzer @xcite . using a three dimensional self - consistent field model",
    ", he studied the adsorption of a - b copolymers from a mixture of a - b copolymers and a homopolymers onto a heterogeneous planar substrate composed of two chemically distinct regularly or randomly distributed sites .",
    "he demonstrated that via substrate recognition , the copolymer can transcribe the two - dimensional surface motif into three dimensions . the specific way the surface motif is translated",
    "was shown to be strongly dictated by the copolymer sequence .",
    "the present work differs from all these approaches in that we focus on the adsorption transition , _",
    "i.  e. _ , on the region in parameter space where adsorption just sets in , and that we derive simple analytical expressions for the location of that transition .",
    "we shall see that the characteristic features observed in the regime of stronger adsorption do not necessarily carry over to this regime of weak adsorption .",

    "note that eq .",
    "( [ trp_all_final])is an implicit equation for @xmath139 , because the affinity @xmath153 depends both on the mean charge per segment @xmath136 of the polymer and the mean charge @xmath137 per site on the surface .",

    "thus the approximation is justified if the range of the potential is shorter than the statistical segment length . at first sight , this condition seems somewhat arbitrary , given that the value of the statistical segment length @xmath13 depends on the particular choice of the `` segment '' unit .",
    "one can always increase @xmath13 by choosing a more coarse grained polymer description , _",

    "the real length scale set by the non - adsorbed polymer is its radius of gyration . applying the approximation @xmath135 in the calculation of the adsorption transition",
    "is thus justified whenever the range of the potential is much shorter than the radius of gyration of the polymer .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows : the presence of correlations always enhances adsorption . both increasing the correlation lengths , _",
    "i.  e. _ , decreasing in @xmath25 or @xmath34 , and increasing the strength of the correlations ( given by @xmath26 , @xmath33 ) results in a shift of the adsorption transition towards lower affinities .",

    "this means that if the surface ( heteropolymer ) contains attractive , repelling , and neutral sites and is kept neutral on average , it is preferable to have strongly repelling and strongly adsorbing sites rather than weakly repelling and weakly adsorbing - `` almost neutral '' - sites .",
    "we note another interesting property of the considered model . in sec .",
    "[ deltaf ] , we have already discussed the equivalence of quenched and annealed _ surface _ disorder .",
    "the argument was based on the fact that all terms related to different replicas in eqs .",
    "( [ df_homo ] ) and ( [ df_hetero ] ) contain an extra factor @xmath101 , which vanishes in the limit of infinite surface area @xmath100 . technically , the factor @xmath101 reflects the loss of translational freedom of a replica , if it is restricted to stay close to another replica by a coupling through the correlation function @xmath159 .",
    "the argument is thus only valid for surface disorder .",
    "in general , quenched and annealed disorder on the _ polymer _ are not equivalent .    at the transition point , however , terms related to different replicas always vanish , because every independent replica also contributes a factor @xmath160 . in other words ,",
    "our model calculation predicts that the adsorption threshold is the same for quenched and annealed surface disorder .",
    "we believe that this is a general feature of the adsorption transition in disordered systems .",
    "joanny finds the same equivalence when studying the adsorption of polyampholytes on surfaces  @xcite within the hartree approximation .",
    "he claims that it has been conjectured for similar problems by nieuwenheuizen  @xcite .",
    "indeed , polymers and surfaces have only very few contacts at the adsorption transition .",
    "it is conceivable that the contacts can be arranged in an optimal way regardless of the particular type of disorder .",
    "if this is true , it has obvious implications for the phenomenon of molecular recognition : it means that studies of the adsorption transition in systems with quenched disorder , averaged with general , unspecific site distribution functions such as eqs .",
    "( [ seq_prob ] ) or ( [ surf_prob ] ) , can only provide very limited information about specific recognition processes .",
    "the adsorption threshold of an annealed polymer , which has had the opportunity to adapt its sequence to the surface , is absolutely equivalent to that of a completely unadapted ( quenched ) polymer .",
    "we can also use our results to discuss the issue of the interplay between cluster sizes on the surface and the homopolymer .",
