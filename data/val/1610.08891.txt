    "the experimental realization of ultracold atomic traps with the further control of the interaction between the atoms using the feshbach resonance technique @xcite provided an unprecedented playground to study few - body correlations @xcite that started long ago uniquely as a theoretical study in the nuclear context @xcite .",
    "more specifically , the tunability of the two - body interaction turned into a fact the prediction made by efimov that a system compounded by three identical bosons presents an infinity number of bound states when the energy of the two - boson subsystem tends to zero @xcite .",
    "this interesting phenomenon occurs exclusively in three dimensions @xcite as a consequence of the collapse of the three - body scale @xcite .",
    "the first proposal about how to use magnetic fields in order to confine cold neutral atoms was made by pritchard in 1983 @xcite and its experimental observation was made two years later by migdall @xcite .",
    "almost ten years after the first neutral atoms have been trapped , the question of dimensionality started to be explored in experiments @xcite .",
    "many aspects of the physics may change drastically when the system passes from three to two dimensions @xcite .",
    "two pertinent examples can be cited here .",
    "the first one is the possibility to have an inherent attraction for zero orbital angular momentum that automatically appears from the kinetic energy .",
    "the consequence is that any infinitesimal attraction binds the system ( in three dimensions the centrifugal barrier is always repulsive or null ) .",
    "the second example is related to the efimov effect cited in the previous paragraph . in two dimensions",
    "the thomas collapse is absent and no new scale should be added to the system at the universal regime : a two - body scale ( the two - body energy , @xmath0 , for example ) defines completely the three - body observables , e.g. for three identical bosons there are only the ground and first excited states with energies satisfying , respectively , the relations @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the universal regime is accessed when the size of the system ( a good quantity to describe it can be the two - body scattering length , @xmath3 ) is much greater than the range of the potential , @xmath4 . in this regime , the observables do not depend on the details of the short - range potential .",
    "the proportionality relations between @xmath0 and @xmath5 immediately shows that the infinite number of three - body bound states when @xmath6 is no longer possible in the bidimensional situation @xcite .",
    "however , we can imagine a favorable design to generate more than two three - body bound states .",
    "it was derived long ago that for an asymmetric system aab formed by two identical bosons with mass @xmath7 and a different atom with mass @xmath8 , it is possible to generate as many states as desired decreasing the ratio @xmath9 .",
    "the physical interpretation is that the effective potential becomes more attractive as the light atom can be easily exchanged by the heavy ones @xcite . the possibility to increase",
    "the attraction just by changing the mass ratio between the atoms creates an interesting situation : for any repulsion between the atoms of the heavy pair , we may always set a mass ratio in order to have a three - atom bound state .",
    "there is still another interesting result associated with the combination of both interactions : the sum of the effective and repulsive potentials creates a barrier separating two minima each of them supporting bound states with proper tuning .",
    "the related tunneling can be identified by the avoided crossing behaviour of the energy spectrum .",
    "the impressive development of the experimental techniques may then allow control over the localization of the wave function , and in turn provide a laboratory to simulate transfer of quantum information @xcite .",
    "the constant experimental advances of techniques involving ultracold atomic traps in the last ten years produced a remarkable ability to control the quantum properties of single atoms in an optical lattice @xcite .",
    "more recently , the study of dipoles became a hot topic in cold gases @xcite with a variety of experiments producing traps of mixed - atoms and dipole molecules @xcite .",
    "these long - range interactions may be controlled by changing the magnetic field or changing individually the magnetic moments of the atoms .",
    "the dipole interaction can be made attractive or repulsive depending on the orientation of the moments relative to their motion .",
    "the short - range interactions may be suppressed by using the feshbach resonance to tune a zero scattering length , and thereby producing a pure dipole - dipole interacting two - body system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we show briefly the formalism used to calculate in two dimensions ( 2d ) a three - body system in the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation formed by two identical heavy dipoles and one atom .",
    "we fix the directions of the dipoles in order to generate a repulsive or zero interaction between them .",
    "the atom - dipole interaction is assumed to be of very short range approximated by a zero - range interaction .",
    "we then derive the analytical form of the light - atom wave function in the configuration space which can be used as input to parametrize more realistic calculations . in section [ resultsa ]",
    "we discuss the solutions for vanishing dipole interaction as function of the mass ratio . in section [ results ]",
    "we investigate the solutions for finite dipole interaction .",
    "we specially focus on strengths around degeneracy of states localized in inner and outer minima , and finally we derive critical dipole - dipole strengths for stability of the three - body system . summary and conclusions are presented in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we show the formalism used to solve the three - body system formed by two heavy dipoles with masses @xmath7 and an atom with mass @xmath8 .",

    "we notice that the ratio of the numerically computed binding and the coulomb values are @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 for increasing excitation energy , respectively .",
    "the principal reason is that eq .",
    "( [ coulombexact ] ) only is the lowest order in an expansion for small @xmath38 , see @xcite .",
    "the next two terms contribute although varying only weakly with x , that is the first is simply a constant and the second correction term is logarithmic in @xmath38 . they both provide larger binding energy .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ critical ]    the failure is easily explained since the potentials are far from being weak as required for the landau criterion to be valid .",
    "the positive contribution from the huge barrier has no influence on the outer minimum where bound states can exist completely independent of the small distance behavior .",
    "this is related to the rather short range of the dipole potential .",
    "note that a short - distance potential like a gaussian would make it even worse .",
    "the critical strength for such potentials can only be related to the sizes of their tails at distances where the bound states are localized .",
    "thus , the properties of the outer minimum are decisive .",
    "we then investigate the total potential for large @xmath19 .",

    "( [ qeff ] ) and ( [ aff ] ) . when both eq .",
    "( [ asymppot ] ) and its derivative with respect to @xmath84 are zero at the same point in space , the total potential has a minimum value which precisely is above the infinitesimally small attraction sufficient to support a bound state .",
    "this potential is non - negative for all large values of @xmath84 .",
    "the solution to these two equations are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 inserting @xmath85 and the numerical values we then obtain @xmath88 which is precisely obtained by the explicite numerical calculation shown in table [ critical ] .",
    "the precision in this prediction is remarkable .",
    "the analytic result is obtained by assuming that even an infinitesimally small attraction at large distance would be able to support a bound state .",
    "it seems to be violating the landau criterion which is a global property for globally weak potentials .",
    "we interprete the above result by arguing that the possibly large positive potentials at small distance are irrelevant since that part can not provide any binding .",
    "we can then as well change the total potential to be zero in all space except at the large distances where a small attractive pocket is left for sufficiently large @xmath89 .",
    "certainly this new potential would be globally very weak since it is zero except at large distance where it is exponentially or cubically small .",
    "since the new potential also must have more bound states than the initial potential , we can use the original landau argument and determine when there is not even an infinitesimally small attraction left .",
    "we studied a three - body system composed of one light and two heavy particles , all confined to two spatial dimensions .",
    "we used a zero - range interaction between the light and each of the two identical heavy dipoles .",
    "this extremely short - range interaction has several advantages : first , it serves as a schematic prototype of a short - range interaction , second the properties can be semi - analytically derived , and third the results are universal by definition .",
    "the strength is parameterized in terms of the light - heavy system binding energy which then is one of our input parameters .",
    "we limit ourselves to a small light - heavy mass ratio allowing the use of the born - oppenheimer approximation for an effective potential between the two heavy particles .",
    "the two slowly moving heavy dipoles may also interact directly in addition to the born - oppenheimer potential .",
    "here we only considered the realistic possibility of the dipole - dipole interaction which has an inverse cubic dependence on their separation .",
    "the strength of this interaction is , beside the size of the dipole moment , determined by the direction of the dipole moments relative to the two - dimensional planar confinement . adjusting this orientation , which can be achieved experimentally through external fields ,",
    "the interaction can vary from an attractive to a repulsive potential passing through zero .",
    "we have in this report essentially only considered the repulsive and vanishing potentials .    after",
    "having established the formalism , we discussed the three - body properties emerging from the born - oppenheimer potential and vanishing direct heavy - heavy interaction .",
    "the light particle generates an effective interaction as a consequence of its exchange between the two heavy particles .",
    "therefore , the lighter the atom the easier it can be exchanged which then increases the heavy - heavy effective attraction .",
    "the number of excited states then increases with decreasing mass ratio , and it is in this way controlled by the constituents of the trap .    through the born - oppenheimer procedure we derived an analytic expression for the wave function depending on the three - body jacobi relative coordinates .",
    "we rewrite and exhibit the wave function in terms of two dimensionless coordinates and a dimensionless scale parameter . the logarithmic divergence is clearly seen when one of the heavy particles is on top of the light one .",
    "this coordinate - space wave function may be used in other `` realistic '' calculations as input to parameterize the large - distance universal tail of the wave function .",
    "the effective potential is coulomb - like at small distances with an effective charge proportional to the square root of two - body energy divided by the light particle mass .",
    "the corresponding coulomb degeneracy arising from angular momentum and radial node quantum numbers is very accurate for the lowest - lying well bound states .",
    "the systematic deviation from the coulomb results is traced to the next order attractive correction terms which are a sum of a constant and a slowly varying logarithmic term .",
    "the coulomb - like potential and the corresponding behavior are slowly destroyed as the energies approach the two - body continuum threshold .",
    "we included the dipole - dipole interaction , oriented to produce repulsion , and minimally regularized for zero separation .",
    "the total heavy - heavy potential is now the result of a competition between the two contributions . at the smallest distances , the coulomb - like attraction survives with a translated energy scale . for moderate repulsive strengths , a barrier appears before a broad minimum at larger distances .",
    "increasing the repulsion affects the short - distance localized states much more than states in the broad minimum .",
    "specific strengths therefore lead to crossing of inner and outer localized states . at",
    "avoided crossing points two levels are nearly degenerate and each a mixture of the two structures .",
    "characteristic signals of this type of tunneling phenomenon is the avoided crossing spectrum , and an exchange of properties like mean square radii between the two levels involved .    increasing the heavy - heavy repulsion",
    "sufficiently the bound states disappear one by one until no bound state is left and the three - body system is unstable towards emission of one of the heavy particles .",
    "this defines a critical dipole strength as function of mass ratio and two - body strength .",
    "we derived the landau criterion analytically for this critical strength , but concluded that it is wrong both quantitatively as well as qualitatively .",
    "the relatively short - range nature of the dipole repulsion requires a large strength to exclude all bound states .",
    "the resulting large positive barrier at intermediate distances violates the assumption of a weak potential for validity of the landau criterion .",
    "the last bound state owes its existence to a tiny attraction at the outer edge of the exponentially decaying born - oppenheimer potential .",
    "when this pocket is wiped out , the repulsive dipole has just passed the critical strength , which we analytically and numerically calculate to be proportional to the square of the inverse mass ratio .",
    "the study made in this paper can be tested experimentally and easily extended to three distinguishable particles .",
    "the possibility to localize degenerate wave functions in the two minima by tuning the interactions may provide an interesting alternative to controlled transfer of quantum information between these entangled states . the possibility to vary the strength by changing angles of the dipoles combined with the feshbach resonance technique to control the short - range interaction produces a very rich playground to study few - body correlations .",
