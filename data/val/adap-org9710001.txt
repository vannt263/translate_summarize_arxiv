    "life on earth originated 3.5 billion years ago . according to the earliest record of life , the first organisms were primitive one - celled non - photosynthesizing bacteria .",
    "two billion years then followed , before more complex multicelled organisms appeared in a catastrophic event called the cambrian explosion .",
    "this evolutionary event , which took place about 600 million years ago , led to a diversity of new species , and to a remarkable fossil record for the following phanerozoic period , which provides valuable and fundamental material for scientists who seek insight into the fascinating history of life on earth .",
    "unfortunately , the fossil record is often limited when it comes to understanding the development of a given species at the level of organisms , i.e. the micro - evolutionary processes .",
    "however , the record makes out a good statistical material at the macro - evolutionary level , where species and higher taxa are the basic units considered@xcite . at this and higher taxonomical levels , evolutionary measures , as for instance the distribution of life spans , provide a good characterization of biological evolution and a basis for understanding its underlying mechanism .    the evolution of species is typically sketched in the form of evolutionary trees with several lineage branchings . whenever a lineage branches , it marks the appearance of new species ( speciation ) , and whenever it stops , it marks the extinction of a species .",
    "we note that almost all species are extinct@xcite .",
    "the possibility of hybridization , where two lineages merge to form a new intermediate species , is normally not seen .",
    "other evolutionary changes are essential , the most prominent being the phyletic transformations taking place along a lineage . these transformations are basically darwinian changes in species due to natural selection .",
    "the extinctions associated with phyletic transformations are called pseudo - extinctions .",
    "several questions arise when this darwinian picture of evolution is taken under closer scrutiny .",
    "did species always have time to adapt to the changes in their environment ? and",
    "what are the selection mechanisms ( if any ) that on a species level determine who is to survive and who is to go extinct ?",
    "is evolution mostly characterized by gradual changes , or is it rather characterized by ` quantal jumps ' or ` punctuations ' , where new species are formed on a relatively short geological time scale ?",
    "we may further ask : can evolution be described by dynamical processes fluctuating around fix values , or is there a sense of direction in biological evolution , expressed , for example , by a steadily increasing fitness measure ? why should nature select an average life time for species to be four million years ?",
    "why not four thousand years or 4 billion years ?    explanations of evolutionary and extinction history can be coarsely classified",
    "according to their standing on the question of gradualism , to the importance they confer to ` bad luck ' as opposed to ` bad genes'@xcite , and finally according to their view on stationarity .",
    "all these issue have been intensely debated by paleontologist . from fossil data",
    ", it seems to us that nature has indeed not selected an equilibrium .",
    "for example , the standing diversity of families of marine vertebrates@xcite has increased by a large factor over the last 600 million years while , in the same period , the body plan complexity ( the number of different somatic cells in the most complex of the taxa extant at a given time ) has increased sixhundredfold@xcite . the extinction rate does not appear to have reached an equilibrium either . rather it seems to have a downward trend , as noted by raup and sepkoski@xcite in 1982 .",
    "their data are reproduced in fig .",
    "the decay of extinction intensity can be highlighted by integrating the extinction rate , measured as a percent of standing diversity .",
    "the accumulated extinction rate percent describes the number of extinctions in a ( hypothetical ) system with a constant standing diversity . if evolutionary dynamics were a stationary process , with  on average  an equal number of events taking place in any given time interval , this quantity would increase linearly in time . instead , as shown in fig .",
    "1b , it increases as a power law @xmath0 , and , correspondingly , the percentual rate of extinction @xmath1 decays as @xmath2 .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath3 is @xmath4 .",
    "admittedly , the extinction record shows large fluctuations .",
    "the events which fall outside the expected statistical variation@xcite are mainly related to the five big mass extinctions , which have attracted enormous interest , presumably due to their catastrophic impact on the ecosystem .",
    "the now most commonly accepted explanation of these events are meteor impacts@xcite .",
    "\\a ) the extinction rate ( extinction per million years ) for families of marine vertebrates and invertebrates is plotted as a function of geological time .",
    "these data are redrawn from ref.@xcite .",
    "b ) using the information on the corresponding standing diversity available from the same source , the extinction rate is converted in an extinction percentage , which is then integrated and shown in a log - log plot as a function of time .",
    "if extinction were a stationary process , this cumulative extinction percentage should fall on a line with slope @xmath5 . instead , as highlighted in the plot , the majority of data points fall on a line with slope @xmath6 . in plots",
    "a ) and b ) the origin of time is set to @xmath7 million years ago , corresponding to the beginning of the phanerozoic period .",
    "c ) the shown data describe the distribution of extinction event sizes , expressed as fraction of the extant species killed .",
    "the data are redrawn from ref .",
    "as shown in the figure the distibution of event sizes falls off approximately as a power law .",
    "the exponent is @xmath8 , which , as we argue in the text , is the reciprocal of the exponent characterizing the decay of the rate of extinction .",
    "meteor craters have been looked for and identified to account not only for the mass extinctions but also for several minor events , where a diversity of species seems to suddenly disappear within a short geological time span .",
    "however , since mass extinctions only represent a small fraction of the data , they only exert a relatively minor influence on the extinction rate .",
    "an intriguing result of the decay of the extinction rate is its direct influence on other evolutionary measures .",
    "consider for instance the frequency @xmath9 of extinction events in which a fraction @xmath10 of the extant species are killed .",
    "the empirical form of this quantity is reproduced in fig.1c after raup s data @xcite .",
    "if @xmath11 is defined as the joint probability density that an extinction of size @xmath12 happens at time @xmath13 , we then have @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "let us now for simplicity neglect fluctuations altogether , i.e. assume that extinctions of a given size only take place at a given time , with the biggest extinction coming first .",
    "if a stage has length @xmath16 , the fraction @xmath17 of the system which is removed at time @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , one can easily show that our deterministic assumption , together with the form of the marginal distributions , implies @xmath19 .",
    "we then find by integrating over @xmath13 that @xmath20 .",
    "in other words this ( undoubtedly oversimplified ) argument predicts that the size distribution should decay as a power - law , with an exponent which is the reciprocal of the one characterizing the decay of the rate of extinction .",
    "a glance to fig.1c shows that - in spite of the approximation involved , the prediction is in reasonable agreement with the data , as far as the decaying part of the curve is concerned .",
    "the fact that we are ` missing ' some of the small extinction events is  in this interpretation  attributed to a ` finite time ' effect , in that the very small events are yet to come .",
    "an additional source of discrepancy pulling in the same direction is that small events might be simply lost in the noise .",
    "this interpretation differs from the stationary view of evolution implied in the kill curve@xcite , where events of any size can happen with a time independent probability distribution . by way of contrast , in a non - stationary scenario , the mean waiting time for an event of a given size , together with other statistical parameters , strongly depends on the age of the system .",
    "a last very important available evolutionary measure is the distribution of the life - time of species , which is shown in fig .",
    "these data were tabulated by raup@xcite based on the compilation of sepkoski@xcite .",
    "they describe the empirical life - time distribution of about @xmath21 extinct genera of marine animals .",
    "they cover about @xmath22 million years and display a very clean @xmath23 dependence .",
    "the distribution lacks an average , a wideness which matches the variation in the life times of now existing species .",
    "available evolutionary data present a challenge for the theoretician , a challenge which has been recently taken up in several different approaches @xcite .",
    "starting from extremely simplified assumptions , these models make use of ideas and techniques borrowed form physics , particularly the statistical mechanics of interacting systems , in order to find quantitative predictions for evolutionary measures .",
    "it seems unlikely that any single model should capture all the complexity of biological evolution .",
    "an additional reason to keep an open mind on the issue of modeling is that even the interpretation of rather basic data is still open to discussion .",
    "it has for instance been suggested@xcite that extinction events should be periodic , with a period of approximately @xmath24 million years .",
    "the cause of periodicity is usually assumed to be external forcing . by way of contrast ,",
    "other descriptions - including the present one - view extinction data as the realization of a stochastic process , where peaks and valleys do not need a detailed explanation .",
    "instead , one is interested in understanding the distribution which generates the events .    because evolution on a large scale is hardly a reproducible experiment",
    ", one might pessimistically believe that modeling beyond data fitting is a pointless exercise .",
    "our point of view is that  on the contrary  exploring in detail the mathematical consequences of various assumptions will eventually contribute to a clarification .",
    "models strongly differ on the issue of the relationship between evolution and extinction .",
    "in some cases @xcite it is assumed that the evolution of one species affects the likelihood that a ` neighbor ' species would evolve .",
    "evolutionary landscapes of different species become then linked to one another through ecological interactions .",
    "modifications of the abiotic environment exemplified by meteor impacts or any other source of stress are included as an additional mechanism in ref .",
    "@xcite , while in ref .",
    "@xcite they are considered the exclusive causes of extinctions in a system of non - interacting species .",
    "the approximate scale invariance in several evolutionary measures ( see fig",
    ".  1 ) has prompted the hypothesis that evolutionary systems should be in a ` self organized critical state ' .",
    "the bak and sneppen model which explores this idea is extremely simple : a set of agents is placed on a line .",
    "each agent - or species - is characterized by one random number , a barrier which has to be overcome . at any given time the agent with the lowest barrier evolves ,",
    "i.e. it receives a new _ random _ number .",
    "the evolution of one agent triggers the movement of its neighbors , which are then removed from the lattice ( evolve or die ) and replaced by new agents with a random fitness . with this dynamical prescription ,",
    "the system organizes itself into a state of dynamical equilibrium , where the overwhelming majority of the agents has fitness above a well defined critical threshold .",
    "an ` event ' or avalanche starts when a fluctuations pushes at least one agent below the thresholds and subsides when the system returns to normality .",
    "the size distribution of the avalanches is a power - law with an exponent close to @xmath25 .",
    "this is relatively far from the behavior of the data , which are better described by an exponent close to @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "the distribution of the life - times of the agents is likewise a power - law , with an exponent @xmath25 , also relatively far from the correct value of @xmath26 .",
    "newman and roberts@xcite have generalized the bak - sneppen model by including the effect of environmental forces , which are modeled by a randomly distributed fluctuating stress .",
    "agents with fitness lower than the current stress value die and are replaced by new agents , whose fitness is randomly assigned .",
    "this model has the advantage over the bak - sneppen model of more clearly distinguishing between evolution and extinctions .",
    "it likewise offers a scale invariant event size distribution , with an exponent close to @xmath26 ( and closer to the data ) . in a later paper@xcite newman considers a different model , where the direct co - evolutionary element is removed , while the effect of the external environment remains the one just described .",
    "this is in other words a pure ` bad luck ' model , with non interacting agents subject to a common source of external stresses , also referred to as ` coherent noise ' .",
    "the distribution of the event sizes is only very weakly dependent on the type of noise , and is in most cases well characterized by a power - law with an exponent @xmath26 over a wide range of scales .",
    "the distribution of life - times is a power - law with an exponent close to @xmath27 . a related paper by sneppen and newman@xcite analyzes this model from a more technical point of view .",
    "the authors find that for a wide variety of noise distributions the event sizes are distributed as @xmath28 , with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , slightly depending on the noise distribution .",
    "the life - time distribution is found to have the power - law form @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , it does not seem possible in this approach to have exponents for the size distribution and the life - time distribution which both are in the correct range .",
    "the model of sol and manrubia@xcite and an analytically tractable further development by manrubia and paczuski@xcite strongly emphasize ecological interactions among species , and do not include the possibility of evolution of species in isolation .",
    "the interactions are defined by a connection matrix @xmath32 , which has positive as well as negative entries .",
    "the sum of the elements of @xmath32 in column @xmath33 defines a ` viability ' @xmath34 of species",
    "the species goes extinct when its viability goes below zero .",
    "it is then replaced by a speciation process , in which the new agent filling the niche strongly resembles one of the extant species .",
    "( which differs from all the other cases described , where replacements typically occur at random ) .",
    "the dynamics is driven by random changes in the connection matrix and leads to a power - law distribution of extinction events with an exponent close to @xmath26 . in the simplified analytical version",
    "the decrease in viability is put into the model rather than following from the change of the connectivity matrix .",
    "this model predicts the correct form of the life time distribution and of the extinction event size .",
    "being stationary , it also has a constant average rate of extinction . on the other hand it produces an endogenous oscillatory behavior ( waves of extinctions ) which could offer an explanation of the possible periodicity of extinctions .",
    "most authors  implicitely or explicitly  assume that evolution is a fluctuation driven process . in this paper",
    "we take the opposite view , expanding a non - stationary model of macroevolution which has previously been described in two brief communications@xcite .",
    "we provide more detail on the model itself and a more complete discussion of its relationship to the empirical data and to other approaches .    the fact that a slow non - trivial transient dynamics is present in biological evolution seems to us a clear feature of the data which calls for further studies of the fossil record from a temporal perspective .",
    "we also note that a slow transient dynamics seems a general inherent property of strongly interacting systems with many degrees of freedom and a complex state space .    in the next sections",
    ", we shall pursue the idea of a transient evolution dynamics .",
    "mathematical results that these models fortunately allow for will be derived and compared to available data .",
    "we mainly discuss two evolutionary measures which are natural in our approach : the life - time distribution and the rate of extinction . from the latter ,",
    "the distribution of extinction event sizes , @xmath9 can be approximately derived as sketched in the introduction .",
    "one might describe a living organism abstractly in terms of its genome - a string of data coding for a certain functionality . from this point of view , each individual is a point in an extremely large space or ` fitness landscape ' @xcite , where genetically similar individuals appear as clusters .",
    "species and higher taxa can be viewed as clusters at different levels of resolution . on appropriate time scales , the typical genotype , which coarsely describes the genetic pool ( cluster ) of a species , moves from one metastable configuration to another , due to the influence of mutations@xcite .",
    "there are at least two conceptually distinct ways of producing punctuated behavior . one way is based on an ` energy ' picture , where the fitness landscape is assumed to have strong barriers , which the population has to cross to get to another fitness peak@xcite .",
    "this picture introduces long times of stasis , where the typical genotype of a species does not change .",
    "another possibility is to emphasize entropic barriers . in this case , the long time scales are due not to fitness barriers , but rather to the simple fact that another fitness peak may be hard to find , given the enormous number of possible mutations .",
    "more specifically , one can expect a diffusion like behavior in genome space along directions which are selectively neutral @xcite , while , under stable or metastable conditions , mutations in other directions must be mainly rejected .",
    "neutral mutations are instrumental in maintaining population diversity and in creating paths between distant local fitness maxima . in a simple golf metaphor",
    ", the energy picture corresponds to getting the ball over a hill ; you have to push the ball against gravity to get it over to the other side .",
    "the entropy picture , on the other hand , corresponds to getting the ball into the hole , which may be difficult , even on a flat green .",
    "we now consider an extremely simplified picture of evolutionary dynamics : a single species ( with a population sufficiently large to avoid extinctions by size fluctuations and other random factors ) evolving under constant external physical conditions .",
    "the model will be used as a stepping stone and a basic ingredient for the more complicated case involving co - evolutionary mechanisms .",
    "the main idea is to map evolutionary dynamics into a search for fitness records , which then correspond to evolutionary events .",
    "this mechanism does not strongly depend on whether entropic or energetic mechanism dominate the population dynamics .",
    "it leads to punctuated equilibrium , because , as new records are harder and harder to find , the system tends to stay put in the same state for longer and longer times .",
    "the idea of an optimization driven dynamics which becomes progressively slower has appeared before .",
    "in addition to the remark of raup and sepkowski already cited , we note that kaufmann@xcite has explored the idea in the context of ` long jump ' dynamics on nk landscapes , also speculating on its applicability to technological and biological evolution .",
    "the exploration of genome space performed by a population of individuals is akin to a random walk , with a generation being the unit of time , and with mutations corresponding to steps taken in different random directions . if fitness values change smoothly - or not at all - from one site of the landscape to a neighboring site , there will be connected subsets of genome space within which fitness values are highly correlated .",
    "we assume that these correlated volumes can be visited within a certain characteristic time scale , choose this scale as the unit of time and coarse grain each correlated volume into one point .",
    "the coarse graining leaves us with a rugged fitness landscape , where each move leads to a new fitness value unrelated to the previous one .",
    "species sit on a local fitness maximum in this landscape : more accurately , the individuals of the species occupy a correlated volume around a fitness peak .    in order to derive a dynamical rule for coarse level evolution ,",
    "let us return to individual mutations . with a certain probability , the rare mutations which give their bearers a selective advantage over all other individuals will establish themselves throughout the population . although this process may spontaneously regress , we assume for simplicity that it happens with probability one and within one ( or few ) of our coarse grained time step(s ) .",
    "our ` optimistic ' model makes each species the keeper of the ` best ' genome found ` so far ' in the evolutionary search within a neighborhood of the landscape .",
    "as the rugged fitness landscape is very high dimensional , we can neglect the unlikely event of a random walker retracing its steps .",
    "in this case , the fitness values successively generated in a sequence of mutations leading from one region to the other in the landscape effectively constitute a stream of independent random numbers .",
    "furthermore , according to our above assumption , the system evolves if and only if a fitness record is encountered , in which case the gene pool moves from a local fitness maximum to the new higher maximum .",
    "we call this form of evolutionary dynamics for record driven dynamics .    the evolution dynamics for one species in a fixed environment and the statistics of records in a series of random numbers independently drawn from an identical distribution are  in our model  mathematically equivalent .",
    "as it will become clear , the statistics of records is largely independent of the choice of distribution generating the fitness values .",
    "the size of the jump also being unimportant , we have a model with _ no _ fitting parameters , aside from the time unit .",
    "the highly idealized one - species system in a constant physical environment is clearly far removed from natural conditions .",
    "it has however been studied in the laboratory with microbial cultures of _ e. coli _ by lenski et al.@xcite , whose experiments provide us with empirical data to which our predictions can be compared .",
    "a great advantage of the simple record model is that it allows for an exact mathematical description @xcite .",
    "consider a sequence of independent random numbers drawn from the same distribution at times @xmath35 .",
    "we exclude distributions supported on a finite set , because they eventually produce a record which can not be beaten .",
    "the first number drawn is by definition a record .",
    "subsequent trials lead to a record if their outcome is larger than the previous record .",
    "we seek the probability @xmath36 of finding precisely @xmath37 records in @xmath13 successive trials , where @xmath38 . in the derivation",
    "we need the auxiliary function @xmath39 , which is the joint probability that @xmath40 records happen at times @xmath41 , with @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is simply the probability that the first outcome be largest among @xmath13 .",
    "as each outcome has , by symmetry , the same probability of being the largest , it follows that @xmath44 . in order to obtain two records at times @xmath5 and @xmath45 , the largest of the first @xmath46 random numbers",
    "must be drawn at the very first trial .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath47 .",
    "secondly , the @xmath45th outcome must be the largest among @xmath13 .",
    "this happens with probability @xmath48 , independently of the position of the largest outcome in the first @xmath46 trials .",
    "accordingly , @xmath49 summing the above over all possible values of @xmath45 we obtain @xmath50 in the more general case of @xmath37 events , we similarly obtain @xmath51 we now take @xmath52 and sum over all possible values of the @xmath53 s .",
    "this leads to @xmath54 an approximate closed form expression can be obtained by replacing the sums by integrals , which is reasonable for @xmath55 .",
    "the integrals can then be evaluated finally yielding @xmath56 interestingly , eq .",
    "[ log - poisson ] is a poisson distribution , but with @xmath57 in place of the more usual @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath58 and @xmath59 be the average and variance of the number of events in time @xmath13 . as an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "[ log - poisson ] we note that @xmath60 if one assumes that each evolutionary event carries a fixed amount of ` improvement ' , in a sense made precise later , measured averaged fitness and fitness variance will have the same type of time dependence .",
    "we also note that the ` current ' , i.e. the average number of events per unit of time decays as @xmath61    another consequence of eq .",
    "[ log - poisson ] is the following : let @xmath62 be the times at which the record breaking events occur , and let @xmath63 be the corresponding natural logarithms .",
    "the stochastic variables @xmath64 are independent and identically distributed .",
    "their common distribution is an exponential with unit average . by writing : @xmath65 we have that @xmath66 approaches a standard gaussian distribution for large @xmath40 .",
    "hence , the waiting time @xmath67 for the @xmath40th event is approximately log - normal , and the average of its logarithm grows linearly in @xmath40 . by jensen",
    "s inequality @xcite we also find @xmath68 we see that the average waiting time from the @xmath40 th to the @xmath69 st event grows at least exponentially in @xmath40 .",
    "consider finally the case in which a system is made up of @xmath70 several parts which act independently of each other . this could for example happen in a very large population which splits into subpopulations occupying geographically separated areas .",
    "the total number of record events within a certain period of time is the sum of the events affecting each subpopulation .",
    "this sum remains poisson distributed , with average @xmath71 rather than @xmath72 and our conclusions remain therefore unchanged up to a trivial scale factor .",
    "we first note that the record dynamics gives rise to an event rate which , according to eq .",
    "[ oneovert ] , decays as a power law . in the most simple scheme , where a fraction of the evolutionary events leads to extinctions",
    ", this would indeed imply a power - law decay of the extinction rate .",
    "however , the exponent would be @xmath73 , and not @xmath74 as suggested by the fossil data",
    ". it would also be surprising if the exponents coincided , since no ecological or co - evolutionary interactions among species have yet been considered . in the next chapter",
    "we shall see how such interactions may change the extinction rate .",
    "the logarithmic growth of fitness in a population evolving under constant external conditions has been observed in experiments by lenski and travisano@xcite .",
    "these authors considered 12 populations of _ e. coli _ , which were all generated by identical ( cloned ) ancestors , and were allowed to grow in identical but physically separated environments .",
    "they investigated the change in mean cell volume and fitness , the latter defined as the malthusian rate of population increase .",
    "the data depicted in fig .",
    "2 are taken from ref .",
    "they show the time dependence of the average fitness in a single population of _",
    ", relative to its original ancestor .",
    "we have redrawn these data on a semilogarithmic scale , to demonstrate the agreement with the logarithmic growth predicted by our record driven dynamics .",
    "lenski and travisano also studied the variance of the mean fitness and cell volume across different populations , and found them to be growing .",
    "our model predicts a logarithmic growth for the fitness variance as well as for any other quantities which changes - on average - by a constant amount upon an evolutionary improvement .    the mean fitness in one population of _",
    "e. coli _ grown in a glucose - limited environment , is shown in a semilogarithmic plot as a function of the number of generations .",
    "the original data and a detailed description of the controlled evolution experiment can be found in ref .",
    "note that the data approximately follow the logarithmic fitness growth curve discussed in connection with the reset model .",
    "the ` reset ' model includes the idea that macroevolutionary events are triggered by fitness records , and complements it with the possibility of extinctions through interspecies interactions in an ecological space .",
    "the model deals with a number of highly idealized species evolving and interacting with one other within an ` ecology ' .",
    "the whole system is conveniently depicted as a graph , in which nodes correspond to niches and edges represent interactions among the ( neighbor ) species which occupy them .",
    "model species are born , evolve and eventually die . in most of the treatment below the (",
    "physical ) external conditions are assumed constant .",
    "however , we additionally consider a ` meteor ' variant of the model where the effects of changes in external conditions are modeled as random killings ( i.e. unrelated to fitness ) of a fraction of the systems species .    the evolution part of the reset model is",
    "basically the record dynamics just described . between evolutionary changes ,",
    "no extinctions are allowed and the system remains quiescent .",
    "when a species evolves , it is assumed to modify the fitness landscape of its ecological neighbors , thus creating the possibility of extinctions .",
    "consider a species evolving from fitness @xmath75 to @xmath76 . by definition of the model update rule ,",
    "those among its neighbors having fitness less than @xmath77 are declared extinct and removed from the system . in the next time step ,",
    "the empty niche is ` reset ' , i.e. it becomes occupied by a freshly initialized species .",
    "this defines the reset model .",
    "note that the reset rule depends on the rank ordering of the agents , not on the specific form of the fitness .",
    "we have implemented versions of the model with slight differences in the details of the removal and replacement of the species .",
    "however , we find the results to be robust to these changes .    in the simulations discussed below , the ecology is modeled as a regular lattice .",
    "previously , we have investigated both one and two dimensional systems @xcite , obtaining very similar results , so we here confine ourselves to a 2d grid with unit lattice constant . in this grid ,",
    "the neighborhood of the point @xmath78 is defined as the set of integers : @xmath79 such that @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "the only tunable model parameter is the coupling range , @xmath82 : if @xmath83 our system reduces to a set of uncoupled agents , each searching for records in its own fitness landscape , while if @xmath84 all agents are coupled to each other .",
    "the reset dynamics could be simulated time step by time step , every time assigning for each agent a random trial fitness value , drawn from a given distribution .",
    "however , in this implementation nothing happens until the trial fitness value of a given agent exceeds the current value , a process which is computationally inefficient . instead",
    ", we shall make use of some analytical results described below , allowing us to skip the inactive periods .",
    "our simple choice is to draw all fitness values from a uniform distribution in the unit interval . as the first value drawn is by definition the first record @xmath85 ,",
    "this quantity is also uniformly distributed in the unit interval .",
    "the @xmath69th record is required to exceed its predecessor and is therefore uniformly distributed in @xmath86 .",
    "the conditional probability density @xmath87 that @xmath88 after @xmath40 records is given by : @xmath89 the formula is trivially true for @xmath90 . for @xmath91",
    "it suffices to note that eq .",
    "[ dist1 ] solves the recursion relation @xmath92 , where the factor @xmath93 provides the proper normalization of a uniform density in the interval @xmath94 .",
    "for later convenience we use the related fitness measure .",
    "the probability density @xmath95 , that @xmath96 after @xmath40 records is found by a change of variables in eq .",
    "[ dist1 ] yielding @xmath97 the form of @xmath95 indicates that @xmath98 arises as the sum of @xmath99 independent and identically distributed variables @xmath100 , each describing the fitness increment in one evolutionary step .",
    "their common distribution is an exponential of unit average : @xmath101 it immediately follows from eq .",

    "note the strong rebound effect after the mass extinctions , which is superimposed on the decaying background rate .    in order to describe the effect of external ` catastrophes ' we simulated a modified version of the reset model , where  on top of the usual reset dynamics  a randomly chosen set of agents",

    "this replacement differs from the usual extinction rule in that it is indifferent to evolution , i.e. species with high and low fitness are killed with equal probability . furthermore all the affected species are removed in a single time step , as in a mass extinction .",
    "we again show life - time distributions for four different coupling lengths ranging from @xmath164 in plate a ) to @xmath154 in plate d ) .",
    "even though these plots are almost indistinguishable from those of the previous two figures , the dynamics has been changed considerably by introducing five ` external ' random catastrophes , where @xmath172 and @xmath173 % of the extanct species are chosen at random and removed .",

    "the severity of the events measured as a percent of the total extant species which were killed was @xmath172 , and @xmath173 .",
    "the massive events have a clear effect on the rate of extinction : randomizing the system makes the pace of evolution higher . bursts of evolutionary activity after each big event are shown in fig .  7 , which depicts the rate of extinction in the relevant time window for a system with @xmath154 . the time is expressed in hundreds of millions of generation since the start of the simulation .",

    ". these curves are almost indistinguishable from their counterparts without catastrophes .",
    "the reason is simple : in the model , as well as in reality , the overwhelming majority of extinctions happens outside the big events .",
    "some analytical insight in the behavior of the reset model can be gained by studying a mean field version , of course at the price of introducing further simplifications .",
    "the extended model has one tunable parameter , the coupling length , which gauges the strength of interspecies interactions .",
    "if this parameter is large enough , i.e. four or above , its precise value has little influence on the behavior of the reset model .",
    "it seems therefore natural to investigate the extreme limit in which all species are coupled together . in this limit , it is possible to formulate a mean field theory as a partial differential equation for the distribution of fitness values , @xmath182 .",
    "the material in this section mainly follows a brief account previously published in @xcite .",
    "in addition we consider a model variant with a different form of the killing term .",
    "this variant has predictions in disagreement with the empirical data , but it is nevertheless included to illustrate , within this modeling context , the negative effect of choosing a symmetric type of interaction .      the partial differential equations defining the time evolution of @xmath183 are designed to mimic the behavior of the reset model , where  as we have shown  a suitably defiend average fitness grows logarithmically in time .",
    "the additional fact that the distribution does not spread appreciably@xcite during the course of evolution suggests that one should consider a _",
    "first order _ transport partial differential equations ( pde ) .    in the simpler limiting case where no extinctions take place",
    ", we just have hill climbing in a random fitness landscape . as remarked right after eq .",
    "[ incr ] , the average fitness then increases logarithmically in time , whence the average velocity fulfills @xmath184 .",
    "this is generally true if each improvement is on average of the same size , a size which we for convenience assume equal to one .    with no interactions , each agent moves in fitness deterministically and independently of the others .",
    "the initial fitness distribution is therefore simply shifted in ( log ) time , as expressed by the following partial differential equation : @xmath185 we introduce interactions via a term @xmath186 , where @xmath187 is an effective killing rate reflecting the balance of extinction and speciation at a given @xmath102 , while the proportionality constant @xmath188 determines what fraction of the system is affected by an evolutionary event .",
    "assuming that evolution is the cause of extinction , we require that @xmath187 vanishes if the evolutionary current is zero .",
    "species going extinct vacate a niche , which can be refilled at a later time . in order to formally account for this flow in and out of the system",
    ", it is convenient to introduce a ` limbo ' state , which absorbs extinct species , and from which new species emerge at the low fitness boundary of the system . requiring a finite upper bound to the total number of species which the physical environment can sustain amounts to a conservation law : @xmath189 . in this notation @xmath190",

    "from the point of view of biological data assuming that the extinction rate varies slowly over some typical time scale of species life time , seems very reasonable : the rate of extinction appears to change appreciably on a scale of a hundred million years , while the range of species life - times is better expressed in millions of years .",
    "returning to the analysis of the model , we first note a major difference in the asymptotic behavior for @xmath220 and @xmath299 . in both cases the time independent function @xmath300 obtained by taking @xmath301 and by setting @xmath302 in eq .",

    "in this paper we have described a model of evolutionary dynamics which builds on two basic elements : 1 ) the dynamics of a single species in a constant physical environment is assumed to follow a record statistics , leading to a logarithmic improvement of different evolutionary measures , and 2 ) extinctions are caused by co - evolution : the evolution of a species removes its less fit neighbors .",
    "this approach is analyzed numerically as well as analytically in a simpler , mean field version .",
    "our first model assumption stems from considering the behavior of random walks in highly dimensional rugged fitness landscapes .",
    "it stresses the fact that a species maintains a record of its past history through a stable genetic pool and states that the statistical properties of this pool can only change when a random mutation appears , which is better than the ` best so far ' .",
    "its predictions are in good agreement with the intersting empirical data obtained by lenski and travisano @xcite on the evolution of bacterial cultures in a nutrient deprived environment .",
    "our second assumption leads to good agreement with empirical data regarding the life time distribution of species and the decay of the extinction rate .",
    "the size distribution of events , which is the main focus of many other ( stationary ) approaches , is in our case derived from the the rate of extinction , as discussed already in the introduction .",
    "also in this respect our model is in good agreement with the data .",
    "the behavior of the system as a whole is characterized by the fact that , as time goes , the dynamics approaches that of a single agent optimizing its fitness . in this sense",
    "one could talk about increasing correlations among the species .",
    "when the system is partly randomized by external catastrophes modeling sudden changes of the environment , the whole system is set back in its evolution as shown by the strong rebound effect in the rate of extinction .",
    "interestingly , catastrophes do not change the life - time distribution in any significant way . in summary ,",
    "our model offers a single , albeit approximate , explanation of most evolutionary data , linking the distribution of life spans with the behavior of the rate of extinction and of the distribution of event sizes .    from the vantage point of a theoretical physicist ,",
    "the scale invariance present in evolution and extinction data begs for an explanation . as mentioned in our introductory discussion",
    "several different theoretical approaches currently exist . on the opposite extreme of the modeling spectrum , purely _",
    "statistical _ considerations have lead to the suggestion that extinctions are basically due to external periodic forcing , stemming impacts from from celestial bodies@xcite . as biological evolution",
    "is a non - reproducible experiment ( within the time scales available to human observers ) , the dilemma of what really has happened might not be easily solved .",
    "biological history contains a good measure of frozen accidents which do not have and probably do not require specific explanations .",
    "therefore , it seems hard ( and pointless ) to exclude that different mechanisms for evolution and extinction ( i.e. rocks from the sky _ and _ species competition ) could have play together to shape the course of evolution .",
    "we would expect progress in clarifying the relative importance of various modeling elements to come from closer scrutiny of the basic assumptions , particularly at the level of population dynamics .",

    "our data analysis ( i.e. the values of the exponents ) depends very weakly on making this assumption .",
