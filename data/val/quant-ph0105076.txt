    "differently from single - wells , for multiple - wells the number @xmath14 of minima of @xmath5 depends on @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xcite . on the frontier separating regions in the @xmath17-plane with different values of @xmath14",
    " a _ caustic _  @xmath18 diverges due to the vanishing of the fluctuation determinant around the minimum that appears or disappears there . in the present context , this divergence is an artifact of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "thus , a simple manner of eliminating it is certainly called for ; this is the purpose of this paper .",
    "as the caustic problem appears in other contexts in physics , it is instructive to briefly review how it comes about , and how it has been dealt with , for the sake of comparison . in optics ,",
    "caustics occur whenever light rays coalesce .",
    "thus , they separate regions of different number of extrema ( the light rays ) of the optical distance ( the analogue of the action ) . in order to go beyond geometrical optics",
    ", one has to take into account fluctuations around these light rays .",
    "just as in the present case , singularities emerge when we compute quadratic fluctuations on caustics .",
    "ways to avoid this have been known for some time @xcite .",
    "indeed , due to the traditional analogy between wave optics and quantum mechanics , the techniques involved are similar to the ones used in deriving connection formulae for wkb approximations @xcite , and consist essentially in replacing one or more of the fresnel integrals that arise in the stationary phase approximation with a so - called diffraction integral , whose form is specified by the classification of the caustic according to catastrophe theory @xcite ; in the simplest case it is an airy - type integral .",
    "a general procedure has also been developed to deal with caustics in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "although this general procedure could , in principle , be adapted to the case at hand , the nature of our problem allows for simplifications which warrant special treatment .    in _ nonequilibrium",
    "_ quantum statistical mechanics , caustics are also known to occur in semiclassical descriptions of the decay of metastable states .",
    "the problem here is that of a particle in a potential which has a local minimum separated by a barrier from a region where it is unbounded below , in contact with a thermal reservoir .",
    "the phenomenon of caustics has been associated with a transition from the classical to the quantum regime of the decay rate @xcite .",
    "general prescriptions for dealing with this phenomenon near the top of the barrier have been given in great detail @xcite .",
    "the case we shall analyze in this article differs from the one in the previous paragraph in the following aspects : ( i ) we discuss a problem in _ equilibrium _ quantum statistical mechanics ; ( ii ) our analysis is global , in the sense that we compute the density matrix diagonal for every point on the real axis .",
    "it also differs from analyses carried out in optics and quantum mechanics because of the euclidean nature of the path integral : only minima are to be considered ; saddle - points are discarded .",
    "( this is strictly true only in the `` usual '' semiclassical approximation .",
    "our `` improved '' approximation makes use of some of the saddle - points . ) in fact , in the specific example we analyze ( the quartic double - well potential ) only one new ( local ) minimum is introduced in function space after the various catastrophes that occur as we change the temperature ; as it appears after the first catastrophe , this is the only one we have to consider .",
    "( again , this is valid only for the `` usual '' semiclassical approximation ; the improved one also requires an analysis of the second catastrophe . )",
    "this results in a prescription for dealing with caustics that is simple and direct .",
    "previous works have studied the quartic double - well potential at finite temperature using semiclassical methods @xcite .",
    "our work complements and extends those studies , by giving an explicit recipe for dealing with caustics .",
    "variational methods have also proven extremely useful in this problem , and were quite successful in addressing applications in condensed matter physics @xcite .",

    "this article is organized as follows : before introducing the improved semiclassical approximation , which will remedy the problem of spurious divergences , sec .  [",
    "improved ] briefly reviews the derivation of the usual semiclassical approximation to the density matrix .",
    "the new method is , then , presented in two alternative ways : one has a better physical motivation , and clearly illustrates the essential ideas , but lacks effectiveness as a calculational tool ; the other provides a general recipe to perform the calculations in a systematic way , resorting to the use of complex trajectories .",

    "what changes as the second catastrophe is crossed is the identity of the `` lower saddle - point '' : for @xmath210 , it is to be found among the solutions of eq .",
    "( [ q0qt ] ) ; for @xmath207 , it is given by any one of the two periodic trajectories satisfying @xmath208 ( since they have the same action ) .",
    "as a matter of fact , since all periodic trajectories with the same amplitude ( and the same period ) have the same action , we may pick the one that satisfies the condition @xmath204 , for then we can use eq .",
    "( [ i[qc ] ] ) to compute its action .      in the high - temperature limit , @xmath213",
    ", thermal wavelengths are very small , and the classical limit sets in , as quantum fluctuations are suppressed . that is the regime where our improved semiclassical approximation should work best , as illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , since it incorporates quantum fluctuations in a controlled manner as we lower the temperature , and profits from the simplification of having to deal with only one or two minima , as already emphasized .",
    "nevertheless , even in the opposite limit , @xmath212 , our improved semiclassical method can be used to reproduce zero temperature results .",
    "the secret is to recognize that the various saddle - points which were discarded for finite @xmath182 _ do _ play a role in such a limit ; in fact , taking them into account is equivalent to using a dilute - gas approximation , as we will qualitatively argue .",
    "first , however , let us review how the saddle - points emerge .    for a fixed @xmath138 in the interval @xmath214 , new saddle - points will appear as we increase @xmath182 , following a pattern outlined in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as a result , the strip of the @xmath161-plane defined by @xmath215 and @xmath216 may be divided into regions wherein each @xmath161 point gives rise to @xmath217 solutions , @xmath218 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ caustic.ps ] .",
    "the regions are separated by caustics where instabilities develop : for @xmath127 even , as we cross the caustic between the regions with @xmath217 and @xmath219 solutions , a @xmath127-saddle , i.e. , a solution with @xmath127 negative eigenvalues , and a @xmath220-saddle appear ; for odd values of @xmath127 , the @xmath127-saddle in the region with @xmath217 solutions becomes unstable  it is replaced , in the region with @xmath219 solutions , by two @xmath127-saddles which are periodic , and by a @xmath220-saddle .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath221 , we end up with a @xmath222-saddle , @xmath223 pairs of @xmath127-saddles with @xmath224 , and a pair of minima ( two @xmath225-saddles ) .    as @xmath212",
    ", the two minima will correspond to solutions @xmath226 that spend most of their euclidean time @xmath227 near either @xmath228 or @xmath229 .",
    "they both have a single turning point , and only the local minimum will cross the origin @xmath230 : first , at a small value of @xmath227 ; and upon returning , at a large value @xmath231 . the @xmath232-saddles , which are periodic , have two turning points , will also cross the origin twice , but one of the crossings will occur at a value of @xmath227 near @xmath233 . generalizing this qualitative analysis , we may conclude that @xmath127-saddles will have @xmath220 turning points and @xmath127 inner ( away from @xmath234 and @xmath235 ) crossings of the origin .",
    "each of those inner crossings is equivalent to a kink or an antikink , so that a generic @xmath127-saddle will not differ much from a solution built out of a superposition of kinks and antikinks in that limit .",
    "typically , the euclidean time width of such kinks should be much smaller than their separations , as the solutions tend to spend most of their time near @xmath236 .",
    "varying the euclidean times where those inner crossings occur should not alter significantly the action of the @xmath127-saddle in the @xmath212 limit , an indication of the existence of a flat direction in functional space corresponding to that variation . as flat directions are associated to near - zero eigenvalues",
    ", we claim that the negative eigenvalues which characterize the @xmath127-saddle will approach zero from below as @xmath212 , and that the euclidean times where the crossings occur should be treated as collective coordinates @xcite , just as the positions of kinks and antikinks in the dilute - gas approximation .",
    "the contributions of the various kinks and antikinks can be dealt with in the usual manner  they add up to an exponential , and reproduce the standard result for the splitting between ground and first - excited state @xcite .",
    "( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite for a treatment of the low - temperature limit within the functional formalism that does not appeal to the dilute - gas approximation . )",
    "semiclassical methods are a powerful nonperturbative tool , for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems .",
    "this article , together with refs .",
    "@xcite , represents a further step towards a systematic semiclassical treatment of quantum statistical mechanics .    in the present work",
    ", we developed a simple procedure to derive the lowest order semiclassical approximation for the case of multiple - well potentials in equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics . in order to adequately incorporate new extrema , we kept fluctuations beyond the quadratic level along the `` unstable '' direction in functional space , and relied on our knowledge of the type of catastrophe involved as we cross a caustic to eliminate spurious singularities in the semiclassical approximation , obtaining sensible results for the density matrix elements for any temperature .",
    "this was exemplified by the analysis of the quartic double - well potential .",
    "our results can possibly be extended to nonequilibrium systems , such as those where a time - dependent potential is coupled to a heat bath , in order to better understand transient regimes . although the physics of nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics has been considered in detail in the context of semiclassical calculations of the decay rates of metastable systems @xcite , a thorough analysis of the various transient regimes , and of the interplay of their corresponding time scales , is still needed . here",
    ", however , we will no longer profit from the drastic reduction in the number of extrema that occurs in equilibrium situations , as time evolution forces us to deal with saddle points and maxima , as well .",
    "the simplified methods presented in this paper will still be useful to describe the asymptotic imaginary time evolution corresponding to equilibrium , but not the real time evolution , which requires the traditional quantum mechanical treament .",
    "as for possible extensions to field theories , the methods developed in @xcite should be applicable to the evaluation of the effective potential in the presence of non - trivial backgrounds ( defects ) , as long as they depend on only one coordinate .",
    "this can be of use in a wealth of possible applications , and should help in the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena where such defects play a role .",
    "cases such as the ones explored here and in @xcite , which involve several extrema , still lack a field theoretic treatment .",
