    "a common thread in unconventional superconductivity is that it emerges close to a quantum critical point ( qcp ) .",
    "a qcp is the point in a phase diagram where long - range order is suppressed to zero temperature , @xmath6 , by an external parameter other than @xmath7 so that quantum , rather than thermal fluctuations drive the transition@xcite .",
    "one way to rationalize the qcp in heavy fermion metals is the phase diagram proposed by doniach@xcite in which the ground state evolves from a local moment antiferromagnet to a heavy fermion paramagnet as a function of the tuning parameter @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the exchange coupling strength and @xmath10 the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "the qcp then corresponds to the point where the kondo energy scale @xmath11 equals the rkky scale @xmath12 .",
    "the quantum - critical spin - fluctuations associated with the suppression of antiferromagnetic order are likely involved in the pairing mechanism for unconventional superconductivity @xcite .",
    "this picture has been considered as an explanation for a broad range of superconductors , including high-@xmath13 cuprates@xcite , heavy fermion metals@xcite , cobaltates@xcite , as well as the recently discovered iron - pnictides@xcite . however , there are also important exceptions where unconventional superconductivity is observed and",
    "no competing magnetic order is found , such as in the cases of ube@xmath14@xcite and sr@xmath15ruo@xmath16@xcite .",
    "there is also the possibility of valence , rather than spin , fluctuation mediated superconductivity as suggested for cecu@xmath15si@xmath15 under pressure@xcite . +",
    "many studies have used doping as a tuning parameter between superconducting and antiferromagnetic ground states in a broad range of strongly correlated electron systems hosting a qcp@xcite .",
    "the heavy fermion metals in particular are very susceptible to chemical substitution . in these compounds the kondo coupling between a lattice of local moments and",
    "the conduction band creates quasi - particle excitations with large effective masses , and the dopants disrupt the coherent kondo coupling .",
    "such studies have been essential in assessing the percolative nature in which the coherence in the kondo lattice emerges -see for example the la - dilution study of cecoin@xmath0@xcite- as well as its sensitivity to disorder@xcite .",
    "but doping can also tune the ground state by changing the carrier concentration as is remarkably illustrated in the high - t@xmath17 cuprates@xcite .",
    "one important aspect of doping the cuo@xmath15 layers in the high - t@xmath17 cuprates is the apparent electron - hole symmetry : the phase diagrams are qualitatively similar whether the carriers introduced are electron - like or hole - like .",
    "one can then focus on a universal phase diagram as a function of the carrier concentration , without having to investigate the local effects associated with each particular dopant .",
    "this symmetry is not found in cecoin@xmath0 and so it is not possible to define a universal phase diagram with doping as we demonstrate below .",
    "+ cecoin@xmath0 is a heavy fermion superconductor@xcite where cooper pairs are formed out of a non - fermi liquid metallic state .",
    "the divergence observed in the electronic specific heat , as well as the non - quadratic @xmath7-dependence of the resistivity found even at very low temperatures , suggest the presence of a qcp when superconductivity is suppressed by a magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the nature of the qcp has been the subject of much speculation , but it seems likely to be an antiferromagnetic qcp .",
    "hall effect measurements under pressure have shown that the qcp is located not exactly at the upper critical field @xmath18 but at a slightly lower field@xcite .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering@xcite and nmr measurements@xcite , on the other hand , have revealed the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations within the superconducting state .",
    "more recently , a field induced antiferromagnetic order coupled to superconductivity has been discovered close to @xmath18 via neutron scattering@xcite and @xmath19sr measurements@xcite in pure cecoin@xmath0 .    the ability to grow sizable ,",
    "high quality , single crystals enables detailed investigation of the effect of chemical doping in this and other 115 compounds .",
    "while sn - doping was found to suppress @xmath13 without revealing any incipient magnetism@xcite , cd doping induces an antiferromagnetic ground state in cecoin@xmath0 . the same behavior is also observed in the two other stoichiometric ce@xmath20in@xmath0 ( @xmath21rh , ir)@xcite as well as the bilayer ce@xmath22in@xmath23(@xmath21co , rh , ir)@xcite with cd doping . because sn and cd are neighbors to in in the periodic table , sn and cd substitutions for in result in electron and hole doping , respectively .",
    "the effect of cd is quite unusual in the sense that it takes a very small density of cd to induce the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic ( afm ) ground state transformation which can be reversed with the application of pressure@xcite .",
    "how cd induces long range afm order with a large ordered magnetic moment@xcite ( 0.7@xmath24 per ce ) in cecoin@xmath0 remains an open question .",
    "one possible mechanism is the formation of antiferromagnetic droplets at the cd sites , as was inferred from nmr measurements@xcite .",
    "long range afm order occurs once the density of such droplets reaches the percolation threshold .",
    "however , the density of cd necessary to induce ordering is well below the percolation threshold .",
    "thus the ordering at such a small cd concentration requires very long correlation length and correspondingly large size of the ordered droplet around each dopant .",
    "thus the ordering at such a small cd concentration requires interactions with a longer range .",
    "since the ordered moments are likely local moments on the ce sites , one way to account for the reversibility of cd doping with pressure is to speculate that the change in carrier density and disorder caused by cd substitution localizes the @xmath25-electrons of nearby ce atoms .",
    "application of pressure to metals with localized f - orbitals tends to increase the hybridization with the conduction band and delocalize f - electrons .",
    "alternatively , the afm state is due to a fermi surface ( fs ) instability , which is the well - known explanation in the case of elemental cr .",
    "recent neutron scattering results in cd doped cecoin@xmath0@xcite have demonstrated that the afm ordering has a wavevector , @xmath26 of ( 1/2,1/2,1/2 ) suggesting that if the afm is nesting - driven , the nesting wavevector is commensurate with the lattice .",
    "this is a plausible , but unusual , situation that occurs , for example , in mn doped cr@xcite .",
    "it is possible that in the situation intermediate between local and itinerant the magnetic ordering is driven by the local , unscreened component of the spin , and the improved near - nesting with cd doping lowers the energy cost of opening the gap for itinerant electrons at the magnetic brillouin zone boundary , enabling the long - range order to appear .",
    "perhaps the most surprising feature of this ordered state is that the ordering wavevector@xcite coincides with the wavevector at which an inelastic neutron scattering resonance@xcite is observed in the superconducting state of pure cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "the origin of this resonance has been attributed to afm magnons@xcite and we suspect the coincidence is not accidental .",
    "a similar afm state can be induced with rh substitution for co in cecoin@xmath0 for rh concentrations greater than @xmath27 @xcite . here , the afm wavevector is identical to that found for cd doped cecoin@xmath0 , which coexists with superconductivity for rh concentrations of less than @xmath28 . for larger rh concentrations",
    "the afm wavevector becomes ( 1/2,1/2,@xmath29 ) and superconductivity is suppressed .",
    "the change in wavevector and the loss of superconductivity at rh concentrations above @xmath30 suggest that the afm state in rh ( for @xmath31 ) and cd doped cecoin@xmath0 has a different character from the local moment antiferromagnetism found in cerhin@xmath0 . in order to understand more fully the superconducting state in cecoin@xmath0 and the relevance of the nearby afm qcp",
    ", the character of the afm state will require further investigations .    in this paper",
    ", we report on one such investigation by specifically exploring the evolution of the fs of both cecoin@xmath0 and lacoin@xmath0 as a function of cd doping via de haas van alphen ( dhva ) oscillations .",
    "we observe that the changes to the fs with cd substitution are consistent with the addition of holes and that the fs varies with cd substitution at a similar rate in both compounds .",
    "our results thus rule out @xmath25-electron localization as a possible route towards afm order . if this were the case it would lead to a significantly different evolution of the fermi surfaces of ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 and the non - magnetic la - analog .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first present the experimental details in section ii followed by an introduction to the phase diagram in section iii .",
    "section iv focuses on the evolution of the fermi surface in cd doped cecoin@xmath0 in comparison to cd doped lacoin@xmath0 while section v presents the effect of cd on the cyclotron effective mass and mean free path .",
    "we summarize our findings in section vi and discuss the possible mechanism(s ) for afm order in cd doped cecoin@xmath0 that is ( are ) consistent with our data .",
    "the single crystals of ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 and laco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 used in our experiments are grown from in flux in a ratio of ln : co : in : cd ( @xmath32 ) from high purity starting materials , as described elsewhere@xcite .",

    "this is as expected since cd atoms are smaller than in atoms .",
    "the volume contraction rate is similar in both the ce and the la compounds and is in quantitative agreement with the contraction inferred from a local structure , extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) , investigations@xcite for the same nominal concentrations .",
    "exafs results also indicate that cd , as well as sn , preferentially substituted for in on the in - plane , in(1 ) , site@xcite .",
    "the close agreement between the powder and the single crystal x - ray lattice parameters ( see fig .  [",

    "however , the enhancement of @xmath61 with sn doping is not simply a chemical pressure effect since sn has no detectable effect on the lattice volume@xcite .",
    "nor is the suppression of @xmath61 specific to cd : a recent investigation on rare - earth substitution has shown that @xmath61 is systematically suppressed as the ce lattice is diluted , regardless of the magnetic or electronic nature of the rare - earth dopants @xcite .",
    "this fact , taken alone , may seem to suggest that the small suppression of @xmath61 with cd doping is effectively a dilution effect as cd localizes the f - electrons on a small number of neighboring ce ions . as we see below , this is not supported by our measurements .",
    "moreover , there is an important difference in that both yb@xcite and cd@xcite act as hole dopants but only cd stabilizes the afm state in cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "the opposing effects of sn and cd instead suggest that the changes to @xmath61 are a consequence of the shift in the chemical potential corresponding to electron or hole doping .    tuning the ground state with cd does not appear to conform to the doniach phase diagram of competing rkky and kondo scales@xcite since no systematic change is observed in either the curie - weiss temperature ( see fig .

    "nmr measurements@xcite also indicate an absence of change to the low energy spin fluctuation spectrum with cd substitution in cecoin@xmath0 in the paramagnetic state .",
    "thus , the natural question is whether the cd - induced antiferromagnetism is , instead , due to a fermi surface instability , a possibility we investigate via the dhva measurements presented below .",
    "to investigate the changes to the fermi surface with cd substitution that coincide with the variations noted above , we have systematically measured the dhva oscillations as a function of @xmath62 , @xmath7 , and the magnitude and direction of @xmath63 .",

    "a maximum in the transverse mr of an @xmath68 sample is observed at around the same field ( not shown ) .",

    "in fact , the rate at which the @xmath76 frequency ( electron orbit ) is suppressed with cd is very similar , within the limits of our measurements , in the ce and the la analogs as emphasized by the linear fits in fig .",

    "one would then expect the @xmath76 branch to decrease at a faster rate in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 when compared to its la - analog .",
    "this suggests that the fs of the @xmath77 sample is significantly larger than that of the antiferromagnetic counterpart cerhin@xmath0 and rules out the localization of @xmath5electrons at the onset of antiferromagnetism at @xmath2 .",
    "the nucleation of a local moment afm state at @xmath78 with a large ordered moment , @xmath79 per ce , would require a substantial density of localized ce @xmath25-electrons .",

    "the similar evolution of the fermi surface in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 and its la analogs suggests that the effect of cd is primarily a rigid band shift ( or equivalently a shift in the chemical potential ) due to the additional hole in _ both _ systems , without significant change in the ce valence or the kondo hybridization of the @xmath70 electron .",
    "this is perhaps the most important finding of our investigation ; the @xmath5electrons in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 remain itinerant with cd doping .",

    "[ fig : phasediagram ] and the insensitivity of the dhva frequencies to cd doping .",

    "[ fig : freqvscdall]c and d we observe a systematic variation with @xmath62 in some of the dhva frequencies : the frequency of the electron orbits @xmath82 decrease , while that of the hole orbit , @xmath83 , increases with increasing @xmath62 .",
    "this suggests that the electron fermi surface ( @xmath84 ) shrinks for increasing cd concentration , while the hole fermi surface ( @xmath83 ) expands .",
    "note that the @xmath85 orbit , which derives from the same hole",
    "fs , is relatively constant suggesting the expansion of the hole sheet is not uniform .",
    "overall , the fs evolution in laco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 can be simply understood as a chemical potential shift : cd effectively is a hole dopant since cd has one electron less than in .",

    "this smearing may be stronger for hole than for electron orbits as a consequence of their larger effective masses@xcite .",
    "the electron fermi surface in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 also shrinks ( @xmath76 decreases with @xmath62 ) , and we can safely interpret this as the effect of hole doping in analogy with laco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 . note that the reduction of the volume of the electron fs sheet corresponding to the decrease of @xmath76 is very modest and accounts for only @xmath87 of the hole introduced by cd ( see appendix ) .",

    "gap@xcite are known to be anisotropic , we can not exclude that the chemical shift due to cd leads to a more dramatic volume change on the hole sheet of the fs , and that this change creates nesting conditions .",
    "note that the suppression of the @xmath88 and @xmath89 electron orbits with cd in both the ce and la compounds may indicate a more cylindrical ( less corrugated along the @xmath90-axis ) electron sheet .",
    "perhaps such small changes in corrugation also lead to improved nesting along the c - axis . since the wave vector remains commensurate in the plane ( 1/2 , 1/2 ) , and it is only the c - axis component that becomes commensurate in cd doped cecoin@xmath0 , as compared to pure cerhin@xmath0@xcite , small changes in the fermi surface may indeed cause this lock onto commensurability .",
    "figure  [ fig : meff ] shows the dhva amplitudes as a function of temperature for the @xmath76 and @xmath88 orbits in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 . as the temperature is increased , the landau levels are broadened , and the dhva oscillations suppressed .",
    "this suppression is well described by the lifshitz - kosevich ( lk ) formula@xcite:@xmath91 with @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the dhva amplitude , @xmath94 the @xmath6 amplitude , @xmath95 the effective mass , @xmath96 the bare electron mass , and @xmath97 t / k .",
    "the fit to the lk expression ( see solid lines in figure  [ fig : meff ] ) allows the determination of the effective cyclotron mass @xmath95 for each orbit .",

    "similar to our results , no mass enhancement is observed via dhva measurements in rh doped cecoin@xmath0@xcite , in which no change in the fermi surface is observed at the onset of afm order .",
    "the absence of mass enhancement with cd doping may be simply due to the high magnetic fields used for detecting dhva oscillations and known to be detrimental to @xmath95 .",

    "the lack of mass enhancement near the qcp is similar to the case of cr where the qcp is not accompanied by a large carrier mass enhancement .",
    "this has been shown to be due to the small phase space occupied by the exchange enhanced magnetic fluctuations@xcite .",
    "in contrast , dhva measurements on cerhin@xmath0 under pressure reveal a drastic change to the fermi surface , with diverging effective masses , at the pressure required to suppress the antiferromagnetic state@xcite . in light of these results",
    ", the absence of mass enhancement in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 at @xmath105% may be related to the absence of significant changes to the light mass fermi surface sheets and indicate the possibility of strong fluctuation scattering only on specific sections of the fermi surface .",
    "these are known as hot spots and we may not be observing these specific fs regions in our investigation . such hot spots , where the cyclotron effective mass diverges , have been previously reported in cubic cein@xmath106@xcite .",
    "the large ordered moment in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 of @xmath107 per ce@xcite for @xmath80 suggests that the purported sdw transition opens a gap over a large fraction of the fs and , further , that the precursor fluctuations in the paramagnetic state may make it difficult to observe the parts of the fs involved even at high field .",
    "this may explain the absence of dhva oscillations for much of the fs ( both hole and electron fs ) for @xmath108% as large fractions of the fs may be involved in the nesting associated with the sdw - like state .",

    "the values obtained by us are consistent with the previously reported@xcite @xmath130  nm and 70  nm in lacoin@xmath0 and cecoin@xmath0 respectively .",
    "we found that in both compounds there is a systematic suppression of the mean free path due to disorder scattering introduced by the cd substitution .",
    "a similar suppression is observed in the residual resistivity ratios ( rrr)with increasing cd concentrations for laco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 ( see table  [ table : dhva1 ] ) , with the rrr defined as the ratio of the zero field resistivity at 300 and 3 k ( not shown ) .",
    "the rrr values in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 do not directly reflect the degree of disorder in the material due to the presence of the coherence peak and therefore they have been omitted in table  [ table : dhva1 ] .",
    "the most obvious effects of cd substitution into cecoin@xmath0 and lacoin@xmath0 that our data reveal are the systematic lattice contraction , as we established with x - ray diffraction , and the chemical potential shift due to the hole doping as apparent from the analysis of our dhva data in laco(in , cd)@xmath0 .",
    "we demonstrated that for laco(in , cd)@xmath0 the dhva frequencies associated with the main electron fermi surface sheet decrease , while those of the hole sheet increase in a manner consistent with hole doping with cd substitution .",
    "in addition , we demonstrated that a dhva frequency associated with the electron sheet of cd doped cecoin@xmath0 , which is the only piece of the fermi surface resolved in our dhva data , decreases at a rate similar to the la analog , again consistent with that expected for a small density of doped holes .",
    "the corresponding change in the electron fs volume only accounts for 1/30 of the doped hole / cd , suggesting that the added holes are mainly distributed over the remaining pieces of the fermi surface , which we do not observe .",
    "overall , the fermi surface of ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 remains closely related that of pure cecoin@xmath0 , with only modest changes in the dhva frequencies and cyclotron masses , despite the dramatic evolution of the zero field ground state from superconducting to superconducting+antiferromagnetic .",
    "the similarity of the changes that occur with doping in the la and ce compounds allows us to rule out any substantial @xmath5electron localization and , thus , to rule out mechanisms for the antiferromagnetic state that rely on local moment formation .",
    "it follows that the commensurate afm order in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 is likely due to an itinerant , sdw - type , mechanism which relies on fs nesting .",
    "the most famous example of sdw ordering that is commensurate with the underlying lattice is the elemental antiferromagnet cr which , although incommensurate when pure , evolves to a commensurate state with small mn doping@xcite .    our dhva data are also similar to that of rh doped cecoin@xmath0@xcite where the fs is seen to undergo small changes so that a large fermi surface is observed in both cd and rh doped cecoin@xmath0 .",
    "thus , for both cd and rh substitution into cecoin@xmath0 commensurate afm order coexisting with superconductivity is observed along with a fermi surface that appears to contain a substantial contribution from the ce 4@xmath25-electrons .",
    "the main difference in these two substitution series is that cd substitution suppresses superconductivity@xcite for concentrations beyond 15% , while superconductivity remains apparent up to 60% rh substitution@xcite",
    ". the stronger suppression of superconductivity with cd may be the consequence of in - plane impurity scattering .",
    "however , there are several aspects of cd doped cecoin@xmath0 that remain poorly understood .",
    "it is well known that pressure applied to ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 causes a return to paramagnetism and an increase of the superconducting critical temperature so that pressure appears to reverse the most obvious consequences of cd doping@xcite . if the main effect of cd doping into cecoin@xmath0 is a shift of the chemical potential caused by the addition of holes as our data suggest , then it is difficult to account for the reversible tuning of the afm order with pressure . for any reasonable value for the compressibility of cd",
    "doped cecoin@xmath0 the carrier density change with experimentally accessible pressures would be very small .",
    "thus , it is unlikely that pressure simply reverses the changes that occur with cd doping .",
    "this suggests that there are subtle changes that occur to cecoin@xmath0 with doping or pressure that are more likely associated with the kondo effect and the formation of the heavy fermion metallic state . a second ,",
    "perhaps related important open question , and perhaps a clue to the origin of the afm order , is why the magnetic structure is commensurate , with the same wavevector , @xmath131 , as the neutron scattering resonance observed in superconducting , nominally pure , cecoin@xmath0@xcite .",
    "in addition , the lack of more direct evidence for sdw formation leaves open the possibility that the magnetic state in ceco(in@xmath3cd@xmath4)@xmath0 has a character intermediate between local moment or highly itinerant so that a simple description is difficult .",
    "it appears from our data , as well as from the nmr results@xcite , that cd doping of cecoin@xmath0 into an afm phase does not conform to the doniach model@xcite where the kondo and rkky coupling compete at a quantum critical point .",
    "instead our data suggest that a more itinerant antiferromagnetism develops out of a fermi surface which contains the hybridized ce 4@xmath25-electrons .",
    "the role of cd for inducing this afm order in cecoin@xmath0 remains elusive and the resolution of this mystery is likely to broaden our approach to quantum criticality beyond the doniach phase diagram .",
