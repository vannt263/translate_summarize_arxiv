    "during the past 15 years , effective field theories have been proven to be valuable tools in different branches of physics . in hadron physics ,",
    "the need for effective field theories is brought about by the intractability of @xmath0 at low energies around @xmath5 .",
    "of course , the distinction between @xmath0 on the one hand and effective field theories on the other is somewhat artificial at the conceptual level since @xmath0 itself is probably an effective field theory of something more fundamental .",
    "however , for practical purposes , it is clear that the examples of effective field theories we are considering , namely chiral lagrangians formulated in terms of pseudoscalar fields , are much more restricted in their domain of validity and richness of phenomena they can describe than @xmath0 .",
    "the most prominent , i. e. energetically lowest lying , degrees of freedom of such hadron effective field theories are pions ( and kaons ) thought to be the goldstone modes of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of @xmath0 .",
    "what makes these mesonic effective field theories tractable in a concise fashion is the concept of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6 ) , pioneered by weinberg @xcite-@xcite and for the first time exploited by gasser and leutwyler @xcite @xcite , which has been successfully applied to a variety of meson- and meson - baryon phenomena ( for the latter case , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath6 allows to calculate processes in a way that starting from a meson lagrangian @xmath7 systematically includes all relevant terms up to some power of external momenta , which correspond to the number of derivatives ( chiral order ) contained in the vertices generated from @xmath7 , and the quark masses .",
    "the only theoretical input are universally accepted principles like chiral symmetry ( and a certain pattern of symmetry breaking ) , lorentz covariance etc . .",
    "the essential attraction of @xmath6 stems from the fact that calculations are no longer model dependent in the traditional sense . unless some of the underlying general principles could be proven wrong , and as long as higher degrees of freedom ( e.g. vector mesons ) can safely assumed to be frozen , one only has to decide on the power in external momenta to which the calculation will be carried , and in this way the error introduced is under control .",
    "the price to pay for this conceptual stringency rests with the fact that even at small orders , there is a vast number of independent terms in the effective lagrangian , each comes along with its own low energy constant ( @xmath8 ) to be fixed from experimental information . since experimental knowledge , as well as the practical ability to include terms in a calculation",
    "are both limited , so is the applicability of @xmath6 .",
    "baryons have been introduced into the overall framework of effective field theories in several different ways : one possibility , directly related to @xmath6 , is to treat them as external fields coupled in the most general chiral invariant manner to pions .",
    "a similar momentum ( and quark mass ) power counting like the one outlined above may then be employed to calculate the dressing of the originally pointlike particle by meson loops , provided the baryon is treated as a heavy field ( @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in this form , the proliferation of terms allowed from chiral symmetry alone already at the lowest nontrivial chiral orders is even more worrisome than in the purely mesonic case , and consequently the applicability of @xmath10 is restricted even further compared to meson @xmath6 .",
    "is lost .",
    "therefore , the idea to create the baryons as solitons from the meson fields themselves without explicit fermionic degrees of freedom has been considered an especially attractive alternative , which has the advantage that one might directly build upon the effective lagrangian established in @xmath6 in the mesonic sector .",
    "it is this aspect that defines the scope of our paper , namely , to investigate the extent to which the concept of baryons as solitons in effective meson theories can be linked to the methods and results of purely mesonic @xmath6 .",
    "evidently , the consideration of loop corrections will be the crucial link in this connection .    in order to provide the reader with some motivation of",
    "what follows in the course of our report , we shall in this introduction recall the state of affairs in topological soliton models , outline the problems one has to face in trying to go beyond this status quo , and shed some light on the relationship between ( baryon ) @xmath6 and the soliton model calculation we are going to consider .",
    "the skyrme model @xcite , invented about 35 years ago , yet reconsidered only within the timeframe mentioned in the beginning , emerges from the realization that nonlinear effective meson theories allow for topologically nontrivial static solutions ( solitons ) whose conserved topological index is then tentatively interpreted as the baryon number .",
    "spin and isospin of the soliton are supplied by quantizing the zero modes of the problem .",
    "the reasons which left this model dormant for about 20 years after its inception ( except for it being somehow orthogonal to the mainstream developments in medium energy physics ) were essentially twofold : firstly , in the absence of a suitable expansion parameter there was no compelling reason why zero modes should be preferred over other fluctuations in the soliton s quantization .",
    "secondly , there was no argument to constrain the soliton to have half integer spin .",
    "the solution to both these problems is of course well known : the difficulty with half integer spin could be removed upon consideration of the wess - zumino - witten anomaly , whereas the work of thooft @xcite , @xcite and witten @xcite on the expansion of @xmath0 in powers of the inverse number of colours @xmath1 , besides making the concept of solitonic baryons more palatable as a low energy approximation to @xmath0 , showed that the pion - baryon coupling is suppressed in @xmath1 ( pions being identified with non - zero mode fluctuations of the soliton ) , and in this guise saved the zero mode quantization as a first approximation for baryon properties .",
    "since we will be concerned with corrections to this approximation , it is at this point worthwhile to recall some results given in reference @xcite .",
    "there , it was shown that the @xmath0 coupling constant scales like @xmath11 if one assumes a smooth large @xmath2 limit for the @xmath4-loop gluon self energy graph which would give rise to the worst divergences in @xmath2 .",
    "essentially from that result it follows that the pion baryon coupling must be of @xmath12 , whereas the baryon mass is of @xmath13 .",
    "provided one accepts the conclusions of @xcite , one can calculate many observables to leading @xmath13 , and since the picture of meson physics predicting baryon physics seemed rather appealing , the cited references consequently triggered a plethora of papers on the skyrme model and its generalizations , examples of which are @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the leading contributions in @xmath1 to static baryon properties , formfactors and pion nucleon scattering were calculated .",
    "what marred these calculations and what made the model character of the skyrme model was the difficulty to establish a firmly posed lagrangian from which to start , since the @xmath1 expansion gives no argument as to the general form of @xmath7 .",
    "this meant that terms in @xmath7 were mostly chosen for computational convenience and carried adjustable parameters .",
    "the resulting possibility to tailor the lagrangian in order to obtain a best value for some quantity under consideration makes a clear judgement of the merits and defects of the skyrmion approach to baryon physics difficult , because most calculations were limited to one or a few baryon observables for which the model used could be fine tuned . since we want to provide the reader with a motivation for our project , we shall now investigate in some detail the status of several quantities within the skyrme model .    in the following , we present a list of quantities which have been calculated in @xmath14 skyrme - type models .",
    "although even this fairly long list is not exhaustive , it may serve as a yardstick against which the quality of the model can reliably be measured , and which clearly illustrates the problems mentioned above . therefore ,",
    "in table [ introres ] we present entries obtained from the standard skyrme model with one free parameter @xmath15 , in one case adjusted to give the best possible overall picture of baryon properties and in a second case chosen in order to cure already at leading @xmath13 what was perceived to be a major shortcoming , namely the too large soliton mass .",
    "it should be evident , that in the latter case , optimization of one value can only be achieved at the expense of all others .",
    "eventually , we have included in table [ introres ] ranges of the results for the different quantities as can be found in the skyrmion literature .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     here , one observes that all quantities except two are rather well reproduced already at this level .",
    "the two exceptions are the isoscalar magnetic moment and the neutron - proton - split of the electric polarizability .",
    "the latter is less severe in view of the huge error of the experimental value , but @xmath16 is seriously defective and it seems unlikely that a next order quantum correction would be able to remedy this discrepancy . in principle , however , there is the possibility of a quantum correction of the same order as the tree level in @xmath1 since the time derivative contained in the spatial component of the winding number current expanded to quadratic order in the fluctuations may act on a fluctuation instead of a collective coordinate and twin fluctuations count as @xmath1 like the angular velocity .",
    "we are not yet in a position to decide whether this is the root cause for the too small isoscalar magnetic moment .    finally , we shall briefly recapitulate the course of this report : in the beginning we posed the question whether it is possible to renormalize a chiral lagrangian evaluated in a nontrivial topological sector in analogy to the methods known as chiral perturbatuion theory for the vacuum sector .",
    "the main problem is the restriction to a finite number of gradients contained in the lagrangian , which is not a priori justifiable in the presence of a soliton background . upon considering a lagrangian incorporating resonance degrees of freedom we tried to better understand this issue and concluded that using the @xmath17th order chiral lagrangian augmented by a standard @xmath18th order extension including nonminimal couplings would be sufficient provided a shift away from the experimental values of @xmath8s would be allowed for .",
    "later on , we could add substance to this conclusion by considering the scale dependence of the tree @xmath19 @xmath4-loop soliton mass and the axial coupling constant @xmath20 whose values were shown to be remarkably stable over a wide range of the scale .    starting from this lagrangian",
    ", we devised a method to calculate the self energy of the soliton in the presence of external fields in adiabatic approximation .",
    "in the course of the actual calculation , we had to clear several obstacles only indirectly related to our subject : we clarified the treatment of zero modes in the presence of external fields , showed how to properly compute the tree value of the electric polarizability and calculated the neutron - proton - split of this quantity . in the end questions",
    "remain as to the convergence of the @xmath1 expansion for axial quantities and to the size of the next - to - next - to - leading order contributions . however , we once again want to stress that in @xmath21 out of @xmath22 cases , the @xmath4 loop correction has the right sign and magnitude to compensate for the discrepancy between tree level and experiment , which is truly remarkable since there are only two parameters ( @xmath15 and @xmath23 ) involved ( which moreover have not been tuned to achieve some specific result ) .",
    "the fact that sets @xmath24 and @xmath25 designed to simulate the higher chiral order pieces contained in a vector meson model indeed give much better results than set @xmath26 strongly supports models which include vector mesons explicitly .",
    "we decided to use a pseudoscalar lagrangian only because of the arguments presented in section 2.3 .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that , concerning @xmath4-loop corrections , the results for a lagrangian with explicit @xmath27 and @xmath28 -mesons would come close to those of our model @xmath25 .",
    "in particular the problems with the axial quantities discussed in section 3.3 will probably not be cured by the introduction of vector mesons .",
    "the authors would like to express their gratitude for numerous stimulating discussions with their colleagues g. holzwarth and b. schwesinger .",
    "they are particularly indebted to b. moussallam , who patiently taught them his method to calculate the casimir energy in all details .",

    "although the relation ( [ kir ] ) is model independent , the positivity of the remainder @xmath29 is not a direct implication of the charge algebra .",

    "the contributions @xmath41 and @xmath42 remain small also for finite pion mass .",

    "therefore we do not expect soliton deformations to appreciably contribute to this relation .      in this section",
    "we estimate the @xmath1 contribution to the axial current due to nonadiabatic loops by imposing the ca relation ( a.2 ) . before doing so",

    "the property @xmath51 must then almost entirely be achieved due to the @xmath1 contribution .",
    "the ca commutation relation ( a.2 ) requires b^(-1 ) = - a^(-1),(a^(-1))^2-(g_a^(1 + 0)-c^(-1))a^(-1)+=0 and we may simplify the expression for the axial current ( a.1 ) _ i^a= - g_a^(1 + 0)d_ai + a^(-1 ) , where we replaced @xmath52 according to the scaling behaviour ( a.9 ) .",
