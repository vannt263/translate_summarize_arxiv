    "the problem of computing the stable homotopy groups of spheres is of fundamental importance in algebraic topology .",
    "although this subject has been studied for a very long time , the adams spectral sequence is still the best way to do stemwise computations at the prime 2 .",
    "bruner produced a computer - generated table of @xmath5 differentials in the adams spectral sequence @xcite .",
    "he started with his theorem on the interaction between adams differentials and squaring operations @xcite to obtain several values of the @xmath5 differential .",
    "then he methodically exploited all ( primary ) multiplicative relations , both forwards and backwards , to deduce more and more values of the @xmath5 differential . through at least the 80-stem ,",
    "this procedure gives the vast majority of the values of the @xmath5 differential .",
    "in bruner s approach , the first unknown value is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a certain element in the 52-stem .",
    "this gives a precise sense to the claim that @xmath6 is  harder \" than any previous @xmath5 differential .",
    "mark mahowald communicated ( unpublished ) the following argument for the presence of the differential @xmath0 .",
    "first , there is an element @xmath8 in the @xmath9-stem that detects @xmath10 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.5.1 ) . since @xmath11",
    ", we deduce that @xmath12 detects @xmath13 .",
    "now @xmath14 , so @xmath12 detects @xmath15 .",
    "the final step is the claim that @xmath16 is zero .",
    "this final step turns out to be false ; @xmath16 is detected by @xmath17 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.2.90 ) .",
    "mahowald s mistake arose from an incorrect understanding of the toda bracket @xmath18 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 4.2.91 ) .    in this note , we will repair the hole left by this mistake .",
    "the proof relies on motivic calculations in a fundamental way . in other words",
    ", our argument does not work if applied in the classical context .",
    "we will first establish a massey product involving the element @xmath7 .",
    "then we will apply the higher leibniz rule on the interaction of adams differentials with massey products @xcite .",
    "the second author discovered this proof based on motivic calculations by the first author .",
    "we adopt notation from @xcite without further explanation . for charts of the classical and motivic adams spectral sequences ,",
    "see @xcite .    the higher leibniz rule of moss @xcite is an appealing result that has not been as useful in practice as one might expect . in applications",
    ", indeterminacies often interfere .",
    "the differential that we establish here is an unusually clear application of the higher leibniz rule .",
    "our work suggests that an extension of bruner s program to methodically exploit all @xmath19-fold massey products is likely to lead to further new results about adams @xmath5 differentials .",
    "the origin of this note lies in the first author s analysis of the adams spectral sequence through the 59-stem .",
    "the first author was able to give careful arguments for every adams differential , with the sole exception of possible differentials on the element @xmath7 .",
    "the second author was instrumental in finishing the last remaining differential , whose argument we present here .",
    "the chief consequence of our adams differential calculation is the following results about the stable 51 and 52 stems .",
    "the 2-primary order of the stable 51-stem is 128 . as a group ,",
    "the 2-primary stable 51-stem is either @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "this follows immediately from the adams @xmath22-page .",
    "the first @xmath23 lies in the image of @xmath24 and has a generator that is detected by @xmath25 .",
    "the last @xmath26 is detected by @xmath27 .",
    "the remaining elements are detected by @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "these elements assemble into @xmath23 if there is a hidden @xmath2 extension from @xmath29 to @xmath30 , and they assemble into @xmath31 if there is no hidden @xmath2 extension .    according to @xcite , there is no hidden @xmath2 extension in the stable 51-stem .",
    "however , this claim is inconsistent with other claims in @xcite , as discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 4.1.17 ) .",
    "because of this uncertainty , we leave this 2 extension unresolved .",
    "the 2-primary stable 52-stem is equal to @xmath32 .",
    "this is immediate from the adams @xmath22-page .",
    "according to @xcite , there are no possible hidden @xmath2 extensions .",
    "the crucial calculation is the following lemma which is due to tangora @xcite .",
    "this massey product is proven using the lambda algebra . since the elements @xmath7 and @xmath35 lie beyond the range of the published curtis tables @xcite , tangora used another massey product to deduce that the representative of @xmath7 in the lambda algebra has a leading term @xmath36 .",
    "one can also use unpublished results of mahowald and tangora to see directly that @xmath35 is represented by @xmath37 .",
    "then the massey product follows from @xmath38 .",
    "one can not apply may s convergence theorem @xcite directly to get this massey product from the may differential @xmath39 .",
    "the problem is that there is a  crossing \" may differential @xmath40 that voids the hypotheses of may s convergence theorem .",
    "corollary [ cor : g - bracket ] gives us the massey product @xmath43 in the motivic adams spectral sequence .",
    "using the higher leibniz rule of moss @xcite , we have @xmath44 since there is no indeterminacy . since @xmath45 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3.3.12 ) , we have @xmath46 . in particular , this is nonzero .",
    "then the only possibility is that @xmath0 .          in the classical adams spectral sequence , @xmath49 and @xmath50",
    "are both zero .",
    "this means that our proof is strictly motivic in nature .",
    "we do not know a proof using only the classical adams spectral sequence .    using only classical information",
    ", we suggest a possible argument that @xmath7 does not survive the classical adams spectral sequence .",
    "start with the massey product @xmath51 and the classical differential on @xmath52 .",
    "moss s convergence theorem @xcite then implies that @xmath53 is not a well - formed toda bracket .",
    "the only possibility is that @xmath7 does not survive .",
    "however , that still leaves two possible differentials : @xmath54 , or @xmath55 .",
    "we do not know how to rule out the second alternative using only the classical adams spectral sequence .",
    "mahowald s original argument for the differential @xmath6 used a faulty computation of the toda bracket @xmath56 .",
    "partial information about this toda bracket is used in the construction of a kervaire invariant element @xmath57 in dimension @xmath58 @xcite .",
