    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) has been regarded as one of the enabling technologies in next generation wireless communications@xcite .",
    "considering the large number of antennas at the base station ( bs ) , it becomes almost imperative to rely on the time - division duplexing ( tdd ) channel reciprocity to learn the downlink ( dl ) channel state information ( csi ) from the uplink ( ul ) channel measurements at the bs to avoid the huge overhead for csi feedback as in frequency - division duplexing ( fdd ) systems . even though the antenna array size is large at the bs , each user",
    "is only equipped with a few antennas , e.g. only one antenna .",
    "a user just needs to send one ul pilot sequence per transmit antenna to facilitate the bss to acquire reliable estimates of the corresponding many ul channels from the user to the large antenna array at the bs .    to ensure best csi estimation quality ,",
    "we want to allocate orthogonal ul pilot sequences to different users so that the pilot transmissions do not interfere with each other .",
    "but in reality , within a limited time period and a limited bandwidth , there are only a limited number of orthogonal pilot sequences .",
    "as the number of users becomes large , non - orthogonal pilot sequences are re - used by the users served by different bss , which gives rise to the so - called pilot contamination @xcite and is one limiting factor in multi - cell massive mimo systems .",
    "various approaches have been proposed to alleviate the pilot contamination issue in massive mimo .",
    "recent works include @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite and references therein for a brief overview . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "pilot decontamination was achieved by utilizing the fact that users with non - overlapping angles of arrival ( aoa ) enjoy asymptotic orthogonal covariance matrices . in @xcite ,",
    "aoa diversity and amplitude - based projection were jointly exploited to null the pilot contamination and achieve better channel estimation . a blind singular value decomposition ( svd ) based method was proposed in @xcite to separate the signal subspace from the interference subspace . in @xcite , least - squares ( ls )",
    "channel estimate was derived by treating the blindly detected ul data as pilot symbols and the pilot contamination effect was shown to diminish as the data length grew .",
    "unlike previous studies where a single narrow - band channel was typically assumed , in this paper , we look into the issue of intra - cell pilot orthogonalization and schemes for mitigating the inter - cell pilot contamination with a realistic massive mimo ofdm system model .",
    "first , we examine how to align the power - delay profiles ( pdp , a.k.a .",
    "delay power spectrum in @xcite ) of different users served by one bs so that the pilots sent within one common ofdm symbol are orthogonal . from the aligning rule",
    ", we can see much more users can be sounded in the same ofdm symbol as their channels are sparse in time . in the case of massive mimo , to alleviate the pilot contamination when the schemes in @xcite do not apply well due to interfering users overlapping aoas , we further propose to exploit the fact that different paths in time are associated with different aoas and the pilot contamination can be significantly reduced by aligning the pdps of the users served by different bss appropriately .",
    "thus , pdp aligning can serve as the new baseline design philosophy for massive mimo ul pilots .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section [ secsysmodel ] describes the massive mimo ofdm system model and the channel model .",
    "section [ orthopilot ] provides a sufficient condition for orthogonal pilots design through pdp aligning , which is also applicable to conventional mimo systems .",
    "then we explain how to mitigate the pilot interference in the case of massive mimo by pdp alignment in section [ intfreduction ] .",
