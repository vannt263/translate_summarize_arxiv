    "a fundamental problem in black hole physics is to account for the origin of the outgoing modes . in ordinary field theory",
    "these modes arise from a reservoir of arbitrarily high frequency , short wavelength , degrees of freedom ( in a free - fall frame ) propagating just outside the event horizon and exponentially redshifting until they finally escape .",
    "there are good reasons to doubt the existence of such a transplanckian reservoir however . yet without this reservoir to draw upon , it seems that a short time after the formation of a black hole there would be a dearth of outgoing modes@xcite .",
    "perhaps this is just what happens .",
    "but it would produce a catastrophic breakdown of the usual vacuum structure outside a black hole horizon , would preclude the existence of hawking radiation , and would invalidate any semiclassical analysis of black holes .",
    "while this possibility can perhaps not ( yet ) be ruled out conclusively by observations , it seems terribly unlikely .",
    "underlying this paper is the assumption that the outgoing modes do indeed exist , and the problem is to account for them without drawing upon a reservoir of transplanckian degrees of freedom .",
    "it is easiest to describe the problem in free field terms , where a  mode \" of the field has an autonomous identity , but the problem also exists for interacting fields .",
    "one way to describe it is to think of the interacting theory perturbatively .",
    "then the issue is that , in ordinary field theory , the value of low energy observables far from the hole at late times depends on transplanckian features of the propagator near the horizon@xcite .",
    "nonperturbatively , one can view the field theory as a set of coupled equations for the correlation functions . in this framework",
    ", the operator equations of motion presumably still imply that such observables depend on the transplanckian structure of the correlation functions just outside the horizon .",
    "two good reasons to doubt the existence of a transplanckian reservoir are ( i ) field theory divergences and ( ii ) divergence of black hole entropy in ordinary field theory .",
    "it is generally believed that the short distance divergences of quantum field theory are due to an unphysical assumption about the short distance physics , namely that there are an infinite number of degrees of freedom localizable in any volume , no matter how small that volume may be .",
    "the existence of these degrees of freedom also leads in general to a divergent contribution to the entropy of a black hole .",
    "this can be viewed in terms of entanglement entropy@xcite , or thermal entropy of acceleration radiation@xcite , or simply in terms of the renormalization of newton s constant ( and the coefficients of curvature squared terms in the effective action)@xcite . in this last guise",
    "it appears that the divergence of black hole entropy is merely one aspect of the divergence problem of quantum field theory .",
    "the cure for this problem is to reject the assumption that there exists an infinite density of localizable states .",
    "local lorentz invariance requires that there be an infinite number of degrees of freedom in any volume , no matter how small that volume may be . to evade the conclusion that the density of states is infinite it seems that one must give up either locality or lorentz invariance .",
    "perturbative string theory is an example of a nonlocal theory in which lorentz invariance is maintained but the the density of localizable states is finite ( in fact zero)@xcite . as currently formulated , string theory actually has many _ more _ states than ordinary field theory ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , however each state is fundamentally completely nonlocal .",
    "( there exist conjectures that this is a condensed phase of a more fundamental theory that has a truly finite density of states@xcite . )",
    "the role of this nonlocality in accounting for the outgoing string states around a black hole has not yet to my knowledge been clarified ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "the other possibility is to abandon lorentz invariance rather than locality .",
    "it might be considered foolish to question lorentz invariance .",
    "after all , we certainly have no observations that challenge its validity , and indeed most physicists seem inclined to believe that it is an _",
    "exact _ symmetry of nature .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the lorentz group is noncompact , so it would take observations at arbitrarily large boosts to confirm lorentz invariance .",
    "( at present the upper bound to the boost factors that have been probed is around @xmath0 in transforming to the center of mass frame in cosmic ray collisions . )",
    "of course if lorentz invariance is only an approximate symmetry it will be necessary to explain why it appears to hold so well where it has been tested . in this connection it is interesting to note that effective field theories governed by a lorentzian metric are known to occur in many condensed matter systems where there is actually a preferred frame . if the spacetime metric is of this nature , and if the preferred frame is the cosmic rest frame , then it is clearly relevant that the earth is essentially at rest in this frame .",
    "however , one would still have to explain why we do not see several different effective lorentz metrics for different low energy fields . of possible relevance",
    "is the observation@xcite that there is a tendency for the effective metrics for different interacting fields to flow to a common metric in the infrared .    in this paper",
    "we will consider the consequences of lorentz non - invariance for the issue of the origin of the outgoing modes .",
    "these considerations may also be relevant for a nonlocal theory such as string theory , since non - locally realized lorentz invariance might look somewhat like plain old lorentz non - invariance in some domain .",
    "we shall see that there is a mechanism , operating within the lorentz non - invariant model theories considered , whereby the outgoing modes originate from certain ingoing modes , by a counter - intuitive but rather simple process .",
    "in this section we consider in general terms the question of how the outgoing modes could possibly be restored in a theory with a finite density of states .",
    "this question was raised in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was proposed that a process of  mode regeneration \" must take place , but the nature of this process remained obscure .",
    "it was conjectured that it necessarily involves _",
    "interactions _ , and perhaps corresponds to the time reverse of a decay process in which low frequency outgoing modes fuse to form high frequency ones .",
    "there are ( at least ) two serious objections to this conjecture .",
    "first , one still needs to account for the low frequency outgoing modes , so not much has been explained .",
    "the other objection , pointed out by l. ford@xcite , is that the outcome of such a process would undoubtedly depend on the details of the interactions , for instance on the coupling constants .",
    "the regeneration of the outgoing modes would only be partial , which would be inconsistent with the standard vacuum structure and would lead to violation of the generalized second law because the hole could not emit the full thermal spectrum of hawking radiation .",
    "the only counter argument@xcite was to further conjecture that the regeneration is like an equilibration process , which yields the usual spectrum of vacuum fluctuations provided enough time passes .",
    "however this does not evade the first objection .",
    "how many outgoing modes must be accounted for ?",
    "if the black hole background were static , the number would be infinite , since they could come out at any time .",
    "a black hole left alone would presumably evaporate in a time of order @xmath1 ( in planck units ) , however one can in principle easily maintain the static background by sending energy into the hole at a rate equal to the hawking luminosity .",
    "thus it seems that one must be able to account for a truly infinite number of independent outgoing modes .",
    "supposing that the ultimate density of states is no greater than one per planck volume , it follows that the modes must originate in an infinite volume .- waves , and divide the frequency range into intervals of a small size @xmath2 . below the planck frequency",
    "there are @xmath3 frequency intervals , and each interval defines a wavepacket with time spread @xmath4 . in the evaporation time",
    "@xmath1 there are therefore @xmath5 independent @xmath6-wave modes that emerge .",
    "since the high angular momentum modes have little cross - section for absorption by the hole , the total number of modes should also be of order @xmath1 .",
    "again assuming one planck volume per mode , this requires a total volume @xmath1 .",
    "that is , the minimum distance from the horizon at which the modes can originate is of order @xmath7 . ]",
    "it seems that there are only two ways to account for these outgoing modes without drawing upon a transplanckian reservoir :    1 .",
    "modes may emerge from the singularity and propagate superluminally out across the horizon ; 2 .",
    "ingoing modes may be changed into outgoing ones",
    ".    one can construct dispersive linear field theory models@xcite where either possibility occurs .",
    "the first possibility would require the specification of boundary conditions at the singularity , and does not seem as natural as the second .",
    "( it is not appropriate to reject _ a priori _ the first possibility , since we are questioning lorentz invariance . )",
    "the second possibility probably occurs for a sonic black hole@xcite constructed with real atomic fluid , as will be discussed below .",
    "conversion from ingoing to outgoing modes is a phenomenon that is known in other areas of physics . in plasmas",
    "it is called  mode conversion \" , which occurs when waves propagate in an inhomogenous plasma@xcite . in condensed matter",
    "it is called  andreev relection \" , or  branch conversion \" , which occurs in superfluid systems where the order parameter is position - dependent , such as a normal - superconductor interface@xcite , or a superflow or other  texture \" in superfluid @xmath8he@xcite .",
    "in fact , a simple analog of the outgoing black hole modes is the quasiparticle modes with energy @xmath9 propagating in a normal conductor away from an interface with a superconductor with energy gap @xmath10 .",
    "the origin of these modes is to be found in ingoing quasihole modes which undergo andreev reflection .    in the black hole case ,",
    "certain ingoing short wavelength modes are converted to outgoing short wavelength modes just outside the horizon , which then redshift down to long wavelengths as they climb away from the hole .",
    "these ingoing modes are actually _ outgoing _ as viewed in the free - fall frame of the black hole .",
    "thus , from the viewpoint of a free - fall observer , the conversion does not lead to a deficit of ingoing modes .",
    "mode conversion from ingoing to outgoing modes may provide a satisfactory mechanism for the mode regeneration .",
    "it can happen even in _ free _ field theory , so it does not suffer form ford s objection , it presumably survives in the presence of interaction , and the mechanism is sufficiently universal to account for the outgoing modes in a wide range of theories .",
    "if all outgoing wavepackets can be traced backwards in time to ingoing ones that have never encountered the collapse process which formed the black hole , then for them the black hole spacetime appears stationary .",
    "since killing frequency is conserved , particle creation for them appears impossible .",
    "how can particle creation occur in the presence of a conserved killing frequency ?",
    "the mere existence of a conserved killing frequency is not the problem .",
    "for instance in desitter space , a space of maximal symmetry , ordinary quantum fields are excited even in the killing vacuum@xcite .",
    "this can happen because the killing frequency does not define the relevant notion of particle states .",
    "a black hole spacetime is asymptotically flat , however , and the killing time agrees at infinity with the relevant time for defining the asymptotic particle states ( assuming any preferred frame at infinity is the one in which the black hole is at rest ) .",
    "it would therefore appear there can be no particle production by an eternal stationary black hole .",
    "the annihilation operator @xmath11 for an outgoing positive killing frequency wavepacket would be expressible in terms of the annihilation operator @xmath12 for an ingoing positive killing frequency wavepacket . with the standard in - vacuum boundary condition , @xmath13 , the number @xmath14 would therefore vanish .",
    "three possible escape routes from this no - creation conclusion might be imagined :    1 .",
    "the ingoing modes that give rise to the outgoing modes do _ not _ originate at infinity ; 2 .",
    "quantum field theory breaks down at short distances ; 3 .",
    "the back - reaction destroys the killing symmetry and decoheres positive killing frequency superpositions .    in the presence of a cutoff , as argued above , the modes must originate in an infinite volume , so this escape route ( 1 ) seems precluded due to an  overcrowding \" problem .",
    "the only way out is if the modes were to emerge from the singularity , rather than coming in from infinity .",
    "escape route ( 2 ) is that , as a wavepacket is followed backwards in time out to infinity , it may blueshift so far that the field theory description breaks down .",
    "after that , the connection between  killing frequency at infinity \" and norm in hilbert space might dissolve .",
    "this escape route does nt seem too promising .",
    "while it is plausible that the field theory description breaks down , one would still expect to have a conserved killing energy , and this may be sufficient for a no - creation argument .",
    "escape route ( 3 ) is by far the most promising . in the real problem",
    "the gravitational field is dynamical and couples to all other fields .",
    "the quantum evolution of the coupled system does not preserve the killing symmetry of the classical background .",
    "the high wavevector wavepackets that form the incoming mode are presumably correlated to different states of the gravitational field at short distances , and these states lack the killing symmetry of the background .",
    "furthermore , there is the effect of decoherence . neglecting back - reaction",
    ", the out wavepacket evolves backwards in time to a sum of in wavepackets @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 have positive and negative norms respectively .",
    "it is only the _ sum _ that has positive killing frequency . if the back - reaction is taken into account , the states corresponding to these two wavepackets are presumably correlated to different , perhaps orthogonal , states of the gravitational field . in this case",
    "it would be incorrect simply to sum them together in forming the annihilation operator @xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the conserved norm and @xmath20 is the field operator ) , even if the killing symmetry were preserved .",
    "it seems quite plausible that some combination of these two effects of the back - reaction can evade the stationarity paradox .",
    "indeed there has already been much interesting work on the consequences of the back - reaction on the phase of the bogoliubov coefficients in the hawking effect , and the existence of the kind of decoherence effect being invoked here @xcite .",
    "particularly encouraging is parentani s work which establishes that decoherence due to the back - reaction gives rise to an energy flux from a  uniformly \" accelerated particle detector@xcite or mirror@xcite , even though such systems radiate no energy in the background field approximation@xcite .",
    "( it should be admitted however that in these systems there is a number expectation value for the outgoing modes even in the background field approximation , whereas in our black hole scenario even the number vanishes . )",
    "our conclusion is that it seems possible in principle to produce the hawking radiation even if outgoing modes arise from modes that are ingoing after the collapse that formed the black hole .",
    "in this section we discuss the process of mode conversion in a free field model that violates local lorentz invariance on account of the presence in the action of higher spatial derivative terms in the free - fall frame of a black hole . for simplicity",
    "the model is restricted to two spacetime dimensions .",
    "the model arose from considerations of unruh s sonic black hole analog@xcite , which we now briefly describe .",
    "in unruh s analogy , the perturbations of a stationary background fluid flow are quantized .",
    "if the background flow goes supersonic there is a  sonic horizon \" , from beyond which sound can not escape . equating the sound field to a massless free field ,",
    "unruh argued that the sonic horizon will emit thermal hawking phonons at a temperature @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the gradient of the background velocity field at the horizon .",
    "one can begin to take into account the atomic nature of a real fluid via the departure from linearity of the dispersion relation @xmath23 for phonons@xcite .",
    "the key point is that the slope , which gives the group velocity of wavepackets , is not constant , and in fact initially decreases as @xmath24 increases .",
    "this dispersion relation holds in the co - moving frame of the fluid , and leads to the phenomenon of mode conversion from ingoing to outgoing modes as demonstrated by unruh@xcite .",
    "the model considered in @xcite is not a real fluid but rather free field theory with higher spatial derivative terms designed to produce a non - linear dispersion relation .",
    "unruh s model can be reinterpreted without the fluid flow interpretation as a theory of a free quantum field in a black hole spacetime .",
    "let us describe the model in a slightly generalized form@xcite .",
    "the model consists of a free , hermitian scalar field propagating in a two dimensional black hole spacetime .",
    "the dispersion relation for the field lacks lorentz invariance , and is specified in the free fall frame of the black hole , that is , the frame carried in from the rest frame at infinity by freely falling trajectories .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the unit vector field tangent to the infalling worldlines , and let @xmath26 denote the orthogonal , outward pointing , unit vector , so that @xmath27 .",
    "the action is assumed to have the form : @xmath28 where the modified differential operator @xmath29 is defined by @xmath30 the time derivatives in the local free fall frame are thus left unchanged , but the orthogonal spatial derivatives are replaced by @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath32 determines the dispersion relation .",
    "invariance of the action ( [ action ] ) under constant phase transformations of @xmath33 guarantees that there is a conserved current for solutions and a conserved  inner product \" for pairs of solutions to the equations of motion .",
    "the black hole line element we shall consider is static and has the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is negative and increasing to the right , going to a constant @xmath36 at infinity .",
    "the black hole is at rest in these coordinates if @xmath37 vanishes .",
    "this is a generalization of the lematre line element for the schwarzschild spacetime , which is given by @xmath38 ( together with the usual angular part ) .",
    "@xmath39 is a killing vector , of squared norm @xmath40 , and the event horizon is located at @xmath41 .",
    "the curves given by @xmath42 are timelike free fall worldlines which are at rest ( tangent to the killing vector ) where @xmath43 .",
    "since we assume @xmath44 these are _ ingoing _ trajectories .",
    "@xmath45 is their coordinate velocity , @xmath46 measures proper time along them , and they are everywhere orthogonal to the constant @xmath46 surfaces",
    ". we shall refer to the function @xmath35 as the _ free - fall velocity_. the asymptotically flat region corresponds to @xmath47 .    in terms of the notation above",
    ", the orthonormal basis vectors adapted to the free fall frame are given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and and in these coordinates @xmath50 .",
    "thus the action ( [ action ] ) becomes @xmath51 if we further specify that @xmath52 is an odd function of @xmath53 , then integration by parts yields the field equation @xmath54    the behavior of wavepackets in this model can be understood qualitatively as follows .",
    "assume a solution to the field equation ( [ eom ] ) of the form @xmath55 and solve the resulting ode for @xmath56 by the wkb approximation .",
    "that is , write @xmath57 and assume the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 are negligible compared to @xmath24 .",
    "the resulting equation is the position - dependent dispersion relation @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "this is just the dispersion relation in the local free - fall frame , since the free - fall frequency @xmath62 is related to the killing frequency @xmath63 by @xmath64    the choice of the function @xmath65 completes the definition of the model .",
    "the ordinary wave equation corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "expanding in @xmath24 , one has @xmath67 ( assuming reflection invariance ) .",
    "the wavevector @xmath68 characterizes the scale of ` new physics ' .",
    "the only qualitative choice being made here is that the cubic term is negative . in many condensed matter systems",
    "the dispersion relation behaves in this way , and it is necessary in order that ( for an interacting field ) the excitations be stable against decay into longer wavelength ones@xcite .",
    "the group velocity in the free - fall frame is @xmath69 , which decreases initially ( at least ) as the wavevector grows .",
    "this decrease in the group velocity is the essential feature for us .",
    "unruh s choice@xcite for the function @xmath65 was @xmath70\\}^{1\\over n } \\label{fun}\\ ] ] for various integers @xmath71 .",
    "for every @xmath71 this has the feature that the group velocity vanishes for large wavevectors and the frequency approaches a maximum .",
    "this dispersion relation is in some ways like the dispersion relation for superfluid helium-4 , with the roton minimum taken out .",
    "( other choices for @xmath65 are studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but these will not be discussed here . ) this dispersion relation is plotted in fig .",
    "[ disps ] along with the dispersion relations for the ordinary wave equation and for quasiparticle excitations of superfluid helium-4 .",
    "the dispersion relation is useful for understanding the motion of wavepackets that are somewhat peaked in both position and wavevector .",
    "the change in position can be found by integrating the group velocity @xmath72 while satisfying the dispersion relation ( [ disp ] ) .",
    "a graphical method we have employed is described in refs .",
    "the same method was used by bmps@xcite , who also found a hamiltonian formulation for the wavepacket propagation using hamilton - jacobi theory .    the model with the dispersion relation ( [ fun ] )",
    "was solved in ref .",
    "@xcite by numerical integration of the pde ( [ eom ] ) , and the results can be reproduced qualitatively by the wkb methods . propagating a low wavevector outgoing wavepacket backwards in time , the horizon is approached , the wavevector blueshifts to something of order @xmath68 , and the group velocity drops to zero in the static frame .",
    "mode conversion occurs near the stopping point@xcite , and the wavepacket moves back away from the horizon with large positive and negative wavevector components .",
    "( forwards in time these components are ingoing in the static frame but outgoing in the free - fall frame .",
    "this happens because their group velocity in the free - fall frame is smaller in magnitutde than @xmath35 on account of the flattening of the dispersion curve at large wavevectors . )",
    "these have positive and negative free - fall frequencies and ( therefore ) positive and negative norms respectively .",
    "the magnitude of the component wavevectors grows without bound as the wavepacket moves outward where @xmath35 decreases , and the asymptotic group velocity is just @xmath35 . were @xmath35 to drop to zero , the wavevector would diverge . to avoid dealing with this one",
    "can impose the in - vacuum in the free - fall frame at nonzero @xmath35 .",
    "( this was done in @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "no matter how small @xmath45 gets , the same result is obtained for the ( negative ) norm of the negative wavevector piece , which is the bogoliubov coefficient that determines the particle creation amplitude for the outgoing wavepacket .",
    "thus , even though the difference between the free - fall and killing frames is going to zero as @xmath45 goes to zero , the wavevector is diverging in such a way that the wavepacket always maintains a negative free - fall frequency part of the same , negative , norm .    from this analysis",
    "we see that the unruh model , while it entails a strict cutoff in free - fall frequency , involves in an essential way arbitrarily high wavevectors , i.e. , arbitrarily short wavelengths .",
    "insofar as we wish to explore the consequences of a fundamental short distance cutoff , this is an unsatisfactory feature of the model .",
    "the outgoing modes emerging from the black hole region still arise from arbitrarily short wavelength modes , albeit ingoing ones .",
    "for a physical model with a strict cutoff let us consider the behavior of liquid helium at zero temperature .",
    "this is of course an interacting system , so is not nearly as simple as the unruh model . nevertheless , is is possible to make some reasonable conjectures based on the form of the quasiparticle spectrum in fig .",
    "[ disps ] .",
    "( to avoid the need to consider interactions , one might study instead field theory on a lattice falling into a black hole . ) in discussing the helium model , it is natural to go back to unruh s original sonic analogy and think of the free - fall velocity @xmath35 as the velocity of the background fluid flow . to begin with ,",
    "let us ignore the existence of interactions and just follow modes as if they were free .    in @xcite",
    "it was argued that in the helium model a long wavelength outgoing wavepacket , traced backward in time , would come to rest at an  effective horizon \" where the co - moving group velocity and fluid velocity are equal and opposite . for this part of the process ,",
    "the difference between the helium dispersion relation and that of the unruh model ( [ fun ] ) is irrelevant , so unruh s results@xcite , as well as those of @xcite and @xcite , show that this expectation is incorrect .",
    "rather , the blueshifting continues , the group velocity continues to drop , and the wavepacket is swept back out away from the sonic horizon as a superposition of positive and negative wavevector packets .",
    "now let us continue to follow the progress of , say , the positive wavevector part , backward in time , using the dispersion relation of liquid helium .",
    "the idea is sketched in fig .",
    "[ dance ] .",
    "( the behavior of the negative wavevector part is similar . )",
    "the packet will go over the first maximum of the dispersion curve , at which point its co - moving group velocity changes sign , which only pushes it away from the horizon even faster .",
    "eventually , however , it approaches another turn around point , near the roton minimum , where the free - fall frequency line becomes tangent once again to the dispersion curve .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that what happens here is another reversal of direction , with the wavepacket continuing along the dispersion curve and falling back towards the horizon .",
    "as the wavevector rises and group velocity falls one more tangency point will be reached , where there is presumably one final reversal of direction .",
    "after that ( still backward in time ) , the wavepacket heads back away from the horizon with still blueshifting wavevector and finally runs off the end of the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "the quasiparticle spectrum terminates when a decay channel into two rotons opens up , at twice the momentum and energy of the roton minimum@xcite .",
    "therefore , it appears that our outgoing mode originates as some two roton mode ( with vanishing co - moving group velocity ) that is swept in by the flow .",
    "that is , the number operator for outgoing long wavelength phonons is dynamically related to the 4-point function for ingoing rotons .",
    "we were forced to incorporate the interactions when the end of the quasiparticle spectrum was reached , but of course the interactions play some role all along that we have ignored .",
    "one way to think about this is to ask about the stability of quasiparticles .",
    "if other decay channels are kinematically available , then presumably these are mixed in to the evolution of the vacuum correlation functions .",
    "there are indeed two regions of the quasiparticle spectrum that are unstable besides the endpoint .",
    "first , there is  anomalous dispersion \" at low wavevectors , where @xmath73 is actually positive rather than negative@xcite , which leads to a finite phonon lifetime@xcite .",
    "second , past the roton minimum , there is a region where the group velocity just reaches the velocity of sound@xcite , leading to phonon emission .",
    "the existence of these processes presumably implies a mixing of the multipoint vacuum correlation functions .",
    "thus an outgoing phonon mode really arises from a superposition of various numbers of phonon modes , each of which ultimately arises from ingoing multi - roton modes .    in summary , we thus conjecture the following forward in time behavior . as particular superpositions of multi - roton modes of the superfluid are swept in towards the horizon , the interactions and velocity gradient conspire to turn them ( after some dancing around near the horizon ) into outgoing phonon modes which are in ( or very nearly in ) their ground state .",
    "at this point the hawking effect is responsible for populating them thermally as they climb away from the horizon .",
    "the negative energy flux across the horizon which is required by energy conservation must leave the superfluid in a state with lower energy density than the homogeneous superfluid ground state .",
    "in fact , the true behavior of helium in the presence of a sonic horizon is complicated by the instability towards vortex and roton creation . in this connection",
    "it is interesting to note that a periodic roton condensate will develop@xcite at a critical velocity @xmath74 m / s which is much less than the velocity of sound ( 238 m / s ) in helium .",
    "perhaps this phase transition is essential to understanding the energy balance in the presence of the sonic hawking effect in helium .",
    "finally , we point out that in the models considered here , it appears that the presence of a cutoff and violation of lorentz invariance does not change the picture with regard to information loss in black hole evaporation",
    ". the created particles still have a  partner\"@xcite , which falls down into the singularity , to whom they are correlated .",
    "we see no mechanism for recovering the information in those correlations based on these models .",
