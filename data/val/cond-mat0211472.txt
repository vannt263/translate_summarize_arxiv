    "in recent years the study of stochastic systems has become an attractive and important research field in modern statistical physics .",
    "this is mainly based on the fact that in particular a lot of interdisciplinary problems are described best by probabilistic models .",
    "in addition , many stochastic processes represent simple nonequilibrium systems and may serve as a kind of toy models for the evaluation of a still outstanding nonequilibrium theory .    in this work we focus on the asymmetric random average process ( arap ) @xcite .",
    "the model is defined on a lattice and equipped with a probabilistic nearest neighbour interaction .",
    "this is in common with most stochastic models , especially with the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) , e.g. , @xcite and references therein , representing somewhat like a standard model of nonequilibrium physics .",
    "however , the state variables of the arap located at the lattice sites are continuous and unbounded while most of the models known deal with discrete and even finite local state spaces .    nevertheless , the arap is not an artificial construction .",
    "many physical problems are rather located in continuous than in discrete space .",
    "e.g. , it is closely related with the q - model of granular media @xcite . the traffic model of krauss @xcite",
    "can also be mapped onto the arap @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the arap may show some new phenomena undiscovered in discrete systems so far , e.g. , in @xcite a new kind of twofoldly broken ergodicity has been studied .",
    "the results presented in this paper are structured as follows .    in section [ ch_definition ]",
    "we give a definition of the arap in context of the so - called quantum formalism of stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "this is useful for the application of the matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) presented in section [ ch_mpa ] .    in sections",
    "[ ch_pms ] and [ ch_mpa ] we focus on araps with interactions leading to factorized steady states . in @xcite these interactions",
    "have been identified , however , the calculation was not rigorously and involved a unproven conjecture . according to this , we complete the outstanding proof in section [ ch_pms ] .",
    "furthermore , we derive an _ explicit _ functional representation of the interactions , so - called beta densities , and discuss the influence of finite system sizes .",
    "finally , in section [ ch_mpa ] we apply the matrix product ansatz to araps with interactions identified in the previous section .",
    "this approach has been successfully developed for quantum spin chains and stochastic systems in the last decade ( see section [ ch_mpa ] for references ) , however , it has always been applied to systems with discrete state variables . here",
    "we enhance its validity to systems with continuous state spaces .",
    "the corresponding algebras become compact functional equations with closed solutions .    in the conclusion",
    "we discuss the mpa for araps with interactions that do not lead to product measure steady states .",
    "the arap is defined on a 1d periodic lattice with @xmath0 sites .",
    "each site @xmath1 carries a non - negative continuous mass variable @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics is given in discrete time and every time step @xmath3 for each site a random number @xmath4 $ ] is generated from a time - independent probability density function @xmath5 , called _",
    "fraction density_. the fraction @xmath6 determines the amount of mass @xmath7 transported from site @xmath1 to site @xmath8 .",
    "the transport is completely asymmetric , i.e. , no mass moves in the opposite direction @xmath9 , and we obtain @xmath10 these update rules correspond to a parallel dynamics and are illustrated in figure [ modelbase_fig ] .",
    "so there are only three parameters in the arap : first , the system size @xmath0 and the mass density @xmath11 whereby @xmath12 represents the total mass . due to mass conserving dynamics",
    "the density is fixed and accordingly @xmath13 can be considered as a thermodynamic variable .",
    "however , the most powerful `` parameter '' is given by the fraction density @xmath14 which allows the arap to be customized to a lot of interdisciplinary problems . in @xcite",
    "some stochastic models have been rewritten in context of the arap by the use of suitable @xmath14-functions , e.g. , the q - model from granular media or the krauss - model from traffic flow theory .    now the arap will be presented in terms of the so - called quantum formalism for stochastic processes , e.g. , used in @xcite .",
    "we consider the orthonormal state space which is spanned by the continuous ket basis @xmath15 with configuration vectors @xmath16 and equipped with the inner product @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 represents the @xmath18-function ) .",
    "correspondingly states of the arap at time @xmath19 are given by    @xmath20    whereby @xmath21 is a non - negative probability measure or reworded : @xmath22 gives the probability density of finding the system in the configuration @xmath23 at time @xmath19 . here",
    "the abbreviated form @xmath24 with @xmath25 has been introduced .",
    "furthermore we assume @xmath26 to be normalized , i.e. @xmath27 .    our main aim is to calculate the function @xmath26 which corresponds to the solution of the problem . in case of the parallel dynamics given above",
    "we obtain the following @xmath28 map of the basis : @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 here @xmath32 represents an @xmath33 matrix with diagonal elements @xmath34 and lower band entries @xmath6 . based on periodic boundary conditions",
    "the top right entry is also unequal to zero , i.e. @xmath35 . so @xmath36 is nothing else than the compact matrix formulation of ( [ mass_update ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath32 operates on the space of configuration vectors @xmath23 , whereas @xmath37 operates on the state space spanned by @xmath38 .",
    "evaluating @xmath39 by using the relations ( [ state]),([par_upd_basis ] ) and ( [ t_matrix ] ) we finally obtain the master equation @xmath40 representing the fundamental dynamical equation of the arap . here the expression @xmath41 represents the transition probability density from state @xmath38 into state @xmath42 .",
    "from now on we would like to focus on steady state dynamics only , i.e. , we look for time - independent solutions @xmath43 of ( [ mgl_par ] ) .",
    "this simplifies the master equation to the eigenvalue problem @xmath44 . for ergodic",
    "araps , defined by dynamics that allow the system to evolve from any given initial state to any final state in a finite time , the steady state is equal to the infinite time limit , so @xmath45 .",
    "although we do not focus on araps with discrete masses or other kind of updates in this paper , we would like to mention that it is straightforward to deduce the corresponding master equations from ( [ mgl_par ] ) .",
    "e.g. , the discrete arap is embedded canonically by using @xmath18-functions , whereas araps with continuous time dynamics can be treated by a suitable chosen fraction density that interpolates between parallel and random sequential ( = continuous time ) updates .",
    "both cases are explicitly treated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we do not take into account systems with state - dependent fraction densities , e.g. , given by @xmath46 ( here the probability of mass shifts also depends on the height of the column ) .",
    "although these araps may show interesting phenomena @xcite , an analytical treatment is more difficult in general .",
    "so , the arap with continuous state variables , discrete parallel update and state - independent fraction density @xmath47 spans an appropriate framework for analytical research .",
    "we hope that a lot of results can be transferred to related araps in a next step .",
    "in this section the complete set of araps with product measure solutions @xmath48 is presented , i.e. , we determine rigorously the set @xmath49 of all @xmath14-functions leading to factorized mass distributions .",
    "basically , we complete the proof of @xcite which includes a conjecture based on high order computations so far .",
    "furthermore , the fraction densities of @xmath49 are given in a closed form in contrast to our previous paper @xcite where the @xmath14-functions are in moment representation only .",
    "finally , we briefly discuss the influence of the system size @xmath0 .      in @xcite",
    "it is shown by a constructive approach that @xmath49 is a two parametric set of @xmath14-functions , determined by the first and second @xmath14-moments @xmath50 and @xmath51 which are defined by @xmath52 .",
    "these free parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 have to be chosen with respect to the general moment properties @xmath53 only . then the higher moments are uniquely determined by @xmath50 and @xmath51 through @xmath54 with @xmath55    from now on we neglect for simplicity the special case @xmath56 corresponding to @xmath57 and leading to product measure solutions generated by @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , these singular @xmath18-densities will not be considered as elements of @xmath49 . for completeness",
    "we present the factorized mass densities associated with ( [ moment_criterion ] ) , also deduced in @xcite : @xmath59    please note that the _ uniqueness _ of the higher moments @xmath60 has already been proven in @xcite . correspondingly , the densities given above span the complete set @xmath49 .",
    "however , the explicit form ( [ moment_criterion ] ) is a conjecture that has only been shown rigorously for @xmath61 . according to this ,",
    "our approach in this section is canonical : we first derive explicitly the fraction densities related to ( [ moment_criterion ] ) and after that we show that these @xmath14-functions really lead to factorized mass distributions .",
    "this will complete the outstanding proof .",
    "we start by rewriting ( [ moment_criterion ] ) as a recurrence relation : @xmath62 then we define the generating function @xmath63 from @xmath64 we derive that @xmath65 is an entire function and consequently well defined .",
    "in addition , the relation @xmath66 holds and @xmath67 is the characteristic function of @xmath14 .    from ( [ rec_moment_criterion ] ) and ( [ char_func_phi ] ) the differential equation @xmath68 is derived after some algebra which is nothing else than kummer s equation @xcite .",
    "this ordinary differential equation of second order is elaborated very well , e.g. , it appears in context of the hydrogen atom , and so we may rely on a huge pool of known results @xcite .",
    "for linear differential equations of second order there are always two independent solutions . but here , only one of them , the so - called kummer m - function @xmath69 , is analytical in @xmath70 as long as @xmath71 is not a negative integer .",
    "this is ensured by ( [ parameter_space ] ) and ( [ moment_criterion_lambda ] ) .",
    "consulting @xcite yields for the special case @xmath72 , which is also satisfied here , the integral representation @xmath73 which finally gives an explicit representation of @xmath14 by comparison with ( [ char_func_phi_2 ] ) .    at last ,",
    "this functional solution is rewritten in terms of parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 instead of @xmath71 and @xmath76 to simplify the representation of @xmath49 . by the transformation @xmath77 and",
    "@xmath78 a symmetric form of the fraction densities is achieved and we get @xmath79 these are so - called beta densities which are very common in probability theory @xcite . at this",
    ", the normalization constant is given by the beta function @xmath80    although the mean field models ( [ mcont_def ] ) are parameterized by a two - dimensional manifold , the associated mass distributions ( [ mfsol_p ] ) are connected to a one - dimensional parameter space only , i.e. , several @xmath81 functions yield identical stationary states with @xmath82",
    ". however , we have to keep in mind that this conclusion concerns only the steady state .",
    "the relaxation into the stationary state could differ completely .",
    "now we briefly discuss the product measure araps ( [ mcont_def ] ) into more detail .",
    "in dependence of the fraction density the process may behave from even critical ( @xmath83 ) to deterministic ( @xmath84 ) . here",
    "critical araps are characterized by an algebraic mass decay @xcite .",
    "they are realized by dynamics that either shift the total mass located on a lattice site or forbid the transport .",
    "in general , there are three classes of @xmath49-densities : continuous functions with @xmath85 , single peak functions with @xmath86 or @xmath87 and double peak functions with @xmath88 .",
    "only double peak functions may result into mass densities @xmath89 that diverge for @xmath90 .",
    "this reflects an almost critical behaviour because either transports of no mass ( @xmath91 ) or the total mass ( @xmath92 ) are preferred .",
    "however , all classes may generate gaussian - like mass densities with an algebraic increase for small masses .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting that continuous and single peak densities , resp .",
    "single and double peak densities , may lead to identical mass distributions , whereas , this is impossible in case of continuous and double peak araps .    for @xmath93",
    "we obtain the simplest version of the arap with uniform distribution @xmath94 .",
    "we will refer to this system as the free arap .",
    "in particular , there is no explicit truncation which can forbid or suppress a transport of fractions bigger than a critical value , e.g. discussed in @xcite .",
    "now we prove that the densities ( [ mcont_def ] ) really lead to factorized mass distributions according to ( [ mfsol_p ] ) . in @xcite",
    "a simple criterion has been presented which makes it possible to determine and verify mean field solutions : only product measure mass densities ( [ pmsols ] ) satisfy the equation @xmath95 with @xmath96 and single site laplace - transform @xmath97 .",
    "hence , ( [ cond2_q ] ) represents a sufficient criterion for testing the validity of product measure solutions . in the following paragraphs",
    "we will show that the mass densities ( [ mfsol_p ] ) meet the condition ( [ cond2_q ] ) .",
    "the laplace - transform of ( [ mfsol_p ] ) is given by @xmath98 then , using ( [ mcont_def ] ) and ( [ mfsol_q ] ) with ( [ mapping ] ) leads to @xmath99 \\right)^{\\lambda } } \\;.\\ ] ] evaluation of the r.h.s .",
    "of ( [ mapping_here ] ) can be done by use of the so - called feynman parameters which are a well - known tool in field theory .",
    "they are nothing else than the formula @xmath100 here @xmath101 are real and positive , whereas @xmath102 may be complex .",
    "a derivation of ( [ feynman_parameters ] ) is given in @xcite .",
    "now we simply apply the values @xmath103 integrate over @xmath104 , relabel @xmath105 , and finally equation ( [ feynman_parameters ] ) rereads as @xmath106 \\right)^{\\lambda } } \\;.\\ ] ] together with ( [ mapping_here ] ) we derive @xmath107 from this follows directly the validity of condition ( [ cond2_q ] ) which completes the proof .",
    "the formula ( [ feynman_parameters ] ) has already successfully been used in context of the q - model @xcite . as mentioned in the introduction this fundamental process of granular media",
    "is strongly related with the arap .",
    "however , only symmetric araps defined by symmetric fraction densities @xmath108 can be mapped onto the q - model @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the application of feynman parameters has been generalized to antisymmetric @xmath14-functions here .",
    "the calculations in @xcite have only been focused on systems in the thermodynamic limit @xmath109 .",
    "but , also in case of finite systems the mean - field criterion ( [ cond2_q ] ) is valid and sufficient which can be shown in almost the same manner as done in @xcite .",
    "so araps with beta densities are of product measure form irrespective of the system size @xmath0 .",
    "however , for @xmath110 the configuration space is restricted to the hyperplane @xmath111 due to mass conserving dynamics .",
    "accordingly , the mass density has to be renormalized and we obtain @xmath112 with @xmath113 thus , projection onto the @xmath114 surface , i.e. fixing the total mass , corresponds to shifting our focus from grand - canonical to a canonical point of view whereby @xmath115 corresponds to the canonical partition sum .",
    "a detailed calculation of @xmath115 is given in [ z_prove ] .",
    "one should keep in mind that the exact solutions ( [ p_finite ] ) are still of product measure form if restricted to @xmath114 .",
    "however , this coincidence with the @xmath116 case is only formal , e.g. , the one - site mass density is _ not _ simply given by @xmath117 .",
    "one has to take into account the additional interaction induced by the restriction @xmath118 .",
    "so we derive by using the relation ( [ z_relation ] ) again :    @xmath119",
    "in this section we solve araps with @xmath49-densities by using a matrix product ansatz ( mpa ) .",
    "this technique has been initially introduced for calculating exact ground states of quantum spin chains @xcite .",
    "shortly after , derrida and coworkers have successfully applied the mpa to a nonequilibrium system , namely the asep with random sequential dynamics @xcite . meanwhile the mpa has been evolved to a standard tool for one - dimensional stochastic models , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , its field of application so far is mainly restricted to variants of the asep ( different updates , local defects or two species of particles ) .    in general the mpa",
    "is applied to systems defined on a two - dimensional local state space , i.e. , sites can be vacant or occupied . in this case , manageable sets of algebraic objects ( corresponding to the local states ) and algebraic relations ( reflecting the local dynamics ) are obtained .",
    "for example the asep provides one condition , @xmath120 , where the objects @xmath121 and @xmath122 correspond to holes and particles . nevertheless , it is rather complicated to find ( matrix ) representations of that poorly defined algebra @xcite .",
    "an extension to a model with an arbitrary , but still finite , number of local states is given in @xcite .    here",
    "we apply the mpa to a stochastic system with _ continuous _ state variables .",
    "as seen in the previous section , mean field is exact for fraction densities taken from @xmath49 , i.e. , the corresponding algebras have one - dimensional representations and are given by a functional equation .",
    "we derive mass solutions in agreement with the results given in section [ ch_pms ] .",
    "so an alternative approach for the calculation of steady states is presented in this paper .",
    "this may show new perspectives in the treatment of other araps which are unsolved so far .",
    "e.g. , the free arap with continuous time update still lacks an exact description of the steady state .",
    "also the state - dependent models given by mass - dependent fraction densities @xmath46 could be treated by the mpa .",
    "finally , our work extends the scope of the mpa to systems with unbounded and continuous state spaces !",
    "thus , we have to deal with functions and functional equations instead of discrete objects . for this",
    ", we may fall back on the well elaborated field of functional theory .",
    "so , although things get in principal more complex  measured in degrees of freedom ",
    "life becomes easier .      in this section",
    "we derive the matrix algebra of the arap in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we start with the `` defect '' matrix product ansatz for backward sequential dynamics @xcite .",
    "a definition of the backward sequential update is presented in the [ bs ] whereas a detailed introduction to the mpa for stochastic systems can be found in the references given in the introduction of this section .",
    "therefore , we assume the local interaction to obey @xmath123 with @xmath124 here @xmath125 spans the infinite and continuous local state space of a single site and the tensor product is defined as usual , i.e. @xmath126 whereby we have used @xmath127 .",
    "this is in accordance with the notation introduced in section [ ch_definition ] .",
    "note that the algebraic objects @xmath122 and @xmath128 depend on a continuous parameter @xmath129 reflecting the mass located on a lattice site .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath130 represents a steady state under backward sequential dynamics @xmath131 the operator @xmath132 is defined by the local interaction @xmath19 acting on sites @xmath1 and @xmath8 . for further information about update procedures please refer to @xcite .",
    "note that trace operator @xmath133 and time evolution operator @xmath134 commute because @xmath133 acts on the auxiliary space of the algebraic objects whereas @xmath134 is defined on the state space . here",
    "the trace operator shall ensure translational invariance of the steady state .    in the thermodynamic limit the parallel update corresponds to the backward sequential update ( see [ bs ] ) , so the defect can be neglected and we obtain @xmath135    now we give the explicit definition of the local dynamics .",
    "first , we change notation ( or , more formal , the basis ) uniquely in the following way @xmath136 because the local dynamics is mass conserving",
    ". then , the representation of the local interaction reads as follows : @xmath137 here @xmath138 represents the so - called fragment density , giving the probability ( density ) that a fragment of size @xmath139 is broken of a stick with mass @xmath129 .",
    "the densities @xmath138 and @xmath14 are simply related by @xmath140    using ( [ mpa_d])([dotp ] ) with ( [ basis_c])([f_def ] ) yields after some calculation the matrix algebra in form of a functional equation : @xmath141 for a detailed derivation we refer to [ app_alg ] .",
    "please note that we are confronted with _ one condition _ and _ two objects _ only .",
    "this is remarkable due to the immense degrees of freedom . in discrete systems",
    "every local state corresponds to a single algebraic object , e.g. , in the asep we deal with an object @xmath121 for empty sites and @xmath122 for occupied sites .",
    "accordingly , unbounded local state spaces yield an infinite number of algebraic objects .",
    "additionally , the number of conditions derived from the local dynamics and defining relations between the algebraic objects depends quadratically on the number of local states .",
    "so , increasing the degrees of local freedom makes it more difficult to find representations of the algebraic objects that fulfill all conditions .",
    "even more fascinating is that in case of continuous system things become easier again !",
    "the algebraic objects condense to functions and many conditions summarize in one functional equation .",
    "in general @xmath143 and @xmath144 are arbitrary algebraic objects and sometimes it is possible to derive information about the underlying system without finding a concrete representation , e.g. , this has been done for the asep in @xcite where some quantities like the flux have been calculated by recurrently solving the algebraic relations . usually one tries to find a matrix representation fulfilling the dynamical conditions .",
    "here one distinguishes one - dimensional and higher dimensional representations because one - dimensional representations correspond to product measure solutions ( [ pmsols ] ) always , whereas higher dimensional solutions incorporate additional correlations and show that the process can not be solved by a mean field ansatz .    in this subsection",
    "we will focus on araps with @xmath142-functions , i.e. @xmath145 , given by @xmath146 and part of the class @xmath49 . without any further input from section [ ch_pms ] we will derive the according mass densities by the matrix product technique , i.e. , by solving the algebraic equation ( [ algebra_c ] ) .",
    "since we are looking for product measure solutions , we assume a one - dimensional representation of @xmath122 and @xmath128 . even without knowing that such solutions exist",
    ", one would always try to solve a problem by the simplest ansatz .",
    "if this approach fails , we would look for higher dimensional representations .",
    "this means that @xmath122 and @xmath128 are nothing else than _ functions _ with one real parameter .",
    "in particular , @xmath122 and @xmath128 commute and we assume them to be differentiable .    using @xmath142 with ( [ algebra_c ] ) we obtain @xmath147 then differentiating with respect to @xmath129 generates after rearrangement @xmath148 a differential equation with two functions and two variables @xmath149 and @xmath129 .",
    "for @xmath150 the explicit @xmath75-dependence vanishes and ( [ diff_2v_c ] ) reduces to @xmath151   = \\frac{1}{m } \\;.\\ ] ] directly the relation @xmath152 is obtained .",
    "inserting this solution in ( [ diff_2v_c ] ) enables us to extract @xmath122 from the algebra and after some calculus we derive @xmath153 with @xmath154 for the free arap , i.e. @xmath155 , the r.h.s .  of ( [ rel_e ] )",
    "is equal to zero .",
    "then @xmath156 has to be constant because ( [ rel_e ] ) has to be valid for all @xmath157 .",
    "thus , we get @xmath158 . for arbitrary @xmath75",
    "we rewrite the r.h.s .  of ( [ rel_e ] ) by expansion into partial fractions and",
    "achieve the difference equation @xmath159 its general and unique solution is given by @xmath160 ( at this we used the same argument as for the @xmath155 case ) . by the help of definition ( [ def_h ] ) we obtain @xmath161 and",
    "finally @xmath162 by ( [ rel_d_e ] ) .    in case of a one - dimensional solution",
    "the trace operator in ( [ p_d ] ) becomes redundant and the identity @xmath163 is valid .",
    "using the boundary conditions @xmath164 and @xmath165 , we determine the constants @xmath166 and @xmath167 and obtain the single - site mass density @xmath168 which is in perfect accordance with ( [ mfsol_p ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the matrix product ansatz offers a big advantage compared to other approaches dealing with product measure solutions : we do not have to prove the exactness of the solution ( [ mpasol ] ) .",
    "usually one assumes the master equation to be solved by a solution of type ( [ pmsols ] ) , i.e. , we make a so - called mean - field ansatz and look for solutions @xcite .",
    "the next step is to show that the mean - field ansatz is really correct , i.e. , we have to prove that all higher correlations or joint probability densities decompose .",
    "although in @xcite this extensive task has been reduced by deduction of the criterion ( [ cond2_q ] ) , the step of testing remains : mean - field solutions have to satisfy ( [ cond2_q ] ) for all @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "however , in case of the matrix product technique the proof of exactness is delivered for free .",
    "the construction of the steady state ensures its exactness ( see subsection [ ch_algebra ] ) and the dimensionality of the representation gives information about the correlations .      here the matrix algebra for beta densities with arbitrary @xmath75 and @xmath171",
    "is considered . as in the previous section",
    "we derive the corresponding differential equations involving @xmath122 and @xmath128 , however , these become more complex and we have to treat them for each @xmath74 separately .",
    "we present the @xmath172 case in detail and refer to the problems in finding closed solutions for arbitrary @xmath74 .",
    "starting point is ( [ algebra_c ] ) with fraction densities ( [ mcont_def ] ) . introducing @xmath173 we rewrite the functional equation to @xmath174 now we assume @xmath74 to be integer and derive the relation @xmath175 for further information please consult [ app_abl ] .",
    "so , by an @xmath74 times differentiation the integral expression disappears and combination of ( [ func2 ] ) and ( [ rel_der ] ) yields the equation @xmath176 = ( -)^a \\frac{\\gamma(a+b)}{\\gamma(b ) }   m^{1-(a+b ) } d(m ) \\bar{d}(s - m ) \\;.\\ ] ] for @xmath145 we obtain ( [ diff_2v_c ] ) . defining @xmath177 , evaluating the expression on the l.h.s . of ( [ diff_1 ] ) and setting @xmath178 results in @xmath179 here the upper index denotes the @xmath180 derivative .",
    "thus , equation ( [ dgl ] ) represents a homogeneous linear differential equation of order @xmath74 in @xmath122 and @xmath181 respectively . in terms of @xmath182",
    "it is even nonlinear .",
    "henceforth , one may apply the following strategy as done in the previous section : first we try to solve ( [ dgl ] ) in @xmath128 , i.e. , we obtain a relation @xmath183 .",
    "then , we insert this result into ( [ diff_1 ] ) , obtain an equation with @xmath128 only and try to solve it .",
    "however , this approach becomes more difficult for @xmath184 because the corresponding differential equations are more complex .",
    "as an example , we would like to discuss the case @xmath172 into detail .",
    "for this ( [ dgl ] ) transforms into @xmath185 to simplify ( [ dgl_2 ] ) we make use of the substitutions @xmath186 and @xmath187 so that a nonlinear differential equation of first order is achieved finally : @xmath188 + \\left [ d(m ) - g(m ) \\right]^2 = \\frac{b(1+b)}{m^2 } \\;.\\ ] ] unfortunately , we are not able to give a general solution of ( [ diff_2 ] ) representing a riccati equation in @xmath189 @xcite .",
    "this is based on the fact that @xmath190 is also an unknown function .",
    "therefore , we can not apply elaborated solution schemes for this type of equation here @xcite .    nevertheless , we are able to present a special solution of ( [ diff_2 ] ) given by @xmath191 with @xmath192 . going back ,",
    "exact expressions for @xmath122 and @xmath128 are derived , especially @xmath193 .",
    "although these functions do not fulfill the overall condition ( [ diff_1 ] ) for @xmath172 , this heuristic approach yields the correct form of @xmath122 ( see below ) , but an erroneous defect term @xmath128 .",
    "however , we have not exploited the relations between @xmath122 and @xmath128 to the full . according to this ,",
    "we are confronted with three parameters @xmath194,@xmath195 and @xmath167 now , whereas in the previous section only two unknown constants occurred .",
    "to avoid this situation , the second mass moment @xmath196 is used as a third condition .",
    "it has been calculated exactly in @xcite . with a final reassignment @xmath197 the solution @xmath198",
    "is obtained which is in perfect accordance with ( [ mfsol_p ] ) .",
    "so the case @xmath172 differs completely from the case @xmath145 presented in the previous section : it seems to be impossible to derive both , @xmath122 and @xmath128 from the algebraic equation ( [ algebra_c ] ) .",
    "we have to keep in mind that the defect term @xmath128 is merely an auxiliary construct and not part of the final solution ( [ p_d ] ) .",
    "accordingly , there could be some freedom of choice for the defect .",
    "e.g. , a lot of matrix product solutions for stochastic systems are characterized by an a priori choice of the defect terms @xcite .",
    "this simplifies the algebra and leads to the proper solutions . in this way , ( [ ans_sol ] ) represents a suitable choice of the defect function @xmath190 .    in principle",
    ", one could try to solve the algebra for @xmath199 explicitly and propose the general form ( [ mfsol_p ] ) for arbitrary @xmath74 .",
    "but this approach is discontenting . on the one hand",
    ", we do not know about the complexity and resolvability for increasing integer @xmath74 . on the other hand",
    ", we do not provide a method of resolution for not - integer @xmath74 .",
    "finally , we are still lacking of an enclosing mpa calculus that is valid for all @xmath49 densities .",
    "however , the mpa might nevertheless be useful for special araps with non factorizing mass densities .",
    "in this paper we have focused on the asymmetric random average process under parallel dynamics . in the first part ( section [ ch_pms ] )",
    "it has been rigorously proven that only araps equipped with beta densities and @xmath18-densities lead to product measure solutions . here , our calculations have completed a derivation given previously in @xcite . in a second part ( section [ ch_mpa ] )",
    "we have presented an alternative approach , a matrix product ansatz , for deriving the mass densities under use of beta densities . restricted to fraction densities",
    "@xmath142 we have given a complete calculation of the associated mass densities .",
    "for the remaining densities @xmath81 with @xmath184 we have outlined an approach based on differential equations .",
    "altogether , we have extended the scope of the mpa to systems with continuous and unbounded state variables .    however , due to the restriction to araps in class @xmath49 we deal with a one - dimensional representation of the algebraic objects @xmath122 and @xmath128 only . in a next step ,",
    "we should concentrate on araps with non - vanishing correlations which is associated with higher dimensional representations of the algebraic objects .",
    "especially , we believe that the mpa could be the appropriate tool to solve the free arap with @xmath94 under continuous time dynamics . although this process is given by a rather simple fraction density it does not belong to the class of mean - field models @xcite . furthermore , araps with state - dependent fraction densities @xmath46 could be treated with the mpa .",
    "this could bring forward the analysis of truncated processes . on the other hand",
    ", we could ask for @xmath14-functions that lead to solvable algebras , i.e. , solvable functional equations .",
    "in addition , the question arises if the algebraic objects of correlated araps are always representable by matrices , i.e. @xmath200 . or is it even possible to construct araps that are solved by algebraic objects with continuous representations ?",
    "finally , one could identify the class of araps whose stationary states may be written as matrix products",
    ". this would be very similar to @xcite where it has been shown that stochastic processes with a finite number of local states , a finite range of interaction and continuous time dynamics are ( formally ) always solved by mpa .",
    "we like to thank j h snoeijer and j m j van leeuwen for very interesting discussions , especially the reference to the asymmetric representation of the feynman parameters has been very useful . we also like to thank blint tth , jesus garca , pablo ferrari and gunter schtz for helpful discussions .",
    "a schadschneider thanks the daad for support and the institute for mathematics and statistics at the university of sao paulo for its hospitality during the final stages of this work .",
    "we present a proof of the relation @xmath202 the superscript in @xmath203 reminds of the @xmath13 dependence .",
    "the following calculation uses the fourier representation of the @xmath18-function and the relation between ( [ mfsol_p ] ) and ( [ mfsol_q ] ) , i.e. , the principles of laplace transformation : @xmath204 so the r.h.s . of ( [ z_relation ] ) is nothing else than a single site mass density ( [ mfsol_p ] ) for the total mass @xmath205 that is rescaled according to @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "in the backward sequential update one starts updating an arbitrary pair of sites ( @xmath208 ) and applies the local update rules , @xmath209 from right to left , i.e. , opposite to the direction of the mass transport , under consideration of periodicity until reaching the initial pair .",
    "thus , for finite @xmath0 the backward sequential update differs slightly from parallel dynamics because the last pair of sites @xmath210 to be updated holds the site @xmath8 that has been updated already .",
    "however , in the infinite system @xmath211 this `` error '' vanishes because the difference between both update procedures is local and not extensive with @xmath0 . correspondingly the parallel update is equivalent to the backward sequential dynamics in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "putting ( [ mpa_d])([dotp ] ) and ( [ basis_c])([f_def ] ) together we obtain the expression @xmath212 we introduce the linear substitution @xmath213 and @xmath214 that comes along with the trivial jacobian determinant @xmath215 .",
    "therefore , the transformation of ( [ alg_1 ] ) becomes rather simple : @xmath216 here the change of variables generates a structure according to @xmath217 .",
    "since @xmath218 are linearly independent we are able to reduce the condition ( [ mpa_d ] ) to the functional equation ( [ algebra_c ] ) .",
    "the essential component of the calculation is the formula @xmath219 which can be verified easily .    by the help of ( [ formel ] ) it is straightforward to prove ( [ rel_der ] ) by induction . in particular",
    ", the correspondent term of @xmath220 reduces to zero for @xmath221 .",
    "however , for @xmath222 induction finally leads to the case @xmath223 which can not be treated by ( [ formel ] ) because the counterpart of @xmath220 , i.e. , basically @xmath224 at @xmath225 , is divergent here .",
    "therefore , we have restricted to @xmath74 of integer form ."
