    "over 300 exoplanets have been discovered to date with detection rates escalating ( see http://exoplanet.eu by j. schneider ) .",
    "the detections have been so far biased towards large bodies and the smallest transiting planet to date is still neptune - sized , for gliese 436b ( @xcite ) .",
    "current instruments can not yet detect transiting earths but transit time variation ( ttv ) could offer a way to bring sensitivity down to sub earth - mass level ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "given the large number of moons in our own solar system , it is reasonable to postulate that satellites are common around exoplanets .",
    "another profound motivation for looking for exomoons is that they are likely to be terrestrial in nature , based upon our own solar system , and hence one would propose that exomoons could be more habitable environments than the host of extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) so far discovered .",
    "photometric detection of a moon is likely to be exceptionally challenging .",
    "an exomoon is likely to be sub - earth sized , based upon our solar system , and so even a specialized transit space - based telescope like corot will struggle to spot the signature ( @xcite ) .",
    "an additional problem lies in the fact that much of the time the exomoon will not appear to be its orbital distance from the planet , but some fraction of it , depending on the orbital phase of the exomoon during transit .",
    "the moon can effectively hide behind the planet or in front of it .",
    "this makes disentangling the photometric signature exceptionally difficult and was outlined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "previously , several different authors ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) have noted that transit timing variations ( ttv ) could be used to indirectly detect the presence of such exomoons . in the first half of this paper , we update the model for the ttv effect by including orbital eccentricity .",
    "we compare our formulation to the previously proposed mathematical treatment and demonstrate our model reduces to the original analytic equations for zero eccentricity .    however , the crucial problem with ttv is that the amplitude of the signal is proportional to both the exomoon mass , @xmath1 , and orbital separation , @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite referred to this obstacle as the ` inverse problem ' , in regard to transit timing effects . in ",
    "3.1 we show that the exomoon s period can not be reliably determined from ttv and hence @xmath2 remains an unknown .",
    "ergo , one can not establish the mass of the exomoon without assuming a value for the orbital separation .",
    "it is therefore clear that a strong desideratum is a secondary method which can complement ttv and remove this degeneracy and this constitutes the focus of the second part of our paper .    by considering the transit duration ,",
    "we predict a new observable timing effect due to an exomoon , which we label as transit duration variation ( tdv ) .",
    "we find that the amplitude of this timing signal is of the same order of magnitude to the ttv signal and indeed often larger .",
    "the effect is also predicted to be @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the ratio of tdv to ttv allows for the mass of the exomoon to be found without assuming an orbital distance .",
    "in addition , tdv is @xmath4 out - of - phase with ttv , making it an ideal complementary method for exomoon detection .",
    "in the first half of this paper , we aim to update the model for the transit timing variation ( ttv ) signal due a transiting exoplanet with a single satellite of mass @xmath1 and non - zero orbital eccentricity . in this work ,",
    "we consider the variation of the mid - transit point of the _ planetary _ transit , @xmath5 .",
    "this is in contrast to @xcite who consider the planet and moon combined transit . throughout our discussion",
    ", we also make the assumption that planet - moon orbital plane is co - aligned with the planet - star orbital plane at @xmath6 .    in our case ,",
    "the planet orbits the barycentre of the planet - moon system with a semi - major axis of @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes wobble .",
    "the fact that @xmath9 means that the time between the planet being at the mid - transit point and the barycentre being at the mid - transit point is , in general , non - zero , and this is the origin of the ttv effect .",
    "consider the projected distance between the planet and the planet - moon barycentre to be given by @xmath10 , as illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the ttv effect will be given by @xmath10 divided by the @xmath11-direction component of the barycentre s orbital velocity around the star , given by @xmath12 . since @xmath10 is a function of the planet s true anomaly around the planet - moon barycentre , @xmath13 ,",
    "so too is the ttv effect :    @xmath14     and the exomoon is not shown , but the wobble of the planet due its presence is represented by the smaller ellipse .",
    "the origin of the @xmath10-@xmath15 scale denotes the position of the planet - moon barycentre , which itself orbits the star in the @xmath16-@xmath17 scale.__,width=8 ]    in the case of a circular orbit , we expect the ttv signal to have a sinusoidal nature , and infact the peak - to - peak amplitude of the wave may be unambiguously defined as @xmath18 . in the case of eccentric orbits , we expect non - sinusoidal waveforms , due to kepler s equation",
    ". peak - to - peak amplitudes can become ambiguous in such cases , and so we choose to use the root - mean - square ( rms ) amplitude definition , which is valid for all waveforms . for a simple circular orbit",
    ", the rms amplitude of the ttv signal , @xmath19 , will be given by :    @xmath20    where the distance @xmath7 is small enough that we may assume @xmath12 is a constant over the time - scale of the ttv effect .",
    "let us now extend the analysis to include the effect of exomoon orbital eccentricity , @xmath21 and position of pericentre , @xmath22 , as well as planetary eccentricity @xmath23 and position of pericentre , @xmath24 . in appendix",
    "a , we derive the general equation for the rms amplitude of the ttv effect due to an exomoon to be given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2 ( 1+e_p \\sin\\varpi_p)}{(1-e_p^2)}-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 is the semi - major axis of the exoplanet s orbit around the central star , @xmath2 is the semi - major axis of the exomoon s orbit around the exoplanet , @xmath28 is the gravitational constant , @xmath29 is the mass of the host star and @xmath30 i.e. the combined mass of the exomoon and exoplanet respectively is the mass of the planet as measured by radial velocity surveys , and thus includes the mass of satellites ] .    in the case of",
    "@xmath31 we have @xmath32 and similarly for @xmath33 we have @xmath34",
    ". thus we may compare our equation to that derived by previous authors , who assumed circular orbits , and expect to produce the same result .",
    "@xcite predicted the peak - to - peak amplitude of an exomoon around an exoplanet with orbital period @xmath35 to be given by equation ( 6 ) .",
    "@xmath36    using kepler s third law , it is trivial to show that this is equivalent to our expression , for circular orbits and @xmath37 , except for a factor of @xmath38 , which comes from the fact we use an rms definition of amplitude , rather than a peak - to - peak definition .",
    "thus we have confirmed that our general expression for the ttv effect due to an exomoon is equivalent to the circular equations first derived by @xcite . for completion , we note that the ttv amplitude may be written purely in terms of the masses of the three bodies and the period of the exoplanet ( see appendix a , equation ( a28 ) & ( a29 ) ) .",
    "the effect of eccentricity is discussed in more detail in  3.3 and typical waveforms produced are shown later in figure 3 ,  4.2 . in  4.2 , table 1 gives a list of the expected ttv rms amplitudes due to a @xmath39 exomoon around some of the most promising exoplanet candidates .",
    "the orbital radius of any satellite around a planet must lie somewhere between the hill radius , @xmath40 , and the roche limit , @xmath41 , to maintain stability .",
    "we express @xmath2 by assuming that it is equal to some fraction , @xmath42 , of the hill radius , @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath43    where @xmath27 is the semi - major axis of the planet around the host star , @xmath44 is the planetary radius , @xmath42 is some real number between 0 and 1 , and @xmath45 denotes density .",
    "@xmath42 may be further constrained by noting that @xcite estimated @xmath46 and @xcite estimated @xmath47 .",
    "this is because the hill sphere is just an approximation , and in reality other effects , like radiation pressure or the yarkovsky effect , can perturb a body outside of the sphere .",
    "we choose to use the conservative choice of @xmath46 and combining this limit with the roche limit , and rewriting in terms of planetary period , @xmath35 for @xmath48 , we can estimate :    @xmath49    @xcite offer a way of rewriting @xmath50 in terms of just the mass of the exomoon by adopting terrestial models of the internal structure for such bodies .",
    "if we use @xmath51 , then we can estimate @xmath52 .",
    "if we make the approximation that @xmath54 and @xmath55 , and employ kepler s third law , we may provide an estimate for the ratio of the exomoon to planet orbital period , which can be shown ( see appendix b ) to be :    @xmath56    since @xmath57 we will always be in the regime where @xmath58 . taking @xmath59 gives a rough estimate of @xmath60 and so the frequency of the signal is @xmath61 .",
    "however , the nyquist frequency will be given by one half of the sampling rate ( @xmath62 ) , which represents the maximum frequency we can resolve without aliasing .",
    "the usual technique for detecting signals within data is to employ a periodogram , but this method will suffer from aliasing in the exomoon case .",
    "therefore , we can only derive a set of harmonic frequencies which the exomoon s orbit could exhibit .",
    "we therefore conclude @xmath63 can not be reliably determined from the ttv signal .",
    "as originally pointed by @xcite , the major problem with ttv is that one can not determine the mass of the exomoon without making an assumption on the distance at which the moon orbits the planet . using equation ( 3 )",
    ", it is possible to write the ttv amplitude as a function of purely the exomoon properties :    @xmath64    therefore we can effectively only determine the moment of the exomoon . if one knows the period of the exomoon , then it is trivial to derive @xmath2 using kepler s third law , but as seen in  3.1 , @xmath35 can not be reliably ascertained .",
    "this crucial limitation of exomoon ttv makes mass estimation unfeasible and the best we can ever do is merely provide evidence for an exomoon within a large mass range .",
    "this severe limitation will be resolved later in this paper .",
    "the effects of orbital eccentricity on the ttv amplitude are all absorbed into the two parameters , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "if we increase @xmath21 from zero to unity , regardless of what value @xmath22 takes , @xmath67 decreases below 1 and hence the ttv amplitude will always decrease .",
    "this implies exomoon detections are biased towards satellites on circular orbits .",
    "the situation is more complicated for @xmath23 , where a non - zero @xmath23 makes the ttv amplitude significantly increased or decreased depending on @xmath24 . in figure 2 , we plot @xmath68 as a function of @xmath24 for several different eccentricities and find that for @xmath69 , the most favourable position of pericentre is @xmath70 .",
    "however , we point out a recent study by @xcite which predicts such exoplanets to possess a low transit probability .    for the eccentric transiting exoplanets gj436b , xo-3b , hat - p-2b and hd17156b , @xmath68 takes values 1.01 , 1.03 , 0.94 and 0.47 respectively .",
    "however , the stability of satellites around eccentric exoplanets remains unclear .     as a function of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which is effectively the factor by which the ttv is enhanced by for @xmath71 .",
    "positions of pericentre near @xmath72 produce consistently enhanced ttv amplitudes .",
    "the flat line corresponds to @xmath73 and each progressively larger amplitude wave is for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 respectively.__,width=8 ]",
    "transit duration variation ( tdv ) is the periodic change in the duration of a transit ( @xmath77 ) over many measurements , where we define @xmath77 as the time between the 1@xmath78 and 4@xmath79 contact points .",
    "it has previously been discussed as a possible test of general relativity by @xcite . in this discussion",
    ", we consider the tdv due to an exomoon and conclude that it should produce a detectable signal .",
    "we first consider that the duration of a transit is inversely proportional to the projected velocity of the planet across the star , @xmath80 , and make the following assumptions :    * the projected velocity of the planet - moon barycentre during the transit , relative to the star , does not vary significantly over the time - scale of the transit duration .",
    "* the projected velocity of the planet during the transit , relative to planet - moon barycentre , does not vary significantly over the time - scale of the transit duration . *",
    "the orbital inclinations of the planet ( @xmath81 ) and exomoon do not vary from orbit to orbit .",
    "* we do not consider additional perturbing bodies in the system .",
    "@xmath82    in this case , any transit duration variation must be solely due to the variation of the velocity . for a single companion exomoon ,",
    "the velocity of the planet will have two components :    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is the velocity of the planet - moon barycentre around the host star and @xmath85 is the velocity of the planet around the planet - moon barycentre , i.e. the _ wobble _ of the planet due its companion satellite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath86 will be significantly different for each transit unless @xmath87 is some low - order integer .",
    "sometimes @xmath86 will be additive to the barycentre s velocity and sometimes subtractive resulting in shorter and longer transit durations respectively ; an effect we label tdv .",
    "the factor by which @xmath77 will vary must be equal to the ratio of the velocities @xmath88 and from this starting point the tdv amplitude may be shown ( see appendix c2 ) to be equal to :    @xmath89    where @xmath90    in an analogous way to the ttv amplitude , this may be re - written in terms of simply the masses in the system , and this equation may be found in the appendix c2 , equations ( c28 ) and ( c29 ) .",
    "we also point out that this effect has the following proportionality :    @xmath91    as a final note , we point out that in  3.3 we discussed how increasing @xmath21 tends to decrease the ttv amplitude . for the tdv signal ,",
    "the opposite is true , increasing @xmath21 tends to increase the tdv signal .      from equations ( 13 ) and ( 18 ) , it is clear that the ratio of tdv to ttv should be able to eliminate @xmath1 and we can directly measure the orbital seperation of the exomoon @xmath2 and hence @xmath1 .",
    "the introduction of tdv allows for the precise measurement of @xmath1 without any assumption on the orbital separation . using kepler s third law ,",
    "it is then possible to derive the exomoon s orbital period , which was shown in  3.1 to be unattainable from ttv alone . in appendix d",
    ", it is shown that if we assume @xmath92 ( but @xmath23 can take any value between zero and unity ) , then @xmath93 is approximately given by :    @xmath94    therefore one may determine @xmath42 and hence @xmath2 ( and @xmath1 ) if one assumes the exomoon has zero eccentricity .",
    "this assumption is supported based on a study by @xcite and the pattern observed amongst large ( @xmath95 km ) moons in our own solar system .",
    "another major advantage of tdv is that the signal should lag ttv by a @xmath4 phase difference , originating from the fact ttv is a spatial effect whereas tdv is a velocity effect .",
    "unfortunately , the direction and value of the phase shift remains unchanged between prograde and retrograde satellites .",
    "combining ttv and tdv should allow for a much more significant confirmation of a potential exomoon than just using ttv alone .",
    "the phase difference can be seen in the example waveforms in figure 3 , where we plot the ttv and tdv waveforms due to a hypothetical exomoon of @xmath39 around a gj436b for @xmath96 , 0.3 and 0.6 .",

    "4.2)__,width=8 ]    in table 1 , we predict the ttv and tdv rms amplitudes for a variety of known transiting planets .",
    "we include the effects of the known planetary eccentricity , and consider a @xmath39 exomoon with @xmath99 and @xmath96 .",
    "._predicted ttv & tdv rms amplitudes due to a @xmath39 exomoon , for a selection of the best candidate transiting planets .",
    "system parameters are taken from various references , which are shown .",
    "_ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : nonlin ]    in most cases , the tdv amplitude is actually greater than the ttv amplitude .",
    "we do however point out that the error in the transit duration is typically 2 - 3 times that of the mid - transit time ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , the signal should be detectable , especially with future telescopes like kepler .",
    "it is interesting to note that timing errors of just under 1 second could detect a @xmath39 around a @xmath100 exoplanet in the case of xo-3b , a mass ratio of @xmath101 .      consider a hypothetical exoplanet which is identical to gj436b except it has a period of @xmath102 days and is on a circular orbit , putting it into the habitable zone of gj436 with @xmath103k .",
    "although the neptune - like planet itself would not be an ideal place to search for life , an earth mass exomoon would be .",
    "suppose there is a 1@xmath104 exomoon with this planet on a circular orbit and @xmath105 and hence a period of @xmath106 days .",
    "could we detect such a provocative target using timing effects alone ?",
    "the predicted rms ttv amplitude would be 138s and the tdv amplitude would be 60s .",
    "for gj436b , @xcite used the 1.52 m telescopio carlos snchez telescope and achieved a timing accuracy of @xmath107 seconds and a duration error of @xmath108 seconds .",
    "this suggests that the detection of the exomoon should be presently possible through ttv from the ground , and feasible with tdv in the near future .",
    "this illustrates that even ground - based instruments could detect an earth - like body in the habitable zone using timing effects .",
    "we have presented an updated model for the ttv signal due to an exomoon to include the effects of orbital eccentricity in both the exoplanet and the exomoon . from the updated ttv model ,",
    "we draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "ttv is degenerated in that it can only determine @xmath109 , where @xmath1 is the exomoon mass and @xmath2 is the exomoon s orbital radius .",
    "the ttv due to an exomoon can be significantly enhanced for exoplanets of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "however , it remains unclear how dynamically stable such exomoons would be .",
    "the ttv frequency will be always be greater than the sampling frequency of once every transit , implying we can only determine a set of possible harmonic frequencies for the exomoon s period , @xmath63 .    an exomoon is predicted to have another detectable timing effect on a transit in the form of transit duration variation ( tdv ) .",
    "we have derived an equation for predicting the tdv amplitude and drawn the following conclusions :    1 .   the ratio of tdv to ttv allows for the separate determination of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; thus solving the ` inverse problem ' for exomoons .",
    "the tdv signal is of a similar order of magnitude to the ttv signal .",
    "the tdv signal is also enhanced for @xmath71 and @xmath111 .",
    "4 .   tdv lags ttv by a @xmath112 phase difference , making it an excellent complementary technique for exomoon detection .",
    "we also find that current ground - based telescopes could detect a @xmath39 exomoon in the habitable zone around a neptune - like exoplanet",
    ". the author would therefore encourage observers to produce not only their mid - transit times , but also transit durations for each transit , rather than composite lightcurve durations .",
    "this will allow constraints to be placed on the presence of exomoons around such planets .",
