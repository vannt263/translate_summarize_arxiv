    "a powerful toolbox for controlling the dynamics of photonic , plasmonic , and atomic waves is based on the use of periodic potentials , which can be induced by photonic lattices and crystals in optics @xcite , by gratings built into plasmonic waveguides ( see original works plasmon1,plasmon2,plasmon3,plasmon4,plasmon5,plasmon6 , plasmon7,plasmon8,plasmon9,plasmon10,plasmon11,plasmon12 and review plasmon - review ) , and by optical lattices ( ols ) in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite or degenerate fermi gases @xcite . acting in the combination with material nonlinearity ,",
    "periodic potentials give rise to various species of solitons .",
    "these include ordinary ones , existing in the semi - infinite gap ( sig ) of the corresponding linear spectrum , and gap solitons populating finite bandgaps , see reviews @xcite and book peli . extended localized states , in the form of truncated nonlinear bloch waves , which appear in finite bandgaps , have been observed and modeled too @xcite .    on the other hand , a specific species of solitary waves is known in the form of _ embedded solitons _ , which exist , counter - intuitively , inside spectral bloch bands populated by radiation modes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although embedded solitons can not exist , generically , in continuous families , due to the resonance with radiation waves , isolated embedded modes are possible , for which the rate of the decay into radiation vanishes . under more specific conditions , continuous families of embedded solitons were constructed too @xcite .",
    "very recently , the existence of solitons of this type was demonstrated in a model combining the quadratic ( @xmath0 ) nonlinearity and a complex lattice potential , whose imaginary part is subject to the condition of the @xmath1 symmetry , representing symmetrically placed and mutually balanced local gain and loss frederico.while embedded solitons have been studied in some detail in basic one - dimensional ( 1d ) models , it is still an open question to find them in bloch bands of 2d periodic potentials ( stable intra - band solitons were reported in a 2d potential which combines a periodic lattice in one direction and a harmonic - oscillator trap acting perpendicular to the lattice @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the studies of ideal lattices , it has been demonstrated that lattice defects may also be used in optical devices , such as integrated circuits @xcite , microcavities micro , and defect - mode lasers @xcite .",
    "point and line defects help trapping and guiding light flows in structured photonic media pc - defect31-@xcite .",
    "in particular , the bandgap guidance of light by defects in 1d and 2d photonic lattices has been realized in refs .",
    "defect - affected transmission of light was also considered in 2d photonic quasicrystals quasicrystals1,quasicrystals2 .",
    "the dynamics of solitons under the action of defects in discrete nonlinear - schrdinger lattices has been studied too @xcite-@xcite .",

    "a specific manifestation of the transmission of light @xcite-@xcite and matter waves @xcite-@xcite controlled by random sets of defects is the anderson localization in the transverse plane , which does not require nonlinearity .",
    "more recently , a great deal of attention has been drawn by soliton dynamics in nonlinear lattices , i.e. , structures periodically modulating the local nonlinearity @xcite . in this context",
    ", defects can be naturally considered as well . in particular ,",
    "experimental techniques have been developed for the local control of local nonlinearity in bec ( via the feshbach resonance @xcite ) , and in photonic crystals @xcite , which allows one to design desirable nonlinear defects .    in this work",
    "we report numerical analysis of 2d solitons in lattice potentials with local defects , under the action of the self - focusing nonlinearity .",
    "the model is formulated in section ii .",
    "the search for such soliton modes is suggested by previously published results demonstrating the existence of linear defect modes in photonic crystals @xcite-@xcite , including 2d modes @xcite , as well as in ultrasonic crystals @xcite and solid - state lattices ( see refs .",
    "solid - state , solid - state2,solid - state3,solid - state4 and references therein ) , although the solitons that we present below are not actually related to linear defect modes . in section iii , we report numerical results which demonstrate the existence of a new type of embedded solitons , alias _ intra - band _ solitons , _ viz_. , _ continuous _ families of 2d localized modes ( unlike isolated solutions found previously in typical embedded - soliton models ) , which are embedded into the first and second bloch bands of the linear spectrum , in terms of the propagation constant , and pinned to the defect , as concerns the spatial location of the modes .",
    "we name them embedded defect solitons ( edss ) .",
    "it is relevant to stress that , for modes pinned to local lattice defects , it makes sense to identify the location of their propagation constant with respect to the bandgap spectrum of the infinite uniform ol , as the latter determines the spectrum of radiation waves into which the localized mode may decay .    as mentioned above",
    ", the edss _ do not _ emerge from a continuation of linear localized defect modes , as they exist with the norm exceeding a finite minimum value ( and the propagation constant of linear defect modes can not be located inside a bloch band ) . by means of systematic direct simulations ,",
    "the edss are found to be fully stable in the first band and in a part of the second . together with the regular defect solitons populating the sig , and gap defect solitons ( gdss ) nested in the first finite bandgap ( in the spectral slot between the first and second bloch bands ) , which are pinned to the same defect , the intra - band edss form a continuous  superfamily \" threading the entire band structure .",
    "the stability of the gdss supported by the _ self - attractive _ nonlinearity is a remarkable finding , as the previous analysis of gap solitons in defect - free 2d lattices was usually restricted to the case of the self - repulsion , assuming that they would be unstable in the opposite case @xcite ( gap solitons bifurcating under the action of the self - attractive nonlinearity from edges of the adjacent bloch bands into the first finite bandgap were constructed in ref .",
    "@xcite , but their stability was not studied there ; in fact , it was recently found that , while 2d fundamental gap solitons are completely unstable in the first finite bandgap under the self - attractive nonlinearity , a family of _ dipole - mode _ gap solitons are stable in a part of the first bandgap in the same case , provided that the depth of the lattice potential exceeds a certain threshold value @xcite ) .",
    "further , in section iv we demonstrate the existence of stable eds and gds modes with the dipole structure , in the lattice with double and triple local defects , and of vortices supported by quadruple defects .",
    "the paper is concluded by section v.",

    "it is seen that , for given values of the parameters , a growing number of defect - induced isolated eigenvalues appear in the second finite bandgap with the increase in the size of the defect ( single @xmath24 double @xmath24 triple ) , while the first bandgap remains unaffected .",
    "below , we focus not on quite obvious quasi - linear defect modes corresponding to these isolated eigenvalues , but rather on localized states which have _ no linear limit _ , but may be created by the defects in the first finite bandgap , as well as in the two bloch bands adjacent to it . these states were constructed as numerical solutions of eq .",

    "direct simulations demonstrates that the eds family is completely stable in the first bloch band , while the eds becomes unstable in the second band beyond a certain critical point .",
    "it is worthy to note that the stability of the intra - band solitons supported by the defect in the first bloch band agrees with the vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) criterion , which is relevant to localized modes in the case of the self - focusing nonlinearity @xcite , @xmath34 , while the eds branch features @xmath35 in the second band , where the modes are stable in a limited region ( strictly speaking , this may be a region of a very weak instability , which is , nevertheless , tantamount to stability in terms of a possible experiment ) .",

    "[ fig4](c ) initiates the onset of the instability of this soliton . in direct simulations , unstable modes decay into radiation ( not shown here in detail ) .        to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the current model presents the first example of nonlinear localized modes found inside bloch bands of the spectrum induced by the 2d lattice ( in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was dealing with 2d solitons of the embedded type , the lattice was one - dimensional ) .",
    "in fact , the eds family threading the first bloch band plays the role of a missing link between the two well - known types of solitons existing in the lattice potential , _",
    "viz_. , regular ones populating the sig , and gap solitons in the first finite bandgap ( in the present case , they all are pinned to the single defect ) .    as concerns the family of gdss found inside the first finite bandgap , which links the intra - band eds families populating the two adjacent bloch bands ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , our numerical tests have demonstrated that these solitons , being pinned to the defect , are stable only in the case of the self - focusing nonlinearity [ as set in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) ] , on the contrary to gap solitons in perfect lattices , which are usually assumed to be stable solely in the case of the self - defocusing @xcite .",
    "the case of the self - defocusing nonlinearity was explored too , and it was concluded that the pinned gdss are unstable in that case ( not displayed here in detail ) .",
    "the latter finding may be explained by the fact that the effective mass of the gap soliton supported by the self - defocusing nonlinearity is _ negative _ , thus reversing the character of the soliton - defect interaction , and making unstable the bound state of the gap soliton pinned to the attractive defect . in line with this argument",
    ", additional analysis demonstrates that the local defect of the opposite sign , in comparison with the one considered here , gives rise to stable pinned states of gap solitons under the self - defocusing nonlinearity , and unstable states in the case of the self - focusing .",
    "the negative mass of gap solitons explains a number of other counter - intuitive dynamical effects featured by these modes @xcite-@xcite .",
    "numerical results also demonstrate that the self - defocusing nonlinearity _ does not _ give rise to solitons that would be embedded into bloch bands and pinned to the defect .    a typical example of the stable pinned gds , found in the first finite bandgap in the case of the self - focusing nonlinearity , which corresponds to point d in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . finally , our numerical simulations suggest that stable gdss pinned to the defect do not exist in the relatively narrow second finite bandgap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , in agreement with the general trend of gap solitons to be unstable in the second bandgap @xcite .    ) under the self - focusing nonlinearity . ]",
    "we have extended the above analysis for the double , triple , and quadruple lattice defects , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b , c , d ) .",
    "while the solitary defect may only support fundamental solitons of both the eds and gds types , as shown above , the double defects readily give rise to stable dipole - mode bound states of two solitons with opposite signs .",
    "examples of such modes , found in the first bloch band and in the first finite bandgap ( i.e. , of the eds and gds types , respectively ) , are shown in fig .",

    "further , the quadruple defects [ see fig . [ fig1](d ) ] create stable solitary vortices , characteristic examples of which are shown in fig .",
    "as is typical for vortices supported by lattice potentials vortex , vortex2,nl_oursb , review - multid , they are built as rhombic sets of four intensity peaks , with a nearly empty site in the center ( therefore this type of vortices is often called onsite - centered ) , and phase shifts @xmath40 between the peaks , which corresponds to the global phase circulation of @xmath41 ( i.e. , topological charge @xmath42 ) . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , direct simulations demonstrate that the pinned vortices are unstable in the second bloch band , being stable elsewhere .    , supported by the quadruple defect inside the first bloch band ( top , @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , and in the first bandgap ( bottom , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "the contour plots show the phase distribution in the vortices . ]     for the vortices with topological charge @xmath42 , pinned to the quadrupole lattice defect .",
    "the solid and dashed curves show stable and unstable solutions , respectively . ]",
    "in this work , we have studied localized states which can be supported by single , double , triple , and quadruple defects of 2d lattice potentials in the self - focusing medium .",
    "the model describes lattices in nonlinear photonic media and bec trapped in the ol .",
    "the first result is that the single defect supports families of intra - band ( _ embedded _ ) solitons , in the first and second bloch bands .",
    "these modes exist above the minimum value of the norm , i.e. , they do not emerge from any linear defect mode .",
    "direct simulations demonstrate stability of the family in the first bloch band , and in a part of the second band . the branch of the stable pinned solitons embedded into the first band links families of regular and gap solitons hosted by the semi - infinite and first finite bandgaps , respectively , and pinned to the same defect .",
    "the family of the gap solitons , pinned to the defect , is stable , despite the fact that the nonlinearity is self - attractive , while it is usually assumed that 2d fundamental gap solitons may be stable only under the self - repulsion ( in uniform lattices ) .",
    "finally , it has been found that the double and triple defects support stable dipole solitons , in the first bloch band and in the first finite bandgap alike , and , similarly , the quadruple defect creates stable vortex solitons .",
    "this work can be naturally extended in other directions  in particular , to the model with a rectilinear defect , as an elongated version of the double one .",
    "search for stable vortex solitons with higher topological charges , and , possibly ,  supervortices \" ( vortex rings built of compact localized vortices ) @xcite may be relevant too .",
    "on the other hand , it may be interesting to consider defects in complex lattices , whose imaginary part is subject to the condition of the @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "2d gap solitons in uniform @xmath1-symmetric lattices were found recently , but they are unstable @xcite .",
    "stable 1d solitons pinned to defects in @xmath1-symmetric lattices , embedded into the medium with the self - defocusing cubic nonlinearity , were reported very recently in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this connection , it is also relevant to mention that 1d and 2d gap solitons can be readily made stable in a more general ginzburg - landau system , which does not impose the balance condition on the gain and dissipation @xcite .",
