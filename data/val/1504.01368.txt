    "the rapid growth of online social networks ( osns ) , such as twitter or facebook , led to over two billion accounts being active in 2014  @xcite , connecting over one quarter of the world s population and @xmath0 of online u.s .",
    "adults  @xcite . bridging",
    "the gap between social sciences , and information and communication technologies , osns constitute a crucial building block in the development of innovative approaches to the challenges society faces today .",
    "however , technological progress over the last decade has dramatically outpaced our understanding of the new systems and their impact on society .",
    "this lack of understanding of the complex dynamics of the digital world reveals the pressing need for a comprehensive and concise theory to describe and model the online world as a set of interacting networks . in this context , the activity of users has become a resource to be fought over and which drives competition in the digital world .",
    "digital services only persist if they can attract and maintain users attention . here",
    ", we describe the online world as a complex , digital ecosystem in which interacting networks constitute species in competition for survival . within this ecological context",
    ", the extinction of a network corresponds to the complete absence of activity , as an entirely passive network can not function and , more importantly , will not attract new users .",
    "in a recent study  @xcite , we demonstrated that a moderate number of identical networks can coexist in the digital ecosystem , in contrast to the principle of competitive exclusion  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that previous work , in this paper we address the heterogeneity of networks .",
    "networks can differ in functionality , features , and most importantly they can address different peer groups . here , we show how the effect of different overlapping peer groups can be described in terms of different degrees of network fitness .",
    "we find that under certain conditions , the heterogeneity of degrees of fitness can impede coexistence which would indeed be possible for identical networks .",
    "this effect is particularly important for the competition between local networks and an international network .",
    "unlike users of local networks , users of the international network have the possibility to interact with people in other countries , providing this network an advantage over local ones , similar to a higher fitness of a certain species .",
    "a proper modeling of this effect requires taking into account the network of interactions among countries in the world , which results in a highly complex and non - linear dynamical system made of interconnected multilayer networked entities ",
    "we are hence dealing with networks of multiplex networks  @xcite , in contrast to ref .  @xcite .",
    "besides , inter - country interactions induce a different type of bifurcation as the symmetry of the previous model is broken , which constitutes a fundamentally new behavior not observed in  @xcite .",
    "empirical observations have shown that facebook expanded massively in the middle of the first decade of this century , starting in the us , when local networks were the most popular services in most countries .",
    "only a few years later , facebook had become the most popular network in most countries .",
    "so , is the fate of the digital world to become dominated by a single `` big brother '' as it takes over all our digital interactions ?",
    "alternatively , is digital diversity possible from a system - level perspective ? in this paper , we show that due to the nonlinear character of our model , the answer to both questions can be positive or negative depending on a range of parameters and , quite surprisingly , depending on chance .",
    "as we will show , our model , despite its simplicity and the limited number of parameters , is able to describe surprisingly well the complex behavior of globally interacting online social networks .",
    "the digital world consists of highly connected and strongly coupled interacting subsystems .",
    "these basic building blocks are single networks , each of which obeys specific dynamics in the absence of coupling to the whole system .",
    "so the complexity of the digital world is a consequence of both the dynamics of networks in isolated environments and the interactions between many such networks .",
    "finally , not all of these building blocks are identical . instead",
    ", different networks address different peer groups or have different functionalities .",
    "hence , to reveal the fundamental mechanisms that determine the fate of the digital world , it is necessary to understand the interaction of heterogeneous networks , each driven by intrinsic dynamics .",
    "the key actors in the digital world are osns ; loosely defined as web - based platforms that enable digital social interactions over the internet .",
    "however , societies were organized as networks long before osns were even thought of . from this point of view , the growth of osns can be described through the dynamical processes by which people in the traditional offline social structure come to engage in osns .",
    "the topology of the osn is now the digital counterpart of the underlying offline social network  @xcite .    in isolation",
    ", this process of formation can be described by a set of simple dynamical mechanisms  @xcite .",
    "the system is initially given by an empty osn and the underlying social structure .",
    "individuals can be in three different states : active , passive or susceptible . while active and passive nodes exist in the online as well as the offline networks , susceptible nodes are only present in the latter .",
    "a susceptible node can join the osn via two different mechanisms : a _ viral activation _ effect which means that a susceptible node becomes active due to the influence of an active neighbor in the offline network and a _ mass media _ effect , which represents the spontaneous activation of a susceptible node .",
    "in addition , an active node can become passive spontaneously ( _ deactivation _ ) and a passive node can become active again due to the influence of an active neighbor ( _ viral reactivation _ ) .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig_panel1]d for a visualization of these mechanisms .",
    "notice that , in the long time limit , when the number of susceptible individuals is basically zero , this dynamics is equivalent to the susceptible - infected - susceptible model widely used in epidemiology  @xcite . as found in@xcite , this implies that online social networks can either exhibit a sustained activity ( similar to the endemic phase ) , or they can become entirely passive ( similar to the healthy phase ) .",
    "the evolution of osns rarely takes place in isolation .",
    "nevertheless , we found a perfect case study in the slovakian social network `` pokec '' , which , due to the particularities of the country , has been growing in quasi - isolation for more than ten years . by analyzing the evolution of the topology of the social contact graph of `` pokec ''",
    ", we were able to rigorously validate our model .",
    "quite remarkably , with only two parameters , the model reproduced the entire topological evolution with astonishing precision .",
    "_ viral activation",
    "_ and _ viral reactivation _",
    "occur at the same rate , @xmath1 , and the ratio between this rate and the rate of _ mass media _ influence , @xmath2 , governs the topological evolution .",
    "in particular , we observed that the real system underwent a dynamical percolation transition ; that is , a phase transition between a disconnected phase and a phase in which a macroscopic fraction of the system is connected .",
    "the position of this transition is controlled by @xmath3 , due to the complementary roles that the _ viral activation _ and _ mass media _ effects play in the topological evolution of the network ( the former tends to connect components ; whereas the latter tends to create new components ) .",
    "finally , without loss of generality , we set the _ deactivation _",
    "rate @xmath4 to @xmath5 which is equivalent of fixing the timescale of the model .    to sum up , in our previous work  @xcite",
    ", we were able to rigorously validate the dynamics ruling osns in isolation ; the fundamental building blocks of the digital world .",
    "these findings constitute the foundation for the development of a more comprehensive theory of interacting heterogeneous networks .",
    "the simultaneous existence of multiple digital services in competition for the attention of users suggests an ecological perspective from which to explain the prevalence of a given network or the coexistence of multiple networks . in ecology theory ,",
    "the principle of competitive exclusion  @xcite states that multiple species in competition for the same resource can not coexist , as even the slightest advantage of one species over the other is successively amplified ; a mechanism referred to as `` rich get richer '' or preferential attachment  @xcite .",
    "this eventually leads to the extinction of the inferior species .",
    "the key principle that drives the competition between osns is the fact that , due to the physical and cognitive limitations of users , the time they devote to online activities is limited . as a consequence , the viral parameter , @xmath1 , constitutes a conserved quantity that is nevertheless distributed between the competing networks as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents a normalized set of weights , that is @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a vector denoting the fraction of active nodes ( activities ) in the different networks . in general",
    ", users are more likely to subscribe to and engage in networks that are more active .",
    "therefore , the viral activity of each network must be a function of the activity of the network itself .",
    "in particular , we model this by assuming that the weighting @xmath7 is a function , such that @xmath10 . in  @xcite we proposed the particular form : @xmath11^\\sigma}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n_l } \\left",
    "[ \\rho_j^\\mathrm{a } \\right]^\\sigma } { \\,,}\\label{eq_weights}\\ ] ] were @xmath12 denotes the number of networks .",
    "this choice allows us to interpolate between a set of independent networks ( @xmath13 ) and highly coupled ones ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the activity affinity parameter , @xmath15 , then quantifies the tendency of users to subscribe to or engage in more active networks .",
    "interestingly , in contrast to the principle of competitive exclusion , multiple networks can coexist because the `` rich get richer '' mechanism is damped by the diminishing returns of the dynamics of network evolution . for details",
    ", we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following ,",
    "we take into account the heterogeneity of networks induced by different groups of individuals that can subscribe to the different networks .",
    "these aspects are not discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite and have important implications and applications , as we will show .",
    "as mentioned above , since its official launch in 2004 , facebook has become the most popular osn in most countries ; even in countries where there was already a popular osn before facebook was launched . to mimic the real evolution of the digital ecosystem at the worldwide scale",
    ", we assume that one local network exists in each country in addition to a globally operating , international network ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_panel1]a ) . in the us ,",
    "both networks are launched at the same time ; whereas the international network is launched with a delay @xmath16 in the remaining countries , to take into account the initial prevalence of local networks",
    ".    once launched , the international network provides the user with the possibility to connect to individuals in different countries , in contrast to local networks , making it more attractive to users . for a given country , the advantage of the international network is directly related to the abundance of social ties between that country and the rest of the world .",
    "we use passenger air travel data as a proxy for the abundance of such ties .",
    "this choice is justified by the strong correlation between air travel flows and further measures of inter - country exchange , for instance email communication  @xcite or twitter activity  @xcite .",
    "users in country @xmath17 experience the greater attractiveness of the international network as they perceive its activity with respect to the population of their own country and also with respect to their contacts in other countries . to account for this on a coarse grained level , in eq .",
    ", we replace the activity of the international network by an effective activity as follows    @xmath18    where @xmath19 }          \\label{eqn_def_omega}\\ ] ] denotes the fraction of the number of air travel passengers between countries @xmath17 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 ; and @xmath22 , the population of country @xmath17 . notice that , in an ecological context , this corresponds to increased fitness of the international network . in eq .  , we have implicitly assumed proportionality between the number of passengers and the number of contacts in the respective countries , namely @xmath23 .",
    "finally , note that the arbitrary normalization in eq .   serves the sole purpose of ensuring that reasonable values for the parameter @xmath24 are of the order of unity .",
    "hereafter , we decompose the international network into a set of disjunct coupled subnetworks operating in each country and in competition with the respective local network ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_panel1]b ) .",
    "these subnetworks are nevertheless not independent , as they are globally coupled via the effective activity defined in eq .",
    "and ultimately by the network representing the inter - country social ties . hence , our model forms a network of networks  @xcite , where each node in fig .",
    "[ fig_panel1]c represents a three - layer multiplex network  @xcite in which the bottom layer corresponds to the underlying social structure and the two upper layers denote the local and international networks operating in the respective country ( see fig .  [",
    "fig_panel1]d ) .          to understand the qualitative behavior of the system , in this section we present a double meanfield approximation of the system .",
    "this reduces the system given by a network of networks to a set of evolution equations of the average activity in the international network and in local networks .",
    "as we show in the following section , the results of the full model with heterogeneous topologies exhibits similar behavior to that encountered by the double meanfield approximation .",
    "the first meanfield approximation consists of assuming a fully mixed homogeneous population in each country .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the fraction of active users in network @xmath26 in country @xmath17 and @xmath27 the fraction of nodes susceptible to joining this network .",
    "then , the fraction of passive users is given by @xmath28 .",

    "[ fig_bif ] ) .",

    "( see the columns of fig .",
    "[ fig_bif ] ) .",
    "this is particularly interesting as it implies that an intermediate value of the activity affinity just slightly above the critical point @xmath48 represents the worst scenario for the survival of local networks , since at this point the size of the basin of attraction of the domination of the international network is maximum .    .",

    "understanding the complex dynamics of the digital world constitutes an important challenge for interdisciplinary science . to meet this challenge , here we describe the the worldwide web as a complex , digital ecosystem in which interacting networks play the role of species in competition for survival .",
    "in particular , we study the competition between local networks operating in single countries and an international network that operates in all countries .",
    "therefore , a proper description of this system must necessarily involve the network of worldwide social interactions between different countries .",
    "we show that the effect of inter - country social ties can be mapped to the increased fitness of the international network by means of an effective activity .",
    "interestingly , there is a critical global coupling strength below which networks can coexist .",
    "however , above that threshold , only domination is possible : in general , local networks become extinct with a high probability .",
    "yet , we find that if local networks are launched earlier they can persist and dominate the international network , which happens only if local networks have accumulated a sufficiently large active userbase when the global launch of the international network takes place .",
    "the accumulation of a sufficient base depends on the parameters ; and for certain parameters on chance . for these parameters the final state of the system whether local networks dominate or become extinct can be completely unpredictable , as it varies randomly between different realizations of the model .",
    "quite remarkably , a thorough comparison of our model with empirical data from the recent takeover of facebook indicates that the most probable launch date of facebook was at the beginning of @xmath83 and its global launch was in late @xmath85 .",
    "facebook was in fact started in @xmath86 , but opened to the public in @xmath83 ; in good agreement with the estimate from our model .",
    "moreover , according to google trend data ( see supplementary materials ) , @xmath85 was the year when the global search volume for facebook started to increase rapidly .",
    "last but not least , our best estimation of the model parameters corresponds to the `` coinflip '' region , which means that the observed takeover of facebook only had a probability of around @xmath80 . with a @xmath87 probability , we would have been living in a world where each country had its own successful local network and a network like facebook would not exist  @xcite .",
    "our findings suggest interesting future lines of research . on the one hand , even without adjusting the parameters on a country - by - country level , our model reproduces the main features empirically observed in the takeover of facebook and the extinction of local networks in most countries for a certain parameter region .",
    "it remains an interesting task for future research to further increase the precision of the model .",
    "this could be done by improving the proxy for the similarity between countries or by adjusting parameters on a country - by - country basis . on the other hand ,",
    "the model could be extended to account for several international networks and to study their global competition . for a second international network to overcome the first , a certain minimal difference of fitness is needed ; which could be the result of different properties of the networks , such as features or functionalities .",
    "finally , random fluctuations of fitness could be incorporated to describe darwinian selection in the digital ecosystem .",
    "we use the @xmath88 model  @xcite to generate the synthetic networks for the underlying societies in each country .",
    "the model allows us to specify the degree distribution and the level of clustering .",
    "the model is based on a circle as a hidden metric space and works as follows :    1 .",
    "all nodes are placed on the circle with a randomly assigned variable , @xmath89 , which represents the polar coordinate .",
    "@xmath89 is uniformly distributed in @xmath90 . to keep the average node density on the circle constant",
    ", its radius grows linearly with the number of nodes , to satisfy @xmath91 .",
    "we assign each node a second hidden variable , @xmath92 , which represents its expected degree .",
    "@xmath92 is drawn from an arbitrary distribution @xmath93 .",
    "a pair of nodes is connected with a probability , @xmath94 , that depends on their hidden variables @xmath95 and @xmath96 : @xmath97 with @xmath98 . here",
    ", @xmath99 denotes the geodesic distance between the two nodes on the circle and @xmath100 the mean degree .",
    "then , the expected degree , @xmath101 , of a node with hidden variable @xmath92 can be shown to be proportional to @xmath92  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the degree distribution , @xmath102 , of the network follows the shape of the distribution @xmath93 .      here , we use an exponential distribution @xmath103 with @xmath104 .",
    "we set the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 . after generating the networks , we remove nodes with zero degree .",
    "[ fig_s1_properties ] shows the degree distribution and the clustering spectrum for the synthetic network created for the us .",

    "the network on a country basis incorporates 230 nodes and 4600 weighted edges which correspond to the number of routes between countries , i.e. the number of total flights .",
