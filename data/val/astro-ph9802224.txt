    "according to their observable properties , elliptical galaxies can be divided into two classes .",
    "this dichotomy is most clearly revealed in the central brightness distribution ( cf .",
    "fig .  3 of gebhardt  1996 ) .",
    "consequently , the two classes are commonly called ` power - law galaxies ' and ` core galaxies ' ( though  as so often in astronomy ",
    "the latter term is highly misleading : these galaxies actually do not have a core of constant density ) .",
    "core galaxies have shallow central luminosity density profiles with @xmath0 , @xmath1 , ellipticities e0 to e3 - 4 , elliptic to boxy isophotes , and negligible rotation @xmath2 .",
    "they are on average bright ( @xmath3 ) and often radio - loud and x - ray - active , possess extended stellar envelopes and rich ( @xmath4 ) , extended globular cluster ( gc ) systems which are multi - modal in their properties .",
    "these galaxies are thought to be of round to triaxial shape supported by anisotropy in the stellar motions .",
    "power - law galaxies , on the other hand , have steep central density cusps with @xmath5 , ellipticities up to e7 , elliptic to disky isophotes , and significant rotation velocities @xmath6 .",
    "they are on average fainter ( @xmath7 ) and show no radio or x - ray activity ; their surface density follows a de vaucouleurs profile and their gc systems are poor ( @xmath8 ) and with a profile following that of the stellar light .",
    "these galaxies are believed to be of near - oblate shape supported by rotational motions .    clearly , m87 having a shallow density cusp ( @xmath9 ) , round isophotes , neglible rotation , radio and x - ray activity , an extended stellar envelope , and a rich and bi - modal globular cluster system is a generic representative of the class of core galaxies .",
    "it is generally believed , that the core galaxies are formed by one or more major merger events . in face of this hypothesis ,",
    "it is important to ask whether m87 is consistent with being a merger remnant .",
    "the presence of dark matter around spiral galaxies was established by studies of the motions of their gaseous disk , whose emission lines can be traced to large radii .",
    "elliptical galaxies in general have very little cold gas and one has traditionally used stars as dynamical tracer population .",
    "however , at large radii the stellar absorption - line spectra are very hard , if not impossible , to observe with useful signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "thus , in order to probe the potential at large radii of elliptical galaxies , one needs different kinematical tracers .",
    "possible candidates are gas rings , planetary nebul  ( pn ) , and globular clusters ( gc ) .",
    "gas rings are rather rare among elliptical galaxies , and in general one is left with pns or gcs .",
    "the problem with using these or stars as tracers is that they do not move on circular orbits like the gas , but form dynamically hot systems , which complicates the interpretation of the measured kinematics .",
    "recently , cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) have studied the gc system of m87 .",
    "the derived rotation velocity @xmath10 and velocity dispersion @xmath11 are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - sigma ] together with stellar kinematical data for the central parts .",
    "there is a clear change in the kinematic properties at about 100  from the centre : in the inner parts @xmath12 and @xmath11 decreases from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ; in the outer parts @xmath11 increases reaching @xmath13 at 400   and @xmath10 becomes significant .",
    "this kinematical behaviour is very similar to that observed for ngc 1399 ( cd galaxy in the fornax cluster ) by arnaboldi & freeman ( 1996 ) using pns as tracers ( their fig .",
    "[ fig - mass ] ) .",
    "an obvious explanation is that the change in kinematical properties constitutes the transition from the highly concentrated galaxy to the less concentrated and dark - matter - dominated virgo cluster .",
    "cohen & ryzhov have analysed their data in terms of the mass distribution and found that in the range @xmath15 ( using a distance to m87 of 15mpc ) their data imply a mass density @xmath16 and a mass of @xmath17 inside 44 .",
    "these findings are in agreement with estimates derived from x - ray observations ( @xcite ) , see fig .",
    "it is intriguing that the derived density slope of @xmath18 agrees well with @xmath19 recently predicted for the inner parts of dark matter halos by high - resolution simulations of cdm cosmogonies ( @xcite ) .",
    "because of its stellar kinematics , m87 has for a long time been suspected to harbour at its centre a super - massive black hole ( ) , though this conclusion was always controversial ( cf .  ) .",
    "the best currently available photometry ( @xcite ) and stellar kinematical data ( @xcite ) show a weak density cusp and a slightly centrally peaked velocity dispersion @xmath11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - sigma ] ) .",
    "as van der marel s analysis showed , these data can easily be interpreted by a pure stellar model with constant mass - to - light ratio and anisotropy ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the tangential and radial velocity dispersions . for an isotropic system @xmath22 ; for radial anisotropy @xmath23 reaching @xmath24 for pure radial orbits ; and for tangential anisotropy @xmath25 with @xmath26 for pure circular orbits .",
    "] of @xmath27 ( @xcite ) , i.e.  radially anisotropic as expected for a galaxy formed by violent relaxation .",
    "alternatively , one can explain the centrally peaked @xmath11 by a central  of a few billion solar masses .",
    "however , such a model does not work with radial anisotropy near the , which would give too high a central @xmath11 , and requires the opposite : isotropy or tangential anisotropy , depending on the mass of the .",
    "bender  ( 1994 ) found a change in the profile of the stellar absorption lines : the coefficient @xmath28 of the gauss - hermite expansion of the profile changes sign at @xmath29 , such that @xmath30 inside and @xmath31 outside .",
    "this implies a change in the underlying dynamical properties in the sense that @xmath32 , as predicted by models with central  ( though it would be very hard to quantify this ) .    actually , since 1994 we _ know _ from hst observations of a central gas - disk that m87 hosts a central  of @xmath33 ( @xcite and this volume ) .",
    "starting from this fact and assuming spherical symmetry and a constant stellar mass - to - light ratio , merritt & oh ( 1997 ) solved simultaneously the projection equation for the stellar kinematics and the jeans equation describing dynamical equilibrium .",
    "this gave them a non - parametric estimate for the anisotropy implied by the observed stellar kinematics and the .",
    "their results for a  of 1 , 2.4 , and 3.8 billion solar masses are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig - oh ] . for a sufficiently massive",
    ", the central stellar motions are strongly tangentially anisotropic ( @xmath34 ) . the more massive the , the stronger the inferred anisotropy and the larger is the radius at which @xmath35 changes sign . outside of this radius ,",
    "the stellar motions are slightly radially anisotropic in agreement with van der marel s ( 1994 ) study . for the most recent estimate of @xmath36 ,",
    "the effect is very significant leading to highly tangential anisotropy . in the following section ,",
    "i discuss possible explanations for this effect .",
    "can we understand the abrupt change in the stellar motions from radial to tangential anisotropy near the ?",
    "let us consider various possible scenarios for the formation of the  at the centre of a galaxy .",
    "* adiabatic growth of the black hole *    if the  grows slowly over a long period of time , the actions of the stellar orbits are conserved",
    ". however , the mapping between actions and ordinary phase - space coordinates changes as the potential evolves from harmonic ( for an initially isothermal core ) to keplerian .",
    "this change results in a stellar density cusp with @xmath37 and a mildly tangential anisotropy of at most @xmath38 ( @xcite ) inside the sphere of influence of the , which has radius @xmath39 while this radius is of the correct size , the effect is much too weak in order to explain merritt & oh s result of @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , m87 has a central density slope @xmath40 .",
    "* growth by the capture of stars *    a  may grow by tidally disrupting and capturing stars that happen to come too close to it .",
    "such stars will predominantly have low angular momenta , while near - circular orbits are hardly affected .",
    "hence , this process gives rise to @xmath25 .",
    "however , the distance from the  that a star must reach before it gets destroyed is of the order of the s schwarzschild radius , which is smaller than @xmath41 by several orders of magnitude .",
    "* growth by the accretion of black holes *    if two galaxies , each hosting a massive  at its centre , merge , the s will sink to the centre of the remnant and finally merge as well ( @xcite ) .",
    "begelman  ( 1980 ) have outlined the stages of this process :    * due to dynamical friction with the background stars , the s sink into the centre and form a  binary . * the binary looses energy and angular momentum ( it `` hardens '' ) due to three - body interactions with passing stars .",
    "* when the separation between the s has become sufficiently small , gravitational radiation becomes very efficient in hardening the binary until it finally merges to a single .",
    "depending on the time - scale of the whole process , repeated events of this kind are possible , in particular for a central - cluster elliptical , such as m87 , which over its lifetime has likely cannabalised many minor companions .",
    "the least understood mechanism here is ( 2 ) , which is also the process most relevant to the possible effect on the stellar dynamics .",
    "one problem , for instance , is whether or not the eccentricity of the binary  increases , which in turn is relevant for ( 3 ) , since for a highly eccentric binary gravitational radiation can take over at higher energies , i.e.  earlier , than for a less eccentric binary .",
    "another problem is loss - cone depletion : three - body interactions that harden the binary eject stars out of the centre , and the number of interaction candidates diminishes .",
    "eventually , this may even halt the hardening before gravitational radiation can take over ( the re - fueling of the loss cone due to two - body relaxation is much too slow ) .",
    "it is clear that process ( 2 ) will create tangential anisotropy , since , as for the tidal disruption , low - angular - momentum stars are more likely to interact with the s  they are , however , not eaten by the  but ejected via a sling - shot .",
    "evidently , this process reaches out to the radius @xmath41 , where the circular motion around the s equals the mean stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "recently , quinlan ( 1996 ) and quinlan & hernquist ( 1997 ) have studied processes ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) by detailed simulations .",
    "they developed an @xmath42-body code in which the -  interaction is computed exactly ( newtonianly ; relativistic effects are unimportant before stage 3 ) , the -star interactions by a softened keplerian force , and the star - star interactions via an expansion of the stellar potential in basis functions , i.e.  essentially collisionless .",
    "their code thus follows the dynamical evolution of the s and stars in a self - consistent way . in their simulations ,",
    "quinlan & hernquist started with the stars being in spherical isotropic equilibrium following a jaffe model ( which has @xmath43 ) and various choices for the masses and initial positions of the s. their general conclusions relevant here are as follows .",
    "( i ) the total mass of the stars ejected from the centre by three - body interactions is about twice the mass of the  binary .",
    "( ii ) wandering of the  pair significantly increases the loss cone and mitigates the problem of its depletion .",
    "( iii ) inside about @xmath41 , the density profile has become much shallower , almost flat , the velocity dispersion increases in a keplerian fashion , and the stellar motions are significantly tangentially anisotropic with @xmath44 ( see fig .  [ quinlan_hernquist ] ) .",
    "thus , at least qualitatively , this process can explain the presence of a shallow stellar cusp with significant tangential anisotropy around a central black hole .",
    "however , there are some points where m87 does not fit smoothly into this picture . for example",
    ", the radius inside which the density of m87 becomes shallow ( @xmath45 ) is clearly larger than the radius inside which @xmath25 ( @xmath46 ) , while the simulations indicate that these radii should be similar .",
    "also , the central cusp of m87 is not completely dug out as in quinlan & hernquist s simulations .",
    "these discrepancies indicate that reality is more complicated , possibly involving several such accretion events with `` small '' secondary s and/or dissipational processes ( e.g.star formation ) as indicated by the presence of the central gas - disk .",
    "the processes discussed in the last section influence the structure and dynamics of the stellar system only in the immediate neighbourhood of the , i.e.  inside @xmath41 .",
    "a central , however , will influence all those stars that ever come near the centre .",
    "many stars in triaxial galaxies are on box orbits , which pass arbitrarily close to the centre after a sufficiently long time .",
    "it was argued by gerhard & binney ( 1985 ) that scattering and re - distribution of box orbits by a central  would cause at least the inner parts of a triaxial galaxy to become rounder or more axisymmetric .    using a modification of the @xmath42-body code employed by quinlan & hernquist , merritt & quinlan ( 1998 )",
    "have recently studied this process numerically .",
    "they created a stable triaxial equilibrium model by the simulated collapse of a non - equilibrium configuration , and followed the time - evolution of this model when at its centre a point mass was slowly grown .",
    "[ merritt ] shows , for three different  masses , the time - evolution of the shape of the model . in all simulations , the galaxy model tends to become axisymmetric , even at the half mass radius . for the lightest  with @xmath47 (",
    "@xmath48 denotes the mass of the galaxy ) , this process is still ongoing at the end of the simulation , whereas for @xmath49 it is nearly finished .",
    "the most interesting result , however , is that for @xmath50 the process is almost finished at the time @xmath51 when the  has reached its final mass .",
    "further simulation of the authors with varying @xmath51 confirmed this result : for @xmath52 the shape becomes axisymmetric as soon as possible , i.e.  at @xmath53 , where @xmath54 denotes the dynamical or crossing time at radius @xmath55 .",
    "this behaviour can be explained by the  inducing chaos in the orbital motions of the triaxial galaxy . for small @xmath56 ,",
    "the orbits become weakly chaotic , i.e.  they behave like a box orbit over some time , but after a sufficiently long time they fill their energy surfaces . for ever larger @xmath57 ,",
    "the orbits become ever more strongly chaotic until at some critical @xmath56 the liapunov time ( the time in which two neighbouring trajectories diverge ) equals the dynamical time , i.e.  the orbits no longer resemble box orbits at all . in the simulations of merritt & quinlan this critical @xmath56 is about 2.5% of @xmath48 . in general , this number should depend on details of the triaxial configuration , but is likely to be of the same order , i.e.  @xmath58 .    from the existence of this critical @xmath56 , merritt & quinlan draw a very interesting conclusion . in order for s to grow by gas accretion ( the standard model for agns )",
    ", the gas has to reach the  from large radii , i.e.it has to lose its angular momentum . in axisymmetric galaxies ,",
    "the conservation of angular momentum along ballistic orbits renders gas - fueling of the centre very difficult .",
    "thus , a  may cut off its own gas supply by changing the shape of its host galaxy .",
    "if this picture actually applies , the  mass should be no larger than the critical @xmath59 .",
    "a correlation in this sense is indeed observed : @xmath56 inferred from the dynamics of several early - type galaxies is always of this order ( cf.kormendy & richstone 1995 ) . in m87 , @xmath60 is only @xmath61 , which might be a consequence of mergers that convert disks into spheroids and hence increasing @xmath48 ( merritt , private communications ) .",
    "several s , however , are hosted by barred spiral galaxies ( e.g.  the galaxy , ngc 1068 ) .",
    "tumbling bars are mainly made of stars on so - called @xmath62 orbits , which avoid the very centre .",
    "hence , the mechanism working on box orbits for triaxial bulges may not ( or not as well ) work for barred spirals .",
    "the kinematics of m87 are well studied , which make this galaxy a good test case for the theories of galaxy formation . outside",
    "@xmath63 , the velocity dispersion profile rises indicating the presence of large amounts of non - luminous matter . the inferred density profile @xmath16 is consistent with predictions from cdm cosmogony for the inner parts of dark - matter halos .",
    "the massive black hole ( ) , detected in the very centre of m87 by gas motions , together with the observed stellar kinematics implies a significant tangential anisotropy of the stellar motions . among the formation histories discussed for a  in a galactic centre , only the model of accretion of other massive s , originating from the centres of cannabalized companions ,",
    "can explain such a strong anisotropy .",
    "this scenario also predicts a shallow stellar density cusp as observed for m87 .",
    "( quantitatively , there are some discrepancies , which may well be due to over - simplification in the simulations of this process . )    a massive  at the centre of a triaxial galaxy renders , by the destruction of box orbits , the shape of its host axisymmetric .",
    "this mechanism becomes very fast once the  mass reaches a critical value , which is of the order of 1% of its host s mass .",
    "since the conservation of angular momentum along ballistic orbits in an axisymmetric galaxy obstructs gas - fueling of the centre , this process may pose an upper limit for the mass a  can reach by gas - accretion .",
    "an upper limit of this order is indeed observed among  masses inferred from the dynamics of early - type galaxies .",
