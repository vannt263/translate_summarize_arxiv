    "its seemingly endless range of applications @xcite has made tio@xmath0 one of the most studied transition metal oxides to date .",
    "much of this material s functionality in corresponding ( opto-)electronic , ( photo-)catalytic or photovoltaic applications derives not from the ideal bulk and surface structures , but is instead critically determined by intrinsic defects.@xcite among these , the oxygen vacancy and in particular its nature as a charge trapping center have been most controversially discussed.@xcite the removal of an o atom from the bulk tio@xmath0 lattice results in a single - particle defect state created from the three ti dangling bonds that point into the vacancy . the energetic position of the state depends sensitively on its electron occupancy and concomitant local lattice relaxations .",
    "this occupancy can range from two electrons in the charge - neutral defect state ( v@xmath3 ) , over one electron in the singly - charged defect state ( v@xmath4 ) , to empty in the doubly - charged state ( v@xmath5 ) .",
    "formerly prevalent seemingly contradictory schools of thought viewed the vacancy either as a shallow donor ( v@xmath5 ) that contributes to the @xmath6-type conductivity , @xcite or as an electrically inactive deep trap ( v@xmath3 ) that reduces neighboring ti atoms and thus e.g. rationalizes an experimentally observed gap state about 0.8ev below the conduction band.@xcite    for bulk rutile tio@xmath0 hybrid - functional density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations by janotti _",
    "_ @xcite recently resolved the preceding discrepancies by showing that @xmath7 is the thermodynamically by far most stable configuration for all fermi - level positions within the band gap .",
    "however , this charged donor state can trap one or two small polarons , in which excess electrons are localized on neighboring ti@xmath8 sites .",
    "the resulting weakly bound complex of shallow donor and small polarons then naturally explains all experimental findings , but has to be carefully distinguished from the neutral v@xmath3 configuration in which the electrons occupy the defect state centered on the o vacancy site itself .",
    "as it is particularly surface o vacancies that play a crucial role in many of the tio@xmath0 material applications @xcite , it is important to assess how much of this novel understanding derived for the bulk transfers also to these surface defects .",
    "corresponding first - principles calculations are , however , rather demanding . already in the bulk case , at least hybrid - functional dft is required to achieve an appropriate electron localization .",
    "@xcite even with present - day computing power this constrains the system sizes that can be accessed . at the same time",
    ", the huge dielectric constant of tio@xmath0 leads to a very large dielectric response in case of the charged defects . here ,",
    "not only lattice relaxations in the direct vicinity of the defect but the polarization of the entire semi - infinite surrounding medium contribute significantly . within the conventional periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) supercell",
    "approach this requires intricate extrapolation procedures involving supercells of increasing size.@xcite    in this situation we instead opt for first - principles embedded - cluster calculations , in which the employed full - potential scheme allows for a numerically particularly efficient application of hybrid - functional dft inside the quantum mechanic ( qm ) cluster region .  @xcite in the extended molecular mechanic ( mm ) embedding region appropriately optimized interatomic potentials provide a quantitative account of the strong tio@xmath0 polarization response .",
    "we use this setup specifically to compute the formation energies , structural relaxations , and electronic structure of the bridging o vacancy at the rutile tio@xmath0(110 ) surface .",
    "consistent with the bulk calculations of janotti _ et al .",
    "_ we find that over a wide range of fermi - level positions and oxygen chemical potentials the doubly - charged v@xmath5 state is thermodynamically clearly favored .",
    "the steeply decreasing formation energy of this charged defect with a lowering fermi level then suggests @xmath2-doping as a promising avenue to tune the surface vacancy concentrations and therewith the catalytic activity of this important material .",
    "we describe the localized surface defect in a concentric solid - state embedding approach as sketched in fig .",
    "the immediate vicinity of the defect and the rehybridization induced through it is treated at the qm level , and in particular through dft .",
    "this qm region is embedded into a much larger mm region , which accounts for the longer - ranged dielectric properties of the tio@xmath0(110 ) surface on the level of a polarizable interatomic potential . in a transition shell at the qm /",
    "mm boundary , cations are described by pseudopotentials ( pps ) to prevent a spurious overpolarization of the electron density ( aka charge leakage ) .",
    "these pps recover the long - range electrostatics of a point charge , but also have a repulsive short - range contribution which effectively mimics pauli repulsion of core electrons .",
    "a final exterior shell of point charges is added at the outer boundary of the finite mm region .",
    "these point charges have values that are fitted to reproduce the full electrostratic potential of the infinite surface inside the qm region.@xcite the next consecutive sections provide details of the dft calculations , the parametrization of the interatomic potential , and the employed surface models within this overall approach .",
    "all dft calculations have been performed with the full - potential , all - electron framework fhi - aims @xcite .",
    "electronic exchange and correlation ( xc ) is treated at the level of screened hybrid - dft , applying the hse06 functional with the default mixing of 25% exact exchange and the default screening parameter of 0.2 @xmath9.@xcite systematic test calculations showed that the _ tier2 _ numerical atomic orbital basis set and the default _ tight _ settings for the atom - centered integration grids ensure a numerical convergence of the calculated defect formation energies within @xmath10mev .",
    "spin polarization is included throughout .",
    "as pps for the transition shell we employ fhi98pp - generated @xcite ti@xmath11 kleinman - bylander pps @xcite with non - local projector functions expanded up to the @xmath12-states .",
    "further details of these potentials and their implementation into fhi - aims can be found in ref . .    .rutile",

    "literature data from experiment @xcite and dft - hse06 calculations @xcite are compared against our own calculations at the dft - hse06 level and with the parametrized interatomic potential for the mm region ( see text ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the results of the preceding section already indicate the relevance of the charged defect states , and correspondingly the hitherto barely explored necessity to reliably describe them with electronic structure calculations . when moving to the fully relaxed defect formation energies , our qm /",
    "mm scheme is limited by the shortcomings of the polarizable interatomic potential with respect to the static dielectric constants . thus restricting structural relaxation to the qm region ( and maintaining the full electronic polarization as in the previous section )",
    ", we obtain the defect formation energies compiled in table [ table4 ] . comparing the entries for the neutral defect in table [ table3 ] and [ table4 ]",
    "we observe only a minute lowering of @xmath19 by 0.2ev for the closed - shell singlet electronic configuration ( henceforth denoted as singlet ) at all three cluster sizes .",
    "the additional lattice response accounted for in the relaxed calculations is thus quickly converged over the few atomic shells contained in the finite qm clusters . while only a marginal quantitative effect for the singlet , it is only this short - range structural relaxation that stabilizes the neutral open - shell singlet and triplet configurations at all .",
    "nevertheless , also for the degenerate lowest - energy such configurations ( henceforth denoted as triplet / singlet ) quick convergence with the size of the qm region is achieved .    in line with the expectations from the large static tio@xmath0 dielectric constants ,",
    "the additional lattice - polarization stabilization of the charged defects is instead significant even when only accounting for the relaxation of the nearest - neighbor atomic shells in the qm region .",
    "comparing again the corresponding entries in tables [ table3 ] and [ table4 ] , this stabilization is of the order of 2ev for the singly - charged defect and amounts even to around 4ev for the doubly - charged defect . as polarization of the environment scales with the square of the charge , cf .",
    "( [ eq : pol_surface ] ) , this drastic increase is not unexpected . at the latest for the @xmath7 defect no convergence can concomitantly be achieved over the present range of qm cluster sizes . in view of the strong lattice relaxations calculated for this defect ,",
    "this is also not surprising . with an outwards relaxation of up to 0.45 the nearest - neighbor ti atoms around the defect",
    "exhibit the largest displacements .",
    "corresponding displacements in the two larger ti@xmath20o@xmath21 and ti@xmath22o@xmath23 qm clusters differ by less than 0.05 , proving that this shortest - range polarization contribution is well converged at these cluster sizes .",
    "however , in the largest ti@xmath22o@xmath23 qm cluster the next two shells of ti atoms still show maximum displacements of 0.12 and 0.05 , respectively .",
    "these non - negligible relaxation contributions can no longer be captured with the smaller clusters .",
    "just accounting for the lattice relaxation inside the finite qm region is therefore not sufficient to reliably determine the formation energies of the charged defects .",
    "the relaxation patterns possible inside the largest ti@xmath22o@xmath23 qm cluster would require a @xmath24 surface unit - cell in pbc supercell calculations .",
    "due to the periodic images the relaxation patterns outside this unit cell are spurious .",
    "our findings for the qm / mm setup are therefore paralleled by the equivalent insight that even correspondingly large surface unit - cells are not sufficient to absolutely converge charged defects in pbc calculations .",
    "as these system sizes are at the upper limit of what is presently tractable at the hybrid functional level , extrapolation procedures are thus required within the pbc approach .",
    "@xcite within our qm / mm approach we can find an analogue in the analytic correction procedure described in the last section . indeed , using exactly the same radius @xmath25 for each of the three cluster sizes as established in the unrelaxed calculations we can reproduce the @xmath19 of table [ table4 ] with the same accuracy as was the case in table [ table3 ] ( not shown ) . here , this means that we used for @xmath26 in @xmath27 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol_surface ] ) exactly the high - frequency value that corresponds on average to the ones of the polarizable interatomic potential .    with this confidence",
    "we apply the approximate analytic correction also for the calculation of fully relaxed formation energies . for this",
    ", we now use as @xmath26 in @xmath27 the isotropic average of the large static dielectric constants derived from hse06 , cf .",
    "table [ table1 ] .",
    "keeping exactly the same radii @xmath25 as before in the calculation of @xmath27 , this approach thus accounts for the full lattice and electronic relaxation explicitly in the qm region , and accounts for the same full lattice and electronic polarization on the continuum level outside of the qm region .",
    "the results compiled in table [ table4 ] indicate another sizable stabilization in particular for the doubly - charged @xmath7 defect , the formation energy of which is now also converged over the two larger qm clusters .",
    "likely , the obtained @xmath19 values nevertheless still slightly overestimate the true relaxed formation energies , as the outermost atoms in the qm region are not allowed to relax to avoid artifacts from an imperfect qm / mm coupling . from small variations of the employed radius @xmath25 in @xmath27",
    "to also effectively account for the corresponding shell of atoms , we estimate that this relaxation would lower the formation energy of @xmath28 ( @xmath7 ) by another 0.1ev ( 0.3ev ) .",
    "we therefore arrive at final values for the formation energies in the o - rich limit and for a fermi - level position at the vbm of @xmath29ev ( v@xmath3 singlet ) , @xmath30ev ( v@xmath3 triplet / singlet ) , @xmath31ev ( v@xmath4 ) and @xmath32ev ( v@xmath5 ) .",
    "the stated error bars hereby reflect conservative estimates accounting for the uncertainties implied by the analytic correction approach and the convergence with the qm cluster size .",
    "this uncertainty in particular for the doubly - charged vacancy is not entirely satisfying .",
    "notwithstanding , we note that a similar uncertainty did arise in the calculation of the bulk defect formation energies through the extrapolation procedure required in the employed pbc supercell approach @xcite , whereas a reliable polarization - converged calculation of @xmath19 of the charged surface defects at the hybrid - functional level has never even been attempted .",
    "intriguingly , our results are on the contrary very robust against the inaccuracy introduced by the still large deviation of the static hse06 dielectric constants with respect to experiment , cf .  table  [ table1 ] . as apparent from the nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol_surface ] ) values for @xmath26 smaller than the hse06-derived value will cause large variations in the long - range polarization correction . varying the @xmath26 employed in the analytic correction from the small value corresponding to the mm high - frequency dielectric constants to the one corresponding to the static hse06 dielectric constants thus led to the just discussed large changes of the formation energies of the charged defects .",
    "however , a further increase of @xmath26 to match the experimental dielectric properties of table  [ table1 ] instead yields only a negligible further stabilization of the singly- ( doubly- ) charged defect by 0.01ev ( 0.03ev ) .    in total",
    ", structural relaxation therefore lowers the formation energies of the closed - shell @xmath33 singlet by 0.3ev , of v@xmath4 by 1.6ev , and of v@xmath5 by 5.6ev . in the work by janotti _",
    "et al . _ for the bulk o vacancy",
    "the corresponding values were 0.3ev , 0.9ev and 3.5ev .",
    "@xcite this suggests a significantly stronger stabilization of the charged defects at the surface , which one may attribute to a generally larger structural flexibility of surface atoms . in light of the preceding discussion on the insensitivity of the polarization - response to small variations away from the hse06 dielectric properties ,",
    "this conclusion should not be affected by the use of a tailored hse functional with a slightly different exact exchange mixing in this preceding work .",
    "more likely , the different functional will affect the description of the short - range qm rehybridization and therewith prevent a direct comparison of the absolute defect formation energies in the bulk and at the surface . compared to our surface values of 5.3ev ( v@xmath3 singlet ) , 1.6ev ( v@xmath4 ) and @xmath34,ev ( v@xmath5 ) , janotti _ et al .",
    "_ report 5.3ev , 2.2ev and @xmath35ev for the bulk , respectively .",
    "@xcite overall , the numbers are intriguingly similar .",
    "considering also the uncertainties due to pbc extrapolation or qm / mm convergence we can , however , not make any more detailed statements . even though the calculated @xmath36 reflect the same trend we can therefore not comment on the strong surface segregation tendency obtained previously at the gga or gga+u level .",
    "@xcite corresponding ( polarization - response unconverged ) calculations had predicted a higher stability of the surface o vacancy by @xmath37ev as compared to its counterpart in the bulk .",
    "is used as zero reference for @xmath38 .",
    "the y - axis scales on the left and right correspond to @xmath19 in the the o - poor and o - rich limit , respectively , and are correspondingly shifted by 4.07ev , cf .",
    "( [ o - poor]).,width=7 ]    as clear from eq .",
    "( [ formation ] ) the defect formation energies depend on the reservoirs available for the removed species , i.e.  the oxygen chemical potential and the electronic fermi level .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] therefore extends the previous discussion for the o - rich limit and for a fermi - level position at the vbm , and shows the different @xmath19 as a function of the fermi - level position and with @xmath39-axis scales for both the o - rich and o - poor limit . for any fermi - level position within the band gap",
    ", the doubly - charged v@xmath5 defect exhibits the lowest formation energies ; a situation that was equivalently obtained before for the bulk o vacancy .",
    "@xcite when also accounting for the full lattice relaxation , the transition levels @xmath40 and @xmath41 are thus located above the cbm , i.e.  the surface o vacancy is a shallow donor .    even in the limit of strong @xmath6-type doping with a concomitant fermi level close to the cbm",
    "the energetic gap to the neutral closed - shell singlet @xmath33 with two electrons bound in the localized defect orbitals is still quite large . in full agreement with previous theoretical studies @xcite",
    "the equally charge - neutral open - shell triplet / singlet is obtained as an energetically preferred electronic configuration . however , in contrast to the intrinsically neutral defect , this would instead correspond to a situation where the charged defect has trapped two small polarons @xcite . in our calculations , this situation only becomes energetically degenerate to the bare doubly - charged v@xmath5 defect for a fermi - level position right at the cbm , cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] . here , we have to recall though that deskins _",
    "et al . _ reported a polaron localization in the sub - surface layer , which we could not confirm with the present hybrid - functional qm / mm setup ( _ vide supra _ ) . in their scheme , this sub - surface configuration was 0.87ev more stable than the surface polaron triplet / singlet configuration we obtain as most stable , cf .",
    "if the sub - surface solution by deskins _ et al . _ is indeed physical , this would thus lower the open - shell triplet / singlet line in fig .",
    "the resulting lowering of the transition level @xmath41 to 0.44ev below the cbm would then indicate the possibility of polaron trapping at the surface defects for corresponding fermi - level positions . as discussed by janotti _",
    "_ @xcite it is such trapped polarons ( trapped possibly at the surface o defect but equally at other surface and bulk defects ) , not the o surface defect itself that are responsible for the defect state in the band gap observed in numerous experimental studies @xcite .",
    "for fermi - level positions further away from the cbm , the formation energy of the v@xmath5 defect decreases rapidly , cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] . under o - rich conditions",
    "it is only this steep lowering of @xmath19 that eventually leads to values consistent with appreciable defect concentrations .",
    "this is consistent with experimental reports on increased defect concentrations upon @xmath2-doping.@xcite equivalent reductions of @xmath19 ( and concomitant increases of the defect concentration ) can , of course , also be achieved with less o - rich conditions , i.e.  by lowering the o chemical potential . a strong presence of bridging - oxygen vacancies at the tio@xmath0(110 )",
    "surface has indeed frequently been observed in ultra - high vacuum experiments.@xcite as apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the lowering of @xmath19 with lower @xmath38 or @xmath42 is in fact so strong , that we eventually obtain negative formation energies .",
    "this unphysical result indicating a lattice instability is an artifact of the persistent use of defect formation energies calculated for the dilute limit . under conditions corresponding to increased defect concentrations , defect - defect interactions as well as",
    "the build - up of a space - charge region @xcite would in reality modify the formation energies to suppress negative values.@xcite in view of the huge energetic preference of the doubly - charged defect presently obtained for such conditions , it is , however , unlikely that this will change the energetic ordering of neutral and charged defects .",
    "we presented a solid - state qm / mm approach with a polarizable interatomic potential optimized to match the dft xc functional employed in the qm region and analytical corrections for long - range polarization effects .",
    "corresponding embedded - cluster calculations provide a first determination of the defect formation energies of neutral and charged o vacancies at the tio@xmath0(110 ) surface at the hybrid - functional dft level and containing a converged contribution of the strong dielectric response of this material .",
    "the stabilization of the singly- ( @xmath43 ) and doubly- ( @xmath44 ) charged surface defect through lattice relaxation is indeed found to be sizable , i.e.  of the order of 1.6ev and 5.6ev , respectively .",
    "it is thus even larger than previously obtained for the bulk o vacancy@xcite , a fact that we attribute to the generally larger structural flexibility of surface atoms .",
    "the stabilization of in particular the doubly - charged @xmath44 defect is large enough to make it the thermodynamically most stable state for any fermi - level position in the band gap .",
    "however , under the uncertainties of our approach we can not exclude a possible trapping of small polarons at the charged defect for fermi - level positions close to the cbm .",
    "the situation for the surface o vacancy would then be fully equivalent to the one discussed by janotti _",
    "_ before for the bulk.@xcite the surface o vacancy is thus a shallow donor and the electronic defect state within the band gap observed experimentally results from trapped polarons , not from the intrinsic o defect itself .    within the nature of a charged defect ,",
    "the formation energy of the @xmath44 surface o vacancy varies with the fermi - level position in the band gap . in line with experimental reports",
    "this predicts largely increased vacancy concentrations upon @xmath2-doping .",
    "as surface vacancies are frequently discussed as reactive centers , systematic variations of doping concentrations may therefore provide an important avenue to tune the catalytic activity of tio@xmath0 .",
    "the presented embedded - cluster approach allows to efficiently address charged reaction intermediates or their binding to charged defects both under a converged account of the large polarization response and at hybrid - functional dft or even beyond .",
    "this predestines the approach to quantitatively assess this avenue for this and other ( polarizable ) metal oxides .",
