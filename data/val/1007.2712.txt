    "t2k ( tokai - to - kamioka )  @xcite is a long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment . in t2k",
    ", an intense muon neutrino beam is produced with a proton synchrotron in j - parc facility and sent to the massive super - kamiokande detector 295  km away .",
    "the main goals of t2k are a sensitive search for the @xmath0 appearance from @xmath1 , which is related to the yet - unmeasured neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 , and precise measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in order to achieve the aimed precision , good understanding of the neutrino beam properties and neutrino - nucleus interaction",
    "are indispensable .",
    "the near detector ( nd280 ) complex is placed at about 280  m from the proton target to provide this information .",
    "the t2k - nd280  @xcite consists of several sub - detectors with specific and complimentary functions .",
    "as the basic elements for the particle detection , most of detectors use the plastic scintillator read out via wavelength shifting ( wls ) fibers .",
    "this is a widely used technique , especially in recent accelerator neutrino experiments  @xcite . in those experiments , multi - anode pmts ( mapmts )",
    "have been used as the photosensor . for t2k ,",
    "mapmt is not suitable because some of the detectors have to operate under a magnetic field of 0.2  t provided by a dipole magnet originally built for ua1 experiment at cern , and also because the available space is very limited .",
    "we selected the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) as the photosensor for nd280 and started the development in cooperation with hamamatsu photonics and kek detector technology project  @xcite .",
    "for nd280 , 64,000 mppcs are used in total .",
    "after three years of study , we developed an mppc that satisfied our requirements and started the mass production in february 2008 . because it was the first time that the mppcs are used on such a large scale , it was necessary to develop a method to characterize each device for quality assurance purpose . in order to characterize a large number of mppcs",
    ", we have developed a system that simultaneously measures 64 mppcs at kyoto university . using this test system ,",
    "we have measured 17,686 mppcs used for two sub - detectors of nd280 , called ingrid  @xcite and fgd  @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the design of the test system , testing procedure and summary of measured performances of t2k - mppc are presented .",
    "the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) is a new photodetector manufactured by hamamatsu photonics , japan  @xcite .",
    "an mppc consists of many ( 100 to @xmath51000 ) small avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) , each with an area of either 25@xmath625 , 50@xmath650 or 100@xmath6100  @xmath7m@xmath8 , in an area of 19  mm@xmath8 .",
    "each apd micropixel independently works in limited geiger mode with an applied voltage a few volts above the breakdown voltage ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "when a photoelectron is produced , it induces a geiger avalanche .",
    "the avalanche is passively quenched by a resistor untegrated to each pixel .",
    "the output charge @xmath10 from a single pixel is independent of the number of produced photoelectrons within the pixel , and can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the applied voltage and @xmath13 is the capacitance of the pixel .",
    "the overvoltage , @xmath14 is the parameter that controls the performance of mppc as we will see later .",
    "it is known that @xmath15 is dependent on the temperature with a coefficient of @xmath16  mv / k  @xcite . combining the output from all the pixels , the total charge from an mppc",
    "is quantized to multiples of @xmath10 and proportional to the number of pixels that underwent geiger discharge ( `` _ _ fired _ _ '' ) .",
    "the number of fired pixels is proportional to the number of injected photons if the number of photons is small compared to the total number of pixels .",
    "thus , the mppc has an excellent photon counting capability as long as the number of photo - electron does not approach the total number of pixels in the device .    for an mppc , the operating voltage",
    "@xmath12 is a few volts above the breakdown voltage and well below 100  v. the pixel capacitance @xmath13 is on the order of 10100  ff , giving a gain of 10@xmath1710@xmath18 .",
    "these features enable us to read out the signal from the mppc with simple electronics .",
    "in addition , because the thickness of the amplification region is a few @xmath7 m , an mppc is insensitive to the magnetic field and has a fast response .",
    "the photon detection efficiency ( pde ) of an mppc is expressed as a product of three effects : @xmath19 the geometrical efficiency @xmath20 represents the fraction of active area in a micropixel .",
    "based on a measurement  @xcite , @xmath20 is about 0.6 for an mppc with 50@xmath650  @xmath7 m pixel size .",
    "the quantum efficiency of the apd , qe , depends on the wavelength of photon and is typically 0.70.8 for the wavelength of 400500  nm , the range of current interest .",
    "the probability of inducing a geiger discharge when a photoelectron is generated , @xmath21 , depends on @xmath22 .",
    "the last factor introduces the @xmath22 dependence of pde .",
    "the dark noise of mppc at the room temperature is dominated by the geiger discharge induced by thermally generated electron - hole pairs .",
    "because it is amplified with the identical process , a dark noise pulse can not be distinguished from the signal induced by the external photon irradiation , although the dark noise is mainly at the single photoelectron level in absence of the cross - talk effect described below .",
    "the dark noise rate of mppc is proportional to the area . for 50  @xmath7 m pixel type mppc ,",
    "the dark noise rate per active area is about 300500  khz / mm@xmath8 at 25  with a gain of 7.5@xmath23 .",
    "there are two known processes which give an additional charge to the original signal ; the cross - talk between neighboring micropixels and afterpulse .",
    "the origin of the cross - talk is presumed to be optical photons emitted during avalanche  @xcite which enter neighboring micropixels and trigger another geiger discharge .",
    "it gives an additional charge output at the same time as the original geiger discharge .",
    "the afterpulse of mppc is considered to be due to delayed release of carriers trapped at lattice defects , giving a time - correlated but delayed charge output to the original signal  @xcite .    in order to evaluate the mppc performance ,",
    "it is important to measure key parameters such as @xmath15 , pde , dark noise rate , cross - talk and afterpulse probabilities together with their dependence on the temperature and applied voltage .      a picture of the mppc for the t2k - nd280 ( s10362 - 13 - 050c ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mppc ] and the major specifications is summarized in table  [ tab : spec ] .",
    "we use the 1.0  mm diameter kuraray y11(200)ms wls fiber for the nd280 detector .",
    "the sensitive area of the mppc is enlarged from 1@xmath61  mm@xmath8 of those on catalogue ( s10362 - 11 - 050c ) to 1.3@xmath61.3  mm@xmath8 , so that we can minimize the light loss at the optical contact with a simple coupler .",
    "the size of apd pixel is 50@xmath650  @xmath7m@xmath8 and the number of apd pixels  .",
    "the large pde of mppc results in a light yield sufficiently large to safely reject the dark noise , which is mainly at a single photoelectron level .",
    "in addition , thanks to the pulsed neutrino beam timing , the random dark noise has only little effect for the neutrino event reconstruction .",
    ".specifications of t2k - mppc(s10362 - 13 - 050c ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "for the t2k near neutrino detectors , we have developed the multi - pixel photon counter ( mppc ) with 1.3@xmath61.3  mm@xmath8 active area and with 667 50  @xmath7 m pitch pixels ( s10362 - 13 - 050c ) . in total ,",
    "about 64,500 mppcs were produced for t2k from february 2008 to february 2009 .    at kyoto university , we have successfully developed the system and technique to characterize a large number of mppcs , and tested 17,686 mppcs .",
    "the performance of mppcs has been confirmed to satisfy our requirements .",
    "the failure rate is found to be about 0.5% .",
    "the authors are grateful to the solid state division of hamamatsu photonics for providing us test samples during the development .",
    "we appreciate useful suggestions from the members of t2k nd280 photosensor group .",
