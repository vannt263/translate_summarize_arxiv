    "with the advent of light - front field theory , one can be quite hopeful to develop a connection between quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the relativistic constituent quark model which is used in various electroweak form factor calculations .",
    "qcd provides a fundamental description of hadronic and nuclear structure in terms of elementary quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "it is very succesful in the perturbative regime , for instance when it is used in the explanation of the evolution of distribution functions in deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "there , the basic hard interaction is described by perturbative qcd and the electro - weak interaction .",
    "the soft parts , distribution and fragmentation functions , are non - perturbative ingredients , which are less well understood .",
    "lattice calculations are becoming increasingly accurate , but there is still much room and need for other non - perturbative approaches .",
    "it is part of the nature of the description of hadronic systems in terms of quarks and gluons that the characteristic momenta are of the same order or even very much larger than the masses of the particles involved .",
    "therefore a relativistic treatment is called for .",
    "a very promising technique is light - front dynamics ( lfd ) , which treats relativistic many - body effects in a consistent way @xcite . in lfd",
    "a fock - space expansion of bound states is made .",
    "the wave function @xmath1 describes the component with @xmath2 constituents , with longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath3 , perpendicular momentum @xmath4 and helicity @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "it is the aim of lfd to determine those wave functions and use them in conjunction with hard scattering amplitudes to describe the properties of hadrons and their response to electroweak probes .",
    "recently , important steps were taken towards a realization of this goal . in the work of brodsky , hiller and mccartor @xcite ,",
    "it is demonstrated how to solve the problem of renormalizing light - front hamiltonian theories while maintaining lorentz symmetry and other symmetries .",
    "( the genesis of the work presented in @xcite may be found in @xcite and additional examples including the use of lfd methods to solve the bound - state problems in field theory can be found in the review @xcite ) .",
    "these results are indicative of the great potential of lfd for a fundamental description of non - perturbative effects in qcd . however ,",
    "at present there are no realistic results available for wave functions of hadrons based on qcd alone . in order to calculate the response of hadrons to external probes",
    ", one might resort to the use of model wave functions . this way to estimate matrix elements",
    "was used by ji et al.@xcite . the same reasons that make lfd so attractive to solve bound - state problems in field theory make it also useful for a relativistic description of nuclear systems .",
    "presently , it is realized that a parametrization of nuclear reactions in terms of non - relativistic wave functions must fail .",
    "lf methods have the advantage that they are formally similar to time - ordered many - body theories , yet provide relativistically invariant observables .    until now we have sketched a rather rosy picture for the application of lfd to hadron physics . however , not all is well and this is just the reason for the present investigation .",
    "since the 1980 s it has been assumed that the observables computed in the framework of lfd using the methods of perturbation theory are invariants , just as in covariant perturbation theory .",
    "many authors have shown that lfd has this feature in particular cases and some years ago some general statements to the same effect could be made @xcite . a case in point",
    "is the calculation of a current matrix element in quantum field theory .",
    "a typical amplitude is given by the triangle diagram .",
    "one encounters this diagram e.g. when computing the pion form factor ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the vertices denoted by @xmath7 are coupling constants in covariant perturbation theory .",
    "the hard scattering process is the absorption of a photon of momentum @xmath8 by a ( anti-)quark . in the lfd approach the covariant amplitude is replaced by a series of lf time - ordered diagrams . in the case of the triangle diagram",
    "they are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the first of these two diagrams is easily interpreted in terms of the lf wave functions @xmath7 .",
    "however , the other diagram has a vertex that can again be written in the same way as before , but it contains also another vertex , denoted by @xmath9 , that can not be written as a lf wave function .",
    "it is a new element in lfd .",
    "we call this vertex the _ non - wave - function vertex_. in order to compute the form factors in the time - like region , the contributions from these vertices must be included .",
    "semileptonic meson decay processes also require the contributions from these vertices .",
    "one may try to avoid using them by choosing special kinematic conditions .",
    "it is known however that this will not be a simple task @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate the contributions from the non - wave - function vertices .",
    "we construct both the wave - function and non - wave - function vertices using pointlike covariant ones .",
    "the model used here is essentially an extension of mankiewicz and sawicki s @xmath10-dimensional quantum field theory model @xcite , which was later reinvestigated by several others @xcite .",
    "the starting model wave function is the solution of the covariant bethe - salpeter equation in the ladder approximation with a relativistic version of the contact interaction @xcite .",
    "the covariant model wave function is a product of two free single particle propagators , the overall momentum - conserving dirac delta function , and a constant vertex function .",
    "consequently , all our form factor calculations are various ways of evaluating the feynman triangle diagram in quantum field theory .",
    "the importance of the contributions of the non - wave - function vertices was investigated in two cases : the electromagnetic form factors of a scalar and a pseudoscalar meson with spin-1/2 constituents .",
    "we also calculated the same form factor of a scalar meson with spin-0 constituents to see the spin effects . in 3 + 1 dimensions both the covariant and the lf calculations are divergent and the model without any smeared vertex for the fermion loop is not well defined .",
    "this is in dramatic contrast to the case of spin-0 ( boson ) constituents , where regularization is not needed at all . in order to disentangle the issue of the non - wave - function vertices from the need of regularization",
    ", we performed our calculations in 1 + 1 dimensions , where at least the covariant calculations for spin-1/2 constituents give finite results .",
    "it is commonly believed and widely used that the lf energy integration of the covariant feynman amplitude generates the corresponding equivalent amplitude in the lfd .",
    "as we will show in this work , however , the equivalence between the lfd and the covariant feynman calculation is not always guaranteed . the bad component of the current , @xmath0 , with spin-1/2 constituents exhibits a persistent end - point singularity in the contribution from the non - wave - function vertex . unless the divergence in this contribution is properly subtracted , the singular behavior leads to an infinitely different result from that obtained by the covariant feynman calculation .",
    "ensuring the equivalence to the feynman amplitude , we have identified the divergent term that needs to be removed from @xmath0 .",
    "only after the identified term is subtracted , the result is covariant and satisfies the current conservation .    in the next section ( section  [ sec.2 ] )",
    ", we present both the covariant feynman calculations and the lf calculations using the lf energy integration for the electromagnetic form factors of a pseudoscalar and a scalar meson with spin-1/2 constituents as well as the same form factor of a scalar meson with spin-0 constituents .",
    "section  [ sec.6 ] contains the numerical estimates of both the wave - function and non - wave - function vertices to the electromagnetic form factors of each case presented in section  [ sec.2 ] .",
    "the conclusion and discussion follow in section  [ sec.7 ] .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors can be extracted from the matrix elements of the current @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the charge of the meson and @xmath14 is the square of the four momentum transfer . if one uses the plus - component , @xmath15 , the lf calculation gives two finite contributions , the wave - function part and the non - wave - function part , that add up to the covariant result , as expected .",
    "the importance of the non - wave - function contribution varies strongly with the momentum transfer and depends sensitively on the binding energy of the meson . for small values of @xmath16 and small binding energy ,",
    "the wave - function part is dominant , but elsewhere the non - wave - function is essential for agreement between the lf calculation and the covariant results .",
    "the form factor can also be extracted from the minus - component of the current , @xmath17 .",
    "covariance guarantees that it makes no difference whether the form factor is determined using the plus or the minus current matrix element . as lfd",
    "is not manifestly covariant , it may happen that @xmath0 leads to a form factor different from the one determined using @xmath18 . as we show in this section ,",
    "the matrix element of @xmath0 diverges in lfd . unless one regulates @xmath0",
    ", the current can not be conserved . to assure the current conservation ,",
    "it is crucial to identify the term that causes the divergence .",
    "we have identified this term exactly and found that it is an infinite function of the momentum transfer .",
    "if this infinite term is subtracted , the two lf contributions become finite as it must be in the conserved current . moreover",
    ", their sum equals again the covaraint result as expected .",
    "however , the regularized lf contributions are different from the two parts of the form factor extracted from the plus current .",
    "the differences grow with increasing binding energy .      the covariant fermion triangle - loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) for the pseudoscalar meson leads to the amplitude given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fermion mass and @xmath21 modulo the obvious charge factor @xmath13 is the normalization constant fixed by the unity of the form factor at zero momentum transfer . even though we will present the unequal constituent mass case such as the kaon in the next section of our numerical analysis , for the clarity of presentation we will focus in this section on the equal mass case , such as the pion , only .",
    "the usual feynman parametrization and the covariant integration yields @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the meson mass . for @xmath24",

    "as we extensively discussed in section  [ sec.2 ] , the subtraction of the end - point singularity is not required in the scalar quark case in contrast to the spinor quark case . in the scalar quark case , it is interesting to note that @xmath70 and @xmath72 reveal a large difference compare to the spinor quark case , while @xmath88 and @xmath67 are very similar to the spinor quark case .",
    "we find that the huge cancellation between @xmath70 and @xmath72 observed in the spinor quark case does occur in the scalar quark case only for very strong binding , and the most of @xmath89 is saturated by @xmath72 .",
    "however , the tiny contribution from @xmath70 near @xmath80 grows as the binding gets weaker and we have demonstrated the dominance of the valence part in the small binding limit regardless of the spin content , as discussed above .",
    "9 shows the corresponding results for the `` s - kaon '' when the spinor quark is replaced by a bosonic quark .",
    "while the general features are similar to the spinor quark case , the bosonic quarks are more tightly bound together than the spinor quarks so that the charge radius of the meson is smaller than the case of spinor quarks as one might expect from the pauli s exclusion principle .",

    "in this paper , we have analyzed both the plus and minus components of the current quantized on the light - front to compute the electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar and scalar mesons .",
    "we considered spin-1/2 consituents as well as spin-0 constituents and found dramatic differences between the two cases . comparing with the covariant feynman calculations , we notice that the common belief of equivalence between the manifestly covariant calculation and the lf calculation linked by the lf energy integration of the feynman amplitude is not always realized .",
    "the minus component of the lf current generated by the fermion loop has a persistent end - point singularity that must be removed to assure covariance and current conservation .",
    "a similar singularity was observed in the calculation of the fermion self - energy in @xcite and @xcite",
    ". the plus component of the lf current , however , is immune to this disorder and provides a form factor identical to the one obtained doing the covariant feynman calculation .",
    "this phenomenon is also associated with the spin - effect of the constituents because the calculation with the scalar(spin-0 ) constituents does not have the same symptom .",
    "decomposing the lf amplitude into the wave - function and non - wave - function parts , it is interesting to note that the end - point singularity exists only in the non - wave - function vertex contribution .    even after the singularity is removed , the minus component of the current sustains the zero - mode contribution while the plus component is free from the zero - mode .",
    "we have numerically estimated the importance of the non - wave - function vertices in all three cases that we discussed in section  [ sec.2 ] .",
    "we considered also the unequal constituent mass cases such as the kaon form factor .",
    "we find that the behaviors of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are trimendously different between pseudoscalar and scalar meson cases , while @xmath92 and @xmath93 have very similar features in both cases .",
    "the huge but remarkably exact cancellation between @xmath90 and @xmath91 shown in the scalar meson case persists even if the spinor quark is replaced by the bosonic quark . in the bosonic quark case , however , the binding between the constituents is stronger than the spinor quark case .",
    "we also notice that the zero - mode @xmath94 diminishes as the binding gets weaker .",
    "our results are quite consistent to the earlier observation @xcite exhibiting the smaller zero - mode contribution in the heavier quark systems . in all of these cases ,",
    "our results show that if the meson is weakly bound then the contributions from the wave - function and the non - wave - function vertices to the plus current are separately almost the same as those for the minus current .",
    "of course , their sums add up to the same number as the covariant feynman result in both the plus and minus cases .",
    "the calculations carried out so far are semi - realistic as the model was 1 + 1-dimensional and only a point - vertex was considered . it is clear from a formal analysis of the 3 + 1-dimensional case , however , that a singularity of the same form will occur in the matrix element of @xmath0 calculated in lfd regardless of dimensionality .",
    "a recent analysis of the burkhardt - cottingham sum - rule seems to reveal a similar divergence in the polarized spin-1/2 structure functions @xcite .",
    "while the additional regularization may be provided by smearing the point - vertex with a realistic wave - function in the 3 + 1-dimensional covariant treatment of the current , the identification of the singular term as we achieved in this work would still be necessary for the smeared vertex cases .",
    "the importance of the non - wave - function parts may nevertheless differ numerically from the 1 + 1-dimensional case .",
    "this point is presently under investigation .",
