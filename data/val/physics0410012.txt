    "coupled - cluster ( cc ) method  @xcite is a powerful and ubiquitous technique for solving quantum many - body problem .",
    "let us briefly recapitulate general features of the cc method , so we can motivate our further discussion",
    ". at the heart of the cc method lies the exponential ansatz for the exact many - body wavefunction @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the cluster operator involving amplitudes @xmath7 of @xmath8-fold particle - hole excitations from the reference slater determinant @xmath9 . the parametrization   is derived from rigorous re - summation of many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) series . from solving the eigenvalue equation one determines the cluster amplitudes and the associated energies .",
    "while the ansatz  ( [ eq : ccparam ] ) contains an _ infinite _ number of terms due to expansion of the exponent , the resulting equations for cluster amplitudes @xmath7 contain a _",
    "finite _ number of terms .",
    "this simplifying property is unfortunately lost when the resulting wavefunctions are used in calculations of matrix elements : upon expansion of exponents the number of terms becomes infinite .",
    "indeed , consider matrix elements of an operator @xmath10 , e.g. , transition amplitude between two states @xmath11 with normalization @xmath12 .",
    "it is clear that both the numerator and denominator have infinite numbers of terms , e.g. , @xmath13 in this paper we address a question of partially summing the terms of the above expansion for matrix elements , so that the result subsumes an infinite number of terms .",
    "more specifically we are interested in transitions between states of univalent atoms , such as alkali - metal atoms .",
    "there has been a number of relativistic coupled - cluster calculations for these systems @xcite . in particular , calculations",
    "@xcite ignore the non - linear terms ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) in the expansion  ( [ eq : zmelseries ] ) ; we will designate this approximation as linearized coupled - cluster ( lcc ) method .",
    "at the same time , it is well established that for the univalent atoms an important chain of many - body diagrams for matrix elements comes from so - called random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "a direct comparison of the rpa series and the truncated lcc expansion in ref .",
    "@xcite leads to a conclusion that a fraction of the rpa chain is missed due to the omitted non - linear terms .",
    "one of the methods to correct for the missing rpa diagrams has been investigated in ref .  @xcite .",
    "these authors replaced the bare matrix elements with the dressed matrix elements as prescribed by the rpa method .",
    "such a direct rpa dressing involved a partial subset of diagrams already included in the cc method , i.e. , it leads to a double - counting of diagrams . to partially rectify this shortcoming , the authors of ref .  @xcite",
    "have manually removed certain leading - order diagrams , higher - order terms being doubly counted .",
    "here we present an alternative infinite - summation scheme for rpa chain that avoids the double counting and thus a manual removal of the `` extra '' diagrams .",
    "in addition to the rpa - like dressing of the coupled - cluster diagrams for matrix elements , we consider another subset of diagrams that leads to a dressing of particle and hole lines in the cc diagrams .",
    "the leading order corrections due to the dressing scheme presented here arise in the fourth order of mbpt , and in this paper we present a detailed comparison with the relevant fourth - order diagrams . finally , we illustrate our approach with relativistic computation of hyperfine - structure constants and dipole matrix elements for cs atom .",
    "in addition to dressing corrections we incorporate certain classes of diagrams from the direct fourth - order mbpt calculation ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the result is complete through the fourth order . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the reported calculations are the first calculations for cs complete through the fourth order of mbpt .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we present a more extensive discussion of the cc formalism in section  [ sec : ccformalism ] .",
    "further we dress particle and hole lines in section  [ sec : particlehole ] , and discuss rpa - like dressing in section  [ sec : rpa ] .",
    "the present paper may be considered as an all - order extension of forth - order calculation  @xcite , and in section  [ sec : iv ] we present an illustrative comparison with the iv - order diagrams .",
    "finally , the designed summation schemes are illustrated numerically in section  [ sec : numerics ] and the conclusions are drawn in section  [ sec : conclusion ] . unless noted otherwise , atomic units , @xmath16 ,",
    "are used throughout the paper .",

    "we explicitly specify the state @xmath22 of the valence electron , so that the proper reference eigenstate @xmath9 of @xmath19 is @xmath23 , where pseudo - vacuum state @xmath24 specifies the occupied core .    for open - shell systems a general cc parametrization reads  @xcite @xmath25 where curly brackets denote normal product of operators . for univalent system",

    "a further _ linearized _ ( lccsd ) approximation consists in neglecting non - linear terms in the expansion of exponent in eq.([eq : ccparamopenshell ] ) , i.e. , @xmath39    as discussed in the introduction , the cluster amplitudes can be found from solving a proper analog of the eigen - value equation .",

    "has to be rewritten using as the seed object the underlying structure of the unquenched lines produced by a horizontal cross - cut through a diagram .",
    "now we specialize our discussion of the rpa - like dressing to the cluster operator truncated at single and double excitations . in this ccsd approximation",
    "we obtain for the bare rpa - like insertion @xmath121 notice that one has to be careful when dealing with the first ( singles @xmath122 singles ) term ; it is represented by a disconnected diagram and may produce undesirable disconnected diagrams for matrix elements , eq .  .",

    ", we immediately derive expressions for the dressed matrix elements and the rpa - dressed valence doubles .",
    "for example , @xmath123 here we omitted a small contribution to @xmath124 , eq .",
    ", from the product of core singles . as discussed in section  [ sec : iv ] this contribution would arise in the higher orders ( sixth order ) of mbpt .",
    "practically , we notice that among the dominant lccsd diagrams shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : zsdrepresentative ] , the particle - hole vertex occurs only in the rpa diagram @xmath125 .",
    "focusing on this particular diagram , the `` upgraded '' @xmath125 is simply @xmath126 notice that the use of the rpa - dressed matrix elements to upgrade the @xmath125 diagram , such as @xmath127 does not lead to the identical result , because it misses dressing of the @xmath128 vertex .",
    "moreover , we found numerically that dressing of both vertexes , as in more general eq .  , is equally important .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that with the rpa - like dressing scheme proposed here , the ccsd calculations would recover the entire chain of rpa diagrams .",
    "however , if the calculations of the wavefunctions are done using the linearized version of the coupled - cluster equations ( as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , a part of the rpa diagrams would still be missing  @xcite . to summarize ,",
    "the inclusion of the ccsd non - linear terms in the cc equations is crucial for a fully consistent treatment of the rpa sequence .",

    ", there are seven terms ( class @xmath131 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) due to non - linear terms in the expansion of the ccsd wavefunctions .",
    "namely these @xmath131 diagrams provide the lowest - order approximation for the dressing scheme proposed here .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vsivthorder ] we explore the topological structure of the @xmath131 diagrams .",
    "all these diagrams come from various ways of lowest - order dressing of @xmath132 diagram , eq .  .",
    "a comparison shows that the present dressing approach recovers five ( three line - dressed and two rpa - dressed ) out of seven ivth - order diagrams .",
    "the missing diagrams are shown in the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ fig : vsivthorder ] , and we call them `` stretched '' and `` ladder '' diagrams , the names being derived from the structure of the highlighted dressing insertions . while the ladder diagram comes from the untreated two - body contribution to @xmath0 object , eq .  , the stretched diagram involves more complex _ three_-body contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "dressing with these two insertions can be carried out in a way similar to the line- and rpa - like dressing schemes discussed in this paper and is beyond the scope of the present analysis .",
    "derived in ref .",
    "@xcite . in these diagrams",
    "horizonal lines denote coulomb interaction and the topological objects coming from the lowest - order approximation to @xmath0 are highlighted .",
    "the upper three diagrams arise in the leading order of the line - dressing scheme and two diagrams in the middle are related to the rpa - dressing scheme .",
    "[ fig : vsivthorder ] ]    we verified that in the lowest - order mbpt approximation , eq .  , our dressing formulae reproduce the pertinent ivth - order expressions , explicitly presented in ref .  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in table  [ tab : cshfsiv ] we list numerical values for individual contributions to magnetic - dipole hyperfine structure constant ( hfs ) @xmath133 for ground state of @xmath134cs and e1 transition amplitude for the principal @xmath135 transition in cs . analyzing this table we conclude that both line and rpa  like dressing are equally important .",
    "moreover , for these two particular matrix elements there is a partial cancelation between the line and rpa dressed diagrams , so that were one of the dressings omitted , the result would be misleading .",
    "we also observe that the untreated `` ladder '' diagram contributes a negligibly small fraction of the total . at the same time",
