    "brownian particle dynamics plays a key role for many transport processes in various disciplines . even though a century has passed since the publication of einstein s seminal work on _ normal diffusion _",
    "@xcite , the field of diffusion processes still attracts enormous interest @xcite .",
    "the essential signature of normal diffusion is the linear temporal growth of the mean square displacement of brownian particles , @xmath0 with @xmath1 , whereas for @xmath2 the notion _ anomalous diffusion _ has been introduced @xcite .",
    "being not only of fundamental but also of great technological relevance , the dynamical processes underlying anomalous diffusion phenomena have started to be investigated during recent decades in systems as diverse as collective ordering phenomena @xcite , particle diffusion in mesoscopic systems @xcite , or social networks @xcite . at the same time , progress in single particle manipulation and detection on the @xmath3 m and sub-@xmath3 m scale fostered investigations on random particle motions @xcite .",
    "diffusion processes with an exponent @xmath4 in ( [ msq ] ) are called _",
    "subdiffusive_. several examples of such dynamic behavior are known for systems with a short inhomogeneity length scale , such as in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , groundwater motion @xcite , diffusion in gels @xcite , and in several biological systems such as in the bacterial cytoplasm @xcite , during protein diffusion through cell membranes @xcite , or as a possible method to detect the microstructures in actin filament networks @xcite .",
    "besides subdiffusive motion , heterogeneous parameter landscapes are considered to be important also in generalized reaction - diffusion systems and for bifurcations in pattern forming systems in general @xcite .",
    "conversely , _",
    "superdiffusive _ processes are random motions with an exponent @xmath5 , which are found in rather different areas of natural and social sciences .",
    "superdiffusion tends to occur in active and driven systems where random steps are interrupted by intermediate and nearly deterministic motion , such as for particles in ( turbulent ) random velocity fields @xcite , during cell migration @xcite , for active transport in cells @xcite , or during the spread of diseases @xcite .",
    "another class of brownian motion that attracted remarkable interest recently is described by a nonlinear langevin equation with a velocity dependent viscous damping coefficient which is used as a model for active and relativistic motion @xcite as well as in the context of ratchet models @xcite .    here",
    ", we investigate the effects of inhomogeneous viscosities on the one - dimensional dynamics of brownian particles , considering viscosity variations , which are slow on the scale of the particles random steps . in this case",
    ", the interplay of a diffusing particle with its inhomogeneous surrounding leads to intermediate regimes of anomalous diffusion , similar to the intermediate rouse regime of diffusion of polymer segments @xcite . near a viscosity minimum we find subdiffusion , whereas superdiffusive behavior is found near a viscosity maximum and for monotonously varying viscosity profiles . in all three cases",
    "the particles probability distribution is found to be non - gaussian .",
    "our analysis is based on a nonlinear langevin equation and the appendant fokker - planck equation , which are presented in section  [ sec : model ] together with the spatially varying model viscosities considered in this work . in section [ scaleresults ]",
    "we calculate scaling formulas for the mean square displacement and analytical solutions of the fokker - planck equation for several limiting cases .",

    "in the overdamped limit , i.  e. for times longer than the characteristic time @xmath18 , a langevin equation for the particle s position can be derived from ( [ basicequation ] ) by using the method of adiabatic elimination @xcite . in ito s",

    "the brownian dynamics of an ensemble of test particles is investigated on the basis of ( [ basicequation ] ) , ( [ xprop ] ) and ( [ fpg ] ) with their initial positions at @xmath23 .",
    "spatially varying viscosities may be realized with organic gradient materials , where for instance the composition or the degree of polymerization changes in space @xcite . in photorheological fluids , as another example , the viscosity can be tuned by a spatially varying illumination intensity @xcite .",
    "a further class with the possibility of inhomogeneous viscosities are binary - fluid mixtures . here",
    "spatial variations of the concentration of the two constituents may be driven by temperature modulations via the soret effect @xcite . if both constituents have sufficiently different viscosities the thermally induced concentration variations are accompanied by spatial viscosity changes . for materials with a strong soret effect , quantified by the soret coefficient @xmath24 , small temperature gradients are sufficient to generate large concentration and therefore large viscosity gradients , so that the direct effects of temperature gradients can be neglected .",
    "suchlike experimentally favorable large values of @xmath24 can be achieved by shifting the mean temperature of the binary fluid in the one - phase region close to the critical temperature of the mixture , where a transition to the two - phase region takes place @xcite .    for the materials mentioned above",

    "the range , where the viscosity can reasonably be approximated by a power - law , increases with rising values of the ratio @xmath49 .",
    "for symmetric viscosity profiles , @xmath57 , we present a scaling analysis for the power law of the mean square displacement @xmath58 and in limiting cases exact solutions of the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpg ] ) . for asymmetric profiles we use a perturbation series to gain the time evolution of the first moments .",
    "the mean square displacement of a particle @xmath59 is commonly used to characterize its random motion . for a constant viscosity , the analytical solution of equation ( [ basicequation ] ) takes the well - known form @xcite : @xmath60 . beyond a short period of ballistic motion in the regime of normal diffusion , @xmath61 ,",
    "the mean square displacement increases linearly in time : @xmath62 in order to achieve progress by analytical calculations also for spatially varying and symmetric viscosity profiles @xmath63 , we use ( [ msqclassic ] ) with the replacement @xmath64 and simultaneously the substitution @xmath65 .",

    "further , the onset of anomalous diffusion is governed by the ratio @xmath115 : the larger this ratio the sooner the transition to anomalous diffusion takes place .",
    "asymmetric viscosity profiles lead to a mean particle drift towards the region with lower viscosity as indicated by ( [ mean_asym ] ) .",
    "it is also a remarkable property of each of the three moments that the sign of the leading contributions does not alternate .",
    "the results of the previous section are substantiated in the following by comparisons with numerical simulations of the langevin equation  ( [ basicequation ] ) and the fokker - planck equation  ( [ fpg ] ) for different spatially varying viscosities .",
    "the fokker - planck equation  ( [ fpg ] ) with a spatially varying damping is derived from ( [ basicequation ] ) under the assumption @xmath61 @xcite . for the symmetric viscosity @xmath116 with the minimal value @xmath117 and two different slopes @xmath118 and @xmath119 , the distribution @xmath120 is determined in figure  [ distributef ] at the time @xmath121 by solving either the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpg ] ) ( black solid curve ) or by integrating the langevin equation ( [ basicequation ] ) for an ensemble of @xmath122 particles ( red step function ) .",
    "the inequality @xmath61 is not always fulfilled as good as in figure  [ distributef ] , but the solutions of ( [ fpg ] ) are also for shorter times and stronger variations of @xmath9 often in good agreement with the solutions of ( [ basicequation ] ) .    there is a further aspect to be drawn from the profiles of the probability distribution @xmath120 in the anomalous regime . after the short normal diffusion in regime i",
    ", @xmath120 at @xmath123 deviates in regime ii from a gaussian profile as shown in figure  [ sub_super_density ] . in part",
    "( a ) the red curve of @xmath120 is determined numerically by solving ( [ fpg ] ) for the spatially varying viscosity @xmath124 with a small minimal viscosity @xmath125 .",
    "it is compared with the analytical solution of the fokker - planck equation in ( [ fpanalytic ] ) for @xmath126 ( blue dashed line ) and we find a nearly perfect agreement between both approaches in figure  [ sub_super_density ] .",
    "deviations grow by increasing the viscosity minimum @xmath29 in our simulations .",
    "both curves in figure  [ sub_super_density](a ) deviate , however , significantly from a gaussian distribution ( green dotted line ) with the same second moment .",
    "as predicted in section [ fpe_analytic_solution ] the distribution is platykurtic for @xmath77 , which can be explained as follows .",
    "due to the small minimal viscosity @xmath29 at the starting point at @xmath25 , particles quickly diffuse away .",
    "this reduces the probability to find a particle at @xmath25 and simultaneously enhances @xmath120 in a wider neighborhood of the minimum of @xmath127 , compared to the case of a constant damping with a gaussian distribution . on the other hand , a viscosity increasing strongly as a function of @xmath45 impedes quick particle diffusion away from the minimum",
    "this reduces the probability to find a particle at larger distances compared to a gaussian distribution .    with a viscosity maximum at the starting point of the particles the situation is similar , as illustrated by the distribution in figure  [ sub_super_density](b ) . here",
    "the numerical solution @xmath120 of the fokker - planck equation ( red curve ) is obtained for the viscosity @xmath128 and is compared with the analytical solution given by ( [ fpanalytic ] ) for @xmath129 ( blue dashed curve ) . only in the vicinity of the viscosity maximum at @xmath25",
    "both approaches differ slightly .",
    "again we find clear deviations from a gaussian distribution with an identical second moment as described by the green dotted curve in figure  [ sub_super_density](b ) . since the brownian dynamics is significantly reduced near the maximum of the damping at @xmath25 , the particles move much slower away from the peak .",
    "this causes an enhancement of @xmath120 around the maximum , compared to a gaussian distribution .",
    "thus the distribution is leptokurtic , in accordance with our predictions in section [ fpe_analytic_solution ] .    for a further analysis of the brownian motion the mean square displacement @xmath130 of the particle positions",
    "is calculated by integrating the langevin equation ( [ basicequation ] ) numerically for an ensemble of particles starting at @xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ timescale ] exemplarily shows @xmath131 as a function of time for two different spatially varying viscosities . in each case and independent from the particular viscosity landscape , the mean square displacement is characterized by the initial regime i of normal diffusion , marked by the dotted lines .    beyond this regime",
    "i , anomalous diffusion occurs with exponents @xmath132 , as long as the viscosity , experienced by the particles , does not reach a non - vanishing constant plateau value , as for instance for large @xmath45 in ( [ viscb ] ) . in the vicinity of a viscosity minimum , subdiffusive",
    "brownian motion with exponents @xmath133 is found , as exemplified in figure [ timescale](a ) for @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath134 . at long times the mean square displacement @xmath135 scales in the range of the dashed line with @xmath136 and @xmath137 , in good agreement with",
    "the scaling result @xmath138 predicted by formula ( [ msd_anomal ] ) with @xmath139 .",
    "the viscosity used in figure  [ timescale](b ) has in a small range @xmath140 a constant maximum , @xmath141 , and then decays in the range @xmath142 according to the power law @xmath143 .",
    "a fit to the numerical data in the limit of long times yields in the range of the dashed line in figure  [ timescale](b ) the exponent @xmath144 , deviating only slightly from the scaling prediction @xmath145 obtained from ( [ msd_anomal ] ) for @xmath146 .",
    "the deviations between the exponent obtained in simulations and the exponent obtained via scaling arguments decrease at sufficiently long times either by reducing the minimal viscosity @xmath29 as in figure  [ timescale](a ) or by shortening the plateau in figure  [ timescale](b ) .",
    "the scaling regimes i ( normal diffusion ) and ii ( anomalous diffusion ) are separated by a transition period , where the crossover from @xmath147 to @xmath148 takes place . this transition period may extend over several decades in time as for instance in figure  [ timescale](a ) with @xmath149 . together with an exponent @xmath139 this causes a transition period lasting over more than three decades .",

    "we find a good agreement in both generic cases : for subdiffusion ( @xmath133 ) with a minimum of @xmath153 and for superdiffusion ( @xmath154 ) with a maximum of @xmath9 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     for a further examination of the scaling prediction in the anomalous regime ii",
    ", different spatially varying viscosities were investigated numerically and in terms of the analytical scaling argument given by ( [ msd_anomal ] ) . as can be seen in table  1 ,",
    "the numerically and analytically obtained exponents @xmath84 are in excellent agreement for several viscosities . in general , in the neighborhood of a viscosity minimum one obtains subdiffusive behavior , whereas in the vicinity of a viscosity maximum superdiffusive behavior is observed . for the viscosities in table  1 with a small value @xmath29 at the minimum or a large value at the viscosity maximum",
    "one finds according to ( [ charact_times_1 ] ) and ( [ charact_times_2 ] ) an early onset of the intermediate anomalous regime ii .",
    "we would like to emphasize , that the viscosities discussed up to now are approximations of ( [ viscb ] ) , which we used to demonstrate the good agreement between our scaling results and numerical simulations in the anomalous regime ii .",
    "for the viscosity ( [ viscb ] ) regime ii is also limited in time from above as described in the previous section by the characteristic times given in ( [ charact_times_1 ] ) and ( [ charact_times_2 ] ) .    to investigate the crossover behavior between regime i and ii , the langevin and the fokker - planck equation were solved for the viscosity @xmath155 up to the fixed time @xmath156 and for different values of @xmath29 and @xmath157 . with this approach",
    "we mimic the limited time range available in experiments for detecting the anomalous regime .",
    "the numerical curves of the mean square displacement @xmath130 are fitted over the whole range @xmath158 by the power law @xmath136 and the resulting exponent @xmath84 is shown in figure  [ exp1 ] as function of the viscosity .",
    "the deviation of @xmath84 from @xmath1 grows , when the anomalous diffusion regime ii occupies an increasing part of the interval @xmath159 $ ] , i. e. when the inequality @xmath160 holds for an increasing part of @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "the two terms @xmath161 and @xmath162 in the denominator of ( [ msq_approx ] ) become nearly equal at the time @xmath163 .",
    "hence , for decreasing values of @xmath164 the range of anomalous diffusion in @xmath159 $ ] increases as illustrated by the trend in figure  [ exp1](a ) .",
    "on the other hand , the anomalous fraction and therefore @xmath84 can be kept constant by keeping @xmath165 constant , which is shown by figure  [ exp1](b ) .    the behavior of @xmath84 in figure  [ exp1 ] can also be derived via ( [ msq_approx ] ) by using @xmath166 .",

    "its average @xmath170 corresponds to the dashed lines in figure  [ exp1 ] , which agree surprisingly well with the full numerical results obtained by ( [ fpg ] ) .",
    "we find visible deviations from the full solution only if the viscosity shows very small values close to zero either at the minimum or for @xmath171 , which , however , is unlikely in experiments .",
    "therefore , the exponent obtained via the scaling relation ( [ msq_approx ] ) may be useful in analyzing and fitting experimental results .",
    "a further experimental relevant model viscosity is described by the asymmetric function ( [ visctanh ] ) , which may be approximated in the range @xmath172 by the linear dependence in equation ( [ visca ] ) .",
    "the essential qualitative difference to the previous model viscosities is its asymmetry with respect to the starting point of the particles at @xmath25 , which causes non - vanishing moments @xmath173 and @xmath174 as given in ( [ mean_asym ] ) and ( [ third_asym ] ) for short time intervals .",
    "the quality of the approximate solutions in ( [ mean_asym])-([third_asym ] ) is investigated in figure  [ anadrift ] , where in part ( a ) the leading contribution to the drift of the mean value in ( [ mean_asym ] ) ( dashed lines ) is compared to the first moment of the numerical solution of ( [ fpg ] ) ( solid lines ) . despite the finding that the differences between both approaches increase with @xmath175 , the results are still in good agreement since the deviations do not exceed @xmath176 for @xmath177 and @xmath178 for @xmath179 , even at @xmath180 .",
    "[ htb ]    the diffusion in an asymmetric viscosity profile ( [ visca ] ) becomes anomalous too , as indicated by the contributions @xmath181 and @xmath182 to the approximate second moment in equation ( [ msd_asym ] ) .",

    "we point out , that anomalous diffusion still persists , when the drift of @xmath173 is subtracted from the particle dynamics as illustrated by the following formula : @xmath184 . with the help of the third moment ( [ third_asym ] )",
    "one can also define the skewness @xmath185 of a probability distribution @xcite , which is given in our case at the leading order by @xmath186 .",
    "since @xmath185 is negative for @xmath187 , the left tail of the probability distribution becomes more important .",
    "all three aspects , the non - vanishing drift , the skewness of the particle distribution and the anomalous diffusion caused by an asymmetric monotonous viscosity profile are recaptured in numerical solutions of the langevin equation ( [ basicequation ] ) and the fokker - planck equation ( [ fpg ] ) by integrating both for the viscosity ( [ visctanh ] ) up to time scales beyond the validity range of equations ( [ mean_asym])-([third_asym ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution is shown in figure  [ flinvis](a ) for increasing values of @xmath188 , where the left tail is the more important one as predicted by the skewness @xmath185 of the distribution introduced above .",
    "the time dependence of the mean square displacement @xmath130 is shown for the viscosity ( [ visctanh ] ) by the inset in figure [ flinvis](b ) for @xmath189 , @xmath117 and @xmath190 and illustrates all three temporal diffusion regimes . during the early temporal regime i with @xmath27 and in the long time limit with @xmath44 ( regime iii ) one has normal diffusion with the exponent @xmath1 as indicated by the dotted lines in the inset of [ flinvis](b ) .",

    "the exponent @xmath84 may take even larger values in the limit @xmath198 .",
    "the mean value @xmath173 drifts also for the viscosity profile ( [ visctanh ] ) . for small values of @xmath199 and @xmath48",
    "we find a perfect agreement with the linear time dependence given by the leading contribution in ( [ msd_asym ] ) , but its dependence becomes more complex in the range of larger values of @xmath188 and in the long - time limit .",
    "we have identified three different diffusion regimes for mesoscopic brownian particles in spatially varying viscosities , which were analyzed by three approaches : firstly , by scaling arguments applied to the expression of the mean square displacement , secondly by simulations of the corresponding nonlinear langevin equation  ( [ basicequation ] ) , and thirdly by solving the related fokker - planck equation  ( [ fpg ] ) either numerically or , in limiting cases , even analytically . for an ensemble of particles starting at a viscosity extremum a short regime of normal diffusion is found where the mean square displacement @xmath58 scales with the exponent @xmath1 . beyond this regime",
    "brownian particles experience considerable changes of the viscosity along their trajectories , which leads to anomalous diffusive motion in an intermediate temporal regime . near a minimum of the viscosity",
    "the particle dynamics becomes subdiffusive with an exponent @xmath200 , whereas it becomes superdiffusive with @xmath154 in the vicinity of viscosity maxima . in the long time",
    "limit , when the brownian particles explore the whole range of a viscosity variation , as for instance described by ( [ viscb ] ) or for a periodically varying viscosity , the particles experience a mean viscosity and therefore normal diffusion is found .    in the intermediate anomalous diffusive regime",
    "the particles probability distribution is non - gaussian . in the case of a viscosity minimum the particle distribution function",
    "is - compared to a gaussian with the same second moment - reduced at its maximum , increased at intermediate distances from its maximum , and reduced again at large distances .",
    "the opposite happens near a maximum of the viscosity : the particle distribution function is enhanced at the starting point of the particles and reduced at intermediate distances from the initial position . for an ensemble of particles starting in the range of a linearly varying viscosity profile , which is asymmetric with respect to the starting point , one finds an asymmetric particle distribution reflecting itself in a non - vanishing skewness .",
    "in addition , the first moment of the distribution drifts as function of time into the direction of decreasing viscosity and the particles show superdiffusive behavior .",
    "however , superdiffusivity is only partly caused by the particle drift : the exponent of the superdiffusive motion reduces only slightly towards 1 when the mean drift is subtracted from the particle motion but still shows clearly superdiffusive behavior with @xmath80 .",
    "the subdiffusive behavior in an intermediate regime in the neighborhood of a minimum of the particle damping shares similarities with the brownian dynamics of a single segment of a flexible polymer , the so - called rouse dynamics . also in this case one has normal diffusion of the segments on a short as well as on a long time scale . in the intermediate range , where the mean square displacement of the segment is of the order of the polymer - coil diameter",
    ", one finds the subdiffusive behavior @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to most of the well - known examples showing anomalous diffusion , one can imagine for systems suggested in this work both types of anomalous diffusion , sub- and superdiffusion .",
    "in photorheological materials @xcite , for example , either a maximum or a minimum of the viscosity as well as monotonously varying viscosities can be induced by an appropriate spatial variation of the illumination strength . in some binary mixtures the sign of the soret effect changes as a function of the mean temperature of the mixture @xcite .",
    "the two possible signs may be used to attract either the lower viscous component to the locally heated area or the higher viscous component . in glass forming polymer - mixtures the relation between the local composition and the viscosity can be a nonlinear function @xcite .",
    "materials with strong variations of the local viscosity are especially favorable to observe anomalous diffusion , as discussed in this work .",
    "another interesting subject are heated particles in a binary fluid mixture , undergoing brownian motion .",
    "an example are light absorbing particles in a transparent binary fluid - mixture with an upper miscibility gap such as for instance @xmath107-butoxyethanol and water @xcite , where the temperature may be driven close to the transition temperature . the inhomogeneous temperature field around a particle sets in much faster than related changes of the concentration and the viscosity in the neighborhood of the particle , such that the brownian particle experiences temporally its own induced viscosity variations .",
    "the delayed dynamics between temperature and viscosity field may lead to interesting memory effects that are also prone to cause anomalous diffusion and will be investigated in forthcoming work .",
    "this work was started during a summer project for undergraduate students and was supported by the german science foundation via the research unit for608 , the research center sfb 481 and the priority program on micro- and nanofluidics spp 1164 .",
    "we thank j. bammert , d. kienle , w. pesch , and s. schreiber for useful discussions ."
