    ", the fock state of a meson is represented as an infinite expansion of different quark and gluon configurations , but in a hybrid meson , the @xmath3 component dominates .",

    "a quark - antiquark pair couples directly to the vibrational degrees of freedom of the gluonic fluxtube .",

    "compass @xcite is well positioned to collect significantly cleaner data , and at lower cost , and using complementary methods , compared to the other planned efforts .",
    "the primakoff production of hybrids in compass is part of a more global primakoff physics program , involving studies of pion and kaon polarizabilities , and studies of the chiral anomaly @xcite .",
    "the compass hybrid meson searches @xcite will focus on ` oddballs'mesons with quantum numbers not allowed for ordinary @xmath5 states , such as @xmath6 hybrids . unlike glueballs , these can not mix with normal @xmath5 mesons .",
    "however , since such oddballs could also be four - quark states , the spin assignment is not sufficient to make the hybrid identification @xcite . in certain cases ,",
    "there are other theoretical interpretations @xcite for such experimental signals .",
    "previous experimental efforts have reported several 1@xmath7 resonant signals @xcite at masses between 1.4 and 1.9 gev , in a variety of decay channels , including the @xmath8 channel .",
    "the signature for such an exotic state is that a detailed partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of a large data sample requires a set of quantum numbers inconsistent with a normal ( @xmath9 ) meson . to increase confidence in a hybrid interpretation",
    ", complementary evidence is sorely needed .",
    "the path to understanding requires that different experiments , such as the important input from compass primakoff studies , provide a large database of candidate hybrid states , and their properties .",
    "barnes and isgur , using the flux - tube model @xcite , calculated the mass of the lightest pionic hybrid with quantum numbers of @xmath10 to be around 1.9 gev , higher than the experimental claims .",
    "close and page predict that such a high - lying pionic hybrid should decay into the following channels :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     where the numbers refer to the partial widths in mev . they expect the total width to be larger than 235 - 270 mev , since the @xmath11 decay modes were not included .",
    "recent updates on hybrid meson structure are given in refs .",
    "the lower lying hybrids of recent experiments have significantly different branching ratios .",
    "this may reflect that the structure of these experimental low - mass hybrids is different than that of the theoretical high - mass hybrids , and considering the high thresholds of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 decay channels for decay of a low - mass hybrid .    from over a decade of experimental efforts at ihep @xcite , cern @xcite , kek @xcite , and bnl @xcite ,",
    "several hybrid candidates have been identified .",
    "bnl e852 @xcite reported two @xmath14 resonant signals at masses of 1.4 and 1.6 gev in @xmath15 and @xmath16 systems , as well as in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the ves collaboration presented @xcite the results of a coupled - channel analysis of the @xmath21 meson in the channels @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath8 , with a total width of 290 mev , and relative branching ratios : @xmath24 .",
    "they did not include the @xmath25 channel in this analysis .",
    "the resonant nature of the 1.6 gev state was observed in the @xmath26 mode , by a combined fit of the 2@xmath27 and 1@xmath7 waves .",
    "then an assumption was made that in the @xmath28 and @xmath29 channels , they observed the same state , considering the similar shapes .",
    "therefore , their coupled channel analysis result of a @xmath30 partial width of 130 mev , and a total width of 290 mev , should be taken with some caution , considering also that the @xmath25 channel is not included .",
    "still , for the 1.6 gev region , the ves @xmath30 partial width is consistent with the bnl @xmath29 width of 168 mev . for count rate estimates below , we will use an average value of 150 mev for the @xmath30 width at 1.6 gev .",
    "the kinematic variables for the @xmath31 primakoff process in compass are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "a virtual photon from the coulomb field of the target nucleus interacts with the pion beam . at 200 gev",
    "@xmath32 beam energy , nuclear ( meson - exchange ) amplitudes in the primakoff production of the @xmath33 meson were shown to be very small @xcite in the kinematic region of primakoff production .",
    "this is very encouraging for the compass studies .",
    "still , compass can carry out data analysis of hybrid data with and without meson - exchange amplitudes , to test to what extent their presence effects the extraction of the primakoff cross section .",
    "for a given hybrid ( @xmath34 ) partial decay width @xmath35 ) , vector dominance model ( vdm ) gives an associated radiative width @xmath36 ) @xcite . as the primakoff cross section is proportional to @xmath37 ) @xcite , all hybrids that decay to the @xmath38 channel should also be produced in the primakoff reaction .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath21 , the @xmath39 1@xmath7 state should be only weakly populated in the primakoff reaction , as it has a very small @xmath40 partial decay width . for the @xmath34(1600 ) radiative width , we use the standard vdm expression @xcite with a @xmath41 coupling @xmath42 , which correctly relates the corresponding widths for the @xmath33 meson decay . we obtain @xmath43 , which gives the vdm estimate @xmath44 .    in fig .",
    "1 , a hybrid meson ( other than @xmath39 ) is produced and decays to @xmath45 at small forward angles in the laboratory frame , while the target nucleus ( in the ground state ) recoils coherently with a small transverse p@xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding small p@xmath46 of the exchanged photon means that it is essentially real and transverse .",
    "consequently , the helicities of incident and primakoff produced mesons differ by unity .",
    "the peak at small target @xmath47 used to identify @xcite the primakoff process is observed by using the beam and vertex and other compass detectors to measure the beam pion and final state hybrid momenta .",
    "primakoff scattering is a large impact - parameter , ultra - peripheral reaction on a virtual photon target .",

    "= for initial / final pion , p2 , p2@xmath48 = for initial / final target , k = for initial @xmath49 , k@xmath48 = for final @xmath50.,width=264 ]    it is important to note that in addition to primakoff production of excited meson states , one also expects diffractive production .",
    "it is necessary to separate the primakoff forward peak from these underlying sometimes large diffractive yields @xcite .",
    "the strength of the diffractive cross section depends on angular momentum conservation at zero degrees ; and therefore on which decay mode is studied : @xmath26 , @xmath51 , @xmath8 , @xmath52 , @xmath23 .",
    "the potentially large diffractively produced waves with spin projection m=0 and j@xmath53 can complicate the pwa of @xmath8 , but not @xmath54 . of course",
    ", although the @xmath54 channel may be cleaner , it may not necessarily have a large 1@xmath1 hybrid contribution .",
    "the t - distribution of the diffractive yield depends on whether there is helicity flip at zero degrees .",
    "the t - dependence of these dominant ( no helicity - flip ) diffractive waves is exp(-bt ) .",
    "the accuracy with which one can subtract this background depends on the fraction of the projective helicity - flip ( @xmath55 ) diffractive waves associated with 2@xmath56 states , which have a t - dependence @xmath57 .",
    "all the waves have phases and can interfere , so that subtracting only an exponential would ignore these effects .",
    "however , as the coulomb waves have gottfried - jackson helicity @xmath55 , while strong production occurs dominantly with m=0 , the interference should be zero to lowest order @xcite .",
    "such subtraction was done , even for a large diffractive cross section @xcite , as in the recent measurement of the radiative decay width of the a2(1320 ) meson @xcite via its decay to the @xmath58 channel .",
    "the subtraction was done by extrapolation of the data away from the forward primakoff peak , assuming an exp(-bt ) dependence of the diffractive yields .",
    "such theoretical assumptions on the t - dependence of the background should have small effect on narrow resonances ( 104 mev width ) such as the a@xmath59 .",
    "this appears to be the case , considering the consistency of the a@xmath59 radiative widths determined via primakoff production , and then decay via the @xmath40 and @xmath60 channels @xcite .",
    "but an exponential subtraction may cause larger uncertainties for hybrids with large ( 300 - 500 mev ) widths .",
    "the hybrid data analysis therefore should test the sensitivity of the results to such exponential background assumptions .",
    "in the recent primakoff study of the a@xmath59 radiative width by decay to @xmath58 , following subtraction of the diffractive yield , due in part to poor statistics , the resulting primakoff mass spectrum does not show significant structure above the clearly observed a@xmath59(1320 ) .",
    "also , for this high mass region , a pwa is not available .",
    "considering the subtraction and statistical uncertainties discussed above , this does not rule out that the @xmath58 width is nonetheless large in the region of the expected 1.6 gev hybrid . and with improved statistics and resolution and acceptance , and by studying all decay modes in the same experiment , compass",
    "can potentially do a significantly better hybrid analysis .",
    "high lying excited meson states certainly couple to the @xmath58 channel , as shown clearly in the work of photoproduction of excited mesons , observed by their @xmath58 decay mode @xcite .",
    "consider some typical angular distributions from primakoff scattering , such as those for the @xmath61 scattering , for different values of @xmath52 invariant mass .",
    "if these are associated with the production and decay of a @xmath62 @xmath63 hybrid state , with quantum numbers not available to @xmath5 mesons , then a detailed partial wave analysis ( pwa ) of a large data sample would indicate the need for these quantum numbers .",
    "the partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) of systems such as @xmath52 or @xmath28 in the mass region below 2 gev requires high statistics and minimum background .",
    "this region is dominated by strong resonances ( e.g. , @xmath64(1320 ) near the 1.4 gev hybrid candidate and @xmath65(1670 ) near the 1.6 gev hybrid candidate ) , and the pwa can yield ambiguous results @xcite for the weaker @xmath66 wave . for the primakoff yield , following subtraction of the diffractive yield , the cross section for 1.6 gev hybrid production ( @xmath34 ) , in all decay channels , should be larger than the background .",
    "this is so because @xmath67  ke@xmath68v , smaller than the expected @xmath69  ke@xmath68v .",
    "in contrast , the bnl experiment @xcite for this decay channel has a background from @xmath65(1670 ) some 10 times stronger than the hybrid signal .",
    "primakoff data with reduced backgrounds should significantly diminish uncertainties in the partial wave analysis compared to the non - primakoff production experiments .",
    "it might allow the hybrid to be observed in the mass spectrum in some of the decay modes , not only via pwa .",
    "furthermore , in primakoff ( photon - exchange ) production experiments , besides the absence of final state interactions , meson - exchange and diffractive backgrounds can be largely eliminated .",
    "most of these backgrounds occur at larger values of the four - momentum transfer t , and are easily removed by an analysis cut on the t - value .",
    "the part of these backgrounds that extends to small - t can be largely removed by extrapolation to small - t of the large - t data .",
    "these are important advantages compared to previous @xmath70 production experiments @xcite .",
    "preliminary low statistics hybrid production data @xcite at fermilab e272 via primakoff scattering provide encouraging initial results for production of a 1.6 gev 1@xmath7 hybrid .",
    "the data for decay to the @xmath71 channel shows signs of primakoff enhancement ( excess of 25 events ) at small - t .",
    "this gives @xmath72 .",
    "if b(@xmath73 , that corresponds to @xmath74 , close to the value deduced using vdm with a 150 mev partial width in the @xmath40 channel .",
    "for @xmath58 decay of a 1.6 gev state , fnal e272 had insufficient statistics to separate a coulomb enhancement from the diffractive background .",
    "as their data was for the combined spectra , their estimate of the upper limit to the primakoff hybrid yield has large uncertainties .",
    "fnal selex measured the a@xmath59 radiative decay via the @xmath40 mode .",
    "the selex primakoff spectrum , after subtraction of diffractive background , shows the a@xmath59 peak clearly .",
    "the e272 @xmath58 data for diffractive plus primakoff production does not even show the a@xmath59 peak .",
    "it is difficult to use e272 data to get primakoff limits in the @xmath58 channel near 1.6 gev . for a 150 mev @xmath58 partial width of a 1.6 gev hybrid ,",
    "the e272 data gives an upper limit for @xmath75 close to 100 kev .",
    "since this limit value has a huge error bar , the e272 estimate using the cleaner @xmath71 data is certainly more reliable .",
    "e272 also shows via the @xmath76 decay mode , that @xmath77 is at most 100 kev for a @xmath321 near 1.6 gev , for a @xmath321 with a total width of 400 mev .",
    "but the @xmath321 branching b(@xmath78 ) from ves and bnl is very small , so this is still consistent with @xmath79 near 1000 kev .",
    "consequently , one may estimate from the e272 @xmath71 data that @xmath75 is close to 1000 kev .",
    "this is consistent with @xmath80 , which we obtain by applying vdm to the experimental @xmath81 width , as described above .",
    "one can summarize the situation as follows . for primakoff scattering ,",
    "hybrid - meson production cross section depends on the strength of its @xmath58 coupling , and via vector dominance to its @xmath82 coupling .",
    "both bnl and ves claim this decay mode for the 1.6 gev hybrid candidate . a low statistics @xmath83 meson photoproduction experiment @xcite also observed resonances ( including near 1.9 gev ) in the @xmath40 channel , suggesting possible hybrid interpretations . based on previous data from fnal e272 and ves , we estimate @xmath74 for a 1.6 gev hybrid .",
    "the relevant primakoff reactions @xmath84 @xmath85 , etc .",
    ", can therefore be studied in compass potentially in the 1.4 - 3.0 gev mass region , which includes all previous hybrid candidates .",
    "the quark content of the hybrid meson ( @xmath86 ) nonet should be identical to the quark content of the regular meson ( @xmath9 ) nonet , with identical su(3 ) decomposition in the plane of isospin i@xmath87 and hypercharge y , for the 1@xmath88 and other spin - parity states .",
    "thus , for every pionic @xmath89 1@xmath7 hybrid , there should be a flavor excited kaonic @xmath90 1@xmath88 hybrid , at an excitation energy roughly 100 - 140 mev higher than its pionic hybrid cousin , possibly narrower because of phase space .",
    "compass can observe the kaonic hybrids via @xmath91 z , as well as other decay modes : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "the backgrounds should be low from primakoff excitation of normal kaonic excited mesons , as in the case of the pionic hybrids ; and also if the kaonic hybrids are narrower .",
    "the first ever measurement of the kaonic hybrids via primakoff scattering would be of inherent interest , but would also provide valuable support that the analogous pionic signals are properly identified as hybrids .",
    "searches for @xmath96 hybrids via @xmath97 hybrid have also been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "compass will also study primakoff radiative transitions leading from the pion to the @xmath98 , a@xmath99(1260 ) , and a@xmath59(1320 ) , and for the kaon to k@xmath100 .",
    "the data can be obtained with a particle - multiplicity trigger @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions for radiative transition widths are available from vector dominance and quark models .",
    "independent and higher precision data for these and higher resonances would provide a useful check of the compass apparatus , and would allow a more meaningful comparison with theoretical predictions .",
    "for example , the @xmath101 width measurements @xcite range from 60 to 81 kev ; the a@xmath99(1260 ) @xmath102 width measurement @xcite is @xmath103 mev ; and the a@xmath59(1320 ) @xmath102 width is is @xmath104 60 kev @xcite and @xmath105 kev @xcite . for k@xmath106 ,",
    "the widths obtained previously are 48 @xmath107 11 kev @xcite and 51 @xmath107 5 kev @xcite .",
    "the above references indicate that the formalism of primakoff production provides an excellent description of excited mesons , the same formalism that we use to search for primkoff production of hybrids .",
    "these as well as polarizability and chiral anomaly @xcite primakoff measurements are important for a variety of reasons : ( 1 ) compass can significantly improve their precision , ( 2 ) compass can get data for other @xmath108 meson excited states , ( 3 ) these measurements with sufficient statistics test our methodologies and help calibrate our apparatus for the hybrid studies .",
    "compass is a fixed - target experiment that uses a 160 gev polarized muon beam , and pion , kaon , and proton beams . in order to achieve good energy resolution within a wide energy range",
    ", compass has a two - stage spectrometer with 1.0 tm and 5.2 tm conventional magnets .",
    "the tracking stations contain different detector types to cover a large area , and to achieve good spatial resolution in the vicinity of the beam .",
    "most of the tracking detectors operate on the principle of gas amplification , while some are silicon strip detectors . at the end of each stage , an electromagnetic and a hadronic calorimeter detects energies of photons , electrons and hadrons .",
    "the calorimeters in the first stage and the em calorimeter of the second stage have holes through which the beam passes .    in compass ,",
    "two beam cherenkov detectors ( cedar ) , far upstream of the target , provide @xmath109 particle identification ( pid ) .",
    "the incoming hadron momentum is measured in the beam spectrometer .",
    "before and after the target , charged particles are tracked by high resolution silicon tracking detectors .",
    "the measurement of both initial and final state momenta provides constraints to identify the reaction .",
    "the final - state meson momenta are measured downstream in the magnetic spectrometer and in the @xmath49 calorimeter .",
    "these provide a precise determination of the p@xmath46 transfer to the target nucleus , the main signature of the primakoff process , and the means to separate primakoff from meson - exchange scattering events .",
    "we considered in detail previously the beam , target , detector , and trigger requirements for hybrid studies @xcite .",
    "a brief description is given below of some important components of the apparatus for primakoff studies .",
    "2002 status of the full compass apparatus is described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we can obtain good statistics for the pion study by using the high beam intensities of the cern sps .",
    "we can take data at different beam energies and use different targets , with both positive and negative beams , as part of efforts to control systematic uncertainties .",
    "for the 120 - 300 gev hadron beams , particle identification ( pid ) is needed to provide pion , kaon , and proton beam tagging for positive and negative beams . for the compass beam ,",
    "one expects @xcite a beam intensity of 100 mhz , with beam composition @xcite roughly : 120 - 300 gev / c , negative , 87 - 98% pions , 7 - 1% kaons , 2%-1% antiprotons ; 120 - 300 gev / c , positive , 43 - 2% pions , 7 - 1% kaons , 49 - 97% protons .",
    "pid is accomplished at cern with the cedar detectors , cherenkov differential counter with achromatic ring focusing .",
    "there are two cedar detectors ( in series ) in the compass beamline @xcite .",
    "they each have eight large area pmts arranged in a circle , preceded by a single light diaphragm ( ld ) to finely fix a ring radius .",
    "a six - fold coincidence is required for the pid .",
    "the gas pressure is varied to set the ring radius for pions or kaons or protons at the ld location .",
    "the narrow diaphragm mounted in cedar - n separates kaons from pions up to 300 gev / c , and can tag protons down to 12 gev / c .",
    "the target platform is movable and allows easy insertion of a solid target , e.g. , a cylindrical lead plate 40 mm in diameter and 1.4 mm thick .",
    "we use silicon tracking detectors before and immediately after the targets .",
    "these are essential for primakoff reactions as the angles have to be measured with a precision of order 100 @xmath110rad .",
    "we veto target break - up events via a target recoil detector , and by selecting low - t events in the off - line analysis .",
    "the compass @xmath49 detector is equipped with 3.8 by 3.8 @xmath111 gams lead - glass for a total active area of order 2 m diameter .",
    "the central area is already completely instrumented with adc readouts . for the precise monitoring of energy calibration of the photon calorimeters , compass will use led and laser monitor systems , as described in ref .",
    "the position resolution in the second @xmath49 calorimeter ecal2 for the photon is 1.0 mm , corresponding to an angular resolution of 30 @xmath110rad . in the interesting energy range ,",
    "the energy resolution is 2 - 3% .",
    "the photon acceptance is 98% due to a beam hole of ecal2 , while the reconstruction efficiency is 58% , as a result of pair production within the spectrometer .",
    "as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] , compass requires reconstructed @xmath50s for the hybrid study .",
    "the two @xmath49s from @xmath50 decay have half - opening angles @xmath112 for the symmetric decays of @xmath113 , where m is the mass ( @xmath50 ) and e@xmath114 is the @xmath50 energy .",
    "( opening angles are somewhat larger for asymmetric decays . ) in order to catch most of the decays , it is necessary to subtend a cone with about double that angle , i.e. , @xmath115 , neglecting the angular spread of the original @xmath50s around the beam direction . for the ecal2 @xmath49 detector , with a circular active area of 2 m in diameter ,",
    "the acceptance for the @xmath54 channel at 30 m from the target for @xmath50s above e@xmath114=33 gev is therefore excellent . at half",
    "this energy , however , the acceptance becomes quite poor .",
    "the acceptance depends of course on the hybrid mass , which is taken between 1.4 and 3.0 gev for the planned compass study .",
    "detailed monte carlo studies are needed for different hybrid decay modes , for a range of assumed masses . for the @xmath32f@xmath99 channel , for example , @xmath116",
    ", the @xmath50s will have low energy , and therefore large @xmath49 angles . to maintain good acceptance for low energy @xmath50s",
    ", the ecal2 diameter should be about 2 m .",
    "the available compass ecal does not have radiation hardened blocks near the beam hole .",
    "if those will be available , it would allow increasing the beam intensity by a factor of five , to allow substantially more statistics for the same run time .",
    "this would clearly be a cost - effective improvement .",
    "the p@xmath46 impulses of the compass magnets are 0.3 gev / c for sm1 ( 4 meters from target ) and 1.56 gev / c for sm2 ( 16 meters from target ) .",
    "the fields of both magnets are set in the same direction for maximum deflection of the beam .",
    "we achieve good momentum resolution for the incident and final state charged and neutral mesons , and therefore good resolution in t. the relative momentum resolution for charged @xmath32 , with all interactions accounted for , is 1% for energies above 35 gev and up to 2.5% below this mark .",
    "the angular resolution in a single coordinate for a charged - pion of momentum p is 7.9 mrad - gev / p . the reconstruction efficiency for pions with energy greater than 2 gev is 92% .",
    "the angular resolution for a final - state charged meson is controlled by minimizing the multiple scattering in the targets and detectors . with a lead target of 0.8% interaction length ( 1.6 g/@xmath111 ,  24% radiation length ) , multiple coulomb scattering ( mcs ) of the beam and outgoing pion in the target gives an rms angular resolution of order 32@xmath110rad , small compared to the intrinsic tracking - detector angular resolution .",
    "the target contributes to the resolution in the transverse momentum p@xmath46 through mcs . for @xmath117 ,",
    "including all other effects @xcite , we aim for a p@xmath46 resolution of less than 15 mev , corresponding to @xmath118 smaller than @xmath119 2.5 @xmath120 gev@xmath121 .",
    "this resolution will provide good separation for contributions from diffractive and meson - exchange processes . minimum material ( radiation and interaction lengths ) in compass will also yield a higher acceptance , since the @xmath49 s will not be converted before the ecal2 , and the result is minimum @xmath122 backgrounds .",
    "we design @xcite the compass primakoff trigger to enhance the acceptance and statistics .",
    "we minimize target break - up events via veto scintillators around the target .",
    "the trigger uses the characteristic decay pattern : one or three charged mesons with accompanying @xmath49 hits , or three charged mesons and no @xmath49 hits .",
    "the trigger @xcite for the @xmath54 hybrid decay channel ( charged particle multiplicity = 1 ) is based on a determination of the pion energy loss ( via its characteristic angular deflection ) , correlated with downstream scintillator hodoscopes stations ( h1 versus h2 ) with the aid of a fast matrix chip , as shown in fig .",

    "compass can study pionic hybrid - meson candidates between near 1.4 - 1.9 gev , produced by the ultra - peripheral primakoff reaction . but compass may also be sensitive to pionic and kaonic hybrids for the 1.9 - 3.0 gev mass range , if they also couple to the @xmath40 and @xmath123 channels .",
    "we can then potentially obtain superior statistics for hybrid states via a production mechanism that is not complicated by hadronic final - state interactions .",
    "we can also get important data on the different decay modes in both pionic and kaonic channels .",
    "we make initial rough estimates of the statistics attainable for hybrid production in the compass experiment .",
    "monte carlo simulations will refine these estimates .",
    "we assume a 1.6 mb cross section per pb nucleus for production of a 1.6 gev hybrid meson .",
    "we use the radiative width of @xmath124 , as described above , and also for the 1.9 - 3.0 gev mass region .",
    "integrating the primakoff hybrid production differential cross section for a 280 gev pion beam , and using this radiative width , gives 1.6 mb @xcite .",
    "we consider a beam flux of @xmath125 pions / sec , with a spill structure that provides a 5 second beam every 16 seconds . in 2 months of running at 100% efficiency ,",
    "we obtain 3.2@xmath126 10@xmath127 beam pions .",
    "prior to the data production run , time is also needed to calibrate ecal2 , to make the tracking detectors operational , to bring the daq to a stable mode , and for other contingencies .",
    "we use a 0.8  % interaction length target , or 1.4 mm lead plate with target density @xmath128 .",
    "the primakoff interaction rate is then @xmath129 10@xmath130 . in a 2 month run period ,",
    "we therefore obtain 5.1@xmath126 10@xmath131 hybrid events at 100% efficiency .",
    "considering efficiencies for tracking ( 92% ) , @xmath49 detection ( 58% for each @xmath49 ) , accelerator and compass operation ( 70% ) , analysis cuts to reduce backgrounds ( 75% ) , branching ratio for the @xmath132 and @xmath133 decay modes ( @xmath134% ) , trigger efficiency ( @xmath135% ) , geometrical acceptances ( @xmath136% ) , @xmath137 and @xmath50 reconstruction from two @xmath49 hits ( @xmath138% ) , and event reconstruction efficiencies ( @xmath135% ) , we estimate a global efficiency of @xmath139(total)= 1.5% .",
    "we will assume here the same average detection efficiency for all hybrid decay modes , via @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , we can expect to observe a total of 7.7 @xmath141 hybrid decays in all decay channels for the 1.6 gev hybrid .",
    "for example , following theory and ves branching ratios , we expect for the 1.6 gev state , most data in the @xmath71 , @xmath40 , @xmath142 , and b@xmath143 channels .    for 2 , 2.5 , 3.0 gev mass hybrids , assuming that they have the same radiative width",
    ", the number of useful events decreases by factors of 6 , 25 , and 100 , respectively .",
    "but even in these cases , assuming again a global 1.5% efficiency , that would represent a very interesting potential of samples of 13@xmath12610@xmath144 , 3.1@xmath12610@xmath144 , and 0.77 @xmath145 hybrid meson detected events , with masses 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0 gev , respectively .",
    "taking into account the very high beam intensity , fast data acquisition , high acceptance and good resolution of the compass setup , one can expect from compass the highest statistics and a ` systematics - free ' data sample that includes many tests to control possible uncertainties .",
    "comparison between compass and past and new experiments @xcite , with complementary methodologies , should allow fast progress on understanding hybrid meson structure , their production and decay characteristics , and on establishing systematic uncertainties .",
