    "the study of the infrared behavior of non - abelian gauge theories , like quantum chromodynamics , presents a remarkable task for theoretical physics .",
    "the strongly - coupled nonperturbative nature of infrared phenomena greatly undermines our ability to access the physical properties of the theory in an analytical way .",
    "one general question raised in this context concerns the description of the degrees of freedom in a confining theory .",
    "confinement of the perturbative excitations associated with the fundamental fields means , among other features , that these degrees of freedom do not appear in the physical spectrum of the theory as asymptotic states .",
    "the physical spectrum in this case is given by bound states associated with composite fields of the theory .",
    "the fundamental problem is thus to understand how the perturbative degrees of freedom disappear from the spectrum and how this is reflected in an action formulation written in terms of them .",
    "a very important tool in identifying the physical space of states in a gauge theory is the brst symmetry @xcite . in a brst invariant theory ,",
    "the physical states are defined by the cohomology of the nilpotent brst operator that acts on the fundamental fields . however , this is strictly valid only at the perturbative level .",
    "in fact , the whole construction of the brst formalism in a gauge theory can be traced back to the faddeev - popov procedure of gauge fixing .",
    "since it has long been known that this procedure ceases to be valid at the nonperturbative level @xcite , there is no strict necessity to expect that the brst symmetry survives in the infrared regime .",
    "indeed , there is strong evidence coming from lattice studies that the brst symmetry is broken at low energies @xcite .",
    "this is in tune with the expectations for a confining theory : the survival of the original brst symmetry would allow for a definition of the physical spectrum , by its cohomology , in terms of the fundamental fields , thus contradicting confinement .",
    "it is therefore expected that the description of the original perturbative degrees of freedom is modified in the infrared .",
    "this seems to be exactly what happens in pure gauge theories according to lattice results concerning the yang - mills gauge field and ghost propagators in the landau gauge @xcite : positivity violation is observed for the gluon two - point function .",
    "it is well - known @xcite that the two - point function of a physical field is directly related to the probability of propagation of the associated asymptotic state .",
    "therefore , positivity violation , as observed for lattice gluons , hinders the probabilistic interpretation of the two - point function in terms of propagating particles , being consistent with confinement in the sense of absence of colored states from the spectrum .",
    "this is the confinement criterion we adopt ( more discussion can be found in e.g. the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the numerical data also point to gluon propagator that tends to a constant value in the infrared , while the ghost propagator has the behavior of a free particle . in the context of the schwinger - dyson equations ,",
    "this is called the decoupling solution @xcite .",
    "the theoretical description of these results in the continuum has been proposed to be provided by an effective action in the so - called refined gribov - zwanziger ( rgz ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the rgz action is renormalizable and displays a softly broken brst symmetry .",
    "one very important feature of this formalism is the guarantee that the quantum ultraviolet behavior of the theory is under control and the  very successful ",
    "original perturbative yang - mills framework is recovered at high energies .",
    "the rgz action describes a pure gluonic theory and its construction has the geometrical guidance of the original gribov observations about the configuration space of the gauge fields .",
    "its action effectively describes the restriction of the path integral measure to a region without the infinitesimal gribov gauge copies , while also taking into account the formation of condensates .",
    "the resulting action has tree - level propagators that describe very well the lattice data at zero and finite temperature @xcite and can be used to obtain consistent estimates of the masses of glueball states with different quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "an interesting development is that lattice data on propagators suggest a similar behavior for the gauge - interacting matter fields , displaying positivity violation @xcite , as observed for the gluon fields .",
    "furthermore , the theoretical description of these degrees of freedom in the infrared has been conjectured to have the same structure as for the gluon , with an action whose tree - level propagators reproduce very well the lattice data , also displaying softly broken brst symmetry @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed , however , that in the case of matter fields a geometrical interpretation of the modified action as a restriction in the configuration space of the fields is lacking .",
    "this set of affairs led us to expect that a possible signature of confinement would be the soft breaking of the brst symmetry .",
    "in fact this relation has been explored in many works @xcite .",
    "the idea is that confined degrees of freedom are described by an effective action with a brst - breaking soft term .",
    "interestingly , the breaking of the brst invariance may have a connection with chiral symmetry breaking , since the currently known formulations of soft brst breaking in the quark sector always imply chiral symmetry breaking @xcite and thus dynamical mass generation in the deep infrared seems to be intimately related to brst breaking @xcite . in this sense",
    ", one may hope that the investigation of the nonperturbative breaking of the brst symmetry may shed some light on a long - standing puzzle in the qcd phase structure : the apparent and unexplained link between confinement and chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "several effective models of qcd present in the literature address the relation between chiral symmetry breaking and confinement .",
    "two important prototype models extensively explored to address the question of chiral symmetry breaking in the strong interactions are the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) and the quark meson ( qm ) models @xcite , generically called chiral models . on one hand ,",
    "chiral symmetry breaking and restoration is , in chiral models , a result of the interaction of the quark sector either to itself ( in a four - fermion vertex , as in the njl model ) or to meson fields ( as in the qm model ) . on the other hand ,",
    "as an attempt to take into account the physics of confinement , one can introduce a polyakov loop field coupled to quarks @xcite . within the polyakov loop extended njl ( pnjl ) and qm ( pqm ) models , the polyakov loop field effectively encodes the gauge field as an external background that interacts with the quark degrees of freedom , so that the deconfinement transition may be studied in this context as a ( static ) landau - ginzburg system coupled to the chiral model . in spite of their interaction with the polyakov loop",
    ", the quark degrees of freedom in both the pnjl and pqm models physically correspond to asymptotic states , not to confined ones .",
    "this is so because their two - point functions only have poles on the real axis and thus respect the osterwalder - schrader s axiom of reflection positivity @xcite , guaranteeing the establishment of a standard probabilistic description of propagation of asymptotic quarks , in contradiction with real - world qcd .",
    "a possible way to extend the njl model is to include a nonlocal current - current interaction kernel @xcite . as a result",
    ", complex quark masses may appear , indicating confinement in the sense we discussed before .",
    "however , due to its four - fermion interaction , the nonlocal njl model is not renormalizable , similarly to its local version .",
    "besides , it also leads to unstable thermodynamic behavior @xcite .    in the last years",
    ", some works have explored the thermodynamic properties of softly brst broken pure gauge systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in this paper , we explore thermodynamic properties of a model of quarks with soft brst breaking .",
    "as discussed above , this model is expected to describe the infrared properties of confined ( positivity - violating ) quarks , while keeping compatibility with ultraviolet qcd properties .",
    "indeed , the analytical propagator of the model fits well the available lattice data @xcite and the model has been proven to be renormalizable @xcite , reducing to perturbative quarks in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "our goal here is to show not only that soft brst breaking in the quark sector implies a well - defined macroscopic behaviour , but also that the tree level model is capable of predicting nontrivial features , being in general qualitatively compatible with the effect of nonperturbative interactions as observed in lattice data .",
    "furthermore , the instabilities present in the nonlocal njl model are absent from our setup .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the action defining the model . in section",
    "iii the exact partition function is computed within the imaginary - time formalism . in section",
    "iv we obtain the thermodynamic quantities and present our results for the distribution function , the pressure , the entropy , and the trace anomaly .",
    "our conclusions are discussed in section v.",
    "following the discussion of @xcite , let us briefly review how a model with soft breaking of the brst symmetry can be obtained from an extension of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "we start from the gauge - fixed lagrangian density in an euclidean space of dimension 4 , @xmath0\\psi_\\beta^j                   + ib^a\\partial_\\mu a_\\mu^a + \\bar c^a \\partial_\\mu d_\\mu^{ab}c^b,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the field strength and @xmath2 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the indices @xmath3 correspond to adjoint representation and @xmath4 correspond to fields in the fundamental representation of @xmath5 .",
    "the greek indices @xmath6 denote spinor indices while @xmath7 regard euclidean space indices . for more details on notational conventions ,",
    "the reader is referred to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one very important feature of ( [ eq : qcd - lagrangian ] ) is its invariance under brst transformations @xcite ,    @xmath8    which is crucial for its multiplicative renormalizability . as an intermediate step in the definition of the model ,",
    "let us introduce two brst doublets @xmath9 and @xmath10 of auxiliary fields ( and their hermitian conjugate fields ) that transform as @xmath11 the addition of the brst invariant action @xmath12\\nonumber\\\\      & = & \\int d^4x\\left[-\\bar\\lambda_\\alpha^i\\partial^2\\xi_\\alpha^i - \\bar\\xi^i_\\alpha\\partial^2\\lambda_\\alpha^i - \\bar\\eta_\\alpha^i\\partial^2\\theta_\\alpha^i + \\bar\\theta_\\alpha^i\\partial^2\\eta_\\alpha^i + m^2\\left(\\bar\\lambda^i_\\alpha\\xi_\\alpha^i + \\bar\\xi_\\alpha^i\\lambda_\\alpha^i + \\bar\\eta_\\alpha^i\\theta_\\alpha^i - \\bar\\theta_\\alpha^i\\eta_\\alpha^i\\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] does not change the physical content of the theory .",
    "this can be easily checked by integrating the auxiliary fields , which trivially gives @xmath13 . however ,",
    "if one also adds to the action the coupling @xmath14\\ ] ] between the auxiliary fields and the matter fields , the resulting action @xmath15 is no longer brst invariant .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , this does not destroy the renormalizability of the theory once it corresponds to a _",
    "soft _ breaking of the brst symmetry .",
    "in other words , the theory modified by @xmath16 is equivalent to actual qcd in the ultraviolet .",
    "of course , the addition of ( [ eq : brst - breaking ] ) leads to changes of the theory in the infrared with respect to actual qcd and one might ask to what extent such a theory can correctly describe the infrared physics of qcd .",
    "interestingly enough , brst soft breaking terms can be dynamically generated .",
    "for example , gluon condensation may be incorporated in the action and serve as a starting point for an effective theory containing nonperturbative physics @xcite .",
    "indeed , the presence of such condensates leads to a nontrivial infrared behavior of gluon and ghost propagators , which can be also observed in lattice simulations @xcite . in the quark sector of the theory , the brst breaking term ( [ eq : brst - breaking ] )",
    "is conjectured to be a consequence of the condensation of the @xmath17 operator .",
    "the physical meaning of the action @xmath18 becomes clearer after integration in the auxiliary fields @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . as a result ,",
    "due to the brst breaking term @xmath16 , one finds a nonlocal action @xmath23\\psi^j_\\beta\\ ] ] for the quark sector , plus the minimal coupling to the gauge sector . as a first approximation in our model",
    ", we neglect the interaction between the gauge and the matter sectors , except through the nonperturbative term @xmath16 .",
    "notice that the usual local free fermion case can be recovered for @xmath24 .    in the vacuum ,",
    "the tree level fermion propagator reads ( with omission of color and dirac indices ) @xmath25 where we defined the vacuum mass function @xmath26 such a quark mass function is compatible with lattice qcd calculations at zero temperature @xcite as well as with an analysis of the dyson - schwinger equations of the quark propagator @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the mass function ( [ eq : vacuum - mass - function ] ) can be well fitted to the lattice results of @xcite , giving @xmath30gev@xmath31 , @xmath32gev@xmath33 , and @xmath34gev with @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "notice also that the propagator ( [ eq : quark - propagator ] ) has two complex conjugate poles and a real pole .",
    "this can be interpreted as a sign of confinement , a property expected from strongly interacting particles at zero temperature .",
    "once the action of the quark sector @xmath36\\psi_\\beta^i + s_{\\xi\\lambda } + s_m.\\ ] ] is quadratic in the fermion fields , it is possible to calculate the partition function exactly for arbitrary temperatures and chemical potentials . in the next section",
    ", we will calculate the grand canonical partition function of the theory defined by ( [ eq : local - action ] ) .",
    "in order to calculate the partition function of the theory ( [ eq : local - action ] ) , we shall use standard techniques of finite temperature field theory in the matsubara imaginary time formalism @xcite . at finite temperature ,",
    "the 0-direction is compactified ( @xmath37 ) , with @xmath38 and the fermion fields obey anti - periodic boundary conditions in imaginary time . as a consequence",

    "the presence of a net quark charge requires a nonzero quark chemical potential @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , a noether charge can be associated with a global @xmath44 transformation of the type @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "it is crucial to notice that the action ( [ eq : local - action ] ) is invariant under this transformation only if all the auxiliary fields also carry this same charge .",
    "the corresponding noether current is then used to impose the grand canonical constraint on the hamiltonian of the theory .",
    "the calculation is straightforward but it must be carefully performed .",
    "the details of the derivation of the in - medium effective action for the quark fields are given in the appendix ( [ app : effective - action ] ) .",

    "the parameter @xmath143 is originated by a constant pressure , which is negative for positive @xmath143 .",
    "this is exactly the type of contribution included in an _ ad hoc _ manner in a bag model to mimic confinement , and that appears here as a natural consequence of the nontrivial background considered .",
    "an estimate of the bag constant predicted in the high - temperature region of our model can then be obtained from @xmath144 , yielding @xmath145 which nicely falls in the ballpark of the values adopted in the literature of qcd models .",
    "the @xmath136 term in the trace anomaly , however , is usually absent or very small in a nave bag model .",
    "the smallness of this term is directly related to the lightness of up and down quarks . indeed , a _ massive _ bag model has a pressure of the form @xcite : @xmath146 where @xmath147 is the current quark mass .",
    "the respective trace anomaly is @xmath148 .",
    "taking @xmath149 mev , the coefficient of @xmath150 is @xmath151 gev@xmath33 , three orders of magnitude below the value obtained in this fit of our model and also in lattice qcd .",
    "it becomes clear that the presence of a dominant @xmath136 contribution may be linked to the generation of a large mass scale in the nonperturbative quark sector , as the @xmath85 parameter in our model .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that even a bag model that considers effective quark masses large enough to give the desired @xmath150 contribution would fail to reproduce lattice data for @xmath152 mev , due to the nonperturbative peak structure that is developed for lower temperatures .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the @xmath153 case and study some thermodynamic quantities as functions of the chemical potential @xmath43 .",
    "this regime of qcd presents a severe sign problem which hinders the application of montecarlo simulations , so that model predictions are extremely valuable tools to explore this region of the phase diagram .    in fig .",
    "( [ fig3:pressure_zero_temperature ] ) , we show the pressure as a function of the chemical potential , at zero temperature .",
    "we compare the pressure from the model with that of local massive quarks of mass @xmath154 gev , both normalized to the pressure of massless quarks .",
    "the choice of the mass @xmath155 is the one that provides a pressure that better compares to our model results in order to make explicit the differences and the specific features that are exclusive to the confining quark model here studied .",
    "since the system is at zero temperature there is no thermal energy to excite particles at low densities , yielding a vanishing thermodynamical response .",
    "as already observed in the thermal case , the results are fully stable and consistent with general physical expectations for a cold and dense system .",
    "in particular , the pressure vanishes for chemical potentials up to some value @xmath156gev , which is consistent with a dynamically generated scale and not directly connected to any specific mass parameter of the model .",
    "starting at this point , the pressure smoothly rises until reaching the limiting pressure of local quarks for high chemical potentials .",
    "it is not surprising that the massless limit is attained at large chemical potentials , given the @xmath43-dependence of the momentum - dependent mass function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass_function_finitet ] ) .    besides the pressure ,",
    "two other relevant observables that can be calculated are the quark density ( [ eq : quark_density ] ) , and the quark number susceptibility ( [ eq : quark_susceptibility ] ) , as shown in figs .",
    "( [ fig4:quark_density_and_susceptibility]a ) and ( [ fig4:quark_density_and_susceptibility]b ) .",
    "the behavior of these observables is reasonably smooth and interpolates between that of free massless and massive quarks .",
    "the quark susceptibility is a non - monotonic function of the chemical potential , having an oscillation inside the window @xmath157gev , resembling the result for the massive gas of free quarks , but with a smoothened behavior .",
    "even though it is not strictly proven that a first - order phase transition occurs in cold and dense qcd , it has been predicted in several low - energy qcd models .",
    "however , no sharp , first - order transition is observed in our predictions .",
    "the massive parameters in our model , @xmath85 and @xmath147 are fixed by zero - temperature , zero-@xmath43 lattice data for the quark propagator .",
    "they do not depend on temperature nor chemical potential .",
    "a crossover may be reasonably described , but a first - order phase transition needs symmetry changes that , we believe , will only be attained by @xmath158 and @xmath159dependent parameters or condensates , such as @xmath160 .",
    "indeed , @xmath85 can be seen as a nonlocal order parameter for chiral symmetry breaking @xcite and its @xmath161 dependence will thus play a significant role in the chiral phase transition .      in this subsection",
    ", we consider a thermal system with an imbalance between the number of fermions and anti - fermions , given by a finite @xmath43 . in figs .",
    "( 6a ) and ( 6b ) , pressure and quark number density , respectively , are shown as functions of chemical potential for different values of temperature .",
    "these results further support the physical consistency of our model and the absence of thermodynamical instabilities .",
    "moreover , we see that , as temperature increases , more thermal energy becomes available , exciting particles even at lower chemical potentials , as expected .",
    "even though we do not see a first - order phase transition at low temperatures , as discussed above , we do observe two qualitative features generally seen in qcd models : ( i ) a smoothening of the transition as temperature increases and ( ii ) a shift of the inflection point of the curve to lower values of @xmath43 .",
    "in this paper , we made a first exploratory study of the thermodynamics of a softly brst broken quark model .",
    "a soft breaking of the brst symmetry could in principle be present in the infrared regime of qcd without affecting any ultraviolet ( perturbative ) predictions . in this case",
    ", the brst breaking may be intimately related to other nonperturbative phenomena , such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , representing a complementary way to study these issues .",
    "evidence for this breaking has been recently found on lattice studies in the gluon sector @xcite .",
    "it also provides an argument for the absence of asymptotic quarks in the spectrum as well as a good analytical description of nonperturbative quark propagators as compared to lattice .",
    "we adopt the tree - level approximation in our model , so that no explicit quark - gluon interactions are present .",
    "nevertheless , gluon dynamics is encoded in the nontrivial brst - breaking background in the form of a nonlocal quark propagator .",
    "the model reduces itself to a free quark model in the high energy limit , corresponding to the fermionic sector of quantum chromodynamics , and yields an infrared dynamics compatible with the available lattice data for quark propagators . within this model , as in other nonperturbative approaches to qcd , confinement is encoded in the presence of complex poles in the momentum - space quark propagator , i.e. , complex masses .",
    "the quark propagator adopted here has been explicitly shown to violate reflection positivity , being compatible with the absence of asymptotic quark physical states .    despite the presence of the nontrivial brst - breaking background ,",
    "the theory is quadratic in the quark fields .",
    "therefore , the grand canonical partition function of the model could be calculated exactly at finite temperature and chemical potential .",
    "this allowed a computation of several thermodynamic quantities , as shown in the previous section .",
    "it is important to note that this model does not lead to thermodynamic instabilities , in spite of the presence of complex poles in propagator .",
    "we believe that the presence of three poles ( one of them real ) in the propagator of our model is a crucial feature to guarantee the consistency of the thermodynamic predictions , since quark models with pair of complex - conjugated poles alone have displayed unphysical macroscopic behavior @xcite .    besides presenting a consistent thermodynamic behavior ",
    "free of instabilities  , the model displays nontrivial physical results , even at tree level . at finite temperature and vanishing chemical potential",
    ", one sees a nontrivial behavior of thermodynamic observables , which clearly differ from the case of free quarks at low and intermediate temperatures , while recovering the standard free case at high temperatures .",
    "this can be seen as an effect of the momentum - dependent mass function , which is in turn a manifestation of the soft brst breaking .",
    "it is interesting to notice that there is a clear rise in the pressure , as well as a peak in the trace anomaly , at around @xmath164gev , the temperature scale of the deconfinement and chiral restoration crossovers . in spite of this",
    ", one may not associate this change of behavior with a phase transition , as other signatures are not present , as e.g. a dip in the sound velocity .",
    "the model also allowed us to access the region of finite chemical potential at arbitrary temperatures , including a well - defined @xmath94 limit .",
    "the finite density thermodynamics was also shown to contain nontrivial features , differing from an ideal quark gas picture .",
    "the system has no excitations until a threshold chemical potential @xmath165gev is achieved , so that the silver - blaze property @xcite is satisfied . for larger chemical potentials , the limit of massless",
    "free quarks is approached . in spite of the clear excitation threshold @xmath155 , it is probably not correct to interpret the system as a gas of constituent quarks of mass @xmath155 , as can be seen , e.g. , from the comparison of the respective pressures in fig .",
    "( [ fig3:pressure_zero_temperature ] )",
    ". it seems more appropriate to resort to an interpretation in terms of an ensemble of resonances with different masses .",
    "this idea seems to be supported by the momentum and chemical potential dependence of the mass function ( [ eq : mass_function_finitet ] ) . as the chemical potential is increased , more phase space is made available for excitations with different momenta .",
    "given that the mass depends on both @xmath43 and @xmath166 , these newly available states have different masses as those present before .",
    "a similar interpretation seems to be actually possible for any @xmath74 or @xmath43 .",
    "of course , further improvements and perspectives are possible and planned .",
    "our results for the equation of state at large densities and low temperatures may in principle be further developed to investigate whether a physical compact star with a quark matter core could be created in this model .",
    "the explicit inclusion of interactions on top of the already nontrivial nonperturbative background may be implemented through different couplings , such as four - fermion or quark - gluon vertices , to be added perturbatively .",
    "moreover , in order to explicitly compute the polyakov loop in our model one could compute its effective potential in the background field formalism ( for recent pure glue studies , see refs . @xcite and ref.@xcite for the case with heavy quarks ) . this way",
    "one may understand further the significant change of thermodynamic quantities observed here in terms of the approximate order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition .",

    "the first step to calculate the grand partition function is to determine the hamiltonian density of the theory .",
    "it can be obtained from the lagrangian density in minkowski space @xmath167 where , omitting spinor , color , and flavor indices , @xmath168 and @xmath169 and @xmath170 the hamiltonian is the legendre transformation of the lagrangian with respect to the generalized velocity , that is @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the momentum conjugated to the field @xmath173 .",

    "theoretical point of view , such a charge density is consistently defined as the time component of the noether current associated with a global @xmath44 transformation .",
    "let us now define one such transformation for the theory at hand and find the associated noether charge .",

    "this is expressed in the integration symbol @xmath195 notice that one must start from the expression ( [ eq : partition_function_path_integral ] ) , where integration over field momenta must still be made .",

    "<S> the grand partition function of a model of confined quarks is exactly calculated at arbitrary temperatures and quark chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the model is inspired by a softly brst - broken version of qcd and possesses a quark mass function compatible with nonperturbative analyses of lattice simulations and dyson - schwinger equations . even though the model is defined at tree level , we show that it produces a nontrivial and stable thermodynamic behaviour at any temperature or chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> results for the pressure , the entropy and the trace anomaly as a function of the temperature are qualitatively compatible with the effect of nonperturbative interactions as observed in lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the finite density thermodynamics is also shown to contain nontrivial features , being far away from an ideal gas picture . </S>"
