    "the fact that bell inequalities are violated in increasingly convincing experiments @xcite led the majority of the physics community to accept that nature is able to display nonlocal behaviors .",
    "in addition , the violations are such that the predictions of quantum mechanics are strictly observed , and , the so far unbeaten theory is itself said to be nonlocal . but how nonlocal ?",
    "although one feels compelled to quantify any resource that becomes relevant in both , basic science and technology , this program is very hard when one deals with nonlocality .",
    "let us begin with a remark on entanglement , a related but distinct concept .",
    "supposing that the entanglement content of multipartite mixed systems can be characterized by a finite set of numbers , it is not too risky to say that most of us , if not all , would agree on one point : these numbers should be a property of the quantum state alone .",
    "this means that in a hypothetical full - fledged theory of entanglement quantification , no context descriptions should be necessary whatsoever .",
    "for this reason entanglement measures would not be influenced by the fact that quantum mechanics is contextual .",
    "not even this starting point is clear in the case of nonlocality .",
    "many consider that also in this case an ultimate measure should depend only on the state .",
    "but this a less defendable position . nonlocality by its very definition refers to space - time , whose features do not enter in bell s inequalities for intrinsic degrees of freedom ( spin , polarization , etc ) .",
    "most importantly , even from a theoretical perspective , to asses nonlocality one must consider some kind of measurement , which makes unavoidable to face the contextual character of quantum mechanics .",
    "thus , it is not unreasonable to suppose that the nonlocality of a quantum state should display some dependence on the context ( e. g. , on the number and orientations of stern - gerlach apparatuses being employed ) .",
    "one possibility in this direction is to quantify the amount of nonlocality with respect to the setup required to investigate violations of a particular bell s inequality @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the limit imposed by local causality .",
    "a common procedure to induce an ordering in the hilbert space is as follows .",
    "consider a particular state @xmath4 and the bell function associated to the chosen inequality , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the set of parameters that can be varied in the measurement ( it is important to stress that we are restricting our analysis to rank-1 projective measurements ) .",
    "then , a state @xmath7 is said to be more nonlocal than @xmath8 if @xmath9 .",
    "the maximum of the bell function is obtained by visiting all setting parameters .",
    "this relation certainly means that @xmath7 is more correlated than @xmath8 , both being correlated beyond any classical system could be .",
    "but , does it make sense to use this criteria as a measure of nonlocality ?",
    "consider that there are quantum states for which @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the maximum value of @xmath12 according to quantum mechanics .",
    "for definiteness , suppose that @xmath13 and consider two states such that @xmath14 with @xmath15 being a positive number that can be made arbitrarily small .",
    "assume , for simplicity , that these values are attained for the same set of parameters ( e. g. , a particular set of directions ) .",
    "for this fixed situation what makes one states that @xmath7 is more nonlocal ?",
    "perhaps , since the violation by @xmath8 is weaker , the subsystems in this case should be farther away in comparison to those described by @xmath7 in order to enable violations .",
    "another possibility is to think of superluminal signaling .",
    "perhaps , the minimal signal velocity for @xmath7 must be larger than the analogous quantity for @xmath8 : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the speed of light , and @xmath18 is the minimum signal velocity for each state .",
    "however , none of these points can be sustained by facts .",
    "in particular , it is not true that @xmath19 , no matter how small is @xmath15 . since the distance between the subsystems do not enter in the inequalities and",
    "can be arbitrarily large , one would need @xmath20 even if @xmath21 .",
    "the truth is that , for the fixed set of parameters , the two states are equally nonlocal , because the action at a distance required to explain the quantum correlations must be equally `` spooky '' in the two cases .",
    "it is instructive to look at this question from the opposite perspective .",
    "consider two non - violating states @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "is it reasonable to say that , because @xmath24 regarding some particular setting , @xmath22 is more _ local _ than @xmath23 ?",
    "of course not .",
    "if two states are local , nothing else needs to be added .",
    "there are no gradations of locality .",
    "note carefully that it is not being implied that @xmath9 has no meaning with regards to nonlocality . to see this ,",
    "let us vary by a small amount some of the parameters so that the violations are no longer maximal : @xmath25 now , state @xmath8 is local while @xmath7 is still nonlocal , for sufficiently small @xmath15 , with respect to the new setting parameters .",
    "so , it may be appropriate to look at violations for all possible parameters .",
    "what is proposed in reference @xcite is that , for a fixed set of parameters , there should be no gradations of nonlocality , and that it should be assessed only when all experimental situations are considered . in this context",
    ", the state @xmath7 is more nonlocal than @xmath8 if the former violates local causality , no matter by what extent , for a larger number of experimental configurations than the latter .",
    "this consideration led to the definition of the volume of violation @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the subset of @xmath28 containing al violating configurations and @xmath29 .",
    "the measure @xmath30 is such that every configuration is equally important as will become clear in the example of the next section .",
    "note that , according to the above definition , @xmath31 , since @xmath32 , meaning , as expected , that all non - violating states are equally local .",
    "we stress that this definition aims at quantifying the nonlocality of a physical situation , i. e. , of a state @xmath7 under the specific measurements required to test some fixed bell s inequality .",
    "the nonlocal content of a state under a certain kind of measurement , as described by the volume of violation , has been applied to a problem that became known as the `` anomaly '' in the nonlocality @xcite .",
    "it consists in the fact that the collins - gisin - linden - massar - popescu ( cglmp ) inequality @xcite is maximally violated by a state that is not maximally entangled for two entangled qutrits .",
    "it turns out that the supposed anomaly disappears when the volume of violation in used , that is , @xmath33 attains its maximum for the maximally entangled state .",
    "of course , nonlocality and entanglement are distinct quantities , e. g. , the latter is more fragile against noise than the former .",
    "what the referred result seems to indicate is that the difference is not as evident as some results , like the anomaly , initially suggested .",
    "the integrations involved in the determination of the volume of violation for two three - level systems under cglmp measurements required a fully numeric approach , thus , not being very illustrative on how to determine these volumes in detail . in what follows",
    "we show that , at least in the simplest case , that of a spherically symmetric state subjected to a test of the first bell s inequality , the volume of violation can be computed analytically .",
    "in his milestone paper , bell showed that the predictions of quantum mechanics would be , in certain testable situations , in conflict with any theory preserving local causality @xcite .",
    "this fundamental conflict appeared in the form of an inequality for correlations between spin-1/2 measurements made by two parties @xmath34 and @xmath35 sufficiently far apart .",
    "the relation that should be satisfied by any theory compatible with local causality reads @xmath36 is the average value of the product of the result of spin measurements obtained by @xmath34 along direction @xmath37 and by @xmath35 along direction @xmath38 . denoting the possible outcomes by @xmath39 and @xmath40 we get @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the probability for results @xmath39 in @xmath34 and @xmath39 in @xmath35 , and so on .",
    "hereafter we will address the singlet state @xmath43 ) with @xmath44 being the eigenstates of @xmath45 for _ any _ direction @xmath46 , with @xmath47 , @xmath48 denoting the pauli matrices .",
    "this greatly facilitates our task .",
    "since there are no privileged directions , without loss of information , we can assume that one of the measurement directions is fixed in the space , say , @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , the correlations assume a particularly simple form for the singlet , namely , @xmath50 .",
    "the inequality ( [ bell1 ] ) becomes @xmath51 , @xmath52 @xmath53 $ ] are the azimuthal angles of @xmath54 and @xmath38 , respectively , and @xmath55 @xmath56 $ ] is the difference between the corresponding polar coordinates",
    ". the complementary variable @xmath57 $ ] does not enter in the inequality .",
    "we , thus , have a four - dimensional space of parameters , which we denote by @xmath58 .",
    "we intend to calculate volumes in this space , in particular the volume of the subset @xmath59 ( for the singlet ) which corresponds to setting parameters that lead to violations in ( [ bell1b ] ) .",
    "the measure of integration must be neutral in the sense that any configuration is equally relevant , that is @xmath60 where , in the first line the polar integrations are over a square with side length of @xmath61 and in the second line the integrations are also over a square domain , see fig [ fig1 ] , delimited by @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "this leads to a total volume of    [ fig1 ] -@xmath64 domain the inequality is trivially satisfied . in the darker regions",
    "local causality ( lc ) may be violated.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    @xmath65    corresponding to the product of two solid angles , as it should be ( we are skipping the trivial solid angle corresponding to rotations of @xmath37 ) .",
    "our objective is to calculate the volume of the set @xmath59 , or more importantly , the ratio between the volumes of @xmath59 and @xmath58 , that we define as the relative volume of violation @xmath66 . for half of the possible configurations we have @xmath67",
    "this situation ( @xmath68 ) obviously corresponds to one half of the violating configurations and , therefore , one can focus on it , doubling the result in the end .",
    "in addition , since @xmath69 and @xmath70 are non negative in @xmath71 $ ] we can write @xmath72 . for @xmath73 and @xmath74 ,",
    "the inequality assumes the more symmetrical form @xmath75 where we defined the one - to - one relations @xmath76 , @xmath77 $ ] . if we split @xmath78 in the intervals shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , covering @xmath79 $ ] , then , in the lighter regions the inequality is trivially fulfilled @xmath80 . in the remaining regions , where @xmath81",
    ", it is harmless to write @xmath82 accordingly , the surfaces delimiting the violating region are given by @xmath83 and the planes @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the variable @xmath87 $ ] which defines a one - to - one relation in _ each _ of the four dark parts in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , namely , @xmath88,\\ ; [ -\\pi/2,0],\\ ; [ 0,\\pi/2],\\ ; [ 3\\pi/2,2\\pi]\\;.\\ ] ] in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show one of these four tridimensional cells .    [ fig2 ] , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "all variables are dimensionless.,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ]    the volume of violation of the singlet state is , then , given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the restriction of @xmath93 to @xmath94 , and @xmath95 which gives a family of curves in the @xmath96 plane as @xmath78 varies .",
    "note that for @xmath97 we have @xmath98 as can be seen on the top of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , while for @xmath99 we get @xmath85 .",
    "the volume in eq .",
    "( [ int ] ) can be written as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the area in the @xmath96 plane delimited by @xmath102 and @xmath85 .",
    "we only need to consider the variable @xmath78 in the regions ( [ intervals ] ) .",
    "the symmetric intervals with respect to @xmath103 are equivalent and , thus , we get @xmath104 we now conclude the change of variables @xmath105 . in the first interval ( @xmath106 \\rightarrow z \\in [ 1,0]$ ] ) @xmath107 while in the second interval ( @xmath108 \\rightarrow z \\in [ 0,1]$ ] ) @xmath109 .",
    "we , therefore , have @xmath110 with @xmath111 in the first interval and @xmath112 in the second interval .",
    "gathering all this together we obtain @xmath113 it is easy to find @xmath114\\;,\\ ] ] which turns out to be a quite inconvenient representation of @xmath34 , since its direct insertion in integration ( [ int3 ] ) leads to divergencies .",
    "the second and third terms in the previous equation lead to an indetermination of type `` @xmath115 '' . this can be dealt with by expanding the logarithm around @xmath97 .",
    "we get @xmath116 which is explicitly finite under ( [ int3 ] ) .",
    "in addition , since it is a convergent series in the range of definition of @xmath117 , one can interchange the ordering of summation and integration , leading to @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes the gamma function .",
    "the infinite series can be written in terms of a hypergeometric function as @xmath120\\times\\,_2f_1(1/2,1;3;1)$ ] , which gives @xmath121 and , thus @xmath122 therefore , the relative volume of violation of the spin-1/2 singlet state is 1/3 with respect to the first bell s inequality .",
    "by reasoning that the numeric value of a bell function should be taken as a witness , rather than as a quantifier of nonlocality ( and of locality ) , a new measure has been defined @xcite . in this paper",
    "we showed that this quantity can be analytically calculated for the singlet state in the setup necessary to investigate the first bell s inequality .",
    "our result means that if we randomly pick three directions in space , without any bias , then , the probability that the selected configuration will lead to a violation in local causality is @xmath0 .",
    "this may serve as an initial test to numerical procedures aiming at the calculation of volumes of violation associated to more complex states and contexts .    from a quantum communications perspective",
    ", our result means that two distant parties that were able to align their measurement apparatuses in _ one _ direction only , the remaining direction in each site being random , have a probability to certify their entanglement of about 33.3 @xmath1 ( for the singlet ) .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "for the first bell s inequality one of the measurement directions , in our notation @xmath38 [ see eq .",
    "( [ bell1 ] ) ] , is present in the arguments referring to @xmath34 and @xmath35 , thus , they have to agree on that direction in advance .",
    "had we considered the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality @xcite , then no alignment would be required whatsoever and the probability to certify entanglement would be much lower . according to our numerical results ,",
    "it is about @xmath123 .",
    "conversely , it is well known that the first bell s inequality derives from chsh , which involves four independent directions ( say @xmath124 ) , when we set @xmath125 .",
    "these same issues were addressed in @xcite , where the authors employ the very concept of volume of violation ( but not in the context of measures of nonlocality ) .",
    "the authors of reference @xcite became aware of these publications very recently .",
    "an interesting perspective is to extend the concept of volume of violation to positive - operator - valued measurements ( povm s ) , especially for inequalities where these more general measurements are required in order to attain maximal violation @xcite . in this context",
    "a physically relevant question arises : given a fixed inequality and a set of povm s , does the volume of violation depend on the particular naimark realization that is employed ?    even with the simplifications brought by spherical symmetry , the volume of violation regarding the settings of the chsh inequality amounts to a five - dimensional integration , which , so far , we were not able to carry out analytically .",
    "the main goal is to compare this volume to that of the popescu - rohrlich box @xcite .",
    "since we are arguing that the numeric value of a bell function is being overrated , the fact that these probability boxes can yield @xmath126 for the chsh inequality , does not necessarily mean that they are more nonlocal than quantum mechanics , at least in the framework of our proposal .",
