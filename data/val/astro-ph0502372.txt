    "observations of astrophysical objects with relativistic plasma outflows generally show frequency spectra dominated by power - law segments .",
    "these objects count gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and active galactic nuclei .",
    "the general interpretations of such observations are that 1 ) electrons are accelerated to power - law distributions @xmath0 in the collisionless shock interface between the relativistic ejecta and the surrounding media and 2 ) the accelerated electrons radiate through synchrotron radiation in the downstream region of the shock .",
    "the magnetic field strength required to account for the observed radiation spectra is typically of the order of percents of equipartition . a complete physical model for relativistic collisionless shocks should account for both the origin of such strong magnetic fields and for acceleration of electrons to power - law distributions .    regarding the origin of the magnetic field",
    ", particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations have shown that the weibel two - stream instability can generate a small scale , but strong , magnetic field transverse to the jet flow ( @xmath1 where @xmath2 describes the fraction of total injected kinetic energy that is converted to magnetic energy ) @xcite .",
    "other pic simulations have found that the ambient large scale magnetic field neccesary to quench this instability has to be significantly stronger than the @xmath3 g field typically found in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite .    regarding the non - thermal electron acceleration , monte carlo test - particle simulations have shown that fermi acceleration can provide electron power - law distributions under some assumptions about the shock and magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has , however , not been conclusively demonstrated to occur in ab initio particle simulations .",
    "pic simulations have shown that both thermal and non - thermal particle acceleration take place in the shock transition region @xcite .    in this paper , we discuss the particle dynamics in collisionless shocks based on results from a three dimensional relativistic pic code . we propose a new particle acceleration mechanism that is itself a consequence of the weibel two - stream instability @xcite .",
    "we have performed computer experiments using a charged particle - in - cell code .",
    "the code works from first principles by solving maxwell s equations for the electromagnetic fields and the lorentz force equation of motion for the particles .",
    "the fields are defined on a numerical grid and the particles are defined in a continuous phase space .",
    "we use a computational box with @xmath4 grid points and a plasma consisting of @xmath5 ions and electrons .",
    "the ion rest - frame plasma frequency is @xmath6 , rendering the box 150 ion skin depths long .",
    "the electron rest - frame plasma frequency is @xmath7 in order to resolve the microphysics of the electrons .",
    "hence , the ion - to - electron mass ratio is @xmath8 .         in the experiments we study the microphysics of two colliding plasma populations .",
    "the experiments are carried out in the rest frame of one of the populations ( downstream , e.g. , a jet ) . in this frame , a less dense population ( upstream , e.g. the ism ) is continuously injected at the leftmost boundary @xmath9 .",
    "we have performed two runs with relativistic velocities corresponding to lorentz factors @xmath10 and @xmath11 . initially , the jet plasma is denser by a factor of three and both plasma populations are unmagnetized .",
    "the boundaries in the direction transverse to the jet flow ( @xmath12 ) are periodic . at the @xmath13-boundaries ,",
    "electromagnetic waves are absorbed and we allow particles to escape in order to avoid unphysical feedback .",
    "the experiment last until @xmath14 340 @xmath15 , which is sufficient for the continuously injected upstream ism - plasma to travel 2.3 times the length of the box .",
    "the results from the experiments show how the weibel two - stream instability forms current filaments in the region where the two plasma populations interpenetrate and how these filaments merge into increasingly larger patterns further downstream ( fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] _ left panel _ ) ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the induced magnetic field grows to @xmath16 .",
    "we identify two mechanism that accelerate electrons .",
    "the first is thermalization caused by random deflections by the generated small scale electromagnetic field .",
    "this mechanism is dominant for the @xmath10 run . in the @xmath11",
    "run a second acceleration mechanism becomes important .",
    "here we briefly discuss this mechanism ( for details please see @xcite ) :    the generated ion current channels are debye shielded by the heated electrons . at distances less than the debye length ,",
    "the current channels are surrounded by transverse electric fields that accelerate the electrons toward the current channels .",
    "the acceleration happens in an approximately electrostatic field and is a simple consequence of potential energy being converted into kinetic energy .",
    "therefore , the electrons are decelerated again when leaving the current channel and reach their maximal velocities at the centers of the current channels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] ) .",
    "it has been shown that a spatial fourier decomposition of the transverse ion filaments in the box exhibits power - law behavior @xcite .",
    "hence , the number of accelerated electrons is expected to reflect this power - law behavior .",
    "this relation is confirmed in fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw ] .",
    "the left panel shows a scatter plot of electron momentum ( @xmath17 ) plotted against the strength of the electric current sampled at each electrons position . there is a power - law correlation between the electron energy and the local current density . some deviations from the power - law",
    "is found : cold trapped thermal electrons ( indicated with the ellipse ) exist inside the ion current channel and count towards lowering the average four velocity at high @xmath18 .",
    "also , heated electrons are found outside the current channels which increase the average four velocity at low @xmath18 .",
    "the electron distribution function can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : powerlaw ] .",
    "it show a thermal distribution with a power - law component at high energies .",
    "the slope of the power - law segment corresponds to a spectral index of p=2.7 .     versus the four velocity of the electrons in a region downstream of the shock .",

    "we have investigated magnetic field generation and particle acceleration in collisionless shocks using three dimensional charged particle - in - cell experiments . the results are applicable to interactions between relativistic outflows and the interstellar medium .",
    "such relativistic outflows occur in grbs and in jets from compact objects .",
    "we observe how the weibel two - stream instability is excited and find that the non - linear stage of the instability penetrates at least 150 ion skin depths into the shock ramp . extrapolating to the real electron - ion mass ratio , this is more than 6000 electron skin depths .",
    "the instability efficiently creates a strong , small - scale magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) .    regarding particle acceleration ,",
    "the results show that thermalization dominates the electron distribution in the simulation run where a jet is expanding with @xmath10 . at @xmath11 ,",
    "a new acceleration mechanism becomes important in the high energy tail of the spectrum .",
    "the acceleration is non - thermal and the resulting electron distribution function has a power - law segment .",
    "the slope of this segment corresponds to @xmath20 .",
    "we emphasize that the generation of magnetic field and the non - thermal acceleration of electrons are two highly interconnected processes in collisionless shocks . the acceleration is closely tied to the spatial distribution of electric current filaments .",
    "further large scale simulations are need to determine how this slope depends on different parameters .",
    "when the injected ism ions has traveled through the simulation box they are not merged with the jet ions to a single population .",
    "this indicates that larger simulations are needed to cover the whole shock ramp ."
