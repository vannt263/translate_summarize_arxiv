    "the results of solar  @xcite , atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite and accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments show that flavour mixing occurs not only in the hadronic sector , as it has been known for long , but in the leptonic sector as well .",
    "the full understanding of the leptonic mixing matrix constitutes , together with the discrimination of the dirac / majorana character of neutrinos and with the measurement of their absolute mass scale , the main goal of neutrino physics for the next decade .",
    "the experimental results point to two very distinct mass - squared differences , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "only two out of the four parameters of the three - family leptonic mixing matrix @xmath8  @xcite are known : @xmath9 and @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "the other two parameters , @xmath5 and @xmath11 , are still unknown : for the mixing angle @xmath5 direct searches at reactors  @xcite and three - family global analysis of the experimental data give the upper bound @xmath12 , whereas for the leptonic cp - violating phase @xmath11 we have no information whatsoever ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the lsnd data  @xcite , on the other hand , would indicate a @xmath13 oscillation with a third neutrino mass - squared difference : @xmath14 , about two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath15 .",
    "given the strong hierarchy among the solar , atmospheric and lsnd mass - squared splittings , @xmath16 , it is not possible to explain all these data with just three massive neutrinos , as it has been shown with detailed calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite . a necessary condition to explain the whole ensemble of data in terms of neutrino oscillations is therefore the introduction of _ at least _ a fourth light neutrino state .",
    "this new light neutrino must be an electroweak singlet  @xcite in order to comply with the strong bounds on the @xmath17 invisible decay width  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the lsnd signal has often been considered as an evidence of the existence of a sterile neutrino .    in recent years",
    ", global analyses of solar , atmospheric , short - baseline  @xcite experiments and lsnd data have been performed to establish whether four - neutrino models can really reconcile the data and solve the puzzle  @xcite .",
    "the point is that providing a suitable mass - squared difference to each class of experiments is not enough : it is also necessary to show that the intrinsic structure of the neutrino mixing matrix is compatible with all the data .",
    "this turned out to be very hard to accomplish . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that four - neutrino models were only marginally allowed , with best fit around @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "generically speaking , the global analysis indicated that a single sterile neutrino state was not enough to reconcile lsnd with the other experiments .",
    "for this reason , to improve the statistical compatibility between the lsnd results and the rest of the oscillation data , models with two sterile neutrino states have been tested ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "although a slightly better global fit was achieved , a strong tension between the lsnd data and the results from atmospheric and short - baseline experiments was still present .",
    "so far , the lsnd signal has not been confirmed by any other experiment  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that the lsnd anomaly arises from some some yet unknown problem in the data set itself . to close the issue , the miniboone collaboration  @xcite at fermilab",
    "has recently performed a search for @xmath3 appearance with a baseline of 540 m and a mean neutrino energy of about 700 mev .",
    "the primary purpose of this experiment was to test the evidence for @xmath20 oscillation observed at lsnd with a very similar @xmath21 range .",
    "no evidence of the expected signal has been found , hence ruling out once and for all the four - neutrino interpretation of the lsnd anomaly .",
    "however , miniboone data are themselves not conclusive : although no evidence for @xmath3 oscillation has been reported in the spectrum region compatible with lsnd results , an unexplained excess has been observed for lower energy neutrinos .",
    "furthermore , within a five - neutrino model this excess can be easily explained , and even reconciled with lsnd and all the other _ appearance _ experiments  @xcite . on the other hand , a post - miniboone global analysis including also _ disappearance _ data show that five - neutrino models suffer from the same problems as four - neutrino schemes , and in particular they are now only marginally allowed  a situation very similar to that of four - neutrino models before miniboone data . adding a third sterile neutrino is @xmath22 , ( 3 + 3 ) light majorana neutrinos are present at low - energy  @xcite . ] does not help  @xcite , and in general global analyses seem to indicate that sterile neutrinos alone are not enough to reconcile all the data . models with sterile neutrinos and exotic physics have been therefore proposed ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in summary ,",
    "the present experimental situation is still confused .",
    "it is therefore worthwile to understand if , aside of miniboone , new neutrino experiments currently running or under construction can investigate the existence of sterile neutrinos separated from the active ones by @xmath0 mass - squared differences . in this paper",
    "we explore in detail the capability of the cngs beam to perform this search . for definiteness",
    "we focus on the simplest case with only one extra sterile neutrino .",
    "note that this model is perfectly viable once the lsnd result is dropped , as it contains as a limiting case the usual three - neutrino scenario .",
    "furthermore , it is easily generalizable by adding new sterile neutrino states , and it can be used as a basis for models with extra `` sterile '' states strongly decoupled from active neutrinos ( such as in extra - dimensions models with a right - handed neutrino in the bulk  @xcite ) .",
    "the cngs beam  @xcite has been built to test the ( supposedly ) dominant oscillation in atmospheric neutrino data , @xmath23 . in order to make possible @xmath24 production through cc interactions ,",
    "the mean neutrino energy , @xmath25 gev , is much above the atmospheric oscillation peak for the cern to gran sasso baseline , @xmath26 km .",
    "two detectors are illuminated by the cngs beam : opera ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein ) will start data taking with the lead - emulsion target in 2007 ; icarus - t600 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and refs . therein ) will start operating in 2008 .",
    "both detectors have been especially designed to look for @xmath24 s produced through @xmath23 oscillation and to minimize the corresponding backgrounds .",
    "the expected number of @xmath24 events after signal selection in an experiment such as opera ( after five years of data taking with nominal cngs luminosity ) is @xmath27 events with @xmath28 background event .    at the cngs distance and energy , neutrino oscillations mediated by an @xmath0 mass difference",
    "will appear as a constant term in the oscillation probability . in four - neutrino models , fluctuations induced by this term over the atmospheric @xmath23 oscillation",
    "can be as large as 100% for specific points of the allowed parameter space .",
    "this is due to the fact that the leading angle for this oscillation is the less constrained one .",
    "the @xmath23 channel , therefore , is extremely promising as a `` sterile neutrino '' smoking gun , as it has been commented elsewhere ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . to test the model",
    "we will also make use of the @xmath3 channel .",
    "notice that the background to this signal coming from @xmath29 decay is modified in four - neutrino models with respect to standard three - family oscillations .",
    "in fact , since @xmath23 oscillations are depleted by active - sterile mixing with respect to standard ones , the @xmath29 background to @xmath3 oscillations gets depleted , too .",
    "a combined analysis of the two channels in four - neutrino models at the opera detector has been performed , taking into account properly all of the backgrounds .",
    "we stress , however , that the same analysis could be performed at icarus , as well .",
    "the previous considerations hold for any facility operating well beyond the kinematical threshold for @xmath24 production .    in the specific case of the cngs beam",
    ", the limited flux implies a modest improvement in the parameter space exclusion , see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "an increase in the exposure of such facilities , however , would permit to improve the present bounds on the parameters of four - neutrino models and , in particular , to constrain the leading angle in @xmath23 oscillations at the level of the other mixing parameters .",

    "sec : schemes ] we briefly review the main features of four - neutrino models and we introduce our parametrization of the mixing matrix . in sec .  [",

    "_ ]    in four - neutrino models , one extra sterile state is added to the three weakly interacting ones .",
    "the relation between the flavor and the mass eigenstates is then described by a @xmath30 unitary matrix @xmath31 , which generalizes the usual @xmath32 matrix @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "as stated in the introduction , in this work we only consider the case when the fourth mass eigenstate is separated by the other three by an @xmath0 mass - squared gap .",
    "there are six possible four - neutrino schemes , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes ] , that can accommodate the results from solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments and contain a third much larger @xmath33 .",
    "they can be divided in two classes : ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) . in the ( 3 + 1 ) schemes , there is a group of three close - by neutrino masses that is separated from the fourth one by the larger gap . in ( 2 + 2 ) schemes ,",
    "there are two pairs of close masses separated by the large gap .",
    "while different schemes within the same class are presently indistinguishable , schemes belonging to different classes lead to very different phenomenological scenarios .",
    "a characteristic feature of ( 2 + 2 ) schemes is that the extra sterile state can not be simultaneously decoupled from _ both _ solar and atmospheric oscillations . to understand why ,",
    "let us define @xmath34 where the sums in @xmath35 and @xmath36 run over mass eigenstates involved in solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations , respectively .",
    "clearly , the quantities @xmath37 and @xmath38 describe the fraction of sterile neutrino relevant for each class of experiment .",
    "results from atmospheric and solar neutrino data imply that in both kind of experiments oscillation takes place mainly between active neutrinos .",
    "specifically , from fig .",
    "46 of ref .",
    "@xcite we get @xmath39 and @xmath40 at the @xmath41 level .",
    "however , in ( 2 + 2 ) schemes unitarity implies @xmath42 , as can be easily understood by looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : schemes ] .",
    "these models are therefore ruled out at a very high confidence level  @xcite , and in the rest of this work we will not consider them anymore .    on the other hand , ( 3 + 1 ) schemes are not affected by this problem .",
    "although the experimental bounds on @xmath37 and @xmath38 quoted above still hold , the condition @xmath42 no longer applies . for what concerns neutrino oscillations , ( 3 + 1 ) models are essentially unfalsifiable , since they reduce to the conventional three - neutrino scenario when the mixing between active and sterile states are small enough .",
    "the mixing matrix @xmath31 can be conveniently parametrized in terms of six independent rotation angles @xmath43 and three ( if neutrinos are dirac fermions ) or six ( if neutrinos are majorana fermions ) phases @xmath44 . in oscillation experiments , only the so - called `` dirac phases '' can be measured , the effect of the `` majorana phases '' being suppressed by factors of @xmath45 .",
    "the majorana or dirac nature of neutrinos can thus be tested only in @xmath46 transitions such as neutrino - less double @xmath47-decay  @xcite or lepton number violating decays  @xcite . in the following analysis , with no loss in generality",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case of 4 dirac - type neutrinos only .",
    "a generic rotation in a four - dimensional space can be obtained by performing six different rotations along the euler axes . since the ordering of the rotation matrices @xmath48 ( where @xmath49 refers to the plane in which the rotation takes place ) is arbitrary , plenty of different parametrizations of the mixing matrix @xmath31 are allowed . the large parameter space ( 6 angles and 3 phases , to be compared with the standard three - family mixing case of 3 angles and 1 phase )",
    "is however reduced to a subspace whenever some of the mass differences become negligible .",
    "if the eigenstates @xmath35 and @xmath36 are degenerate , rotations in the @xmath49-plane become unphysical and the corresponding mixing angle should drop from oscillation probabilities . if the matrix @xmath48 is the rightmost one the angle @xmath43 automatically disappears , since the matrix commutes with the vacuum hamiltonian .",
    "the parameter space gets therefore reduced to the physical angles and phases .",
    "if a different ordering of the rotation matrices is taken , no angle explicitly disappears from the oscillation formulas , but the physical parameter space is still smaller than the original one . in this case , a parameter redefinition is needed to reduce the parameter space to the observable sector . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was shown how the one - mass dominance ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52  @xcite ) and two - mass dominance ( @xmath53 ) approximations can be implemented in a transparent way ( in the sense that only the physical parameters appear in oscillation probabilities ) using a parametrization in which rotations are performed in the planes corresponding to smallest mass difference first : @xmath54 this parametrization was shown to be particularly useful when maximizing oscillations driven by a @xmath0 mass difference .",
    "the analytical expressions for the oscillation probabilities in the ( 3 + 1 ) model in the one - mass dominance approximation in this parametrization have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper , however , we are interested in a totally different regime : the `` atmospheric regime '' , with oscillations driven by the atmospheric mass difference , @xmath55 .",
