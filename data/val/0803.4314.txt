    "the interest in the analysis of differential operators on metric graphs has been driven by the idea that some physical systems can be well modeled by using lower dimensional approximations .",
    "intuitively one expects that graph - like approximations can be used to describe the dynamics in constrained systems characterized by two scales of length : a `` large '' one along the direction of the edges and `` small '' ones in the transverse directions .    in mathematics",
    "a metric graph is a one dimensional singular manifold , and is defined by assigning points , the vertices connected by a set of oriented segments , the edges .",
    "the dynamics on the graphs is fixed by defining a differential ( or pseudo - differential ) operator on the graph and boundary conditions in the vertices . in the following",
    "we shall consider only self - adjoint operators .",
    "when this kind of structures arise as approximations of quantum systems , it is customary to call them quantum graphs . in this case",
    "the self - adjointness assumption is natural .",
    "one of the first and most famous applications of quantum graphs dates back to 1953 , when they were used to model the dynamics of @xmath0 electrons in organic molecules @xcite . more recently",
    "a renewed interest in quantum graphs has resulted from the development of nanotechnologies . at present devices based on carbon nanotubes and metallic nanowires",
    "are commonly produced and studied . in such structures",
    "the mean free path can reach hundreds of micrometers , while the transverse confinement can be of the order of ten nanometers .",
    "because of their small dimensions and purity such devices represent an ideal framework for the analysis of many peculiar phenomena of quantum mechanics , see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , and in many applications they can be treated as one dimensional systems . for a comprehensive review on properties and applications of quantum graphs",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . even in the field of classical mechanics",
    "there is a huge number of problems in which metric graphs define simplified but non trivial models .",
    "typical examples arise in the analysis of electromagnetic or acoustic waves in thin waveguides .",
    "many efforts have been done in the last fifteen years to understand to which extent a one dimensional dynamics on a metric graph approximates the dynamics in a constrained system .",
    "aim of this work is to investigate some relevant features of graph - like approximations for the quantum dynamics in networks of thin tubes .    to understand the core of the problem it is sufficient to discuss the case of a graph with one vertex and @xmath1 infinite edges .",
    "the natural hilbert space for such a system is the direct sum of @xmath1 copies of @xmath2 and its generic element is @xmath3 with @xmath4 . we restrict ourselves to a setting in which the dynamics on the graph is generated by an hamiltonian that on each edge coincides with the ( positive ) laplacian . from the mathematical point of view",
    "one can define several self - adjoint operators on the graph that coincide with the laplacian on the edges .",
    "each element of this family of operators is identified by the boundary conditions in the vertex imposed on the functions in its domain . in the following",
    "we shall call the boundary conditions in the vertex _",
    "gluing conditions_. a linear relation between @xmath5 and @xmath6 must be used to fix the gluing conditions in a way such that the corresponding operator on the graph is self - adjoint . making use of krein s theory",
    "one can characterize all the possible self - adjoint gluing conditions in the vertex .",
    "this was done by kostrykin and schrader in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; for each vertex of degree @xmath1 there are @xmath7 real free parameters to fix the gluing conditions .",
    "two well known examples of self - adjoint gluing conditions are @xmath8 and @xmath9 condition is usually called _ decoupling condition _ or _",
    "dirichlet condition_. we shall use the expression _ decoupling condition _ to keep in mind that this type of gluing in the vertex implies decoupling among the edges , i.e. , no transmission trough",
    "the vertex is possible .",
    "condition is usually referred to as condition of _ free type _ or _",
    "kirchhoff type_. in our opinion the expression condition of kirchhoff type is a bit misleading .",
    "it recalls current conservation in electric circuits but as a matter of fact every self - adjoint gluing condition conserves the quantum probability current across the vertex .",
    "the expression free condition seems more appropriate because generalizes the free one dimensional laplacian to a non trivial topology .    in view of applications",
    "one is interested in understanding which gluing conditions are more appropriate to model strongly constrained quantum systems . a standard strategy to approach this problem consists in the analysis of the limit , in some suitable sense , of the laplacian in a network of thin tubes as the network shrinks to the underlying graph .",
    "let us assume that the network we consider is made up of tubes that far from the vertex are straight and of constant width . to fix ideas we also suppose that the tubes have all the same width . in this",
    "setting , far from the vertex , the dynamics is factorized in the direction along the axes of the tube and in the transverse direction .",
    "moreover as the manifold shrinks the energy gap between the transverse modes increases as the inverse of the squared width of the tube . even if this simple picture fails as one approaches to the vertex , it suggests that the natural way to reduce the dynamics to one on the underlying graph is to project onto the transverse modes and that , in the limit of zero width , each projection can lead to a unitary dynamics , that is an effective dynamics which leaves invariant the subspace associated to the transverse mode .",
    "the feasibility of this procedure and the corresponding limit operator on the graph depend on the boundary conditions that one imposes on the boundary of the tubes and on which transverse mode the projection is taken .    in this paper",
    "we discuss this problem in the most simple geometrical setting .",
    "we take as initial domain @xmath10 , a strip of constant width @xmath11 around a base curve @xmath12 and we assume that @xmath12 has no self - intersections . under this assumptions the model is greatly simplified by the presence of a global system of coordinates @xmath13 adapted to the geometry of the system , where @xmath14 is the arc length coordinate on @xmath12 and @xmath15 is the orthogonal coordinate . the relevant geometric quantity",
    "are @xmath11 and the scalar curvature of the curve , @xmath16 , that in our hypothesis is a smooth and compactly supported function .",
    "we rescale the initial domain according to @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a big enough positive constant , and we obtain a net of domains @xmath21 which as @xmath22 collapses onto a broken line , i.e. , onto a graph made up of one vertex and two infinite edges .",
    "we consider the laplacian on @xmath21 with robin boundary conditions and discuss its convergence to the laplacian on the limit domain which can be seen as the most simple example of graph .",
    "the most relevant technical part of the present paper consists in the proof that the projection of the dynamics on the @xmath23-th transverse mode is unitary in the limit @xmath24 , and that the effective dynamics is described by the hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 are some coefficients related to the energy of the transverse mode .",
    "the analysis of the limit for @xmath22 of hamiltonians of the form of @xmath27 was performed in the former work by the same authors @xcite .",
    "for each @xmath23 the limit operator depends on the low energy properties of the hamiltonian @xmath28 @xmath29 more precisely , under our assumptions on @xmath16 two cases can occur    1 .",
    "there does not exist a zero energy resonance for the definition of zero energy resonance . ] for @xmath28 , then @xmath27 converges to the laplacian on the graph with decoupling gluing conditions in the vertex .",
    "there exists a zero energy resonance @xmath30 , for @xmath28 .",
    "in such a case one can define two real constants @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 , and the limit operator on the graph is the laplacian with gluing conditions given by @xmath33    the convergence has to be intended in the norm resolvent sense .",
    "we remark that the existence of a zero energy resonance is an exceptional event , that in our case is related to some very special choices of the initial curve @xmath12 , see @xcite for few examples .",
    "this implies that in most of the cases the limit operator is defined by decoupling conditions in the vertex .",
    "for this reason we call the case 1 _ generic _ and the case 2 _ non - generic_.    the gluing conditions are known in literature as scale invariant , see @xcite , and are parameterized by one independent real parameter , e.g. , the ratio @xmath34 . by using the result proved in @xcite we shall see that , in the non - generic case , a deformation of order @xmath35 of the angle @xmath36 between the edges of the graph leads to a more general class of gluing conditions , i.e. , the ones defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a real constant related to the deformation parameter .",
    "it is worth noticing that in the non - generic case the gluing conditions in the vertex implies a coupling between the edges ; our analysis includes a wide class of boundary conditions and holds for all transverse modes .",
    "the first results in the same direction presented here , in a setting with several edges , concerned the case of compact networks of tubes with neumann boundary conditions . in @xcite",
    "was proved the convergence of the solutions of the heat equation on the network to the corresponding solution of the equation on the graph .",
    "the proof made use of some results on the convergence of markov processes proved in the same paper . in a similar setting the convergence of the spectrum was proved in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in all these works the gluing conditions arising in the limit are of free type . the most recent result on the neumann problem ( and in a setting in which the approximating manifold has no boundary ) ,",
    "was given in @xcite .",
    "in the latter work in the case of compact and non compact networks , was proved the strong resolvent convergence to the operator on the graph with gluing conditions in the vertex of free type .",
    "in all the aforementioned papers , only the projection onto the lowest transverse mode was considered .",
    "the case we just described is the most simple one . in this",
    "setting the energy of the lowest transverse mode is equal to zero and , in a neighborhood of the vertex , one is allowed to approximate the wave function on the network with a constant function .",
    "the case with dirichlet boundary conditions has revealed much more tricky .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the latter case the energy of the transverse modes always increases as the inverse squared width of the tubes and this forces to rescale the hamiltonian by subtracting the divergent energy term .",
    "the scaled operator has a finite number of eigenvalues which all diverge as the network squeezes .",
    "a first result on the problem with dirichlet boundary was given in @xcite . in a setting of a compact network",
    "it was proved that the limit operator on the graph is characterized by decoupling conditions in the vertex .",
    "it is worth noticing that in this work the decoupling was obtained as a consequence of an ad hoc hypothesis on the volume of the manifold in a neighborhood of the vertex .",
    "recently d. grieser @xcite has proved that , for a large class of boundary conditions , generically the limit gluing conditions are of decoupling type .",
    "this was already argued by s. molchanov and b. vainberg , see @xcite . in these works , for compact networks , the spectral convergence of the laplacian on the network to the operator on the graph is studied ; the approach is based on the analysis of the scattering problem associated to the network of tubes and makes use of the analytic properties of the resolvent of the laplacian on the manifold . the special cases in which the coupling occurs are related to the existence of singularity of the resolvent at the thresholds of the energy of the transverse modes .",
    "earlier the existence of a non - decoupling limit in the dirichlet case was proved in @xcite for the same model discussed in this paper .",
    "such a model was proposed for the first time as a prototype of a dirichlet network collapsing onto a graph in @xcite where the generic case leading to decoupling conditions was discussed .    in view of applications",
    "the most relevant type of boundary conditions in the modeling of constrained quantum mechanical systems is the dirichlet one while neumann boundary conditions arise mostly in the case of electromagnetic or acoustic waveguides .",
    "robin conditions are used for example in numerical simulations to model the interface between semiconductors , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the interplay between geometry and boundary conditions in waveguides has been studied in many works ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "most of them focus on the differences between neumann and dirichlet boundary . by changing the robin constant",
    "one can continuously switch from neumann to dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "for this reason we guess that the analysis carried on in this paper can help to gain a deeper understanding in this problem .",
    "let us stress that we consider only `` symmetric '' waveguides , i.e. , we take the same boundary conditions on the upper and lower boundary of the waveguide .",
    "asymmetric boundary conditions would lead to a divergent term in the transverse hamiltonian of the order of the inverse of the width of the waveguide .",
    "some results on the spectral properties of the laplacian in asymmetric waveguides can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we define the laplacian with symmetric robin boundary conditions on the waveguide and introduce the correct scaling to get a family of waveguides that collapses onto a graph . in section [ sec3 ] as preliminary results , we discuss the spectral structure of the one dimensional laplacian on a compact interval with robin boundary conditions and we recall some results on the limit of hamiltonians with short range scaled potentials taken from @xcite . after that we state the main theorem .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to the proof of the main theorem .",
    "in section [ sec5 ] we discuss the effect of small deformations of the relevant parameters of the problem . in this section",
    "we make use of the result proved in @xcite where the same problem was studied in the case of a dirichlet boundary .",
    "a section of conclusions and remarks closes the paper .",
    "the proofs of few technical estimates and of a resolvent formula that will be used to prove the main theorem are postponed in appendix [ appendice ] .",
    "let @xmath39 be a curve in @xmath40 given in parametric form by @xmath41 and let us assume that it is parameterized by the arc length @xmath14 , i.e. @xmath42 . the curve @xmath39 is completely defined up to isometries once the signed curvature @xmath43 is known @xmath44 the curvature radius of @xmath39 in @xmath14 is equal to the inverse of the modulus of the signed curvature .",

    "we want to stress an important difference between our approach and the one generically used in other works . in our setting the domain @xmath21 is defined via two characteristic lengths : the width of the waveguide @xmath126 and the range @xmath35 on which the curvature varies . since we assume that for small @xmath35 we have @xmath470 , we can make use of the adiabatic separation of the dynamics that leads in a natural way toward an analysis of the problem in two steps .",
    "the existence of two different scales of length makes it difficult to compare our model with the one generically used in the works cited in the introduction in which the scaling of the network in a neighborhood of the vertex is assumed to be isotropic .",
    "the analysis of the case @xmath471 would be of great interest because it reproduces the scaling of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the failing of the adiabatic approach makes this case much more complicated and we guess that in this setting the uniform resolvent convergence could be too demanding .    even in more complicated settings , such as graphs with three or more edges",
