    "the kontsevich  zorich cocycle is a dynamical system on the total space of the hodge bundle over the moduli space of abelian or quadratic differentials .",

    "zorich cocycle is closely related to the tangent cocycle of the teichmller flow , its lyapunov structure determines that of the teichmller flow and has implications for its dynamics .",

    "g. forni @xcite proved that , for the canonical measures on strata of _ abelian differentials _ , the exponents are all non - zero .",

    "the full kontsevich ",
    "zorich conjecture is still open for strata of nonorientable quadratic differentials .",
    "the aforementioned results lead to the natural questions as to whether or not it is possible for the kontsevich ",
    "zorich cocycle to have zero exponents with respect to other invariant measures .",
    "it is well - known to experts ( _ cf_. @xcite ) that it is possible to construct invariant measures _ for the teichmller geodesic flow _",
    "( for instance , supported on periodic orbits ) with maximally degenerate kontsevich  zorich spectra , that is , with all exponents equal to zero with the exception of the `` trivial '' ones . answering a question of w. veech , g. forni found in @xcite the first example of a @xmath0-invariant measure with a maximally degenerate spectrum .",
    "the example is given by the measure supported on the @xmath0-orbit of a genus three square - tiled cyclic cover , that is , a branched cover of the four - punctured riemann sphere , endowed with a quadratic differential with four simple poles at the punctures .",
    "any cover of this type is `` parallelogram - tiled '' in the sense that it is also a branched cover of the torus with a single branching point .",

    "later g. forni and c. matheus announced in the preprint @xcite a second example of the same kind in genus four ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the present article has , in fact , grown out of that announcement .",
    "m. mller conjectured in @xcite that these two examples are the only teichmller curves with maximally degenerate kontsevich  zorich spectra .",
    "he was able to prove his conjecture up to a few strata in genus five where the arithmetic conditions he derives to rule out maximally degenerate spectra could not be verified @xcite .",
    "mller result naturally led to the more general conjecture on whether the teichmller curves of the eierlegende wollmilchsau and the forni  matheus curve indeed give the only examples of @xmath0-invariant measures ( or even of @xmath0-orbits ) with maximally degenerate kontsevich  zorich spectra on strata of abelian differentials .",
    "for sufficiently high genus the conjecture is proved in @xcite for @xmath0-invariant suborbifolds in the moduli space of holomorphic abelian and quadratic differentials , as a corollary of the key formula for the sum of the exponents .",
    "other results in this direction for moduli spaces of holomorphic ( abelian or quadratic ) differentials in all genera have been announced by a. avila and m. mller and , independently , by d. aulicino .",
    "similar conjectures for strata of _ meromorphic _ quadratic differentials are at the moment wide open , to the authors best knowledge .    in this paper , we systematically investigate these questions within the class of all square - tiled cyclic covers .",
    "we remark that the idea of the construction of a square - tiled cyclic cover already appeared in @xcite ( and in @xcite ) but only in a particular case . here",
    "we generalize the construction and derive the main topological , geometric , and combinatorial properties of the resulting translation and half - translation surfaces .",
    "we then classify all the examples of teichmller curves derived from square - tiled cyclic covers with maximally degenerate spectra in strata of abelian holomorphic differentials and of quadratic holomorphic and meromorphic differentials .",
    "the main tool in our investigation of the spectrum of lyapunov exponents is the formula from @xcite for the sum of the non - negative lyapunov exponents ( that is , for the exponent of the determinant bundle ) .",
    "the formula takes a particularly simple , _ explicit _ form in the case of square - tiled cyclic covers .",
    "in fact , our paper can be considered as a companion to the paper by , m. kontsevich and a. zorich @xcite in which the authors derive a completely explicit formula for each individual lyapunov exponent of a square - tiled cyclic cover . in a related paper d. chen",
    "@xcite computes the lyapunov exponent of the determinant bundle for square - tiled cyclic covers by different methods and relates it to the slope of the corresponding teichmller curve .",

    "matheus example were originally found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively , by a completely different method based on the analysis of the action of the cyclic group of deck transformations on the second fundamental form of the hodge bundle ( related to the kontsevich  zorich spectrum by the variational formulas of @xcite , @xcite ) . this symmetry approach has led us to conduct a systematic investigation of the spectrum of the kontsevich ",
