    "the desire to integrate storage capabilities and information processing in single semiconductor - based devices has fueled the development of ferromagnetic semiconductors based on ( iii , mn)v materials.@xcite these materials have been the focus of intensive research over the recent years after non - equilibrium growth procedures @xcite have demonstrated the ability to achieve a ferromagnetic phase by increasing the hole - carrier concentration .",
    "holes are introduced by mn , which acts as an acceptor when substituted for a cation .",
    "the improvement in the carrier concentration is due to a decrease in the concentration of compensating defects , such as as - antisites and mn - interstitials .",
    "these defects act as donors and hence reduce the free - carrier concentration with respect to the substitutional - mn density .",
    "the donor defect concentration can be diminished even further by low temperature annealing of these materials.@xcite electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and optical measurements @xcite show that the d - electrons of the mn impurity are strongly localized with total spin @xmath0 .",
    "also , the neutral impurity state consisting of a 3d@xmath1 configuration plus a weakly bound hole is only observed experimentally for very low mn concentrations outside the doping range where ferromagnetism occurs .",
    "therefore , the holes are considered to reside in delocalized or weakly localized valence - band states .    for the doping regime where the highest conductivities are obtained ,",
    "these experimental considerations lead to a popular model starting from a hamiltonian of the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the hamiltonian describing the electronic structure of the host semiconductor , which can be limited to a given subset of the bands such as the valence bands ( holes ) , conduction bands ( electrons ) , or both , and the last two terms are the exchange coupling between the localized d - electrons and the delocalized holes ( p ) and electrons ( s).@xcite this effective hamiltonian incorporates the effects of spin - orbit coupling , which plays a very important role in the qualitative and quantitative understanding of these materials.@xcite the properties predicted by this model are most easily understood in the strongly metallic regime for which disorder in the spatial distribution of the mn@xmath4 ions and other defects of the materials can be treated perturbatively .",
    "the model can be further simplified by the mean - field approximation where usually the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) is made.@xcite disorder effects have been taken into account by the introduction of a finite quasiparticle lifetime within the born approximation . the accurate description of many thermodynamic and transport properties of metallic ( ga , mn)as samples , such as the transition temperature,@xcite the anomalous hall effect,@xcite the anisotropic magnetoresistance,@xcite the magneto - crystalline anisotropy,@xcite the spin - stiffness,@xcite the ferromagnetic domain wall widths,@xcite the magnetic dynamic damping coefficients,@xcite and the magneto - optical properties,@xcite has proven the merit of this effective hamiltonian approach and the perturbative treatment of disorder within the metallic regime .",
    "disorder effects in diluted magnetic semiconductors , including the case of strong disorder , have recently been reviewed in ref .  .",
    "optical properties are among the key probes into the electronic structure of materials . given the wide energy range that optical probes can attain , many different physical effects can be addressed by exploring the full spectrum of phenomena including the visible and infrared absorption , @xcite magneto - optical effects such as the magnetic circular dichroism,@xcite raman scattering,@xcite photoemission , @xcite , cyclotron resonance,@xcite and ellipsometry measurements    in earlier work some of us explored the theoretical predictions for the infrared magneto - optical properties of these materials within a six - band model and found them to agree quantitatively with experiments in the strongly metallic regime.@xcite with better samples and a wider spectrum now available in experiments , there is the need to explore the predictions in this broader range .",
    "hence in this paper we extend our model to the whole range from infrared to optical frequencies .",
    "we calculate the infrared and optical conductivity , as well as magneto - optical effects , for the typical level of compensation in samples measured so far@xcite as well as for the more metallic regime of optimally annealed samples , for which our theory is most suitable .",
    "we also compute the dependence of magneto - optical effects on compensation and mn concentration , which should be useful for detailed comparison with experiments , providing further insights in the validity of this model .",
    "the strong effects predicted by our calculations should motivate further experimental exploration of the complex magneto - optical effects in these materials beyond the optical regime .",
    "we use the @xmath5 or kohn - luttinger ( kl ) model@xcite to describe the carriers , which are coupled with the @xmath0 mn moments by p - d exchange treated in the mean - field approximation .",
    "@xcite we consider an eight - band ( six valence plus two conduction bands ) kl model as well as a ten - band model with additional dispersionless bands simulating the localized upper mid - gap states induced by the antisite impurities , interstitial impurities , and possibly by intra - d - shell transitions within the mn.@xcite    dynamical - mean - field - theory studies , @xcite which use a single - band model that neglects the spin - orbit coupling and the heavy - light degeneracy of a iii - v semiconductor valence band , demonstrate that non - drude impurity - band - related peaks in the frequency - dependent conductivity occur in dms ferromagnet models when the strength of the exchange interaction is comparable to the valence - band width .",
    "although these insights are useful , the conductivities predicted by this model are inconsistent with experiment in their temperature dependence and do not , by construction , incorporate strong magneto - optical effects in the mid - infrared regime which we find to be important . in a recent related investigation of the optical properties using monte carlo simulations , the transition from the valence band to a mn impurity band was studied .",
    "@xcite however these approaches miss the important multi - band structure of ( iii , mn)v which seems to be a key to understand the magneto - optical properties of these compounds in the metallic regime and the anisotropies mentioned above .",

    "( [ model ] ) .",
    "we employ an eight- or ten - band kl hamiltonian @xmath6 for the carriers in the host gaas and treat the mn local moments within mean - field theory and vca.@xcite at zero temperature this gives rise to valence and conduction bands splitting by the effective exchange fields @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the substitutional mn density and the strength of the exchange coupling between the valence ( p ) and conduction ( s ) electrons is taken to be @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively as obtained from photoemission , resistance , and magnetic - circular - dichroism ( mcd ) measurements .",
    "@xcite we assume that the magnetization is aligned along the growth ( @xmath11 ) direction by a small external magnetic field .",
    "we also restrict ourselves to the @xmath12 limit , which allows us to neglect scattering off thermal fluctuations in the orientation of mn moments .",

    "in the calculations the mn concentration @xmath15 and the free - carrier concentration @xmath16 are treated as independent parameters .",
    "compensation of the holes introduced by the mn acceptors is due to antisite and interstitial defects , as noted above .",
    "recently developed annealing procedures allow some independent experimental control over @xmath15 and @xmath16 .      in the vca ,",

    "[ fig3 ] we show the mcd signal as a function of frequency for different concentrations of carriers .",
    "the strong p - d exchange in diluted magnetic semiconductors causes the splitting of bands .",

    "in contrast to the mcd signal one observes a decrease of the kerr angle around @xmath65 with increasing hole concentration .",
    "the sharp changes of sign are again associated with different transitions within the valence subbands and the strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "from earlier studies on low - temperature gaas ( lt - gaas ) it is known that defects affect the electrical and optical properties since they interact with carriers by acting as traps or scattering and recombination centers.@xcite experiments revealed the presence of arsenic antisites , arsenic interstitials , and their complexes.@xcite usually a coulomb potential is introduced to describe effects of these charged defects .",
    "the early papers studied the dependence of the energy gap on the concentration of holes in heavily doped gaas , using a one - band model and a screened impurity coulomb potential.@xcite epr measurements in gaas showed the formation of two antisites levels @xmath83 and @xmath84 above the valence band.@xcite however , the interpretation of the mcd spectra has been controversial until recently : according to meyer _",

    "the intra - valence - band contributions are not included in the spectra shown because the low - frequency conductivity is very small for these samples , of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "exact diagonalization studies for these models show a strong suppression of the drude peak ( intraband contribution ) for `` weakly '' metallic samples due to partial localization which can not be captured by our model and hence its suppression from the spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5].@xcite from this theoretical comparison we estimate a concentration of carriers of @xmath97 and @xmath98 for mn concentration of 5.2% and 6.66% , respectively , for the samples measured by singley _",
    "et al_.@xcite moreover we find on the basis of similar fits that the compensation in as - grown samples is around 7080% .",
    "the peak around @xmath65 in optical absorption experiments and theoretical data is associated with the inter - valence - subband transitions .",

    "the experimental epr data for undoped gaas show that antisite levels lie @xmath83 and @xmath84 above the valence band.@xcite on the other hand , _ ab - initio _",
    "theory @xcite predicts interstial levels @xmath89 above the valence band",
    ". comparison of our numerical calculations with experimental data@xcite could thus suggest that the localized states near the conduction band arise from interstitials rather than from antisites .",
    "however , the discrepancy of theoretical and experimental fits near @xmath100 could also suggest a scenario with a broader impurity band or a merging of the conduction band with the impurity band .",
    "another possible scenario , suggested by photoluminescence and optical absorption experiments on gan : mn , mg @xcite and gan : fe @xcite , is that part of the upturn in the spectra in the optical range is due to intra d - shell transitions .",
