    "we reduced the data using standard iraf routines . in brief , our reduction procedure was as follows .",
    "the individual frames were overscan subtracted and cosmic rays were removed from the object frames using the routine l.a .",
    "cosmic ( @xcite ) .",
    "the spectra were then dispersion corrected , and the extracted spectra were flat - fielded , throughput corrected , and sky subtracted .",

    "individual exposures were co - added to create the final spectra used in our analysis .",
    "this follows the basic wocs rv survey procedure detailed in @xcite , except we included a cosmic ray rejection routine and summed the individual science exposures .",
    "these steps improve the quality of these low - signal spectra and reduce the rv errors discussed in section 4 .    using @xmath11 , we derived rvs from the centroid of a one - dimensional cross - correlation function ( ccf ) with an observed solar template . for the ccfs we left out regions around strong sky features ( e.g.  the sodium doublet in the first spectral setup ) and we avoided broad absorption lines ( e.g.  h@xmath0 in the second spectral setup ) .",
    "this centroid rv was converted to a heliocentric velocity and we corrected it for the unique fiber offsets of the hydra mos to obtain the final results listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "we also include in table  [ tab : rvs ] the velocity error ( see section 4 ) and height of the ccf from @xmath11 .",
    "various factors affect the precision of our rv measurements .",
    "some of these factors are intrinsic to the star , including magnitude and the broadness of the spectral lines .",

    "@xcite includes an extensive analysis of the quality of the data and rv precision for the standard wocs rv survey setup and targets .",
    "the usual rv precision values across all the stars and clusters observed as part of wocs are 0.4 to 0.5 km s@xmath2  ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rvs presented in this paper have slightly worse precision .",
    "this is because the previous wocs surveys extend to @xmath12 @xmath3 16.5 , while the ssg candidates in this paper range from @xmath12 = 17.65 to @xmath12 = 18.30 .",
    "in addition , we have measurements from two spectral setups that have not been previously used in the wocs survey , including one that has a lower resolution .",
    "we also do not apply the standard wocs requirement of a ccf peak @xmath13 0.4 .",
    "instead we include any rv measurement derived from a distinct , clear ccf peak at least 0.2 above the background noise level .",
    "currently , we can not repeat the @xmath14-analysis outlined in @xcite to quantify our rv precision because we do not have enough total observations , individual stars , or the time baseline required .",
    "however , from the analysis in @xcite for the standard wocs setup , we can extrapolate that for a @xmath12 @xmath3 18.0 star the rv precision is @xmath30.7 km s@xmath2  and for a ccf peak height of @xmath30.4 the precision is 0.9 km s@xmath2 . from this",
    "we estimate our maximum precision to be approximately 0.9 km s@xmath2 .",
    "the rv measurement errors ( rv@xmath15 ) that we list in table  [ tab : rvs ] are the errors output by @xmath11 .",
    "these errors are computed based on the fitted peak height and width , and the asymmetric noise of the ccf .",
    "we use these errors to weight our data , as error bars in figure  [ fig : ssg.plots ] , and as a guide to distinguish between binary and single star as described in the next section .",
