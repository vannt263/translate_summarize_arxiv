    "the belt is more clearly over - pressured ( by an extra factor of about 2 ) if we do not allow for a power - law component .",
    "this suggests that the belt is expanded gas from the central regions , rather than the backflow of group gas displaced by the lobes .",
    "while these scenarios would suggest different temperature structures in the belt , the errors on the temperatures are not well constrained and so we can not investigate the origin of the belt in this way .",
    "a comparison of the mass of gas in the belt with that expected in an elliptical galaxy provides a useful clue to its origin .",
    "an elliptical galaxy will typically contain a hot gaseous corona , ( @xmath41kev ) which has been accumulated through mass loss during normal stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "galactic coronae are observed to be largely unaffected by their host agn radio jets , so that conduction from the igm into the coronae must be heavily suppressed ( * ? ? ?",

    ", heating efficiencies @xmath42 by agn jets would raise the temperature of the x - ray coronal gas to that of the surrounding ambient medium , but the jets tunnel through the cool core with little interaction .",
    "coronae , therefore , have posed problems for feedback models , since they can apparently provide enough gas to fuel an agn for long periods , without being heated and swept away by the resultant radio jets .",
    "we investigate whether the belt may be a disrupted corona , the destruction of which would regulate the supply of distant gas to the central engine .",
    "s07 studied the coronae of 157 early - type galaxies , 16 of which were identified with radio - loud agn ( @xmath43whz@xmath5 ) .",

    "s09 define a dividing line between systems with large cool cores ( lcc , sources with cooling cores of cluster / group gas and a central isochoric cooling time of less than 2gyr ) and systems with galactic coronae , according to their 0.5 - 2.0kev luminosity ; @xmath63ergs@xmath5 .",
    "3c35 is beyond the s09 boundary for galaxic coronae .",
    "while our calculated @xmath64 places 3c35 in the region allowed for a lcc , the extended group environment is weak (  [ subsec : groupgas ] ) and the cooling time of the gas is much longer than 2gyr (  [ subsec : roleagnfeedback ] ) , rendering a lcc implausible .",
    "we therefore conclude that the gas belt surrounding 3c35 is not of coronal origin , as it is over - luminous for a scaled back coronal radius of 25kpc and its mass is at least an order of magnitude larger than a typical corona of a single dominant elliptical galaxy .",
    "the optical host of 3c35 has an extensive envelope , and although luminous , is not atypical for a central elliptical galaxy .",

    "an alternative interpretation of the gas belt is that it is accumulated gas lost from other galaxies in the group , or gas stripped from the host of 3c35 by surrounding group members .",

    "h07 suggest the ridge is intrinsic to the system ( rather than the interaction of the radio galaxy with the igm ) , and may have even been present before the radio source switched on .",
    "it aligns well with the local distribution of galaxies and starlight ( unaffected by the radio galaxy ) , so that a fraction of the gas in the ridge may have been stripped from the galaxies that merged to form the current host galaxy of 3c285 . a case where an active merger aligns",
    "the gas content of several galaxies orthogonal to the radio lobes is 3c442a @xcite .    to check the possibility that the gas belt in 3c35 is the combined ism from several nearby galaxies we used the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) to search for galaxies within 6 ( @xmath69kpc ) of 3c35 .",
    "a single galaxy is detected in the 2masx survey , at a separation of @xmath70 , and does not appear to be associated with 3c35 ( although there is no redshift ) .",
    "by contrast , h07 find 12 objects classified as galaxies within a @xmath70 ( @xmath69kpc ) radius of 3c285 , 6 of which are optically confirmed ( via sdss ) to be associated with membership of the group .",

    "we find the new galaxy to be about @xmath73kpc offset from 3c35 ( assuming it lies at a similar redshift ) , and at least 1.6 mag fainter .",
    "it is therefore likely to be a companion , but spectroscopic follow - up is needed to confirm this galaxy s association with 3c35 .",
    "thus , although 3c35 may be associated with a few fainter galaxies , the large magnitude difference suggests that it is relatively isolated , certainly compared to 3c285 .",
    "the potential companion galaxies of 3c35 are far too small to contribute significant gas or cause major disturbance in 3c35 s gas .",
    "if the gas belt were a ` ridge ' in the igm , we would expect to have detected an x - ray cool core in the host galaxy , due to the prevalence of such cores in radio - loud systems @xcite .",
    "we find no evidence for a cool core in the host of 3c35 (  [ subsec : core ] ) .",
    "we note that although h07 do not cite any evidence for a cool core in 3c285 , there is evidence of a recent merger that may have disrupted a cool core .",
    "a third possibility for the origin of the gas belt is that it is the residual of the expansion of fossil group gas , driven outwards by the radio lobes .",
    "radio - loud agn have been found to be prevalent in fossil group samples : @xcite find 2/3 of their fossil group sample to be radio - loud . 3c35 roughly meets the standard criteria for a fossil group .",
    "its closest companion is at least 1.6 mag fainter than 3c35 in the _ spitzer _ irac data , and 3c35 has an extensive envelope which is not well fitted , so that the two galaxies may have a total brightness difference of about 2 mag .",
    "there are no other galaxies in the field of comparable luminosity .",
    "the combination of a luminous central galaxy ( the 2mass @xmath74-band host galaxy magnitude of 3c35 of @xmath75 @xcite is within the top few percent of the h - band luminosity function for local early - types , * ? ? ? * ) with a lack of neighbouring galaxies makes this system a convincing candidate for a fossil group .",
    "fossil groups for which the temperature has been measured range from 0.66 to 4kev @xcite , consistent with the temperature we measure for the gas belt .",
    "the 1.4ghz luminosity of 3c35 is @xmath76whz@xmath5 ( only one fossil group in the hess sample is more radio luminous ) , yet the x - ray luminosity of the belt is low compared to the other fossil - group halos ( figure [ fig : santosv_lx ] , right ) .",
    "but the belt volume for 3c35 is also large ( figure [ fig : santosv_lx ] , left ) .",
    "if 3c35 s belt arises from expansion of a fossil - group atmosphere , we would expect @xmath77 , and this line is plotted in the figure .",
    "the increased luminosity of the halo for plausible expansion factors of about 10 brings the system more in line with the hess radio - loud fossil groups ( figure [ fig : santosv_lx ] , right ) .",
    "therefore , we believe the most likely explanation for the appearance of a relatively bright gas belt in such a poor environment is via the driven expansion of fossil group gas .",
    "we may be witnessing the extreme end of feedback , where the radio lobes have almost destroyed the atmosphere of a fossil group that fed the radio agn .",
    "the lobes and gas belt appear to be closely related morphologically ( fig .",
    "[ fig : imgxmm ] ) , and have likely influenced one another during their formation ; we expect comparable ages for both features . the pressure of the gas belt is higher than that of the lobes ,",
    "thus the belt is capable of having driven the radio lobes out of the central regions of the source , explaining the `` pinch '' in the contours of the radio structure between the lobes ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lobes ] ) .",
    "the pressure ratio ( see table [ table : temppressure ] ) between the gas belt and the group medium is @xmath78 . using the rankine - hugoniot conditions for a strong shock in a monatomic gas ( see  5.1 of * ? ? ?",

    "we would expect the x - ray and radio surface brightness ratios to be comparable , if the magnetic field strength and number densities of both the ic and synchrotron emitting electron populations are constant across the lobe and gas belt . in other words , in comparison with the lobes as a whole , the belt region appears to be more successful in producing power - law x - ray emission than would be expected on the basis of its radio flux .",
    "there are three possible scenarios to explain the variation of the x - ray / radio emission across the lobes and gas belt of 3c35 .",
    "( i ) another process is boosting x - ray emission from the central regions .",
    "( ii ) a population of low - energy electrons in the central regions is contributing to the ic mechanism , or ( iii ) the magnetic field strength is varying as a function of position , such that the inner lobes are more electron - dominated .    nuclear photons ( @xmath121 ) and starlight are important as extra sources of seed photons for ic scattering in some sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and could provide a boost in the non - thermal x - ray emission seen from the belt of 3c35 . inverse - compton scattering of nuclear photons should dominate at ( projected ) distances @xmath122 from the core ;    @xmath123    where @xmath124 is the isotropic nuclear luminosity ( @xmath125ergs@xmath5 ) in the fir to optical band and @xmath126 is the cosine of the angle between the radio axis and the line of sight @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath127 for 3c35 .",
    "@xcite find an upper limit on the optical luminosity of 3c35 to be @xmath128 ergs@xmath5hz@xmath5 using hubble space telescope ( hst ) data from the wide field and planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . using infrared ukirt observations of 3c35 @xcite , in four bands ( jhkl ) with fixed aperture size of 7.5",
    ", we deduce the integrated ir to optical luminosity of the core region to be @xmath129ergs@xmath5 .",
    "since the gas belt extends over 100kpc in radius , but @xmath130 , we conclude that ic scattering of nuclear photons does not contribute significantly to any power - law x - ray emission from the belt .",
    "it is also unlikely that a boost in gas - belt ic emission is due to the upscattering of starlight from faint galaxies in close proximity to 3c35 , although we can not rule out some ic emission originating from this process .",
    "scenario ( ii ) , in which differences in the electron spectrum are responsible for the variation in x - ray / radio ratio , seems favourable .",
    "a population of lower energy electrons may exist in the gas - belt region .",
    "these would raise the x - ray ic emission , but not significantly contribute to the synchrotron mechanism at 1.4ghz . a steeper electron spectrum near the core ( more older electrons ) may add an additional component of pressure to the gas belt . a typical lorentz factor for a population of electrons emitting synchrotron radiation at 1.4ghz in a fixed magnetic field of @xmath131nt is @xmath132 . in the case of cmb seed photons ,",
    "the ic emission requires electrons with @xmath19 , the less energetic end of the synchrotron emitting population .",
    "radio images of o10 ( figure 1 ) support this explanation .",
    "the emission at low frequency shows a steeper radio spectral index near the core of 3c35 : @xmath133 changes from 0.6 to 1.7 between 327mhz and 1.4ghz in the inner region of the lobes .",
    "a steeper spectrum implies more low - energy electrons near the centre of 3c35 than we estimated in ",
    "[ subsec : lobediscussion ] above .",
    "if we increase the spectral index from @xmath134 to @xmath135 , assuming the magnetic field strength measured in the lobes of @xmath136nt , we would expect to measure an increased flux at 1kev of 9.9njy .",
    "this would give a surface brightness ratio of @xmath137 .    model ( iii )",
    "postulates a variation in the magnetic field strength with position .",
    "a lower magnetic field could reduce the synchrotron emissivity in the belt , but the electron population could remain the same throughout the belt and lobe , accounting for the relatively uniform ic surface brightness . the observed x - ray and radio flux density are accounted for by ic scattering of the cmb in the belt if the magnetic field intensity is decreased to @xmath138nt ( for @xmath134 ) , a factor of about 8 lower than predicted for minimum energy .",
    "this would imply that the magnetic field strengths are closer to equipartition in the more distant regions of the lobes as compared to the inner regions .",
    "it is unlikely that magnetic field variations between the lobes and gas belt of 3c35 or a population of lower energy electrons can independently explain the uniform x - ray flux but apparent decreased radio flux across the belt and lobes of 3c35 .",
    "we speculate the most likely explanation is a combination of model ( ii ) and ( iii ) , in which differences in both the electron spectrum and magnetic field strength in the belt are responsible for the variation in emission .",
    "our fits can be explained if the electron spectrum is steepened to @xmath135 and the magnetic field is increased from the lobe value to 0.12nt in the gas - belt region .",
    "this is only a factor of @xmath139 higher than the magnetic field measured in the lobes , and about a factor of two less than predicted by a minimum - energy calculation .      in this paper , we have suggested that 3c35 is destroying the surrounding igm .",
    "we have found that the gas belt has an age comparable to that of the radio source and that the morphologies of the radio lobes and gas - belt point to co - evolution .",
    "the gas belt is unlikely to be asymmetrically aligned group gas accumulated from galaxies in the plane of the belt , as 3c35 resides in a poor environment , neither is it consistent with disrupted galactic coronal gas .",
    "we favour the argument that the gas belt is expanded fossil group gas , driven outwards by the radio lobes .",
    "we have demonstrated that the radio source is powerful enough to unbind the group gas from the central galaxy potential well , and that only 1% of the mass of the belt is required to have fuelled the radio structure .",
    "we find the pressure of the external group medium to be up to two orders of magnitude lower than the gas belt , implying the belt is an expansion of gas from the central regions , rather than a backflow of heated igm displaced by the radio lobes .",
    "however , without robust temperature measurements across the gas belt , we can not completely rule out the latter scenario .",
    "a backflow could provide fuel to the agn , continuing its outburst .",
    "this would be the type of feedback loop on scales of hundreds of kpc necessary for radio sources to respond to their large scale environments ( a weakness of feedback models has been the absence of a responsive mechanism over large distances , * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of radio - loud agn in fossil groups ( * ? ? ? * and this work ) implies these systems are not as quietly and passively evolving as previously thought .",
    "the short lifetime of radio synchrotron emission ( less than a few hundredmyr ) after the source has turned off ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) compared to the fossil group formation timescale inferred from simulations ( several gyr ) , as well as the long cooling time for the x - ray emitting gas ( @xmath140 of the gas belt is estimated as @xmath141gyr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that a reccuring process drives agn activity .",
    "the mechanisms governing the fuelling of agn , and the processes involved in turning nuclear activity on and off in these dynamically old systems , remain unclear . in 3c35",
    "it appears not to be merger - driven .",
    "we see no stucture in the @xmath142 and @xmath143 images that might support a major merger in this system for more than about 1 gyr .",
    "the optical nuclear spectrum of 3c35 @xcite is absorption - line dominated , with no sign of optical agn activity or a recent strong burst of star formation ( in the last @xmath144myr ) .",
    "a relationship between agn and their host galaxies has been well documented ( bh - bulge mass correlation , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and discussed in terms of agn - induced feedback through several proposed mechanisms ; agn - driven winds , starburst - driven superwinds , and jet - induced outflows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "agn feedback remains the most likely mechanism to balance radiative cooling of the igm in systems with large cool cores ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". there has been no clear example of feedback between radio sources hosted in fossil systems and the large scale gas in the literature .",
    "3c35 could be the first case where we are seeing the x - ray halo of a fossil group during the end phase of disruption .",
    "we have discussed the extended x - ray emission seen in new _",
    "xmm _ and archival _ chandra _ observations of the fr ii giant radio galaxy 3c35 .",
    "the properties of the lobes are consistent with earlier work ( is11 , o10 ) , and show a clear detection of inverse - compton emission .",
    "the implied departure from equipartition is comparable to the range observed in other sources .",
    "we report detections of an extended group - scale environment , and place weak constraints on the non - thermal emission from the nucleus .",
    "more importantly , we report the detection of a gas belt , orthogonal to the radio lobes and lying between the radio lobes seen in our 1.4ghz radio map .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray emission from the belt is most likely a combination of thermal and power - law emission .",
    "the thermal component is likely to be from hot gas originating in @xmath12 galaxies that merged over a gyr ago and was driven outwards by the expanding radio structure before continuing to expand at its own sound speed .",
    "the age of the radio structure of 3c35 is consistent with the lifetime of the expanded belt feature .",
    "the higher than predicted ( from 1.4ghz data ) x - ray flux of its non - thermal component is attributed to a population of low energy electrons boosting ic emission in combination with positional variation of the magnetic field .",
    "3c35 s power is sufficient to place it close to the peak of the distribution of radio power in the local universe , and thus in the critical range where radio - mode feedback should be seen @xcite , if it is indeed an important mechanism in the required regulation of structure evolution .    in order to support the mechanism being common and to determine a possible age / power / environmental dependency on the ejection of the x - ray halos of fossil groups by radio - loud agn requires a sample of potentially similar cases .",
    "we are currently investigating a sample of nine such sources ( mannering et al . in prep ) .",
