    "with the fast development of wireless communication , spectrum resources have become increasingly scarce , motivating the development of technologies such as d2d communications  @xcite to improve spectrum utilization of the crowded spectrum bands .",
    "meanwhile , as an early study by federal communications commission suggests , some of the allocated spectrum is largely under - utilized in vast temporal and geographic dimensions  @xcite .",
    "cognitive radio , focusing on these bands , has attracted wide attentions over the past years as a promising solution to the spectrum reuse  @xcite . in cognitive radio networks  ( crns ) , unlicensed secondary users  ( sus )",
    "are allowed to access spectrum bands of the licensed primary users  ( pus ) by two spectrum sharing approaches : underlay and overlay@xcite . in underlay spectrum sharing",
    ", the sus are allowed to operate if the interference caused to pus is below a given threshold with proper resource management  @xcite .",
    "overlay spectrum sharing , which is adopted in this paper , refers to the spectrum utilize technique that allows the sus to access only the empty spectrum for pus@xcite .",
    "thus , reliable identification of spectrum holes is required to protect the pus and maximize sus throughput@xcite .",
    "most existing works on overlay crns employ `` listen - before - talk ''  ( lbt ) protocol on half - duplex  ( hd ) radio , in which the traffic of sus is time - slotted , and each slot is divided into two sub - slots , namely sensing sub - slot and transmission sub - slot .",
    "sus sense the target channel in the sensing sub - slot to decide whether to access the spectrum in the following transmission sub - slot @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "optimization of sensing and transmission duration has been discussed . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered general pu idle time distributions and imperfect sensing , and provide a tight upper bound of the performance in the lbt protocol .",
    "cooperative spectrum sensing has been studied in @xcite to achieve better sensing performance . though the conventional hd based lbt protocol is proved to be effective , it actually dissipates the precious resources by employing time - division duplexing , and thus , unavoidably suffers from two major problems as follow .    1 .",
    "the sus have to sacrifice the transmit time for spectrum sensing , and even if the spectrum hole is long and continuous , the data transmission need to be split into small discontinuous slots ; 2 .",
    "during the transmission sub - slots , the sus do not sense the spectrum .",
    "thus , if the pus arrive or leave during the transmission sub - slots , sus can not be aware until the next sensing sub - slot , which leads to long collision ( when the pus arrive ) and spectrum waste ( when the pus leave ) .      a more efficient way to utilize the spectrum holes and protect",
    "the pu network should allow the sus to keep sensing the spectrum all the time .",
    "whenever a spectrum hole is detected , sus begin transmission , and once the pu arrives , the transmission ceases .",
    "this can be facilitated by full - duplex  ( fd ) techniques  @xcite . in a fd system ,",
    "a node can transmit and receive using the same time and frequency resources .",
    "however , due to the close proximity of a given modem s transmitting antennas to its receiving antennas , strong self - interference introduced by its own transmission makes decoding process nearly impossible , which had been a huge impediment to the development of fd communications in the past .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress in the self - interference cancelation including proper hardware design and signal process techniques , presenting great potential for realizing the fd communications for the future wireless networks  @xcite .    motivated by the fd techniques , in this paper",
    ", we propose a `` listen - and - talk ''  ( lat ) protocol , by which sus can simultaneously perform spectrum sensing and data transmission @xcite .",
    "we assume that the pu can change its state at any time and each su has two antennas working in fd mode .",
    "specifically , at each moment , one of the antennas at each su senses the target spectrum band , and judges if the pu is busy or idle ; while the other antenna transmits data simultaneously or keeps silent on basis of the sensing results .",
    "we remark that the ideas of this kind have also been mentioned by some other recent works@xcite .",
    "some of the papers such as @xcite have mentioned the simultaneous sensing and transmission briefly as a feasible application scenario of fd technology without further analysis , while some other papers study the similar topics .",
    "we concisely summarize them as follow .",
    "some works focus on deploying fd radios on cr users and the impact of some physical issues leading to residual self - interference and imperfect sensing @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xcite discussed the use of directional antennas , and showed that directionality of multi - reconfigurable antennas could increase both the range and rate of full - duplex transmissions over omni - directional antenna based full - duplex transmissions ; @xcite focused on comparing sensing error probabilities in the half - duplex , two - antenna full - duplex , and single - antenna full - duplex cognitive scenarios under energy detection ; and the impact of some physical issues leading to residual self - interference and imperfect sensing such as bandwidth , antenna placement error , and transmit signal amplitude difference was discussed in @xcite    in @xcite , the authors considered multiple su links with partial / complete self - interference suppression capability , and they could operate in either simultaneous transmit - and - sense  ( ts ) or simultaneous transmit - and - receive  ( tr ) modes .",
    "mode selection between the ts and tr mode and the coordination of su links were proposed to achieve high secondary throughput .",
    "the idea of the ts mode is similar to our protocol .",
    "however , in @xcite , one fixed threshold for energy detection was used in both so and ts modes , while in our work , a pair of sensing thresholds are designed to compensate for the imperfect self - interference cancelation . besides , the authors in @xcite only provided calculation of error sensing probabilities in series expressions in the analysis , and failed to present how well can the sus utilize the spectrum holes , which is addressed in our work .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered cooperation between primary and secondary systems . in their model",
    ", the cognitive base station  ( cbs ) relays the primary signal , and in return it can transmit its own cognitive signal .",
    "the cbs was assumed to be fd enabled with multiple antennas .",
    "beamforming technique was used to differentiate the forwarding signal for primary users and secondary transmission .",
    "different from all the above works , throughout the paper , we focus on the following important issues :    * how to design the sensing strategy so that the benefits of the fd can be fully enjoyed ? * how to design the secondary transmit parameter , e.g. , transmit power , so that sus can achieve high throughput as well as satisfactory sensing performance ? *",
    "how well can the proposed lat perform in terms of spectrum utilization efficiency and secondary throughput ?",
    "we explore answers to these questions by both theoretical analysis and simulation results .",
    "the main contributions of this paper can be summarized below .",
    "* we clearly present the idea of simultaneous sensing and transmission , and design a `` listen - and - talk '' protocol indicating when and with what power should a su access the spectrum , and how to set the detection threshold .",
    "* we present theoretical analysis of the sensing performance and the spectrum utilization . especially , the closed - form expressions of the collision ratio at the primary network and the spectrum waste ratio are provided .",
    "* we report a power - throughput tradeoff , show the existence of a local optimal transmit power , with which the sus can achieve high throughput as well as satisfying sensing performance , and derive the theoretical expression of the local optimal transmit power .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii describes the system model and the concept of simultaneous sensing and transmission . in section iii , we elaborate the proposed lat protocol and discuss the design of important parameters . in section iv , we investigate the analytical performance , including the spectrum utilization efficiency and secondary throughput .",
    "also , a power - throughput tradeoff is reported and analyzed .",
    "simulation results are presented to verify the analytical results in section v. we conclude the paper in section vi .",
    "in this section , the system model of the overall network is presented , and the concept of simultaneous sensing and transmission under imperfect self - interference suppression is elaborated .",
    "we consider a cr system consisting of one pu and one su pair as shown in the left part of fig .",
    "[ model ] , in which su@xmath0 is the secondary transmitter and su@xmath1 is the receiver . each su is equipped with two antennas ant@xmath0 and ant@xmath1 , where ant@xmath0 is used for data reception , while ant@xmath1 is used for data transmission .",
    "the transmitter su@xmath0 uses both ant@xmath0 and ant@xmath1 for simultaneous spectrum sensing and secondary transmission with the help of fd techniques , while the receiver su@xmath1 uses only ant@xmath0 to receive signal from su@xmath0 . )",
    "performs spectrum sensing , while the receiver  ( su@xmath1 ) does not . this transmitter - only sensing mechanism",
    "is widely adopted in today s cognitive radio , considered that secondary transmitters and receivers can not continuously exchange sensing results without interfering the primary network .",
    "besides , we assume that su@xmath1 has two antennas for fairness and generality , since su@xmath1 does not always need to be the receiver . ]    the spectrum band occupancy by the pu is modeled as an alternating busy / idle random process where the pu can access the spectrum at any time . we assume that the probabilities of the pu s arrival and departure remain the same across the time , and the holding time of either state is distributed as the exponential distribution@xcite .",
    "we denote the variables of the idle period and busy period of the pu as @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively . and let @xmath4 $ ] and @xmath5 $ ] represent the average idle and busy duration . according to the property of exponential distribution ,",
    "the probability density functions  ( pdfs ) of @xmath2 and @xmath3 can be written as , respectively , @xmath6    for sus , on the other hand , only the idle period of the spectrum band is allowed to be utilized . to detect the spectrum holes and avoid collision with the pu",
    ", su@xmath0 needs to sample the spectrum at sampling frequency @xmath7 , and make decisions of whether the pu is present after every @xmath8 samples , this makes the secondary traffic time - slotted , with slot length @xmath9 .",
    "considering the common case that @xmath7 can be sufficiently high and the state of pu changes sufficiently slowly , we assume that @xmath10 and @xmath8 is a sufficiently large integer .",
    "if we divide the pu traffic into slots in accordance with su s sensing process , the probability that pu changes its state in a stochastic slot can be derived as follows .",
    "* the pu arrives in a stochastic slot : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and we assume it to be a large integer . * the pu leaves in a stochastic slot : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is assumed to be a large integer .    note",
    "that when @xmath15 and @xmath16 are sufficiently large , we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 .      with the help of fd technique , su@xmath0 can detect the pu s presence when it is transmitting signal to su@xmath1 .",
    "however , as shown by the dotted arrow in the system model in fig .  1",
    ", the challenge of using fd technique is that the transmit signal at ant@xmath1 is received by ant@xmath0 , which causes self - interference at ant@xmath0 .",
    "note that for ant@xmath0 , the received signal is affected by the state of the transmit antenna ( ant@xmath1 ) : when ant@xmath1 is silent , the received signal at ant@xmath0 is free of self - interference , and the spectrum sensing is the same as the conventional half - duplex sensing .",
    "thus , we consider the circumstances when su@xmath0 is transmitting or silent separately .    when su@xmath0 is silent , the received signal at ant@xmath0 is the combination of potential pu s signal and noise .",
    "the cases when the pu is busy or idle are referred to as hypothesis @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "the received signal at ant@xmath0 under each hypothesis can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the signal of the pu , @xmath23 is the channel from the pu to ant@xmath0 of su@xmath0 , and @xmath24 denotes the complex - valued gaussian noise .",
    "we assume that @xmath22 is psk modulated with variance @xmath25 , and @xmath23 is a rayleigh channel with zero mean and variance @xmath26 .",
    "when su@xmath0 is transmitting to su@xmath1 , rsi is introduced to the received signal at ant@xmath0 .",
    "the received signal can be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the hypothesises under which the su is transmitting and the pu is busy or idle , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 in denotes the rsi at ant@xmath0 , which can be modeled as the rayleigh distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath31@xcite , where @xmath32 denotes the secondary transmit power at ant@xmath1 and @xmath33 represents the degree of self - interference suppression , which is commonly expressed in dbs , and indicates how well can the self - interference be suppressed .",
    "spectrum sensing refers to the hypothesis test in either or .",
    "given that su@xmath0 has the information of its own state ( silent or transmitting ) , it can automatically choose one pair of the hypothesises to test @xmath34 and decide whether the pu is present or not .",
    "in this section , we first present the proposed lat protocol , and then discuss the key parameter design in spectrum sensing to meet the constraint of collision ratio to the primary network .      the right part of fig .",
    "[ model ] shows the lat protocol , in which su@xmath0 performs sensing and transmission simultaneously by using the fd technique : ant@xmath0 senses the spectrum continuously while ant@xmath1 transmits data when a spectrum hole is detected .",
    "specifically , su@xmath0 keeps sensing the spectrum with ant@xmath0 with sampling frequency @xmath7 , which is shown in the line with down arrows . at the end of each slot with duration @xmath35",
    ", su@xmath0 combines all samples in the slot and makes the decision of the pu s presence .",
    "the decisions are represented by the small circles , in which the higher ones denote that the pu is judged active , while the lower ones denote otherwise .",
    "the activity of su@xmath0 is instructed by the sensing decisions , i.e. , su@xmath0 can access the spectrum in the following slot when the pu is judged absent , and it needs to backoff otherwise .    since the pu can change its state freely , there exist the following four states of spectrum utilization :    * state@xmath0 : the spectrum is occupied only by the pu , and su@xmath0 is silent . *",
    "state@xmath1 : the pu is absent , and su@xmath0 utilizes the spectrum .",
    "* state@xmath36 : the pu and su@xmath0 both transmit , and a collision happens . *",
    "state@xmath37 : neither the pu nor su@xmath0 is active , and there remains a spectrum hole .    among these four states ,",
    "state@xmath0 and state@xmath1 are the normal cases , and state@xmath36 and state@xmath37 are referred to as collision and spectrum waste , respectively .",
    "there are two reasons leading to state@xmath36 and state@xmath37 : ( a ) the pu changes its state during a slot , and ( b ) sensing error , i.e. , false alarm and miss detection .",
    "we adopt energy detection as the sensing scheme , in which the average received power in a slot is used as the test statistics @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the @xmath41th sample in a slot , and the expression for @xmath40 is given in and .    with a chosen threshold @xmath42 , the spectrum is judged occupied when",
    "@xmath43 , otherwise the spectrum is idle .",
    "generally , the probabilities of false alarm and miss detection can be defined as , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the hypothesises when the pu is idle and busy , respectively .",
    "considering the difference of the received signal caused by rsi , we can achieve better sensing performance by changing the threshold according to su@xmath0 s activity .",
    "let @xmath47 and @xmath48 be the thresholds when su@xmath0 is silent and busy , respectively , and we can have two sets of probabilities of false alarm and miss detection accordingly , denoted as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the most important constraint of the secondary networks is that their interference to the primary network must be under a certain level . in this article",
    ", we consider this constraint as the collision ratio between sus and the pu , defined as @xmath51$}}.\\nonumber\\ ] ] the sensing parameters are designed according to the constraint of @xmath52 . in the rest of this subsection , sensing performance is evaluated , based on which we provide the analytical design of the sensing thresholds .    * sensing error probabilities : * with the statistical information of the received signal in and , the statistical properties of @xmath38 under each hypothesis can be derived .",
    "we consider the following two types of time slots :    * _ slots in which the pu changes its state : _ if the pu arrives in a certain slot , the received signal power is likely to increase in the latter fraction of the slot , and the average signal power  ( @xmath38 ) is likely to be higher than the previous slots when the pu is absent .",
    "then the probability of correct detection is higher than @xmath53 , with @xmath54 denoting the current activity of su@xmath0 .",
    "similarly , if the pu leaves in a slot , the probability of correct detection is higher than @xmath55 .",
    "note that these slots are rare in the whole traffic , we only consider the lower limits of correct detection in these slots , i.e. , we set without further derivation the probabilities of correct detection to be @xmath53 and @xmath55 when the pu arrives or leaves , respectively . * _ slots in which the pu remains either present or absent : _ in these slots , the received signal @xmath40 in the same slot is i.i.d . , and as we assumed in section ii - a , the number of samples @xmath8 is sufficiently large . according to central limit theorem ( clt ) ,",
    "the pdf of @xmath38 can be approximated by a gaussian distribution @xmath56,\\frac{1}{n_s}\\rm var\\left[\\left|y\\right|^2\\right])$ ] .",
    "the specific statistical properties and the description under each hypothesis are given in table  [ fdgaussian ] , in which @xmath57 denotes the signal - to - noise ratio  ( snr ) in sensing , and @xmath58 is the interference - to - noise ratio  ( inr ) .",
    "detailed derivation of the distribution properties are provided in appendix a. + .properties of pdfs of lat protocol [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     based on table [ fdgaussian ] , the sensing error probabilities can be derived .",
    "* when su@xmath0 is silent and the test threshold is @xmath47 , the probability of miss detection  ( @xmath59 ) and the probability of false alarm  ( @xmath60 ) can be written as @xmath61 and @xmath62 respectively , where @xmath63 is the complementary distribution function of the standard gaussian distribution . * similarly , when su@xmath0 is transmitting with the threshold @xmath48 , the miss detection probability ( @xmath64 ) and the false alarm probability ( @xmath65 ) are , respectively , @xmath66 and @xmath67    * state transition and overall collision probability : * different from the conventional lbt protocol in hd crns where each slot is independent , in the lat protocol , the selection of sensing threshold depends on sus activity , which is instructed by the sensing result in the previous slot .",
    "thus , the state of the system in each slot is no longer independent , and the collision ratio is not only related to sensing error probabilities in each slot , but also the state in the previous slots .",
    "thus , joint consideration of the transition among all kinds of slots is necessary . since the sensing error probabilities in the slots where the pu changes its presence",
    "can be approximated by that in the other slots , in this part , we model the state transition of the system as a discrete - time markov chain ( dtmc ) , in which the system can be viewed as totally time - slotted with @xmath35 as the slot length . fig .",
    "[ transition ] shows the state transition diagram , where we denote state@xmath68 as @xmath69  ( @xmath70 ) for simplicity .",
    "the probability that the system stays in the collision state @xmath71 is @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the probability for the system staying in each state @xmath77 can be calculated considering the steady - state distribution of the markov chain : @xmath78 where @xmath79^{\\bf{t}}$ ] is the vector of steady probabilities , and @xmath80 is the state transition matrix abstracted from fig .",

    "* collision ratio : * the collision of the pu and su@xmath0 occurs in the following two kinds of circumstances : ( a ) when the pu keeps occupying the spectrum and su@xmath0 fails to detect the presence of pu s signal in the previous slot , which is depicted in fig .",

    "the collision length is @xmath35 .",
    "( b ) the certain slots in which pu arrives .",
    "su@xmath0 is very likely to be transmitting in these slots since the pu is likely to be absent in the previous ones .",
    "the occurrence probability of this circumstance is equal to the pu s arrival rate @xmath87 .    the average collision length under circumstance ( b ) , where the pu changes state , can be approximated by @xmath88 , when @xmath15 is large enough .    and the average collision length in this case can be calculated as @xmath89 where the approximation is valid when @xmath15 is sufficiently large .",
    "it is unavoidable in the lat protocol that when the pu arrives , a short head of the signal , with the length of a su s slot approximately , collides with the su s signal .",
    "combine the two circumstances , and the overall collision rate can be given by @xmath90    * design of sensing thresholds : * for the parameter design , we have a maximum allowable @xmath52 as the system constraint , and all the parameters of the sensing process should be adjusted according to @xmath52 .",
    "note that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are only related to the pu s traffic , and @xmath93 and @xmath94 are closely related via thresholds @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "thus , we actually have two independent variables of the secondary network to design to meet the constraint of @xmath52 .",

    "it is shown that when @xmath141 is smaller than 0.86 , the maximum of the left is larger than the corresponding value of the right , and will have solutions and power - throughput is likely to exist .",
    "when @xmath141 is greater than 0.85 , there may be no tradeoff between the transmit power and secondary throughput , which is verified by the thick solid line in fig .",
    "[ power_thput ] .",
    "in this section , simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed lat protocol .",
    "monte carlo simulations are performed by varying channel conditions and the pu s state .",
    "we set the default values of the simulation parameters as follow : the sample number in each slot @xmath142 , the corresponding probability that the pu arrives in a stochastic slot @xmath143 , and the probability that the pu leaves in any slot @xmath100 as @xmath144 .",
    "the constraint of collision ratio is set as 0.1 , and snr in sensing @xmath110 is assumed to be -5db .      as is shown in fig .",
    "[ power_thput ] , we consider the throughput performance of the lat protocol in terms of secondary transmit power .",
    "the solid and dotted lines represent the analytical performance of the lat protocol , and the asterisks  ( * ) denote the analytical local optimal transmit power .",
    "the small circles are the simulated results , which match the analytical performance well .",
    "the thin solid line depicts the ideal case with perfect rsi cancelation . without rsi ,",
    "the sensing performance is no longer affected by transmit power , and the throughput always goes up with the power .",
    "this line is also the upperbound of the lat performance .",
    "the thick dash - dotted , dotted and dash lines in the middle are the typical cases , in which we can clearly observe the power - throughput tradeoff and identify the local optimal power , which is calculated from . with the decrease of rsi  ( @xmath141 from -10db to -20db to -30db ) , the local optimal transmit power increases , and the corresponding throughput goes to a higher level .",
    "this makes sense since the smaller the rsi is , the better it approaches the ideal case , and the deterioration cause by self - interference becomes dominant under a higher power .",
    "according to fig .",
    "[ checksolution ] , when @xmath141 is sufficiently large   ( 0.85 in the figure ) , there exists no power - throughput tradeoff .",
    "we verify this result by the thick solid line denoting the cases when @xmath145db @xmath146 .",
    "no local optimal point can be found in this curve , and the numerical results show that the differentiation is always positive .    one noticeable feature of fig .  [ power_thput ]",
    "is that when self - interference exists , all curves approach the thin dotted line @xmath147 when the power goes up .",
    "this line indicates the case that the spectrum waste is 0.5 .",
    "when the transmit power is too large , severe self - interference largely degrades the performance of spectrum sensing , and the false alarm probability becomes unbearably high .",
    "it is likely that whenever su@xmath0 begins transmission , the spectrum sensing result falsely indicates that the pu has arrived due to false alarm , and su@xmath0 stops transmission in the next slot .",
    "once su@xmath0 becomes silent , it can clearly detect the pu s absence , and begins transmission in the next slot again .",
    "and the state of su@xmath0 changes every slot even when the pu does not arrive at all . in this case , the utility efficiency of the spectrum hole is approximately 0.5 , which is clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ power_thput ] .",
    "also , it can be seen that the larger @xmath141 is , the earlier the sensing gets unbearable and the throughput approaches the orange line .       and 1/100 , departure @xmath148 , the sample number of a slot @xmath8 is 300 , normalized secondary transmit power @xmath149db , sensing snr @xmath150db , and the rsi factor @xmath141 varies between 0.1 and 0.01.,width=345 ]    in this subsection , we use the receiver operating characteristic curves  ( rocs ) to present the sensing performance . in fig .",
    "[ roccurve ] , with the sensing snr @xmath110 fixed on @xmath151db , we have the relation between the collision ratio and spectrum waste ratio .",
    "the thick lines denote the cases when the pu changes its state very slowly , while the fine lines represent the cases when the pu changes comparatively quickly . in fig .",
    "[ roccurve ] , smaller area under a curve denotes better sensing performance .",
    "it can be seen that the thick lines are lower than the corresponding fine lines , which indicates that when the pu changes its state slowly , the spectrum holes can be utilized with higher efficiency .",
    "this is because the spectrum waste due to the state change , i.e. , re - access and departure of the pu happens less frequently .",
    "also , comparing the solid and dotted lines with the same @xmath99 , it can be found that smaller rsi leads to better sensing performance , and the impact of the rsi can be significant .",
    "it is noteworthy that the ratio of spectrum waste of the lat can be quite close to zero if the self - interference can be effectively suppressed , and the constraint of collision ratio is not too strict .",
    "however , recall the conventional listen - before - talk , the spectrum waste ratio can theoretically never be suppressed lower than the sensing time ratio in a slot .      ,",
    "in which the collision ratio is 0.1 , sensing snr @xmath152db , the normalized secondary transmit power @xmath153 varies between 10db to 20db , and the numbers of samples in a slot varies between 300 and 500 , with the probability of the pu s arrival per slot @xmath99 varies between 1/500 and 1/300 , departure probability per slot @xmath100 varies between 6/500 and 6/300.,width=345 ]    in fig .",
    "[ x_pw ] , we consider the impact of the rsi factor on the sensing performance .",
    "we fix the constraint of @xmath52 as 0.1 , and evaluate the spectrum waste ratio under various @xmath141 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ x_pw ] that with the increase of @xmath141 , the spectrum waste ratio increases from zero to approximately 0.5 .",
    "this is reasonable in the sense that with sufficiently small rsi factor , the rsi can be neglected compared with pu s signal and noise , and sus can fully utilize the spectrum holes .",
    "when the rsi factor is moderate or close to 1 , which indicates that the rsi can not be suppressed well , the secondary signal may overwhelm the pu s signal , leading to unreliability of sensing , and the sus are likely to stop communication due to false alarm .",
    "note that the asymptotic value of the spectrum waste ratio when the rsi is large is 0.5 , which is in accordance with the results in fig .",
    "[ power_thput ] .    besides",
    ", it can be seen that when the normalized power of rsi  ( @xmath154 ) ranges from approximately [ 0.1 , 10 ] , the spectrum waste ratio changes fast , and when the normalized power of rsi is below 0.1 , the waste ratio remains at a low level .",
    "this feature can be utilized to design the protocol parameters to achieve full utilization of the spectrum holes .",
    "also , when the pu s state change rate remains unchanged while the slot length enlarges , it can be seen that the sensing performance becomes better , especially at the points when the normalized power of rsi ranges from approximately [ 0.1 , 10 ] , where more samples in a slot would help improve sensing performance significantly .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a lat protocol that allows sus to simultaneously sense and access the spectrum holes .",
    "taken the impact of the residual self - interference on sensing performance into consideration , we designed an adaptively - changed sensing threshold for energy detection .",
    "spectrum utilization efficiency and secondary throughput under the lat protocol has been provided in closed - form , based on which a unique tradeoff between the secondary transmit power and the secondary throughput has been reported , i.e. , the increase of transmit power does not always yield the improvement of su s throughput , and a mediate value is required to achieve the local optimal performance .",
    "simulation results have verified the existence of the power - throughput tradeoff , and shown that the sus can efficiently utilize the spectrum holes under the lat protocol .",
    "the proposed lat protocol has the potential to allow the fd sus to fully utilize the spectrum holes , given that the sus no longer need to periodically suspend their transmission for sensing , and can react promptly to the spectrum opportunity . besides the basic model considered in this paper , the lat protocol can be readily extended to many other cr scenarios , like the multi - user and multi - channel cases . with simultaneous sensing and transmission ,",
    "the collision between multiple sus is likely to be shorten , and the performance of the whole secondary network is likely to enjoy a significant improvement .",
    "we first provide the general properties of the test statistics . given that each @xmath155 in is i.i.d . , the mean and the variance of @xmath38 can be calculated as @xmath156 = \\mathbb{e}\\left[\\left|y\\right|^2\\right];~{\\rm{var}}\\left[m\\right ] = \\frac{1}{n_s}{\\rm{var}}\\left[\\left|y\\right|^2\\right].\\nonumber\\ ] ] further , if the received signal @xmath157 is complex - valued gaussian with mean zero and variance @xmath158 , we have @xmath156 = \\sigma_y^2,\\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath159 = \\frac{1}{n_s}\\left(\\mathbb{e}\\left[\\left|y\\right|^4\\right]-\\sigma_y^4\\right)=\\frac{\\sigma_y^4}{n_s}.\\ ] ]    then we consider the concrete form of the received signal under each hypothesis . in the lat protocol ,",
