    "one of the firsts models which present topological defects was investigated by nielsen and olesen @xcite several years ago . in their analysis",
    "topologically stable solutions named vortices , appears as a consequence of spontaneous breakdown of local abelian and non - abelian gauge symmetries in a classical field theory .",
    "these solutions correspond to infinitely long objects which carry magnetic fluxes .",
    "later , garfinkle investigated the abelian model considering its influence on the geometry of the spacetime @xcite .",
    "he found , as in flat spacetime , static cylindrically symmetric solutions representing vortices .",
    "he also shown that asymptotically the spacetime around the cosmic string is a minkowiski one minus a wedge .",
    "its core has a non - zero thickness , and the magnetic field vanishes outside of it .",
    "two years later linet @xcite obtained , under some specific condition , exact solution for the metric tensor .",
    "he was able to show that the structure of the respective spacetime corresponds to a conical one , with the conicity parameter being expressed in terms of the energy per unity length of the vortex .",
    "the complete analysis about the behavior of the gauge and matter fields near the cosmic string s core can only be obtained numerically .",
    "some recent numerical analysis @xcite about the structure of supermassive cosmic strings show that two different kind of solutions for the metric tensor exist .    a complete analysis about the behavior of a charged field in the neighborhood of a @xmath5gauge cosmic string ,",
    "must take into account not only the influence of the geometry of the spacetime but , also , the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "two distinct cases can be analysed : @xmath6 the first one is to consider the string as an idealized infinitely thin linear topological defect , having a magnetic field running along it .",
    "this case can be treated analytically .",
    "@xmath7 the second approach is to consider the non - zero thickness for the string .",
    "analytically this problem becomes intractable .",
    "an intermediate approach is what we shall adopt here .",
    "we shall use an approximated model considering the spacetime produced by the string as being conical everywhere , but having a magnetic field inside a tube of non - zero thickness surrounding it . in this way some improvement is introduced when compared with the ideal case .",
    "moreover , we shall admit specifics spatial behaviors for the magnetic field inside the tube trying to approach the real situation .",
    "the vacuum polarization effects due to a magnetic field confined in a tube of finite radius in minkowski spacetime has been first analysed by serebryanyi @xcite .",
    "a few years later this effect in a charged massless scalar field on a idealized cosmic string spacetime , has been calculated by guimares and linet @xcite .",
    "there a magnetic flux running through the line singularity was considered . as a consequence the renormalized vacuum expectation value associated with the energy - momentum tensor , @xmath8 , presents a contribution coming from the geometry of the spacetime and the magnetic flux . in order to obtain this result",
    "the respective green function was determined . in a particular choice of gauge , this green function depends explicitly on the factor @xmath9 , the fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux @xmath10 by the quantum flux , @xmath11 .",
    "more recently sriramkumar @xcite has calculated the vacuum fluctuation of current and energy densities for a massless charged scalar field around an idealized cosmic string carrying a magnetic flux . his approach to obtain the green function takes into account the presence of the vector potential in the differential operator , @xmath12 , which presents the advantage to calculate the two - points function without imposing any additional boundary condition on the field .",
    "also the vacuum polarization associated with massless scalar field in a infinitely thin cosmic string embedded in a randall - sundrum type @xmath13 brane world , has been calculated @xcite . in lowest order of perturbation , @xmath14 , consists of two parts .",
    "the first one depends only on the conicity parameter and the second is a correction which depends on the parameter @xmath15 connected with the cosmological constant .",
    "allen , kay and ottewill @xcite have analyzed the vacuum polarization effect of a massless scalar field on a realistic cosmic string spacetime , considering generically the effect of the string s core through the non - minimal coupling between the scalar field with the geometry : @xmath16 , being @xmath17 the ricci scalar and @xmath18 the coupling constant . in this case the respective green function presents two parts : the first one , named `` regular '' by the authors , coincides with the usual one obtained in the literature for an idealized cosmic string , see @xcite for example .",
    "the second contribution comes from the nonzero core s radius of the string .",
    "although the radius of the cosmic string s core is very small , cm . ]",
    "the effect of this finite thickness on the vacuum polarization of a massless scalar field , is a long - range effects .",
    "moreover it is of the same order of magnitude as contribution coming from the geometry up to distance from the cosmic string that exceed the radius of the observable universe .",
    "motivated by this result we raised a question about the consequence on the vacuum polarization of a charged massless scalar filed in the @xmath5gauge cosmic string spacetime considering this string surrounded by a magnetic filed confined in a tube of finite radius .",
    "as in the allen _",
    "et al _ paper , we expect some consequence of the finite thickness of the tube on the vacuum polarization effect . in order to investigate this subject we decided in this paper , for simplicity , to analyse the behavior of a quantum charged massless scalar field in a idealized cosmic string spacetime , considering the presence of a infinitely long tube of finite radius @xmath2 of magnetic field .",
    "three distinct cases were taking into account : + _ i ) _ a homogeneous magnetic field inside the tube , + _ ii ) _ a magnetic field proportional to @xmath0 inside and + _ iii ) _ a magnetic field on a cylindrical shell .",
    "+ in all these three cases the axis of the infinitely long and straight tube coincides with the cosmic string .    the idealized model for a infinitely long straight static cosmic string spacetime can be given in cylindrical coordinates by the line element below : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a parameter smaller than unity which codify the presence of a conical two - surface @xmath21 .",
    "in fact for a typical grand unified theory , @xmath22 .",
    "( here we considered that this cosmic string is lying along the @xmath23-direction . )    a magnetic field along the @xmath23-direction can be represented by @xmath24 .",
    "now assuming that the field has a finite range in the radial coordinate , we are particularly interested in the three models below : @xmath25 where @xmath2 is the radial extent of the tube , and @xmath10 is the total flux .",
    "the ratio of the flux by the quantum flux @xmath26 , can be expressed by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the integer part and @xmath29 and gyromagnetic @xmath30 particle in a field of a magnetic string . ]    considering both effects , due to the geometry of the spacetime and the finite thickness of the tube of magnetic field on the vacuum polarization of a charged massless scalar field , we observe that there appear two distinct contributions for each case : for the cases @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the firsts ones are due to the geometry and the magnetic flux .",
    "they are similar to the result found by guimares and linet @xcite .",
    "the seconds contributions are due the nonzero radius of the tube , @xmath2 . the latter present similar dependence with the radial coordinate . in fact",
    "their dependence on the ratio @xmath33 is of power type besides an overall @xmath34 dependence .",
    "these results indicate that the detailed information about the structure of the magnetic field inside the tube is not so relevant .",
    "the third case is completely different from the others .",
    "the second contribution to the vacuum polarization is now very similar to the result obtained in @xcite .",
    "it presents a logarithmic dependence on the radial coordinate , being a long - range contribution .    taking into account that the topological defects are of evident physical interest ( they are considered as good candidates to explain some components of anisotropy on the cosmic microwave background @xcite , gamma ray burst @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite and highest energy cosmic ray @xcite ) it seems reasonable to investigate the above mentioned problem in more detail .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section @xmath13",
    ", we explicitly calculate the green functions associated with this system for the three different models .",
    "having now these green functions , in section @xmath35 we explicitly calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation values , @xmath3 , in complete form . using a judicious criteria of approximation we present the behavior for these quantities . in section @xmath36 , we calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum operator , @xmath4 . using the same procedure as in the previous section we present a approximated expressions for these results .",
    "we leave for section @xmath37 our conclusions and most relevant remarks about this paper .",
    "finally we want to say that we shall use in this paper @xmath38",
    "the green function associated with a charged massless scalar field must obey the non - homogeneous second order differential equation below @xmath39g(x , x^{'})=-\\delta^{(4)}(x - x ' ) , \\label{5}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 .    because it is easier to calculate the vacuum average of the square of the field and the energy - momentum tensor operators using the euclidean version of the green function ,",
    "let us solve the above equation adopting the euclidean extension of the cosmic string metric tensor given in ( [ 1 ] ) , by performing a wick rotation @xmath41 .",
    "now if we want to represent a magnetic field along the @xmath23-direction , the four - vector potential reads @xmath42 so the equation ( [ 5 ] ) becomes @xmath43g(x , x')= \\nonumber\\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\alpha r}\\delta(\\tau-\\tau')\\delta(r - r')\\delta(\\theta-\\theta ' ) \\delta(z - z ' ) \\ .",
    "\\label{7}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , in order to reproduce the magnetic fields configurations given by ( [ 2])-([4 ] ) , we have only to write the third component of the vector potential by @xmath44    for the two firsts models , we can represent the radial function @xmath45 by : @xmath46 with @xmath47 for the third model , @xmath48 due to the cylindrical symmetry of this system the euclidean green function can be expressed by @xmath49    before to specialize on the specific model let us write down the non - homogeneous differential equation obeyed by the unknown function @xmath50 . substituting ( [ 11 ] ) into ( [ 7 ] ) and using the standard representation to the delta functions in the temporal , angular and @xmath23-coordinates , we arrive to following differential equation for the function @xmath51 : @xmath52g_{n}(r , r')=-\\frac1{\\alpha r}\\delta(r - r ' ) \\ , \\label{12}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .",
    "so , all the informations about the magnetic field , the radius of the cylindrical tube and the conicity of the spacetime are contained in @xmath50 .",
    "however , before to obtain specific solution , corresponding to specific model of magnetic field , some general properties must be satisfied by this function .",
    "let us define by @xmath54 the solution of ( [ 12 ] ) regular at @xmath55 , and by @xmath56 the solution that vanishes at infinity .",
    "these two solutions must satisfy the continuity condition at @xmath57 , with their first derivative discontinuous at this point .",
    "it is of our main interest to investigate the vacuum polarization effect for external points to the magnetic flux . as we shall see , because the information about the field in this region must taking into account , the above mentioned effect will present contribution coming from the inner region . now , let us consider solutions of ( [ 12 ] ) with both @xmath58 and @xmath59 greater than @xmath2 .",
    "let us first consider the models ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) . the inner solution , @xmath54 , of ( [ 12 ] ) , corresponds to @xmath60 .",
    "however two regions must be considered separately : from @xmath61 to @xmath2 and from @xmath2 to @xmath62 . integrating out in region @xmath63",
    ", we have : @xmath64 where @xmath65 being @xmath66 @xmath67 , for @xmath68 , represents the solution associated with the two firsts models : @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , and @xmath72 with @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .    in both definitions",
    "above , eq.s ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) , @xmath76 , represents the whittaker function @xcite .",
    "the continuity condition of @xmath77 and its first derivative at @xmath78 , allow us to obtain the ratio @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 only : @xmath81 in all the expressions , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the modified bessel functions .    the outer solution of ( [ 12 ] )",
    "is given by @xmath84    all the above constants are determined by imposing the boundary conditions explained before on @xmath85 and @xmath86 at @xmath57 . in this way",
    "they will be function of @xmath59 .",
    "finally we obtain the result to the complete radial green function below : @xmath87 in the above equation @xmath88 @xmath89 is the bigger ( smaller ) value between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . substituting this solution into ( [ 11 ] ) and after some intermediate steps , the euclidean green function acquires the following expression : @xmath90}{\\cosh(u_0/\\alpha)-\\cos\\delta\\theta } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{4 \\pi^{2}}\\int_0^{\\infty } d\\beta \\beta j_{0}\\left(\\beta\\sqrt{(\\delta   \\tau)^{2}+(\\delta z)^{2}}\\right)\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}e^{i n\\delta\\theta}d^i_n(\\beta r)k_{|\\nu|}(\\beta r)k_{|\\nu|}(\\beta r ' ) , \\label{19}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91    we can observe that the first term of the above green function is , up to a gauge transformation , equivalent to the result presented by guimares and linet @xcite for the massless scalar field .",
    "the second term presents , besides the dependence on the @xmath20 parameter and the magnetic flux , a dependence on the radius @xmath2 of the tube through the constant @xmath92 .",
    "moreover , this green function obeys the boundary condition @xmath93 , which is a consequence of having used explicitly the vector potential in the differential equation ( [ gr ] ) .",
    "although we have calculated this green function for points outside the magnetic tube , there remains contributions coming from this region that do not disappear by taking @xmath94 and @xmath95 .    as to the third model ,",
    "the solution to @xmath51 is : @xmath96 and @xmath97    once more , the complete solution to this radial function can be obtained adopting a similar procedure as the previous case .",
    "this solution is :    @xmath98    again imposing the continuity condition on ( [ 21 ] ) and its first derivative at @xmath78 we get @xmath99 as function of @xmath80 : @xmath100    finally adopting similar procedure as in the previous case , we obtain : @xmath101 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac1{4 \\pi^{2}}\\int_0^{\\infty } d\\beta \\beta j_{0}\\left(\\beta\\sqrt{(\\delta   \\tau)^{2}+(\\delta z)^{2}}\\right)\\times \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty e^{in\\delta\\theta } d_n(\\beta r)k_{|n|/\\alpha}(\\beta r)k_{|n|/\\alpha}(\\beta r ' ) \\ .",
    "\\label{24}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for this case we can see that the first term in this green function coincides with results found by smith @xcite and by linet in @xcite for a massless scalar field",
    ". moreover , the second term contains the information about the radius of the tube through the constant @xmath102 .    so having the green functions our next steps will be the calculations of the vacuum expectation values associated with the modulus of the scalar field and its energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in this section we want to calculate the renormalized vacuum expectation values associated with the modulus square of the scalar field in this physical system for the three distinct configurations of magnetic fields . as we shall see",
    "these vacuum average will depend on the conicity parameter @xmath20 , the fractional part of @xmath103 and the radius of the tube , @xmath2 .",
    "because the two firsts models present similar green functions , we shall develop initially the calculations considering these two models together and later the third one .",

    "a very interesting aspect of these green functions is that the correction due to the magnetic tube s radius is finite in the coincidence limit ; so the result is : @xmath108 \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac1{(2\\pi)^{2}}\\int_0^{\\infty } d\\beta \\beta \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty d^i_n(\\beta r)k^{2}_{|\\nu|}(\\beta r ) .",

    "however there remains an extra radial dependence on the integrand through the coefficient @xmath112 .",
    "so the complete information about the second term can only be obtained numerically specifying the ratio @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath113 an approximated behavior can be exhibited if we analyse the integrand of ( [ 26 ] ) .",
    "near the origin @xmath114 behave as @xmath115 , on the other hand @xmath116 present a dependence @xmath117 as we shall see later .",

    "our approximation consists to substitute into ( [ 26 ] ) , the expression ( [ 27 ] ) to the coefficients @xmath139 .",
    "in fact doing this other contributions given by the complete expression ( [ 23 ] ) are missing ; only the first order in the expansion was kept . in order to be sure that our approximation is a good one , we also analysed numerically the integrand of the second contribution of ( [ 26 ] ) using the exact expression ( [ 23 ] ) and the approximated result ( [ 27])-([31 ] ) for the coefficients for both cases @xmath140 and @xmath13",
    ". for simplicity only we take in the summation @xmath141 , for both cases .",
    "this approximation is once more justified by the figures @xmath142 and @xmath143 which exhibit comparatively the integrand of ( [ 26 ] ) written in terms os the new variable @xmath119 , @xmath144 , for the models @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively , considering the complete expressions for the coefficients and their respective approximations .",
    "we can see a good agreement between both curves for each case .",

    "so accepting this fact as general , our final result to the vacuum polarization effects becomes : @xmath151 \\left(\\frac{r}{r } \\right)^{2\\gamma/\\alpha}\\right\\ } \\ .",

    "after this discussion about the two firsts models , let us analyze the third one where the respective green function is given by ( [ 24 ] ) .",

    "although the physical system that we are analysing is completely different from the one analyzed by bruce allen _ et al _ in @xcite , there appears a strong similarity between our result with theirs . again",

    "vanishes for @xmath175 and grows less slowly than @xmath122 for large @xmath119 .",
    "so , finally they conclude that ( [ 40 ] ) can be well approximated discarding the term @xmath177 .",
    "( also a numerical analysis in their paper supports this approximation . )    here in our case a similar conclusion can be reached . in fact choosing @xmath178 , @xmath141 and @xmath153 , @xmath179 in of order than @xmath180 for @xmath181 , so @xmath182 .",
    "consequently the pole occurs in the region where the approximation is no longer valid .",
    "we shall not repeat their argument to accept the same approximation procedure ; however we present in fig . @xmath13 a numerical evaluation of this approximation , comparing the integrand of the second contribution of ( [ 35 ] ) using the exact expression to its more relevant term , @xmath173 , given by ( [ 23 ] ) and its approximated expression given in ( [ 40 ] ) , discarding the @xmath177 term .",

    "now we have @xmath225 which is the result for the renormalized vacuum expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor associated with a massless scalar field on a idealized cosmic string spacetime @xcite .",
    "this result , together with ( [ 35 ] ) , seem very curious , because although we are considering a charged field in the presence of a cylindrical shell of magnetic field , differently from the two previous cases , the electromagnetic effect appears only on the seconds terms for both calculations ; moreover this effect is of long - range type .    finally , substituting ( [ 38 ] ) into ( [ 54])-([56 ] ) , taking into account the same considerations to overcome the integral problem on vacuum expectation value of the square of the scalar field",
    ", we obtain : @xmath226    it is easy to see that this result is traceless when @xmath219 as conformal invariance demands on this spacetime ; however as notice by bruce allen _ et al _ for @xmath227 , ( [ 59 ] ) presents a small violation of the conservation condition , which vanishes for @xmath185 , or @xmath228 . being @xmath229 , the energy density associated with a massless scalar charged field in this spacetime presents a long - range corrections arising from the magnetic field . for realistic models where the parameter @xmath20 is very close to the unity",
    "this correction becomes even more relevant than the contribution coming from the geometry itself up to distance of the order the radius of the observable universe .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the vacuum polarization effects of a charged massless scalar field due to the locally flat cosmic string spacetime and a magnetic flux confined on a tube .",
    "three distinct configurations of magnetic flux have been considered . among them",
    ", the cylindrical shell of @xmath1-function field presents a long - range effect on the vacuum polarization .",
    "in general , the results obtained to @xmath4 as to @xmath3 , outside the tube , present corrections due to the magnetic tube which vanish when we take @xmath230 or @xmath185 .    specifically speaking about the trace anomaly",
    ", it is well known that @xcite @xmath231 where @xmath232 presents contributions coming from the geometry of the spacetime as well as contribution from the gauge field strength @xcite .",
    "however because the spacetime under consideration is locally flat , and the region of our interest has no magnetic field we have @xmath233 .",
    "we conclude this paper by mentioning the importance to consider a finite structure of the magnetic flux on the quantum aspects of a charged field on an abelian cosmic string spacetime .",
    "although the complete knowledge about this structure could not be very well understood , its influence on the vacuum polarization effect can be even more relevant than the influence of geometry itself .",
