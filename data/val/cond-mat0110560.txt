    "percolation  @xcite has been of tremendous interest to diverse scientific disciplines for more than two decades .",
    "on one hand , the percolation problem is almost trivially simple to state , on the other hand , it has an abundance of fascinating features .",
    "although percolation is purely geometric in nature , it reflects many of the concepts of critical phenomena .",
    "the percolation transition is the prototype of a geometrical phase transition . in this respect ,",
    "the role of percolation may be compared to that of the ising model in conventional critical phenomena . to date",
    ", percolation represents one of the best studied areas of statistical physics and yet it is a highly vivid and fascinating area of modern research .",
    "directed percolation ( dp )  @xcite is an anisotropic variant of ordinary isotropic percolation ( ip ) in which an effect or activity can percolate only in a given preferred direction .",
    "if the preferred ( longitudinal ) direction is viewed as time , dp can be interpreted as a dynamic process . in the dynamic interpretation",
    ", dp represents one of the most prominent universality classes of nonequilibrium phase transitions : the dp universality class is the generic universality class for phase transitions between an active and an absorbing inactive state  @xcite .    perhaps , dp is the simplest model resulting in branching self - affine objects .",
    "it has many potential applications , including fluid flow through porous media under gravity , hopping conductivity in a strong electric field  @xcite , crack propagation  @xcite , and the propagation of surfaces at depinning transitions in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is related to epidemics with recovery  @xcite and self - organized critical models  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss multifractality  @xcite in dp .",
    "the notion of multifractality describes the situation that an exhaustive characterization of the distribution of a local physical quantity requires the introduction of an infinite set of independent critical exponents .",
    "this means that the distribution is not controlled by a single or several length scales , but rather by an infinite hierarchy of such .",
    "systems in which multifractality has been observed include turbulence  @xcite , diffusion near fractals  @xcite and polymers  @xcite , electrons in disordered media  @xcite , polymers in disordered media  @xcite , random ferromagnets  @xcite , chaotic dissipative systems  @xcite , and heartbeat  @xcite .",
    "since the 1980s several publications have appeared that have addressed multifractality in ip by studying random resistor networks ( rrns )  @xcite .",
    "a rrn is a simple bond percolation model on a @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice where bonds between nearest neighboring sites are occupied with probability @xmath2 with a resistor or empty with probability @xmath3 . in a typical setup one",
    "has two leads positioned at two connected lattice sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 at which a fixed external current @xmath6 is injected and , respectively , extracted .",
    "it is well established that the distribution of bond currents in rrn is multifractal .",
    "this multifractality is accessible by experiments or simulations via the moments of the distribution that are [ up to technical details , cf .",
    "( [ multimoment ] ) ] given by @xmath7 here @xmath8 denotes the current flowing through bond @xmath9 and the sum is taken over all bonds .",
    "some of these multifractal moments are corresponding to quantities that have a particularly prominent role in percolation theory .",
    "for example , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are proportional to the number of bonds on the backbone ( bonds which carry nonzero current ) , the total resistance , the noise ( second cumulant of the resistance fluctuations ) , and the number of the red bonds ( bonds which carry the full current ) . at the percolation transition ,",
    "the moments are described by a power law in the separation between the leads , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the correlation length exponent of the ip universality class .",
    "the @xmath16 are referred to as multifractal exponents .",
    "the multifractality of the current distribution manifests itself in the fact that the @xmath16 , when understood as a function of the index @xmath17 , are not related to each other in a linear or affine fashion .    to our knowledge",
    "the issue of multifractality in dp has not been addressed hitherto . here , we present such a study . by employing our real world interpretation of feynman diagrams  @xcite as well as our concept of master operators  @xcite , we find that the moments of the current distribution in dp are governed by a family @xmath18 of multifractal exponents analogous to @xmath19 .",
    "for example , if the multifractal moments are measured in the preferred time - like direction between two leads at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then we find that @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the longitudinal correlation length exponent of the dp universality class .",
    "we calculate the family @xmath18 to second order in an @xmath24-expansion about the upper critical dimension 5 .",
    "brief account of our results has been given in ref .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present our work in some detail .",
    "its remainder is organized as follows : section  [ model ] is devoted to modeling issues .",
    "we start by briefly reviewing random resistor diode networks and ohm s and kirchhoff s laws .",
    "then , static noise is introduced in the networks and corresponding noise cumulants are defined .",
    "these noise cumulants are important because they are closely related to the multifractal moments that are not accessible by our methods directly .",
    "then , we set up a generating function for the noise cumulants by employing the replica trick .",
    "the replication leads to an effective hamiltonian that we refine into a field theoretic landau - ginzburg - wilson functional @xmath25 .",
    "we conclude sec .",

    "its main content is the calculation of the generating function for the noise cumulants by employing renormalized field theory .",
    "it starts with determining the diagrammatic elements of our perturbation calculation upon recasting @xmath25 into the form of a dynamic functional .",
    "next , we demonstrate how we incorporate the dangerously irrelevant noise couplings into our diagrammatic calculation via operator insertions .",
    "we show that the operators associated with the noise cumulants are master operators .",
    "we derive the scaling behavior of the generating functions .",
    "then , the scaling behavior of the noise cumulants and multifractal moments is readily extracted via taking derivatives . finally , our result for @xmath18 is stated and several consistency checks are provided .",

    "technical details are relegated to two appendices .",
    "our approach is based on a model which captures both , ip and dp , _ viz . _ the random resistor diode network ( rdn ) introduced by redner  .",
    "we start by reviewing substantial features of the rdn .",
    "a rdn consists of a @xmath1-dimensional hypercubic lattice in which nearest - neighbor sites are connected by a resistor , a positive diode ( conducting only in a distinguished direction ) , a negative diode ( conducting only opposite to the distinguished direction ) , or an insulator with respective probabilities @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . the three dimensional phase diagram ( pictured as a tetrahedron spanned by the four probabilities ) comprises a nonpercolating and three percolating phases . the percolating phases are isotropic , positively directed , or negatively directed . between the phases",
    "there are surfaces of continuous transitions .",
    "all four phases meet along a multicritical line , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 . on the entire multicritical line ,",

    "we suppose that the directed bonds obey the non - linear generalization of ohm s law @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the voltage drop over the bond between sites @xmath36 and @xmath35 and @xmath40 denotes the current flowing from @xmath36 to @xmath35 . in the following we drop the subscript @xmath41 whenever there is no risk of confusion .",
    "the bond conductances @xmath42 are equally and independently distributed random variables .",
    "the @xmath43 take on the values @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 with respective probabilities @xmath2 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",

    "we point out that the round brackets in eq .",
    "( [ avoid ] ) contain the functional argument of the bond conductance .",
    "because the bond conductance depends on the voltage drop over that bond only via a heaviside function and @xmath53 we may write @xmath54 .",

    "of course we are not primarily interested in any particular random configuration @xmath73 of the diluted network but rather in an average @xmath74 over all these configurations .",
    "this average , however , requires a little caution because the resistance between sites not connected by any conducting path is infinite .",
    "therefore , we will exclusively consider those sites @xmath4 and @xmath5 known to be connected by such a path . in practice",
