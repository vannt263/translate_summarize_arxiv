    "the increasing amount of data on abell 1689 , a cluster of galaxies at z= 0.183 , has recently motivated several detailed analyses of its dynamical status and mass distribution . as the largest known gravitational lensing object",
    "it has been studied in detail by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2005a , 2005b ) who found that the inferred mass distribution is much steeper compared to what is expected for dark matter haloes forming in currently available cosmological @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "in particular they find the concentration parameter of the best - fitting nfw ( navarro , frenk & white 1997 ) profile of the cluster to be between @xmath2 and @xmath3 depending on projected radius to which the mass distribution was studied .",
    "the smaller value was obtained from the strong lensing results in the inner part of the cluster , while the larger value was found when the study was extended to a scale of 2 mpc using the results from weak lensing .",
    "the larger value seems rather high for the estimated mass of @xmath4 compared to the expected value of @xmath5 for haloes of this mass as found in cosmological @xmath1-body simulations ( e.g. bullock et al .",
    "the discrepancy has led oguri et al .",
    "( 2005 ) to claim that the mass distribution in a1689 may be in conflict with the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenarios for structure formation .",
    "they have shown that the disagreement can be partially reduced if the uncertainties in the parameter estimation due to the possible triaxiality of the halo are properly taken into account .",
    "the x - ray data for abell 1689 obtained with the xmm - newton telescope have been analyzed by andersson & madejski ( 2004 ) .",
    "the x - ray gas surface brightness distribution appears rather regular and smooth .",
    "however , a closer inspection reveals that the gas temperature profile is highly asymmetric and the gas mass fraction is lower than usual , which may point towards a perturbed structure .",
    "moreover , the total mass inferred from the x - ray analysis gives a value twice as small as that found from gravitational lensing .",
    "kinematical analysis of the cluster galaxies shows even larger discrepancies .",
    "the redshift survey performed by teague , carter & gray ( 1990 ) led to the identification of a few structures along the line of sight and an estimate of 2355 km s@xmath6 for the velocity dispersion of the cluster members .",
    "struble & rood ( 1999 ) estimate the cluster dispersion to be 1989 km s@xmath6 using the same data .",
    "girardi et al .",
    "( 1997 ) applied the wavelet analysis to the same data and detected even more substructure .",
    "although their estimate for the main cluster velocity dispersion was 1429 km s@xmath6 , they calculated the mass by adding the masses of two main substructures with low velocity dispersions of the order of 300 - 400 km s@xmath6 which led to the value of about @xmath7 , an order of magnitude lower than the mass obtained from the lensing studies .",
    "in this letter we reanalyze the velocity distribution of galaxies in the field of a1689 using the larger sample now available .",
    "we confirm that the cluster indeed has a complex structure in velocity space , strongly indicating the presence of dynamically independent structures along the line of sight . by imposing different cut - offs in velocity",
    "we show how the cluster mass estimate can change by a large factor , which illustrates the difficulty in inferring it from the kinematical data .",
    "the complicated mass distribution around the cluster may also affect mass estimates done with other methods .",
    "we refer to cosmological @xmath1-body simulations in order to demonstrate that distant haloes positioned along the line of observations can indeed produce line - of - sight velocity distributions similar to the one in a1689 .",
    "therefore any estimate of concentration for an object in such environment may be biased by an error not associated with the method of mass determination but due to the presence of foreground and background structures .",
    "we have searched the ned database for galaxies with redshifts @xmath8 and located at distances smaller than 2 mpc from the cluster centre assumed to be at ra=@xmath9 , dec=@xmath10 ( j2000 ) .",
    "it corresponds to the position of the elliptical galaxy closest to the centre of the main structure detected by girardi et al .",
    "it is also within 100 kpc from the centre of x - ray gas surface brightness distribution .",
    "the redshift data for galaxies thus chosen come mainly from surveys by teague et al .",

    "the data points were calculated with 30 galaxies per bin and assigned standard sampling errors ( see okas & mamon 2003 ) .",
    "the profiles can be used as a quantitative measure of the mass of the structure . assuming that the galaxies trace the overall nfw mass distribution in the cluster and have isotropic orbits we can estimate the parameters of the nfw profile , the virial mass @xmath18 and concentration @xmath19 by fitting the velocity dispersion data to the solutions of the jeans equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the 3d and the surface distribution of the tracer as a function of a true ( @xmath23 ) and projected ( @xmath24 ) distance from the object centre respectively and @xmath25 is the radial velocity dispersion related to the mass distribution in the object ( see okas & mamon 2001 , 2003 ) .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section we make use of the @xmath1-body simulations to study the origin of complex velocity distributions like the one in a1689 . for this work we used the results of a cosmological dark matter simulation described by wojtak et al .",

    "the final output of the simulation contained a few tens of massive haloes found with standard fof procedures . to mimic observations we place an imaginary observer at a given distance from the halo and project the particle velocities along the line of sight and their positions on the surface of the sky . among the most massive haloes we chose one with a similar line - of - sight velocity distribution as is seen in a1689 .",

    "[ a1689vp ] for a1689 .",
    "the @xmath36 diagram in the upper left panel is highly irregular with particle velocities spread out over the whole velocity range and making it difficult to decide which of them should be treated as true members of the halo .",
    "a distinct structure is seen at about @xmath37 km s@xmath6 which is even better visible in the upper right panel showing the line - of - sight velocity histogram .",
    "as for a1689 we separate the particles using the velocity criterion ; those with @xmath38 km s@xmath6 are marked with black dots in the plots while those with @xmath39 km s@xmath6 with green or blue dots depending on the sign of the velocity .",

    "the results for different samples are listed in table  [ par ] .",
    "as we can see , the estimated parameters differ dramatically depending on the sample . for the sample with @xmath38 km s@xmath6 the virial mass is @xmath40 ( at 68 per cent confidence level ) which agrees well with the mass @xmath41 known from the 3d information about the halo .",
    "the concentration proves more difficult to estimate with such a small sample and simple modelling since we get @xmath42 ( at 68 per cent c.l . ) which does not include the true value @xmath43 .",
    "= 8.0 cm    what is the reason behind the complicated velocity structure of the halo ?",
    "the actual spatial distribution of the particles in a part of the observed region is shown in projection in fig .",
    "the centre of our halo is located at @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "the line of sight of the observer is along the @xmath46 axis of the plots .",
    "the second , smaller halo of mass @xmath47 contributing to the @xmath36 diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ halo6vp ] is located at the distance of 45 mpc from the main halo .",
    "as before , we marked the particles with line - of - sight velocities @xmath48 km s@xmath6 ( with respect to the mean velocity of the main halo ) with black dots and those with larger velocities with green ones .",
    "left panel shows all particles in this region of the simulation box , while the right one about 200 chosen randomly to create the mock data ( not all 200 particles are shown because the region in the direction of negative @xmath46 is not plotted ) .",
    "the figure demonstrates that in spite of their proximity in velocity space ( @xmath49 km s@xmath6 is of the order of @xmath50 of the big halo ) the two haloes are in fact very distant .",
    "the distance of the smaller halo , 45 mpc , corresponds to about 20 virial radii of the big halo therefore the haloes do not affect each other dynamically and are not bound to each other , but still their projected velocity distributions are entangled ( note that there are green particles in the centre of the bigger halo and black particles in the centre of the smaller halo ) .",
    "the reason for this is the rather low value of the hubble velocity in comparison with velocity dispersion of bound structures , e.g. velocity dispersions of massive haloes or galaxy clusters are comparable to the hubble flow at distances as large as 8 virial radii from their centres ( see fig . 3 of wojtak et al .",
    "the smaller halo in our example is receding from the bigger one with a velocity of about @xmath49 km s@xmath6 mainly due to the hubble flow which at distance of 45 mpc is of the order of @xmath51 km s@xmath6 .    to further illustrate the point",
    ", we provide an example of a well - behaved @xmath36 diagram .",
    "[ comparh6 ] shows again the @xmath36 diagram of our simulated halo from fig .",
    "[ halo6vp ] in the left panel , while in the right panel we present an analogous plot of line - of - sight velocities as a function of projected distance for 200 particles chosen from the same halo , but observed in a different direction . in this case",
    "the halo has no massive neighbours along the line of sight and the single particles with discrepant velocities can be easily dealt with using standard procedures for interloper removal .",
    "our purposely chosen example illustrates well the difficulties in interpreting the measured line - of - sight velocities of galaxy clusters in the case of presence of neighbouring structures .",
    "whereas velocity differences amounting up to @xmath52 km s@xmath6 , as in our simulated haloes , could easily be interpreted as orbital velocities of dynamically bound objects , they could also correspond to structures seen in projection but otherwise separated by distances much larger than their virial radii and , therefore , totally unrelated .    to make a connection with the studies based on lensing we note that the surface density distribution ( the main lensing observable ) measured along the line of sight in our simulations is increased by about 25 percent everywhere along the projected radius of the bigger halo due to the presence of the smaller halo .",
    "the significance of this effect will of course depend on the exact properties of the haloes and probability of their alignment , which will be studied elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that cosmological structures quite distant from each other , when aligned with the direction of observation , can produce projected velocity distributions which are quite difficult to interpret . in particular , such extended distributions can lead to very different velocity dispersion , and therefore mass , estimates . the complicated structure of the velocity distribution , with many peaks",
    ", suggests however that we indeed deal with multiple objects situated along the line of sight . on the other hand",
    "the simulations show that close neighbours , within one virial radius from each other ( like mergers or infalling subhalo ) , have similar velocities and would produce regular , one - peak velocity distributions .",
    "given the multi - peak velocity structure of a1689 we conclude that the groups of galaxies with @xmath53 km s@xmath6 ( and of course also the more discrepant group at @xmath54 km s@xmath6 ) with respect to the cluster mean velocity are probably separate structures not associated with the cluster , but aligned along the line of sight .",
    "if the velocities @xmath53 km s@xmath6 are due mainly to the hubble flow these structures are located at about 60 mpc from the cluster . for a cluster mass of @xmath4 the distance corresponds to about 17 virial radii .",
    "this would mean that the structures do not affect the cluster dynamically and can not be responsible for any departures from equilibrium .",
    "this rather complex structure in velocity does not necessarily translate itself into the x - ray gas distribution that can appear regular and smooth .",
    "this is indeed the case for a1689 , in which the morphology of the x - ray data is commonly interpreted as a clear indication of the relaxed state of the cluster .",
    "andersson & madejski ( 2004 ) demonstrate however that in the case of two similar clusters aligned along the line of sight x - ray data can easily underestimate the mass by a factor of 2 .",
    "the presence of foreground and background structures in the line of sight of a1689 may affect the path of light coming from the lensed galaxies",
    ". in their study of strong lensing in a1689 broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2005a ) managed to subtract the neighbouring structure from the main lensing signal .",
    "however , no such correction was made when the analysis was extended by broadhurst et al .",
    "( 2005b ) to weak lensing and larger distances from the cluster centre .",
    "hoekstra ( 2003 ) has shown that even the presence of distant large - scale structure in the universe can affect the weak lensing signal , significantly increasing the uncertainty in the estimated parameters for a given cluster . a similar increase in the estimated errors",
    "was shown to be the case if the cluster departs from spherical symmetry ( oguri et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it would be interesting to verify whether objects in the vicinity of the cluster could cause similar effect , thereby decreasing the claimed discrepancy with cdm structures , especially when the weak lensing signal is very low and the inferred surface mass distribution in the outer regions very uncertain , as in the case of a1689 ( broadhurst et al .",
