    "recent optical studies indicate that the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function may grow significantly steeper than the power - law slope seen at intermediate ranges ( marzke , huchra , & geller 1994a ; driver & phillipps 1996 ; loveday 1997 ) .",
    "the rise appears to be present in both cluster and field galaxies , and is particularly strong among magellanic spirals and irregulars ( marzke et al .",
    "this is intriguing because if the faint - end slope is steep enough , a significant fraction of baryonic matter may be bound to small galaxies .",
    "since optical counts of low - luminosity sources may have subtle selection effects , several groups have taken an independent approach , making `` blind '' searches for extragalactic 21 cm hi emission ( see spitzak & schneider 1998 , paper i , and references therein ) .",
    "hi observations are advantageous for detecting low - luminosity systems because starlight is not needed to power 21 cm line emission , and hi is generally abundant in field dwarfs .",
    "our hi survey in the `` arecibo slice '' ( paper i ) detected 75 hi sources and is the first blind hi survey to detect sources over a range of masses comparable to the range of optical luminosities in samples in which the faint - end steepening is seen .",
    "one other published survey , the arecibo hi strip survey or `` ahiss '' ( sorar 1994 ; zwaan et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter zbss ) , samples a comparable area of the sky , however it was carried out and analyzed in a different fashion . in our arecibo slice ,",
    "closely spaced , pointed observations were made so that all sources were detected in the telescope s main beam , and the effective sensitivity over the survey area was relatively uniform . in the ahiss , driftscans were used and sources were detected all over the main beam and sidelobes of the telescope .",
    "the most important information needed for converting survey detections into a mass function is a thorough understanding of the survey s completeness . both the arecibo slice and ahiss",
    "have now been followed up by confirmation observations that give accurate fluxes for the sources , but to determine the completeness we must understand the sensitivity to sources in their original detection scans .",
    "for this reason the sidelobe detections of the ahiss are problematic .",
    "the arecibo sidelobes had asymmetries and temperature dependencies that made their sensitivity uncertain",
    ". moreover , the original detection fluxes of ahiss sidelobe sources were not saved ( sorar 1998 , private communication ) , so we can not apply completeness tests after the fact . for these reasons , we will consider only the 45 main - beam ahiss sources in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the problem with sidelobe source sensitivity is also the main reason why an analysis of the original results from the ahiss by schneider ( 1997 ) gave different results from zbss , who attributed the difference to using the original arecibo detection fluxes versus their new vla measurements .",
    "this is unlikely to explain the difference since gain variations due to the uncertain positions should have introduced a shift and a scatter in the results that were smaller on average than the bin size used in the mass function .",
    "instead , we believe the difference arises from zbss s inclusion of low - sensitivity sidelobe detections17 of 18 of these had high hi masses @xmath1 .",
    "( note that we use galactocentric velocities and assume @xmath2 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 . )",
    "including these sources could easily bias the apparent slope of the hi mass function because of the uncertainties in sidelobe behavior .    rather than entering into further debate about details of observational technique , we propose to demonstrate and apply a technique for directly determining the completeness of hi surveys .",
    "we show how to use an estimate of the density variations due to large scale structure ( lss ) in the area of a survey to test and correct for survey sensitivity . based on the available data ,",
    "we show that the arecibo hi surveys are consistent with a steepening at the faint end of the hi mass function , which is quite similar to the results of loveday ( 1997 ) for optically - selected field galaxies .",
    "we first examine the lss in the regions of the two hi surveys in  2 . using the lss information , we determine the behavior of the sensitivity limits of the hi surveys in  3 . then in  4 , we derive the mass function for the arecibo surveys .",
    "we conclude with a summary and discussion of the results in  5 .",
    "using optical redshifts we can make lss density estimates as a function of redshift over the areas surveyed for hi .",
    "these density estimates should be appropriate for our purposes since hi sources qualitatively trace the same structure as optically identified galaxies ( paper i ) .",
    "we use galaxies from the `` rc3 '' ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) that are within @xmath4 of the narrow declination bands examined in each hi survey .",
    "the rc3 sources with redshifts in these regions appear to be complete to a limiting magnitude of @xmath5 based on their number counts increasing like @xmath6 .",
    "since the ahiss strips cross through the galactic plane the rc3 coverage of them is incomplete , but we shall show later that the results are consistent with the arecibo slice and the effect of lss is small in any case .    for a galaxy with apparent magnitude @xmath7 ,",
    "the maximum redshift at which it would remain brighter than @xmath8 is @xmath9 , where we assume the redshift @xmath10 is directly proportional to distance .",
    "the number of galaxies we expect to observe with @xmath11 but @xmath12 is : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mean relative density out to redshift @xmath10 .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 represents an integral of the luminosity function , but since it divides out in the end , its form need not be known",
    ".    we can write a recursive relation between the mean density for the galaxies out to @xmath10 and out to the galaxy with the next smaller redshift @xmath16 : @xmath17 we normalize @xmath18 averaged over the full redshift range of the survey .",
    "( this normalization may affect the overall scaling of the mass function , but not its shape . )",
    "this gives us the mean relative density for all smaller redshifts which we differentiate to find the local relative density @xmath19 shown in fig .",
    "[ lssdensity ] .",
    "( to produce this plot the data were binned and smoothed with a gaussian of 500 km s@xmath3 fwhm . )",
    "both surveys show an excess of galaxies around @xmath20 km s@xmath3 caused by the pisces - perseus supercluster .",
    "the density of galaxies also rises at small redshifts in the arecibo slice due to the local supercluster .",
    "this nearby rise might exaggerate the counts of low mass sources since they are detectable only out to small velocities .",
    "however , we shall show in  5 that the magnitude of the effect is small .",
    "a more useful aspect of our lss determination is that it permits us to test the surveys completeness .",
    "to determine the number density of sources of a given hi mass , we must accurately establish the volume within which a survey is sensitive to them .",
    "this is complicated by several factors : ( 1 ) the same galaxy observed at different inclinations will have different line widths ; ( 2 ) blind hi surveys detect objects with sensitivities that depend on distance from beam center and frequency ; and ( 3 ) efforts to reject man - made interference and to subtract instrumental `` baselines '' can artificially suppress real signals . since these hi surveys include only confirmed sources , we do not need to worry about the opposite problem of including unreliable sources , but we need some means of establishing the surveys completeness .    for a galaxy with a total signal @xmath21 ( integrating the hi flux density over the 21 cm line width @xmath22 ) the peak signal - to - noise ratio @xmath23 is achieved when the spectrum is smoothed to a velocity resolution equal to @xmath22 . in this ideal case ,",
    "@xmath24 ( see , for example , schneider 1997 ; zbss ) . in paper",
    "i we found our minimum detected fluxes were at a signal - to - noise @xmath25 based on this description .",
    "the noise level in the ahiss spectra varied substantially in different regions depending on the total number of drift - scan spectra , which were collected once per day and then averaged .",
    "when we use the noise value for each source ( based on the number of observations averaged in its vicinity according to sorar 1994 ) we find a lower limit of @xmath26 .",
    "this higher limit probably reflects the fact that sorar ( 1994 ) confirmed whether sources were detected `` by inspecting the data for each day separately . ''",
    "sources close to his quoted 5@xmath27 search limit would be only 12@xmath27 in a single day s data and very difficult to confirm .",
    "a direct test of whether a survey is complete to its quoted sensitivity limit is to compute @xmath28 .",
    "this should average to @xmath29 if @xmath30 is correctly determined ( schmidt 1968 ) . in this test we set @xmath30 to the smaller of the bandpass limit and the highest detectable redshift based on the claimed detection limit .",
    "we find @xmath0 averages to 0.39 for the arecibo slice using our quoted 5@xmath27 limit .",
    "we find an even lower average , 0.34 , for the ahiss sources using their quoted 5@xmath27 limit , or 0.41 using our estimated 7@xmath27 limit .    to determine whether lss could affect @xmath0 , we examine its dependence on redshift . the heavy line in fig .",
    "[ vvmax ] shows the expected behavior as a function of redshift for the density distribution derived in  2 .",
    "( at each @xmath30 we consider all sources @xmath31 with @xmath32 . )",
    "the dotted lines show the observed behavior of @xmath0 based on the suggested detection limits of the two hi surveys .",
    "the values are systematically below @xmath29 even at redshifts where lss should make them high .",
    "this should not be surprising , since a _ detection _ limit is normally lower than a _ completeness _ limit .",
    "we can force the average value of @xmath0 to be @xmath33 by assuming the @xmath23 must be 40% higher for the completeness limit ( dashed lines ) , but the result is systematically too high at low redshifts .",
    "a better explanation is that the completeness limit does not actually depend on a source s line width like @xmath34 as assumed above .",
    "we noted indications of this in paper i  narrow - line sources were detected to lower @xmath23 . we have experimented with sensitivities that depend on @xmath35 , defining a new `` signal - to - noise '' ratio : @xmath36 where rms is the noise measured at the spectral resolution @xmath37 , @xmath38 is the integrated flux in the line , and the result is normalized to match @xmath23 at @xmath39 km s@xmath3 .",
    "a good empirical fit for the completeness limit is found with @xmath40 , which suggests that a minimum flux density also plays a role in detection . for @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 for ahiss detections )",
    ", we get the thin solid - line curves in fig .",
    "[ vvmax ] , which match the expected @xmath0 behavior quite well . by inverting eqn .",
    "[ sneqn ] , these values also define the `` completeness flux '' for a source , @xmath43 , for which the survey is on average complete .",
    "equipped with knowledge of lss and survey completeness , we can derive the hi mass function .",
    "we do this by means of the @xmath44 method .",
    "zbss refer to this as the @xmath45 method , but we want to avoid confusion with @xmath46 as defined in  3 .",
    "@xmath44 describes the total `` completeness volume '' in which a source should on average have been detected over the entire survey area , taking into account offsets from beam center , etc . ; @xmath46 describes the maximum distance a source should have been detected in its actual detection spectrum .",
    "the completeness volume of each source implies an overall density of sources : @xmath47 for sources in the mass range @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "this method depends critically on an accurate determination of the completeness volume , which we discuss first , and is also influenced by lss , which we address subsequently .",
    "we empirically determined the decline in sensitivity to sources offset from the beam center by using the ratio of detection fluxes to true fluxes ( found from follow - up observations ) . because of the hexagonal sampling pattern in the arecibo slice , sources were never farther than about 2.3@xmath50 from beam center .",
    "we limit our analysis of ahiss sources to those within 3@xmath50 of beam center .    the frequency dependence of arecibo s line feeds changes the gain by up to a factor of @xmath51 over the observed redshift ranges .",
    "the ahiss @xmath52 strip presents a problem here .",
    "the data were collected with the feed tuned to different frequencies on different days , making the sensitivity up to @xmath53 larger or smaller at different points in the bandpass , and the detections were carried out on subsets of the data with different frequency dependences .",
    "too few details of this were recorded to allow us to reconstruct the exact detection characteristics , so we treat the @xmath52 strip like the @xmath54 strip , for which the frequency dependence remained fixed .",
    "we determine @xmath44 for each source in the arecibo slice and ahiss by numerically integrating the search volume over all possible positions within the survey boundaries .",
    "we include the frequency dependence across the bandpass to determine at which redshifts a source s observed flux should be detectable .",
    "finally , the differing ahiss @xmath55 noise levels were also included in the calculation of the total completeness volume .",
    "some of the lowest flux ( not necessarily low mass ) sources are fainter than the completeness flux , @xmath43 , estimated above",
    ". however , this does not affect the shape of the mass function at the faint end since @xmath44 changes by the same factor for all but the highest mass sources ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we checked this conclusion by using monte carlo simulations of sources following a schechter function ( @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) , selecting sources statistically to imitate the declining completeness seen in the hi surveys .",
    "we found that application of the @xmath0 test and @xmath44 method recovered the input density and slope .",
    "another concern in determining the mass function is the effect of large scale structure .",
    "zbss have shown that the @xmath44 method is fairly insensitive to sinusoidal variations in lss , but it is important to determine whether a local overdensity could have a significant effect on the source counts at the low - mass end .    our test of the possible significance of lss is to use the optically - based density structure determined in  2 .",
    "each source s value of @xmath44 is corrected to account for the probability of finding a source within its completeness volume .",
    "this is done by dividing @xmath44 by the mean density out to the source s maximum detectable redshift : @xmath59 .",
    "since this depends on beam offset and the other sensitivity factors , we calculate the corrected volume in our numerical integrations of the completeness volume described above .",
    "the joint mass function for the arecibo slice and ahiss is shown by solid circles with poisson 95% confidence limits ( gehrels 1986 ) in fig .",
    "[ himassfunc ] . to calculate the joint mass function",
    "requires that we determine each source s completeness volume in the other survey .",
    "this is straightforward since line widths and source fluxes were measured similarly in the two surveys , giving us a sample of 120 hi sources .",
    "the lss turns out to have only a minor effect on the resulting mass function .",
    "solid squares show the mass function we would have determined directly from the @xmath44 method with no lss corrections .",
    "( note that the points are offset to the left for clarity . )",
    "there is a small adjustment at low - masses , but the local overdensity would have to be many times larger for this to have generated the higher value we see .",
    "the results from the arecibo slice alone are shown by open circles in the figure ; from ahiss , by open squares .",
    "we also show results for the @xmath54 strip of ahiss ( open triangles ) alone , which did not suffer from the problems with the @xmath52 strip described earlier .",
    "the @xmath54 results generally agree better with the arecibo slice results .",
    "the present combination of the arecibo slice and arecibo hi strip survey yields the largest and deepest sample of hi - selected sources studied to date .",
    "the hi mass function derived from these surveys is suggestive of a turn - up at the low - mass end of the hi mass function similar to that seen at the faint end of the optical luminosity function . in fig .",
    "[ himassfunc ] we show the empirical luminosity function found by loveday ( 1997 ) scaled to match the turnover at high hi masses .",
    "the turn - up we see at low hi masses is at about the same relative location loveday found optically .",
    "the rise at the faint end of the hi mass function appears to be in good agreement with the optical results of marzke et al .",
    "( 1994b ) , who found that the rise results primarily from late - type galaxies .",
    "zbss have argued that the hi mass function is consistent with a relatively shallow - sloped rise like the @xmath60 schechter function shown by a dotted curve in fig .",
    "[ himassfunc ] .",
    "we find an apparent rise in the lowest @xmath61 bin , in which two hi sources were detected in the arecibo slice .",
    "the ahiss detected no sources with such low masses , but we would have expected only 12 sources ( @xmath62 source in the @xmath54 strip ) , based on the relative volume sensitivities . obviously these are small number statistics , but the 95% poisson confidence limit excludes the schechter fit proposed by zbss .",
    "the differences we find in this paper result from the greater success of the arecibo slice project in detecting low - mass hi sources , the rejection of sidelobe sources from the ahiss , and the completeness tests we have applied .",
    "we believe that many previous surveys have overestimated their sensitivity and hence their completeness volumes ( @xmath44 ) , and therefore underestimated the counts of low mass sources .",
    "the rise at the low - mass end of the hi mass function is still a relatively weak statistical result , but we have shown that it can not be attributed to two potential observational issues .",
    "( 1 ) narrow - line sources are easier to detect than wide - line sources at the same statistical @xmath23 .",
    "we have determined that this is described by an effective `` @xmath23''@xmath63 and adjust our results accordingly .",
    "( 2 ) the overdensity of sources in the local supercluster can also exaggerate low - mass counts , but we show this effect to be minimal , at least if hi sources are no more clustered than optically - selected sources .",
    "the volume of space so - far surveyed at high enough sensitivity to detect low hi - mass sources is still small , so large new surveys currently planned or ongoing should definitively establish the shape of hi mass function .",
    "however , the results will remain only as accurate as the determination of the surveys actual completeness limits .",
    "we have demonstrated in this paper how to use information about the lss and a @xmath0 test to directly determine an appropriate sensitivity limit , and we recommend that other hi surveys test their completeness similarly ."
