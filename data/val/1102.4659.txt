    "a quantum process is said to be markovian if the future states of the process depends only on the state of present time . in contrast ,",
    "dependence on past states should then be a characteristic feature of non - markovian processes . with the development of technology to manipulate quantum system ,",
    "the quantum non - markovian process has attracted increasing attention in recent years @xcite . on one hand",
    "the inevitable interaction of a quantum system with its environment leads to dissipation of energy and loss of quantum coherence , on the other hand the quantum system may temporarily regain some of the previously lost energy and/or information due to non - markovian effects in the dynamics .",
    "this motivates the study on the non - markovianity and a measure for the degree of non - markovianity is indeed needed .",
    "several approaches are proposed to quantify non - markovianity , including the measure based on the increase of trace distance @xcite , the measure by quantifying the increase of entanglement shared between the system and an isolated ancilla and the divisibility of the dynamical map@xcite , the measure based on the decay rate of master equation itself @xcite , and the measure through the fisher information flow@xcite .",
    "although several approaches to quantifying the non - markovianity are proposed , the definition of non - markovianity still remains elusive and , in some sense , controversial @xcite .",
    "it has been proven that all divisible dynamical maps are markovian , this divisibility property holds for a larger class of quantum processes than those described by the lindblad master equation , for example , the time - local master equation with positive decay rates .",
    "this indicates that the divisibility may be a good starting point to quantify non - markovianity . in this paper",
    ", we will propose a measure for non - markovianity based on the divisibility of dynamical maps , three dynamical maps are presented and the corresponding non - markovian measures are calculated .",
    "these results suggest that the measure can capture the feature of non - markovian dynamics , and provide an easy way to calculate the non - markovianity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we discuss the non - divisibility of dynamical map and the non - markovianity of this map . in sec.iii , we introduce a measure for non - markovianity .",
    "three examples are presented and discussed in sec.iv .",
    "sec.v summarizes our results .",
    "in quantum markovian process , the future state of the quantum system depends only on the state of present time . however , writing this statement in a precise mathematical representation is not an easy task .",
    "instead , we use the following description for quantum markovian process",
    ". a quantum evolution is markovian if it is an element of any one - parameter continuous completely positive semigroup @xcite .",
    "the quantum evolution governed by the master equation @xmath0 is an example , where @xmath1 is a time - independent generator of the well - known lindblad form , @xmath2\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum_\\alpha\\gamma_a(v_\\alpha\\rho { v_\\alpha}^\\dag-\\frac{1}{2}{v_\\alpha}^\\dag v_\\alpha \\rho- \\frac{1}{2}\\rho{v_\\alpha}^\\dag v_\\alpha ) \\label{eqn : mgen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath3 .",
    "this generator leads to completely positive trace - preserving maps @xmath4 and it satisfies the composition law , @xmath5 if a dynamical map can be written in this decomposition with both @xmath6 and @xmath7 being completely positive , the dynamical map is called divisible .",
    "this composition law can be extended to a general case , where the generator in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : mgen ] ) is time - dependent , namely , @xmath8 with @xmath9+\\sum_\\alpha\\gamma_{\\alpha}(t ) ( v_\\alpha(t)\\rho { v_\\alpha}^\\dag(t)-\\\\\\frac{1}{2}{v_\\alpha}^\\dag(t ) v_\\alpha(t ) \\rho-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho{v_\\alpha}^\\dag(t ) v_\\alpha(t ) ) , \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\label{eqn : tdmargen } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "this is known as time - dependent markovian @xcite .",
    "the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tdmarme ] ) can be written in terms of the two - parameter family of dynamical maps @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the composition law corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tidcomplaw ] ) becomes @xmath13 and the map @xmath11 can be written as @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the chronological operator .",
    "the composition law ( divisibility of the map ) implies that the dynamical map @xmath11 @xmath16 transforming a state at @xmath17 into a state at @xmath18 ( for systems governed by time independent master equation ( [ eqn : me ] ) , @xmath19 ) must be trace - preserving and completely positive , regardless of which dynamics it describes , e.g. , it is from the time - dependent master equation or the time - independent master equation .",
    "note that the starting time @xmath17 is not zero .    a measure for non",
    "- markovianity should quantify the deviation of a dynamical map from markovian evolution .",
    "noticing that when a dynamics is non - markovian , the dynamical map @xmath11 may not be completely positive , we may use the non - divisibility to quantify the non - markovianity .",
    "in fact , this is the underlying reason that the trace distance can increase @xcite , and the system gains entanglement with an isolated ancilla @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that there is no contradiction between the requirement on non - completely positivity and that on physics . consider a quantum evolution in a time interval @xmath20 , we always have @xmath21 due to the time continuity .",
    "for @xmath22 to be a dynamical map , it is required that @xmath22 must be completely positive , however , @xmath11 may not be completely positive .",
    "therefore these two - parameter maps in non - markovian dynamics do not generate a quantum dynamical semigroup .",
    "then one may wonder : does there exist a @xmath11 that it is not completely positive but @xmath22 does ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "first , a wide range of non - markovian process can be described by time - local master equations via time - convolutionless projection operator @xcite .",
    "second , it has been shown that any quantum dynamics described by memory kernel master equation may be written in a time - local form @xcite .",
    "note that the decay rates in these time - local master equation are different from that in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tdmargen ] ) , they can be negative . with this time - local master equation ,",
    "the dynamical map with non - zero starting time in eq.([eqn : marmap ] ) may violate the complete positivity due to the negative decay rates .",
    "this implies that the non - complete positivity of the map @xmath11 is an essential feature of non - markovian process",
    ". the time - dependent decay rate may be negatively infinite at some points of time , where the reviving of population or regaining of quantum coherence happen @xcite .",
    "we call these points of time singular points @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath24 or @xmath25 , @xmath11 may not exist .",
    "however , we can use @xmath11 in the limit that @xmath26 instead of @xmath27 .",
    "it is convenient to discuss @xmath11 with a specific time - local master equation , but this is not necessary .",
    "to construct a measure for non - markovianity , we resort to the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite , it asserts that a linear map @xmath28 : @xmath29 is isomorphic to the choi matrix , @xmath30 where @xmath31 are orthogonal bases .",
    "an familiar form of the choi matrix is @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the maximally entangled state @xmath34 , @xmath35 is an identity map acting on the ancilla , and @xmath36 is the normalized @xmath37 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath28 is completely positive if and only if @xmath36 is positive semidefinite . in other words ,",
    "the sufficient and necessary condition of non - complete positivity is the negativity of @xmath36 .",
    "hence , the sum of negative eigenvalues of @xmath36 can be taken as a measure for the non - complete positivity of the dynamical map .",
    "however , the summation may sometimes be an infinite value in some models due to singular decay rates , this suggests to use a normalized quantity @xmath38 as a measure for non - complete positivity of the map @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the @xmath41 negative eigenvalue of @xmath36 . clearly if @xmath42 , @xmath43 @xmath44 .",
    "then we have @xmath45 .",
    "based on the complete positivity property of the map @xmath46 , a measure of non - markovianity has been proposed @xcite .",
    "this measure is different from ours in that we use the an averaged negativity of the map @xmath46 to quantify the non - markovianity .",
    "moreover , insightful examples are presented to shed light on the non - markovianity measure .    to calculate eq .",
    "( [ ncp ] ) with a given time - local master equation , the exact form of @xmath46 is not necessary .",
    "what we need is to extend the time - local master equation from one system to two systems , taking an isolated ancilla attached to the system .",
    "the hilbert space is extended from @xmath47 to @xmath48 accordingly .",
    "all operators , say @xmath49 , are replaced by @xmath50 by this extension , we get a new master equation , which describes the system and the ancilla .",
    "the system evolves in the same manner as before , while the anciila is isolated from both the system and environment .",
    "the master equation can be solved starting from @xmath33 at time @xmath17 and the state at time @xmath18 ( @xmath51 ) can be obtained .",
    "we aim at finding a measure @xmath52 for non - markovianity which captures the feature of non - complete positivity of all possible @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath43 is a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath53 count the number of @xmath43 in all time interval with @xmath43 @xmath54 , i.e. @xmath55 if @xmath56 , i.e. , all @xmath11 ( for any @xmath17 and @xmath18 , as long as @xmath51 ) are completely positive , the non - markovinity @xmath52 should be defined to be zero . if @xmath57 , we define @xmath58 as a measure of non - markovianity .",
    "this can be understood as an averaged non - complete positivity of all the non - completely positive maps in interval @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , from @xmath60 , we have @xmath61 .    the upper limit of the integral @xmath15 in the definition eq .",
    "( [ eqn : define ] ) is taken to be infinite . however , the distribution of @xmath43 on @xmath62 plan is often periodic or is limited in a small area , this suggests that the integration can be taken merely in one period of time or taken in a finite area .",
    "when @xmath43 is neither periodic nor limited in a small region , the upper limit @xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : define ] ) should be large enough to get a convergent @xmath52",
    ". the definition can be written into a simple form , @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents all the non - completely positive maps and @xmath65 means expectation value .",
    "therefore , @xmath52 can be numerically calculated by averaging a large number of non - completely positive maps with equal weight ( or randomly ) in a _ representative area _ as discussed above .",
    "the representative area means one period in time or a limited region where @xmath66    to illustrate the measure of non - markovianity , we present three examples in the next section .",
    "we work in the interaction picture for simplicity to calculate the measure , since unitary transformation does not change the eigenvalues of @xmath36 as well as @xmath43 of @xmath11 , hence the non - markovianity measure under unitary transformation remains unchanged .",
    "the first example is a two - level system coupling to a reservoir at zero temperature .",
    "the reservoir consists of infinite number of harmonic oscillators that is also referred in the literature as the spin - boson model .",
    "this model is exactly solvable @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for such a system reads , @xmath67 @xmath68 where @xmath69 . the rabi frequency of the two - level system and the frequency for the @xmath70 harmonic oscillator are denoted by @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively . @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the creation and annihilation operators of @xmath70 oscillator , which couples to the system with coupling constant @xmath75 .    assuming the system and the reservoir are initially uncorrelated , we can obtain a time - dependent master equation in the interaction picture , @xmath76\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\gamma(t)(\\sigma^-\\rho\\sigma^+-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^+ \\sigma^-\\rho-\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\sigma^+\\sigma^- ) , \\label{eqn : exactnm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "@xmath79 plays the role of lamb shift and @xmath80 is the decay rate .",
    "both @xmath79 and @xmath80 are time - dependent .",
    "@xmath81 is determined by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the environmental correlation function . in the derivation of the master equation",
    ", the reservoir is assumed in its vacuum at @xmath84 .",
    "consider the following spectral density , @xmath85 where @xmath86 represents the coupling constant between the system and reservoir , @xmath87 defines the spectral width of the coupling at the resonance point @xmath71 . for the spectral density ( [ sd ] ) , we have @xmath88 , @xmath89 $ ] , and @xmath90 with @xmath91 .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ eqn : exactnm ] ) is derived without any approximations , hence it is non - markovian and it exactly describes the dynamics of the open system .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath87 characterizes the correlation time @xmath92 of the reservoir through @xmath93 .",
    "the time scale @xmath94 on which the state of the system changes is given by @xmath95 .",
    "so the degree of non - markovianity should be relevant to the rate @xmath96 .",
    "namely , when @xmath97 is very small , the evolution is markovian , when @xmath92 is comparable with @xmath94 , the memory effect of reservoir should be taken into account , the dynamics of the open system is then non - markovian .",
    "let us first analyze the non - markovianity of the dynamics by examining @xmath80 . for @xmath98 , @xmath80 is always positive and it is a monotonically increasing function of time , all @xmath11 are completely positive , hence the dynamics is markovian .",
    "when @xmath99 , @xmath80 is a periodic function of time , it takes negative values sometimes .",
    "in particular , @xmath80 has discrete singular points where the upper level gains population , this is a typical feature of non - markovianity .",
    "now we see if our measure can capture all these features of non - markonianity . in order to apply our measure",
