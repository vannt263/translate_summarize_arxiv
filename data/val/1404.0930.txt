    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides a lot of new insight into wide regions of physics , and it is significant to reveal even more properties of this duality for understanding string theories and gauge theories . while many attempts succeed in confirming it in lower dimensions , the higher - dimensional versions of the correspondence are still mysterious .",
    "the main reason is that there are few known facts about conformal field theories in higher dimensions .",
    "however , recently it was found that the supersymmetric localization can be applied to 5d super yang - mills theories on curved geometries and their partition functions can be derived exactly as mentioned below .",
    "we can utilize them to verify the @xmath6/cft@xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "for example , there are a few pieces of evidence of the @xmath9/cft@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the 5d @xmath11 super yang - mills theories are constructed on several curved backgrounds .",
    "their partition functions and expectation values of wilson loops have been calculated by the localization technique @xcite .",
    "the 5d @xmath12 theory on the round five - sphere with a radius @xmath13 , which contains a vector multiplet and an adjoint hypermultiplet , has @xmath14 supersymmetry if the mass for the hypermultiplet takes a specific value .",
    "then the partition functions and wilson loops reduce to the chern - simons matrix model @xcite first considered in @xcite .",
    "also , we can produce the 5d maximal super yang - mills ( msym ) on @xmath15 from the ( 2,0 ) theory by the dimensional reduction with the appropriate twist to keep the supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "it is argued in @xcite that kaluza - klein modes in 6d can be identified with instanton particles in 5d under @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radius of the compactified @xmath4 , and @xmath18 is the five - dimensional gauge coupling constant .",
    "following their discussion , the 5d msym seems to contain all degrees of freedom of the ( 2,0 ) theory .",
    "an observation supporting this claim is that the free energy obtained by the chern - simons matrix model reproduces @xmath19 behavior of the supergravity analysis on @xmath2 @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the expectation values of wilson surfaces for the @xmath0/cft@xmath1 correspondence . the wilson surfaces in the ( 2,0 ) theory are a class of nonlocal operators localized on surfaces in 6d @xcite . through the above argument , wilson surfaces extending to the compatified direction are wilson loops in the 5d theory . therefore , we compute the expectation values of them by using the chern - simons matrix model . in particular we evaluate the expectation values of wilson loops in large - rank anti - symmetric representations and symmetric representations in the large @xmath20 limit .    on the other hand , naively a probe m2-brane ending on multiple m5-branes is the m - theory description of the wilson surface @xcite . the holographical description of a spherical wilson surface has been studied in @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been clarified in @xcite that the expectation value of the wilson surface wrapping on @xmath21 in the fundamental representation matches that of the m2-brane wrapping @xmath22 .    in this paper , we consider a probe m5-brane description of the wilson surface @xcite instead of the m2-brane .",
    "when the number of the overlapping and winding m2-branes becomes large , they blow up and make an m5-brane with worldvolume flux wrapping two types of submanifolds of @xmath2 due to the representation : one is @xmath23 totally in @xmath0 , and the other is @xmath24 belonging to @xmath25 .",
    "this is the analogue of the d3-brane and d5-brane description of the symmetric and anti - symmetric wilson loops in @xmath26/cft@xmath27 correspondence@xcite . according to this analogy",
    ", we expect that an m5-brane wrapping on @xmath23 corresponds to the symmetric representation and one wrapping on @xmath24 corresponds to the anti - symmetric representation .",
    "we calculate the expectation values of the wilson surfaces by evaluating the on - shell action of these m5-branes . in the calculation for the m5-branes , we use the so - called pasti - sorokin - tonin ( pst )",
    "action @xcite .",
    "we compare the results on the cft side and the gravity side , and we find new evidence supporting the @xmath0/cft@xmath1 correspondence ; the m5-brane wrapping @xmath23 and wrapping @xmath28 perfectly agree with the wilson surface in symmetric representation and in anti - symmetric representation respectively .",
    "we note that the authors of @xcite have suggested that the relation be modified at strong coupling such that the constant coefficient becomes dependent on the square of the mass for the adjoint hypermultiplet .",
    "one can find that our results are truly consistent with their argument .",
    "one of the interesting future directions is to study the relation between the bubbling geometry and wilson surfaces in larger representations .",
    "a class of bubbling solutions in the 11-dimensional supergravity as the gravity dual of the wilson surfaces is obtained in @xcite along the line of the bubbling geometry for local operators @xcite and wilson loops @xcite . in these solutions ,",
    "the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix model is suggested as the following form : the real line of the eigenvalue space is divided into black and white segments , and the density is a positive constant on the black segments and zero on the white segments .",
    "the unit length of a black segment is twice that of a white segment .",
    "actually , the eigenvalue distribution of the chern - simons matrix model obtained in @xcite is consistent with the bubbling solutions .",
    "this observation is other evidence of the correspondence .",
    "it will be an interesting future work to calculate the expectation values of wilson surfaces by using the bubbling solutions and compare them to the calculation in the chern - simons matrix model .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ csmm ] we use the chern - simons matrix model and evaluate the expectation values of wilson surfaces in anti - symmetric representation and symmetric representation . in section [ m5 ] , we use probe m5-branes on the gravity side and calculate the expectation values of the wilson surfaces .",
    "we consider 6d a@xmath29 type ( 2,0 ) theory on @xmath30 and a wilson surface in this theory .",
    "this wilson surface is wrapping on @xmath21 where the first @xmath5 is orthogonal to @xmath31 and the second @xmath5 is a great circle of @xmath31 .",
    "this wilson surface can be treated as a wilson loop wrapping a great circle in 5d su@xmath32 msym on @xmath31 if the boundary condition in the @xmath5 direction is twisted appropriately @xcite .",
    "the expectation values of wilson loops wrapping on the great circle on @xmath31 with a radius @xmath13 are calculated by using the localization technique @xcite .",
    "in particular , the expectation value of the wilson loop in the representation @xmath33 in msym with a coupling constant @xmath18 reduces to the chern - simons matrix model @xmath34}{\\text{tr}}_{r } e^{n \\nu } , \\label{wlr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 .",
