    "the seyfert 1 galaxy  has played an important role in studies of accretion onto black holes due to the presence of a broad , skewed iron line in its x - ray spectrum ( tanaka 1995 ) .",
    "the shape of the line seen with  is consistent with emission from the surface of an accretion disc extending from about 6 to more than 40 gravitational radii ( @xmath3 ) inclined at about 30 deg to the line of sight ( fabian 1995 ) .",
    "occasionally the red ( i.e. lower energy ) wing of the line is seen to extend below 4  kev ( iwasawa 1996 ; 1999 ) .",
    "this can be explained by the disc extending within @xmath0 which may imply the black hole must be rapidly spinning .",
    "the presence of the broad iron line in  has been confirmed by  ( guainazzi 1999 ) ,  ( wilms 2001 ) and  ( lee 2002 ) .",
    "here we present preliminary results from a long 325  ks observation of  made with .",
    "the source was at a similar flux level to the previous  observations , and about 70 per cent brighter than during the earlier 100  ks  observation reported by branduardi - raymont ( 2001 ) and wilms ( 2001 ) .",
    "simultaneous observations were made with , providing coverage from @xmath40.2100  kev .",
    "the present work focuses on the spectrum above 2.5  kev and the iron - k line features ; absorption and emission features below 2  kev due to oxygen and other elements will be discussed more fully in later work .",

    "301 , 302 and 303 ) , during which all instruments were operating nominally .",
    "the present analysis is restricted to the data from the european photon imaging cameras ( epic ) . both the epic mos cameras ( turner 2001 ) and the epic pn camera ( strder 2001 ) were operated in small window mode and used the medium filter .",
    "extraction of science products from the observation data files ( odfs ) followed standard procedures using the  science analysis system v5.2 ( sas ) .",
    "the epic data were processed using the standard sas processing chains .",
    "source data were extracted from circular regions of radius 30 arcsec from the processed mos and pn images and background events were extracted from regions in the small window least effected by source photons .",
    "these showed the background to be relatively low and stable throughout the observation , with the exception of the final few ks of each revolution where the background rate increased .",
    "data from these periods were ignored .",
    "the total amount of `` good '' exposure time selected was 315  ks and 227  ks for mos and pn , respectively .",
    "( the lower pn exposure is due to the lower `` live time '' of the pn camera in small - window mode , @xmath471 per cent )",
    ".    the ratios of event patterns as a function of energy showed there is negligible pile - up in the pn data but the mos data suffer slightly from pile - up . a comparison of the data extracted including and excluding events from the central 10 arcsec of the source region showed only a slight flattening ( @xmath5 ) in the piled - up spectrum .",
    "this small effect was ignored in order to increase the number of source counts .",
    "events corresponding to patterns 012 ( single  quadruple pixel ) were extracted from the mos cameras and patterns 04 ( single+double ) were used for the pn spectral analysis , after checking for consistency with the pattern 0 ( single pixel event ) data .",
    "the total number of photons extracted from the source region was @xmath6 for the pn and @xmath7 for each mos camera .",
    "the  data were processed in the standard manner ( fiore 1999 ) .",
    "the spectral calibration of the epic cameras is still evolving . using the publicly available software and response matrices ,",
    "the remaining calibration - dependent residuals over the 2.510  kev range considered here should be at the @xmath8 per cent level ( see ferrando 2002 ) .",
    "however , there remain problems with the model for charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) for pn small - window mode data . in order to mitigate the effects of this ,",
    "a conservative approach was used for the present analysis , with detailed spectral fitting results based on only the mos data .",
    "the source spectra were grouped such that each bin contains at least 20 counts and were fitted using xspec v11.1 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the spectral responses used were m1_medv9q19t5r5_all_15.rsp for mos1 ( and similarly for mos2 ) and epn_sw20_sdy9_medium.rmf for the pn .",
    "the quoted errors on the derived model parameters correspond to a 90 per cent confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. a @xmath9 criterion ) , unless otherwise stated , and fit parameters ( specifically line and edge energies ) are quoted for the rest frame of the source .",
    "the epic mos data show a spectral form remarkably similar to those seen in earlier  observations , as illustrated in fig  [ fig : mos_spectrum ] ( cf .",
    "fig .  1 of iwasawa 1996 ) .",
    "the residuals around 6  kev have been interpreted as a broadened and redshifted iron k@xmath10 emission from a relativistic accretion disc ( tanaka 1995 ) .",
    "only the  epic spectrum above 2.5  kev is examined here , to limit the effects of the complex soft x - ray absorption ( see also lee 2001 ) , a detailed treatment of which is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "this energy range also excluded the region around the detector si k - edge ( 1.84  kev ) and the mirror au m - edge ( 2.3  kev ) .",
    "to better constrain the continuum , and in particular the compton reflection component ( e.g. george & fabian 1991 ; nandra & pounds 1994 ) , the mecs and pds data were also fitted simultaneously .",
    "the normalisations of the mos and mecs data were allowed to vary independently , to account for differences in the absolute calibration , with the pds normalisation tied to 0.86 times the mecs value ( fiore 1999 ) . galactic absorption ( @xmath11  @xmath12 ;",
    "dickey & lockman 1990 ) was included in all the models discussed below .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath13 this model includes @xmath14 and @xmath15 as free parameters , @xmath16 and emission from fe k@xmath17 ( see section  [ sect : complex ] ) .",
    "the iron line residuals were initially parameterised using a simple model comprising a power law plus compton reflection , narrow ( @xmath18  ev ) gaussian at 6.4  kev and a broad gaussian whose energy and width were free parameters .",
    "the compton reflector was assumed to be a neutral , static slab subtending a solid angle of @xmath19  sr at the x - ray source , inclined at @xmath20  deg , and having solar elemental abundances ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "the primary continuum was a power law with an exponential cutoff at a fixed energy of 400  kev ( constraints on the reflection and continuum parameters are discussed later ) .",
    "this model gave a good overall fit with @xmath21 for 1034 degrees of freedom ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the broad line component had an energy @xmath23  kev , a width of @xmath24  kev and equivalent width @xmath25  ev . the narrow , 6.4  kev `` core '' had @xmath26  ev and peaked very close to 6.4  kev , with @xmath27  kev if allowed to be free .",
    "very narrow components to the iron line , unresolvable by epic , have been observed in the  hetgs spectra of several seyferts ( yaqoob 2002 ) .",
    "they may be identified with emission from , e.g. the blr or molecular torus .",
    "such narrow lines are not ubiquitous , however , and allowing the 6.4  kev component to have a finite width is resolved with a width corresponding to @xmath28  km s@xmath29 and @xmath30  ev .",
    "the fit is excellent , the parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits ] ( model 1 ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the pn data gave generally consistent results and in particular the core of the line was again resolved .",
    "see also lee ( 2002 ) .",
    "the large width of the line core suggests that this also arises in the disc , rather than at a greater distance ( cf .",
    "ngc 5548 ; yaqoob 2001 ) .      to provide a more physically realistic description of the data the line profile of laor ( 1991 )",
    "was used to describe a broad line from an accretion disc surrounding a rotating black hole .",
    "the disc was assumed to be in a low state of ionisation , with the rest energy of the line fixed at 6.4  kev .",
    "the fits were relatively insensitive to the outer radius of the disc , which was therefore fixed at @xmath31 .",
    "the free parameters in the model were : the inner radius of the disc , @xmath32 , the inclination , @xmath33 , and the emissivity as a function of radius , which was parameterised as a power law of index @xmath34 ( i.e. @xmath35 ) . both the line and the reflection spectrum were blurred using the kernel from the laor model .",
    "the fit parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits ] ( model 2 ) , the @xmath36 is comparable to the broad plus narrow gaussian model , but falls short of the best fitting @xmath36 with two broad gaussians ( model 1 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that , with a simple power law emissivity function , the kerr line profile can not simultaneously model the broad , red wing of the line and the narrower core around 6.4  kev .",
    "the preliminary pn analysis gave comparable results but suggested an even stronger red wing to the line .      before exploring the red wing further",
    "it should be noted that there is some additional complexity in the line region at @xmath37  kev ( see inset of fig  [ fig : mos_spectrum ] ) . including an iron k - edge in model 2 provided a significant improvement in the fit ( @xmath38 ) , with an edge energy of @xmath39  kev and a depth of @xmath40 , similar to that discussed by pounds & reeves ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , such an edge must have a physical origin ; if it is due to neutral or near - neutral iron along the line of sight , then strong iron - l absorption is expected which is inconsistent with the soft x - ray spectrum ( lee 2001 ) . if the material is out of the line of sight and the edge is due to reflection off distant material , the reflection component must be very strong ( @xmath41 ) , which is then inconsistent with the relatively weak , narrow 6.4  kev iron line observed in the spectrum .",
    "another possibility is that the edge arises from thick material partially covering the line of sight .",
    "this gives a comparable fit ( @xmath42 ) to the edge , with a covering fraction of @xmath43 .",
    "using this model the broad line parameters differed only slightly from those of model  2 , and the broad , red wing of the line , extending within @xmath0 , was still required in the fit .",
    "sako ( 2002 ) suggested there may be significant absorption in the 6.46.7  kev range due to inner - shell transitions of ionised iron .",
    "this possibility was explored by including an absorption line in model 2 .",
    "this gave a good fit ( @xmath44 ) with absorption line parameters @xmath45  kev and @xmath46  ev . the relativistic line parameters differ only slightly , with the emissivity index changing to @xmath47 .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the complexity around 7.0  kev is in an emission component , identified with recombination emission by h - like iron .",
    "adding a gaussian to model 2 at @xmath48  kev again improved the fit ( @xmath49 ) and gives best fitting parameters of @xmath50  kev and @xmath51  ev .",
    "if a line of this strength is due to gas photoionised by the observed continuum then it must lie within a radius of @xmath52 . since it is not possible to unambiguously determine between absorption and emission as the source of complexity above 6.5  kev ,",
    "both are considered in the following subsections .",
    "a steep emissivity function was required to model the red wing of the line ( see also wilms 2001 ) , but this gave too little flux from the outer parts of the disc to model the core of the line .",
    "this raises the possibility that the emissivity function is not a simple power - law .",
    "this was explored by using a broken power - law for the emissivity function , with emissivity index @xmath53 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 and index @xmath56 from @xmath55 to @xmath57 .",
    "the fit parameters for this model are given in table  [ tab : fits ] ( model 3 ) .",
    "this fit is not physically self - consistent for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly it ignores the emission from fe k@xmath17 , which is expected at 7.05  kev .",
    "secondly , the high @xmath58 of the line is not consistent with our assumptions about the reflection component , namely that it has @xmath59 , @xmath20  deg , solar abundances and is neutral . in such circumstances , considering the observed value of @xmath60 , the predicted @xmath58 is only 140  ev ( george & fabian 1991 ) . two plausible possibilities are that the iron abundance in the accretion disc is higher than the solar value ( see e.g. lee 1999 ) , or that the reflection component is enhanced for some reason , for example due to anisotropy ( ghisellini 1991 ) or geometry ( fabian 2002 ) .",
    "the high abundance case was examined by fixing the iron abundance of the reflector to @xmath61solar in model 3 .",
    "this in fact improved the overall fit compared to the solar abundance case ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "changes in the disc line parameters were negligible .",
    "the value of the cutoff energy can affect both the high energy spectral shape and the apparent strength of the reflection component .",
    "allowing @xmath63 to be free in this fit gave @xmath64  kev ( @xmath65 ) . allowing @xmath14 to be a free parameter further improved the fit , therefore this was also left free in model 4 .    model 4 comprised a power - law plus cold reflection ( with overabundant iron , @xmath16 ) , emission from iron k@xmath10 ( 6.40  kev ) and k@xmath17 ( 7.05  kev ) .",
    "the reflection plus line spectrum was then blurred using the laor kernel ( with a broken power - law emissivity function ) . a narrow emission line at @xmath66  kev ( fixed ) was also included in the model .",
    "this provided the best fitting model , with a cut - off energy @xmath67  kev and @xmath68 , the other parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits ] .",
    "the model and fit residuals are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_with_sax ] and the `` fluxed '' line profile based on this fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxed_line ] .    including an absorption line instead of a 6.9  kev emission line gave a slightly poorer fit ( @xmath69 ) with line parameters @xmath70  kev , @xmath71  ev ( consistent with the prediction of sako 2002 ) , and slight changes to the relativistic line parameters ( in particular @xmath72 ) .",
    "as a first test for spectral variability around the iron line region pn spectra were extracted from 10  ks intervals around the minimum and maximum flux periods during revolution 301 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : one_orbit ] ) .",
    "the average continuum fluxes during these intervals differ by @xmath73 .",
    "the ratio of the two spectra is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] and shows clear signs of spectral variability . there is a slight depression around 6.4  kev , indicating the iron line core is stronger ( compared to the continuum ) in the low - flux spectrum .",
    "the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] shows the residuals from fitting a power - law model to the difference spectrum ( i.e. high - flux minus low - flux spectrum ) .",
    "the difference spectrum is consistent with a power - law in the range 2 - 10  kev and indicates the iron line flux changed little between the two intervals .",
    "a detailed analysis of the spectral variability properties will be given in a forthcoming paper but these first results are consistent with the simple two component continuum model described in shih ( 2002 ) .",
    "the suggestion that the iron line was not as variable as the continuum was borne out by an examination of the rms spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : rms ] shows the normalised rms variability spectrum derived from the revolution 302 pn data .",
    "the rms spectrum clearly shows that the fractional variability amplitude is suppressed at energies close to the iron line , compared to surrounding continuum bands ( see also inoue & matsumoto 2001 ) .",
    "a further point to note is that the rms spectrum ( and the ratio of high / low spectra ) are smooth in the 0.21.0  kev range .",
    "in particular , the absence of any feature at 0.7  kev in the spectral ratio is expected if the large drop at that energy ( fig  [ fig : mos_spectrum ] ) is due to absorption ( with constant optical depth ) . for the drop to be the blue wing of an emission line ( branduardi - raymont 2001 )",
    ", the line intensity must be responding linearly to the continuum flux ( unlike the iron line ) .",
    "an examination of the rgs spectra confirms this result .",
    "a long observation with  and  of  in its typical state has again confirmed the presence of the broad , skewed iron line .",
    "all the models considered above are formally acceptable ( @xmath74 ) , and all include emission within @xmath0 , consistent with emission from a disc around a spinning black hole .    model 4 provides the best ( in a @xmath75-sense ) and most physically self - consistent explanation of the data . in this model ,",
    "the disc emissivity is described by a broken power - law in radius , and it is interesting to note that the break radius occurs at @xmath76 . beyond this radius",
    "the disc has an emissivity profile @xmath77 and produces an iron line with an equivalent width @xmath78  ev ( the @xmath79  kev core of the line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxed_line ] ) , both close to the values expected from standard accretion disc models . within @xmath0",
    "the emissivity steepens , producing the strong low - energy tail to the line emission , also with an equivalent width @xmath78  ev , suggesting additional physics within this region beyond that expected from standard accretion disc models ( see wilms 2001 ) .",
    "the strong iron line is consistent with an enhanced reflection spectrum and an overabundance of iron or ionisation of the disc surface .",
    "this last possibility will be examined in a later paper .",
    "the iron line parameters do , however , depend slightly on the assumptions made about the complex absorption",
    ". in particular all the above models formally assume the effects of ionised absorption are negligible above 2.5  kev , which is correct for absorption due to low - z elements ( e.g. o ) but may not be true if there is absorption by higher - z elements ( e.g. si , s ) .",
    "a preliminary analysis allowing for the possibility of si and s edges did not change the requirement for a strong red wing to the iron line .",
    "a detailed analysis of the rgs data will yield constraints on the warm absorption ( particularly on the low z elements ) and help remove existing degeneracies .",
    "future work to determine the spin must include emission from the immediate plunge region inside the innermost stable orbit ( reynolds & begelman 1997 ; agol & krolik 2000 ) as well as returning radiation ( martocchia , matt & karas 2002 ) .",
