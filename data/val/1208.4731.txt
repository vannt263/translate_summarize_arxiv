    "[ fig3 ] , for example , @xmath137 is displayed as a function of the distance @xmath11 and for the ( relative ) collision energies @xmath161 = 1.8 , 2.0 and 2.2 mev / u .",
    "as seen from the figure , the steep rise of the ionization probability appears immediately after the point of closest approach @xmath162 at which the ( relative ) ionic motion is suddenly reversed and the electron can be `` shaken off '' into the continuum .",
    "such a behaviour of the @xmath137 as well as its further damped oscillations have been predicted previously in ref .",
    "@xcite based on the monopole approximation and now is confirmed by our theory that accounts for the multipole expansion of the electron  nuclei interaction .",
    "moreover , our calculations clearly indicate a rise of the ionization probability with the collision energy .",
    "for example , the asymptotic value of the @xmath137 is increased by almost factor of _ three _ if the initial ( relative ) energy changes from 1.8 to 2.2 mev / u .",
    "further significant enhancement of the @xmath137 is predicted for higher energies at which the `` diving '' of the ground quasi  molecular state into the dirac s negative continuum takes place @xcite .",
    "however , since the analysis of such strong  field phenomena is out of scope of the present paper , we restrict here our calculations to the `` undercritical '' energy range , @xmath163 mev / u .",
    "in summary , we have laid out a theoretical approach to the time  dependent two  center dirac problem .",
    "within such an approach , the wavefunctions , describing the ( single ) electron dynamics in the field of two moving nuclei , are expanded in terms of solutions of the stationary dirac equation ( [ eq : time - independent_problem ] ) . we have argued that these stationary solutions can be efficiently constructed in _ spherical _ coordinates and for each internuclear distance @xmath11 by means of the two  step procedure .",
    "the first step of the procedure consists of employing the dual kinetically balanced ( dkb ) b  spline basis set method to find eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian @xmath164 , which accounts for the spherically ",
    "symmetric part of the electron ",
    "nuclei interaction . on the basis of these functions we generate , in the second step , the required solutions of the stationary two  center problem .",

    "the negative and positive values of @xmath11 correspond to the times when ions approach and move away from each other , respectively .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    the developed time ",
    "dependent approach can help to explore various atomic processes accompanying slow ion collisions . in the present work ,",
    "for example , we used this theory to calculate the electron  loss probabilities for the ( i ) @xmath2decay of hydrogen  like xenon , gadolinium and polonium ions , and ( ii ) u@xmath12u@xmath13 scattering at zero impact parameter .",
    "the @xmath2decay , being an example of charge ",
    "asymmetric collisions , can be described sufficiently well within the framework of first ",
    "order perturbation theory .",
    "calculations based on this theory have been used to prove the accuracy of our non  perturbative approach . for the @xmath0 and @xmath1shell @xmath2decay ",
    "induced ionization , predictions of both perturbative and non  perturbative methods were found to agree to within about 5 % if the multipole expansion of the two  center potential is taken into account in the time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian ( [ eq : dirac_hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "if , in contrast , this potential is approximated by its monopole term , our calculations may underestimate the ionization probabilities by more than 30 % ; this failure of the monopole approximation becomes most pronounced for large internuclear distances . based on these findings we stressed the vital importance of the proper treatment of the electron ",
    "nuclei interaction for the accurate description of slow ion ",
    "ion collisions . the rigorous `` multipole '' approach has been employed then to explore the @xmath0shell ionization accompanying u@xmath12u@xmath13 collisions . for this  purely non  perturbative  process , we qualitatively confirmed the impact ",
    "behaviour of the ionization probability , which was predicted previously by betz and co - authors @xcite within the monopole theory .",
    "both the @xmath2decay of hydrogen  like heavy ions and the u@xmath12u@xmath13 scattering have been explored in the present work for the case of _ zero _ impact parameter . of course ,",
    "the developed non  perturbative method is not limited to such a simple geometry and can be applied to analyze heavy ",
