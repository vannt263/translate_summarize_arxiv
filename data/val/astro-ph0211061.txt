    "when active volcanism was discovered on io with the voyager spacecraft in 1979 it was soon speculated whether tiny dust grains entrained in io s plumes might be ejected into circumjovian space by electromagnetic forces [ ] .",
    "no observational proof for this mechanism , however , was available at that time . in 1992",
    "streams of dust particles originating from the jovian system were discovered with the dust detector on - board the ulysses spacecraft [ ] .",
    "the dust streams consist of approximately 10 nm sized , electrically charged , dust grains [ ] , and they were later shown to originate from io [ ] .",
    "these tiny grains gain energy from the corotational electric field of the magnetosphere and escape from jupiter with speeds exceeding @xmath0 .",
    "the stream particles were also detected by the galileo and cassini spacecraft . since 1996",
    "galileo made 33 orbits about jupiter and provided a long record about the temporal and spatial variability of the ejected dust fluxes .",
    "these observations show a large orbit - to - orbit variation due to both systematic and stochastic changes .",
    "systematic effects include io s orbital motion , changes in the geometry of galileo s orbit and in the magnetic field configuration due to the rotation of the planet .",
    "stochastic variations include fluctuations of io s volcanic activity and the deformation of the outer magnetosphere in response to the variable solar wind conditions . using the long record of galileo s dust measurements , the variability due to stochastic variations",
    "can be approximately removed by ` averaging ' .",
    "time series analysis of the data collected through the first two years of galileo in orbit about jupiter revealed that the intensity of the dust fluxes is modulated by both io s orbital period and jupiter s rotational period , even though these could not be easily recognized in single orbits [ ] . in this paper",
    "we examine the average spatial dependence of the dust emission pattern using the entire galileo data set . based on our earlier modeling [ ] ,",
    "we expect a strong asymmetry in the dust emission pattern due to the asymmetry of the parameters of the io plasma torus .",
    "the plasma torus shows a dawn - dusk brightness asymmetry that is most likely the result of a large scale cross tail electric field related to the global flow pattern in the plasma tail of jupiter [ ] .",
    "the dawn - dusk electric field shifts the entire plasma torus by @xmath1 ( jupiter radius @xmath2 ) in the dawn direction , resulting in a higher plasma temperature on the dusk side .",
    "the charge of a dust particle escaping the plasma torus is a function of io s position in both magnetic and inertial coordinates , reflecting the plasma density and temperature variations along io s orbit .",
    "the cross - tail electric field is small compared to the co - rotational electric field and its direct effect on the dynamics of the dust particles is small .",
    "however , the displacement of the plasma torus leads to a strong dawn - to - dusk asymmetry in the plasma parameters that influences the escape of the dust particles .",
    "the charge carried by a dust grain will not stay constant as it travels through the io plasma torus .",
    "its charge is governed by a balance between electron and ion currents and secondary and photoelectron emission currents which are all functions of the plasma parameters , material properties , size , velocity and the instantaneous charge of a dust particle [ ] . for sufficiently high electron temperatures , secondary electron production becomes important so that incoming electrons can generate more than one outgoing secondary electron .",
    "hence , the net current can turn positive [ ] . in general , the charges of the grains are more positive on the dusk side of the torus where the electron temperature is higher . numerical simulations [ ] show that dust particles starting on the dawn side of jupiter remain captured by the io torus for some time whereas particles released at the dusk side have a higher chance to escape .",
    "this leads to a strong variation of the expected dust flux with jovian local time even if the dust ejection rate of io remains constant .",
    "the galileo dust measurements since 1996 provide a unique opportunity for long - term in - situ studies of the jovian dust environment . in this paper",
    "we analyze this six - year dust data set for systematic variations with jovian local time and compare our observations to our current models .",
    "galileo is a dual - spinning spacecraft with an antenna that points anti - parallel to the positive spin axis ( psa ) . during most of galileo s",
    "orbital tour about jupiter the antenna pointed towards earth .",
    "the galileo dust detector system ( dds ) , like its twin on - board ulysses , is a multi - coincidence impact ionization detector [ ] which measures submicrometer- and micrometer - sized dust particles .",
    "the dds is mounted on the spinning section of galileo and the sensor axis is offset by an angle of 60   from the psa .",
    "dds has a 140  wide field of view .",
    "thus , during one spin revolution of the spacecraft , the detector scans the entire anti - earth hemisphere , whereas particles approaching from the earth - ward hemisphere remain undetectable .",
    "the dust detector and the procedure for identification of jupiter stream particles in the galileo dust data set have been frequently discussed in the literature and are not repeated here [ ] . in this paper we will use class  3 ( our highest quality class ) and de - noised class  2 dust data [ ] . the galileo trajectory about jupiter",
    "is shown in a jupiter - centered coordinate system in fig .",
    "the spacecraft orbit is aligned along the planet s equatorial plane to within a few degrees . due to the planet",
    "s orbital motion about the sun , the line of apsides shifts by 360within one jovian year ( 11.9 earth years ) .",
    "since 1995 , when galileo was injected into a bound orbit about jupiter , the line of apsides has shifted clockwise by more than 180 .",
    "this allowed for dust measurements at varying jovian local times .",
    "the jovian dust streams have been detected with dds during all 33 galileo orbits about jupiter . due to the dds detection geometry ,",
    "dust stream particles could be mostly detected in the inner jovian system , i.e. within @xmath3 from the planet , with a varying detection geometry from orbit to orbit . only after mid-2000 was the detection geometry significantly different so that dust stream particles could be detected during almost the entire galileo orbit including apojove ( cf .",
    "dds was operated continuously during galileo s orbital tour , and highly time resolved real - time science ( rts ) data were received from the instrument during most of the time periods when the geometry allowed for detection of the dust streams .",
    "dust fluxes measured in the inner jovian system are shown in fig . 1 superimposed upon the galileo trajectory .",
    "in these time periods and spatial region the dust flux varied by more than four orders of magnitude ( @xmath4  @xmath5 ) . in order to calculate dust fluxes ,",
    "the effective spin - averaged dds sensor area [ ] had to be taken into account , which did not remain constant as galileo moved about jupiter .",
    "the time - dependent sensor area was calculated by taking the trajectory of a 10  nm particle as a standard  trajectory : particles of this size best explain the observed impact directions of the streams [ ] . when no dust flux is superimposed upon the galileo trajectory in fig .",
    "1 , the dust streams were either not in the field of view of dds or the spin - averaged effective sensor area was too small ( below @xmath6 which is less than 10% of the maximum value ) so that large uncertainties in the derived flux would occur .",
    "no rts dust data were collected during galileo orbits 5 ( jan 1997 ) and 13 ( feb 1998 ) and a few short intervals of spacecraft anomalies ( safings ) .",
    "= 0.96    the sensitivity of dds has changed over time due to radiation - related aging effects in the instrument electronics . this instrument degradation has been revealed from an analysis of the electronics response to simulated charge signals generated by a test pulse generator which is part of the dds .",
    "this change of the instrument response is consistent with a gradual shift of the charge signals measured for the jovian dust streams during the galileo jupiter mission [ ] .",
    "the drop in sensitivity has been about a factor of 5 since galileo s early jupiter mission in 1996 . by assuming a size distribution of the particles , a correction for the flux has been calculated and applied to the data : taking the impact charge distribution measured for stream particles in 1996 ( [ ] , their fig .",
    "6 ) when the instrument still had its nominal sensitivity , the flux correction factor is one in 1996 and rises up to 25 in early 2002 .",
    "figure 1 shows some systematic trends : some adjacent orbits show similar dust fluxes at comparable spatial locations , but others do not . in order to search for systematic variations with jovian local time ,",
    "we show the dust flux vs. local time for each orbit in fig .",
    "2 . due to the orbital motion of galileo ,",
    "these data were collected at different distances from jupiter as is indicated by contour lines . for a source with a constant dust ejection rate and assuming continuity , one expects the dust flux to drop with the inverse square of the source distance .",
    "therefore , in addition to the corrections discussed above , the fluxes shown in fig . 2 have been multiplied by @xmath7 ( @xmath8 being the distance from jupiter ) to eliminate the distance dependence of the flux due to the motion of galileo .",
    "= 0.99    an additional cause for temporal flux variations is the dust source io itself : for example , during orbits 4 and 21 , at distances between 15 and 30 @xmath9 , dds measured the highest dust fluxes in the inner jovian system during the entire galileo mission , whereas earlier and later adjacent orbits showed significantly lower fluxes .",
    "these variations are likely due to changes of the dust ejection of io s volcanic plumes .",
    "however , a correlation of io dust production with plume activity could not yet be established ( see also [ ] ) . in spite of such orbit - to - orbit variability ,",
    "systematic trends with jovian local time are obvious in fig .",
    "2 : higher fluxes occurred on the dawn side of jupiter whereas very low fluxes were typically measured around noon .",
    "flux variations from orbit to orbit caused by changes in the io dust production are expected to cancel out when averaging over the entire galileo dust data set is performed .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "3 : the bottom panel shows the dust flux for all galileo orbits averaged over half - hour local time intervals . before adding all flux measurements in a half - hour local time bin , the dust flux for each orbit was normalized to a range between 0 and 1 . due to this normalization , the flux correction for instrument aging does not have an effect on the averaged flux curve . due to the changing detection geometry of dds during the galileo mission , the number of orbits available for averaging varied with local time ( cf .",
    "2 ) . in order to avoid extreme flux values from individual orbits to appear in the average flux curve , an average data point",
    "is only shown when flux measurements are available from at least three galileo orbits .",
    "therefore , no data are shown between 20 and 24  h local time .",
    "in addition , flux measurements with an effective sensor area below @xmath10 were ignored .",
    "the dust flux measurements from the entire galileo mission presented in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 show a strong local time dependence : high fluxes occurred between 0 and 6  h and between 15 to 18  h. systematically fewer particles were measured between 8 and 15  h.    = 0.71",
    "we now compare the galileo dust measurements with dynamical modeling [ ] .",
    "dust particles in the size range from 5 to 15  nm were released from io uncharged with the same initial velocity as io s velocity at the time of their ejection .",
    "their charging and dynamics was followed numerically .",
    "the grains get charged in the io plasma torus and their probability to escape the torus strongly depends on io s position at the time of particle release [ ] .",
    "jupiter s magnetic field has been described using the gsfc  @xmath11 or vip  4 model [ ] .",
    "jupiter s plasma has been approximated using a plasma model , which is a fit to the voyager  1 and 2 plasma measurements [ ] .",
    "the local time dependence of the probability of the particles crossing ganymede s orbit ( @xmath12 ) within @xmath13 above / below the equatorial plane of jupiter is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "the data remarkably confirm the theoretical expectations : the local time dependence of the flux is well in agreement , even the factor of @xmath14 contrast of the dust fluxes between 5 and 12  h local time is seen in the data .    from the current study alone",
    ", we can not distinguish between io as a point source or the entire plasma torus as a ring source .",
    "in fact , the long - term averaging effectively smears io dust into a ring .",
    "this study shows that the plasma model , the description of the charging processes and the dynamics of the grains used in our model to describe dust production from io and its torus does reproduce the long - term averaged behavior of the observations . in particular ,",
    "the plasma conditions in the io torus are well represented as they are crucial for dust charging there .",
    "models without the torus dawn - dusk asymmetry do not show any local time dependence of the dust flux .",
    "thus , dust stream particles can be used as tracers for the plasma conditions in the io torus .",
    "for example , we plan on using the direction and the magnitude of the dawn - to - dusk displacement as free parameters to fit the simulation results to the observations .",
    "hence , comparing the local time dependence of the measured flux to the theoretical expectations allows for using dust measurements to independently confirm the direction and the magnitude of the cross - tail electric field . in the same way the dust particles may also serve as probes of the jovian magnetosphere .",
    "our distance correction with @xmath15 assumes an average source distance of jupiter , consistent with a smeared out ring source of the io torus .",
    "we also applied a correction factor @xmath16 to the data , assuming a particle source at the io torus location .",
    "this does not significantly change the data in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "it even increases the contrast between 5 and 12  h local time .",
    "we have also searched for systematic variations of particle size with local time in the galileo dust data set .",
    "although the dust stream particles are not in the calibrated mass and speed range of the dust instrument [ ] , the charge released upon impact of the dust grains onto the detector target can be used as an indicator for particle size .",
    "the data indicate a systematic variation of impact charge with local time , although much less pronounced than in the case of the dust flux . together with our simulations",
    ", this may also lead to better constraints of the plasma conditions in the io torus .",
    "here we have taken the entire dds data set to average over flux variations from one orbit to the next in order to identify changes due to systematic variations alone .",
    "the understanding of these systematic changes will allow us to ` remove ' them from the data and to identify the ` true ' temporal variability of io and the plasma torus .",
    "complementing our earlier time - series analysis , our results also confirm that io and its plasma torus are the source for the majority ( if not all ) of the dust stream particles .",
    "this source alone gives an excellent fit to the observed spatial dependence of the dust fluxes , a significant contribution from an extended source , the gossamer ring , for example , or any other moon would show a different ejection pattern .",
    "a competing suggestion for the source of the stream particles was the gossamer ring region of jupiter . here",
    "the plasma density is expected to be very low , hence the dominant charging process is photoelectron production from the grains . as the charging environment remains axially symmetric , grains",
    " if ejected from this region  would show a uniform ejection pattern .",
    "in addition to the galileo dust measurements within jupiter s magnetosphere , the dust streams were also detected with three dust instruments in interplanetary space ( ulysses , galileo and cassini ) .",
    "the local time variation of the dust flux found in the inner jovian magnetosphere may at least partially explain why galileo ( approaching jupiter from @xmath17 local time ; [ ] ) has measured on average higher fluxes than ulysses ( approaching from @xmath18 ; [ ] ) . in 2004",
    "ulysses will approach jupiter to 0.8  au again and will be able to measure the jovian dust streams at varying local times and jovigraphic latitudes . although the interplanetary magnetic field affects the dynamics of the stream particles [ ] , the imprint of the local time variations may show up that far from its origin .    in summary , we now recognize the escaping dust particles as a promising new diagnostic tool to characterize the average properties of the jovian magnetosphere , as well as the temporal variability of its most important source : io .",
