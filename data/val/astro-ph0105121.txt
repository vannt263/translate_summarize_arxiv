    "0.08truecm       a detailed discussion of expected gaia performances will necessarily be postponed to the end of the present series , when enough stars will be investigated to cover the span of spectral types and kinds of interaction ( detached , semi - detached , contact ) .",
    "this will provide us with a representative sample of the huge zoo of eclipsing binary stars within the observational capabilities of the coming esa cornerstone  6 mission .    nevertheless , a few brief statements are in order to comment on the promising results on well detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries of a , f spectral types of a few days orbital period obtained here .      in this paper we used a mean of 23 spectra per star , spread over a wide range of s / n .",
    "table  2 ) .",
    "orbital separations and individual masses are constrained to @xmath30.7% and @xmath31.5% , respectively .",
    "thus the selected @xmath4250   wavelength range between 8490 and 8740   is working fine for spectral types a and f , even though it was optimized for cooler stars ( the vast majority of field stars in the range of magnitude of interest to gaia are g and k stars ) .",
    "gaia will record the majority of its spectra at s / n lower than obtained for this paper , but this will be compensated by a much larger number of spectra per star , typically 150 .",
    "it is therefore quite possible that a sizeable fraction of the well detached , double - lined eclipsing binaries of a - f spectral type observed by gaia will have their orbital separation and masses of both components determined to an accuracy of @xmath31% provided that the spectral dispersion and resolution will be not too far from 0.25  / pix and 0.5  , respectively .",
    "the baricentric velocities are constrained to better than 0.5 km sec@xmath5 , which is fine in comparison to the accuracy of gaia tangential motions , and also adequate to resolve the internal kinematics of stellar aggregates ( clusters , associations , etc . )        for the program stars we adopted @xmath6 because modeling excluded any eccentricity larger than 0.01 , which can be taken as a rough indication of the accuracy to which eccentricity could be determined by gaia observations .",
    "periods for the three program stars have been determined to such an accuracy that it would take @xmath7170 years ( on the average ) to bring the ephemeris out of phase for more than 10%  of the orbital period .",
    "the 5 years of gaia operation ( compared to the time span of 3.36 years for hipparcos data or 1.38 years for the spectral data used here ) , should expand the 10% accuracy horizon of the ephemeris to @xmath7250 years .",
    "hipparcos has collected about 110 measurements per star .",
    "if eclipses last for 1/10 or less of the orbital period , one has to expect 10 or less photometric points to be distributed over the eclipse phases .",
    "gaia will have three lines of view ( at @xmath3120 deg ) .",
    "if the same set of core photometric bands is present in _ all _ the three channels ( a feature yet to be optimized in the currently baselined gaia design ) , the number of collected photometric points will proportionally increase with great benefit not only to the study of eclipsing binaries but also to variable stars in general .",
    "effective temperatures and surface gravities are in fact two of the basic output of spectral synthesis analysis ( e.g.  based on kurucz model atmospheres ) .",
    "the 0.25  / pix dispersion and 0.5   resolution gaia spectra used here are quite adequate to derive temperatures to @xmath830  k and gravities to 0.1 dex ( cf .",
    "munari and castelli 2000 ) .",
    "the analysis of gaia spectra of eclipsing binaries ( mainly those obtained at quadratures when spectra of both components are better observed ) would therefore provide these quantities directly .    the effective temperature and surface gravity determined directly from gaia spectra",
    "could then be used to check _ a posteriori _ the results of modeling or used as inputs in the modeling process to decrease the number of variables .",
    "a natural check about the goodness of the orbital solution and modeling is to compare the distance to the program stars computed from the modeling parameters in table  4 with the trigonometric parallaxes measured by hipparcos .",
    "this is done in table  5 , together with the distance to v505  per from the modeling of marshall et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "the high expected performances of gaia observations are confirmed : ( @xmath1 ) the modeling of photometric lightcurves and radial velocity curves for the three program stars constrains the distance to a better accuracy than hipparcos trigonometric parallax , and ( @xmath2 ) modeling distances and hipparcos parallaxes agree inside the respective errors .    as for the effective temperature and surface gravity , trigonometric parallaxes determined directly by gaia ( at an average 200@xmath9 better precision than hipparcos )",
    "could then be used to check _ a posteriori _ the results of modeling or used as an input value in the modeling process itself .",
    "the unique characteristic of gaia as a single mission which combines astrometry , spectroscopy and photometry appears to offer special advantages compared to the classical ground - based approach to eclipsing binaries .",
    "the possibility to use effective temperatures , surface gravities and trigonometric parallaxes as fixed input values to the modeling of lightcurves and radial velocities should allow more confident derivation of other parameters , both stimulating a new modeling approach to eclipsing binaries and also granting lower errors to the solution .    by probing all constituents of the galaxy ( halo , disk , bulge ) and detecting eclipsing binaries there",
    ", gaia can foster an epochal leap in our knowledge of the basic stellar parameters and how they vary with mass , age and chemical abundance .",
    "this will be true not only on statistical grounds ( given the huge number of observable eclipsing systems ) but also for an object by object approach .",
    "this paper has in fact shown that an accuracy of 1% in the derived stellar parameters can be achieved by gaia on a fraction of the detached eclipsing binaries observed during the mission .",
