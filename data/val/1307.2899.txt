    "as stars hurtle along their orbits around the galaxy , they pass through a diverse array of interstellar medium ( ism ) environments , ranging from dense molecular clouds ( e.g. , molecular knots in orion , @xmath1 @xmath2 ; @xcite ) to rarefied regions , heated and largely vacated by strong supernovae or stellar winds ( as seems to be the case with the local bubble , @xmath3 @xmath2 ; @xcite ) .",
    "such a dramatic variation in the characteristics of the local interstellar environment of stars can have a profound impact on the conditions in the volume occupied by planets .",
    "a balance of the pressures , between an outward moving stellar wind and the inward confinement of the surrounding interstellar material , defines an interface , the boundary between the star and the rest of the universe . in the case of our sun , this interface , or heliopause , is located at approximately 300 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , a direct consequence of the properties of the local interstellar medium ( lism ) and the solar wind ( i.e. , their density and velocity ) .",
    "changes in the extent of the heliosphere occur over a multitude of time scales . in the short term",
    ", the solar wind strength fluctuates over its 22-year magnetic cycle while solar flares and coronal mass ejections can drive variability on even shorter time scales .",
    "coronal activity has the potential to asymmetrically modify the morphology of the heliosphere .",
    "an event like this occurred in 2003 and was recorded by instruments aboard voyager 1 @xcite . on longer time scales ,",
    "a gradual change in the solar wind strength will occur over the 10-billion - year life span of the sun .",
    "observations of other solar type stars suggest that the historical solar wind may have been @xmath050@xmath4 stronger than it is today @xcite .",
    "however , the most dramatic driver of the structure of the heliosphere originates outside its boundaries ( i.e. , the properties of the surrounding ism ) .",
    "currently the sun is moving through a large ( @xmath5 @xmath0 100 pc ) , hot ( @xmath6 k ) , and low density ( @xmath7 @xmath2 ) cavity known as the local bubble",
    ". found within the local bubble are a collection of smaller ( 110 pc ) , higher density ( @xmath8 @xmath2 ) , cooler ( @xmath9 k ) , partially ionized clouds @xcite .",
    "given current solar velocity measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a cloud 1 pc in diameter would pass over the solar system in just 70,000 years .",
    "currently , the sun resides very near to the inside edge of one of these clouds referred to as the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) .",
    "given the relative velocity vectors of the sun and the lic , the sun will be transitioning out of the lic sometime in the next few thousand years @xcite .",
    "in fact , the farthest oort cloud objects might have already breached this boundary and moved into hot local bubble material .",
    "the local bubble is also home to clouds of much higher densities and cooler temperatures .",
    "the local leo cold cloud , a thin cloud first identified in 21  cm emission has recently been identified to be located between 11.3 and 24.3 pc away @xcite .",
    "this cloud appears to have a temperature of @xmath020 k and a density of @xmath03000 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "in addition , several of the mbm clouds @xcite , originally identified by 2.6 mm co emission , may be at or within the local bubble boundary . in particular , in roughly the same direction as the survey presented here , high - resolution observations of nearby stars",
    "were used to pinpoint the distance of mbm 20 @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive review of the lism is provided by @xcite .    given the pliable nature of the heliosphere and the configuration of our local galactic environment , several questions arise : how will the heliosphere respond when the sun exits the lic ?",
    "what would happen if the sun were to traverse a dense interstellar cloud , such as the local leo cold cloud ?",
    "the current paper develops the foundation for such an investigation by asking : what were the interstellar environments of the sun in its most recent past ?",
    "the implications of a dynamic heliosphere go well beyond structural changes and could be important for planets and their atmospheres .",
    "the relationship between our interstellar environment and the earth has interested researchers for almost a century .",
    "@xcite first formally suggested a link between the passage of the solar system through dense ism clouds and quasi - periodic climate catastrophes and mass extinctions of organisms on earth .",
    "as a testament to its broad appeal , theoretical speculations on this relationship have continued to this day @xcite .",
    "a recent compendium of articles related to the solar journey through the galaxy is given in @xcite .",
    "mechanisms invoked to link the ism and planetary atmospheres include : ( 1 ) fluctuations of cosmic ray flux modulated through the heliosphere , given that the solar magnetic field extends only as far as the termination shock ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; and ( 2 ) dust accretion directly onto planetary atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these processes have potential consequences for climate , ozone chemistry , and dna mutation rates for surface organisms ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "this work builds on a legacy of high - resolution ism observations in the optical .",
    "the strength of the and transitions has made them invaluable tracers of the ism , even when they are trace ions in interstellar gas ( as is the case in the lism , where for example , is the dominant form of calcium and is the dominant form of sodium ; @xcite ) .",
    "surveys have been made along sight lines toward most of the bright stars across the entire sky @xcite , of star - forming regions ( e.g. , orion ; @xcite ) , and of wide binaries used to search for small - scale structure in the ism along almost identical sight lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , as far as we know , this is the densest high - resolution absorption line survey of any particular direction through the ism .",
    "not only is this particular sight line of interest to understand the history of solar interactions with the surrounding interstellar gas , but also this survey provides a detailed and densely sampled look at the physical properties of the galactic ism .    a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) explores the potential consequences an encounter with the ism environments presented in this paper could have on the solar system .",
    "models of the heliosphere have been made to explore a wide range of different interstellar environments by @xcite .",
    "in particular , models were made using characteristics of the clouds in the lism , as well as the hot local bubble and cold dense molecular clouds .",
    "these models provide relations between the interstellar properties and heliospheric properties . here",
    ", we present observations of the interstellar clouds traversed by the sun and plan to use these relationships to make estimates of the historical heliospheric response ( and thereby the cosmic ray flux history on the earth s atmosphere ) in our companion paper .",
    "we defer additional discussion to paper ii , including the likelihood that the current interstellar column in the direction of the historical solar motion is identical with that of the actual interstellar environments traversed by the sun over that time . in this paper",
    ", we focus primarily on presenting the rich dataset and providing an analysis of the ism in this unique direction .",
    "stars were observed to measure ism absorption in the direction of the sun s path through the galaxy , out to a distance of @xmath0500 pc .",
    "the direction and velocity of the solar peculiar velocity were derived from @xcite , who measure the solar peculiar velocity from the _ hipparcos _ dataset ( see @xcite for an alternative analysis ) .",
    "the adopted values are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , in the constellation eridanus .",
    "the magnitude of the solar peculiar velocity is estimated to be @xmath12  km  s@xmath13 , which corresponds to a time of @xmath036.7 million years to traverse 500pc .",
    "this represents less than 1% of the total path length the sun traverses in a single orbit around the galaxy .",
    "this small percentage allows us to approximate the sun s recent historical trajectory as a straight line toward @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "stars for this study were chosen based on a close proximity ( @xmath16 ) to @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and properties that optimize ism absorption analysis ( e.g. , bright [ @xmath17 , rapidly rotating , early type [ b , a , f ] stars ) .",
    "we use the revised _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes presented by @xcite to calculate distances to our target stars , and restricted our sample to targets for which the relative error in distance is @xmath180.5 , whereas the median relative error is @xmath180.1 .",
    "this restriction led us to remove three targets ( hd30020 , hd29173 , and hd30076 ) .",
    "we observed two targets ( hd26574 , 37.31  pc ; hd26994 , 289  pc ) that were more than 9 degrees from the direction of the historical solar trajectory .",
    "hd26574 , the closer target showed no interstellar absorption , while hd26994 had absorption that was dramatically different from what was observed for the rest of our sample .",
    "for this reason , we decided to constrain our sample cone to @xmath199@xmath20 from the solar historical trajectory .",
    "a third target , hd32964 ( 66 eri ) , is a well - known short period binary ( @xmath21 days ; @xcite ) in which both stars displayed stellar absorption features at velocities at which we would expect to see lism absorption .",
    "because this target is only 94.7  pc away , and given the results from our entire sample , we would not expect to see any interstellar absorption since the closest target with detected absorption is 125.9pc and 112.9pc for and , respectively .",
    "therefore , we removed these targets from our sample .",
    "the remaining 43 targets are listed in table  [ stars ] and their distribution on the sky is illustrated in figure  [ angplot ] .",
    "data were obtained throughout the time period of october 2003 through october 2005 .",
    "absorption lines of neutral sodium ( d@xmath22 and d@xmath23 ; 5895.9242 and 5889.9510  ) and singly ionized calcium ( h and k ; 3968.4673 and 3933.6614  ) were chosen as the ism component tracers since they both have strong doublet resonance lines in the optical that are sensitive to nearby interstellar clouds .",
    "observations were made with the highest - resolution spectrographs available in each hemisphere . in the northern hemisphere , observations were taken with the harlan j. smith telescope ( hjst ) , a 2.7 meter telescope located at mcdonald observatory in west texas .",
    "observations were made at three separate resolution ( @xmath24 ) settings : ts12 : tull spectrograph ( @xmath25  400,000 ; @xcite ) , ts21 : cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph ( 2d coud ) focus 1 ( @xmath25  240,000 ; @xcite ) , and ts23 : cross - dispersed echelle spectrograph ( 2d coud ) focus 3 ( @xmath25  60,000 ; @xcite ) . in the southern hemisphere , observations were taken with the 3.9 meter anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , located at the anglo - australian observatory in australia .",
    "spectra were obtained with the ultra - high - resolution facility ( uhrf ) , an echelle spectrograph located at the coud focus ( @xmath25  940,000 ; @xcite ) . a subset of targets were observed multiple times at different resolutions and with both facilities to provide consistency checks on measurements of absorption profile parameters ( see section  [ multiple.resolution.observations.ss ] for a discussion of sight lines observed with multiple configurations ) .",
    "table [ obsparams ] lists the observational parameters for all data included in this study and is ordered by distance from the sun .",
    "the approximate continuum signal - to - noise ( @xmath26 ) ratio is given for each observation , as is the projected radial velocity of earth s atmosphere at the time of the observation .",
    "telluric features , both water vapor and sodium , can contaminate this spectral region , and are easily identified by their radial velocity .",
    "the data were reduced using image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ; @xcite ) and interactive data language ( idl ) routines to subtract the bias , flat - field the images , remove scattered light and cosmic - ray contamination , extract the echelle orders , calibrate the wavelength solution , and convert to heliocentric velocities .",
    "wavelength calibration images were taken using a th - ar hollow cathode before and after each target .",
    "the sodium region of the spectrum suffers from weak , but pervasive , telluric contamination from water in earth s atmosphere that must be identified and removed from the data , particularly for observations toward nearby stars that may be expected to exhibit weak interstellar absorption .",
    "a forward modeling technique demonstrated by @xcite was used to remove telluric line contamination in the vicinity of the d lines based on a terrestrial atmosphere model ( the atmospheric transmission [ at ] program , from airhead software , boulder , colorado ) developed by e. grossman .",
    "figure  [ twores ] shows a typical observed spectrum along with a fit to the telluric contamination .",
    "given that scores of telluric lines are involved in the fit , the telluric model is tightly constrained and highly successful at removing the water vapor contamination from our spectra .",
    "note that telluric lines are relatively absent in the vicinity of the d@xmath22 line at 5895.9242   , which further reduces any systematic influence of telluric features on the ism profile fit .",
    "observing both transitions of the doublet is an important confirmation that the telluric subtraction is successful . with two independent measurements of absorption at the same projected velocity ,",
    "it is easy to identify contaminating telluric lines .",
    "broad features remaining in the spectrum after telluric absorption removal are typically stellar absorption , which can be confirmed given the known stellar radial velocity and removed with a low - order polynomial to reveal the ism absorption .",
    "all absorption profiles were fit using standard methods ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this involves estimating the stellar continuum , determining the fewest absorption components required to obtain a satisfactory fit , convolving the absorption feature with an instrumental line - spread function , and fitting all lines of the same ion simultaneously .",
    "determining the stellar continuum is usually straightforward when one is dealing with high - resolution data , and systematic errors in this procedure are further reduced when multiple resonance lines of the same ion are fit simultaneously .",
    "figure  [ twores ] shows an example of a stellar continuum that is typically encountered .",
    "the continuum is slowly varying across the narrow wavelength range and easily fit with a low ( @xmath275 ) order polynomial .",
    "voigt absorption profiles are fit to and lines simultaneously using atomic data from @xcite .",
    "while the continuum is not fit simultaneously with the ism profile , in rare cases , the simultaneous ism profile fits highlighted discrepancies between the two transitions that could be resolved with a better continuum model . in these cases , an iterative approach to the continuum modeling was used .",
    "best - fit parameters are derived using a marquardt @xmath28 minimization technique @xcite .",
    "each sight line was initially fit with one component unless visual inspection of the spectrum strongly suggested the presence of multiple components .",
    "additional components were added until an f - test @xcite indicated that their inclusion was no longer statistically warranted .",
    "the final model spectrum is a convolution between these intrinsic voigt profiles and the instrumental line spread function .",
    "the final fit parameters for each absorber are the central velocity ( @xmath29 ) , the line width or doppler parameter ( @xmath30 ) , and the column density ( @xmath31 ) along the line of sight .",
    "errors on the fit parameters were derived from monte carlo simulations of the simultaneous fit . in order to evaluate the contribution of systematic errors",
    "we compare our fit errors with the standard deviation of fit parameters of the two transitions fit independently and the simultaneous fit , and use the larger of the two .",
    "table  [ caallcomps ] lists the final fit parameters for all individual absorbers , while table  [ catotecomps ] gives the total column density along each sight line .",
    "tables  [ naallcomps ] and [ natotecomps ] are the same for the observations .    figures [ 123 ] through [ 470 ] are the flux - normalized , best - fit results of the fitting process in the heliocentric rest frame , for each sight line in the sample with detected interstellar absorption , ordered by distance to each background star .",
    "absorption spectra for each line in both sodium and calcium doublets are shown , as well as each individual absorption component prior to convolution with the line - spread function .",
    "the hyperfine structure of is modeled , but only impacts the fits of observations taken at the highest spectral resolution @xcite .",
    "the fit to the total absorption profile is plotted after convolution with the instrumental line - spread function .",
    "our data set contains nine sight lines along which the ism absorption was measured multiple times at different resolving powers ( see table  [ multres ] ) . in almost all cases ,",
    "the highest - resolution observation was chosen to represent the ism absorption along the line of sight .",
    "figure [ twores ] shows an example of ism absorption toward the star hd28497 observed at different spectral resolution .",
    "spectra obtained at high resolution ( ts21 ; @xmath32  km  s@xmath13 ) resulted in a 10 component fit , validated by the f - test , while lower - resolution data ( ts23 ; @xmath33  km  s@xmath13 ) led to a fit consisting of only 6 components .",
    "however , the total column densities were essentially identical ( within @xmath00.3@xmath34 ) , where the ts23 observations yielded a total column density of @xmath35 , and the ts21 observations , @xmath36 .",
    "it is encouraging that we arrive at the same total column density , regardless of the resolution , and this provides confidence that we can safely compare the results of observations over the entire range of spectral resolution .    in our sample of multiply",
    "observed sight lines , more than 70% show agreement in the total column density to within 3@xmath34 .",
    "of those that are discrepant by @xmath373@xmath34 , all but one involve a column density derived from a high - resolution observation that is significantly less than that from a lower - resolution observation .",
    "this may result from differing accuracies in the line - spread functions or in the continuum placement .",
    "whatever the cause , the impact of such a systematic error is likely to be less in the highest - resolution data .    in terms of the comparison of individual component fits , while the gross profile is similar , not surprisingly , the narrowest features are lost in the low - resolution spectra .",
    "this is clearly seen in our complete sample , in which most of the narrow components are detected in our highest - resolution settings .",
    "however , detectability of narrow ism components is influenced by several other factors other than spectral resolution , including @xmath26 and degree of blending ( i.e. , proximity in radial velocity to another absorber ) .",
    "indeed , blending can be so severe , even in the highest - resolution spectra , that the weakest components are unable to be resolved in the fit .",
    "broad features , such as the shallow component near @xmath05890.4   ( at 23.5 km  s@xmath13 , and with a doppler parameter of 8.1 km  s@xmath13 ) in the bottom panel of figure [ twores ] are not necessarily representative of a single ism structure along that line of sight , but rather a blend of several small absorption features too weak to be resolved into individual components .",
    "it is precisely these narrow , weak components  perhaps tracing small but dense ism clouds  that we hope to identify in the historical solar path , and therefore , while our total column density measurements seem to support the use of a wide range of resolving powers , it is clearly advantageous to use the highest - resolving power possible .      while this work represents the first densely sampled ism survey in the direction of the historical solar trajectory , some of our targets had been observed before . of our sodium observations ,",
    "16 of 43 ( 37% ) had been previously observed , and in calcium , 15 of 43 ( 35% ) .",
    "most of these were taken as parts of much larger surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the relevant references are listed in tables  [ catotecomps ] and [ natotecomps ] . while these observations were taken using various instruments and analyzed by different researchers ( including some of the earliest high - resolution ism observations : @xcite ) , they nonetheless provide an interesting comparison .",
    "overall , in terms of the total column density , there is significant disagreement beyond the 3@xmath34 level in the majority of cases for , while most of the comparisons agree quite well . for",
    ", the most distant targets ( i.e. , the sight lines with the strongest ism absorption ) tend to agree more closely than the nearest sight lines .",
    "a likely explanation is that the systematic errors ( e.g. , continuum placement , number of assumed components ) overwhelm the statistical errors , particularly for sight lines with weak absorption , which is typical for nearby sight lines and observations .",
    "a systematic trend is evident when we compare individual analyses . in",
    ", our measurements are systematically higher ( by @xmath00.4 dex for 4 sight lines ) than those same sight lines analyzed by @xcite , while our measurements are systematically lower ( by @xmath00.2 dex for 6 sight lines ) than those analyzed by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of individual component fits shows excellent agreement in radial velocity and doppler parameter for the strongest components .",
    "determining the total number of absorbers appears to be the largest source of disagreement .",
    "strong absorbers may or may not be subdivided depending on the spectral resolution and @xmath26 of the data , and the analysis strategy of the researcher . given the unavoidable blending along distant sight lines , an accurate inventory of individual absorbers may not be possible , regardless of the quality of the data . herein lies the inherent limitation of the component fitting technique , and one which we tried to address by using the apparent column density method detailed in section  [ aodcol ] and using total column densities in section  [ totcol ] .",
    "however , if one looks at the profile shapes and integrates individual components into similar radial velocities bins , the agreement can be quite good . two sight lines ( hd34085 , @xcite ; hd28497 , @xcite ) , both of which were previously observed at high spectral resolution with the uhrf , make for good direct comparisons with our observations .",
    "for hd34085 in , we get an identical fit , differing only in how we interpreted the two most closely spaced blended components in the @xcite fit , less than 2 km  s@xmath13 apart , as a single absorber in our fit . similarly for ,",
    "while the full profile is in good agreement , we typically merge multiple neighboring components ( within a few km  s@xmath13 ) identified in @xcite into single components , resulting in our fit with 5 components to their fit with 12 components .",
    "however , the column - density - weighted radial velocities between our fits match extremely well .",
    "the same goes for the comparison with hd28497 , where we have slightly lower numbers of components for both ( we have 6 whereas @xcite have 10 ) and ( 10 versus 13 ) , but again , the column - density - weighted radial velocities match very well",
    ".    a detailed look at previous observations of the same sight lines highlight two important issues that are critical to this work .",
    "first , given the impact of systematic errors , it is important to have as close to a homogeneous data sample as possible and to have that data be analyzed uniformly by a single researcher .",
    "second , given unavoidable blending , the results of the traditional technique of fitting a discrete number of components to the absorption profile , need to be augmented by other techniques that can attempt to evaluate the intervening absorption independent of the number of assumed components ( see sections  [ aodcol ] and [ totcol ] ) .",
    "the final tally of our component fitting analysis yielded 141 individual ism absorption components in and toward 43 separate sight lines .",
    "the true number of ism absorbers is probably greater than this based on our inability to resolve the broad shallow components into individual absorbers ( 23% of all absorbers have @xmath38 km  s@xmath13 , mostly in ) .",
    "neutral sodium accounted for @xmath060% of all detected absorbers ( 85 components ) , and calcium the remaining @xmath040% ( 56 components ) .",
    "calcium components tend to be broader ( presumably tracing warmer gas ) and the @xmath26 lower than for , which could explain the lower number of components and higher percentage of broad components . the number of calcium components observed in any sight line with detected absorption ranges from 18 , with an average of 2.2 . for , the number of absorbers ranges from 110 , with an average of 2.8 . in order to compare individual components in both sodium and calcium , we identified paired components , in which the difference in measured interstellar radial velocity is @xmath193  km  s@xmath13 .",
    "those components that satisfy this requirement ( 36 in total , 64% of the sample and 42% of the sample ) are identified in the last column of tables  [ caallcomps ] and [ naallcomps ] .    of the 43 sight lines chosen for this study , the nearest 11 sight lines ( @xmath39 pc ) contain no detectable ism absorption .",
    "the observations of these nearest stars are consistent with the low - density interior of the local bubble , such that detectable quantities of both ions , particularly , are rare within approximately 100pc @xcite . stronger transitions of more abundant ions are needed to trace the interstellar clouds within the local bubble .",
    "this is possible only with access to high - resolution spectroscopy in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , where the vast majority of such transitions are found @xcite .",
    "figure [ hist ] shows the distribution of central velocities of all absorbers for the entire set of sodium and calcium observations . both the sodium and calcium component velocities range from approximately 40 km s@xmath13 to + 40 km s@xmath13 .",
    "the high number of components found around 23  km  s@xmath13 suggests the presence of a nearby interstellar cloud .",
    "such a large nearby cloud would be seen in absorption toward all stars at increasing distances .",
    "indeed , we associated this absorption with an absorber at or near the local bubble boundary , see section 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 ) .",
    "there is a consistent pattern between and , indicating that to a large degree they are both tracing similar collections of gas .",
    "figure  [ dv ] shows the difference in central velocity for our paired component subsample . while these were defined as paired components based on whether the difference in their velocities was @xmath193 km  s@xmath13 , the distribution of the velocity differences is typically much less and clearly peaks at zero .",
    "however , only 81% of the components are actually consistent with the zero velocity difference at 3@xmath34 . while it seems clear that there is often a strong correlation between the sodium and calcium absorption , it is not obvious that they are identically distributed .",
    "figure [ hist ] shows the distribution of measured line width , or doppler parameter , for each component .",
    "the high doppler parameter tail in both the sodium and calcium distributions is a reflection of our inability to resolve the weakest components in the interstellar absorption profile . as a result ,",
    "multiple weak absorbers that are likely present are blended into broad shallow components .",
    "although the total column density remains the same , it makes it difficult to assess the true number of absorbers and the true line widths . for the entire sample ,",
    "the median value of the doppler parameter for is 2.3 km  s@xmath13 whereas for it is 4.7 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "however , it is clear from figure  [ hist ] that a distinct population of small doppler parameter measurements differentiate themselves from the large doppler parameter tail . for",
    ", 61% of the components have @xmath40 km  s@xmath13 , with a mean of 1.5 km  s@xmath13 . for",
    ", 48% of the components have @xmath41 km  s@xmath13 , with a mean of 2.5 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "these values agree fairly well qualitatively with other all - sky surveys .",
    "@xcite find lower median values for ( 0.73 km  s@xmath13 ) and ( 1.31 km  s@xmath13 ) , but many of their components have had their doppler parameters fixed in order to converge on a consistent fit of severely blended lines , which may be biasing their sample to lower values .",
    "comparison of line widths of ions with different atomic weight that show absorption of the same gas can be used to estimate the temperature and turbulent velocity of that gas .",
    "thermal motions are inversely proportional to the atomic weight while turbulent motions are independent of atomic weight .",
    "this relationship is described in the following equation that relates the doppler width parameter ( @xmath30 [ in km  s@xmath13 ] ) to the temperature ( @xmath43 [ in k ] ) and nonthermal , turbulent velocity ( @xmath44 [ in km  s@xmath13 ] ) , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath47 is the mass of the ion observed , and @xmath48 is the atomic weight of the element in atomic mass units .",
    "@xcite did an extensive survey of temperature and turbulent velocity measurements of 50 absorbers within the lism using line widths of as many as 8 different ions .",
    "their results showed that all observed line widths could be satisfactorily fit with a self - consistent temperature and turbulent velocity .",
    "the atomic weight of calcium ( @xmath49 ) is significantly higher than that of sodium ( @xmath50 ) , therefore presenting an opportunity in the current survey to disentangle the thermal and turbulent broadening contributions .    as discussed above , the mean values of the doppler parameter for",
    "are significantly higher than those for . taken at face value ,",
    "this is inconsistent with both ions present in a single cloud , characterized by a single temperature and turbulent velocity .",
    "this is true for our paired component sample as well . in figure",
    "[ bs ] , the doppler parameter is plotted for both ions .",
    "the solid line indicates the relationship of doppler parameters if purely determined by turbulent motion ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) , whereas the dashed line indicates the scenario in which only thermal motions are included ( i.e. , @xmath52 ) . in reality",
    ", both thermal and turbulent motions likely contribute to the line width , and therefore a collection of gas that includes both ions should fall between these two lines . for our sample of 36 paired components , only 4 ( 11% )",
    "lie within this self - consistent region , which has been noted in other surveys of and ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this argues that these two ions are not well mixed , likely due to differences in the ionization and depletion structure of these two elements .",
    "however , based on the correlation in observed radial velocity of the components , it is clear that and are nonetheless correlated and may simply sample different regions of a typical interstellar cloud structure .    in figure",
    "[ hist ] , we convert the observed doppler line width into the maximum temperature of the gas , assuming that there is no contribution from nonthermal , or turbulent , broadening .",
    "if we ignore the high width tails to both distributions and look at the mean values given above in section  [ dp ] , the mean maximum temperature for is @xmath53 k , and for , @xmath54 k. clearly , is sampling a cooler , and likely less turbulent , interstellar material compared to .",
    "these maximum temperatures are likely significant overestimates of the true temperature , as there is always some contribution to the line broadening via turbulent motions , but serve as a stringent upper limit .",
    "the assumption that the sound speed can be used as an upper limit to the turbulent velocity , and therefore provide a lower limit to the temperature of the gas has been applied to evaluations of line widths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is reasonable for warm partially ionized clouds which typically have subsonic turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but may not be valid for cold neutral clouds probed by absorption which typically have supersonic turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    instead",
    ", here we make some reasonable assumptions about the contribution of the turbulent broadening in order to make a better estimate of the temperature of the gas .",
    "the lism is a convenient standard with which to evaluate .",
    "not only are the lines widths of many ions detected in the lism self - consistent along individual sight lines @xcite , but the entire collection of lism clouds also are very similar , and therefore , mean values of line widths of the entire sample are self - consistent , with an average temperature , @xmath55 k , and turbulent velocity , @xmath56",
    "km  s@xmath13 @xcite . note that this is subsonic turbulence , typical of warm partially ionized clouds .",
    "if we use this same turbulent velocity , for , this leads to a mean temperature in our sample of @xmath08300 k. this turbulent velocity is inconsistent with the average doppler width of observed in our sample , which again argues that is sampling a distinctly different interstellar environment .",
    "if instead , we use the turbulent velocity observed for the local leo cold cloud ( @xmath57 km  s@xmath13 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is quite small but supersonic as found for other cold neutral clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it leads to a temperature just slightly less than our maximum temperature , or @xmath03000 k. while perhaps correlated , the and appear to be sampling spatially distinct locations .",
    "figure [ hist ] shows the distribution of observed individual component column densities determined from our fitting procedure .",
    "a distinction here is made between observations with different instruments , which vary in spectral resolution and sensitivity .",
    "these both impact our detection limit .",
    "the vertical lines indicate those limits for each instrument , which are 3@xmath34 upper limits using the mean @xmath26 for observations taken with that instrument . in general , since ism lines are quite narrow , one gains significantly in sensitivity as one goes to higher spectral resolution .",
    "our calculations support this trend , other than for observations of with ts12 , which is significantly less sensitive than the other instruments used at this wavelength , and hence the detection limit is higher than would be expected .",
    "the number of weak absorbers is almost certainly underestimated due to the observational bias introduced by our sensitivity limits . as can be seen in the distribution , the vast majority of low column density absorbers",
    "are detected by our most sensitive ( and highest - resolving power ) instrument , the uhrf .",
    "the median observed column density is @xmath58@xmath59 , and the median observed column density is @xmath60@xmath61 . in figure",
    "[ hist ] , the column density has also been translated into a total hydrogen column density .",
    "even though much of the sodium is ionized , @xcite demonstrated a correlation exists between and the total hydrogen column density @xmath62 , over column densities consistent with our sample ( i.e. , @xmath63@xmath64 ) .",
    "the mean column density thus translates into a mean hydrogen column density of @xmath65 .    for the purposes of reconstructing the ism density along the historical solar trajectory , measurements of the column density of each individual absorbing cloud",
    "is of the utmost importance . in paper ii",
    ", we present an analysis that synthesizes our fits of individual absorbers into an assignment of specific interstellar clouds .",
    "however , we can evaluate the column density observed in this direction in even simpler terms which also avoid the bias of component identification .",
    "as discussed in section  [ multiple.resolution.observations.ss ] , we find that the total column density estimate is unaffected by spectral resolution of the spectrograph , but the identification of individual absorbers is a difficult task , often biased by choices made by the researcher .",
    "this is particularly true given the high level of complexity we observe even within a narrow observing cone .",
    "we use two techniques that should be relatively free of the choices we made in making the individual fits in order to characterize the variation of column density along the historical solar trajectory .",
    "the first is to use the apparent column density , and the other is to simply use the total column density .",
    "in order to characterize the column density structure along this line of sight independent of how individual components are fit to the absorption profile , we employed the apparent column density method described by @xcite . in this case , the interstellar absorption is analyzed by converting absorption line profiles into profiles of apparent optical depth , @xmath66 and apparent column density , @xmath67 , per unit velocity .",
    "this very quickly provides a diagnostic of the column density and velocity structure regardless of the degree of blending .",
    "apparent optical depth as a function of wavelength is obtained from equation [ tau ] , where @xmath68 is our normalized flux continuum ( 1 in our case ) , and @xmath69 is the absorption line profile for a particular observation ,    @xmath70 . \\label{tau}\\ ] ]    apparent optical depth is different from true optical depth in that the apparent optical depth has been blurred by the resolution of the instrument used to take the data . in our case , despite using a variety of instruments , they all were sufficiently high resolution that the instrumental impact on the apparent column density measurement is minimal .",
    "the apparent optical depth is a good approximation of the true optical depth when the instrument resolution is high , the continuum is well defined , and the measurements have a high signal - to - noise ratio , which is , in general , satisfied by all of our observations .",
    "when these conditions are met , @xmath71 , and we can make use of the relation between true optical depth and column density :    @xmath72    total column density can be found from @xmath73 and expressing total column density as a function of velocity , we can solve equation [ taul ] for @xmath74 and integrate , giving : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the mass of an electron , @xmath77 is the transition oscillator strength , @xmath78 is the speed of light , and @xmath79 is wavelength in ngstroms .",
    "apparent column density per unit velocity as a function of distance is plotted in figure [ aods ] for the sodium and calcium data . as was discussed above",
    ", the sodium column density has been translated into hydrogen column densities following the relationship derived by @xcite .",
    "the onset of detected absorption is at a similar distance for both ions and consistent with the edge of the local bubble at @xmath0120 pc . shortly thereafter",
    ", there is a strong absorption feature at @xmath023  km s@xmath13 that is consistently seen in absorption profiles at increasing distances .",
    "this suggests that there is a cloud at or near the edge of the local bubble taking up a significant portion of the sample area .",
    "given the peculiar motion of the sun ( 13.38 km  s@xmath13 ) , it will travel this equivalent distance in @xmath010 myr . unfortunately , and are largely insensitive to the warm , partially ionized clouds that are known to reside within the local bubble , which require uv spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "the sodium and calcium apparent column density plots look very similar , again arguing for a correlation in the spatial distribution of and .",
    "the broader profiles of are also evident in figure  [ aods ] .",
    "an additional technique to evaluate the column density along this unique direction is to work with the total observed column density .",
    "again , this is independent of the strategy of component fitting and appears robust to a wide range of resolving powers .",
    "the total column densities for sight lines in our sample are listed in tables [ catotesn ] and [ natotesn ] .",
    "figure  [ coldist ] displays these values as a function of distance .",
    "again , insensitive to the low column densities of the lism clouds within the local bubble , our nearest sight lines provide only upper limits .",
    "the edge of the local bubble is clearly seen at @xmath0120 pc , with a rapid increase in total column density , which quickly levels off .",
    "our measurements of the distance to the edge of the local bubble are in agreement with @xcite who did an all - sky survey of interstellar neutral sodium out to a distance of 500 parsecs .",
    "this sharp rise is most apparent in the sodium column density profile but is also seen in the calcium data .",
    "the error in the distance measurements is from _ hipparcos _ parallax measurements @xcite , and for this reason , the error bars tend to grow with distance as parallax becomes more difficult to measure .",
    "the spread in column densities at any given distance is likely an indication that we are observing small - scale structure variations in the ism across this relatively narrow observing cone . at the largest distances ( @xmath0500 pc ) , targets at the edge of our observing cone would be separated from the center by a physical distance of 80pc .",
    "these spatial variations could explain drops in the total column density for sight lines at larger distances in figure  [ coldist ] as well as the apparent disappearance and reappearance of absorbing components in the apparent column density profiles presented in figure  [ aods ] .    in order to evaluate the spatial variations in our sample",
    ", the total column density measurements were analyzed to see if a self - consistent series of absorbers within individual distance bins could replicate our observations .",
    "we used distance bins of @xmath19150 pc , 150200 pc , 200250 pc , 250350 pc , and 350700 pc .",
    "a minimum curvature surface interpolation is made using the measurements toward targets that fall within these distance bins .",
    "more distant targets provide limits to the column density of preceding distance bins .",
    "once a spatial map of column density is determined for the closest distance bin , it is subtracted from more distant sight lines and the procedure is repeated for the next distance bin . despite this being the most densely sampled high - resolution absorption line survey of an individual sight line , we are still left with only 43 pencil - beam measurements . given the large distances of some of our sight lines , the physical spacings can be quite dramatic .",
    "for example , in the farthest distance bin , with a mean distance of 525pc , the radius of our field of view ( @xmath80 ) is equivalent to 92.6pc , whereas for our closest bin with a mean distance of 125pc such an angular separation is only 22.0pc . nonetheless , a self - consistent model of the spatial variation of column density in both and can be made . the results are shown in figure  [ dslice ] . overall ,",
    "both ions show a similar , although not identical , spatial distribution . again",
    ", this argues for correlated , though not necessarily identical , distributions of and .",
    "additionally , significant structure is observed , highlighting the complexity of the ism and need for densely sampled surveys in order to characterize this complexity .",
    "neutral sodium and singly ionized calcium are two of the strongest resonance lines in the optical @xcite and have therefore been extensively used to diagnose the physical properties of the ism over a range of conditions . measuring the column density ratio of these two ions , which is relatively simple observationally , holds the promise of evaluating the impact of ionization and depletion , both of which will impact the ratio . in the diffuse , warm ism , both and are trace species , with and dominating @xcite .",
    "additionally , the two elements have very different condensation temperatures and therefore , have very different patterns of depletion onto dust , namely calcium is typically depleted in the gas phase by more than two orders of magnitude compared to sodium @xcite . for these reasons , the / column density ratio can vary by several orders of magnitude and potentially be a sensitive diagnostic of these phenomena . in our sample of paired components , we see column density ratios that range more than two orders of magnitude from @xmath81@xmath82@xmath830.06612 ( see figure  [ nrat ] ) , while even larger variations have been detected along other sight lines @xcite .    based on many studies of and ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the largest column density ratio ranges tend to be associated with cold ( @xmath84 k ) , dense interstellar clouds , where is prevalent , is rare , and calcium in general is significantly depleted onto dust .",
    "the lowest column density ratios are typically associated with warm ( @xmath85 k ) , high - velocity interstellar environments ( e.g. , supernova remnants and shells ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where dust has either been destroyed and the constituents returned to the gas phase , or where depletion has not yet initiated .",
    "we certainly see evidence to support this in our sample , in which the largest / values are located just beyond the local bubble boundary ( see figures  [ nrat ] and [ aodsrat ] ) , which delineates the warm , rarefied local bubble gas from dense molecular gas .",
    "our dense survey of nearby stars , which have accurate distance measurements , allows us to pinpoint the location of the high column density ratio gas .",
    "additional evidence of the physical conditions of gas with different / ratios comes in the form of the routly - spitzer effect @xcite , which is exemplified in a canonical figure of observed ism velocity versus column density ratio .",
    "we show this figure for our own sample at the top of figure  [ nrat ] .",
    "the highest / column density ratios tend to be at low velocity , whereas the highest velocities tend have low column density ratios .",
    "@xcite presented the interpretation that these high peculiar velocities could be signatures of old supernova remnants and that shocks associated with these remnants would preferentially destroy dust grains and enhance the gas phase calcium abundance , thereby lowering the / column density ratio .",
    "our sample also shows the canonical routly - spitzer effect , and the majority of the low column density ratio measurements are associated with our longest sight lines , which likely traverse a wide range of interstellar environments .",
    "finally , in figure  [ nrat ] , we also see a tight correlation between the / column density ratio and column density , which as mentioned above is correlated with hydrogen column density @xcite .",
    "while observational bias could influence this plot , as shown in figure  [ hist ] , our detection limits are low enough as to not significantly impact the observed correlation . instead",
    ", it is likely that the variation in calcium depletion is the cause of the correlation .",
    "the largest sodium column densities are likely indicative of the densest interstellar environments , in which calcium can be depleted by more than 3 orders of magnitude , whereas sodium maintains a modest depletion over a wide range of densities @xcite .    while these connections between the / column density ratio and other physical quantities imply a physical association , we know from the comparison of the doppler parameter shown in figure  [ bs ] , that and are not identically distributed . because they do not share an identical temperature or turbulent velocity",
    ", they can not be components of the same parcel of gas .",
    "@xcite made note of the inconsistent differences in the doppler parameter between sodium and calcium but , given the moderate spectral resolution of the observations , the larger line widths could be the result of component blending , which due to the routly - spitzer effect will be more significant for than .",
    "in essence , the low / column density ratio , for which , by necessity , there would be a strong signal , is also found at a wide range of velocities , and so the blending of these lines would lead to a large doppler width . however , as the spectral resolution of observations has improved , the low column density ratio sight lines have not resolved into a series of blended interstellar components . more than half of our paired sample were taken from the highest - resolution spectrographs used in this survey , and yet the line width discrepancy , @xmath86 still holds .",
    "this makes using the ionization and depletion to derive fundamental physical properties ( e.g. , electron density , temperature ) problematic .",
    "@xcite , using a series of photoionization models of the local interstellar medium , also emphasize the difficulty in using this ratio of trace species as a diagnostic of physical properties in warm partially ionized clouds .",
    "in addition , a third possibility needs to be explored to explain the observed / column density ratio , and that is geometry . because we do not know how and",
    "are distributed in space , the orientation of the absorbing clouds , particularly if they are filamentary , can have a significant impact on the / column density ratio .",
    "filamentary structures are quite common in the ism @xcite , presumably organized by the presence of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "so , for example , at the local bubble boundary , where there is likely to be interactions between the hot local bubble gas and the cold , dense molecular material , the orientation of structures at this interface may play a significant role in the large range of / column density ratios .      in this section ,",
    "we examine the subset of sight lines that are close in angle in order to search for evidence of small - scale structure in the ism along our observing cone .",
    "there are 5 sight line pairs that are within 1@xmath87 of each other and show ism absorption : hd30963hd31089 , 0.31@xmath20 ; hd30535hd30679 , 0.57@xmath20 ; hd27563hd27436 , 0.60@xmath20 ; hd28763hd28497 , 0.82@xmath20 ; hd28843hd29248 , 0.93@xmath20 . of particular note",
    "are the first two pairs listed ( hd30963hd31089 and hd30535hd30679 ) because they are within 2@xmath20 of the solar trajectory direction .",
    "a detailed comparison between the sight lines is not discussed here , as interested readers can easily make their own comparisons using the spectra in figures  [ 123][470 ] , and tables  [ caallcomps ] and [ naallcomps ] , but we do highlight a common occurrence in many of the pairs that argues for the existence of small - scale structure .",
    "excess absorption is often detected in the closer of the two targets , requiring that the absorption discrepancy between the sight lines occur interior to the nearest star .",
    "for example , hd30963 shows significant absorption at velocities @xmath1910 km  s@xmath13 , whereas hd31089 shows none , which is in contrast to the absorption near 20 km  s@xmath13 , which increases by about a factor of 3 between hd30963 and hd31089 .",
    "likewise , hd30535 , which is significantly closer than hd30679 , shows absorption near 20 km  s@xmath13 that is about twice that of the absorption at the same velocity in the more distant target hd30679 . finally , the last listed pair ( hd28843hd29248 ) is also of interest because it is the closest of the pairs , with stellar distances of 145.8pc and 207.0pc , respectively , and hence the distance errors are small ( @xmath1910pc ) .",
    "this pair also shows excess absorption ( near 0 km  s@xmath13 ) in the spectrum of the closer star for both and .",
    "for the three cases discussed above , the maximum size scale of the variation ( i.e. , the projected length between the two stars at a distance just interior to the nearest star ) , is 1.3 , 3.3 , and 2.4pc , respectively , although if the variation is assumed to be at the local bubble boundary at 120pc , the scale of ism variation is even smaller at only 0.6 , 1.2 , and 1.9pc , respectively .",
    "others sight line pairs of interest include those with small physical separations .",
    "these tend to be pairings of the closest targets at essentially identical distances .",
    "there are 13 pairs in which the physical separation is @xmath8815 pc .",
    "more than half of these include pairings between the targets within the local bubble and therefore , have no detected absorption . however , there are 5 pairings in which both have detected absorption , including hd28208 and hd28980 with a physical separation of 7.7 pc , and hd31512 and hd32249 with a separation of 9.4 pc . again , despite being at practically identical distances , there are significant differences in the ism absorption profile .",
    "the column densities differ by a factor of 3 between hd28208 and hd28980 , and by a factor of 2 between hd31512 and hd32249 .",
    "the is similar between the pairs , but still shows variations in observed velocity ( e.g. , hd28208hd28980 ) and component structure ( e.g. , hd31512hd32249 ) .",
    "variations in the ism on a small scale ( i.e. , sub - parsec ) have been found in many other observations , including wide binaries @xcite , and high proper motion pulsars @xcite . only in the very closest ism ,",
    "primarily observed in the uv using dominant ionization stage ions , do we see little evidence for small - scale structure , but instead coherent absorption over large angles @xcite . while a large coherent pattern of absorption is evident in our sample ( see figure  [ aods ] ) a detailed look at practically any pair of sight lines , shows significant discrepancies , indicating a fundamental complexity in the distribution and/or physical properties of the observed ism . in the context of reconstructing the ism along the historical solar trajectory ,",
    "this small - scale structure makes it very difficult to identify anything other than the largest structures .",
    "however , it motivates even more strongly the need to understand the interaction between stars and the ism through which they are passing because the abundance of small - scale structures implies that dramatic changes in the properties of our surrounding ism are a common occurrence .",
    "we performed the densest ism survey at high spectral resolution , observing 43 targets within 9 degrees of the historical solar trajectory out to a distance of @xmath0500  pc .",
    "observations were taken of and at resolving powers ranging from @xmath89 .",
    "we fit the absorption profiles with 85 and 56 components .    1",
    ".   component analysis is consistent between observations over a range of resolving powers , although the highest spectral resolution provides the highest sensitivity to narrow and low column density absorbers .",
    "the total column density appears insensitive to resolution among observations in our study and even to analysis strategy among similar observations analyzed by other researchers .",
    "however , the number of components , which has a significant impact on measured line widths , velocities , and individual column densities , is variable depending on resolving power , @xmath26 , and researcher .",
    "this argues for a homogeneous data set analyzed together , as has been done for this sample .",
    "in addition , we present two alternative techniques to assess the ism profile along the direction of the historical solar trajectory : the apparent column density and the total column density .",
    "3 .   the nearest significant ism absorber has a velocity of @xmath023 km  s@xmath13 and is located at @xmath0120 pc , which is consistent with the edge of the local bubble .",
    "this interstellar material would have been encountered by the sun @xmath010 myr ago .",
    "however , we know that significant interstellar material resides within this volume , including the lic , which defines the current structure of the heliosphere . these optical transitions are simply not sensitive enough to probe the very closest material , and therefore , to measure the ism that the sun encountered within the last few million years , we need spectroscopic observations in the uv .",
    "4 .   and do not seem to be identically distributed in interstellar clouds , as indicated by the inconsistency of the line widths , namely that @xmath90 , despite the fact that calcium has a higher atomic weight . nonetheless",
    ", the two ions do appear to be correlated , given the similarity in velocity structure and therefore , are likely constituents in related but distinct structures within a single ism cloud complex , with tracing warm ( @xmath08000 k ) gas and tracing cold ( @xmath193000 k ) gas .",
    "the / column density ratio shows the largest variation at the local bubble boundary , possibly due to the complexity of physical conditions near that interface ( e.g. , temperature , ionization , depletion ) or variations in orientation of the dissimilar distributions of and .",
    "given that these two ions are not identically distributed , it makes using the column density ratio problematic in evaluating ionization and depletion effects .",
    "indeed , the non - coincident spatial distribution of the and in these clouds , and their possibly independent orientation along the line of sight , may also have a large role in determining the column density ratio that is observed .",
    "significant spatial variation is detected , although individual absorbers are consistently detected in practically all sight lines ( e.g. , the 23 km  s@xmath13 component ) .",
    "a corollary to this conclusion is that small - scale structure is observed to be ubiquitous , again arguing for complexity in cloud structure or distribution . while this makes a reconstruction of the ism more difficult , it makes it clear that dramatic variations in interstellar density are a common occurrence and that understanding the interaction between the ism and the sun , together with the heliosphere and the planets , is important .",
    "the connection between the ism and ultimately planets , via a dynamic heliosphere is captivating , but also complex .",
    "the work presented here lays the foundation for evaluating this relationship by presenting observations and analysis of the interstellar medium along the historical solar trajectory , the material that the sun is likely to have interacted within the last @xmath040 million years .",
    "there are many additional questions and assumptions that must be addressed before one is able to use these observations to make predictions regarding the influence on planets .",
    "for example , an estimate of the volume density is critical , but difficult to obtain .",
    "we will explore several options in paper ii , including calculating the density using the column density and distance differences between the sight line where the absorption is first detected and the sight line just preceding in distance in which the absorption is not detected .",
    "alternatively , we can make order of magnitude estimates from assuming the spatial extent is comparable to the radial extent , or simply using canonical cloud sizes derived from other work .",
    "volume densities will then allow us to calculate heliospheric compression and the implications for phenomena that may affect planets ( e.g. , the cosmic ray flux ) .",
    "these topics are discussed more in depth in paper  ii .",
    "while this work is clearly tied to the sun and heliosphere , these same issues are at work for other planet - bearing stars and their own surrounding interstellar environments . indeed ,",
    "the vast majority of known exoplanets reside within @xmath0500 pc , and therefore are encountering interstellar clouds not all that different from those studied here .",

    "<S> over the course of its motion through the galaxy , our solar system has encountered many interstellar environments of varying characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> interstellar medium ( ism ) density variations spanning seven orders of magnitude are commonly seen throughout the general galactic environment , and a sufficiently dense cloud within this range has the potential to dramatically alter the structure of the heliosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we present observations of the ism environments the sun has most recently encountered based on high - resolution optical spectra toward nearby stars in the direction of the historical solar trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> the data were obtained with the highest - resolution spectrographs available , including the tull spectrograph on the harlan j. smith telescope at mcdonald observatory and the ultra - high - resolution facility on the anglo - australian telescope at the anglo - australian observatory . </S>",
    "<S> observations were made of interstellar and doublet absorption toward 43 bright stars within @xmath0500 pc . </S>",
    "<S> no absorption is seen out to a distance of 120 pc ( consistent with the outer boundary of the local bubble ) , but a complex collection of absorbers is seen in stars beyond 120 pc . while common absorbers are consistently seen in most sight lines , significant spatial variation is also detected , even between closely spaced sight lines . </S>",
    "<S> this pervasive evidence of small - scale structure not only speaks to the complexity of the morphology or physical properties of the gas in the ism , but also emphasizes that dramatic structural changes to the heliosphere are common and it is important to understand the implications of such changes , such as the modulation in the cosmic ray flux , on planets . </S>"
