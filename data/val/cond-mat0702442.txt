    "the suggestion of stwalley and nosanow  @xcite in 1976 that electron - spin - polarized gases of hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) could be an ideal candidate for achieving a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) state opened an intense experimental search which finally led to its first observation in rb , na and li in 1995 .",

    "the variational parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath41 ( [ trial],[nosanow ] ) have been obtained at different densities by optimizing the variational energy calculated with the vmc method .",
    "for example , in the gas phase and at a density @xmath42 @xmath43 the values are @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xmath46 ; @xmath35 increases with density whereas @xmath36 remains practically constant . in the solid phase the most relevant parameter is @xmath41 , which increases from a value 0.3 @xmath47 at melting density up to 1.3 @xmath47 at the highest density here studied ;",

    "finally , we have analyzed carefully the size dependence of our simulations .",
    "the calculations on the gas phase have been carried out with 128 atoms and some checks with 150 and 170 atoms have also been made . using standard tail corrections , which assume a uniform system ( @xmath51 ) beyond @xmath52 , with @xmath53 the length of the simulation box , the size dependence of the energy remains smaller than the typical size of the statistical errors .",
    "the size effects are larger in the calculations of the solid phase . in this case , we have used 128 , 108 , and 180 atoms for the bcc , fcc , and hcp lattices . to consider tail corrections in the same form as in the gas phase is a rough approximation due to the periodic order of the solid . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",
    "we have studied the size dependence of the energy at the vmc level where larger number of particles can be used .",
    "from the vmc results one extracts the tail corrections for a given number of atoms and then these are added to the dmc energies .",

    "spin - polarized hydrogen atoms interact via the triplet potential @xmath54 , calculated with high precision by kolos and wolniewicz ( kw ) in 1965 .  @xcite due to the simplicity of the h atom it is possible to calculate this potential in an essentially exact way .",
