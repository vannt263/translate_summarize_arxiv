    "theoretical investigations of the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter suggest the existence of a critical point ( cp ) at finite baryochemical potential and temperature .",
    "this cp is the endpoint of a line of first order transitions associated with the partial restoration of chiral symmetry when the temperature @xmath2 , for given baryochemical potential @xmath3 , increases beyond a critical value @xmath4 ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical analyses using lattice qcd calculations , which are based on first principles , lead to controversial results @xcite on the existence and location of the cp , mainly due to the lack of a generally accepted technique to deal with finite chemical potentials . consequently , this issue needs to be clarified by an experimental exploration of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "such a program is pursued by changing energy and size of colliding nuclei in current ion collision experiments at the sps @xcite and rhic @xcite .",
    "a prerequisite for this scanning program is the determination of suitable observables carrying the information of the cp , as attempted in several recent theoretical studies @xcite . to this end",
    "it is necessary to consider the fluctuations of the chiral condensate @xmath5 which is the order parameter of the transition ( @xmath6 is the quark field ) .",
    "the quantum state which carries the quantum numbers as well as the critical properties of the chiral condensate is the sigma - field @xmath7 . in a heavy - ion collision",
    "the excitation of the vacuum leading to the formation of the chiral condensate is likely to occur .",
    "however , the condensate will be unstable , decaying mainly into pions , at time scales characteristic of the strong interaction",
    ". the critical properties of the condensate are transferred to detectable @xmath1 pairs with invariant mass just above twice the pion mass @xcite . in a finite - density medium",
    "there is a mixing between the chiral condensate and the net - baryon density inducing critical fluctuations in the latter @xcite as well .",
    "furthermore , critical fluctuations of the chiral condensate are also directly transferred to the net - proton density , as well as to the proton and antiproton densities separately , through the coupling of the protons with the isospin zero @xmath8-field  @xcite . thus detecting the qcd cp through fluctuations of the proton density",
    "is a promising strategy .",
    "most searches for the cp studied event - by - event fluctuations of integrated quantities like multiplicity ( variance @xcite , skewness and kurtosis @xcite ) and averaged transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "indications of a maximum of such fluctuations were observed in si+si collisions at 158@xmath0 gev  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on local power - law fluctuations @xcite directly related to the critical behaviour of density - density correlations detectable through the measurement of second scaled factorial moments ( ssfms ) in transverse momentum space within the framework of an intermittency analysis @xcite .",
    "the intermittency approach in this case differs from previous studies  @xcite in analysing quantities directly related to the order parameter of the phase transition such as the sigma condensate @xcite and the net - baryon density @xcite .",
    "the advantage is that for a critical system the fluctuations of these quantities are expected to obey power laws with exponents determined by the corresponding critical exponents  @xcite .    in the present letter",
    "we extend our previous intermittency analysis of low - mass @xmath1 pairs  @xcite to an intermittency study of the proton density in transverse momentum space . using data recorded by the na49 experiment we calculate the corresponding ssfms and look for the presence of power - law fluctuations after suitable subtraction of background .",
    "in transverse momentum intermittency analysis we calculate , for every considered ensemble of protons , the ssfm : @xmath9 as a function of the number @xmath10 of subdivisions in each transverse momentum space direction of a rectangular domain @xmath11 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : facmom ] ) @xmath12 is the number of protons in the cell @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the total number of cells .",
    "the brackets @xmath15 indicate averaging over events , however in the following , in order to simplify the notation , we will use @xmath15 to indicate averaging over both , bins and events . for a pure critical system freezing out exactly at the chiral cp",
    "the ssfm ( eq .  ( [ eq : facmom ] ) ) of protons emitted into a small window around midrapidity is expected to possess a @xmath16 power - law dependence @xmath17 for @xmath18 , with exponent ( intermittency index ) @xmath19 determined by universality class arguments associated with the critical properties of qcd @xcite .",
    "this results from the fact that in this phase space region the density of the critical system is constant in rapidity and the associated fluctuations in transverse momentum and rapidity space factorize , becoming statistically independent .",
    "when moving the position of the window towards beam rapidity , the critical behaviour in transverse momentum is gradually masked @xcite .    in practice",
    "the critical system will never be 100% pure because of uncertainties in the identification of the protons .",
    "in addition , when the freeze out of the state is located at a distance from the cp , the ensemble of protons will be contaminated by a percentage of non - critical protons which will deform @xmath20 leading to a decrease of the value of @xmath21 and/or a modification of the power - law dependence  @xcite .",
    "therefore the power - law behaviour due to the critical protons can be revealed by writing the numerator in [ eq : facmom ] as : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the critical component in the phase space integrated two - particle density , @xmath24 is the background contribution due to the presence of non - critical protons and @xmath25 is a cross - term .",
    "this partitioning of the numerator is based on the assumption that the proton multiplicity in each cell can be divided into background and critical contributions , @xmath26 .",
    "the cross term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit2p ] ) vanishes when @xmath27 or @xmath28 since the corresponding joint probability acquires a @xmath29-function singularity in these limits .",
    "thus , under general conditions we can write the cross - term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit2p ] ) as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a finite quantity . in general the quantity",
    "@xmath31 can not be further determined . dividing both sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit2p ] ) by @xmath32 ( which is proportional to @xmath33 for large @xmath10 ) we obtain the expression : @xmath34 for the correlator @xmath35 containing the critical contribution . in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlator ] ) @xmath36 is the ssfm calculated from the data , @xmath37 is a measure of the contamination by non - critical protons and @xmath38 is the ssfm of the background .",
    "note that for @xmath18 the ratio @xmath39 becomes independent of @xmath10 and can be identified as the fraction of non - critical protons in the considered ensemble . by construction",
    "the correlator @xmath40 possesses the same @xmath14 dependence as the ssfm of the critical component ( @xmath41 ) for @xmath18 since the background contribution to the two - particle correlations is removed .",
    "two special cases of eq .",
    "( [ eq : correlator ] ) merit discussion :    1 .   when background dominates i.e. @xmath42 we neglect the third term in the rhs of eq .  (",
    "[ eq : correlator ] ) which is equivalent to omitting the cross - term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit2p ] ) .",
    "the justification of this approximation is non - trivial and will be provided by model simulations .",
    "these will be discussed in section  [ sect4 ] together with the presentation of the results from the data analysis .",
    "when the freeze - out of the considered system occurs very close to the chiral cp , one expects the background contribution to become very small so that @xmath43 for @xmath18 and the correlator @xmath40 coincides with @xmath36 .    in the first case one can use mixed events generated from the data to simulate the background contribution and estimate @xmath44 in eq .",

    "the event statistics amounted to 210k events for  c\"+c , 176k events for  si\"+si , and 1480k events for pb+pb .",
    "the standard event and track selection cuts of the na49 experiment were applied as described in  ref.@xcite . specifically , to avoid double counting of split tracks we only accepted tracks for which the ratio of number of measured points to estimated maximum number of points in the tpcs exceeds 55% .",
    "proton identification  @xcite used the measurements of particle energy loss @xmath52 in the gas of the time projection chambers .",
    "the inclusive @xmath52 distribution for positively charged particles in each reaction was fitted in 10 bands of momentum @xmath53 to a sum of contributions @xmath54 from different particle species @xmath55 with @xmath55 = @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath53 , @xmath58 .",
    "the probability @xmath59 for a track with energy loss @xmath60 and momentum @xmath61 of being a proton is then given by @xmath62 .",
    "the value of @xmath59 for proton candidates had to exceed 80% for the  c\"+c and  si\"+si systems and 90% for pb+pb .",
    "for the pb+pb system we also analysed 360k events of the 12.5% most central collisions at @xmath63 gev .",
    "gev were insufficient to perform the intermittency analysis . ]",
    "we calculated the ssfms eq .",
    "( [ eq : facmom ] ) of the three considered systems  c\"+c ,  si\"+si and pb+pb in the domain @xmath64 \\otimes [ -p_{y , max},p_{y , max}]$ ] of the transverse momentum plane @xmath65 with @xmath661.5  gev/@xmath67 .",
    "this plane is perpendicular to the beam direction , @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the corresponding horizontal and vertical transverse momentum components . for the calculations we selected protons with center of mass rapidity @xmath70 in order to restrict the analysis to the midrapidity region which is a necessary condition for the appearance of power - law critical fluctuations ( see section  [ sect2 ] ) .",
    "usually in intermittency analysis the only change of the transverse momentum lattice is the decrease of the lattice constant with increasing @xmath10 ( the lattice becomes finer ) , keeping the lattice position in transverse momentum space fixed .",
    "however , the lattice bin boundaries may separate into different bins proton pairs with distances smaller than the bin size leading to unwanted bin to bin fluctuations .",
    "when the multiplicity per event is large these fluctuations are not relevant compared to the bin to bin fluctuations generated by the protons within a single bin . since in our analysis , especially for the light systems (  c \" and  si \" ) , the multiplicity per event is very small this splitting effect due to the boundaries becomes important . to reduce these fluctuations , we calculated the ssfms using slightly displaced transverse momentum lattices and averaged the resulting @xmath20 values over the lattice positions .",
    "the displacement of the lattices was chosen small enough in order to avoid significant changes of the content of the analysed ensemble of protons .",
    "we used 11 differently located lattices changing their position from @xmath71 gev/@xmath67 @xmath72 gev/@xmath67 to @xmath73 gev/@xmath67 @xmath74 gev/@xmath67 .",
    "this procedure was applied to both the analysed data and the mixed events generated from the corresponding data .",
    "having calculated the ssfms of the data @xmath36 and the associated mixed events @xmath75 as described above we subsequently estimated the correlator eq .",

    "( [ eq : correlator ] ) .",
    "we justify these assumptions by simulating and analysing data sets consisting of a mixture of critical protons generated by the critical monte - carlo ( cmc ) code @xcite and randomly distributed protons ( see section  [ sect4 ] ) .",
    "next we searched for critical behaviour of the estimated correlator @xmath78 expecting ( in the presence of critical fluctuations ) the occurrence of an intermittency effect @xmath79 for @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the intermittency index @xmath21 can be determined by a power - law fit ( pf ) to @xmath78 in the region of sufficiently large @xmath14 .",
    "standard error propagation turned out to be impractical for our intermittency analysis .",
    "we therefore obtained estimates of the statistical uncertainties of the ssfms as well as of the @xmath21 values by using the resampling method  @xcite .",
    "this implies constructing new sets of events of the same size ( statistics ) as the original set by randomly sampling , with uniform probability , whole events with replacement from the original data set and calculating ssfms as well as @xmath78 for each resampled set  @xcite . in the new sets ,",
    "some events are of necessity omitted and others duplicated . in the calculation of @xmath78 we used for all samples",
    "the same , very large ( of the order of @xmath81 ) set of mixed events ( one for each considered system ) , in order to reduce the statistical fluctuations of the background and the required computing time .",
    "then we determined through a pf the intermittency index @xmath21 for each sample and obtained the distribution @xmath82 characterizing each analysed system .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : fig1 ] we show @xmath20 versus @xmath14 for the three analysed systems ( black circles ) . in the same figure we also plot the ssfms for the corresponding mixed events ( red crosses ) .",

    "the difference between the two moments increases with increasing number of cells @xmath14 , a typical characteristic of intermittent behaviour .",
    "this observation is an indication for sizeable correlations among the produced protons .",

    "this property suggests that the observed intermittency effect can not be attributed to a non - critical origin such as final state interactions since in this case , being proportional to the proton density , it would increase with increasing rapidity .",
    "we also repeated the analysis for protons with @xmath148 and found @xmath149 .",
    "thus within the errors there is no significant change of @xmath21 by further decreasing the size of the window around midrapidity .",
    "however , the errors increase since the statistics becomes worse .     for the 12.5% most central pb+pb collisions at @xmath145 gev using tracks with ( a ) @xmath150 and",

    "[ fig : fig6]b with fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6]c we clearly observe that the intermittency effect disappears at lower energy .",
    "this result is important for three reasons :    * it supports further the fact that the correlations observed at @xmath89 gev can not be related to final state interactions since in this case they should increase for the lower energy system . *",
    "it is unlikely that the observed intermittency effect could be related to protons originating from decay of resonances since this conventional mechanism is present also in the low energy system . *",
    "it suggests that the critical baryochemical potential is closer to @xmath154 mev , the freeze - out baryochemical potential at @xmath89 gev , than to @xmath155 mev , the value at @xmath156 gev @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as already stated , the statistics is insufficient for a similar analysis in the ",
    "si\"+si system at @xmath156 gev .",
    "in summary , na49 performed a search for critical fluctuations in central c+c , si+si and pb+pb collisions using ssfms of the proton density in transverse momentum space",
    ". our analysis does not only demonstrate the presence of non - poissonian fluctuations in the si+si and pb+pb freeze - out states at @xmath89 gev but it also shows their power - law nature as expected for the emergence of self - similar structured fluctuations characteristic of the approach to the critical point .",
    "the power - law exponent @xmath157 for the  si\"+si system approaches in size the qcd prediction .",
    "our analysis combined with our recent observation @xcite of power - law fluctuations in low - mass @xmath1 pairs at the same collision energy , provides the _ first _ experimental indication for the existence of the cp in the neighbourhood of the si+si and pb+pb freeze - out states ( @xmath158  mev , @xmath159 mev ) in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter .",
    "the absence of power - law correlations for pb+pb at @xmath156 gev ( @xmath155 mev ) disfavours the location of the cp close to the value of @xmath160 predicted by the lattice calculations of ref.@xcite .",
    "future measurements of proton density fluctuations in the na61 experiment studying a+a collisions with small and intermediate size nuclei will further constrain the location of the cp .",
    "significant new results on fluctuations may also be expected from the rhic beam energy scan program @xcite .",
