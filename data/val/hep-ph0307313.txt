    "the standard model ( sm ) has become nowadays the necessary reference to confront experimental data with theory : any possible discrepancy between them is commonly denoted as new physics ( np ) , actually implying the need for some new assumptions or extensions of the basic physical postulates . in the sm ,",
    "matter and gauge fields follow different statistics , the former being fermions and the latter bosons .",
    "as is well - known , there are important reasons to believe that this is quite unsatisfactory .",
    "one of the major motivations to extend the sm is to resolve the hierarchy and fine - tuning questions between the electroweak scale and the planck scale .",
    "supersymmetry is a very nice solution in this regard , since diagrams with superpartners exactly cancel the quadratic divergences of the sm diagrams . in particular",
    ", it requires that the boson sector of the sm including the higgs structure should be enlarged with new scalar fields . until recently , supersymmetry was thought as the only possibility to solve the hierarchy problem , partly because of the lack of known alternatives .",
    "however , a new formulation for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( dubbed @xmath4little higgs ",
    "theories @xcite ) has recently emerged where cancellation of divergences occur , conversely to supersymmetry , between particles with the same statistics .",
    "the ( initially massless ) higgs fields can be seen in this framework as goldstone bosons , adquiring a mass and becoming pseudo - goldstone bosons via explicit symmetry breaking at the electroweak scale , but still protected by an approximate global symmetry which would keep them relatively light .",
    "this is not the whole story , however .",
    "another approach to solve the hierarchy problem aimed to the old idea on kaluza - klein extra dimensions , either in an add scenario @xcite or in a randall - sundrum model @xcite . in both cases",
    ", the scalar sector would be increased by the presence of neutral bosons like scalar gravitons and radions ( the latter associated to the quantum oscillations of the interbrane separation ) , eventually leading to measurable deviations from the sm @xcite .",
    "moreover , let us cite another example of this kind of extensions of the sm : the axion model , originally introduced in @xcite as a consequence of the spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath5 axial symmetry .",
    "nowadays , the axion is a pseudoscalar field appearing in a variety of theories with different meanings including superstring theory , yielding sometimes a massless particle and others a massive one : in astrophysics the axion represents a good candidate of the cold dark matter component of the universe .",
    "although there are well established mass bounds ( e.g. from lep searches @xcite ) for the standard higgs boson and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the situation can be different in more general scenarios where the tight constraints on the parameters of the theory do not apply , leaving still room for light higgs bosons compatible with present data although the point is currently controversial ( see , for example , @xcite ) . as a suggestive example , let us mention that a possible mixing between higgs bosons from a two doublet structure ( which will deserve special attention in this paper ) and resonances would alter the exclusion limits put by lep data on light higgs bosons since the branching fraction ( bf ) into tau pairs decreases considerably in this case @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the so - called next to mssm ( nmssm ) a gauge singlet superfield is added to the mssm spectrum @xcite : new cp - even and cp - odd higgs bosons enter the game . for some choices of the parameters of this model",
    ", one can obtain very light pseudoscalar higgs states evading the lep constraints and whose detection might require some dedicated efforts at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the search for axions or light higgs bosons in the decays of heavy resonances has several attractive features : first , the couplings of the former to fermions are proportional to their masses and therefore enhanced with respect to lighter mesons .",
    "second , theoretical calculations are more reliable , notably with the advent of non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , intensive searches for a light higgs - like boson ( to be generically denoted by @xmath6 in this paper ) have been performed according to the so - called wilczek mechanism @xcite in the radiative decay of vector heavy quarkonia like the upsilon resonance ( i.e. @xmath7 ) . to date , none of all these searches has been successful , but have provided valuable constraints on the mass values of light higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we develop the key ideas already presented in @xcite on a possible signal of np based on the @xmath4apparent  breaking of lepton universality in bottomonium decays .",
    "_ stricto sensu _",
    ", lepton universality implies that the electroweak couplings to gauge fields of all charged lepton species should be the same ; according to our interpretation , the ( would - be ) dependence on the leptonic mass of the leptonic branching fractions ( @xmath8 ; @xmath9 ) of @xmath3 resonances below the @xmath0 threshold , if experimentally confirmed by forthcoming measurements , might be viewed as a hint of the existence of a quite light higgs - of mass about 10 gev - deserving a closer look .      in its minimal version ,",
    "the sm requires a complex scalar weak - isospin doublet to spontaneously break the electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "as already commented , theories that try to resolve the hierarchy and fine - tuning problems imply the extension of the higgs sector . loosely speaking , the simplest way ( i.e. adding the fewest number of arbitrary parameters ) corresponds to assume an extra higgs doublet , i.e. the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) @xcite .",
    "the higgs content of this theory is the following : a charged pair ( @xmath10 ) , two neutral cp - even scalars ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and a neutral cp - odd scalar ( @xmath13 ) often referred as a pseudoscalar .",
    "let us also note that diverse extended frameworks beyond the sm can lead to an effective theory at low energies equivalent to the 2hdm .",
    "on the other hand , there exist models with higher representations for the higgs sector ( e.g. higgs triplets or the above - mentioned nmssm ) leading to more complicated structures @xcite .",
    "any two - doublet higgs model has to cope with the potential problem of enhancing the flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) .",
    "several solutions have been proposed to overcome this serious difficulty . in the type",
    "- i 2hdm only one of the higgs doublets couple to quarks and leptons and , since the process which diagonalizes the mass matrix of quarks equally can diagonalize the higgs coupling , there is no flavor - changing vertex for the higgs bosons at the end .",
    "( note that in such case the higgs coupling to @xmath14 quarks is not enhanced . )",
    "another extreme possibility to avoid fcnc s is based on the assumption that one higgs doublet does not couple to fermions at all whereas the other higgs couples to fermions in the same way as in the minimal higgs model . on the other hand ,",
    "the type - ii 2hdm allows one of the higgs doublet couple to the up quarks and leptons while the other higgs doublet can couple to down - type quarks and leptons .",
    "this is the kind of model on which we shall focus in the following , excluding mssm since current limits rule out a very light pseudoscalar higgs boson @xcite as advocated along this work .",
    "nevertheless , other alternative scenarios as those mentioned in the introduction can not be discarded .    among other new parameters of the 2hdm ,",
    "one of special phenomenological significance in this work is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( @xmath15 of the higgs down- and up - doublets respectively ) usually denoted as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 with @xmath18 gev fixed by the @xmath19 mass .",
    "indeed , @xmath20 governs the yukawa couplings between higgs bosons and fermions , thereby potentially enhancing the rate of processes forbidden by the sm , but allowed thanks to new contributions heralding the existence of np .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following : in section 2 we tentatively introduce the hypothesis of a light non - standard higgs boson which could modify the leptonic decay rate of @xmath3 resonances ; in section 3 we firstly apply time ordered second - order perturbation theory for a two - step process : prior photon radiation from the upsilon leading to a pseudoscalar intermediate state followed by its annihilation into a lepton pair mediated by a cp - odd higgs . alternatively",
    ", we consider in subsection 3.2 the factorization of the decay width assuming the existence of fock states in hadrons containing ( ultra)soft photons as low - energy degrees of freedom in analogy to gluons in nrqcd . in sections 4 and 5 ,",
    "we focus on a 2hdm(ii ) model and the effects of the postulated np contribution on the leptonic branching fraction are analyzed in the light of current experimental data : we conclude from a statistical test that lepton universality can be rejected at a 10@xmath21 level of significance .",
    "possible mixing between a pseudoscalar higgs and @xmath22 resonances is also considered , and its consequences on the hyperfine splitting between vector and pseudoscalar states .",
    "we finally gather technical details in three appendices at the end of the paper .",
    "the starting point of our considerations is the well - known van royen - weisskopf formula @xcite including the color factor for the leptonic width of a vector quarkonium state without neglecting leptonic masses , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electromagnetic fine structure constant ; @xmath25 denotes the mass of the vector particle ( a @xmath26 resonance in this particular case ) and @xmath27 is the charge of the relevant ( bottom ) quark ( @xmath28 in units of @xmath29 ) ; @xmath30 stands for the non - relativistic radial wave function of the @xmath31 bound state at the origin ; finally , the @xmath4kinematic  factor @xmath32 reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "leptonic masses are usually neglected in eq.(1 ) ( by setting @xmath32 equal to unity ) except for the decay into @xmath35 pairs .",
    "let us note that @xmath36 is a decreasing function of @xmath37 : the higher leptonic mass the smaller decay rate .",
    "such @xmath37-dependence is quite weak for bottomonium and , consequently , we will assume that lepton universality implies the constancy of the width ( 1 ) for all lepton species .",
    "however , in this work we are conjecturing the existence of a light higgs - like particle whose mass would be close to the @xmath3 mass and which could show up in the cascade decay : @xmath38 actually , this process may be seen as a continuum radiative transition that in principle permits the coupling of the bottom quark - antiquark pair to a particle of variable mass and @xmath39 : @xmath40 ( always positive charge conjugation ) . in this investigation",
    "we will confine our attention to the two first possibilities : a scalar or a pseudoscalar boson .",
    "in fact , intermediate bound states and not the continuum will play a leading role in the process , as we shall see . in the language of perturbation theory , a magnetic dipole transition ( m1 ) would yield at leading order a pseudoscalar @xmath1 state from the initial - state vector resonance , subsequently annihilating into a dilepton .",
    "alternatively , there should be a certain probability that a pseudoscalar color - singlet @xmath1 system could exist in the fock decomposition of the physical upsilon state , as the light degrees of freedom would carry the remaining quantum numbers .    throughout this work",
    ", we will focus on vector @xmath3 states of the bottomonium family below open flavor , state is excluded in the present analysis since only experimental data for the muonic channel @xcite are currently available ; see http://pdg.lbl.gov for regular updates . ] and the complete process ( 3 ) actually would be @xmath41(\\rightarrow \\phi^0\\rightarrow \\ell^+\\ell^-)\\,\\,\\ ; \\,\\,\\",
    "\\ell = e,\\mu,\\tau \\label{eq : channel}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 denotes a _ soft _ (= unobserved ) photon and @xmath43 $ ] stands for those intermediate states of different quantum numbers collectively denoted by @xmath44 , either on the continuum or as bound states .",
    "note that @xmath6 is not a real particle in the channel ( [ eq : channel ] ) , conversely to the wilczek mechanism @xcite , but a virtual state mediating the annihilation of a @xmath1 intermediate state into the final - state lepton pair .",
    "hence , if the @xmath6 mass were quite close to the @xmath3 mass , the higgs propagator could enhance significantly the width of whole process .",
    "in fact , the analysis performed by opal @xcite using lep data assuming a mixing between higgs bosons and bottomonium resonances @xcite does not permit to exclude a light higgs of mass around 10 gev using reasonable @xmath20 values in the 2hdm(ii ) .",
    "moreover , one should not dismiss other possible scenarios , as pointed out in the introduction .    since the radiated photon would escape detection in our guess , include soft radiated photons which , however , have to be taken into account for a consistent definition of the leptonic widths @xcite , as we claim for the np contribution advocated in this work . ] the np channel ( [ eq : channel ] ) would be unwittingly ascribed to the leptonic decay mode of the upsilon resonance , introducing in its @xmath8 a quadratic leptonic mass dependence opposite to that of eq.(2 ) due to the higgs coupling to fermions this is a cornerstone in our conjecture but likely of practical significance only for the @xmath35 decay mode , where missing energy is experimentally required as one of the selection criteria@xcite : events with photons of order 100 mev would be included in the sample of tauonic decays , ultimately contributing to the measured leptonic bf . on the contrary , the electronic and muonic bf s would be affected to a much lesser extent , both because of : i ) the smaller leptonic mass ; ii ) the experimental constraint on the reconstructed dilepton invariant mass , which restricts severely the energy of possible @xmath4lost  photons .. hence @xmath45 is much more limited by invariant mass reconstruction of either electrons or muons than for tau s where such constraint is not applicable .",
    "i especially acknowledge n. horwitz and the cleo collaboration for correspondence in this regard . ]",
    "along this section , we examine the role played by intermediate states in the process ( 4 ) according to two different schemes : firstly , we use time - ordered perturbation theory ( topt ) to deal with the formation , via an electromagnetic transition from the initial - state @xmath3 , of a virtual @xmath1 state and its subsequent annihilation into a lepton pair . as an alternative approach , we rely on the separation between long- and short - distance physics following the main lines of a non - relativistic effective theory ( nret ) like nrqcd @xcite - albeit replacing a gluon by a photon in the usual fock decomposition of hadronic bound states - and nrqed @xcite .",
    "different results for the final widths in each approach come up , however ; they are discussed in subsection 3.3 . finally , let us note that , despite we generically refer to the upsilon ( @xmath3 ) in our study , actually we are focusing on the @xmath46 state because of more precise data on its tauonic bf ( @xmath47 ) w.r.t .",
    "the @xmath48 , and not yet available for the @xmath49 .",
    "let us write the amplitude for the process ( [ eq : channel ] ) using topt at lowest order : @xmath50 the sum extends over all possible @xmath1 intermediate states with proper quantum numbers and energy @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the energy of the unobserved photon .",
    "bottomonium states in a @xmath53 configuration should dominate the sum , as we are facing the radiative decay of a @xmath3 resonance .",
    "intermediary states of higher angular momentum will be suppressed , since the associated electromagnetic transitions would involve higher multipole moments ; m1 transitions to @xmath54-wave states with different principal quantum numbers will neither be considered , as they involve orthogonal wave functions in the non - relativistic limit .    from expression ( [ eq : topt ] )",
    "we also see that intermediate states with energies closer to the @xmath3 mass are enhanced with respect to those of higher virtuality . in that sense ,",
    "the continuum @xmath1 contribution , starting with a pair of @xmath0 mesons ( @xmath55 gev ) , is well above the @xmath46 and @xmath48 masses , and the main contributions to the decay would come from intermediate pseudoscalar @xmath54-wave bound states , i.e. the @xmath22 resonances , differing from the @xmath3 resonances in virtue of the hyperfine structure .",
    "squaring the amplitude ( [ eq : topt ] ) and including phase space integrations , the width of the process reads @xmath56 & & \\times\\int de_{\\ell\\ell}\\,\\ , \\rho_{\\ell^+\\ell^- } \\,|\\langle \\ , \\ell^+\\ell^- | \\,{\\mbox h}\\ , | \\,\\eta_b \\,\\rangle |^2\\ , 2\\pi\\,\\delta(m_{\\upsilon}-k - e_{\\ell\\ell})+\\dots \\label{eq : width1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the dots stand for other intermediate states contributing to the sum in ( [ eq : topt ] ) . for explicit expressions of the particle densities @xmath57 , @xmath58 , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "the last integral amounts to the width of a @xmath59 resonance with mass @xmath60 decaying into a pair of leptons , which we will denote as @xmath61 .",
    "section [ sec : higgs ] will be devoted to the calculation of this annihilation via the proposed higgs exchange .",
    "the matrix element squared for the m1 transition between spin - triplet and spin - singlet @xmath54-wave states of quarkonium can be written in terms of the @xmath62 width after performing the integration over allowed photon states with energy @xmath52 , @xmath63 where we emphasize the off - shellness of pseudoscalar resonance by writing @xmath64 . in the last step ,",
    "we used a non - relativistic approximation to estimate the width @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "we shall return later to this formula in greater detail . plugging the above result into eq.(6 )",
    "one obtains @xmath66 under the _ soft _ photon hypothesis , we have restricted the integration over photon energies to an upper limit @xmath67 , dictated by both experimental photon energy resolution and event selection criteria as pointed out in section 2 . in that case",
    "we can safely retain the first term in the expansion of the @xmath22 energy , @xmath68 in the denominator of ( [ eq : width2 ] ) : @xmath69 the instability of the @xmath22 intermediate state has been taken into account by the substitution @xmath70 , valid in the narrow - width case .",
    "a rough estimate of this width can be obtained through the pqcd relation @xcite @xmath71 ^ 5\\ ] ] with reasonable values of the quark masses , the running strong coupling and the measured @xmath72mev @xcite , we get @xmath73mev .",
    "consider now the quantity between curly braces in eq.([eq : width3 ] ) : @xmath74 the mass difference @xmath75 is the hyperfine splitting between the @xmath76 partners .",
    "different approaches suggest that @xmath77 lies in the interval @xmath78 mev for @xmath79 ( see @xcite for a compilation of theoretical results ) .",
    "if @xmath80 , i.e. the range of energies for the unobserved photon is higher that the mass difference @xmath77 , the integration region in eq.([eq : pm1 ] ) comprises the full @xmath22 resonance contribution ; taking @xmath81 would reduce the result by a half , and values of @xmath82 below @xmath83 would make @xmath84 almost vanishing . finally , a very large value of @xmath82 would make ( 10 ) quadratically divergent ( and then @xmath82 can be seen as an ultraviolet regulator ) .",
    "now , keeping track of our discussion at the end of section 2 , those events with photons of energies up to several hundred mev would pass the selection criteria employed in experiments measuring the tauonic bf of @xmath3 resonances .",
    "therefore , one can safely take in this case ( @xmath85 ) the upper limit @xmath82 in the integrals of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : width2]-[eq : pm1 ] ) of the order of few hundreds of mev , well above the quantity @xmath86 , but always @xmath87 .",
    "we thus evaluate the integral in eq.([eq : pm1 ] ) and take the limit of small @xmath88 , yielding @xmath89 the off - shell width @xmath61 has been transformed in this limit to the on - shell width @xmath90 , as @xmath91 . in section 4",
    "we will obtain an expression for this partial width dominated by the postulated higgs boson .",
    "finally , under the aforementioned assumption that the photon energy cutoff @xmath82 is large enough , the partial width of the whole decay reduces to the factorized formula @xmath92 where @xmath93 is now the on - shell m1 transition between real @xmath94 and @xmath95 states ( i.e. @xmath96 ) . dividing both sides of eq.([eq : finalwidth ] ) by the upsilon total width @xmath97 , one gets the final bf as the product of two bf s , namely @xmath98 .",
    "we have thus proved that our approximation for the full process matches the corresponding expression to a cascade decay taking place through a @xmath64 intermediate state above threshold .",
    "remarkably , no dependence on the @xmath82 parameter is left , provided that the condition @xmath99 is satisfied .    as argued before , other possible intermediate contributions ( i.e. @xmath0 continuum )",
    "are numerically less relevant due to their increasing mass difference ( @xmath100 ) in the denominator of eq.([eq : topt ] ) ; in fact , one can check that the interference between @xmath22 and continuum contributions in eq.([eq : width1 ] ) , assuming that the matrix elements @xmath101 , @xmath102 have the same @xmath52-dependence , gives a correction which is well below 1% for both the @xmath46 and @xmath48 resonances using @xmath103 mev and @xmath104 mev as reference values .",
    "pure continuum contributions would be even more suppressed .      instead of supposing a final - state photon radiated by the upsilon via a m1 transition as in the precedent section",
    ", we will now consider the soft @xmath42 incorporated as a dynamical photon into a fock state of the resonance , in analogy to soft gluons in the framework of nrqcd .",
    "admittedly , the strong interaction rules the hadronic dynamics but electromagnetism still has small but observable consequences , e.g. isospin breaking effects @xcite .    in a naive quark model ,",
    "quarkonium is treated as a nonrelativistic bound state of a quark - antiquark pair in a static color field which sets up an instantaneous confining potential .",
    "although this picture has been remarkably successful in accounting for the properties and phenomenology of heavy quarkonia , it overlooks gluons whose wavelengths are larger that the bound state size : dynamical gluons permit a meaningful fock decomposition ( in the coulomb gauge ) of physical states beyond the leading non - relativistic description with important consequences both in decays and production of heavy quarkonium",
    ".    in particular , the @xmath1 system in a @xmath3 vector resonance can exist in a configuration other than the dominant @xmath105 since the light degrees of freedom mainly formed by gluons and light quark - antiquark pairs can carry the remaining quantum numbers , albeit with a smaller probability .",
    "moreover , it is arguable that soft photons should be included among those low - energy hadronic modes too , therefore allowing the heavy quark - antiquark system to be , for example , in a color - singlet , spin - singlet configuration , i.e. a @xmath106+\\gamma_s\\rangle$ ] state.$ ] state will be denoted as @xmath64 .",
    "] hence , such dynamical photons would participate in some decay modes of heavy quarkonium , in analogy to dynamical gluons .    according to nrqcd , higher fock states containing soft gluons",
    "indeed can participate actively in the decays of heavy quarkonium , as for example , its annihilation into light hadrons @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "the probabilities of possible fock components are encoded in long - distance matrix elements ; the heavy quark - antiquark annihilation itself , being a short - distance process , would be perturbatively calculable .",
    "on the other hand , details about the complicated nonperturbative hadronization of gluons into final - state light hadrons can be avoided in inclusive channels by assuming the hadronization probability equal to one .",
    "likewise , one can consider fock states containing dynamical photons ,",
    "i.e. pertaining to the hadron during a long - time scale as compared with the short - time process represented in our case by the @xmath1 annihilation into a dilepton , of order @xmath107 .",
    "thus , a dynamical ( quasi - real ) photon , stemming from a @xmath106+\\gamma_s\\rangle$ ] fock state , could end up ( without need of hadronization ) as a final - state photon - though undetected as postulated in this work . obviously",
    ", important differences stand between dynamical gluons and photons so that it will be instructive to review several aspects of nrqcd relevant for our later development .",
    "nrqcd is a low - energy effective theory for the strong interaction removing the unwanted degrees of freedom associated to the heavy quark mass .",
    "the following hierarchy between hadronic scales is usually assumed in heavy quarkonium : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 denotes the mass and relative velocity of the heavy quark to denote the relative three - velocity instead of @xmath111 , usual in nrqcd , to avoid confusion with the vacuum expectation value of the standard higgs boson .",
    "] respectively , and @xmath112 is the strong interaction scale . the bound state dynamics is chiefly dominated by the exchange of coulombic gluons with four - momentum @xmath113 ; soft gluons have four - momenta of order @xmath114 and ultrasoft gluons of order @xmath115 .",
    "likely the above hierarchy makes sense for bottomonium since @xmath116 ; then the energy of ultrasoft degrees of freedom turns out to be of order @xmath117 mev or less .",
    "in fact , the separation between energy scales is decisive in phenomenological applications of nrqcd .",
    "bodwin , braaten and lepage @xcite showed in a rigorous way that inclusive annihilation decays of heavy quarkonium can be factorized according to soft and hard processes : a ) long - distance physics is encoded in matrix elements , providing the probability for finding the heavy quark and antiquark in a certain configuration within the meson which is suitable for annihilation in each particular case ; b ) the short - distance annihilation of the @xmath118 pair with given quantum numbers ( color , spin , angular momentum and total angular momentum ) which could be perturbatively calculated .",
    "therefore , the decay width is written as @xmath119}(\\lambda)\\   \\langle h|{\\cal o}_n^h(\\lambda)|h \\rangle \\label{eq : factor}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is an ultraviolet cutoff of the effective theory , separating the high- and low - energy scales . the short - distance coefficient @xmath120}(\\lambda)$ ] can be calculated as a perturbation series in @xmath121 .",
    "the long - distance parameter @xmath122 determines the probability for the quarkonium to be in the @xmath123$]-configuration of the fock decomposition and can be interpreted as an overlap between the @xmath124 $ ] state and the final hadronic state , requiring either a nonperturbative calculation ( e.g. on the lattice ) or the extraction from experimental data . similar arguments apply to heavy quarkonium inclusive production ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    in close analogy to the above procedure ,",
    "let us also introduce an energy parameter @xmath82 to separate short- from long - distance physics in the process under study in this work as shown in fig.1 .",
    "( one might identify numerically this @xmath82 parameter with the upper limit of the integrals ( 8 - 10 ) in the precedent section . )",
    "thus , a factorization of the decay width of the @xmath3 into two pieces is applied : a ) the probability @xmath125 of the existence within the upsilon of a @xmath106+\\gamma_s\\rangle$ ] fock state ; b ) the annihilation width @xmath126 into a lepton pair via higgs boson exchange .",
    "therefore , @xmath127 can be written in this approach as the product @xmath128 this equation follows the spirit of the factorization given in eq.([eq : factor ] )",
    ". one important difference , however , is that the long - distance quantity @xmath125 can be calculated perturbatively in qed using a quark potential model ( for the initial and final state wave functions are involved ) because of the smallness of the electromagnetic coupling @xmath129 , in contrast to nrqcd matrix elements . on the other hand , the short - distance parameter @xmath126 in eq.(13 ) which we may identify with a particular @xmath120}$ ] coefficient in formula ( 12 ) , can be calculated with the aid of the feynman rules of the model under consideration , as we shall later see .      in nrqcd the probabilities for different fock configurations of the heavy quark - antiquark pair in heavy quarkonium",
    "can be estimated according to the number and order of the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic transitions induced by the interaction effective lagrangian , needed to reach such states from the lowest configuration or viceversa .",
    "let us point out that in our particular case we are considering a mixed situation where _ electromagnetic _ transitions occur between bound states of quarks which are mainly governed by the strong interaction dynamics .",
    "moreover , another caveat is in order : we will compute the transition rate between on - shell states , whereas the pseudoscalar @xmath64 state in ( 13 ) should be somewhat off - shell .",
    "nevertheless , we will assume this off - shellness small on account of the low energy of the radiated photon .",
    "as commented at the beginning of section 3 , we are focusing on the @xmath46 resonance , mainly because of much more precise experimental data on its tauonic bf as compared to the @xmath48 , as displayed in table 1 , and still missing for the @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , the larger number of possible intermediate pseudoscalar bound states for the two latter resonances would make more complicated the theoretical analysis as compared with the @xmath46 state , where only the lowest @xmath130 $ ] fock configuration ( i.e. a single @xmath131 state ) should contribute to the final annihilation into a dilepton . therefore , a textbook expression @xcite has been employed to calculate the width corresponding to a transition between s - wave states , i.e. a direct m1-transition between the @xmath46 and the @xmath131 resonances .",
    "the probability of the fock state @xmath132 @xmath4inside  a @xmath46 resonance is then estimated as the ratio , @xmath133 using @xmath134 gev , and the hyperfine mass splitting between the @xmath3 and @xmath22 states @xmath135 mev as a reference value .",
    "the matrix element @xmath136 is defined as @xmath137 where @xmath138 represents the reduced radial wave function of the initial and final resonance respectively , and @xmath139 is the spherical bessel function .",
    "we have made in ( [ eq : probability ] ) the reasonable approximation : @xmath140 .",
    "let us remark , however , that this parameter involves the wave functions of the @xmath3 and @xmath22 resonances , actually constituting a nonperturbative matrix element appearing in the long - distance part of the factorized width , in analogy to conventional nrqcd .    in the absence of current experimental data ,",
    "it is worth noting that the order - of - magnitude @xmath141 of ( [ eq : probability ] ) agrees with more elaborated calculations .",
    "for example , lhde @xcite obtains for the partial width of the process @xmath142 the value 7.7 ev for @xmath143 mev , which corresponds to a bf of @xmath144 in accordance with ( 14 ) .",
    "let us now compare the partial widths of the @xmath46 decays into three gluons and two gluons plus a photon by means of the ratio @xcite , @xmath145 at the energy scale @xmath146 .",
    "actually , @xmath147 can be crudely viewed as the relative probability ( or suppression factor ) of a @xmath106+\\gamma_s\\rangle$ ] fock state w.r.t .",
    "the corresponding @xmath148+g\\rangle$ ] fock state in the @xmath3 resonance . on the other hand , when the gluon energy is of order @xmath149 or less , the probability for the latter colored fock state scales as @xmath150 according to the nrqcd scaling - velocity rules @xcite . thus ,",
    "numerically @xmath151 , since @xmath116 for bottomonium , showing the same order - of - magnitude as eq.([eq : probability ] ) .",
    "hence , we will assume that eq.(14 ) provides a reasonable estimate of the probability for the existence of a @xmath64 state within the upsilon+3g\\rangle$ ] fock state yielding an unobserved hadronic system in the final state ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "however , this contribution would be very much suppressed because of the large virtuality of the intermediate @xmath64 state since certainly @xmath77 should be quite smaller than the hadronic invariant mass . ] as a function of @xmath77 .    combining the @xmath4master  formula ( 13 ) and equation ( 14 )",
    ", the nret approach leads to @xmath153 for the final decay width , to be compared with eq.([eq : finalwidth ] ) obtained from topt .      from eqs.([eq : finalwidth ] ) and ( [ eq : finalwidth2 ] ) it becomes apparent that the calculations of the final width @xmath127 based upon topt or upon factorization _  la _ nret lead to different results .",
    "indeed , the total width @xmath88 of the @xmath22 resonance appears in the denominator of formula ( [ eq : finalwidth ] ) after the approximations ; instead , the total width @xmath97 of the @xmath3 resonance appears in formula ( [ eq : finalwidth2 ] ) .",
    "since one expects @xmath154 , pair into two gluons should proceed at a higher rate than the corresponding decay channel of the vector resonance via three gluons . ]",
    "the decay rate for the whole channel @xmath155 stemming from the nret factorization turns out to be much larger than the decay rate obtained from topt . in other words ,",
    "both approaches are not dual each other .    actually , the fact that one gets different expressions and hence dissimilar numerical values for the width @xmath127 in both methods is not contradictory in itself for they are based on distinct physical assumptions .",
    "the time - ordered perturbative scheme with @xmath64 production above threshold essentially implies a cascade decay , i.e. photon emission and subsequent annihilation of the intermediate hadronic state . only under this hypothesis and the narrow width approximation , the factorization given by eq.([eq : finalwidth ] )",
    "is justified . on the other hand ,",
    "the factorization _  la _ nret postulated in eq.([eq : finalwidth2 ] ) assumes that a pseudoscalar color - singlet @xmath1 state exists inside the @xmath3 as a fock state .",
    "both starting points are different and the results stemming from each framework need not coincide . ) amounts to the product of branching fractions in a cascade decay ; conversely formula ( [ eq : finalwidth2 ] ) corresponds to the coexistence of a radioactive nuclide in some proportion with a stable isotope in nature .",
    "the decay rate of a sample of this element would be given by the fraction of the radioactive isotope ( i.e. the probability to find a radioactive atom in the sample , analogous to @xmath125 ) multiplied by its decay rate . ]    in fact , equivalent situations can be found , e.g. in inclusive hadroproduction of heavy quarkonium at large transverse momentum @xcite , when comparing the color - singlet fragmentation mechanism ( where all three perturbative final - state gluons are attached to the hard interaction feynman diagram ) versus the color - octet mechanism ( where the emission of two soft gluons from a nonperturbative colored state takes place on a long - time scale ) .",
    "another example where higher fock states can compete with perturbative calculations is the explanation given by braaten and chen of the long - standing @xmath156 puzzle of @xmath157 and @xmath158 decays @xcite . in general , their decays into light hadrons should occur by the annihilation of the @xmath159 pair into three gluons but the discrepancy with experiment is about two orders of magnitude in this channel . instead , they argue that the process is dominated by the higher color - octet contribution @xmath160 $ ] , thereby annihilating into a light quark pair via @xmath161 . the suppression of this decay mode for the @xmath158 is attributed to a dynamical effect which cancels the @xmath159 wavefunction at the origin .",
    "( alternatively , brodsky and karliner @xcite suggested that the decay into @xmath162 should proceed through the intrinsic charm components of the light mesons . )    hereafter , we will adopt the nret factorization as given by the master equation ( [ eq : factorization ] ) and the numerical estimates will be based on eq.([eq : finalwidth2 ] ) .",
    "the low - energy regime of the ( ultra)soft photons provides confidence in this approach . ) instead of eq.([eq : finalwidth2 ] ) large values of @xmath20 are required at the end of the calculation to account for the leptonic bf rise with the lepton mass , leading to a @xmath22 width exceendingly large in contradiction with the narrow width approximation made along the way to get ( [ eq : finalwidth ] ) . on the contrary , no inconsistencies of that kind arise when using the nret approach to interpret the conjecture made in this work . ]",
    "following a general scheme , fermions are supposed to couple to the @xmath6 higgs field according to a yukawa interaction term in the effective lagrangian , @xmath163 where @xmath164 denotes a factor depending on the type of the higgs boson and the specific theory under consideration , which could enhance the coupling with a fermion ( quark or lepton ) of type @xmath4@xmath165  and therefore plays a crucial role in our conjecture .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 couples to the final - state leptons proportionally to their masses , ultimately required because of spin - flip in the interaction of a fermion with a ( pseudo)scalar , thereby providing an experimental signature for checking the existence of a light higgs in our study .",
    "lastly , note that the @xmath166 matrix stands only in the case of a pseudoscalar @xmath6 field .    in this paper",
    "we are tentatively assuming that the mass of the light higgs sought stands close to the @xmath3 resonances below @xmath0 production : @xmath167 .",
    "as will be argued from current experimental data in the next section , we suppose specifically that @xmath168 lies somewhere between the @xmath46 and @xmath48 masses , i.e. @xmath169    now , we define the mass difference : @xmath170 , where @xmath22 denotes either a @xmath171 or a @xmath172 state . accepting for simplicity that the higgs boson stands halfway between the mass values of both resonances",
    ", we set @xmath173 gev for an order - of - magnitude calculation .",
    "hence we write approximately for the scalar tree - level propagator of the @xmath6 particle in the process ( [ eq : channel ] ) entering in the evaluation of @xmath174 , @xmath175 where the total width of the higgs boson @xmath176 has been neglected assuming that @xmath177 .",
    "we will make a consistency check of this point in subsection 5.1 using numerical values .    performing a comparison between the widths of both leptonic decay processes ( i.e. @xmath178 versus @xmath179 )",
    ", one concludes with the aid of eqs.([eq : a0coupling]-[eq : a0prop ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma0 ] ) that @xmath180    above we used the non - relativistic approximation ( more precisely the static approximation ) when assuming null relative momentum of heavy quarks inside quarkonium , and the same wave function at the origin for both the @xmath3 vector state and the @xmath130 $ ] intermediate bound state on account of heavy - quark spin symmetry @xcite .",
    "then , the decay amplitude squared of the pseudoscalar state into a @xmath181 ( cp - even ) higgs vanishes and only a @xmath59 ( cp - odd ) higgs would couple to pseudoscalar quarkonium in this limit .",
    "therefore , the higgs boson hunted in this way should be properly denoted by @xmath13 and , consequently , this notation instead of the generic @xmath6 will be employed for it from now on .",
    "the bf for channel ( [ eq : channel ] ) can be readily obtained inserting eq.([eq : comparison ] ) into eq.([eq : finalwidth2 ] ) and afterwards dividing by @xmath97 , as @xmath182   \\times { \\cal b}_{\\ell\\ell}\\ ] ] so one can compare the relative rates by means of the following ratio @xmath183   \\times \\frac{m_{\\ell}^2}{{\\delta}m^2}\\ ] ] where we are assuming in the denominator that the main contribution to the leptonic channel comes from the photon - exchange graph of fig.1(a ) .",
    "let us point out once again that , since the @xmath42 remains undetected , the np contribution would be experimentally ascribed to the leptonic channel of the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "thus , the ratio ( 22 ) represents the fraction of leptonic decays mediated by a cp - odd higgs , ultimately responsible for the breaking of leptonic universality due to the quadratic mass term @xmath184 .",
    "now , to facilitate the comparison of our results with other searches for higgs bosons , we identify in the following the @xmath185 factor with the 2hdm ( type ii ) parameter for the universal down - type fermion coupling to a cp - odd higgs , i.e. @xmath186 @xcite . inserting numerical values into ( 22 ) and keeping the leading term in @xmath184 ,",
    "one gets the interval @xmath187 where use was made of the approximation @xmath188 gev , and the broad range @xmath189 mev for the possible hyperfine mass diference @xmath77 @xcite ; @xmath190 is expressed in gev .",

    "the mixing between higgs and resonances is described by the introduction of off - diagonal elements denoted by @xmath192 in the mass matrix . in our case , @xmath193 where the subindex @xmath1940 indicates unmixed states .",
    "the off - diagonal element @xmath192 can be computed within the framework of a nonrelativistic quark potential model . for the pseudoscalar case under study ,",
    "one can write @xcite @xmath195 notice that @xmath192 is proportional to @xmath196 , i.e. @xmath20 in the 2hdm(ii ) ; high values of the latter implies that mixing effects can be important over a large mass region . substituting numerical values ( for the radial wave function at the origin we used the potential model estimate from @xcite @xmath197 6.5 gev@xmath198 ) one finds ( in gev@xmath199 units )",

    "the masses and decay widths of the mixed ( physical ) states are thus @xmath206 where subscripts @xmath207 refer to a higgs - like state and a resonance state respectively , if @xmath208 ; the converse if @xmath209 .",
    "in this appendix we consider within the sm an alternative possibility to the higgs conjecture of a rising leptonic bf of bottomonium with the leptonic mass , based on the electromagnetic decay into a lepton pair of the @xmath22 state subsequent to the magnetic dipole transition advocated in this work ( see fig.2 ) .",
