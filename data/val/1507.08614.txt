    "it is by now firmly established by oscillation experiments that neutrinos do have a mass .",
    "however , oscillation experiments are only sensitive to neutrino mass differences and mixing angles , and thus do not provide information on the absolute scale of masses , on the mass hierarchy nor on their dirac or majorana nature .",
    "the nature of neutrino masses and their smallness with respect to those of the charged leptons represents a puzzling fact , possibly related to the mechanism of neutrino mass generation .",
    "three main avenues are currently being pursued in order to experimentally probe the absolute scale of neutrino masses , namely i ) direct measurements , studying the kinematics of @xmath0 decay @xcite , ii ) searches for neutrinoless double @xmath0 decay ( @xmath1 ) @xcite , and iii ) cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "approaches based on kinematic arguments have the advantage of being very direct and model - independent .",
    "an alternative is to study @xmath1 decay , _ i.e. _ , the double @xmath0 decay of nuclei , in which no neutrinos are present in the final state .",
    "if observed , it would guarantee that neutrinos have a non - vanishing majorana mass @xcite ; if not , upper limits on the mass scale can still be placed , under the assumption that neutrinos are majorana particles .",
    "relating the ( potentially ) observed rate for this process to neutrino masses also requires to assume that the mass mechanism is the dominant one leading to @xmath1 decay .",
    "it is worth noting that even if this is the most natural scenario , nevertheless other possibilities exist , involving additional physics beyond the standard model , see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite for a discussion . moreover , our imprecise knowledge of the appropriate nuclear matrix elements is a relevant source of uncertainty on the interpretation of the results of these experiments @xcite .",
    "finally , neutrino masses can be measured through cosmological observations , like measurements of the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background , or of the distribution of large scale structures , since massive neutrinos affect the background evolution of the universe , as well as the growth of cosmological perturbations .",
    "cosmology presently provides the most stringent limits on the absolute scale of neutrino masses @xcite , with the shortcoming that these limits depend on assumptions on the underlying cosmological model .",
    "the three approaches outlined above should be seen as complementary , as each of them presents its own advantages and disadvantages , and also because they probe slightly different quantities related to the neutrino masses .",
    "for this reason , it appears natural to combine data from direct measurements , @xmath1 searches and cosmology , other than from oscillation experiments , in order to constrain the neutrino mass parameters @xcite . in this paper , we want to derive joint constraints on neutrino mass parameters from the most recent observations from both laboratory and cosmological experiments , combining them in the framework of bayesian statistics .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1 experiments , we take into account the uncertainty related to nuclear matrix elements , by treating it as a nuisance parameter to be marginalized over , in order to account its impact on the neutrino mass estimates . we also perform forecasts , considering both forthcoming and next - generation experiments .",
    "we use @xmath8 @xmath9 ) to denote the masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath10 .",
    "we denote with 1 and 2 the eigenstates that are closest in mass ; moreover , we take @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 is always positive , while the sign of @xmath13 discriminates between the normal ( nh ) and inverted ( ih ) hierarchies , for @xmath14 or @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the neutrino mass eigenstates are related to the flavour eigenstates @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) through @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix @xmath20 , parameterized by the three mixing angles @xmath21 , one dirac ( @xmath22 ) and two majorana ( @xmath23 ) cp - violating phases .",
    "oscillation phenomena are insensitive to the two majorana phases , that however affect lepton number - violating processes like @xmath1 decay .",
    "the different probes of the absolute scale of neutrino masses are sensitive to different combinations of the mass eigenvalues and of the elements of the mixing matrix .",
    "@xmath0 decay experiments measure the squared effective electron neutrino mass @xmath24 , while @xmath1 searches are sensitive to the effective majorana mass @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "finally , cosmological observations probe , at least in a first approximation , the sum of neutrino masses @xmath28 .",
    "we perform a bayesian analysis based on a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , using ` cosmomc ` @xcite as a generic sampler in order to explore the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data .",
    "we consider the following vector of base parameters : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a `` nuisance '' parameter related to the uncertainty in nuclear modeling ( see below ) .",
    "we assume uniform prior distributions for all parameters .",

    "we consider data from oscillation experiments , direct measurements of the electron neutrino mass , @xmath1 searches and cosmological observations , all folded in the analysis through the corresponding likelihood function .",
    "our baseline dataset is the most recent global fit of the neutrino oscillation parameters @xcite , updated after the neutrino 2014 conference .",
    "we model the likelihood as a the product of individual gaussians in each of the oscillation parameters , since correlations can be neglected for our purposes @xcite . for the means and standard deviations ,",
    "we take respectively the best - fit value and the @xmath32 uncertainty quoted in tab .",

    "katrin is expected to reach sub - ev sensitivity in @xmath33 , while holmes could go down to @xmath34 .",
    "kinematic measurements are directly sensitive to the square of the effective electron neutrino mass , so in both cases we take the likelihood to be a gaussian in @xmath35 ( with the additional condition that @xmath36 ) , with a width given by the expected sensitivity of the experiment , i.e. @xmath37 for katrin and holmes , respectively . for @xmath1 searches , we consider the current data from the gerda experiment @xcite as the present dataset , its upgrade to the so - called `` phase 2 '' for the near - future , and the nexo experiment @xcite as a next - generation dataset .",

    "the level of background is usually expressed in terms of the `` background index '' , i.e. the number of expected background events per unit mass and time within an energy bin of unit width . for gerda - i",

    "we also consider an update to nexo in which the background in the inner 3 tons of the detector can be reduced by a factor 4 through @xmath68 tagging .",
    "we assume 10 years of observations for this updated version @xcite .    in order to account for the uncertainty related to nuclear modeling @xcite , including both that on nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) and that on the axial coupling constant , we compute @xmath38 for a given @xmath69 using fiducial values of these quantities , and then rescale it by a factor @xmath70 .",

    "the value of @xmath30 is extracted at every step of the mc from a uniform distribution in the range @xmath76 $ ] , and marginalized over .",
    "this is equivalent , for example , to assume that , given exact knowledge of the axial coupling , the numerical estimates of the nme can be wrong by up to a factor two in either direction . finally , for what concerns the cosmological dataset",
    ", we use results obtained combining full mission planck temperature and polarization data with data on the baryon acoustic oscillations @xcite , as both our current and forthcoming reference dataset . for simplicity , we shall refer to this dataset simply as `` planck 2015 '' .",
    "in particular , we use the chains publicly available through the planck legacy archive @xcite to derive the posterior distribution of @xmath77 given these data , corresponding to a 95% upper limit @xmath78 . as a next - generation experiment",
    ", we consider the euclid mission .",
    "the combination of all euclid probes ( weak lensing tomography , galaxy clustering and isw ) with data from planck is expected to constrain the sum of neutrino masses with a sensitivity of @xmath79 for @xmath80 , as reported in tab.2 and the main text in @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to this dataset simply as `` euclid '' .",
    "we model the likelihood as gaussian in @xmath77 , with @xmath81 and the addition of the physical prior @xmath82 .    to summarize , we consider four combinations of datasets .",
    "all of them include the most updated information from oscillation experiments .",
    "the `` present '' dataset includes planck 2015 for cosmology , and gerda - i for @xmath1 searches we do not include information from available direct measurements ( e.g. those from the troisk and mainz experiments ) since they do not add information on @xmath33 with respect to the data already considered .",
    "the `` forthcoming '' dataset consists of the same cosmological data as the previous dataset , gerda - ii , and katrin for kinematic measurements .",
    "the `` next generation i",
    "( ii ) '' dataset includes euclid , nexo without ( with ) @xmath68 tagging and holmes . for future data , we have to assume fiducial values of the parameters : in the case of the forthcoming dataset , we take them equal to their best estimates from the combination of oscillations and planck2015 . for the futuristic case ,",
    "we assume @xmath80 and estimate @xmath33 and @xmath69 from the combination of euclid and oscillation parameters .",
    "we present our results for @xmath77 , @xmath33 and @xmath69 in tab .",
    "[ res1 ] for the three datasets described above .",
    "we report limits both in the case where @xmath30 is fixed to 1 , and when @xmath30 is marginalized over , in order to show the impact of uncertainties in nuclear modeling .",
    "we quote our results , both in the text and table , in terms of the bayesian 95% minimum credible interval @xcite .",
    "when this interval includes the minimal value of the parameter allowed by oscillation measurements , we only quote the extremes of the range ; on the contrary , we report the mean @xmath83 the 95% uncertainty .",
    "we do this in order to emphasize a `` detection '' scenario  i.e. , one in which the observations point to a value of the parameter under consideration being different , with a given statistical significance , from the lowest value allowed by oscillations alone  from a `` non - detection '' scenario in which this oscillation minimal value is still allowed .",
    "we choose to identify the minimal value allowed by oscillations as the bayesian 95% c.l .",
    "lower limit of the neutrino mass parameters when the lightest eigenstate is set to zero . with this definition",
    ", we get @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) for nh ( ih ) .",
    "we would like to point out that the exact definition of the minimal value is somehow arbitrary , in a sense that it is not formally well - defined due to the finite precision of the oscillation measurements .",
    "for example , we could have chosen the lowest value allowed by fixing the oscillation parameters to their best - fit values , rather than computing the bayesian 95% lower limit , and this would equally make sense .",
    "this choice only affects the way in which limits are reported in tab .",
    "[ res1 ] ( and we verified that it also has a minor impact in that respect ) , so it does not alter our conclusions in any way . in any case , we recall that the confidence intervals represent a compression of the information contained in the one - dimensional posteriors , that fully represent the probability distribution associated to a given parameter . in fig .",
    "[ fig : post1d ] we show the marginalized one - dimensional posterior distributions for the mass parameters . in most cases ,",
    "the low mass region is excluded by the oscillation data , with the only exception of @xmath69 in the case of nh ; the reason is that in this case the phases can arrange in order to yield @xmath90 even for finite values of the mass differences .",
    "present data provide similar limits independently of whether nuclear uncertainties are marginalized over .",
    "this happens because the present constraints are dominated by the cosmological limit on @xmath77 , that translates directly to bounds on @xmath33 and @xmath69 once oscillation data are taken into account ( this can be understood by noticing that the direct limits on these parameters are much weaker ) .",
    "we have verified explicitly that this is the case by performing parameter estimation using only planck2015 and oscillation data , as shown in fig.[fig : post2d ] . in particular",
    ", we find that the present data constrain @xmath2 ( @xmath91 ) at 95% c.l . for nh ( ih ) ,",
    "regardless of the inclusion of @xmath1 information .",
    "forthcoming datasets yield similar constraints for the mass parameters ; this means that the improved sensitivity of gerda - ii and the inclusion of katrin add only marginally to the planck2015 plus oscillations data combination .",
    "the fact that present and forthcoming limits on @xmath69 are dominated by the latter dataset has the consequence that they do not depend on the modeling of @xmath1-decaying nuclei , nor on assumptions about the mechanism that induces the decay ( while , on the other hand , they are affected by the model dependence of the cosmological analysis ) .",
    "this picture changes substantially for next - generation experiments . in this case ,",
    "cosmological observations and @xmath1 searches have comparable power in constraining the mass parameters , and the nuclear uncertainties - as well as theoretical assumptions about the particle physics of 0@xmath922@xmath0 decay - play a role in deriving parameter constraints .",
    "we find that , if neutrinos are majorana and 0@xmath922@xmath0 decay is dominantly induced by the mass mechanism , marginal 95% evidence for non - minimal mass parameters can be obtained in the case of normal hierarchy , even when nuclear uncertainties are taken into account .",
    "this detection is further strengthened in the next generation - ii dataset , for which we get @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 . in the case of inverted hierarchy ,",
    "we obtain upper limits for @xmath77 and @xmath33 , and a more than 95% evidence for non - minimal @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , for the next generation - ii dataset and marginalizing over nuclear uncertainties , we find @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "finally , we report that while present and forthcoming experiments have little , if none , sensitivity to the neutrino mixing phases , the combination of next - generation experiments will possibly allow to determine the value of @xmath99 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phi2 ] .",
    "the combination of current and forthcoming data from oscillation , kinematic , @xmath1 and cosmological experiments allows to put upper bounds @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 for nh ( ih ) .",
    "these limits are dominated by the combination of oscillations and cosmological data and as such are not affected by uncertainties in nuclear modeling , nor rely on the knowledge of the particle physics mechanism leading to @xmath1 decay .",
    "if neutrinos are majorana particles and @xmath1 decay is induced by the exchange of light majorana neutrinos , and further assuming a total mass of @xmath103 and a factor 2 uncertainty in nuclear modeling , next - generation experiments will ideally allow to measure non - minimal mass parameters with a 95% accuracy better than @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 for @xmath77 , @xmath69 , @xmath33 respectively , for nh . in the case of ih ,",
    "the allowed parameter range is reduced by roughly 25% with respect to the present for @xmath77 and @xmath33 , while @xmath69 can be measured with a @xmath7 accuracy .",
