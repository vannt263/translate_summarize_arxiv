    "future long distance quantum information networks are expected to involve quantum repeaters . to this end",
    ", intense investigation is going on all over the world to interface a quantum state of light with an atomic ensemble . in protocols based on electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , the input signal",
    "is adiabatically converted into an atomic ground state coherence , without excitation of optical coherences .",
    "this class of protocols has been investigated intensively both theoretically @xcite and experimentally , leading to storage and retrieval demonstration of both discrete @xcite and continuous @xcite quantum variables .",
    "as it bypasses the optical coherence excitation , the eit based protocol is well adapted to atomic vapors , with strong transitions and short optical dipoles lifetime .",
    "rare earth ion doped crystals ( reic ) also offer long ground state coherence lifetime , which makes them attractive for quantum storage .",
    "however , in contrast with the atomic vapors considered in eit experiments , they also exhibit long optical coherence times .",
    "in addition , the active ions are strictly motionless , the hyperfine sublevel relaxation time may reach tens of hours , and the optical transition frequency is distributed over a very broad inhomogeneous width .    because of these specific features eit - based protocols may not be the most appropriate approach to quantum storage in this type of medium .",
    "actually , different protocols have been considered recently , based on rephasing processes@xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we propose a new adiabatic protocol , taking advantage of the specific reic properties .",
    "it is well known that a light pulse slows down when it propagates through a transparency window ( tw ) in an absorbing medium .",
    "deeper and narrower the transparency window , slower the light pulse .",
    "the group velocity @xmath2 is of the order @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively stand for the tw width and the linear absorption coefficient outside the tw .",
    "provided the input signal spectrum is narrower than the transparency window , the pulse undergoes little energy loss and shape distortion .    in eit",
    ", the tw is opened by a strong classical coupling field , interacting with the atoms simultaneously with the input signal .",
    "as the input signal is slowed down to group velocity @xmath6 , the pulse length and energy are reduced by a factor @xmath7 .",
    "the pulse energy is carried over to the coupling field , and the input signal quantum state is mapped into the ground state raman coherence .",
    "this coherence behaves as a spin wave that adiabatically follows @xcite the signal pulse , at the same velocity @xmath2 . by switching off the coupling beam",
    "one closes the tw .",
    "this simultaneously destroys the slowly propagating pulse and freezes the spin wave that already contains most of the signal information @xcite . to retrieve the stored information ,",
    "one turns on the coupling beam .",
    "interacting with the coupling beam , the frozen spin wave restores the signal pulse .",
    "conversely , the reviving light pulse drives the spin wave to the medium output where the initial energy is finally returned to the light signal by the coupling beam .    in reic , relying on the homogeneous width narrowness , the hyperfine relaxation slowness , and the absence of translational motion",
    ", one can prepare a narrow tw , by frequency selective optical pumping to a ground state shelving sublevel .",
    "this is nothing but the well known spectral hole - burning process . with an hyperfine level lifetime ranging from a few seconds to several hours",
    ", the preparation step can be completed long before the arrival of the input signal .",
    "after the preparation step , an input signal that is sent through the spectral hole undergoes the same slowing down as in eit @xcite .",
    "in contrast with eit , the energy and the signal state are both carried over to the optical coherence of the off - resonance atoms .",
    "the transient optical dipoles are created along the path of the signal field .",
    "their natural lifetime is much longer than the pulse duration , but they vanish adiabatically as the light pulse passes by . to `` stop '' the light and store the information",
    ", we propose to convert those optical dipoles into raman coherences , while the slowed down pulse is still confined within the absorbing medium .",
    "this can be performed by an auxiliary @xmath1-pulse , much shorter than the inverse tw width .",
    "another @xmath1-pulse shall restore the optical dipoles and release the stored information .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we describe slowing down and storage in section ii .",
    "section iii is devoted to the signal recovery .",
    "the latter section represents the core of the paper .",
    "we detail the revival of the signal from the restored optical coherence .",
    "specifically we determine the rising time of the retrieved signal , and its temporal profile .",
