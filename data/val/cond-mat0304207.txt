    "in recent years complex networks have attracted much of interest to model real - life networks such as social , biological and communication networks @xcite .",
    "certainly , introducing the essential static and dynamic features of these networks can help us in a better understanding of their various properties @xcite .",
    "a well known property of most of these networks , the so called small world property @xcite indicates that the average distance between any two nodes increases slowly with the size of the network ( i.e. as logarithm of the size ) .",
    "this in turn can lead to a fast spreading of effects in the network and so increases the finite size effects when one studies for example diffusion in such a network @xcite .",
    "extensive studies also indicate the importance of degree ( the number of neighbors of a node ) distribution for static and dynamic behaviors of the network @xcite .",
    "one can also add various kinds of correlations , e.g. degree correlation of two neighbors , to the list of these important features @xcite .",
    "+ protein interaction networks are important examples of the real - life networks in which nodes and edges represent proteins and interactions between them respectively @xcite .",
    "proteins have been traditionally recognized on the basis of their roles as enzymes , signalling molecules or structural components in cells and micro - organisms .",
    "the most rudimentary structural information about the proteome ( assembly of proteins in an organism ) is the pattern of interactions between different proteins .",
    "determining such connections , helps us in understanding the backbone of functional relationships between proteins and the pathways for the propagation of various signals among them . besides specific detailed information about the pattern of interactions in a single proteome , which are certainly important for its functioning , some general characteristics of these networks are also important in that they may point to universal properties of organisms .",
    "for example , it has been shown that as far as the interaction of individual proteins are concerned , the interaction network of the budding yeast _ saccharomyses cerevisiae _ ( _ s .",
    "cerevisiae _ ) is a scale free network .",
    "this property is itself a hint to the robustness of the protein interaction network against the random removal of proteins @xcite .",
    "+ however recent progress indicates that each of the central processes in a cell _ is catalyzed not by a single protein but by the coordinated action of a highly linked set of several proteins , called a protein complex _ @xcite .",
    "thus complexes act as protein machines and have been evolved for the same reason that humans have invented mechanical and electronic machines .",
    "it is also remarkable that a single protein may be shared in several different complexes .",
    "it is expected that a protein with a general functionality is shared by many complexes . on the other hand it seems that the weight of a complex depends on the degree of sophistication of its tasks .",
    "+ it is in view of this new emerging picture of the proteome as a coordinated ensemble of protein complexes that we study the general properties of the network of protein complexes of the budding yeast .",
    "certainly , analysis of the proteome map at both protein and complex level will result in a better understanding of the proteom functioning .",
    "although from a biological point of view the precise nature of proteins and their interactions in a single living organism are important , from a physical point of view in which we seek the general universal patterns among many different organism @xcite , we can study the most elementary features of a proteome , i.e. the weight distribution of complexes , distribution of the number of proteins shared between two complexes , etc .",
    "+ based on extensive information provided in @xcite we constructed a weighted graph corresponding to the network of complexes . by this",
    "we mean that both the nodes and the edges are assigned weights .",
    "the weight of a node is equal to the number of proteins in the complex it represents .",
    "two nodes are connected by a weighted edge , whose weight indicates how many proteins are common in the two complexes .",
    "such a point of view seems to be the first step to understand the integration and coordination of cellular functions .",
    "connections in this network not only reflect physical interaction of complexes , but may also represent common regulation , localization , turnover or architecture @xcite .",
    "in addition it has a meaningful interpretation in other real - life networks such as social networks when a connection between two communities can only be established by common individuals in them .",
    "note that one may consider a single protein complex as a subgraph of the protein interaction network with a high level of interconnection between its elements .",
    "from this point of view the protein complex network is a large scale or coarse grained picture of the protein interaction network .",
    "however , we stress that in view of the recent findings , this is not the correct picture for the interactome .",
    "in fact the important feature of the recent experiments @xcite compared to the previous experiments @xcite is that they uncover not only the pairwise interactions but ternary , quaternary and higher interactions between different proteins in a complex @xcite .",
    "+ in this work we show that the above protein complex network is a small world one with scale free degree distribution",
    ". moreover it is found that distributions of weights of complexes , weights of edges and coordination numbers of proteins ( the number of complexes a protein participates ) follow power law behaviors which can in turn refer to a kind of preferential attachment in the evolution of the protein complex network @xcite .",
    "we compare the network with some null models such as erds and rnyi random graph @xcite and a random - selection model in which each complex selects its proteins randomly from the list of all proteins . unlike the former case the latter model results in a considerable clustering for the network of complexes . here by clustering we mean the probability that two neighbors of a node be also connected to each other . in this manner",
    "the clustering is equivalent to the transitivity of the network ( defined as three times the ratio of the number of triangles in the network to the number of connected triples of nodes @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we find that the random - selection model can well reproduce the degree distribution of complexes and the dependence of degree of a complex on its weight .",
    "however some important distributions of the network such as weight of edges are still far from the predictions of this model in the region of large weights . following the previous models for the evolution of the protein interaction network @xcite",
    ", we propose a simple evolutionary model based on duplication and divergence ( mutation ) of proteins .",
    "we show that this model reproduces the power law behavior of some essential distributions such as weight of complexes and weight of edges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ( [ 2 ] ) is devoted to the description of the budding yeast protein complex network based on the data provided in @xcite .",
    "section ( [ 3 ] ) gives a comparison between the random - selection model and the real network .",
    "the evolutionary model is introduced in section ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we conclude the paper in section ( [ 5 ] ) .",
    "according to the data we have extracted from @xcite , the _ s. cerevisiae _ includes @xmath0 proteins , organized in @xmath1 complexes .",
    "the resulting network is then composed of @xmath2 nodes and @xmath3 edges .",
    "a complex of weight @xmath4 is denoted by a node of weight @xmath4 , and if two complexes share @xmath5 proteins , a weight @xmath5 is assigned to the edge connecting them .",
    "figures ( [ f1]-a ) and ( [ f1]-b ) show the distribution of weights of the nodes , @xmath6 , and weights of the edges , @xmath7 .        both distributions show the power law behavior ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) with exponents respectively equal to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , figures ( [ f1]-a and [ f1]-b ) .",
    "the observed deviation in the number of complexes of weight @xmath12 from the expected power law behavior could be mostly attributed to the experimental limitations @xcite .",
    "the average weight of the nodes and the edges turn out to be respectively @xmath13 and @xmath14 with the following dispersions : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "one could attribute the large values of these dispersions to the small size of the network and scale free nature of the related distributions .",
    "a curious property of the network is that there is no correlation between the weights of adjacent nodes . in other words , the probability that an emanating edge from a complex of weight @xmath4 encounters",
    "another complex of weight @xmath17 is independent of @xmath4 . to show this we compute the associated correlation coefficient @xcite , @xmath18 , which in the protein complex network has the value @xmath19 and",
    "is defined as follows : let @xmath20 be the probability that an arbitrary edge lies between two complexes of weights @xmath4 and @xmath17 . thus @xmath21 gives the probability of finding a complex of weight @xmath4 at the end point of an arbitrary edge .",
    "now the correlation coefficient is given by @xmath22 it is clear that in the absence of any correlation ( i.e. when @xmath23 ) we have @xmath24 .",
    "if similar complexes have a high tendency for being connected to each other we say that the network is assortative @xcite in this respect and the correlation coefficient will be positive .",
    "otherwise the network is dissortative and the correlation coefficient will be negative .",
    "obviously one can apply this definition to any two point distribution to measure the degree of correlation between the two variables .",
    "+ one may also ask what is the relation between the degree of a complex and its weight . our results again give a power law dependence for large values of complex weights .",
    "the total weight of edges emanating from a complex of weight @xmath4 ( its weighted degree ) scales as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , figure ( [ f2]-a ) .",
    "it is found that the number of neighbors behaves in a similar way @xmath27 with @xmath28 , figure ( [ f2]-b )",
    ". obviously @xmath29 grows faster than @xmath30 with the weight of complex as expected . roughly speaking , since @xmath31",
    ", the above relations suggest that the average weight of an edge emanating from a complex of weight @xmath4 scales as @xmath32 .",
    "+ to address topological properties of the graph we studied also the degree distribution , @xmath33 and the correlation between degrees of neighboring nodes which can again be detected by computing the related correlation coefficient , @xmath34 .",
    "note that by degree of a node we mean the number of neighboring nodes , irrespective of the weights of the edges emanating from that node . by weighted degree of a node we mean the sum of weights of the edges emanating from this node . in figure ( [ f3 ] )",
    "we show that the degree distribution is scale free with a sharp cutoff at its tail . in this figure",
    "we see also a power law fit of form @xmath35 with exponent @xmath36 to the real data . moreover , we find the value @xmath37 for @xmath34 which means that in contrast to the protein interaction networks @xcite , there is no strong correlation between the degrees of adjacent nodes in protein complex network .",
    "our results shows that the same conclusion is true if we take also the weights of the edges into account .",
    "+        usually a given protein takes part in more than one , say @xmath38 complexes .",
    "we call @xmath38 the coordination number of that protein .",
    "we found that on average a protein takes part in @xmath39 complexes ( with @xmath40 ) .",
    "figure ( [ f4 ] ) shows the number of proteins versus their coordination numbers , @xmath41 . the distribution is a scale free one for large coordination numbers , that is @xmath42 with @xmath43 as its exponent .",
    "this indicates that there are a few number of proteins with high coordination numbers .",
    "it seems that these are the proteins with exceedingly important role in the functioning of the cell .",
    "let us compute the correlation coefficient which measures the correlation between coordination of proteins and weight of complexes they contribute . to this end",
    "we consider the collection of proteins and complexes as a bipartite network in which nodes of the first type represent complexes and those of the second type represent proteins .",
    "an edge in this network connects a node of the first kind to a node of the second kind .",
    "thus the number of edges emanating from a protein determines its coordination number and similarly the number of edges connected to a complex gives its weight .",
    "now we define @xmath44 as the probability that an arbitrary edge of this bipartite network connects a complex of weight @xmath4 to a protein of coordination number @xmath38 .",
    "therefor @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively the probability that an arbitrary edge reaches to a complex of weight @xmath4 and a protein of coordination number @xmath38 .",
    "now the associated correlation coefficient is defined as @xmath47    we find that in the the case of our data @xmath48 which indicates to the absence of correlation in this respect . that is the coordination number of a protein does not affects in its relation with complexes of different weights more than what is expected by chance .",
    "+ the network of complexes also defines pathways for the propagation of various signals such as phosphorylation and allosteric regulation of proteins . for such functions ,",
    "a key parameter of the network is its diameter , defined as the shortest path between the remotest nodes in the giant component of the network .",
    "our analysis reveals that the network has a small diameter , @xmath49 , which points to the small world property of the network . to confirm this we also computed @xmath50 ( where @xmath51 denotes the shortest distance between nodes @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) and compared it with the corresponding quantity in an equivalent erds - rnyi random graph , table ( [ t ] )",
    "the reason behind the computation of @xmath50 is that the above graph is not connected rather it has a giant component of size @xmath54 , a binary component and @xmath55 single nodes . to have a measure of clustering in the network ,",
    "its transitivity @xmath56 was extracted and it has been found that it is almost six times greater than the one in an erds - rnyi random graph , see table ( [ t ] ) .",
    "this high level of transitivity which is another hint to the small world property of the protein complex network would give rise to the robustness of the network against the random removal of nodes or edges @xcite .",
    "to highlight the special features of the yeast protein complex network and to possibly draw conclusions of biological interest , one may compare it to a random network in which proteins aggregate randomly to form different complexes .",
    "we call such a model a random - selection model . the simplest such model may be constructed as a bipartite network @xcite as follows : one takes a bipartite network consisting of two types of nodes .",
    "nodes of the first type represent complexes and those of the second type represent proteins .",
    "a bipartite network of this kind consisting of @xmath57 complexes and @xmath58 proteins and the resulting weighted network consisting of only protein complexes are depicted in figure ( [ f5 ] ) .",
    "complexes and @xmath58 proteins .",
    "connections can only be established between proteins and complexes .",
    "( b ) the resulted weighted graph of protein complexes .",
    "the number of lines connecting two complexes represents the number of shared proteins.,width=302 ]    here we start from a bipartite network and calculate many of the properties of the resulting protein complex network exactly .",
    "a given complex @xmath59 contains a number of proteins which we denote by @xmath60 . in general @xmath61 . from the real data one can infer the actual sequence @xmath62 .",
    "one thus assigns free ( unconnected ) stubs to the first type of nodes ( the complexes ) according to this sequence and then connects these stubs randomly to the second types of nodes ( proteins ) .",
    "each protein connected to a complex means that it is contained in that complex . in this way one",
    "obtains another distribution @xmath41 , where @xmath38 is the number of complexes a given protein participates in .",
    "clearly a given protein may be contained in more than one complex .",
    "note that a peculiar feature of this model is that certain proteins may not be connected to any complex at all .",
    "later in this section we introduce another slightly improved model in which this effect does not happen .",
    "+ in the following we calculate many of the interesting quantities of the resulting weighted network of complexes exactly and compare them with real data to check the viability of this model .",
    "to proceed let @xmath63 denotes the number of complexes of weight @xmath4 .",
    "obviously @xmath64 , where @xmath57 is the total number of complexes .",
    "first let us calculate the probability of two complexes of weight @xmath65 and @xmath66 to have @xmath67 proteins in common .",
    "denote this probability by @xmath68 .",
    "the first complex chooses its @xmath4 members freely from the collection of all proteins .",
    "the second complex , has @xmath69 ways for choosing its members from the collection , of which @xmath70 ways are available for choosing @xmath5 members in common from the first complex and @xmath71 ways are available for choosing the remaining set disjoint from the first complex .",
    "hence the probability is @xmath72 .",
    "this equation can be rewritten in the form @xmath73 to make its symmetry under interchange of @xmath4 and @xmath17 manifest .",
    "the probability that two such complexes have no common members ( be not connected to each other in the network ) is : @xmath74 for @xmath75 one can approximates @xmath76 by @xmath77 and @xmath78 by @xmath79 .",
    "so the above relation takes the form @xmath80 thus the probability of two complexes being connected will be @xmath81 and the average number of edges will be : @xmath82 moreover the average number of edges with weight @xmath5 is given by : @xmath83 figure ( [ f6]-a ) shows this quantity for a model network with the same parameters as the yeast protein complex network .",
    "we see that the weight distribution of edges decreases exponentially in contrast to the power law behavior of the protein complex network .",
    "this means that in the yeast protein complex there are edges with very high weights .",
    "these high weight edges inevitably connect high weight complexes .",
    "thus in the yeast complex network , the hubs ( complexes with high degree ) are connected to each other intensively .",
    "this is in contrast with the protein interaction network @xcite where the high degree proteins have a larger tendency to be connected to low degree ones .",
    "+ in the same way one obtains @xmath30 , the average number of neighbors of a given complex of weight @xmath4 : @xmath84 in figure ( [ f6]-b ) we compare the above expression with the one obtained from the real network .",
    "one finds a good agreement between predictions of the model and the real data . from the distribution of weights of complexes @xmath6 and the above relation , one can obtain the distribution of degrees @xmath33 using the relation @xmath85 .",
    "thus we expect that degree distribution of the random - selection model to be also close to the real one . + what can be said about @xmath86 , the probability that a given protein contributes in @xmath38 complexes ?",
    "it is not difficult to show that due to the fully random nature of the selection process , the above distribution has a binomial form like @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the average weight of complexes .",
    "thus for very large values of @xmath57 and @xmath58 we have @xmath89 therefore we get a poisson distribution for coordination numbers of proteins in distinctive contrast to the real distribution which is scale free . +",
    "as seen from figure ( [ f6 ] ) , our analytical treatment of this model revealed that some of the general characteristics ( the degree of a given complex as a function of its weight and so the degree distribution of complexes ) of these networks are close to those of _ s. cerevisiae _ protein complex network .",
    "further results derived from numerical simulations given in table ( [ t ] ) show that random - selection model is rather close to the yeast protein complex network .",
    "+ note however that certain discrepancies between the random - selection model and the real complex network , i.e. in the distribution of the weights of edges , persist even if we improve this model by fixing the coordination number of proteins from the beginning to be the same as the one derived from real data of the protein complex network ( see figure ( [ f7 ] ) ) .",
    "the evolutionary model that we introduce in the next section is aimed to remove this discrepancy .",
    "in this section we introduce a simple model aimed at representing the evolution of protein complex network .",
    "the model is based on the extension of the hypothesis of evolution by duplications and divergence of proteins @xcite to the level of protein complexes .",
    "dna duplication has long been known as an important factor in the evolution of genome size .",
    "this process almost certainly explains the presence of large families of genes with related functions in biological complex organisms .",
    "consider a set of proteins which belong to a number of functional units or complexes . in each evolutionary step , the following actions take place .",
    "a protein is randomly chosen and duplicated .",
    "it means that a new protein is added to the proteome and contributes to all the complexes in which its mother participates",
    ". then the new protein undergoes mutations ; it loses its membership in any given complex with probability @xmath90 , and enters any other complex with probability @xmath91 .",
    "it is also probable that the protein creates a new complex ( novel functionality ) by its own with probability @xmath92 . in figure ( [ f8 ] )",
    "we have shown what happens in a typical step of network evolution .",
    "has been duplicated and edges of the new protein ( protein @xmath93 ) undergone mutations.,width=302 ]    note that during this process the new protein may not contribute to any complex and thus leaves the proteome .",
    "starting from one protein in one complex , we have taken @xmath94 evolutionary steps .",
    "we found that it was the best number of steps which could intimately produce the desired results .",
    "we found that in this situation only about @xmath95 percent of duplicated proteins are stuff and the others takes part at least in one complex .",
    "having @xmath96 we will also have the probability of creating a new complex in each step , because @xmath57 the number of complexes satisfies @xmath97 .",
    "the other parameters can also be determined by requesting that the number of proteins and some important distributions ( e.g. weight distribution of complexes ) be as close as possible to the real data .",
    "moreover , note that we also expect that the probability of entering a new complex for a duplicated protein must be much smaller than the probability of exiting one of its inherited complexes . summing up these points we find , by fitting to the real data , the following values for parameters of the model : @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "one can find results of this model in figure ( [ f9 ] ) and table ( [ t ] ) . +        in figure ( [ f9]-a ) we see that the model closely reproduces the scale free behavior of the weight distribution of complexes in the region of large weights although there are some deviations from the real data for the number of small complexes .",
    "indeed we expected such a power law behavior in advance due to the presence of preferential attachment@xcite in the process of evolution of complexes .",
    "note that although the selection of proteins for duplication is a completely random procedure , complexes with higher weights have a higher chance to include the new duplicated protein . in this way the evolution of complexes is governed by the well known mechanism of preferential attachment which is a principal way to produce scale free behaviors in the realm of complex networks@xcite .",
    "+ figure ( [ f9]-b ) shows the weight distribution of edges in the resulted protein complex network of the evolutionary model .",
    "the agreement with the real data is excellent .",
    "it is one of the essential features of protein complex network which none of the random models studied in this paper could exhibit it .",
    "we believe that this fact indicates to the essential role of duplication and divergence of proteins in the evolution of the protein complex network .",
    "+ moreover as table ( [ t ] ) shows the evolutionary model results in a small world protein complex network .",
    "both the transitivity and diameter of the model are comparable with the values of the real network of complexes .",
    "+ this model also exhibits a little tendency for being a negative correlated network in weights and degrees of neighboring complexes .",
    "indeed the related correlation coefficients turn out to be @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "it means that complexes with different weights and degrees have a larger probability to be connected to each other .",
    "+ finally it is worthwhile to note that the data studied in this paper are those of the yeast proteome whereas the results given in this section are the average behavior of such a proteome .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the protein complex network of the yeast is a nearly uncorrelated small world scale free network .",
    "the power law behavior was also found in other significant distributions such as weight of complexes , weight of edges and coordination number of proteins .",
    "although some of these features ( e.g. small world property and high clustering ) were expected in advance , this study revealed some distinctive properties of this network like the scale free behavior of weight distribution of edges .",
    "we also compared the yeast protein complex network with a random - selection model and a simple evolutionary model .",
    "it was found that the random - selection model can satisfactorily reproduce the relation between weight and degree of a complex and also degree distribution of the real network .",
    "however this model failed to give the power law behavior of the distribution of weights of edges , a property which could be well reproduced in the evolutionary model . in the latter model",
    "the desired distributions automatically arise by just fitting the model parameters using the real data . + from the evolutionary point of view , the above study can also be a hint to the essential role of duplication and divergence processes in the evolution of proteome and this study is indeed an extension of this mechanism to the level of protein complexes .",
    "certainly results of the previous studies on protein interaction network along with the investigation of large scale properties in the protein complex network will help in a better understanding of the general behaviors of such systems .",
    "+                                                              .comparison of the yeast protein complex network ( pcn ) with some models : erds and rnyi ( er ) random graph , the random - selection model ( rs ) , improved random - selection model and the evolutionary model .",
