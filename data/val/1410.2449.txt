    "overcontact binaries are close binary star systems in which one of the components has become engulfed in the expanding envelope of its evolving companion .",
    "the two stars are virtually indistinguishable and often appear to be of same effective temperatures , since they share a common envelope and are typically located at a separation of the same order of magnitude as the stellar radii . however , the components of overcontact systems are stars of different masses and at different evolutionary stages , with the added caveat that their evolution has been affected by the proximity of their companion .",
    "in fact , it is not uncommon to find overcontact systems in which the originally less massive component is now observed to be the more massive one thanks to accumulating the material lost during its companions evolution - driven expansion .",
    "this phenomenon , often referred to as the mass ratio reversal , can in principle happen more than once in the same system .",
    "yet it s only one of the many astrophysically interesting processes that can be inferred from the study of overcontact systems , like the exchange of energy and angular momentum , mass loss , interaction of stellar winds , magnetic activity and so forth . on the other hand",
    ", the small separation makes it more probable that an overcontact system will also be found to be eclipsing , which allows precise determination of orbital and stellar parameters from photometric light curves through the well - established methods for modeling of binary stars . considering all this ,",
    "it is clear why the case studies of bright , eclipsing overcontact binaries remain attractive even in the era of space telescopes and massive surveys .    in this paper",
    "we present the analysis of new , high quality ccd light curves , based on the results of up to date radial velocity studies of four overcontact eclipsing binaries : , , and .",
    "our findings suggest that and belong to the a subtype of w  uma binaries , while and are of w - subtype . in all four solutions ,",
    "we use dark or bright spots on one or both components to explain the asymmetries of the light curves .",
    "these inhomogeneities in surface brightness can be explained as either arising from photospheric activity , or resulting from mass and energy transfer .",
    "in addition to constraining the absolute masses and radii of the components of these four systems , we update their ephemerides using newly measured times of minimum light combined with all the previous measurements found in literature and calculate the distances based on the computed luminosities resulting from our models .",
    "we then estimate the age of each system by employing a novel method developed specifically for w uma type binaries @xcite .",
    "the age calculation is based on the estimated initial mass of the less massive secondary star , which can in turn be infered from the departure of its size and luminosity from values expected in a main sequence star of its mass ( see the cited work and the references within for a detailed explanation ) .    finally , we perform a period study for based on the o - c diagram constructed with all the available times of minimum light .",
    "we find the period variation can be fitted well with a superposition of a quadratic and a cyclic function , indicative of both mass transfer and either a third body in the system or magnetic activity on one of the components .    in what follows , we describe the technical details of the observations ( section  [ observations ] ) and the light curve analysis ( section  [ analysis ] ) , and then each system is discussed in turn .",
    "a summary of our results can be inspected at a glance from figures  [ fakher ] ,  [ fhidra ] ,  [ fv1128tau ] and  [ fv2612oph ] , as well as from the concluding remarks given in section  [ resume ] .",

    "the magnitudes and their errors in each band were computed in the sense of variable minus comparison ( v - c ) .",

    "it has been associated with a weak x - ray source @xcite , which is an indication of coronal activity .",
    "numerous authors published photometric light curves and times of minimum light .",
    "the variability of the orbital period was first noted by @xcite .",
    "@xcite did a through analysis of the variations in the light curves during the years prior to their study .",
    "they pointed out the changing levels of light curve minima and maxima , as well as the variability in spectral types and color indices , and ruled out the distant visual companion as the cause of period variation .",
    "a detailed study of the period changes was performed by @xcite , who found a long - term decrease and three rapid components of the variation .",
    "they interpret the slow variability in terms of mass exhange , and the rapid variations as pulsations of the common envelope .",
    "more recently , @xcite analyzed multicolor light curves of together with the radial velocity data from @xcite and calculated the absolute parameters .",

    "although they did not detect the signature of additional components in the spectra , they too argue , based on the observed light - time effect , that there must be an unseen companion to the system much closer than the visual pair . however , it has not yet been directly observed .    the present analysis of bvr@xmath43i@xmath43 light curves results in a model of in which the more massive , larger and hotter ( primary ) star is the one eclipsed in the deeper minimum ( figure  [ fakher ] ) .",
    "this makes a member of the a subtype of w uma binaries . from the summary of results given in table  [ tabakher ]",
    "it can be seen that the mass and the radius of the primary are near the expected values for a main sequence star of spectral class f4  v , adopted from @xcite , while the secondary is too large and overluminous for a main sequence star of its mass .",

    "we find the degree of overcontact is 33.2% , and place two dark spots that likely arise from surface activity on the primary star to account for the light curve assymetries .",

    "@xcite published the light curve and suggested that hi dra may be a @xmath16  lyr or an ellipsoidal variable , pointing that the difference of 0.02 mag between light curve levels prior and after the primary minimum is indicative of binarity .",
    "@xcite re - analyzed the hipparcos photometric data under the assumption that the object is a binary system , and determined a photometric mass ratio of 0.15 and an inclination angle of 52.5 degrees .",
    "the first spectroscopic study of , done by @xcite , confirmed the binary nature of the system .",
    "the authors calculated the spectroscopic mass ratio of @xmath48 , which is the value used in the present work , and determined the spectral class as f0@xmath49f2  v.    the results of our analysis of the new bvr@xmath43i@xmath43 light curves of are summarized in table  [ tabhidra ] and illustrated in figure  [ fhidra ] . due to the very low inclination ( @xmath50 ) , the light curve is of sinusoidal shape reminiscent of ellipsoidal variables , with minima of nearly equal depth .",
    "the slight asymmetry of the light curves is accounted for by adding a bright spot to the primary star in the neck region of the system .",
    "since it is the less massive secondary that is eclipsed in the deeper minimum , this is a w - type w uma binary with the degree of overcontact of 23% . within the estimated uncertainty ,",
    "the primary has a mass that could be expected from a class f0-f2 main sequence star , but a larger radius and luminosity .",
    "we find a faint third light in b and i@xmath43 bands . estimated distance of , based on the absolute parameters resulting from our analysis , is 304 @xmath47 27 pc , and its age , 2.01 @xmath47 1.18 gyr .",
    "one of the intermediate results of the age calculation is the initial mass of the secondary component , which in this case 2.14 m@xmath51 . according to @xcite",
    ", this indicates that the system should have evolved into an a - subtype w uma binary .",
    "however , when we made trial models with the a - subtype configuration , could not obtain a fit of satisfying quality , and the best solutions in such a case demanded greatly increased temperature of the secondary ( in excess of 1000 k above the temperature of the primary ) , which is nt characteristic of w  uma stars .",

    "using newly measured times of minimum light and all the available data from the literature , @xcite reported a long - term variation of the orbital period , which could be explained by applegate mechanism on one of the components .",

    "the light curves exhibit continual changes , minima of almost equal depths , and a slight asymmetry between maxima that we account for by putting a dark spot on the secondary component .",
    "the mass and radius of the primary are reasonably close to those expected from a main sequence f8 star .",

    "our results are in good agreement with the most recent photometric study of done by @xcite , with the exception of the presence of the dark spot ; namely , they presented a spotless solution , whereas we were not able to obtain a satisfying fit to the observations without the inclusion of a spot .",
    "we performed an o - c analysis of v1128 tau based on the photoelectric and ccd times of minimum light that we collected from the literature and observed ourselves . the o - c diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fv1128tauoc ] ) , displays a cyclic character superimposed on a quadratic variation .",
    "the quadratic variation can be explained by the mass exchange / mass loss in the system , while cyclic variation may be the result of the presence of a gravitationally bound third body or magnetic activity on one of the components ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the orbital period decrease of @xmath53 day yr@xmath54 is indicative of mass transfer from the primary to the secondary component at a rate of @xmath55 , unless mass is being lost from the system through some other mechanism , e.g. stellar winds .    considering a hypothetical third body gravitationally bound to the close binary , we determined the parameters of the light - time orbit as @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , using the oc2lte30 code @xcite , which is based on the formulation by @xcite",
    ".    the magnetic activity parameters of the secondary component can be calculated using the formalism of @xcite as an alternative explanation for the observed cyclic period variation . in this context , the period and amplitude of the cyclic period variation are found to be 12.54years and 0.105  scyc@xmath54 respectively , while the angular momentum transfer and the energy required for the angular momentum transfer are computed to be @xmath64 g@xmath65s@xmath54 and @xmath66 erg .",
    "the resulting variations in the luminosity and brightness of the secondary are then @xmath67 ergs@xmath54 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "all the parameters of the suggested quadratic and cyclic period variations are summarized in table  [ taboc ] .",
    "the o - c diagram for v1128 tau , based on all observations made so far , covers one incomplete cycle of the predicted variation .",
    "we thus refrain from drawing any definite coclusions about the mechanism for the suggested cyclic variation .",
    "further observations are needed to understand its nature and origin .",

    "its light curves were studied by several groups @xcite .",
    "@xcite did a spectroscopic analysis and determined the spectral class of the system as f7  v and its mass ratio as @xmath71 , which is the value used in the present work .",
    "they dispute the cluster membership of on the basis of the detection of a much fainter ( v = 12@xmath70.8 ) w - uma type cluster member , whereas the brightness of , when calculated using the distance modulus of given by @xcite , would have to be v@xmath69 = 11@xmath70.26 if it was a member of the cluster .",

    "there s a significant difference in the height of adjacent maxima , as well as a noticable asymmetry .",
    "these features are modeled by placing a dark spot in the polar region of each component . according to @xcite , the presence of spots at high latitudes",
    "can be explained by the dynamo mechanism for rapid rotators , and short - period , close binaries can be considered as such .",
    "the absolute parameters of the primary are in accordance with its spectral classification as a main sequence star .",
    "as the deeper minimum corresponds to the eclipse of the more massive primary star , this is an a - subtype w  uma binary .",
    "the degree of overcontact is 22% , the distance is 173 @xmath47 5 pc , and the age of is 5.11 @xmath47 1.79 gyr . the distance and age of indicate that it should not be a member of cluster , which has a distance of 376  pc and age of 425  myr ( according to webda ) .",
    "these findings are in good agreement with the results of previous studies , with one exception : @xcite classifies as a w - subtype w  uma system .",
