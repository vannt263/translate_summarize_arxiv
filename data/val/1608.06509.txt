    "the study of gravitational collapse is an important issue in classical general relativity .",
    "usually , the stellar objects such as white dwarf and neutron star are formed through a collapsing process .",
    "also in astrophysical collapse one should match the interior and exterior space - time of the collapsing object through the proper junction conditions .",
    "long back in 1939 oppenhiemer and snyder @xcite initiated the study of gravitational collapse with interior space - time represented by friedmann like dust solution with a static schwarzschild exterior .",
    "since then several authors have extended this study of gravitational collapse . in the following , we shall mention some of the important and realistic generalization of the above pioneering works : ( i ) misner and sharp @xcite considered the perfect fluid collapse with the same static exterior , ( ii ) using vaidya s @xcite idea of outgoing radiation of the collapsing body , santos and collaborators @xcite considered dissipative collapsing matter by allowing radial heat flow ( _ i.e. , _ radiating collapse ) . on the other hand ,",
    "cissoko et al @xcite and goncalves @xcite studied junction conditions of a non - static collapsing object with a static interior .",
    "gravitational collapse in the presence of dark energy has been investigated by mota et al @xcite and cai @xcite et al .",
    "the discovery of hawking radiation has shown a nice interrelationship between black hole and thermodynamics .",
    "subsequently , it is found that there is a deep inner relationship between gravity and thermodynamics .",
    "so it is interesting to consider the thermodynamical analysis of a collapsing massive star which sinks under the attraction of its own gravity and at the end of its life cycle either black hole will form or it will appear as a naked singularity , depending on the nature of the initial data . in particular , it is curious to know the validity of the thermodynamical laws during the collapsing astrophysical object .    in recent years , a lot of works @xcite have been done in cosmology in the perspective of non - equilibrium thermodynamics within the framework of particle creation mechanism .",
    "the main motivation of these works is to explain the well known observational evidence that our universe is going through an accelerating phase since recent past .",
    "it is found @xcite that by proper choice of the particle creation rate ( as function of hubble parameter ) the late time accelerated expansion can be described in the context of einstein s general relativistic theory ( grt ) without introduction of any exotic matter ( dark energy ) .",
    "also recently @xcite it is shown that the above models not only describe the late phase of the evolution but also describe the entire cosmic evolution since inflation to @xmath0cdm model .    the present work is also related to the particle creation mechanism but in context of well known astrophysical problem namely the final fate of a massive collapsing star .",
    "we shall address the question whether the particle creation mechanism favours formation of bh or helps the collapsing star to become a naked singularity .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section ii , the basic idea of collapsing mechanism has been presented , collapsing solutions and relevant physical properties for various choices of the particle creation rate has been shown in section iii . section iv deals with junction conditions and relevant physical interpretations with schwarzschild - de sitter as the exterior space - time .",
    "the thermodynamics of the collapsing star has been discussed in section v. a field theoretic description has been shown in section vi .",
    "the paper ends with a brief discussion and concluding remarks in section vii .",
    "in the present work , the matter of the collapsing star is chosen in the form of perfect fluid with barotropic equation of state @xmath1 , while the dissipative phenomena due to non - equilibrium thermodynamics is in the form of bulk viscosity .",
    "for simplicity , the thermodynamical system is chosen as isentropic ( _ i.e. , _ adiabatic ) in nature so that the entropy per particle is chosen as constant . as a result",
    ", the effective bulk viscous pressure is determined by the particle creation rate @xcite as @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the particle creation rate , @xmath4 is the effective bulk viscous pressure ( due to dissipation ) , and @xmath5 is the hubble parameter . for simple collapsing situation , we assume the space - time inside the massive core as homogeneous and isotropic _ i.e. , _ the inside geometry is characterized by the flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model @xmath6 and it is a particular case of the inhomogeneous oppenheimer - snyder model @xcite . here",
    "@xmath7 is the scale factor and @xmath8 is the metric on unit 2-sphere .",
    "further , in analogy to cosmology where the curvature effects are not important at the early stages of the evolution @xcite . it is speculated that the same thing happens for the late stages of the collapsing core .",
    "the main question that we shall have to address is the end state of collapse  a black hole ( bh ) or a naked singularity ( ns ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ the singularity is covered by an apparent horizon or not .",
    "apparent horizons are space - like surfaces with future point converging null geodesics on both sides of the surface @xcite . in fact , the apparent horizon is a trapped surface lying in a boundary of a particular surface @xmath9 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath9 is a two - sphere embedded in a slice @xmath10 of space - time @xmath11 , and let @xmath12 be the outward - pointing space - like unit normal to @xmath10 and @xmath13 , the future pointing time  like unit normal to @xmath10 so that @xmath14 is a null vector .",
    "then the surfaces will be called marginally trapped surface if @xmath15 holds everywhere on @xmath9 @xcite .    for the present frw model , the apparent horizon",
    "is characterised by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the area radius .",

    "@xmath19 , where @xmath20 are the initial area radius and hubble parameter of the collapsing core .",
    "here @xmath21 denotes the boundary of the collapsing star and we have on @xmath10 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 is the area radius of the bounding surface .",
    "the metric outside the collapsing star in general can be written in the form @xcite @xmath25 + in view of the exterior space - time , the surface @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath26 .",
    "israel s junction conditions on the boundary have been discussed in details by cai and wang @xcite .",
    "once dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath28 on @xmath29 and @xmath30 is known , it is possible to determine the time evolution of @xmath31 , and @xmath28 along the hypersurface @xmath10 .    for gravitational collapse @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the geometric radius of the two spheres @xmath34constant .",
    "the mass function due to cahill and mcvittie @xcite is defined as @xmath35 thus the total mass of the collapsing cloud is @xmath36 note that the inequality [ eq4 ] should hold at the initial epoch so that the collapsing process starts from regular initial data .",
    "further , if the above inequality holds throughout the collapsing process then the collapse will evidently not formed bh .",
    "it should be noted that although the total mass given by eq .",
    "[ eq8 ] and the global structure of the bh depends on the space - time geometry outside the star ( and also on the matching conditions ) but the basic question of bh formation depends crucially on the development of apparent horizon inside the core  not on the matching conditions and the choice of space - time outside the star .",
    "although in the present work we shall address the question whether a collapsing massive star will become a bh or not at the end stages of its collapse , still we have explicitly mentioned the junction conditions to compare the collapse dynamics for schwarzschild and schwarzschild - de sitter model as the exterior of the collapsing star    further , it should be mentioned that supermassive bhs ( as at the galactic centre ) or recently discovered quasar at redshift @xmath37 and mass @xmath38 @xcite which is speculated to be formed from huge massive collapsing star cores of population iii has extremely large mass due to cosmological accretion mechanism and mergers in the course of their evolution .",
    "we only concentrate ourselves to the discussion related to bh and naked singularities , formed from collapsing star cores .",

    "the section deals with a description of the collapsing process from the field theoretic point of view , _ i.e. , _ the whole dynamical process , ( _ i.e. , _ the collapsing scenario ) is considered as the evolution of a scalar field @xmath191 having self interacting potential @xmath192 .",
    "equivalently , the collapsing sphere containing effective imperfect fluid can be described by a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "thus , the energy density and the thermodynamic pressure of the cosmic substrum can be described by the scalar field quantities as @xmath193 hence for the present adiabatic thermodynamical system scalar field quantities can be expressed as @xmath194 note that in the above expression in eq .",
    "[ eq81 ] , we have eliminated the dissipative term @xmath4 by the isentropic condition equation [ eq1 ] , particle creation rate @xmath3 is obtained from the eq .",
    "[ eq13 ] and we have used the first friedmann equation [ eq9 ] to eliminate the energy density @xmath195 .",
    "now , from the above expression of [ eq81 ] both @xmath191 ( integrating first eq . of [ eq81])and @xmath192 can be written in parametric form ( with @xmath5 as the parameter ) for different particle creation rate as in * table - iii*.",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyze the physical process during collapsing phase of a star .",
    "the inside matter of the spherical star is chosen as perfect fluid with barotropic equation state @xmath196 ( @xmath46 , a constant ) .",
    "the collapse dynamics is assumed to be a non - equilibrium thermodynamical process having dissipation due to particle creation mechanism . for simplicity , the thermodynamical process is assumed to be isentropic ( _ i.e. , _ adiabatic ) in nature so that the dissipative effect behaves as bulk viscous pressure and is related linearly to the particle creation rate [ see eq.[eq1 ] ] . although the choice [ in eq.[eq13 ] ] of the particle creation rate is purely phenomenological but it has some justification from cosmological scenario @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that @xcite such choice of particle creation rate can describe the cosmic evolution from inflation to present accelerating phase up to phantom barrier .",
    "the curiosity about the collapsing process is due to the lack of definite conclusion about the final fate of the object .",
    "it is interesting to examine whether the cosmic censorship conjecture ( ccc ) of penrose is obeyed or violated by the collapsing mechanism .",
    "we have examined the final fate of the collapse by comparing the time of collapse and the time of formation of the apparent horizon  whether the final singularity is covered or not by the apparent horizon for various choices of the parameters involved in the choice of the particle creation rate .",
    "it is found that in some cases we have definite conclusion about the final phase of collapse ( bh or ns ) and in other cases depending on some restrictions related to the parameters involved the end state of collapse may be bh or ns .",
    "also we have examined the thermodynamical laws particularly the second law during the collapsing phase .",
    "it is found that depending on some restrictions it is possible to have an increase of entropy during the collapse both for bh or ns as the final state of collapse .",
    "interestingly , it is found that in some cases where ns is the definite end state the restrictions in the two time intervals namely @xmath197 and @xmath198 are contradictory .",
    "so the second law of thermodynamics will be violated in any one of the time intervals .",
    "but in other cases we do not have such definite conclusion .    in the present collapse dynamics of a spherical star",
    ", exterior geometry is chosen as schwarzschild or schwarzschild - desitter space - time .",
    "the junction conditions on the boundary show a energy conservation equation on it , the corresponding newtonian force with cosmological constant @xcite is @xmath199 as for collapse dynamics , the required force should be attractive in nature , so the area radius @xmath30 should have an upper bound @xmath200 .",
    "also , the rate of collapse is given by @xmath201 from the above expression , we may conclude that the collapsing rate is much faster when the exterior space - time is schwarzschild rather than the schwarzschild - de sitter model .",
    "physically , the cosmological term put some outward pressure to the collapsing star and hence delayed the collapsing process . also in the context of recent observations the cosmological constant plays the role of dark energy and is best fitted with observations .",
    "finally , one should note that due to the presence of a cosmological constant ( de ) , a potential barrier is induced into the equation of motion . as a result",
    ", particles with a small velocity will be unable to reach the central object . for future work",
    ", it will be interesting to use this idea astrophysically for a particle orbiting a de black hole so that an estimation of minimum velocity with which the particle can enter the inside of the bh and consequently , the amount of de inside the bh may be determined .",
