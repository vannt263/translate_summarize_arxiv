    "differential algebraic and ( co)homological methods have rapidly sprung up in theoretical physics in connection with the development of gauge theories .",
    "their interventions occur at two levels , firstly at a classical level under a more systematic use of the calculus of differential forms , secondly under the emergence of the brs methods in connection with the quantization of gauge theories .",
    "in fact the brs technique provides an explicitely local and relativistic invariant way to develop perturbation theory for quantum gauge theories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing here that one can not overestimate the role of the locality principle in perturbative renormalization @xcite . independently of these perturbative developments ,",
    "methods for quantizing constrained systems on phase space have been developed using the path integral @xcite which were obviously related . in both cases",
    "enter  ghosts \" @xcite and the occurrence of a differential , i.e. an endomorphism of square zero .",
    "it turns out that the latter construction essentially reduces to a  homological \" description of classical constrained systems @xcite in which the ghosts and the differential have a natural interpretation in terms of standard mathematical concepts @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ here we shall not give a systematic exposition of the above topics but , instead , we shall follow a sort of transversal way .",
    "these notes give a survey of appropriate concepts and results in homology which will be illustrated at each level with examples of application in theoretical physics .",
    "furthermore recent developments in a generalization of homology will be reviewed as well as some physical applications .",
    "+ the plan is the following . in section 2",
    "we give the basic definitions and results on homology of differential modules . in section 3",
    "we introduce graduation , that is we discuss complexes and give several examples ; in this section we explain the constructions connected with simplicial modules and we describe the tensor product of complexes .",
    "section 4 is a physical illustration of the fact that there is no natural tensor product of differential modules whereas there is one for complexes ; we show there that the introduction of ghosts at the one - particle level in the free field theory is worthwhile to render the theory natural over the physical space . in section 5",
    "we introduce @xmath0-differentials and discuss the generalization of homology associated with @xmath0-differential modules ; we give there several examples of constructions some of which are related to physics ( e.g. parafermions ) .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the corresponding graded situation i.e. to @xmath0-complexes ; we recall there the constructions of @xmath0-complexes associated to simplicial modules and the result which expresses in these cases the generalized homology in terms of the ordinary one ( theorem 2 ) @xcite . in section 7 which summarizes results of @xcite , @xcite",
    ", we introduce @xmath0-complexes of tensor fields on @xmath1 generalizing the complex of differential forms and we state the corresponding generalization of the poincar lemma ( theorem 3 ) ; we also explain why these @xmath0-complexes naturally enter the theory of higher spin gauge fields . in section 8",
    "we discuss graded differential algebras and their  @xmath0-generalization \" and give a universal @xmath0-construction generalizing the usual universal differential calculus over a unital associative algebra @xcite , @xcite .",
    "section 9 describes the homological approach to  subquotients \" and applies it to constrained systems ( brs - method ) .",
    "the main result , theorem 4 , is slightly more general than the results of @xcite ( more general context ) , so we give a sketch of proof of lemma  10 on which it relies . finally in section 10 we generalize constructions of the previous section to @xmath0-differential modules in connection with a quantum gauge group problem arising for the zero modes in the wess - zumino - novikov - witten model ; this section is a summary of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . + these notes contain almost no proof , many results are classical or easy .",
    "there are two notable exceptions , namely theorem 2 and theorem 3 the proof of which are absolutely non trivial although their meaning is transparent .",
    "+ let us say some words on our conventions . for sake of completeness",
    "we have given the formulation in terms of modules over a commutative ring @xmath2 ; the tensor product symbol @xmath3 without other specification means the tensor product over @xmath2 ( of @xmath2-modules ) , i.e. @xmath4 .",
    "in the physical examples @xmath2 is either the field @xmath5 of the field @xmath6 , so the reader may well understand @xmath2 like that and then the @xmath2-modules are vector spaces over @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "we use throughout the einstein convention of summation of repeated up - down indices .",
    "a diagram of mappings between sets is said to be a _ commutative diagram _ if given two path of mappings between ( two vertex ) two sets of the diagram , the corresponding compositions of mappings coincide .",
    "a _ young diagram _ is a finite collection of boxes , or cells , arranged in left - justified rows , with a weakly decreasing number of cells in each row .",
    "given a young diagram of @xmath7 cells @xmath8 , one associates to it a projector @xmath9 , the young symmetrizer , on the space of covariant tensors of degree @xmath7 on @xmath1 by the following procedure .",
