    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the main decay mode of positive muons is the decay into a positron and two neutrinos @xmath2 . assuming conservation of the additive lepton family or flavor ( lf ) numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the neutrino flavors are fixed to be @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the neutrinos are massless with the  being a left - handed neutrino , the  a right - handed anti - neutrino .",
    "the structure of the muon decay can be described by the v  a theory of weak interactions .",
    "therefore @xmath7 decay as a purely leptonic process has been used to study with high precision the sm of weak interactions .",
    "the lorentzian v  a structure of the  decay can be tested by measuring the massive leptons , i.e. the initial and the final  @xcite or by investigating the neutrino energy spectrum @xcite . however , to test conservation of the lf numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 in @xmath7 decay it is essential to observe the final neutrino states @xcite .",
    "all tests so far show no deviations from the sm .    however , the lf number violating decay mode  is allowed in many extensions of the sm , e.g. left  right ( lr ) symmetric models @xcite , gut models with dileptonic gauge bosons @xcite , extensions involving additional scalar multiplets @xcite or supersymmetric models with r parity violation @xcite , together with the lf number violating decay  @xcite .",
    "although the energy scale of lr symmetry of weak interactions or the appearance of supersymmetric particles is expected to be in the range of 0.11tev , precision measurements at intermediate energies can provide essential restraints on the parameters used in various models .",
    "therefore , the detailed investigation of the  decay plays a major role in determining the structure of weak interactions and the precision of lepton number conservation .",
    "on the other hand , there are clear evidences for neutrino oscillations from experiments on atmospheric , solar and reactor neutrinos @xcite .",
    "since @xmath8 oscillations violate the conservation of the lepton family numbers , such results enhance the interest of searching for direct lf number violation .",
    "in addition , there is a positive  signal from the accelerator experiment lsnd @xcite which could be explained a priori as an indication for  oscillations of  from  or directly for the decay mode . due to limited statistics and energy resolution ,",
    "this ambiguity is not resolved by the lsnd experiment itself .",

    "in this letter we report the results of the search for  from  decay at rest ( dar ) .",
    "note that  from non sm interactions can be produced by either  in the isis target or by oscillations  of  on their way to the detector with  being produced at isis in sm decays .",
    "while the  energy spectrum is fixed in the dar  with a spatial flux according to a @xmath9 dependence , the energy and spatial distributions of  from oscillations strongly depend on the oscillation parameters , i.e. the mass difference @xmath10 . with its excellent energy resolution of @xmath11}$ ] , the karmen detector is able to separate different scenarios for potential  occurrence . although the search for oscillations  and for the decay  use the same detection reaction  for , the different physics and consequently the different  spectral distributions result in two separate analyses .",
    "in the sm , applying the v  a theory , the energy spectra of massless neutrinos from  decay  can be calculated neglecting radiative corrections as @xcite @xmath12d\\epsilon    \\label{michel}\\ ] ] with the relative energy @xmath13 , @xmath14mev for the decay at rest , and the michel parameter @xmath15 for ( ) , respectively .",
    "looking for physics beyond the sm , s from  in general have non - zero mass and contributions of left- or right - handed chirality eigenstates .",
    "as only the  in the decay  is identified in the experiment , the second emitted ( anti)neutrino @xmath16 is not determined . since our experimental result sets upper limits on , these limits also apply for the specific case @xmath17 , which is the dominant one for certain model assumptions @xcite .    taking the actual direct mass limits for , @xmath18ev @xcite ( and hence for  and masses through the mixing manifested in the experiments on neutrino oscillations ) , the @xmath8 masses are very small compared to the mass of the charged leptons or the energy scale of the neutrinos from  decays at rest . assuming majorana type neutrinos , the  of left - handed chirality emitted in the sm decay  could be detected via the reaction  since there is no distinction between  and  .",
    "however , the detection of s emitted in muon decays with left - handed helicity would be strongly helicity  suppressed ( @xmath19 for a neutrino of 10mev energy and a rest mass of 2ev / c@xmath20 ) since only right - handed anti - neutrinos are absorbed via . in the case of dirac type neutrinos",
    ", the above argument applies for left - handed chirality states of the emitted .",
