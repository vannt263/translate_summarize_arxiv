    "the counter - propagating wave approach is commonly used to study the electromagnetic response of spatially nondispersive , homogeneous and isotropic plane - parallel - faces linear media ( fabry - perot framework ) .",
    "it consider forward and backward monochromatic plane waves to derive the optical properties as the transmittance and reflectance @xcite .",
    "this method uses the conventional variables of electromagnetic fields : moduli and phases of these waves which should be found from the helmholtz equation with the corresponding boundary conditions .",
    "it is well - known that for a single harmonic plane wave propagating through an unbounded linear medium , the time - averaged poynting vector modulus is equivalent to the squared - field amplitude modulus @xcite .",
    "this statement is generally accepted even if the wave propagation takes place in bounded linear media .",
    "the counter - propagating approach does not point out the possible nonequivalence between the above magnitudes since utilizes the amplitudes and phases as field variables .",
    "however , the phase of the wave can be replaced by the time - averaged poynting vector modulus as field variable . then the time - averaged poynting vector and the squared - field amplitude modulus can be monitored simultaneously within the medium so that the conditions that leads to the nonequivalence among them will manifest naturally in this equivalent frame .",
    "the so - called s - formalism use the time - averaged pointing vectos as a field variable .",
    "it was recently introduced @xcite and applied to study the optical response of nonlinear slabs .",
    "the nonequivalence between the time - averaged poynting vector and the squared - field amplitude modulus was the key to define a nonlinear medium whose nonlinearity is proportional to the time - averaged poynting vector modulus .",
    "its transmittance was calculated and found to differ with that obtained for the kerr medium , whose nonlinearity is proportional to the squared - field amplitude modulus .",
    "however , the method was not yet used to analyze the linear case .",
    "therefore , the aim of this paper is to apply the s - formalism to study the optical properties of homogeneous , isotropic and spatially non - dispersive dielectric as well as ohmic conductor media , inside the fabry - perot frame complementing to the well - known results of this problem within the counter - propagating wave approach .",
    "the s - formalism shows , in direct form , how this non - equivalence is related to the superposition dynamic of opposite traveling waves which is only possible in bounded media . also , the exact transmittance is compared with that given by the approximated beer s law , commonly used in experiments , and appreciable differences were found for certain material parameters values . moreover ,",
    "the reflectance of positive and negative permittivity media are considered and interesting results appears for small absorption when negative permittivity accounts .",
    "it must be stressed that the s - formalism does not substitute the counter - propagating wave approach because the idea of forward and backward waves within the medium has a deep physical content .",
    "however , the alternative method adds conceptual and practical implications that remains hidden when the conventional scheme is utilized .",
    "we believe that both methods should be complementary , helping for a complete physical understanding on wave propagation in bounded linear media .    below , this paper reviews the principal features of the s - formalism introduced in ref . as function of the new set of field variables .",
    "then , it is applied to derive the spatial evolution of both variables for absorbent and nonabsorbent linear media showing the cases in which the equivalence does not hold true , and their causes and consequences .",
    "finally , practical implications of this features are explored : the comparison between the exact transmittance and the beer s law , and the analysis of positive and negative permittivity media .",
    ", wave vector @xmath0 and frequency @xmath1 strikes a linear , non - magnetic , homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially non - dispersive plane - parallel - faces , to be reflected and transmitted .",
    "the field in region ii can be represented by a general complex field of real amplitude @xmath2 and phase @xmath3 .",
    "the regions i and iii constitute , for simplicity , the same linear dielectric medium ( e.g. , air ) . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the reflection and transmission complex coefficients , respectively ; @xmath6 is the dimensionless propagation coordinate.,width=283 ]    when a linear , non - magnetic , homogeneous , isotropic , and spatially non - dispersive plane - parallel - faces medium of dimensionless thickness @xmath7 is excited perpendicularly by a plane wave ( see fig .",
    "[ fig = problema ] ) , the s - formalism @xcite states that the transmittance and reflectance are respectively      where @xmath9 is the field variable , representing the dimensionless time - averaged poynting vector modulus , given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the incident intensity with @xmath12 , the vacuum permittivity , @xmath13 the unit vector in the @xmath14 direction , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the electric field amplitude modulus and phase , respectively . @xmath15 and @xmath16 evolve according to the coupled system @xcite          @xmath18_{\\tilde{z}=0}=4,\\label{eq = condecont1}\\\\[3pt ] & & \\left[s-\\mathcal{e}^{2}\\right]_{\\tilde{z}=\\tilde{d}}=0,\\\\[3pt ] & & \\left[\\frac{d\\mathcal{e}}{d \\tilde{z}}\\right]_{\\tilde{z}=\\tilde{d}}=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      being @xmath19 , the relative permittivity , and @xmath20 , the relative conductivity . from eq .",
    "( [ sye ] ) it is clear that @xmath9 and @xmath2 are equivalents only when @xmath3 is a linear function on @xmath14 .",
    "this point is not , in general , emphasized in the literature .",
    "thereby , it is mandatory to ask : is the equivalence of both magnitudes generalized to cases where it could be not longer true ? .",
    "an example : in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy flux of a tem@xmath21 gaussian beam propagating in free - space is calculated from the squared - field amplitude modulus instead of the time - averaged poynting vector which could lead to non - physical results .",
    "for details see appendix [ appendix ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq = poyntinhtheo ] ) represents the time - averaged poynting theorem being @xmath22 the responsible for the energy loss in the medium .",
    "here we used it _ explicitly _ to analyze and solve wave propagation problems in bounded media . on the other hand , note that , eqs .",
    "( [ eq = condecont ] ) are independent of the medium properties .",
    "also , the second interface produces different values of @xmath23 and @xmath9 at the first interface through the spatial dependence of @xmath2 , as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq = condecont1 ] ) .",
    "however at the second interface @xmath23 and @xmath9 are always equals with the advertisement that this should not lead to false view that they are equivalents .",
