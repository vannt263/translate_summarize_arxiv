    "electron spin resonance ( esr ) has proven to be an important method in identifying the ground state of strongly correlated electron systems .",
    "esr helped e.g. to identify the ordered spin - density wave ground state in the bechgaard salts @xcite and for carbonaceous materials , esr was key to discover the ac@xmath0 ( a = k , rb , cs ) fulleride polymer @xcite . +",
    "a natural expectation is that esr can be applied for single - wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) @xcite and graphene @xcite , which are the two novel members of the carbon nanostructure family .",
    "the esr literature on graphene is yet restricted to a single report @xcite .",
    "although there exists larger literature on the swcnts , the situation is yet unclear . in general , the esr signal on itinerant electrons yields a direct measurement of the spin - relaxation time ( often called as spin - decoherence time ) , @xmath1 , through the relation : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the homogeneous esr line - width and @xmath4 is the electron gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "@xmath1 is the central parameter which characterizes the usability of the materials for spintronics .",
    "this explains the motivation of the esr studies on graphene and swcnts .",
    "+ one important question is whether the esr signal of the itinerant ( i.e. the conduction electrons ) can be observed at all .",
    "it was argued on a theoretical basis @xcite that it can not be observed due to the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ground state of the metallic swcnts @xcite .",
    "it seemed that the only way to explore the local magnetism in swcnts is to spin label it either by means of @xmath5c nuclei @xcite or by an electron spin label @xcite .",
    "the literature situation on the swcnt esr studies is conflicting , and it is reviewed herein without any judgement on validity .",
    "@xcite reported the observation of the esr signal of itinerant electrons .",
    "@xcite reported that the esr signal occuring around @xmath6 is caused by defects in the swcnts .",
    "@xcite reported that a similar signal is related to the itinerant electrons with a possible antiferromagnetic order at low temperature .",
    "@xcite reported the observation of the itinerant electron esr in swcnt samples prepared by chemical vapor deposition .    often , the identification of the itinerant electron esr signal is based on two facts : the asymmetry of the esr lineshape ( also known as a dysonian ) and the temperature independence of the esr signal intensity .",
    "the dysonian lineshape also occurs for localized spins ( e.g. for paramagnetic impurities ) which are embedded in a metal thus this property can not be used for the above identification .",
    "this is discussed as eq .",
    "3.6 in the seminal paper of feher and kip as the `` slowly diffusing magnetic dipole case '' @xcite .",
    "the temperature independence of the esr intensity could be observed for localized paramagnetic spins when they are embedded in a metal with increasing conductivity , @xmath7 with decreasing temperature ; then the microwave penetration depth @xmath8 ( here @xmath9 is the permeability of the vacuum and @xmath10 is the frequency of the microwaves ) .",
    "there has been remarkable progress in the quest for the intrinsic esr signal in swcnts using samples made of nanotubes separated according to their metallicity @xcite .",
    "however , both kinds of samples , i.e. those made of purely metallic or semiconducting nanotubes shows similar esr signals @xcite , thus the situation remains unresolved .",
    "a parallel situation happened for high @xmath11 superconductors : soon after their discovery @xcite several reports claimed to have observed the `` intrinsic '' esr signal in these compounds .",
    "later it turned out for all studies that the signal of parasitic phases ( which happen to have strong paramagnetic signals ) , the so - called green and brown - phases were observed .",
    "later , spin labeling ( e.g. gd substituting y in yba@xmath12cu@xmath13o@xmath14 ) turned out to be successful to study the electronic structure @xcite .",
    "the esr signal of itinerant electrons in the swcnts is expected to have i ) a @xmath15-factor near 2 , ii ) a line - width , @xmath3 smaller than 1 mt , and iii ) a signal intensity corresponding to the low density of states ( dos ) with no temperature dependence .",
    "all properties present a significant hindrance for the signal identification since most impurity in carbon have @xmath16 , a maximum 1 mt line - width , and the curie spin - susceptibility of even a small amount of impurity overwhelms the small pauli susceptibility of the itinerant electrons . since nothing is known about the @xmath15-factor and the line - width _ a priori _ , only the magnitude of the calibrated esr signal when compared to the theoretical estimates of the pauli spin - susceptibility provides a clear - cut esr signal identification in graphene or swcnts .    here , we outline the method to determine the calibrated esr signal intensity and the resulting dos in one- and two - dimensional carbon . the method is demonstrated for k doped graphite powder which is regarded as a model system of biased graphene @xcite .",
    "a good agreement is obtained between the theoretical and expeirmental dos for the kc@xmath17 doped graphite system .",
    "we note , that a similar program was applied successfully when the esr signals of rb@xmath13c@xmath0 @xcite and mgb@xmath18 @xcite were discovered .",
    "we give benchmarks which can be used to decide whether the esr of the itinerant electrons is observed in graphene .",
    "we used commercial graphite powder ( fischer scientific ) and potassium ( 99.95 % purity : sigma - aldrich ) for the intercalation experiments . the graphite powder ( 3 mg )",
    "was mixed with 3 mg mno : mgo powder ( mn concentration 1.5 ppm ) and ground in a mortar .",
    "mgo separates the graphite powder pieces , which enables the penetration of exciting microwave and its mn content acts as an esr intensity standard .",
    "the mixture was vacuum annealed at 500 @xmath19 for 1 h in an esr quartz tube and inserted into an ar glove - box without air exposure .",
    "alkali doping was performed by heating the esr quartz tube containing the graphite powder and potassium for 29 hours using the standard temperature gradient method in ref .",
    "@xcite to obtain stage i , i.e. kc@xmath17 intercalated graphite .",
    "esr measurements were performed with a jeol x - band spectrometer at room temperature .",
    "cccccccccccc & & & & & & + & & & & & + & & & & & +    first , we discuss spin - susceptibility , @xmath20 , calculated from the esr signal in different dimensions .",
    "esr spectroscopy measures the net amount of magnetic moments , which is an extensive thermodynamic variable , i.e. proportional to the sample amount .",
    "the corresponding intensive variable , which characterizes the material is the spin - susceptibility , @xmath20 which reads as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the magnetic moment , @xmath23 is the magnetic field of the resonance , @xmath24 is the volume in @xmath25 dimension ( @xmath26 ) , and @xmath9 is the permeability of the vacuum . clearly , the unit of @xmath20 depends on the dimension @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath20 is either due to the curie spin - susceptibility for non - interacting spins or the pauli spin - susceptibility for itinerant electrons in a metal .",
    "the relevant expressions are given in table [ susceptibilities ] .",
    "therein , @xmath27/@xmath28 denotes the unit area / volume , @xmath15 is the @xmath15-factor , @xmath29 is the bohr moment and @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "@xmath31 is the spin state of the non - interacting spins and @xmath32 is the dos at the fermi level in units of @xmath33 . here , @xmath34 refers to the unit chosen , e.g. for c@xmath0 fulleride salts , the unit could be 60 carbon atoms .",
    "then the dos is larger but so is the unit volume which cancels in the result . for graphene",
    ", the two atom basis is used as @xmath34 .",
    "the esr intensity of a metal can be calibrated against a curie spin system with known amount of spins .",
    "this leads to the comparison of the pauli and the curie spin - susceptibilities :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 denotes the esr signal . @xmath24 and @xmath37 are the volume of the sample and the unit cell in @xmath25 dimensions , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath38 is the number of units in the metallic sample and @xmath39 is the number of curie spins .",
    "( [ chi_curie_div_pauli ] ) is correct for both si and gaussian units and is independent of the choice of @xmath34 , as expected .    for @xmath40 and @xmath41 , eq .",
    "( [ chi_curie_div_pauli ] ) simplifies to : @xmath42     esr spectrum of saturated k doped graphite powder sample at @xmath43300 k. the inset shows a zoom on the esr spectrum showing the presence of the six lines of the @xmath44 hyperfine structure .",
    "the solid curve is a fit . ]    .",
    "[ calib2 ] parameters of the @xmath20 calibration of kc@xmath17 . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we present the case of kc@xmath17 as an example of the esr intensity calibration . in fig .",

    ". parameters of the calibration are given in table [ calib2 ] : @xmath45 is the spin concentration and the effective @xmath46 as only the @xmath47 transition is observed from the 5 zeeman transitions of the mn@xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) @xcite .",
    "the sample content gives : @xmath50 and eq .",
    "( [ chi_curie_div_pauli ] ) yields @xmath51 , in good agreement with @xmath52 obtained by specific heat measurements @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we analyze the case of graphene .",

    "consequently , @xmath61 if @xmath58 is measured in ev .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ chi_c_div_p_simple ] ) ( in two dimensions ) at room temperature reads :    @xmath62 \\frac{n(\\text{gr})}{n(\\text{curie } ) } \\label{chi_graphene_div_curie } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    @xmath63 is the number of graphene unit cells in the sample .",
    "finally , we assess the feasibility of esr spectroscopy on graphene .",
    "esr spectrometer performance is given by the limit - of - detection ( lod@xmath64 ) i.  e.  the number of @xmath40 curie magnetic moments at room temperature which are required for a signal - to - noise ratio of @xmath65 for @xmath66 mt linewidth , and 1 s / spectrum - point time constant .",
    "for modern spectrometers lod@xmath67 spins/0.1 mt . to calculate the lod for a broadened esr line , lod@xmath68 , we introduce a function to track the effect of broadening :    @xmath69    this function is 1 if @xmath70 and it is 10 if @xmath71 which is the usual maximum modulation amplitude . for line - widths above this value , the function grows quadratically , which describes that the amplitude of the derivative esr signal drops quadratically . using this function :",
    "comparison with eq .",
    "( [ chi_graphene_div_curie ] ) yields that numerically ( @xmath58 in ev units ) @xmath74 is the lod for graphene . we could conclude that @xmath75 which gives a lower bound for the area of the graphene sheet which enables the esr measurement . assuming a @xmath76 mt and a shift in chemical potential by gate bias of @xmath770.2 ev we estimate @xmath78 .",
    "in summary , we detailed the method of obtaining the calibrated esr intensity and the dos in carbonaceous materials .",
