    "the interest in zero energy modes extends to more than a decade and to all areas of physics@xcite .",
    "it was recently revived owing to the emergence of graphene@xcite and topological insulators@xcite .",
    "the zero modes are believed to signal non - trivial lattice topology and are connected to excitations of fractional charge@xcite .",
    "they also exist in the spectrum of a bipartite lattice ( two interconnected sublattices ) if the total number of lattice sites is odd@xcite . in the presence of off - diagonal disorder which connects the two sublattices , in the so - called chiral disordered systems ,",
    "a zero mode is a critical point ( mobility edge ) of the anderson metal - insulator transition .",
    "the dirac point of graphene is a stable zero mode in two dimensions ( @xmath1 ) which becomes a critical point for appropriate off - diagonal disorder , and zero modes with half - integer charge appear in superconducting bogolyubov - de gennes systems as majorana fermions@xcite .",
    "graphene has attracted immense interest in the last decade . in this novel material",
    "the electrons can be described by dirac equation and its band structure displays two valleys ( act as pseudo spin states ) related by time - reversal@xcite .",
    "the fermi surface has two non - equivalent dirac points so graphene is a semimetal or a zero gap semiconductor , at long length scales it has a linear energy dispersion with a density of states which goes to zero at @xmath0@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "disorder causes anderson localization for all states in @xmath1 disordered systems , at least in the limit of infinite size@xcite .",
    "this is expected also for graphene since the honeycomb lattice has a coordination number even smaller than the square lattice .",
    "our interest here is the so - called off - diagonal disorder , which appears in the random hopping among the sites of two interconnected sublattices @xmath5 , @xmath6 ( mirror images of one another ) , of a bipartite @xmath1 lattice such as the honeycomb lattice of graphene . for graphene off - diagonal disorder between nearest neighbours ( n.n . )",
    "can appear by removing lattice bonds at random , it can simulate ripples , etc .",
    "it is expected ( as diagonal disorder ) to mix graphene s two - valleys and if correlated to break time - reversal symmetry by decoupling valleys , etc . the off - diagonal disorder ( random hopping between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) is different from usual diagonal disorder ( random site energies ) , in the sense that it respects the discrete chiral ( sublattice ) symmetry@xcite .",
    "the chiral disordered systems were classified by three random matrix ensembles ( the chiral universality classes bdi , aiii , cii)@xcite .",
    "a zero mode can exist at @xmath0@xcite where the chiral system undergoes a metal - insulator transition in @xmath1 driven by topologically induced anderson localization@xcite .",
    "this type of localization is shown via non - perturbative field - theoretic techniques and is controlled by vortex - like excitations of the sigma model , via a mechanism similar to the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition@xcite .",
    "the chiral symmetry of the hamiltonian @xmath7 , with random hopping among the @xmath5 , @xmath6 sublattices , manifests itself in the energy spectrum which is composed of random energy pairs @xmath8 , where @xmath9 labels the eigenvalues of the same sign . for an odd total number of lattice sites the spectrum is symmetric around @xmath0 and allows zero modes which can not match , as required by chiral symmetry , any of the positive or negative @xmath10 s .",
    "in fact , the @xmath0 mode matches to itself .",
    "a zero mode is a critical state which emerges among localized states for topological reasons , the localization length ( and the density of states ) diverges at @xmath0@xcite . in @xmath1 off - diagonal disorder can localize all non - zero states , the only exception is the zero mode@xcite .",
    "we shall show that off - diagonal disorder can localize even the zero mode when it becomes strong@xcite . in the original treatment of chiral",
    "systems@xcite no traces of weak localization ( quantum interference ) was found to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "we show that the critical zero mode displays multifractal fluctuations@xcite described by a fractal dimension @xmath2 , which tends to zero as the disorder becomes very large .",
    "in other words , for strong off - diagonal disorder the zero mode state becomes localized in agreement with @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to study the multifractal properties of the zero mode in the absence of magnetic field or spin - orbit coupling , that is for a hamiltonian @xmath7 with real random hopping among @xmath5 and @xmath6 which belongs to the chiral orthogonal class @xmath11 .",
    "this @xmath7 has a mobility edge in @xmath1 which is a zero mode . in the absence of chiral symmetry in @xmath1",
    "a mobility edge can exist only in two circumstances , if the usual orthogonal universality class is replaced by the symplectic with spin - orbit coupling , or by the unitary class with added magnetic field . in the presence of disorder two mobility edges",
    "usually appear as critical points of an anderson transition . for a chiral @xmath1 system they merge into one at the zero mode whose origin is topological@xcite .",
    "our study has an advantage over @xmath12 , where mobility edges usually exist , since they are more difficult to handle .",
    "for the chiral class bdi in @xmath1 we compute the fractal dimension @xmath2@xcite of the zero mode state .",
    "this is done in order to see the fate of the dirac point of graphene in the presence of off - diagonal disorder .",
    "one might also ask the question about the difference of the obtained @xmath2 between a honeycomb and a square lattice , since both lattices with appropriate off - diagonal disorder belong to the same chiral class bdi . another question addressed in this paper is whether the critical zero mode localizes for strong disorder and the nature of its localization .",

    "all ensemble averages are invariant under sign changes of the wave function and the single particle averages are site - diagonal@xcite .",

    "can be estimated by the participation ratio ( outside the localization region denoted by @xmath52 the states usually decay exponentially ) . at the zero mode",
    "the localization length diverges logarithmically and precisely at @xmath0 takes any value which depends strongly on the choice of boundaries@xcite . at the anderson transition a critical wave function lies at the mobility edge",
    "which separates extended ( chaotic ) from localized states .",
    "the multifractal states in the border between chaotic and localized states have filamentary structure and are described by multifractal dimensions@xcite . in the chiral problem studied , however , no chaotic ( diffusive ) states exist and the critical zero mode emerges among localized @xmath1 states only .",

    "we focus only on the fractal dimension @xmath2 for @xmath65 .",
    "the @xmath2 ( known as correlation dimension ) describes scaling of the inverse participation ratio @xmath66 for large @xmath64 .",
    "the @xmath67 gives information for the degree of localization ( it is the inverse for the number of lattice sites participating in the state ) .",

    "the multifractal dimensions @xmath72 for the wave function are closely related to scaling for the moments of the local density of states , e.g. for the zero mode they can represent correlation functions for the local density of states .",
    "we have solved the linear equations of eq.(5 ) for the honeycomb lattice which consists of @xmath73 horizontal zig - zag chains ( the width of the lattice is @xmath74 in units of @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the distance between carbon atoms ) and @xmath77 the number of sites for each chain ( the lattice length is @xmath78 in units of @xmath79 ) .",

    "these zero mode states appear due to the lattice topology ( the hilbert space structure ) , for diagonal disorder see @xcite .",

    "one could denote this disorder as a point of a freezing transition ( difference between averaged and typical values)@xcite .",
    "the main difference between graphene and square occurs for zero disorder , where for graphene the zero mode state has a fractal dimension @xmath3 , which corresponds to a wave function localised along the zz edge ( edge state ) , while for the square @xmath88 for an extended state . for finite values of disorder",
    "the @xmath2 s in graphene take values between one ( the wave function is localised on the edge of the sample ) and zero . for strong disorder",

    "in this paper we have studied the multifractal properties of the zero modes which appear in chiral orthogonal systems ( class bdi ) for an odd number of lattice sites .",

    "the multifractal zero mode is influenced by the system boundaries even for infinite system size , e.g. for graphene the boundaries are responsible for the edge state structure of the dirac point in the presence of off - diagonal disorder@xcite .",
    "a chiral system allows the presence of a mobility edge in @xmath1 while the scaling theory of localization@xcite forbids critical states in @xmath1 orthogonal non - chiral systems . off - diagonal disorder which respects chiral symmetry allows a topological critical state which is a zero mode in @xmath1 .",
    "the problem of zero modes , apart from its intrinsic interest , is significant in other areas of physics .",
    "the first examples were found in the eighties and it is progressively realised that they are important in disordered systems , e.g. they can describe the low - energy physics of disordered spin chains , which can be mapped into disordered fermions by jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "our findings support the idea that the origin of the zero modes is geometric .",
    "ther multifractality is shown in two chiral disordered @xmath1 systems , for the honeycomb and the square lattice .",
    "the obtained zero modes are found to behave rather similarly , unless finite size effects are present .",
    "their difference depends strongly on the topology of the perimeter , e.g in graphene for no disorder the zz edges on the perimeter can lead to zero energy modes .    in conclusion , for an odd number of lattice sites a topological zero mode exists for chiral disordered systems which is a mobility edge of an anderson transition in @xmath1 .",
    "we have compared its multifractal properties for graphene and the square lattice with n.n . off - diagonal disorder . in both cases",
    "the isolated critical zero mode emerges within the localized @xmath1 states and has amplitude only on one of the interconnected sublattices @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "the complex quantum interference in disordered systems which usually leads to anderson localization is absent in chiral systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite a perturbation theory found no traces of localization for chiral systems , however , non - perturbative effects@xcite showed topological localization .",
    "we confirm these results .",
    "the zero mode has no topological protection against localization which occurs for strong off - diagonal disorder ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "our conclusions should remain valid for other chiral systems , e.g. if the time - reversal invariance is broken by a magnetic field and the invariance over spin - rotation by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "an old idea , whether physics can be reduced to geometry , is supported by the presence of lattice topology and multifractality in disordered systems . in @xmath1 topological phenomena ( non - perturbative )",
    "exist , e.g. the quantum hall effect@xcite , etc .",
    "we have shown anderson localization in chiral disordered systems appears in a topological sense , e.g. at the zz edges of graphene .",
    "the presence of zero modes is topologically protected by chiral symmetry but their criticality is not protected since they localise for strong disorder .",
    "the zero modes are also connected to fractional charges and monopoles@xcite .",
    "the obvious extensions of this work is to obtain the whole spectrum of multifractal dimensions @xmath92 $ ] , which they are expected to be a non - trivial function of @xmath93 , and generalize this study to the other chiral universality classes , aiii , cii@xcite .",
