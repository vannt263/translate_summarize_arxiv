    "volcanic explosions generate both seismic and acoustic waves propagating in the ground and in the atmosphere , respectively . monitoring the acoustic emissions thus represents , together with the seismic signals monitoring , an attractive tool to investigate the source of volcanic explosions .",
    "in particular , the simultaneous recording of the seismic and acoustic signals might provide clues to constrain the source process ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , the link between the seismic and acoustic waves and the explosive source dynamics is still poorly understood .",
    "some authors claim that seismic and acoustic waves are generated by an unique shallow process ( @xmath0  m depth ) @xcite .",
    "others propose that the acoustic waves are produced by the bursting of meter - sized gas bubbles , while the seismic waves result from the pressure variations , in the magma column , associated with the rise of the gas bubbles toward the surface @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , almost all studies assert that acoustic waves are generated either by the bursting of the gas bubbles @xcite or by the oscillation of the magma membrane covering the gas slug just before the bursting @xcite .    the acoustic wave characteristics , in the infrasonic range ,",
    "are commonly related to the properties of the bursting bubble , such as its volume and overpressure before bursting @xcite . however , most of these analysis are theoretical and numerical ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "only a few laboratory experiments were dedicated to characterizing the acoustics of bubble bursting in conditions that are relevant to volcanology @xcite .",
    "here we investigate experimentally the bursting , in static conditions , of a slug whose parameters ( geometry and overpressure ) are accurately controlled .",
    "the characteristics of the acoustic signal emitted at bursting ( frequency , energy ) are compared with the initial bubble geometry ( volume ) and overpressure .",
    "this experiment focuses on the physical mechanisms at stake when the overpressurized cavity suddenly opens .",
    "because the dynamics of bubble bursting on volcanoes is much more complex , we will not compare directly our experiment with the field situation .",
    "however , the physical processes we describe here are likely to be involved when a large gas bubble explodes at the top of a volcano vent ( figure  1a ) .",
    "we therefore comment the results in regard to potential implications for large bubbles bursting on volcanoes .",
    "we discuss further ( section  5 ) the limits of this application .",
    "our experimental setup consists of a cylindrical cavity drilled in a plexiglas slab ( figure  1b ) . following @xcite",
    ", we close the cavity by stretching a thin soap film . air is injected inside and , due to the increase in the inner pressure , the thin soap film deforms and bulges out .",
    "injection is stopped when a chosen overpressure @xmath1 is reached .",
    "the system then remains in mechanical equilibrium , while the soap film drains the liquid aside @xcite and eventually bursts .",
    "this controlled experiment makes possible to easily vary the length and volume of the cavity , and the gas overpressure before the film bursting .",
    "different tube lengths @xmath2 ( from 2 to 23  cm ) and diameters @xmath3 ( 6 , 8 or 10  mm ) have been used ( aspect ratio @xmath4 ranging from 2 to 23 ) in order to quantify the role of the conduit geometry .",
    "the rupture of the film results in a sudden drop of the inner overpressure , which excites resonant modes inside the cavity .",
    "the inner standing waves are damped due to dissipation along the walls and radiation out of the open end of the cavity .",
    "a microphone inside the tube ( figure  1b , bottom ) records the pressure variation at the cavity bottom ( @xmath5 ) while a microphone outside ( figure  1b , top ) monitors the radiated acoustic waves ( @xmath6 ) . as expected for a resonating tube , both signals , inside and outside , exhibit the same spectral content , with a fundamental frequency associated with the wavelength in air @xmath7 and odd harmonics @xcite .",
    "note that the location of the inner microphone is pertinent , as the amplitude of the pressure variation associated with all the harmonics is maximum at the cavity bottom .",

    "the overpressure @xmath1 inside the cavity is constant .",
    "we thus expect , in the absence of significant energy loss , to measure @xmath20 .",
    "we found that this is true only for long tubes ( @xmath21 , large gas volume ) whereas for short tubes ( @xmath22 , small gas volume ) a large scatter of the pressure drop is observed , with @xmath23 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this scatter can be explained by taking into account the film rupture dynamics , and in particular its typical rupture time @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is approximated , from the experimental data , as the time necessary for the overpressure at the cavity bottom to drop from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the characteristic film rupture time is compared to the propagation time @xmath25 of the acoustic wave inside the tube , defined as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the sound velocity ( @xmath28  m / s ) .",
    "the experiment indicates that the initial relative amplitude @xmath29 is a strongly decreasing function of the ratio @xmath30 ( figure  3a ) .    , and the propagation time @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath6 is recorded at @xmath31  cm from the cavity aperture .",

    "insets : _ ( a ) semi - log plot of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath33 .",
    "the efficiency of the bubble bursting to transmit pressure waves in the air drastically drops for slow rupture dynamics ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "the most efficient energy partitioning occurs for the shorter tube ( dark gray region ) .",
    "[ symbol,@xmath11 : [ @xmath12,@xmath13 ; [ @xmath14,@xmath15 ; [ @xmath16,@xmath17 . ]    in other words , for a given geometry , the larger the characteristic rupture time is , the smaller is the amount of energy transferred to the resonant modes @xcite . for @xmath32 ,",
    "we observe a drastic drop in the amplitude @xmath5 of the signal inside the cavity .",
    "long cavities ( large aspect ratio , e.g. @xmath21 ) are not sensitive to the film rupture time , as they always fulfill the condition @xmath35 . in this case , the acoustic amplitude inside the tube well approaches the initial overpressure , and @xmath36 ( figures  2 and 3a ) . to the contrary , for short cavities ,",
    "the system is sensitive to the film rupture time , which is on the order of @xmath25 , and a large scatter is observed .",
    "the uncontrolled bubble rupture time thus accounts for the scatter of the acoustic energy measured outside the cavity ( @xmath6 , see section  4 ) .    on volcanoes",
    ", we do not have access to the acoustic waves inside the slug , and we measure the acoustic signal propagating outside . when a slug bursts , part of the energy is radiated as infrasonic waves in the atmosphere , while part remains trapped in the volcanic body and propagates as seismic waves .",
    "we consider here that the overpressure recorded by the internal microphone ( @xmath5 , figure  1b ) represents the amplitude ( and/or the energy ) of the seismic signal generated by the explosive process , while the pressure outside the cavity ( @xmath6 ) is comparable to the amplitude of the acoustic waves recorded in the atmosphere as infrasonic waves .",
    "therefore , by comparing the amplitude ratio between the internal and external pressure variations ( figure  3b , inset ) , we assume to observe a process similar to the amplitude ( or energy ) partitioning between seismic and acoustic waves associated with the same explosive dynamics .",
    "our experiment indicates that the inside and outside pressure partitioning ( @xmath34 ) changes as function of the tube length and hence , of the bubble volume .",
    "longer tubes have acoustic waves with long propagation time and with large damping effects due to viscous dissipation . as a consequence",
    ", the amplitude of the acoustic signal outside the cavity will be much smaller than for short tubes ( figure  3b , inset ) .",
    "in other words , long tubes ( e.g. @xmath37  cm ) are more efficient in terms of acoustic wave energy trapped inside the cavity ( figures  2 and 3a ) , but are not efficient to transmit acoustic energy outside ( figure  3b , inset ) .",
    "in contrast , short tubes ( e.g. @xmath38  cm ) are more efficient in radiating acoustic energy outside ( figure  3b , inset ) , but are also more sensitive to the rupture time ( @xmath32 , figure  3a ) .",
    "if the energy loss for long tubes is mainly due to the non - efficient radiation process ( small @xmath34 ) , the energy loss for short tubes ( higher @xmath34 ) is mainly due to the film rupture time ( @xmath32 ) . in both cases ,",
    "energy is dissipated .",
    "in order to quantify the total energy balance in the system , we estimate the acoustic energy @xmath39 from the signal measured outside : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the distance between the cavity aperture and the microphone , @xmath42 the gas density , and @xmath27 the sound velocity in air . the potential energy stored inside the slug before bursting can be written as : @xmath43 where @xmath8 is the volume of the gas slug .",
    "figure  4 displays the acoustic energy measured outside , as a function of the initial slug overpressure , before bursting .",
    "the three different experimental conditions represent the field situation , where the conduit radius is constant in time , but the slug length can vary from one explosion to another @xcite .",
    "we report in figure  4 the maximum total acoustic energy estimated from a series of 10 measurements , performed in similar conditions ( same @xmath1 ) .",
    "each point then represents the acoustic energy obtained when the rupture time is the smallest .",
    "its effect is therefore considered negligible ( @xmath44 ) .    for small initial overpressure @xmath1 ,",
    "the acoustic energy @xmath39 behaves as @xmath45 .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , the bubble deforms and the soap film curvature increases .",
    "consequently , when the film bursts , the pressure front entering the cavity is spherical , and thus no longer matches the planar geometry of the resonant modes . as a consequence , the efficiency of the energy transfer decreases and @xmath39 drops down when @xmath1 is increased ( figure  4 ) . finally , we point out that this simple bubble bursting can not build up gas overpressure above the maximum threshold . for a bubble bursting in static condition ,",
    "the threshold pressure @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 ( semispherical film ) , where @xmath48 represents the film surface tension .",
    "in summary , two mechanisms limit the energy tranfer to the acoustic waves .",
    "first , the characteristic rupture time of the film breaking ( section  3 ) ; second , the film curvature before bursting . indeed , as the film curvature increases , the pressure of the acoustic wave front generated at bursting departs from a planar wavefield .",
    "it is therefore less efficient in exciting the cavity resonant modes .",
    "this explains why , in the experiment , the fraction of energy , @xmath49 , measured outside is small ( @xmath5015% ) @xcite , and points out the importance of the geometry and dynamics of the film rupture in controlling the amount of energy released in the atmosphere as acoustic waves .    on volcanoes ,",
    "the velocity of the film rupture and the film geometry itself are much more complex than in our experiments performed in static conditions , and depend largely on the dynamics of the bubble rising and on viscosity , temperature and volatile content of the magma film layer above the bubble .     as a function of the initial overpressure @xmath1 ( normalized to @xmath46 ) for different lengths ( same diameter @xmath51  mm ) .",
    "all data represent the maximum pressure recorded outside over a series of ten measurements .",
    "we assume that this value corresponds to the signal recorded when the rupture time is negligible ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "[ symbol,@xmath11 : [ @xmath12,@xmath52 ; [ @xmath53,@xmath54 ; [ @xmath55,@xmath56 . ]",
    "this simple experiment provides an insight into the physical mechanisms involved in the bursting of a slug of well - controlled geometry and overpressure , in static conditions . even in a fully controlled laboratory experiment , the amplitude and energy of the pressure wave propagating into the atmosphere after bursting",
    "can not be predicted from the initial slug overpressure - and vice versa .",
    "we demonstrated that two processes are responsible for this unpredictability : ( 1 ) the rupture time of the bubble film , which can not be controlled in the experiments ; and ( 2 ) the energy loss due to the film curvature at bursting , which excites more or less efficiently the cavity . when the rupture time @xmath24 is larger than the characteristic propagation time @xmath25 inside the cavity , the acoustic signal amplitude ( and , thus , the energy ) drops .",
    "the energy fraction ( @xmath57 ) transferred into the acoustic signal radiated outside decreases drastically when the rupture time @xmath24 increases .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the much more complex field situation is out of the scope of this paper . indeed ,",
    "when a slug bubble rises and bursts in a volcanic conduit , viscous and inertial forces - two processes not investigated in this work - play an important role . on the one hand , by limiting the bubble expansion when rising , these forces are thought to be responsible for the large overpressure stored inside the slug before bursting @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", viscous effects may strongly affect the dynamics of the film aperture @xcite .",
    "experiments investigating bubbles bursting in either a newtonian @xcite or non - newtonian @xcite fluids pointed out the importance of the rising velocity and , more generally , of the bursting dynamics , on the acoustic wave amplitude .",
    "however , even if in static conditions , the physical mechanisms described here are likely to be at stake in the field . different rupture dynamics and film thicknesses largely affect the rupture time , and the acoustic signal emitted at bursting .",
    "in particular , we point out that any interpretation of the measured acoustic amplitude , or energy , in terms of gas overpressure in the bubble before bursting requires a good knowledge of the physics controlling the opening of the bubble at bursting .",
    "this suggests that on volcanoes also , the amplitude of the acoustic waves generated by the bubble bursting strongly depends on the thickness and on the rupture velocity of the bubble cap at bursting .",
    "both features are uncontrolled in the field , and could explain the low correlation observed at stromboli volcano between the amplitude of the acoustic wave and the vigor of the explosive event both in terms of mass of ejected fragments @xcite and gas volume @xcite .",
