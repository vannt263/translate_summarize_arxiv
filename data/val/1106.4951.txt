    "we note however that there is a lack of experimental and theoretical studies on the possibility of hydrogen - induced magnetic order inside the crystalline structure of pure zno .    in this work",
    "we are interested on dim in zno crystals triggered through the implantation of hydrogen at low energies and its influence on the magnetotransport .",
    "we report on a detailed experimental study that demonstrates how the intentional doping of hydrogen in the percent range and at low - enough energies influences substantially the electrical , magnetic and magnetotransport properties of zno single crystals .",
    "in particular , we show in this report a hydrogen - induced anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) as well as the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) in h - zno single crystals .",
    "therefore , the existence of hydrogen - induced ferromagnetism in h - zno samples is supported not only by the usual magnetization data taken with a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid)@xcite but also from magnetotransport measurements .",

    "the magnetization of the zno single crystals before and after the plasma treatment was determined with a squid .",
    "the magnetotransport measurements were performed in an oxford cryostat with a magnetic field up to 8  t and a rotating sample holder allowing us to measure the resistance at different angles between magnetic field and the input current .",

    "the obtained magnetization values indicate that our h-3 sample , for example , would have a net magnetic moment of 0.2  @xmath8@xmath19 per hydrogen atom .",
    "this estimate is obtained taking into account the amount of h implanted .",
    "the difference between the two estimates may indicate that the assumed ferromagnetic mass is larger than the true one .",
    "this appears plausible because the hydrogen atoms are not necessarily homogeneously distributed inside its penetration depth .",
    "we believe that in the first 20  nm depth we have regions where the magnetic order is less developed and therefore one tends to overestimate the ferromagnetic mass .",

    "the donor energy states can be dispersed into an impurity band because of the coulomb fields arising from the compensating acceptors and ionized donors@xcite .",

    "the resistance of the semiconducting contribution @xmath45 is larger than the resistance @xmath40 , becoming this last the dominant transport mechanism@xcite because the thermal energy is not enough to excite the electrons from the upper impurity band i@xmath21 to the conduction band .",
