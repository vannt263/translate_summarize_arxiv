    "bekenstein - hawking area entropy @xcite , which plays a central role in black hole thermodynamics , has given rise to the speculative idea that no physical degrees of freedom reside within the interior of a black hole .",
    "such an idea is theoretically backed by the fact that neither the gibbons - hawking @xcite euclidean path integral derivation , nor the more locally oriented wald s @xcite derivation , make actually use of the black hole interior .",
    "one may thus conclude that , as far as entropy packing is concerned , the interior of a black hole is apparently superfluous , so that the black hole degrees of freedom , whatever they are , live on or just above the outer horizon .",
    "the deal being one bit of information per a quarter of planck area of the horizon surface @xcite .",
    "the apparent inconsistency between the horizon as a physical entity , the residence @xcite of the black hole degrees of freedom , and as the mere point of no return for all in - falling matter , has ignited a well advertised debate in the physical society .",
    "the black hole area entropy formula has inspired the so - called holographic principle .",
    "the latter asserts that all of information contained in some region of space can be represented as a hologram on the boundary of that region .",
    "it furthermore puts a universal purely geometrical bound , saturated by bekenstein - hawking area entropy , on the amount of entropy stored within that region , namely @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the area of the closed spacial boundary , @xmath2 is newton s constant , and @xmath3 .",
    "the holographic principle , primarily introduced by t hooft @xcite , attempting to resolve the black hole information paradox , has been further developed by susskind @xcite to deal with black hole complementarity , and has eventually acquired a covariant generalization by bousso @xcite .",
    "the holographic principle is recently gaining a major theoretical support from the ads / cft duality @xcite .",
    "it is commonly believed that general relativity is not necessarily the ultimate theory of gravity .",
    "if it is not the fundamental , but rather ( say ) a spontaneously induced theory of gravity , with @xmath4 treated as a vev , the black hole limit has been shown @xcite to be governed by a phase transition which occurs precisely at the would have been event horizon .",
    "recall that the idea of horizon phase transition @xcite is not new ( and in a similar category are black stars @xcite and stringy fuzzballs @xcite ) . whereas the general relativistic exterior black hole solution is fully recovered",
    ", it serendipitously connects now , by means of a smooth self similar transition profile , with a novel holographic core .",
    "this core is characterized , among other things , by a vanishing spatial volume , a crucial feature for black hole physics .",
    "it is in this context of spontaneously induced general relativity that the first local realization of maximal entropy packing has been demonstrated @xcite . to be a bit more specific ,",
    "sticking momentarily to spherical symmetry , it has been shown that associated with any inner sphere of circumferential radius @xmath5 is the total purely geometrical universal entropy @xmath6 which saturates the holographic bound layer by layer .",
    "the accompanying komar mass @xcite , as well as weinberg s material energy @xcite , are notably non - singular , namely @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the overall mass calculated at @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the horizon area .",
    "such a komar mass distribution appears to be intimately related to , and thus as fundamental as , the entropy distribution itself . in addition , the fact that the corresponding invariant spatial volume @xmath11 for every @xmath12 can explain why the black hole entropy , unlike in any other macroscopic system , is not proportional to the volume of the system . rather than envision bits of information",
    "evenly spread on the horizon surface , they may actually inhabit , universally and holographically in an onion - like manner , the entire black hole interior .    in this paper , by providing a holographic interior for the reissner - nordstrom exterior , we extend the davidson - gurwich analysis@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by motivating and then introducing the action which governs the spontaneously induces general relativity , and derive the associated gravitational and scalar field equations ( section ii ) .",
    "these equations do not seem to admit a generic analytical solution , so we start by deriving their asymptotic behavior for the static spherically symmetric case , focusing on the deviation from the reissner - nordstrom background ( section iii ) .",
    "the asymptotic expansion is then used as a boundary condition for numerically plotting the various functions floating around , and to get a first glimpse into the characteristic phase transition which is developed at the would have been black hole horizon ( section iv ) . at this stage",
    ", one can already appreciate the vanishing invariant volume of the novel interior core .",
    "consequently , by systematically getting rid of the negligible terms in the field equations , we derive the approximate analytic solution of the core metric ( section v ) .",
    "the in - out self - similar transition profile is analytically calculated ( section vi ) , allowing us to finally fix the left over parameters of the inner solution by means of the mass @xmath13 and the elecric charge @xmath14 .",
    "various aspects of the inner metric , such as vanishing volume , light cones , kruskal structure , and singularity issues are discussed in section vii .",
    "finally , owing to the recovery of the exact hawking imaginary time periodicity ( by defusing a conic singularity near the origin ) and the emerging of a characteristic non - singular komar mass function ( section viii ) , we re - formulate the holographic entropy packing , emphasizing its universal geometric structure ( section ix ) .",
    "the simplest theory which accounts for the coupling of electromagnetism to spontaneously induced general relativity is given by the action @xmath15 the role of the scalar potential is to allow the conformally coupled brans - dicke @xcite scalar field @xmath16 to develop the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath17 several remarks are in order :    \\(i ) the scalar field is kept electrically neutral , and furthermore does not couple directly to electromagnetism .",
    "this defines the jordan frame , rather than the einstein frame , to be the physical one .",
    "our main conclusions turn out , however , to be frame independent .",
    "\\(ii ) on simplicity grounds , a kinetic scalar term has not been introduced .",
    "this , as we shall see , does not make the scalar field non - dynamical . adding a kinetic term is always a viable option though , with minor effects on the inner metric .",
    "\\(iii ) the specific choice of the double well scalar potential @xmath18 makes the theory fully equivalent to a simple @xmath19 gravity @xcite theory , namely @xmath20 in particular , stability @xmath21 la sotiriou - faraoni @xcite is guaranteed by construction for @xmath22 .",
    "the value of @xmath23 can be made as small as necessary to be compatible with solar system tests .",
    "varying the action eq.([eq : basicaction ] ) with respect to the three dynamical fields @xmath24 leads respectively to the following equations of motion @xmath25 by tracing the gravitational field eqs.([eq : gfieldeq ] ) , and then substituting the resulting ricci scalar into eq.([eq : phifieldeq ] ) , one can extract the associated klein gordon equation @xmath26 the evolution of the scalar field is thus governed by the effective potential @xmath27 the similarity between the two potentials @xmath28 and @xmath29 is not generic .    at this stage ,",
    "our interest lies with the static spherically symmetric case , with the corresponding line element taking the conventional form @xmath30 the only non - vanishing entries of the electromagnetic tensor are @xmath31 first , we solve the associated maxwell equation @xmath32 whose straight forward solution is given by @xmath33 with @xmath14 denoting the electric charge .",
    "next , we substitute eq.([eq : electic - field ] ) into the three independent gravitational and scalar field equations , which can then be reorganized in the master form @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 one can easily verify that associated with the vacuum solution @xmath37 is the reissner nordstrom ( rn ) black hole metric @xmath38 however , unlike in general relativity , the reissner - nordstrom solution , which we hereby tag with some @xmath39 , is now accompanied by a general class of asymptotically flat @xmath40 solutions . in this language ,",
    "our paper is mainly devoted to the unfamiliar physics encountered at the @xmath41 limit .",
    "a general analytic solution of our field equations is still at large .",
    "alternatively , we adopt the strategy to use an asymptotically flat perturbation around the rn solution as a boundary condition for the numerical solution of the field equations . needless to say , the numeric solution by itself is not our final goal , but the resulting graphs will give us the first clue regarding the structure of the phase transition awaiting ahead .",
    "consider thus a perturbative solution of the general form @xmath42 where the constant @xmath43 , which can be interpreted as the scalar charge , serves as our small expansion parameter .",
    "naively , one may expect general relativity to be fully recovered at the limit @xmath44 , but as we are about to see , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "of particular interest for us is the decoupled linear differential equation @xmath45 which quantifies the deviation @xmath46 from general relativity .",
    "unfortunately , even this equation is not that cooperative . at large @xmath5 , however , which is equivalent to neglecting @xmath13 and @xmath14 , one gets rid of the diverging term to stay with the converging yukawa tail @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , once @xmath13 and @xmath14 are re - introduced , we expect the solution to be of the form @xmath48 clearly , the equation for @xmath49 is still quite complicated , but it becomes manageable upon keeping only the leading terms at large @xmath5 , that is @xmath50 the solution of this equation involves the hypergeometric and the so - called meijerg functions .",
    "it so happens , however , that both these functions exhibit identical divergent behavior . in turn",
    ", one can always find a converging linear combination , with the latter being proportional to @xmath51 . to be more specific , @xmath52    with this in hands",
    ", we proceed to the linear differential equation for @xmath53 , namely @xmath54 the solution of this equation is a sum of several gamma functions which , at the large @xmath5 limit , is well approximated by the expression @xmath55 by the same token , one can also calculate @xmath56",
    "on pedagogical grounds , to have a glimpse at the new physics offered by spontaneously induced general relativity , we first plot numerical graphs of the various functions involved .",
    "starting at some large enough distance @xmath57 where the reissner nordstrom metric components and the inverse newton constant are supplemented by the perturbations eqs.([phi1],[l1],[n1 ] ) , we run a full numerical calculation which produces figs.([fig1],[fig2],[fig3 ] ) , respectively .",
    "we do it for a positive scalar charge @xmath58 , and focus our attention on the limit @xmath59 .",

    "this new interior solution differs conceptually from the reissner nordstrom interior by three characteristic features , namely    1 .",
    "no @xmath62 signature flip , 2 .",
    "drastically suppressed @xmath63 , and 3 .   locally varying effective newton constant .",
    "following the preliminary numerical insight , we now proceed to uncover the geometry / physics of the inner core , and reveal the analytic structure of the phase transition profile .",
    "the key feature now is the fact that @xmath64 in the entire inner core .",
    "a closer numerical inspection reveals that all terms in the field equations eqs.([eq : fieldeqi],[eq : fieldeqiii],[eq : fieldeqii ] ) which are proportional to @xmath65 are practically negligible relative to the other terms . in particular ,",
    "the negligible pieces include the scalar potential terms and the electromagnetic energy momentum contributions , thereby indicating a universal inner structure .",
    "the field equations take then the slimmer form @xmath66 strictly for the current approximation @xmath67 , but by introducing @xmath68 we reserve the option of searching for the roots of the transition profile already within the @xmath69 framework which corresponds to plain ( insensitive to the scalar potential ) @xmath70 gravity . switching @xmath68 off and on",

    "altogether , in analogy with eq.([deltasmarrh ] ) , and subject to the geometric rule eq.([delta ] ) , we have @xmath202     configuration ( solid circles ) is a linearly stretched version of the @xmath184 configuration ( dashed circles ) . as @xmath199 , each point at a circumferential radius @xmath5",
    "gets radially shifted by an amount @xmath203 . ]",
    "the emerging entropy packing profile turns out to be ( i ) locally holographic , i.e. exhibits proportionality to @xmath204 for every @xmath12 , and ( ii ) @xmath198-independent , and hence universal .",
    "the overall picture is then of an onion - like entropy packing model @xcite .",
    "the entropy of any inner sphere is maximally packed , and unaffected by the outer layers . in particular , any additional piece of entropy is maximally packed on its own external layer , with @xmath198 as well as @xmath205 being adjusted accordingly .    an interesting point has to do with the entropy to energy ratio , which is @xmath5-independent in our case , but is never smaller than @xmath206",
    "@xmath207 this is in apparent violation of bekenstein s universal entropy bound @xcite .",
    "the reason seems to be the following . whereas the entropy @xmath190 of some inner sphere is universal , the associated komar mass @xmath208 is affected by the total mass @xmath13 of the whole system .",
    "admittedly , bekenstein s universal bound is relevant @xcite only for weakly self gravitating isolated physical systems , and for these it is a much stronger bound than the holographic one .",
    "the various scalings involved may suggest that the holographic entropy packing is indeed a matter of interpretation . to be more explicit ,",
    "let us examine the issue from the point of view of a physicist who is convinced that general relativity is the fundamental theory of gravity , and therefore is totally unaware of its hereby advocated spontaneously induced nature .",
    "such a physicist ( not to be confused with an einstein frame observer whose metric is @xmath209 rather the @xmath210 ) would recast the underlying field equations into their basic einstein form @xmath211 , moving all terms and factors , save for the einstein tensor itself , to the r.h.s . , thereby defining an effective energy / momentum tensor @xmath212 . in particular , inside the core , the dynamical newton constant",
    "is given by @xmath213 but our general relativistic observer still insists on it being @xmath2 , which requires from his side the effective replacement @xmath214 the hawking temperature , on the other hand , is defined at asymptotic distances , and thus , is fully respected by our naive observer , that is @xmath215 but this can not be the case , unless of course @xmath216 in turn , fully consistent with our analysis , the following counter replacements are in order @xmath217 all the above nicely converge now back into @xmath218 which completes the interpretation of an observer ignorant of the local variations of the newton constant inside the core .",
    "it has come as a big surprise that spontaneously induced general relativity does not always admit a full general relativistic limit .",
    "such an intriguing possibility is demonstrated in this paper at the charged black hole level , where the exterior general relativistic reissner - nordstrom solution connects with a novel holographic interior ; the phase transition takes then place precisely at the would have been outer event horizon .",
    "the new physics associated with the inner core has been discussed in some details , with our main result being the local realization of the t hooft - susskind - bousso holographic principle ( the holographic bound , as we recall , is not applicable inside ordinary black holes ) .",
    "notably , this is achieved without invoking string theory and/or the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "our results are not sensitive to the exact shape of the scalar potential , thus leaving the door open a more general class of @xmath19 gravity models , and will only suffer minor modifications upon introducing an optional brans - dicke kinetic term .",
    "the emerging maximal entropy packing mechanism sheds new light on how information is stored within a black hole .",
    "the interior core , resembling now a maximally stretched horizon , is not a boring place any more ( at least in the sense discussed in the introduction ) , but has started functioning as nature s ultimate information storage . rather than envision bits of information evenly spread solely on the horizon surface or in its vicinity , a bit per planck area",
    ", they are now universally and holographically spread in the whole black hole interior . rather than tiling the horizon by planck area patches , the traditional way it is being done in quantum black hole models , the present work suggests the alternative of filling up the interior with ( say ) light sheet unit intervals .",
    "the overall picture is then of an onion - like entropy packing shell model .",
    "reflecting our main formula eq.([universals ] ) , the entropy of any inner sphere , being geometric in nature , is maximally packed and unaffected by the outer layers .",
    "any additional entropy is maximally packed on its own external layer , with the overall mass and charge , as well as the intimately related komar mass distribution eq.([komarcore ] ) , being adjusted accordingly .",
    "needless to say , exactly the same structure is expected to hold once the cosmological constant and/or angular momentum enter the game .    a final speculation concerning the value of @xmath78 , the dimensionless number which parametrizes the deviation from general relativity , is irresistible .",
    "classically , with general relativity so well established , @xmath116 is indeed the limit to study .",
    "however , having quantum mechanics in mind , and appreciating the fact that the singularity at the origin will eventually be disarmed quantum mechanically , it is quite appealing to imagine a very small yet a finite @xmath78 .",
    "for example , the invariant width of the transition region may be fixed by the planck length , namely @xmath219    s.w .",
