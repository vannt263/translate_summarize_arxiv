    "whatever method is used to calculate the finite - temperature properties of the model , these should be used to refine the effective interactions by comparison with the available experiments , or by obtaining additional experimental data for such comparison .",
    "+ steps 4 and 5 should be iterated until satisfactory agreement between model and experiment is achieved .",
    "one of the main reasons for the rapid expansion in theoretical surface science over the last three decades is the development of numerical methods that allow nonperturbative calculations of thermal and structural properties of statistical - mechanical systems .",
    "two such methods , which are particularly well suited to the study of lattice - gas models , are monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and numerical transfer - matrix ( tm ) calculations @xcite . in combination with finite - size scaling analysis of phase - transition phenomena @xcite ,",
    "these methods have contributed significantly to the theoretical understanding of fluctuations and ordering at surfaces and interfaces .",
    "the reason for our emphasis on non - perturbative numerical methods is that they are much more accurate for two - dimensional systems than even quite sophisticated mean - field approximations @xcite , yet they are quite easy to program .",
    "moreover , with modern computer technology their implementation is well within the resources of most researchers .    at present , a large number of monographs and textbooks exist that describe mc methods in great detail @xcite .",
    "we therefore limit ourselves to pointing out that these methods can produce thermodynamic and structural information for a variety of systems , with a very modest amount of programming and with computational resource needs that are readily met by modern workstations .",
    "for example , all the mc results presented here were obtained on workstations . for studies of real systems ,",
    "mc models have the advantage that programs are relatively easy to modify to accommodate changes in lattice structure and/or interaction geometries and ranges .    despite their power and beauty , tm methods are much less known outside the statistical - mechanics community .",
    "however , good reviews are available @xcite , and simple textbook expositions for the one - dimensional case are quite illustrative @xcite .",
    "an abundance of details are scattered throughout the technical literature and can be found , together with further references in _ e.g._refs .",
    "briefly , the method allows the numerical calculation of free energies ( an advantage over mc , which does not easily produce entropies ) , thermodynamic densities , and their associated response functions from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix of boltzmann factors , called the transfer matrix .",
    "in addition to the ability to easily calculate free energies , the method has the further advantage over mc that the results are obtained without statistical errors .",
    "the main disadvantages , relative to mc , are the limited system sizes and interaction ranges that can be attained .",
    "the first problem can relatively easily be overcome with finite - size scaling .",
    "the second , however , severely restricts the applicability of tm methods to realistic electrochemical systems .",
    "depending on the relative interaction ranges and strengths , the lattice - gas models discussed in sec .",
    "[ secmod ] allow many topologically different adsorbate phase diagrams . the specific coadsorption phenomena , such as poisoning @xcite or enhanced adsorption @xcite , which occur for any particular set of interactions , depend crucially on the detailed topology of the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the terms `` poisoning '' and `` enhancement '' can be defined as follows .",
    "+ _ poisoning of a by b : _ when @xmath41 is increased at constant @xmath42 , the total coverage , @xmath43 , goes through a minimum as @xmath44 decreases sharply with only a small corresponding increase in @xmath45 .",
    "+ _ enhancement of a by b : _ @xmath44 goes through a maximum as @xmath41 is increased at constant @xmath42 . for large @xmath41 ,",
    "the enhancement gives way to substitutional desorption , each adsorbed b particle replacing one or more a particles .",
    "for both poisoning and enhancement , a measure of the modification strength is the differential coadsorption ratio , @xmath46 .",
    "the modification is characterized as _ strong _ if @xmath47 , the lattice coordination number . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was discussed in detail how the modification strength is related to the interaction constants for specific , triangular lattice - gas models through the shape of the adsorbate phase diagram . from the standpoint of statistical mechanics , strong modification results from fluctuations typical of the region near a line of critical end points , which joins a surface of discontinuous phase transitions to one of continuous transitions .",
    "more intuitively , these fluctuations can be described as follows . for poisoning , they correspond to an almost bare surface , from which the a particles are repelled by a very small coverage of repulsively interacting b particles @xcite . in the case of enhanced adsorption , the corresponding picture is that of a surface almost fully covered by a monolayer of a particles , which is `` pinned down '' by a low concentration of attractively interacting b particles @xcite .",
    "these considerations lead to inequalities that must be obeyed by the interaction constants , in order for the system to exhibit either poisoning or enhancement of various strengths .",
    "the inequalities are illustrated in fig .  1 of ref",
    ".  @xcite for triangular models with nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "an example of poisoning is provided by the model for the coadsorption of sulfur and hydrogen on pt(111 ) in acid aqueous environment , studied by rikvold and coworkers @xcite . in this case",
    ", the effective nearest - neighbor lateral interactions were obtained from experimental thermodynamic and scattering data .",
    "the numerical adsorption isotherms ( obtained by both mc and tm methods ) gave maximum desorption ratios d@xmath48d@xmath49 , in favorable agreement with experiments @xcite .",
    "it was argued that the general shape of the phase diagram for this model is characteristic of strong poisoning behavior @xcite .",
    "an application of lattice - gas models to study enhanced adsorption was given by rikvold and deakin @xcite , who analyzed experimental data for the electrosorption of organics on metal electrodes : naphthalene on copper @xcite and n - decylamine on nickel @xcite .",
    "they followed a suggestion by damaskin _",
    "_ @xcite that the potential dependence of adsorption of organics on metals can be attributed to the influence of coadsorbed hydrogen .",
    "although the experimental results concerned rough , polycrystalline electrodes , a simple nearest - neighbor model on a triangular lattice was used , aiming merely for semiquantitative agreement .",
    "the effective electrovalences were taken as @xmath50=+1 and @xmath51=0 , and the three effective interaction constants , @xmath52 , together with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , were determined by nonlinear least - squares fits of numerical coadsorption isotherms obtained from a tm calculation to the experimental data .",
    "the experimental and fitted numerical adsorption isotherms for naphthalene on copper are shown in fig .",
    "[ fignaph ] .",
    "the maxima are due to the formation of a mixed naphthalene / hydrogen adsorbed phase in the potential region between @xmath551000 and @xmath55800 mv versus the normal hydrogen electrode ( nhe ) .",
    "the fitted lattice - gas interactions are consistent with independent estimates @xcite , as discussed in detail in ref .",
    "a major source of uncertainty in the applications of simple lattice - gas models to the experimental results discussed in the previous section , is the poor characterization of the electrode surfaces .",
    "to remedy this situation , wieckowski and rikvold with collaborators have undertaken a series of studies of the electrosorption of small molecules and ions on well - characterized single - crystal surfaces .",
    "a characteristic aspect of these systems is the high specificity of the adsorption phenomena with respect to the structures of the substrate lattice and the main adsorbate .",
    "a good geometric fit promotes the formation of ordered adsorbate phases commensurate with the substrate , which can be observed both by _ in situ_atomic - scale spectroscopies and by _",
    "ex situ_scattering techniques .",
    "the detailed experimental results that can be extracted from such systems merit the construction of more complicated models with longer - ranged and multi - particle interactions .    by way of examples we discuss two specific single - crystal adsorption systems : the electrosorption of urea on pt(100 ) from an acid electrolyte @xcite and the upd of copper on au(111 ) from a sulfate - containing electrolyte . both systems exhibit a dramatic peak sharpening in the cyclic voltammogram ( cv ) , from several hundred  mv to on the order of 10@xmath56mv when a small concentration of the adsorbate species ( urea , or a mixture of sulfate and copper ions , respectively ) is added to the supporting electrolyte .",
    "this effect is also exhibited by other systems , such as sulfuric acid on rh(111 ) @xcite .",
    "whereas the urea / pt(100 ) system develops only a single , sharp cv peak @xcite , in the case of copper upd , two peaks , approximately 100  mv apart , are exhibited @xcite .",
    "we associate these effects with phase transitions in the layer of contact adsorbed particles .",
    "these transitions involve the replacement of a monolayer of adsorbed hydrogen or copper on the negative - potential side of the cv peaks by ordered submonolayers at more positive potentials .",
    "the observed voltammetric changes are much weaker or absent when the same substances are adsorbed onto other crystal planes of the same metals @xcite .",
    "the high specificity with respect to the adsorbent surface structure indicates that the effects depend crucially on the geometric fit between ( at least one of ) the adsorbate species and the surface .",
    "this observation was used in developing the specific lattice - gas models .",
    "in addition to the surface - specific narrowing of the cv peak upon the addition of urea to the supporting electrolyte , the experimental observations to which the model was fitted are as follows .",

    "the urea coverage @xmath57 , measured _ in situ _ by a radiochemical method ( rcm ) , changes over a potential range of approximately 20@xmath56mv around the cv peak position from near zero on the negative side to approximately 1/4 monolayers ( ml ) on the positive side .",
    "ex situ _ auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) studies are consistent with the rcm results .",

    "+ the lattice - gas model developed to account for these observations was based on the assumption that urea [ co(nh@xmath59 coordinates the platinum through its nitrogen atoms ( or nh@xmath60 groups ) , with the c = o group pointing away from the surface . since the unstrained n - n distance in urea matches the lattice constant of the square pt(100 ) surface quite well ( 2.33   @xcite versus 2.77   @xcite ) , it was assumed that urea occupies two adsorption sites on the square pt(100 ) lattice .",
    "integration of the cv profiles indicates that the hydrogen saturation coverage in the negative - potential region corresponds to one elementary charge per pt(100 ) unit cell , and that most of the surface hydrogen is desorbed in the same potential range where urea becomes adsorbed .",
    "therefore , it was assumed @xcite that hydrogen adsorbs in the same on - top positions as the urea nitrogen atoms .",
    "this assumption was recently strengthened by visible - infrared sum generation spectroscopy observations @xcite .",
    "the resulting model @xcite is a dimer - monomer model in which hydrogen is adsorbed at the nodes and urea on the bonds of a square lattice representing the pt(100 ) surface .",

    "the corresponding code is rather slow in terms of machine time per mc step .",
    "however , the additional transitions allowed by these clusters , relative to minimal clusters consisting of two nodes and their connecting bond , include `` diffusion - like '' moves in which the urea molecules can go from one bond to another and the hydrogen atoms from one node to another , without changing the local coverages within the cluster .",
    "these moves significantly reduce the free - energy barriers that must be surmounted in order to locally minimize the adsorbate free energy , and they dramatically reduce the number of mc steps per site ( mcss ) necessary for the system to reach thermodynamic equilibrium . for this system , simulated `` leed patterns '' were obtained as the squared fourier transform of the adsorbed urea configurations .",
    "these were obtained by the fast fourier transform algorithm and averaged in the same way as the thermodynamic quantities @xcite .    since the number of model parameters is large , the numerical calculations are time consuming , and the experimental data concern a number of different quantities , parameter estimation by a formal optimization procedure was not a practical alternative for this study .",

    "the method is well suited to describe ordering and fluctuation effects in the contact - adsorbed layer , which are strongly influenced by effective , lateral interactions .",
    "phenomena that can be described include poisoning and enhancement effects , and concrete examples were given for several systems of experimental interest .",
    "the effective interactions arise from a number of different sources , including mediation through the substrate electrons , through phonons , and through the fluid near the surface , and their calculation from first principles is not yet feasible in general .",
    "the alternative route advocated here provides a microscopic picture of the adsorbate structure , as well as a procedure for estimating approximate effective interaction energies from experimentally observed structural and thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the resulting models have considerable predictive power regarding the dependences of observed thermodynamic quantities on the electrochemical potential and the bulk solute concentrations , as well as on the geometric structure of the substrate and the adsorbates . since the methods discussed are simple to program and not particularly computationally intensive , they are well suited for experimental data analysis .",
