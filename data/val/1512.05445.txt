    "for a study of the asymptotic behavior of solutions of a system , the area of dynamical systems has developed a lot of tools , but in many phenomena as financial markets , equations that model them are unknown and the only available information is a temporal set of measures .    a time series is a function @xmath0 , and its image could be considered as observations taken overtime in a particular phenomenon .",
    "those pieces of observations have information about the system and we are ready to answer questions like does that serie have enough information to rebuild the dynamics ? if it is so , can we predestine its future behaviour ? .",
    "but there is one more general question .",
    "will the financial market have a random behaviour or not ? .",
    "the chaos theory could give us an answer where systems with an apparently ramdom behaviour , comes from a deterministic system , it means a completely modeling system by equations .",
    "chaotic system complexity lies primarily in sensitivity to initial conditions , small variations produce big changes.this sensitivity is quatified by lyapunov exponents .",
    "we will do our research in a time series of the stock prices in the mining company minsur.sa to determine concrete evidence of chaos presence in that series .",
    "graphic([fig1 ] ) shows evolution of stock prices of the company .",
    "to show the use of chaos theory in time series , we consider the lorenz system , which is given by : @xmath1 the dynamics of system solutions is shown in the figure([fig2 ] )        it is well known lorenz system is sensitive to small variations with initial data , it means , solutions with very close initial data is not exact exponentially@xcite .",
    "figure([fig3 ] ) shows such a behaviour in the first component of solutions for very close data initial .",
    "the series in the figure([fig3 ] ) were generated with initial data in points @xmath2 and @xmath3 in time with variation in mili seconds .",
    "notice the trajectories differ after 3 seconds , it means , small variations generate big changes quickly .",
    "so that , chaos theory could explain some phenomena in the financial market , where variations like speculations generate changes in a short term .",
    "one of the goals in this work is to investigate chaotic behavior on time series in the financial market precisely applied in the peruvian financial system        the main task to study the chaotic behavior in a time series is the rebuilding of the dynamics it has .",
    "if a time series comes from a deterministic system , so that it has dependence between its components given by the system of equations that modeling and contains geometric information considering that trajectories converge to an attractor which will be inmerse in some euclidian space . using such information and the whitney immersion theorem ideas in which a dimensional compact manifold @xmath4 can be inmersed in @xmath5 and its generalizations for fractal sets given for tim sauer@xcite , we will rebuild the dynamics knowing the information of one of the components of lorenz system only .",
    "now we can see the probabilistic version of theorem of withney@xcite",
    "[ preva](prevalent theorem of whitney ) if @xmath6 is a smooth compact manifold of dimension @xmath7 contained on @xmath8 .",
    "almost all smooth map , @xmath9 , is an immersion of @xmath6 .",
    "the theorem([preva ] ) says it is possible to rebuild the existing dynamics with projections in euclidian spaces .",
    "despite we have the theorem of whitney , we still have a practical problem .",
    "we only can get a temporal observation of the dynamics in the financial market , the evolution of the stock prices and we will need @xmath10 1observations of the phenomenon .",
    "so , the obtained results are not enough .",
    "takens assumed this problem adding the contained dynamics in the time series in the theorem of whitney .",
    "it is a projection via a function of observation of the phase space where the dynamical system is developed for @xmath11 .",
    "therefore it contains information about the dynamics . for this",
    ", it defines the _ delay cordinates _ , which only need a temporary observation .",
    "[ delacor ] if @xmath12 is a dynamics system over a manifold @xmath6 , @xmath13 a positive integer ( called of * _ delay _ * ) , and @xmath14 a smoth function .",
    "we defines the map of delaying coordinates @xmath15 @xmath16    taken@xcite demonstrated a new version of theorem of whitney for the delaying coordinates    ( takens ) @xmath6 is a dimensional compact manifold @xmath17 , @xmath18 a discrete dynamical system over @xmath6 generated by @xmath19 , and a function of classe @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "is a generic characteristic that of map @xmath22 defined by @xmath23 is an immersion .",
    "the final generalization used in this article was given by b.hunt , t. sauer and j. yorke@xcite , that is a fractal version of theorem of whitney for the delaying maps set with @xmath6 being a fractal set .",
    "[ delafraw](fractal delay embedding prevalence theorem ) @xmath12 a dynamics system over an open subset @xmath24 of @xmath8 , and @xmath6 a compact subset of @xmath24 with box dimension @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath25 an integer and @xmath26 .",
    "asume that @xmath6 contains only a finite number of equilibrio points , it does not contains periodic orbits of @xmath12 of period @xmath13 o @xmath27 , a finit number of periodic orbits of @xmath12 of period @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and these periodic orbits linearizations have different eigenvalues .",
    "so for almost every smooth function(in the sense prevalente ) smooth function @xmath30 over @xmath24 , the delay coordinates map @xmath31 is injective over @xmath6    the theorem([delafraw ] ) does not provide an estimative about the smaller dimension for which almost every delaying coordinates map is injective .",
    "however there are numerical algorithms which allow calculate the immersion dimension and the delaying time in the reconstruction.following , we show the reconstruction of the dynamics generated for the system of lorenz using only the coordinate @xmath32 of the system",
    "we use the lorenz s attractor to show the technique of delaying coordinates .",
    "the function of observation @xmath30 , was the projection in the @xmath32 axis .",
    "@xmath33 the time series will be formed by @xmath32 coordinates of the trajectories that are numerical solutions of the equation . fixed the dimension , @xmath34",
    ", we change the value of t @xmath13 . according to lorenz s we use delaying times , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 . in the case",
    "@xmath35 points in the space are highly correlated and the graphic is almost a straight line . at the other extreme , @xmath38 ,",
    "points are not correlated and the gotten graphic does not represent the reconstruction of the attractor .",
    "the optimal delay time was @xmath37 .             +            to determine the dimension where is rebuilt the dynamics , the technique of the neighbours is used",
    "the idea is about setting a dimension and calculate the distance between close points , if the attractor does not have enough freedom , so when we raise the dimension of the space , those next points get separeted and are pointed as false neighbours .",
    "the procedure goes on until the percentage of false neighbours is small . in the series formed with the first components of lorenz s system ,",
    "the number of false neighbours is almost zero when the dimension of immersion is @xmath39 , figure([fig10 ] ) .",
    "first of all , we will give the definition of chaos according to devaney@xcite .",
    "[ defcaos ] if @xmath40 is an interval .",

    "we are interested in searching the characteristic @xmath54 which is characterized by lyapunov exponents .",
    "it is important to know lineal systems can not be chaotic .",
    "we will identify no lineal dependences on data .",
    "the most used techniques are : method of surrogates data and the test bds .",
    "+ kantz e schreiber@xcite recommend that before doing any non lineal analysis on a data set , it is good practice to check if there is no linearity .",
    "because the linear systems are not chaotic and the linear stochastic processes can produce very complex series which can be misunderstood as a product of chaotic system .",
    "we presented the technique of surrogate data and the bds test .",
    "a very useful technique used by physicist is surrogate generation of _ surrogate data _ , a procedure done by theiler , eubank , longtin , galdrikan y farmer@xcite .",
    "from the original data , it generates a set of random series so that , these keep the linear properties of the original series ( average , variance , fourier spectrum ) but eliminating the possible nonlinear dependencies.then an indicator is evaluated , which is sensitive to nonlinear dependencies and try to reject the null hypothesis , which states that data are obtained by a stochastic linear process . if the null hypothesis is true , then the substitute series procedure would not affect the indicator    the most used indicators are correlation dimension .",
    "it was used by small et .",
    "al.@xcite and no linear prediction which was used by kaplan@xcite .",
    "we will illustrate the technique of substitute data applied in lorenz series and use the nonlinear prediction .",
    "the election was due to deterministic systems the prediction on a short term is possible , in contrast to stochastic systems in which the prediction in a short term is impossible . for the prediction nonlinear we will use the method developed by hegger , kantz and schreiber@xcite , where the value of predicting is the average of `` future '' values .",
    "this state @xmath55 , is defined by average of the closed values .",
    "it is calculated by the following equation @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the neighborhood , @xmath58 are values within @xmath57 and @xmath59 are the values at time @xmath55 .",
    "held the prediction , this is compared with the quadratic average error of prediction on future value of the original serie with the surrogate series .",
    "if the prediction error of the series original is smaller than all the surrogate series , then we reject the null hypothesis .",
    "this graphic shows the results .",
    "the projection errors of the original series were smaller than its substitutes . like this , we reject the null hypothesis .    the following technique is more about statistics .",
    "it was developed by brock , dechert and scheinkman@xcite , it s based on the correlation dimension to detect nonlinear structure in a time series .",
    "additionally this test can be used to test how good is the fit estimation model    given a time series @xmath60 , using the method of delay coordinates , we have @xmath61 vectors in @xmath62 , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the delay time , @xmath17 is the immersion dimensin .",

    "now if @xmath70 we will get @xmath71 then , @xmath72 implies @xmath73 and @xmath74",

    "contractions allow the pathlines may not move away indefinitely and that they remain confined to a bounded phase space region .",
    "distance speed is measured by the lyapunov exponents .    in the case of a discrete dynamic defined by a map system @xmath110",
    ", @xmath111 is the jacobian matrix of @xmath42 .",
    "then writing @xmath112 the largest lyapunov exponent is given by : @xmath113    for almost all vector @xmath114 , for more details see@xcite .",
    "as we can see the first problem for the calculation of lyapunov exponents is to obtain the matrizes @xmath115 . in the case of having only a time series",
    "the calculation of lyapunov exponent is even more complicated .",
    "ruelle@xcite,@xcite proposed the first algorithms based on the following ideas .",

    "another factor to consider is that the lyapunov exponents are defined in terms of limits , which guarantees its invariance by smooth transformations .",

    "are generated series substitute which preserve linear properties of the original series , for example , the graph([surrohistpet ] ) shows histograms of the original series as well as his surrogate series .",
    "[ surrohistpet ]     the next step is the calculation of the predictions of each of the series , original and substitute , and comparing related errors .",
    "the figure([surropredictpet ] ) shows that errors of prediction of the original series presents a relatively small short - term prediction error and substitute series shows a high prediction error from the first moment .",
    "therefore the null(@xmath137 : error of the original series prediction = surrogate series prediction error)hypothesis is rejected since the original series prediction error is less than all their substitute series prediction error .",
