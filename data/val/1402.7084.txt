    "in the broad field of nonequilibrium quantum physics , the unitary evolution of isolated systems after an instantaneous perturbation ( quench ) has become a prominent subject  @xcite .",
    "the enthusiasm is in part due to the development of computational methods to study strongly correlated quantum systems , such as density matrix renormalization group @xcite and numerical linked - cluster expansions @xcite , and to ongoing experiments with nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite and with cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the high level of control and quasi - isolation allow for the experimental analysis of coherent evolutions for very long - times .",
    "the studies of quench dynamics often distinguish global from local perturbations .",
    "what is referred to as one or the other presupposes a choice of basis representation .",
    "local quenches in space have been addressed in  @xcite .",
    "the experiment in  @xcite analyzes the quantum dynamics of an excitation created by flipping a single spin in the middle of a heisenberg chain .",
    "the case where two semi - infinite lines are joined at their endpoints and subsequently evolved as a single infinite system has received special attention , because of the possibility of achieving exact results using conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "other theoretical studies include the quench of a local magnetic field applied to few sites of a heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain  @xcite and a time dependent local quench of the transverse field in the ising chain  @xcite .",
    "the general expectation is that the effects of local quenches be more limited than those of global quenches  @xcite .    here",
    ", we show that for the systems and initial states considered , local and global quenches in space may in fact lead to equivalent outcomes .",
    "the local quench that we investigate is similar to the one treated in  @xcite .",
    "the system is initially in an eigenstate of an initial hamiltonian @xmath1 that describes an integrable clean anisotropic heisenberg spin-@xmath0 chain with only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) couplings , the so - called @xmath2 model .",
    "we quench the amplitude of a magnetic field applied to a _ single site _ from zero to a finite value , creating an on - site defect ( impurity ) .",
    "the consequences of such , at first sight , minor perturbation are drastic .",
    "the interplay between the defect and the interactions of the @xmath2 model takes the system into the chaotic domain  @xcite .",
    "this reminds one of the sinai s billiards , where the square table becomes chaotic due to a circular obstacle of arbitrarily small radius placed at its center  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that the local quench of the magnetic field is comparable to a global quench where couplings between next - nearest neighbors ( nnn ) are suddenly included in the clean @xmath2 model .",
    "the frustrated heisenberg spin-@xmath0 hamiltonian that emerges with the addition of nnn terms is also chaotic .",
    "depending on the amplitude of the on - site static field and on the ratio between nnn and nn couplings , both final hamiltonians @xmath3 , for the impurity and frustrated chains , look alike when written in the basis coinciding with the eigenstates of @xmath1 . from this correspondence ,",

    "our local and global quenches coincide in the limit of intermediate perturbation . in this scenario ,",
    "the energy distributions of the initial states have a breit - wigner ( lorentzian ) shape  @xcite , which leads to the exponential decay of the fidelity mentioned above . by further increasing the ratio between nnn and nn couplings",
    ", the frustrated system eventually reaches the strong perturbation regime . at this point ,",
    "the initial states approach the maximum possible level of delocalization available to a system with two - body interactions , their energy distributions achieving a gaussian form and the fidelity decay becoming gaussian  @xcite .",
