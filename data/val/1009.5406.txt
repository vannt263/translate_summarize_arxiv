    "first applications of quantum groups and noncommutative geometry to model quantum gravity effects have been around for some 2 decades now@xcite .",
    "the work @xcite proposed how noncommutative spacetime might tame infinities in physics while in 1994 we introduced the particular bicrossproduct or @xmath0-minkowski spacetime @xcite which has since attracted a fair amount of attention , mainly because it ` almost commutative ' and hence easier to work with . in this model",
    "the spatial generators @xmath7 mutually commute but the time variable @xmath8 does not .",
    "rather , @xmath9=\\imath\\lambda_p x_i\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a real parameter . if the noncommutative geometry arises as a model of quantum gravity corrections to classical geometry then presumably @xmath10 as planck time .",
    "the model has a bicrossproduct form of quantum poincar group and section  2 provided a little more background to its construction .    in spite of its success , which includes the proposal of its testing by time of flight data being collected for gamma - ray bursts by fermi - glast currently in orbit ,",
    "the main criticism of the bicrossproduct model remains that it is rather special to flat spacetime , relying as it does on ( quantum group ) fourier transform and plane waves@xcite .",
    "this does not sit too well as a quantum gravity effect as it effectively applies in some weak field limit .",
    "in @xcite we have proposed an answer to this criticism ; a general construction of a noncommutative spacetime @xmath11 in which space is now any classical riemannian 3-manifold @xmath12 equipped with a conformal killing vector field @xmath13 and a static metric of classical form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a function on @xmath16 . in our new theory",
    "the noncommutative differential geometry replaces the quantum poincar group as the guiding force , though the latter would be expected in the fullness of time to reemerge as the fiber of an associated affine quantum group frame bundle using the formalism of @xcite .",
    "in fact the noncommutative geometry does not contain a full development of the noncommuative metric and noncommutative riemannian geometry , although again this should emerge in the fullness of time .",
    "rather , it takes a shortcut straight to the physically important noncommutative spacetime wave operator .",
    "this theory constructs the noncommutative wave - operator on @xmath11 viewed as quantizing any static spacetime .",
    "this includes the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "however , computations are quite formidable and hence in practice we work with a simplified version in which we use the flat bicrossproduct model spacetime ( [ bicxt ] ) but ` bolt on ' the nontrivial riemannian 3-geometry by a process of minimal coupling .",
    "this allows us to treat the black hole using the flat spacetime bicrossproduct model as the ambient noncommutative space .",
    "the derivation in @xcite is outlined briefly in section  3 to the point of the noncommutative wave equation ( [ bhwave2 ] ) .",
    "the present paper studies the black hole noncommutative wave operator in a certain scaling limit where distance @xmath17 in planck lengths from the event horizon is maintained while at the same time sending @xmath1 .",
    "this leads to a classical and much more amenable wave equation @xmath18 where the parameter @xmath6 is the schwarzschild frequency .",
    "this still retains quantum gravity effects and has the same qualitative behaviour around the horizon as the original theory in @xcite .",
    "our findings are summarized at the end of the paper , see figure  3 .",
    "the physical significance of the novel ` noncommutative skin ' layer at the event horizon remains more fully to be understood .",
    "it is perfectly possible to read the paper starting at the scaling limit wave equation ( [ bhwave3 ] ) .",
    "we first explain some of the background to the model .",
    "indeed , quantum groups arose out of physics in two different classes .",
    "the first and most well known are the drinfeld - jimbo quantum groups @xmath19 associated to complex semisimple lie algebras @xmath20 and coming out of integrable systems . professor jimbo at this conference rightly obtained the weyl prize in part for that .",
    "the other less well - known class are the ` bicrossproduct ' quantum groups introduced by the author as associated to lie group factorisations and coming out of ideas for quantum gravity and planck scale physics@xcite . at the time planck scale physics",
    "was considered unreachable by experiment but in recent years this view has changed and these bicrossproduct quantum groups have gained in interest particularly as deformations of poincar and other inhomogenenous non - simple groups .",
    "the general construction here has semidirect product form @xmath21 where @xmath16 is a lie group on which a lie algebra @xmath20 acts and where @xmath16 acts back on @xmath22 and on the set of its associated group @xmath23 so as to form a ` matched pair ' .",
    "the latter ` back - reaction ' induces a semdirect coproduct or , equivalently , a dual quantum group @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the lie algebra of @xmath16 , making everything symmetric between the two factors .",
    "there is also a canonical action of the first quantum group on @xmath26 and its of dual on @xmath27 , which are therefore naturally arising noncommative geometries with these quantum groups as symmetries .",
    "such data arise from the local factorisation of any group @xmath28 into @xmath29 where neither subgroup need be normal , a very common occurrence in mathematics and physics .    as well as the general construction , including specifics for the iwasawa factorisation , my 1988 phd thesis explicitly covered@xcite the case @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a curved ( nonabelian ) version of @xmath32 .",
    "its lie algebra @xmath33 has relations ( [ bicxt ] ) for @xmath34 , @xmath35 providing a noncommutative space on which the bicrossproduct quantum group @xmath36 acts .",
    "the 4d case studied a bit later in @xcite is similarly based on @xmath37 where the lie algebra @xmath38 again has the relations ( [ bicxt ] ) but with @xmath39 .",
    "the associated bicrossproduct quantum poincar group @xmath40 was shown to be isomorphic as an abstract hopf algebra to a ` @xmath0-poincar quantum group ' obtained by contraction of @xmath41 in @xcite but had a different and inequivalent interpretation of the generators and therefore should not be confused with that .",
    "moreover , the bicrossproduct model not only provided the correct interpretation of the hopf algebra but provided the quantum spacetime ( [ bicxt ] ) on which it acts as the enveloping algebra @xmath42 .",
    "this is the bicrossproduct spacetime or ` @xmath0-minkowski ' model introduced by the author and h. ruegg@xcite .",
    "since then , the bicrossproduct model quantum spacetime has attracted a great deal of attention , not least due to its testable variable speed of light prediction@xcite .",
    "that there might be such a prediction had been hoped for on the basis that the deformed relations of the bicrossproduct poincar algebra involve a deformed form of the casimir , but this of itself has no meaning as one can just rename the generators ; merely calling a generator @xmath43 or @xmath44 does not make it energy or momentum . however , such speculations were turned into an actual prediction in @xcite by analysing the associated wave operator on noncommutative spacetime and its action on noncommutative plane waves @xmath45 .",
    "we made the reasonable assumption that physical plane waves would , in this model of quantum gravity effects , be identified with these normal ordered mathematical plane waves .",
    "another feature of the bicrossproduct family is that the classical data of a matched pair of actions is entirely classical , consisting in the poincar case of a certain non - linear action of the lorentz group on the nonabelian momentum group @xmath46 and vice versa . as a result",
    "the orbits of the lorentz group in momentum space are classical but ` squashed ' into regions with limiting surfaces or accumulation boundaries .",
    "this phenomenon is identical to that first discovered in the @xmath47 case @xcite , where the spherical orbits were deformed into non - concentrically nested spheres squashed into a region of @xmath32 ; in the @xmath48 case the mass hyperbolae are similarly squashed into a cylinder @xmath49 . in recent years",
    "some authors have sought to rebrand the bicrossproduct model as ` doubly special ' because of this remarkable feature of squashed orbits and the feature of being able to refer everything to classical nonlinear equations , but without actually producing any genuinely new model with quantum group symmetry .",
    "both features are in fact typical of bicrossproduct models with noncompact factorising groups if one wants other examples , and i refer to @xcite for a recent review . of perhaps more interest is how the bicrossproduct model emerges as a limit of a @xmath50-deformed geometry and how this in turn emerges from quantum gravity with cosmological constant , matters which are explored in the 2 + 1 case in @xcite .",
    "given a manifold @xmath16 , a metric @xmath51 with levi - civita connection @xmath52 and a conformal killing vector field @xmath13 , we define in @xcite a noncommutative spacetime coordinate algebra @xmath11 consisting of elements of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 by which we mean , eg , smooth functions on @xmath16 , and product defined via commutation relations @xmath55=\\imath\\lambda_p",
    "\\tau(f),\\quad\\forall f\\in c(m).\\ ] ] one can think of this as a cross product of @xmath56 by the group @xmath57 with action defined by @xmath13 and at least when @xmath16 is compact make everything precise as a cross product @xmath58-algebra .",
    "next , given any pointwise invertible function @xmath15 we define a differential calculus as , by definition , a space of 1-forms @xmath59 spanned by usual 1-forms from @xmath16 along with two extra 1-forms @xmath60 , with the commutation relations between functions and differentials@xcite @xmath61=0,\\quad & & [ f , t]=\\imath\\lambda_p \\tau(f),\\quad [ { { \\rm d}}f , g]=\\imath\\lambda_p{\\bar g}^{-1}({{\\bar{{\\rm d}}}}f,{{\\bar{{\\rm d}}}}g)\\theta'\\nonumber\\\\ { } [ \\theta',f]=0,\\quad [ \\theta',t]&=&\\alpha\\imath\\lambda_p \\theta',\\quad   [ { { \\rm d}}f , t]=\\imath\\lambda_p({{\\rm d}}\\tau(f)-{{\\rm d}}f)\\nonumber\\\\   { } [ f,{{\\rm d}}t]&=&\\imath\\lambda_p{{\\rm d}}f,\\quad [ { { \\rm d}}t , t]=\\imath\\lambda_p(\\beta\\theta'-{{\\rm d}}t).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath62 , where @xmath63 if @xmath16 has dimension @xmath64",
    ". one of the jacobi identities will quickly lead you to see that you need @xmath13 to be a conformal killing vector .",
    "we do rather more in @xcite , building @xmath65 directly on the space of classical 1-forms @xmath66 extended by two extra dimensions @xmath67 .",
    "the general principle of defining a differential structure via a bimodule of 1-forms ( or an entire differential graded algebra ) is common to most approaches to noncommutative geometry@xcite .",
    "we also consider 2-forms @xmath68 and show in @xcite that the calculus is locally inner , i.e. in the neighbourhood of any point one can find a function @xmath69 such that @xmath70=\\imath\\lambda_p{{\\rm d}}\\psi,\\quad \\{\\omega,\\theta\\}=-\\imath\\lambda_p{{\\rm d}}\\omega\\ ] ] for all @xmath71 in the noncommutative coordinate algebra and all noncommutative 1-forms @xmath72 .",
    "finally , we show that for all normal ordered @xmath73 the exterior derivative has the form @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the classical spatial exterior derivative , @xmath76 is the finite difference operator @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the classical laplace - betrami operator on @xmath16 .",
    "we use the inverse metric to view the classical 1-form @xmath79 as a vector field , which we regard as a differential operator .",
    "finally @xmath80 is a deformation of the laplacian or double - derivative in the @xmath8 direction .",
    "we define the spacetime wave operator by @xmath81 in keeping with a philosophy that the extra dimension @xmath82 plays the role of the conjugate to the wave operator regarded as a ` noncommutative vector field '",
    ".    one can apply this to the spherically symmetric 3-geometry @xmath12 underlying the schwarzschild black hole . here",
    "@xmath83 where @xmath84 for a black hole of mass @xmath16 centred at the origin .",
    "then the classical black hole has the form of our static metric with @xmath85 moreover , the 3-geometry has a conformal killing vector field @xmath86 .",
    "hence by the above we have a quantum spacetime and a wave operator on it deforming that of a classical black hole .    as this wave operator and noncommutative geometry is a little hard to compute , we also propose@xcite and in practice work with a more down to earth version of the theory where we let @xmath87 with its conformal killing vector field @xmath88 .",
    "then the spacetime is the usual flat spacetime bicrossproduct model with relations ( [ bicxt ] ) .",
    "but for the calculus we take @xmath89 as in ( [ betabh ] ) which is no longer the 5d flat space calculus@xcite for this model .",
    "its wave operator is then not the flat space one used in @xcite but nor is it quite the black hole as we took a flat 3-geometry . to fix this we use the correct @xmath90 in place of the one computed from the flat metric .",
    "we call this the ` minimally coupled black hole ' as we basically adapted a flat space computation by replacing derivatives by covariant ones .",
    "explicitly , @xmath91 is our ` minimally coupled ' noncommutative black hole wave operator . here",
    "@xmath92 is the 2-sphere covariant derivative such that @xmath93 on the spherical harmonics @xmath94 .",
    "the nontrivial part is to compute @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath96 .",
    "then@xcite @xmath97 if we denote the expression in large parentheses as @xmath98 then the noncommutative wave equation becomes@xcite @xmath99 on normal - ordered @xmath71 with @xmath8-dependence to the right .",
    "we shall study this wave equation under the physical hypothesis that observed fields are to be identified in our model with normal ordered fields as a measure of quantum gravity corrections .",
    "note that as @xmath100 we have @xmath101 so we obtain @xmath102 in this limit .",
    "this has the correct classical limit for the black hole wave equation .",
    "also in the limit @xmath103 we have @xmath104 so we obtain the standard bicrossproduct flat space wave operator used in @xcite , which replaces time derivatives by the finite difference ones @xmath76 .",
    "however , the function @xmath98 also has a nice limit @xmath105 as @xmath106 , i.e. close to the event horizon .",
    "so the noncommutative geometry as visible in the wave operator smooths out the coordinate singularity normally occurring there ; in some sense it makes it one dimension better as a log in place of a @xmath107 .",
    "it similarly improves matters at the other boundary @xmath108 which is the other side if an interregnum or ` skin ' region in which the logarithm has a negative argument .",
    "we will take a close look at both boundaries by means of a scaling limit . the geometrical picture that we refer to",
    "is shown in figure  1 for positive and negative @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath109{bhpic.pdf}\\ ] ]",
    "to study this limit @xmath110 further , we set @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the planck length and @xmath17 is the distance from the horizon in planck units . then @xmath113 hence @xmath114 times the wave equation ( [ bhwave2 ] ) becomes @xmath115 although @xmath116 is what it is ( about @xmath117 ) we can simplify this equation from a mathematical point of view by setting @xmath118 .",
    "this should be viewed as no more than a certain scaling limit approximation in which some quantum gravity effects are ignored but a certain remnant remains . in this",
    "limit the wave equation in these coordinates becomes @xmath119 if we assume bounded angular momentum so that @xmath120 .",
    "here @xmath121 is , roughly speaking , the frequency of a wave of wavelength the size of the black hole , as @xmath122 is the schwarzschild radius .    -.5 cm @xmath123{bhlimitext.pdf}\\ ] ] @xmath124{bhbesselj.pdf}\\includegraphics[scale=.6]{bhbesseli.pdf}\\ ] ] @xmath125{bhlimitr.pdf}\\includegraphics[scale=.6]{bhhyper.pdf}\\ ] ] @xmath126{bhlimitl.pdf}\\ ] ] @xmath127{bhlimitint.pdf}\\includegraphics[scale=.6]{bhbesseliint.pdf}\\ ] ]    we look at @xmath71 with time - dependence @xmath128 ( separating variables ) .",
    "then the equation ( [ bhwave3 ] ) becomes for each mode of frequency @xmath72 , @xmath129 where @xmath71 is now a function just of @xmath17 .",
    "remembering the original physical interpretation of @xmath17 , we see that for a given sign of @xmath72 there is a strip of width @xmath130 planck lengths where the argument of the logarithm is negative . specifically , this happens if @xmath131 thus we have qualitatively the same kind of ` quantum skin ' or ` interregnum ' region in our scaling limit as for the original theory in figure  1 , but now with width @xmath130 .",
    "this lies just inside the event horizon for positive frequencies and just outside it for negative frequencies .",
    "as long as we stay out of these regions , we have real solutions .",
    "we use mathematica to compute numerical solutions , but our goal is to gain an analytic understanding of them in different regimes .",
    "we focus on @xmath4 but return to the negative frequency case at the end .",
    "\\(i ) _ @xmath132 far outside the event horizon _ if we assume that @xmath133 then we can expand the logarithm .",
    "at lowest nontrivial order we obtain the conventional wave equation in unusual coordinates @xmath134 thus , if we write @xmath135 then the wave equation has solutions @xmath136 if we do a little better and expand to the next cubic order , the wave equation takes the approximate form @xmath137 this has solutions @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a bessel i function but extended to complex @xmath64 and the @xmath140 function is a normalisation . in another context",
    "one might consider taking @xmath141 real in which case note the poles in the normalisation factor of @xmath142 at @xmath143 positive integer @xmath144 .",
    "figure  2(b ) on the right confirms , however , that the case of real @xmath72 is wave - like and indeed asymptotes to the plane waves just found when @xmath17 is large .",
    "note that the plot is against log @xmath17 with @xmath145 .",
    "the approximation ( [ approx ] ) means that we can only approach the horizon to @xmath146 planck lengths before quantum gravity effects render the weak field ( i.e. small @xmath122 or large @xmath6 ) expansion invalid .",
    "thus , the right side of figure  2(b ) is only valid for @xmath147 and this is confirmed on comparison with the numerical solution in figure  2(a ) .",
    "( ii)_@xmath148 just outside the event horizon _ the numerical solution in figure  2(a ) continues down to @xmath149 or so on the log plot .",
    "at some point we enter the regime @xmath150 where the logarithm is suppressed and the wave equation becomes @xmath151 as a result the wave stops being so exponentially stretched in the direction of increasing @xmath17 ( it begins to be stretched in the logarithmic plot ) and starts to behave as a linear combination of @xmath152 where @xmath153 are bessel j and y functions .",
    "these have respectively a finite value and zero slope at the event horizon @xmath154 or an infinite value and finite slope at @xmath154 in the logarithmic plot .",
    "thus we conclude that the equation ( [ bhwave3 ] ) has a full set of solutions outside the event horizon becoming exponentially stretched plane waves for large @xmath17 and tending to either a constant or a constant @xmath155 ( the slope in the logarithmic plot ) at the event horizon @xmath154 . a generic boundary condition set at large @xmath17",
    "will stimulate the latter @xmath156 mode and result in a log divergence at the horizon , so this is presumably the fate of an infalling wave .",
    "however , a wave created at the event horizon ( which would be relevant to beckenstein - hawking radiation ) could take the form of the regular @xmath157 mode .",
    "( iii)_@xmath158 in the skin layer _ we now look inside the event horizon .",
    "initially , for small negative @xmath17 we are in the same regime as in ( ii ) , except that there is now a term @xmath159 term in the wave operator if we take the standard choice of branch of the logarithm .",
    "this system can be solved using hypergeometric functions as @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "we focus for the moment on @xmath162 which has a finite value and zero slope at the event horizon and can therefore match the @xmath157 ( bessel j ) on the other side .",
    "its continuation further into the ` skin ' region acquires an imaginary part and both parts grow rapidly as we go deeper into the skin ( more negative @xmath17 ) .",
    "the values at @xmath163 are ( according to mathematica ) given by a laguerre l function and appear to grow very rapidly with @xmath3 . in figure  2(c ) we show this analytic approximate solution on the right and for comparison the full numerical solution , which is similar . the boundary condition is a real value 1 and zero slope at or close to @xmath154 and we have reduced to @xmath164 in order to have a visible comparison at a point where significant ` amplification ' starts to appear .    for solutions driven by real conditions at ( or rather , just inside )",
    "the interior boundary @xmath163 the numerical solution is shown in figure  2(d ) for a modest @xmath165 .",
    "in general a significant visible amplification in the numerical solution ( say a factor of some @xmath166 ) sets in around @xmath167 and a comparable imaginary part is similarly acquired , i.e. much as we had going the other way . however , close inspection of the numerical solution appears to indicate that even for the example shown , there is in fact a log divergence at @xmath154 .",
    "( this is more visible in the middle scenario in our later figure  3 where we have used a log scale so that a log divergence is a straight line and where we have suppressed a very large imaginary component in the plot allowing us to see a bit more detail than in figure  2(d ) . )",
    "this brings us back to the hypergeometric mode @xmath161 .",
    "this indeed has a log divergence in its real and imaginary part and a similar form in the region @xmath168 .",
    "even though the approximation used breaks down as we approach @xmath163 , as confirmed by the detail in figure  3 mentioned , a generic boundary condition there can be expected to propagate into the region where the approximation ( [ innerapprox ] ) is valid and thereafter drive this mode to produce a log divergence .",
    "the divergence can be matched in real slope at @xmath154 on the log plot to that of a @xmath169 ( bessel y ) mode outside , although the role of the similarly divergent imaginary part is not entirely clear .",
    "it is presumably related to the logarithmic asymptotic form .",
    "overall , we see that there is a significant asymmetry in the modes crossing in the ` skin layer ' from the black hole interior , which appear to diverge as @xmath161 just inside the horizon , and @xmath157 modes crossing from outside the event horizon which are regular at the horizon and match to @xmath162 modes inside .",
    "( iv)_@xmath170 black hole interior _ as we continue further with negative @xmath17 we return again to the regime @xmath171 and we are back to ( [ bhcubic ] ) , this time with @xmath172 .",
    "if we change variables to @xmath173 we have the same equation but with @xmath174 .",
    "hence the cubic correction enters with the opposite sign .",
    "we have the same solutions bessel functions @xmath175 with imaginary @xmath64 as before but now an @xmath176 in the argument . as figure  2(e ) on the right confirms , we still have wave - like behaviour and these tend for large negative @xmath17 to plane waves in log plot .",
    "the difference is that whereas the bessel function in regime ( i ) showed a slight stretching of the waves in the log plot compared to large @xmath17 , now we see a slight compression in the log plot compared to large negative @xmath17 .",
    "we again see a good fit with the numerical solutions , shown for real boundary conditions of finite amplitude / zero derivative , or vice - versa .",
    "we have returned to @xmath145 and have matched normalisation at large negative @xmath17 .",
    "( v)_negative frequencies _ we have focussed on @xmath4 . if we suppose instead that @xmath5 then note in ( [ bhwave3w ] ) that we can change back to @xmath4 if we also change @xmath17 to @xmath173 . hence the story for @xmath5 is exactly the same as above but with a left - right reflection in all of figure  2 .",
    "this time a mode entering from far outside the event horizon is slightly ( but finitely ) compressed compared to the overall frequency - independent compression expressed in the log plot , and diverges just above the classical event horizon .",
    "meanwhile , a mode entering from the black hole ` interior ' is slightly ( but finitely ) stretched in the log plot , crosses the classical event horizon without coordinate singularity and is amplified as it passes out the other side .",
    "all of this behaviour is remarkably similar to that of the full theory in @xcite , suggesting that our simplified scaling limit wave equation ( [ bhwave3 ] ) shares many qualitative features with the full wave equation .",
    "the only thing missing is that we can not investigate ` standing waves ' in the black hole interior .",
    "this is because our scaling limit covers only the geometry near the horizon and a fixed number of planck lengths from it ( this includes the skin region ) .",
    "in effect , on entering the black hole interior the wave solutions in figure  2(e ) continue on towards the origin but this is considered as infinitely far away for a macroscopic black hole . on the other hand , one could consider a different scaling limit in which @xmath178 and @xmath64 is fixed as @xmath118 to analyse planck size black holes in the model",
    ". this will be looked at elsewhere .",
    "meanwhile , the propagation in the two directions across the event horizon is summarised in figure  3 . because the orbital angular momentum was washed out in our scaling limit and because we are far from the centre of the black hole ,",
    "the system is more like propagation in a line .",
    "more precisely , two lines laid end to end .",
    "thus , one could change variables to @xmath179 for @xmath180 and @xmath181 for @xmath172 and arrive at a more conventional @xmath182 or @xmath183 for the spatial part .",
    "we have refrained from this only in order to keep the original context . in the log plot in figure  3",
    "the interior and exterior propagations each span a factor of @xmath166 in @xmath17 and are set at @xmath145 .",
    "however , this would result in extremely high ` amplification ' factors in the skin region and hence for purposes of illustration only , we have set @xmath184 for solution in the skin region .",
    "the boundary conditions are generally mixed ones setting amplitude and gradient , with the arrows indicating the location of the boundary condition and solving the equations from there , rather than indicating ` direction of travel ' , which we have not particularly analysed .",
    "although it does not appear to be too singular the equation at @xmath163 is numerically ill - conditioned and as a result the boundary conditions are set just inside the skin region rather than right on the boundary .",
    "we should also say that the physical interpretation of all of these features remains problematic .",
    "we have not discussed here issues such as unitarity ( this is likely to be a problem ) but it should be remembered that the entire noncommutative model is intended as an effective description of quantum gravity effects rather than a self - contained closed system . however , at least at first sight it would appear that waves from infinity are likely to log diverge at the classical event horizon @xmath154 .",
    "we have seen that one can also create modes at the event horizon which are regular there and extend to waves outside . inside the skin",
    "they grow rapidly and acquire an imaginary component , and the ( now complex ) solution appears to be matchable to waves continuing into the interior .",
    "this is shown in the lower part of figure  3 . meanwhile , in the middle of figure  3 we show waves in the interior which appear to be matchable to a solution inside which becomes complex and has a log divergence at @xmath154 , this time on the inside of the classical event horizon .",
    "all of this is for positive frequency with a reversed picture for negative frequency .",
    "this represents a significant time - asymmetry , which is to be expected .",
    "whether the log divergences at @xmath154 are important is not clear as they could be artefacts of the scaling limit ; in the actual quantum gravity model presumably other physical effects would take over ."
