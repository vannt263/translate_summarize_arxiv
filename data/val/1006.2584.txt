    "in the past decade , more than 400 extrasolar planets have been discovered around nearby solar - type stars .",

    "the observed mass - period ( @xmath11 ) distribution of these planets appear to be non - uniform @xcite . with a set of well - define and carefully - selected sample ,",
    "potential observational selection effects may be quantitatively identified and taken into account @xcite .",
    "analogous to the stellar color - magnitude diagram for galactic and globular clusters , genuine oasis and deserts in planets @xmath11 distribution of a controlled samples can be used to cast constraints and provide clues to the theory of planet formation and planetary - system evolution .",
    "preliminary results of our first sets of simulations essentially reproduced known - planets observed @xmath11 distribution and the fraction of planet - bearing stars as a function of their mass and metallicity ( papers ii and iii ) .",

    "many uncertainties remain in the prescriptions adopted for these models .",

    "these properties are determined by the not - so - well understood physical processes such as the efficiency of turbulent angular momentum transport ( items 1 & 3 ) and retention of heavy elements in the form of grains ( items 2 & 3 ) , planetesimals , and embryos ( items 4 & 5 ) . with regard to item 6 , in the sequential accretion hypothesis ,",
    "the formation of gas giants must be preceded by the emergence of cores with several @xmath29 s @xcite .",
    "these uncertainties are not independent of each other .",
    "in particular , the fraction of solar - type stars which bear gas giants depends on the inventory of building block material and the retention efficiency of cores . in paper iv",
    ", we demonstrated that in disks with power - law @xmath13 and @xmath20 distributions , the observed @xmath8 would be achievable only if 1 ) the disk is more massive than the mmsn model ( _ i.e. _ @xmath30 ) , and 2 ) type i migration is relatively inefficient ( _ i.e. _ @xmath31 ) .",
    "these requirements need not be satisfied throughout the disk provided there are special locations in the disk where building - block grains can accumulate and embryos type i migration may be suppressed ( see paper v ) . in this context",
    ", the ice line appears to be a preferred birth place for gas giants because it provides a natural barrier against the orbital decay of grains ( due to hydro dynamic drag ) and protoplanetary embryos ( due to type i migration ) @xcite .",
    "the period distribution of the simulated models which take into account of the preferred birth place of gas giants ( paper v ) can match well with a conspicuous ( 2 - 3 yrs ) up - turn in observed period distributions of jupiter - mass planets provided @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "ongoing transit searches and high - precision radial velocity surveys have led to the discovery of many short - period ( with @xmath5 less than a week ) gas giants . according to the population synthesis models",
    ", these planets relocated to their present - day orbit either through type ii migration or dynamical instability and relaxation .",
    "for this scenario , we need to verify : 1 ) criteria for gas giants relocation shortly after their formation , 2 ) efficiency of relocation processes , 3 ) condition for stalling dynamical evolution , and 4 ) extent of gas giants mass loss and orbital decay during the main sequence life span of their host stars . through detailed quantitative comparisons between population - synthesis models and observational data",
    ", we can calibrate the efficiency of various relevant and competing processes .",
    "in addition to the reproduction of known observational properties ( mostly for gas giants ) , population - synthesis models may also be used to make some robust predictions .",
    "a particularly noticeable feature in the simulated @xmath11 distribution is a domain of planetary desert for intermediate mass ( @xmath33 ) and period ( weeks to months ) planets with comparable gas and solid internal composition .",
    "while the actual boundaries of this parameter region depend on the values of various input parameters ( such as @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath26 etc ) , the paucity of planets in this domain is robust , mainly due to the combined effects of runaway gas accretion ( paper i ) and type i migration ( paper iv ) .",
    "this region of parameter space would be filled if the gas accretion onto the cores is significantly slowed down by inefficient heat transfer in the infalling envelope or type i migration is grossly inhibited everywhere in the case where planetesimal accretion of migrating cores is not inhibited@xcite .",
    "thus , forthcoming observations can be used to distinguish key assumptions associated with these models .    in the context of quantitative predictions",
    ", the simulated planet distribution also highlights rich populations of both earth - mass rocky planets and long - period ice giants . during the early epochs of disks evolution ( especially when they undergo repeated fu ori outbursts ) , @xmath19 , @xmath13 and @xmath20",
    "are much larger than their values in the mmsn model . in principle",
    ", embryos can rapidly undergo oligarchic growth @xcite and attain isolation masses @xmath34 which are sufficiently large ( @xmath35 ) to initiate dynamical gas accretion exterior to the ice line ( paper i ) .",
    "however , even with a modest amount of type i migration ( _ i.e. _ @xmath36 ) , the embryos would migrate towards their host stars before they reach their isolation masses ( paper iv ) . in inner regions at @xmath37au , the surface density of rocky materials",
    "is severely depleted by type i migration of embryos that start migration after they acquire mass comparable to their isolation mass ( paper iv ) .",
    "the fate of these embryos is determined by their retention probability .",
    "if they are efficiently retained , they would emerge as conspicuous super - earths .",
    "in contrast to gas giants type ii migration , embryos type i migration and retention processes in the proximity of their host stars are poorly understood . in papers",
    "i - v , we counted the number of embryos ( with different masses ) which are expected to cross some inhibited inner disk boundary .    in this paper ,",
    "we consider various physical processes which may regulate embryos dynamical evolution and determine the formation and retention probability of super - earths at various locations .",
    "this follow - up study is timely because recent radial - velocity surveys with high - cadence ( several time nightly ) and precision ( down to @xmath38 m / s ) have led to the announced discoveries of several super - earths with masses and periods up to @xmath0 and a few months ( mayor _ et al .",
    "these data also suggest super - earths may exist around nearly half of all nearby solar - type stars and in many cases in the form of non - resonant multiple - planet systems ( m. mayor , s. udry , private communication ) .",
    "this trend , when confirmed with a well - defined controlled sample , would suggest there may be many earth - mass or sub - earth slowly - growing cores which failed to accrete any significant amount of gas before their natal disk is evaporated .",
    "they also highlight the importance of dynamical interaction between multiple embryos during their formation and subsequent evolution .    in order to analyze the asymptotic evolution of multiple - embryo systems ,",
    "we briefly summarize , in  2 , some relevant physical processes and introduce a set of generic prescription which can be reliably used to quantitative approximate embryos interaction with each other and their natal disks . in  3 , we utilize this prescription , along with our previously established algorithms , to carry out some case studies for formation of multiple rocky / icy planetary systems around a majority of solar type stars which do not bear any gas giant planets . based on the results of paper i and iv , we suggest these planets formed in relatively low or modest mass disks .",
    "these disks generally have gas surface density ( @xmath13 ) less than 2 - 3 times that of the minimum mass solar nebula ( mmsn ) model .",
    "we show that prior to gas depletion , dynamically isolated embryos emerge with sub - earth masses and nearly circular orbits in the inner parts of these disks ( _ i.e. _ interior to the ice line ) .",
    "we refer to this first epoch as the embryos - emergence stage .    during the ( second ) migration and accumulation stage",
    ", these embryos rapidly migrate to proximity of their host stars .",
    "under various circumstances , embryos migration may be stalled in the inner regions of disks around classical t tauri stars . after the gas depletion , the congregated embryos perturb each other s orbits . within the next @xmath39 myr ,",
    "dynamical instability induces embryos to cross each other s orbits and growth through cohesive collisions . during this ( third ) giant impact stage , super - earth form with periods between a few days to months and modest eccentricities ( @xmath400.1 ) .",
    "as the host stars mature , inelastic and cohesive collisions between embryos with modest relative periapse longitudes damp their eccentricities . in the absence of gas giants ,",
    "systems eventually evolve into a ( fourth ) stabilizing state in which the residual planets crossing timescale becomes larger than the age of the system .",
    "we show that these models naturally accounts for the origin of a known population of non - resonant multiple earth / super - earth systems with periods ranging from days to months .",
    "the asymptotic mass of some planets may exceed that ( several earth masses ) needed to initiate efficient gas accretion in a mmsn environment .",
    "but these planets acquired most of their masses through giant impacts after the gas is depleted from their natal disks . in the absence of gas accretion ,",
    "such super - earths do not evolve into gas giants .",
    "finally , we summarize our results and discuss their implications in  4 .",
    "the main difference between the present investigation and that in papers i - v are : 1 ) the inclusion of resonant capture between embryos during type i migration , and 2 ) the calculation of embryos orbital and mass evolution after the gas depletion .",
    "these effects are important for the formation of multiple earths and super - earth systems through collisional merger ( giant impact ) events .",
    "we describe in this section some modification and additions to our method of treating these interactions .",
    "although disk gas accretion rates in the inner regions and the surface density of dust in the outermost regions of protostellar disks have been observationally inferred , there are no reliable observational constraints on the gas and heavy - element surface density distribution especially near the planet forming regions . theoretical determination of these quantities relies on poorly determined magnitude of angular momentum transfer efficiency .",
    "in light of this uncertainty , we adopt the mmsn model @xcite as a fiducial set of initial conditions . in our population - synthesis model",
    ", we introduce multiplicative factors ( @xmath21 and @xmath41 ) to scale the disk surface densities of gas ( @xmath13 ) and planetesimals ( @xmath20 ) with those of the mmsn model . following paper iv , we set @xmath42 where normalization factors @xmath43 and @xmath44 correspond to 1.4 times of @xmath13 and @xmath20 at 10au of the mmsn model , and the step function @xmath45 inside the ice line at @xmath46 ( eq .

    "v , we considered disk evolution with constant @xmath17 and the ice line barrier for migration ( a local @xmath13 maximum is due to a transition in the thickness of mri active layers across the ice line ) . in this paper",
    ", we use a simple power - law disk model in order to focus our attention on the effects of dynamical interactions that we now take into consideration in our sequential planet formation model .",
    "nevertheless , we specify an inner disk boundary where @xmath13 vanishes and planetesimals type i migration is arrested ( see  2.5 ) .    neglecting the detailed energy balance in the disk @xcite , we adopt the equilibrium temperature distribution of optically thin disks prescribed by @xcite such that @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are stellar and solar luminosity . in this simple prescription",

    "we also assumed that after the gas depletion embryos and planetesimals velocity dispersion becomes comparable to surface escape velocity of the most massive embryos at that location .",

    "for example , in papers iv and v , decreases in @xmath20 due to accretion by independent planetary embryos are computed only in the feeding zones centered around their original locations .",
    "but , in the presence of disk gas , embryos undergo type i migration due to imbalance in the tidal torques from outer and inner disks ( see  [ sec : migrat ] ) .",
    "relocation to regions with different surface densities ( which is also depleted by previous generation of embryos ) would modify embryos growth rate and asymptotic mass . in order to take into account the possibility of growth along migration path",

    "this awkward scheme was introduced for computational convenience . in the context of gas - giant formation ,",
    "embryos evolve into dynamically isolated cores with nearly circular orbits in gaseous environment .",
    "this approximation is adequate for the evaluation of their individual growth and migration .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume @xmath20 is depleted in this inside - out manner without the consideration of any competitive neighbors .    in the present paper , however , we intend to determine the mass spectrum and kinematic distribution of multiple planetary systems around common host stars . here , we need to consider the concurrent disk evolution along with the mass and dynamical evolution of several coexisting embryos in evolving disks ( see below and  [ sec : migrat ] ) . under some circumstances , it is possible for the @xmath20 decline to be a non monotonic function of @xmath67 .",
    "( for example , the emergence of relatively massive embryos across the ice line can lead to the formation of `` gaps '' in the @xmath20 distribution . ) in order to take this possibility into account , we compute the evolution of @xmath20 distribution due to accretion by all the emerging embryos in a self - consistent manner .    in our newly modified scheme , the growth and migration of several embryos",
    "are integrated simultaneously with the evolution of the @xmath20-distribution .",
    "we set up linear grids for @xmath21 across the disk with typical width of @xmath79au .",
    "we introduce a population of seed embryos , all with an initial mass @xmath80 g ( _ i.e. _ that of the residual planetesimals ) and compute their mass accretion rate . in the inner disk region ( interior to the ice line ) , we set the initial separation of these seed planetesimals at any given location @xmath81 to be the full feeding - zone width ( @xmath82 ) of embryos with local asymptotic isolation mass @xmath83 . we justify this prescription on the basis that in location where @xmath84 , any seed embryos with closer initial separations would have merged and additional embryos would have formed unless the entire disk is filled with isolated embryos .",

    "we classify all the affected embryos by their overlapping ( relative to the modified pair ) radial excursion ( epicycle amplitude ) into closely interacting groups .",
    "these groups generally contain several ( @xmath287 ) embryos .",
    "we assume that the most massive embryo in each group dominates the outcome of successive close encounters within the group .",
    "the characteristic post - encounter eccentricity ( @xmath266 ) for all but the most - massive embryos is given by equation ( [ eq : close_scat ] ) in which @xmath288 is used to represent the most massive embryos in the group .",
    "we also assume the post - encounter eccentricity of the most - massive embryo is determined mostly by the second - most - massive embryo .",
    "+ in general , successive close encounters lead to radial diffusion of the orbit - crossing embryos . in our prescription , changes in embryos semimajor axis",
    "are given by values chosen @xmath289 .",
    "the statistical weight @xmath290 ( which has a skewed distribution within a limited range between -1 and 1 ) is introduced to reflects the kinematic distribution of the orbit crossing embryos .",
    "if the total mass ( @xmath291 ) of all the encountering embryos in the group inside a particular embryo s orbit is more than that ( @xmath292 ) outside it , its probability of orbital expansion would be larger than that of orbital decay . in order to simulate this effect",
    ", we introduce a parameter @xmath293 and set @xmath294 where @xmath281 is a random number with a uniform distribution in the range of @xmath295 $ ] . with the results of n - body simulations , we also calibrate the magnitude of a constant @xmath296 .",
    "+ finally , close - encounters also excite embryos inclination .",
    "magnitude of the orbital inclinations in radian may be about half of that of eccentricities @xcite .",
    "however , the orbital inclinations do not directly affect the condition for orbit crossing , we are not concerned with embryos inclinations in this paper . 5 .",
    "after the relative changes in the semimajor axes of all the orbit crossing embryos have been evaluated , we renormalize their semimajor axes by a constant numerical factor so that the total orbital energy of all the embryos in the group is conserved . in general",
    ", the modification of the semimajor axes introduced by this renormalization procedure is less than a percent order .",
    "this simple algorithm does introduce artificial changes in the total angular momentum of the encountering embryos .",
    "+ although , with a more complicated non - uniform renormalization factor , we can also conserve the total angular momentum of all the embryos in the group , we opted to limit the degrees of freedom at the expense of a small change in the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "after multiple close encounters and merger events , the total departure from angular momentum conservation of the entire system is limited to within 10% in typical models .",
    "close encounters also leads to physical collisions .",
    "we assume all physical collisions are cohesive and lead to merger events . among the embryos in the orbit crossing group , a colliding pair ( @xmath297 )",
    "is chosen .",
    "however , after the impulsive momentum changes during repeated close - encounters not every chosen pairs from this group would retain overlapping orbits . if the radial excursions of any chosen pair do not overlap , another pair would be chosen until all available candidates are exhausted .",
    "( for example , after a close encounter between embryos 1 and 2 , the former may cross the orbits of embryos 3 and 4 whereas the latter may cross the orbits of embryos 3 and 5 .",
    "if collisional candidates are chosen to be embryos 1 and 5 , this pair would be rejected . )",
    "+ in order to take into account various factors which contributes to the collisional probabilities , we select the appropriate embryos with a statistically weighted random number .",
    "n - body simulations show that collision frequency decreases with embryos semimajor axes ( because keplerian period is longer and embryos spatial density is lower at larger semimajor axis ) .",
    "we adopt a weighted collisional probability which is proportional to @xmath298 .",
    "a merged embryo is created from each colliding pair .",
    "since we neglect fragmentation and rebound , the merged embryo acquires the total mass of the colliding pair . in the direct n - body simulations , the center of inertia and the total momentum",
    "are conserved after each cohesive collision . in our prescription , we do not follow the exact location and kinematics of the merger product .",
    "instead , we use conservation laws to determine orbital elements of the merged embryos . + in principle ,",
    "a small fraction of orbital angular momentum is transformed into spin angular momentum after each collision . however , the spin angular momentum is usually negligible .",
    "total kinetic energy of the colliding embryos is also not conserved , because the collision dissipates kinetic energy of the relative motion and the merging changes binding energy .",
    "however , if their velocity dispersions are smaller than their two - body surface escape velocity ( @xmath299 ) , the collisional dissipation energy is approximately equal to the change in the binding energy . in practice , the total orbital energy of the colliding pair is approximately conserved during the collision as well as the total angular momentum . + assuming the conservation of orbital energy , the semimajor axis of the merged body ( @xmath300 ) is given by @xmath301 in the case of @xmath155 , it is difficult to accurately evaluate the eccentricity of the merged body from the angular momentum conservation . here",
    ", we assume that after each collision , the mass - weighted total laplace - runge - lenz vector is conserved .",
    "this assumption holds for collisions between embryos with nearly circular keplerian motion ( _ i.e. _ @xmath155 ) @xcite . in this limit",
    ", the eccentricity of the merged body ( @xmath302 ) is given by @xmath303 where @xmath304 s are longitudes of periastron at the collision .",
    "+ due to the secular perturbation between orbit - crossing embryos , @xmath305 and @xmath306 generally precess independently over all angles . in principle",
    ", both longitudes can be chosen with uniformly distributed random phase ( between 0 and @xmath307 ) . however , even with overlapping regions of radial excursion , the orbits of a pair of eccentric embryos would only cross each other if the relative angle between their longitudes of periastron ( @xmath308 ) is within some limited range .",
    "for example , eccentric embryos would not cross each other s",
    "orbits if their longitudes of periastron are aligned with @xmath309 . in contrast , orbit crossing generally occurs between embryos with @xmath310 in some limited range centered at 180 degrees , provided @xmath311 and @xmath312 are larger than @xmath313 .",
    "+ in our prescription , we randomly generate a value of @xmath314 between 0 and @xmath307 .",
    "we assume secular perturbation generally induces the longitudes of periastron of any pairs of embryos with overlapping orbits to precess and circulate so that their @xmath310 can always enter into the range ( @xmath315 ) which allows them to collide .",
    "we first compute the magnitude of @xmath315 with independent keplerian orbits for the neighboring embryos .",
    "we then take into account that embryos gravitational perturbation on each other tends to slightly broaden this range .",
    "the value of @xmath310 at the collision is randomly chosen from a value within the range @xmath315 .",
    "the value of @xmath316 is then specified by @xmath314 and @xmath310 . since the preferred value for @xmath310 is @xmath317 , the summation in the r.  h.  s. of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lrl_sum ] ) usually results in cancellation , so that @xmath302 is often significantly smaller than @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "8 .   for updating the system time ,",
    "we need to take into consideration 1 ) the time interval for neighboring embryos to cross each other s orbits ( @xmath320 in equation [ eq : tau_cross ] ) and that required for embryos to collide with each other @xmath321 . before each collision ,",
    "embryos with overlapping orbits undergo repeated close scattering as @xmath310 circulates in and out the range of @xmath315 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath321 for embryos with overlapping orbits is determined by their area filling factor ( see paper i ) .",
    "n - body simulations indicate that at a fraction of au , @xmath322 for earth - size embryos .",
    "+ for pairs with moderately large initial separation ( @xmath323 ) , @xmath324 and it is adequate to update the evolution of the system from @xmath68 to @xmath325 .",
    "pairs with small initial separation ( @xmath326 ) are closely packed with wide range of @xmath315 .",
    "since it takes longer for them to collide than to cross each other s orbit , we update the evolution with a randomly generated @xmath321 which has a uniform distribution in the range @xmath327 .",
    "thus , the new system time is given by @xmath325 for @xmath328 and @xmath329 otherwise . + after some collisional events , it is possible for the merger product to become dynamically isolated from all other embryos in the group .",
    "n - body simulations also indicate that following other cohesive collisions , several additional merger events may follow in rapid succession . for example , in a group of 4 orbit - crossing embryos , embryos1 and 2 may merge first .",
    "the newly form embryo may attain a new orbit which continues to overlap those of embryos 3 and 4 . in that case",
    ", it is possible for the newly merged embryo to subsequently coagulate with embryos 3 or 4 or both . in order to take these possibilities into account ,",
    "we repeat step 2 to 7 for all group members after each merger event , until their @xmath277 ( including the collisional lag time ) has exceeded the integration time .    in step 7 ,",
    "we indicate that the merger product attains an eccentricity ( @xmath302 ) which is often significantly smaller either than @xmath318 and @xmath319 .",
    "this apparent eccentricity damping is due to the effect that merger events can only occur for a limited range between the longitude of periastron of the colliding embryos . consequently , embryos asymptotic eccentricities are usually smaller than @xmath156 .",
    "this inference is consistent with the results of previous n - body simulations @xcite .    in the prescription presented here ,",
    "the only free empirical parameters are i ) the weighted changes in the semimajor axis in step 4 and ii ) the broadened range of @xmath315 in step 6 .",
    "all the other procedures are based on fundamental dynamics although some of their efficiencies are approximated .",
    "the weighted @xmath67 changes and the broadening of the phase range are also qualitatively based on celestial mechanics .",
    "the quantitative parameters for these processes are determined by comparison with the results obtained by n - body simulations @xcite .",
