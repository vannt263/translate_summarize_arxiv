    "soon after the discovery of the fe - based superconductors ( fe - sc ) great effort has been devoted to unveil their electron paring mechanism . even after nearly a decade of intensive research , the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is still under dispute @xcite , nonetheless most theories favor an unconventional @xmath0 symmetry with a sign change of the order parameter between the hole and the electron fermi sheets @xcite .    among the members of the family of fe - sc ,",
    "the binary compound fese has attracted considerable attention recently .",

    "further , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 @xmath2  k @xcite in bulk fese can be enhanced up to 37  k by application of pressure @xcite and even to 50 - 100  k by growing it as a monolayer on a srtio@xmath3 substrate @xcite",
    ". another unique feature of fese is that it undergoes a structural phase transition from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic phase at @xmath4 87  k @xcite , which is not accompanied or followed by a long - range magnetic order . at @xmath5 , the @xmath6-rotational symmetry of the underlying electronic system",
    "is also spontaneously broken .",
    "the resulting electronic state with a @xmath7 symmetry is referred to as a nematic phase .",
    "it is argued that the symmetry of the superconducting order - parameter should give insight into the collective degree of freedom that governs both superconductivity as well as nematicity in the fe - sc @xcite .",
    "however , the situation on the experimental front is far from being resolved . even in the case of single crystalline fese with relatively simple crystal structure ,",
    "different experiments indicated different superconducting gap structures .",
    "while most experiments detected two superconducting gaps @xcite , no consensus has been reached concerning the magnitude of the superconducting gap as well as on the presence or absence of nodes within the structure .",
    "the residual linear component of the thermal conductivity @xmath8/t in the @xmath9 0 limit , which is particularly sensitive to nodal quasiparticles , revealed contradicting results @xcite .",
    "further , surface sensitive scanning tunnelling spectroscopic ( sts ) measurements , performed on single crystalline @xcite and thin film samples @xcite , detected `` v''-shaped spectra in the superconducting state indicating the presence of nodes .",
    "however , sts conducted on the twin boundaries displayed a full gap @xcite , suggesting nodeless superconductivity at the twin boundaries . in order to resolve this issue , it is necessary to perform both bulk and surface sensitive experiments on fese . owing to the marked dependence of the superconducting properties even for fese samples grown by the same method @xcite",

    "a few protrusions ( see fig .",

    "the most prominent feature of the spectrum is that , as @xmath84 , the spectrum attains a `` u''-shape . here",
    ", `` u''-shape refers to the finite energy range within which the experimental tunnelling conductance is zero , as more clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) . due to the estimated small magnitude of the smaller gap ( see above ) a zero tunnelling conductance is only expected within a very narrow energy range .",
    "a tunnelling conductance of zero indicates the absence of quasiparticle excitations within the superconducting gap , thus providing strong evidence for a nodeless superconductivity in fese .",

    "although the fitted curve followed the experimental data well in the applied bias voltage range @xmath91mev , below 0.5 mev , the fitted curve deviated from the experimental data as @xmath84 .",
    "this suggested the presence of a small second gap as already inferred from the specific heat analysis .",
    "however , the coherence peaks corresponding to the smaller gap could not be resolved in our experiments due to its small magnitude , which is at the limits of our instrumental resolution . to take this into account",
    ", we included an energy resolution of 0.16 mev in the fit procedure , which accounts for the spectral broadening caused by thermal effects ( 0.35 k ) as well as a finite modulation voltage ( 0.05 mv@xmath92 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](d ) , the best fit to the experimental spectrum is presented .",

    "these values are slightly different than those obtained from the specific heat analysis . here",
