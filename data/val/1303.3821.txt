    "measures of both the paradigms have proven to be advantageous in investigations of cooperative physical phenomena observed in many - body systems @xcite . due to the paucity of analytical as well as numerical methods to solve quantum spin models , most of these considerations are restricted to the ground state or the thermal state of the system . while it is important to understand the quantum correlation properties of these  static states \" of the system , the time - evolution of the system is an integral part of several quantum information processing protocols , a prominent example being the one - way quantum computer @xcite .",

    "variation of different physical parameters in this model leads to the appearance of rich phases @xcite , like spin - liquid , resonating valence bond states , etc",

    "the usual statistical mechanical description of a physical quantity is valid only when the time - average of the quantity matches with its ensemble average , and in that case , the physical quantity is termed as ergodic .",

    "the statistical mechanical notions like canonical equilibrium state , time - evolved state and ergodicity will be briefly defined in this section , mainly to set the terminology and the notations . in particular , we introduce a quantity called the  ergodicity score \" which helps us to quantify the degree to which a physical quantity is possibly nonergodic .      for the quantum spin system , described by the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "experimental studies of the heisenberg model in @xmath1 lattices have been proposed e.g. , in trapped ions @xcite and optical lattices @xcite .",
    "we consider a quantum heisenberg xyz spin model on a square lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions between the nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "periodic boundary condition is assumed and hence , geometrically , the system forms a spin - arrangement on a torus .",
    "the time - dependent magnetic field is assumed to be active at all sites .",
    "like in the ladder and @xmath0 models , we again find that the entanglement measures are ergodic for all values of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the initial magnetic field @xmath114 .",
    "interestingly , unlike in the @xmath0 and ladder systems , the transition from nonergodicity to ergodicity of the information - theoretic measures , occurs for relatively low values of the @xmath109-interaction strength , i.e. , for low values of @xmath24 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2d ] ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath130 are 0.6 , in the ladder and @xmath0 systems , both quantum discord and quantum work - deficit remain nonergodic till @xmath131 , while they both become ergodic in @xmath1 at @xmath132 .",
    "these observations lead us to infer that information - theoretic measures are more sensitive to the dimension of the lattice , than the entanglement measures , with respect to their statistical mechanical properties .",
    "quantum heisenberg models have created lot of interest due to their rich physical properties and the possibility of realizing such systems in artificial materials as well as in inorganic compounds .",
    "however , investigations into the dynamics of such models , for example , under the influence of time - dependent magnetic fields , are limited by the fact that the system can not be diagonalized analytically . here , we have studied the behavior of quantum correlations , both from the entanglement - separability paradigm and the information - theoretic one , of the equilibrium state as well as the evolved state of the quantum heisenberg anisotropic xyz model , by numerical simulations . in particular",
    ", we found that although entanglement measures are ergodic irrespective of the system parameters , information - theoretic measures exhibit a rich picture , with respect to their statistical mechanical properties .",
    "specifically , we find that the @xmath109-interaction strength has a cross - over value , for a given @xmath5-anisotropy and a given information - theoretic quantum correlation measure , that indicates a transition from nonergodic to ergodic behavior for that measure .",
    "the qualitative features of the measures in the entanglement - separability paradigm and the information - theoretic one are the same in the one - dimensional , ladder , and two - dimensional square lattices . however , in the square lattice , the information - theoretic measures are more sensitive to the change of the @xmath109-interaction strength than in other dimensions",
    ". such dimension - dependent change of ergodic behavior is absent for entanglement measures .",
