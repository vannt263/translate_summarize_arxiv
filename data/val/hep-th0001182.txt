    "it is now commonly admitted that our current concepts about space and time have to be changed when exploring space - time at a very small scale .",
    "indeed , one can show that it is impossible to locate a particle with an arbitrarily small uncertainty when taking both into account the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity @xcite .",
    "roughly speaking , one can say that measurements of coordinates on space - time are subject to uncertainty relations , thus ruining all geometrical concepts that have proved to be a guidance principle in elaborating many physical theories .    following the previously alluded analogy with quantum mechanics",
    ", one can try to solve this puzzle by assuming that the coordinates themselves are noncommuting objects .",
    "thus , the natural extension of geometrical ideas to this new type of coordinates has been called `` noncommutative geometry '' . following even closer the ideas and methods of quantum mechanics , we are led to assume that these noncommutative coordinates are represented as a subalgebra of the algebra of operators acting on a hilbert space .",
    "this is the framework of the theory pioneered by a. connes @xcite , which allows us to make use of the powerful tools of functional analysis . within this framework ,",
    "an analogue of gauge theory has been developed , even with non trivial topological properties , and it has already proved to be useful in various areas of physics , ranging from the classical description of the higgs sector of the standard model ( see @xcite for a review ) to recent ideas in string theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this last example involves what we will call _ noncommutative yang - mills _ ( ncym ) theories in the sequel and can be thought of as a generalization of non - abelian gauge theories , whose gauge symmetry and interactions involves the noncommutative nature of the coordinates .",
    "a first example of such a theory appeared almost ten years ago , when connes and rieffel developed classical two dimensional yang - mills theory on the noncommutative torus @xcite .",
    "this idea has also been generalized to higher dimensions @xcite .",
    "this naturally raises the question of the quantization of such theories , which has been tackled , at the one loop order , on the tori in @xcite and on noncommutative @xmath5 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although these theories turned out to be non local , i.e.  their interacting vertices involve trigonometric functions of the incoming momenta , it turns that the one - loop behavior is quite similar to the standard non - abelian case .",
    "this relies on an older work of filk @xcite , who proved that the trigonometric factor of any planar graph ( in a sense to be defined below ) does not involve trigonometric functions of the internal momenta flowing into the loops , thus exhibiting the same divergence as the standard theory .",
    "however , this is not true for non planar diagrams whose trigonometric factor does involve a phase depending on the internal momenta .",
    "obviously such a phase softens the ultraviolet behavior of the corresponding diagram and it has been conjectured by several authors that such a diagram is in fact finite @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been pointed out that this is not always the case @xcite . indeed ,",
    "if the non planar diagram contains some special kind of non planar subdiagrams whose standard degree of divergence is strictly greater that zero , which is the case in a scalar field theory , the small momentum behavior of these diagrams yields a new kind of infrared divergence intimately tied up with the non locality .",
    "this short paper is devoted to a survey of this problem in the simple case of multiloop corrections to the ghost propagator involving only nested and disjoint subdivergent one loop corrections to the ghost propagator . in the following section we shall briefly review the problem raised in @xcite and",
    "then we shall present an explicit computation of the corresponding diagrams , postponing a complete probe into the renormalization of ncym theory to a future publication .",
    "before entering into the details of ncym theory , let us recall that the noncommutative @xmath5 is the algebra generated by @xmath6 hermitean elements @xmath7 with commutator @xmath8 = -2\\mathrm{i } \\theta_{\\mu\\nu}$ ] , where @xmath9 denotes a real antisymmetric matrix which we will assume to be of maximal rank for convenience .",
    "furthermore , one introduces fourier modes @xmath10 , with @xmath11 .",
    "we will always think of a smooth and at infinity rapidly decreasing function as a fourier transform @xmath12 where @xmath13 is itself a smooth and rapidly decreasing function on standard @xmath5 .",
    "the commutation relations of the coordinates endow the algebra with the star product @xmath14 which yields @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "finally , this algebra is equipped with the analogue of an integral defined as @xmath17 and partial derivatives @xmath18 which satisfy most of the properties of their commutative counterparts : positivity and definiteness of the integral , leibniz rule , commutativity of partial derivatives and integration by part , together with the tracial property of the integral @xmath19 which proves to be fundamental in the construction of gauge invariant theories .    at that point ,",
    "two additional remarks are in order .",
    "first of all , let us notice that the matrix @xmath9 explicitly breaks lorentz invariance ( or its euclidian counterpart ) , which is reduced to the transformations commuting with @xmath20 , whereas translational invariance is preserved . furthermore ,",
    "as @xmath9 is dimensionful , it also breaks scale invariance already at the classical level , for instance , in the case of four - dimensional ncym theory or for a two - dimensional scalar field theory .    from now on , one easily constructs scalar field theories , like @xmath21 , whose euclidian action is @xmath22 = \\int \\big ( \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_\\mu \\phi \\star_\\theta   \\partial_\\mu \\phi + \\frac{m^2}{2 } \\phi \\star_\\theta \\phi + \\frac{g}{4 ! } \\phi",
    "\\star_\\theta \\phi \\star_\\theta \\phi \\star_\\theta   \\phi\\big ) ~,\\ ] ] or the ncym action @xmath23 & = -\\frac{1}{4}\\int\\ ! f_{\\mu\\nu } \\star_{\\theta}f^{\\mu\\nu }   ~ ,   \\qquad \\mbox{with } \\\\",
    "f_{\\mu\\nu } & = \\partial_{\\mu } a_{\\nu}-\\partial_{\\nu}a_{\\mu }   + g ( a_{\\mu } \\star_{\\theta}a_{\\nu}-a_{\\nu } \\star_{\\theta}a_{\\mu})~. \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because of the tracial properties of the integration , the latter enjoys invariance under noncommutative gauge transformations @xmath24    perturbative quantization of these theories is easily performed within a formal functional integral point of view : the quadratic parts of the actions are equal to their commutative counterparts , whereas the interactions are non local and exhibit trigonometric functions of the incoming momenta of the interaction vertices .",
    "thus , the total contribution of any feynman diagram can be written as the product of a rational function by a trigonometric function . because trigonometric functions are bounded , the standard rules of powercounting are unchanged so that weinberg s convergence theorem remains valid .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that for planar diagrams the trigonometric function is independent of the internal momenta so that the feynman integral reduces to the one encountered in a commutative field theory . for non planar diagrams",
    "the situation is more involved and we mainly have to distinguish two cases : whether the non planarity results from crossing of internal lines ( i.e.  from the non planar character of the amputed diagram ) , which we call type i diagrams , or whether it solely comes from crossing of internal lines whith external lines ( type e ) .",
    "the latter case is much more tricky because the phase vanishes when the corresponding external momenta satisfy some particular relation .",
    "the corresponding feynman integral has been evaluated in @xcite within schwinger s regularization scheme .",
    "it turns out that a type i non planar diagram whose powercounting subdivergent non planar diagrams are all of type i will be convergent , the corresponding singularity when the schwinger parameters goes to zero being removed . if the diagram is of type e , but does not contain any subdivergence of type e , it is non singular , except for some exceptional values of its external momenta .",
    "most of the trouble comes from the insertion of type e non planar subdivergences .",
    "indeed , the latter correspond to feynman integrals of the type @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the independent internal momenta , @xmath27 are the external momenta and @xmath28 are linear combinations of the external momenta .",
    "the rational function @xmath29 is responsible for the subdivergence .",
    "when all the @xmath30 s which couple to internal momenta belonging to divergent integrals do not vanish , the corresponding integral can be considered as finite , being regularized by the oscillatory factor . indeed , a computation with a cut - off introduced within schwinger s parametric formula yields such a finiteness .",
    "however , whenever one of the @xmath30 s coupled to a divergent loop integral vanishes , then the corresponding feynman integral is just a usual divergent loop integral and yields a singularity . when inserted into a larger diagram",
    ", this could create some trouble when integrating over momenta approaching the subspace @xmath31 .",
    "the question is how fast the divergence appears compared with the smoothening property of the integration measure .",
    "a quadratic divergence seems to destroy the renormalizability @xcite whereas a logarithmic divergence could be harmless .",
    "this conjecture is supported by our simple example .    in a mathematically more satisfying manner",
    ", one can also consider such an integral as a well defined distribution which is nothing but the fourier transform of the rational fraction @xmath32 .",
    "however , we still have to face a problem when inserting the distribution into a larger feynman diagram .",
    "in particular , the example described in @xcite corresponds to a distribution which is nothing but the feynman propagator and the infrared troubles when @xmath33 are quite similar to the usual small @xmath34 singularities encountered in qft .    finally , let us point out that we did not encounter such a problem when quantizing ncym theory on a torus @xcite .",
    "the construction of the latter is similar to that of ncym on @xmath35 except for the quantization of the momenta appearing in the fourier transform . as a consequence",
    ", there is no singularity when @xmath33 since such a limit can not be taken .",
    "however , we noticed that a one loop non planar diagram with external momenta @xmath36 exhibits an extra uv singularity of the type @xmath37 .",
    "quite miraculously , all these singularities turn out to cancel , leaving us with finite one loop renormalized correlators .    in the next section",
    ", we shall evaluate the non planar contribution to some of the one loop corrections to the ghost self energy using bessel functions , showing that they do not lead to any singularities when inserted into larger diagrams .",
    "we shall use the feynman rules for ncym theory without deriving them , the latter being obtained by replacing the structure constant of non - abelian gauge theory @xmath38 by @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "our goal is to compute the following 1-loop correction to the ghost propagator in ncym theory : @xmath40 wavy lines represent gluons and straight lines ghosts . the feynman rules derived in @xcite and ( for the noncommutative torus ) @xcite",
    "lead to the integral @xmath41 we work in a @xmath42 dimensional euclidian momentum space with metric @xmath43 and use obvious abbreviations such as @xmath44 . using feynman parameters",
