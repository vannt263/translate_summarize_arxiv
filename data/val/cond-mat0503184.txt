    "there have been many recent experiments with the aim of observing bose condensation of polaritons in two - dimensional microcavities .",
    "recent experimental progress includes nonlinear increase of the occupation of the ground state@xcite , sub - thermal second order coherence@xcite , changes to the angular dispersion of polariton luminescence@xcite increased population of low momentum polaritons@xcite , and stimulated processes in resonantly pumped cavities@xcite .",
    "such experiments however do not provide unambiguous evidence for the observation of a polariton condensate as distinct from , _",
    "e.g. _   a novel kind of laser .",
    "theoretical predictions of the detailed properties of polariton condensation are therefore of considerable interest . in this paper",
    ", we consider the form of the phase boundary , and experimental signatures of condensation .",
    "we include the internal structure of polaritons , and fermionic structure of excitons .",
    "the phase boundary at low densities may be described by a model of weakly interacting bosons@xcite . at higher densities ,",
    "internal polariton structure becomes important , and the phase boundary approaches the result of a bcs - like mean - field theory .",
    "for a zero - dimensional cavity , the mean - field theory is correct at all densities , but in a two - dimensional cavity , fluctuations cause a crossover to the weakly interacting boson limit at low densities .",
    "this crossover is shown in the top panel of the phase diagram , figure  [ fig : phasediag ] .",
    "the crossover scale is set by the wavelength of light , rather than average exciton separation , and so occurs at densities much less than the mott density .",
    "figures  [ fig : phasediag ] and  [ fig : mu - rho - t ] also show the effect of detuning the exciton below the photon on the phase boundary . as in the mean - field case@xcite , detuning can lead to a multi - valued phase boundary .",
    "however , with fluctuations this multi - valued structure occurs for smaller detunings than are required for the mean - field case .",
    "we also discuss a number of experimentally testable signatures of a coherent state of polaritons .",
    "these include dramatic changes in the luminescence and absorption spectra , as shown in figures  [ fig : simple_spectrum ] and  [ fig : dos ] , and in the angular distribution of radiation emitted from the condensate , as shown in figure  [ fig : nofk ] .",
    "these signatures are a consequence of a coherent photon field , and of the presence of the goldstone mode associated with symmetry breaking . in a previous publication@xcite ,",
    "some of these results were presented in the absence of exciton - photon detuning . in this paper",
    "we present in full the calculation which led to those results , and extend our results to include detuning and inhomogeneous broadening of the excitons .",
    "we consider a model of localised excitons coupled to a continuum of radiation modes confined in a two - dimensional microcavity .",
    "this provides an extension of previous studies@xcite of the mean - field ( zero - dimensional ) system . a model of localised excitons",
    "is motivated by systems such as organic semiconductors@xcite , quantum dots@xcite and disordered quantum wells@xcite .",
    "in addition , the predictions of such a model are expected to be similar to those for a model of mobile excitons , since a typical exciton mass is several orders of magnitude larger than the typical photon mass .",
    "we study the behaviour of this model in thermal equilibrium .",
    "although current experiments may remain far from equilibrium , there are several reasons to study the equilibrium behaviour . as the quality of microcavity fabrication , and particular the quality of mirrors improve@xcite",
    ", experiments can be expected to reach states closer to thermal equilibrium .",
    "further , the nature of experimental signatures for coherence close to equilibrium are expected to be similar to those in thermal equilibrium .",
    "finally , the equilibrium distribution may be considered a limiting case of the non - equilibrium problem , when pumping and decay rates are taken to zero , so the equilibrium case is thus instructive in approaching the non - equilibrium problem .",
    "the hamiltonian we study is similar to the holland - timmermans hamiltonian@xcite studied in the context of feshbach resonances in atomic gases .",
    "however , there are a number of important differences between the two models ; most notably the absence of a direct four - fermion interaction , and the bare fermion density of states .",
    "how these differences affect the mean - field results is discussed in section  [ sec : comp - mean - field ] , and their effect on the fluctuation spectrum in sections  [ sec : effect - acti - fluct ] and  [ sec : poles - greens - funct ] . because our system is two - dimensional , it is necessary to study fluctuations in the presence of a condensate .",
    "such fluctuations have recently been studied by ohashi and griffin@xcite in the context of the feshbach resonances . despite differences in the models ,",
    "we disagree with their use of partial derivatives of the free energy w.r.t .",
    "chemical potential , rather than full derivatives . as we show , their approach neglects terms of the same order as those that are included .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the hamiltonian for our model , and discuss how it will be treated .",
    "section  [ sec : greens - funct - fluct ] reproduces the mean - field results presented elsewhere , and then discusses the effective action , and resulting spectrum of fluctuations about it .",
    "from the fluctuation spectrum , a number of experimental signatures are also discussed .    in section  [ sec : fluct - corr - dens ] we explain how to calculate fluctuation corrections to the mean - field phase diagram . some of the issues in this section are associated with the specific details of our model , or with fluctuations in two dimensions , but others are relevant to the calculation of fluctuation corrections in general .",
    "section  [ sec : new - phase - boundary ] presents the results of including fluctuations , and discusses the effects of detuning and inhomogeneous broadening on the phase boundary .",
    "the discussion presented in section  [ sec : new - phase - boundary ] does not require the details presented in section  [ sec : fluct - corr - dens ] , and readers not interested in the theoretical explication may move directly to section  [ sec : new - phase - boundary ] . finally , in section  [ sec",

    ", we discuss in general how such terms may arise in the thermal green s function , but vanish after analytic continuation and so are not present in the retarded green s function .",
    "our model describes localised two - level systems , coupled to a continuum of radiation modes in a two - dimensional microcavity . considering only two levels describes a hard - core repulsion between excitons on a single site .",
    "we do not consider a static coulomb interaction between different sites .",

    "the transition studied by hepp and lieb was later shown by rzaewski _",
    "et al . _",

    "the transition in our model , when @xmath32 does not suffer the same fate@xcite : the sum rule of rzaewski _ et al . _  which prevents condensation no longer holds when @xmath32 .    in order to integrate over the two - level systems , it is convenient to represent them as fermions , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "for each site there then exist four states , the two singly occupied states , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the unphysical states @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    following popov and fedotov@xcite the sum over states",
    "may be restricted to the physical states by inserting a phase factor @xmath39 .",
    "since the hamiltonian has identical expectations for the two unphysical states , this phase factor causes the contribution of zero occupied and doubly occupied sites to cancel , so the partition sum includes only physical states .",
    "such a phase factor may then be incorporated as a shift of the matsubara frequencies for the fermion fields , using instead @xmath40 .",
    "thus , from here we shall describe the two - level systems as fermions .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ eq:1 ] ) is a low energy effective theory , and will fail at high energies .",
    "this theory is not renormalisable ; there exist infinitely many divergent one particle irreducible diagrams , and so would need infinitely many renormalisation conditions .",
    "these divergent diagrams lead to divergent expressions for the free energy and density .    to treat this correctly",
    ", it would be necessary to restore high energy degrees of freedom , which lead to a renormalisable theory .",
    "integrating over such high energy degrees of freedom will recover , for low energies , the theory of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "one may then calculate the free energy for the full theory , with appropriate counter terms .",
    "the low energy contributions will be the same as before , but the high energy parts differ , however such high energy parts are not relevant at low temperatures . as we are interested only in the low energy properties of this theory , we will introduce a cut off @xmath41 .",
    "the coupling @xmath12 is assumed to be zero between excitons and those photons with @xmath42 .",
    "a number of candidates for this cutoff exist ; the reflectivity bandwidth of the cavity mirrors , the bohr radius of an exciton ( where the dipole approximation fails ) , and the momentum at which photon energy is comparable to higher energy excitonic states ( for which the two - level approximation fails ) . which of these scales becomes relevant first depends on the exact system , however changes in @xmath41 will lead only to logarithmic errors in the density .",
    "we first briefly present the results of refs .   for the mean - field analysis .",
    "integrating over the fermion fields yields an effective action for photons : @xmath43&= &    \\int_0^{\\beta } d\\tau    \\sum_k    \\psi^{\\dagger}_k \\left(\\partial_{\\tau } + \\hbar { \\tilde{\\omega}}_k\\right )   \\psi^{}_k    + n    \\mathrm{tr } \\ln \\left({{\\mathcal m}}\\right )    \\\\    \\label{eq:6 }    { { \\mathcal m}}^{-1 } & = &      \\left (      \\begin{array}{cc }        \\partial_{\\tau } + { \\tilde{\\epsilon } } &         \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{a}}\\sum_k e^{2\\pi i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r_j } }         \\psi^{\\vphantom{\\dagger}}_k \\\\        \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{a}}\\sum_k e^{-2\\pi i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r_j } }         \\psi^{\\dagger}_{k } &        \\partial_{\\tau } - { \\tilde{\\epsilon}}\\end{array }    \\right )    \\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then proceed by minimising @xmath44 $ ] for a static uniform @xmath45 and expanding around this minimum .",
    "the minimum , @xmath46 , satisfies the equation : @xmath47 which describe a mean - field condensate of coupled coherent photons and exciton polarisation .",
    "the mean - field expectation of the density is given by @xmath48.\\ ] ] note that the photon field acquires an extensive occupation , we may define the intensive quantity @xmath49 : the density of photons in the condensate .",
    "this corresponds to an electric field strength of @xmath50 .    for an inhomogeneously broadened band of exciton energies , eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) should be averaged over exciton energies . in this case condensation",
    "will introduce a gap in the excitation spectrum of single fermions@xcite : whereas when uncondensed there may be single particle excitations of energy arbitrarily close to the chemical potential , now the smallest excitation energy is @xmath51 .",
    "the existence of this gap is reflected by features of the collective mode spectrum discussed below .",
    "it is interesting to compare this mean - field condensed state , described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , to the superradiant state originally considered by dicke  @xcite .",
    "dicke considered a hamiltonian similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , but with a single photon mode .",
    "constructing eigenstates @xmath52 of the modulus and z component of the total spin , @xmath53 , dicke showed that for n particles , the state @xmath54 has the highest radiation rate .    taking the state described by the mean - field condensate , eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , and considering the limit as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the equilibrium state may be written as @xmath57 _",
    "i.e. _  a binomial distribution of angular momentum states .",
    "as n tends to infinity , this becomes a gaussian centred on the dicke super - radiant state , with a width that scales like @xmath58 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the above state represents only the exciton part ; this should be multiplied by a photon coherent state . in the self consistent state",
    ", there exists a sum of terms with different divisions of excitation number between the photons and excitons .",
    "these different divisions have a fixed phase relationship",
    ". such a statement would remain true even if projected onto a state of fixed total excitation number .",
    "this is different from the dicke superradiant state , which has no photon part . in the dicke state",
    ", the only important coherence is that between the different ways of distributing excitations between the two - level systems .",
    "the mean - field equations  ( [ eq:7 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:95 ] ) have a form that is common to a wide range of fermion systems .",
    "however , the form of the density of states , and the nature of fermion interactions can significantly alter the form of the mean - field phase boundary .",
    "it is of interest to compare our system to other systems in which bcs - bec crossover has been considered , and to note that even at the mean - field level , important differences emerge . to this end",
    ", we compare the mean - field equations for our modified dicke model to the holland - timmermans hamiltonian @xcite , and to bcs superconductivity@xcite .    for a gas of fermionic atoms , or bcs ,",
    "the density of states is non - zero for all energies greater than zero , whereas for our localised excitons , without inhomogeneous broadening , it is a @xmath59 function .",
    "one immediate consequence is a difference of interpretation of the mean - field equations ; the number equation and the self consistent condition for the anomalous green s function .",
    "for a weakly interacting fermion system the number equation alone fixes the chemical potential@xcite , and the self - consistent condition can then be solved to find the critical temperature . for our localised fermions , the chemical potential lies below the band of fermions , and so the density is controlled by the tail of the fermi distribution , so temperature and chemical potential can not be so neatly separated .",
    "this can remain true even in the presence of inhomogeneous broadening ; the majority of density may come from regions of large density of states in the tail of the fermi distribution .",
    "such differences are also reflected in the density dependence of the mean - field transition .",
    "the absence of a direct four - fermion interaction means that the effective interaction strength is entirely due to photon mediated interactions . since our model has the photons at chemical equilibrium with the excitons , this effective interaction strength depends strongly upon the chemical potential .    for bcs superconductors , and the bcs limit for weakly interacting fermionic atoms , the dependence of critical temperature upon density is due to the changing density of states , which appears in the self consistent equation as a pre - factor of the logarithm in the bcs equation @xmath60 . in contrast",
    ", the density dependence of @xmath0 for the dicke model is due to the changing coupling strength and occupation of two - level systems with changing chemical potential .",
    "such a change of coupling strength with chemical potential also occurs in the holland - timmermans model , near feshbach resonance , where the boson mediated interaction is not dominated by the direct four - fermion term .",
    "even with inhomogeneous broadening of energies , unless the chemical potential remains fixed at low densities , there will be a strong density dependence of @xmath0 as the effective interaction strength changes .",
    "the resultant phase boundary with inhomogeneous broadening , at low densities , is given in section  [ sec : effects - inhom - broad ] .",

    "these energy states mix .",
    "the photon then couples both to transitions @xmath75 and also to the degenerate transition @xmath76 .",
    "since this transition is between the two levels on a single site , inhomogeneous broadening does not soften the @xmath1 term .",

    "this approximation is equivalent to the assumption that the energies and positions of excitons sampled by photons of different momenta are independent and uncorrelated .",
    "such an approximation evidently can not hold for high momenta , as otherwise the number of random variables would become greater than the number of excitons . this approximation will also necessarily neglect scattering between polariton momenta states .",

    "the mean - field critical density at low temperature is approximately @xmath260 , which goes to zero more slowly than @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , including fluctuations in this regime does not change the form of the phase boundary drastically .",
    "hence at very low densities , the boundary is again well described by a mean - field theory .",
    "our model describes two - level systems with a finite total density of states  the density of states , per unit area , integrated over all energies , is finite .",
    "as will be explained below , this finite total density of states is responsible for the re - entrant behaviour seen in the mean - field theory for detunings @xmath262 . in the preceding sections ,",
    "the finite total density of states has also been implicated in explaining the existence of a photon dominated region at high temperature , and the multi - valued phase boundary in the presence of fluctuations .",
    "this section discusses how these effects may change in alternate models which do not have saturable two - level systems .",
    "although the multi - valued phase boundary is expected only to occur for a finite band of two - level systems , the existence of a photon dominated regime at high densities is more general .    before discussing the more involved question of how changing the density of states affects fluctuations , we first summarise its effect on the mean - field theory@xcite .",
    "consider the highest possible density achievable in the normal state .",
    "since there exists a bosonic mode , the chemical potential can not exceed the energy of this mode if the system is to remain normal .",
    "therefore at zero temperature , only exciton modes below the boson mode are relevant .",
    "regardless of whether the total density of states is finite , the density of states below the bosonic mode will be finite .",
    "however , at non - zero temperatures , exciton modes above the chemical potential can be occupied by the tail of the fermi distribution .",
    "if there is a finite total density of states , there will be a maximum density of excitons that can be occupied thermally .",
    "this is what is referred to as `` saturation '' below .",
    "note that for a exciton band centred at the bottom of the photon band , this maximum density of excitons is half the density of two - level systems  the system saturates at half filling .",
    "if the total density of states is not finite , it is possible to support any total density in the normal state by making the temperature high enough .",
    "this saturation is responsible for the multi - valued phase boundary in the mean - field theory .",
    "if the density is close to total inversion of the two - level systems , all two - level systems must be in the up state .",
    "this makes it hard for them to produce a macroscopic polarisation  viewed as spins , this is to say that if @xmath263 , then @xmath264 will be small .",
    "hence , the system becomes uncondensed near total inversion .",
    "if the excitation density is greater than the density of two - level systems , the mean - field theory requires a coherent photon density .",
    "hence , the system condenses again , giving a re - entrant boundary . without saturable excitons , neither the uncondensing due to reduction of mean - field polarisation , or the re - condensation due to exciton saturation will occur . with fluctuations ,",
    "the multi - valued phase boundary is analogous to the mean - field re - entrance , and appears to require saturable excitations in the same manner .",
    "therefore , we do not expect such multi - valued phase boundaries in a general model with a continuum of exciton states .",
    "let us now consider the case where there is a finite density of exciton states , separated by the exciton binding energy from a continuum of electron - hole states .",
    "in such a case , if the continuum is well separated from bound states , it may only affect the phase boundary at densities larger than those where the features discussed above occur .",
    "well separated here means that the exciton binding energy is much larger than the energy scales in our model , in particular , much larger than @xmath23 .",
    "if the continuum only has effects at very high densities , the exotic multi - valued phase boundary described in previous sections will be realisable . for the systems studied by yamamoto _",
    "et al._@xcite , @xmath232 , and the exciton binding energy @xmath265 . for dang _",
    "et al._@xcite , @xmath266 , and @xmath267 . in neither case can the effects of the continuum be avoided .",
    "reducing the rabi splitting , @xmath23 , might allow the multi - valued phase boundary to be observed .",
    "however , reducing the rabi splitting will decrease the transition temperature in the region of interest .",
    "in addition , to have well strong coupling , the rabi splitting must remain larger than the polariton linewidth due to photon lifetimes .",
    "the existence of a photon dominated region at high densities is however generic , and does not rely on a model with a finite total density of states .",
    "in an electron - hole plasma model@xcite , such a regime is also predicted . at large densities , as the chemical potential ( lying within the exciton band ) approaches the bottom of the photon band , the photon density increases much faster than the exciton density .",
    "the result in ref .   only describes a photon dominated regime at zero temperature .",
    "for the two - level system model , at high densities , the system remains photon dominated , and with increasing temperature changes from coherent to incoherent photons .",
    "such a change from coherent to incoherent photons is also expected to occur in the electron - hole model , due to the large occupation of bosonic modes near the chemical potential , but further work is required here .",
    "this discussion of how our model relates to experimental systems has so far concentrated on what happens at high densities . at lower densities ( including the densities of current experiments ) , no such significant differences are expected .",
    "this is because , at low densities , higher energy exciton modes would not be occupied , even if they exist .",
    "in particular , the angular distribution of radiation ( figure  [ fig : nofk ] ) and excitation spectrum ( figures  [ fig : simple_spectrum ] and  [ fig : dos ] ) should remain unchanged for generic models .",
    "such signatures should therefore be expected for equilibrium condensation in the systems currently studied .",
    "the signatures of condensation presented in this paper are calculated for a system in thermal equilibrium , while current experiments are pumped . for non -",
    "resonantly pumped experiments@xcite , one must consider how pumping will modify the excitation spectrum and the occupation of modes .",
    "this can be described by coupling the system to baths describing pumping of excitons and decay of photons . for systems near equilibrium , with small coupling to baths , one expects the excitation spectrum to remain close to the equilibrium case , but with non - thermal occupations .",
    "even with non - thermal occupation , the large density of states for excitations near the chemical potential can be expected to produce a peak in the angular distribution of radiation . for strong coupling to baths , the spectrum of excitations will also change .",
    "one particularly significant change is the possibility of giving a finite lifetime to the goldstone mode . in this strongly pumped region",
    ", the signatures predicted in this paper can be expected to change significantly .",
    "it is also of interest to discuss how these signatures are related to the behaviour seen in resonantly pumped cavities@xcite . in these experiments pumping at a critical angle",
    "excites polaritons at momentum @xmath268 , causing emission from signal , @xmath106 , and idler , @xmath269 , modes .",
    "such a system may be described as an optical parametric oscillator . above a threshold , the luminescence from the signal increases superlinearly , and the signal linewidth narrows dramatically . in such a system ,",
    "the occupation of the signal mode obeys a self - consistency condition , and the relative phase between the pump and signal mode is free .",
    "however , the nature of this self - consistency differs from that for an equilibrium condensate , and thus the signatures of equilibrium condensation are no longer immediately applicable .",
    "the form of the condensed luminescence spectrum , and the angular distribution of polaritons depend on the existence of the low energy goldstone mode .",
    "the energy of this mode vanishes as @xmath270 as a consequence of the gap equation , eq .",
    "( [ eq:7 ] ) , which means that global phase rotations cost no energy . in a laser ,",
    "the coherent field is also set by a self - consistency condition , balancing pumping and decay . like condensation",
    ", the laser transition can also be described as symmetry breaking@xcite . however , because the self - consistency relates imaginary parts of the self energy , the dynamics of modes near the lasing mode is diffusive .",
    "therefore a free global phase and a self - consistency condition are not sufficient for the signatures described in this paper .    for the optical parametric oscillator experiments , the self - consistency equation is complicated by the existence of a coherent idler field@xcite . since",
    "such experiments are strongly pumped it is expected that , despite the free phase and self - consistency , the luminescence spectrum and angular distribution of radiation as described in this paper will not be applicable . the laser and the equilibrium condensate are extreme cases , and the distinction in practice is less clear@xcite .",
    "for example , adding decoherence@xcite to an equilibrium condensate causes a crossover to a regime better described as a laser .",
    "we have studied the effect of fluctuations about the mean - field theory for a model of localised excitons coupled to a continuum of photon modes . when condensed , the presence of a gap in the fermion density of states , and the existence of the phase mode , cause dramatic changes to the spectrum of collective modes .",
    "such changes lead to signatures of condensation in the luminescence and absorption spectrum ( figure  [ fig : dos ] ) , and in the momentum distribution of radiation escaping the cavity ( figure  [ fig : nofk ] ) .    including the contribution to density due to fluctuations",

    "our study of the crossover can be compared to other studies of the crossover ; in feshbach resonance systems  @xcite , or for fermions interacting via a static four - particle interaction@xcite . in distinction to those systems , due to the nature of the fermion density of states in our system , there is no clear difference between the rles of the number and gap equations in the bec and bcs - like regimes .",

    "significantly alter the form of the phase boundary from its mean - field form , leading to a dependence @xmath271 .",
