    "the thermal radiation of photons and dileptons from a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is one of the most promising signatures for the formation of a qgp in relativistic heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "whereas real photons can be produced to lowest order @xmath3 only via the participation of a gluon , dileptons are produced to lowest order @xmath4 by quark - antiquark annihilation into a virtual photon ( born term ) @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of a small invariant photon mass @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the energy and @xmath7 the momentum of the photon , radiative corrections of the order @xmath8 become increasingly important .",
    "these corrections have been considered using perturbative qcd at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the production of real photons the dilepton production rate turns out to be infrared finite in the case of a vanishing quark mass . there is a cancellation of the infrared singularities of real and virtual contributions , the latter appearing only for the production of virtual photons @xcite",
    ". however , also medium effects leading to an effective quark mass @xmath9 by the interaction of the quark with the heat bath can screen these infrared divergences .",
    "altherr and ruuskanen @xcite suggested that the effective quark mass simply replaces the invariant photon mass as infrared cutoff if @xmath10 .",
    "medium effects can be included consistently using the resummation technique of braaten and pisarski @xcite .",
    "this method has been applied to a number of interesting quantities of the qgp leading to gauge invariant and infrared finite results that are complete to leading order in the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "for example , the production rate of energetic photons has been derived in this way , where a resummed quark propagator containing the effective quark mass @xmath11 has been used @xcite .",
    "here we want to reconsider the result of altherr and ruuskanen @xcite performing a complete calculation of the dilepton rate using the braaten - pisarski method analogously to the photon case .",
    "in particular we will study in detail the role of @xmath9 and @xmath12 as infrared cutoffs .",
    "like altherr and ruuskanen , we will restrict ourselves to small photon masses @xmath2 , for which the @xmath13-corrections are of importance , and to large photon energies @xmath1 .",
    "the lowest order matrix elements for the production of virtual photons from the qgp are shown in fig.1 . besides the real contributions ( compton scattering and annihilation ) of fig.1a ,",
    "b , appearing also for the production of real photons , there are virtual contributions , namely gluon absorption ( fig.1c ) and the interference terms of the born term with radiative corrections ( self energy insertion and vertex correction ) in fig.1d . due to phase space restrictions and kinematics ( @xmath1 ) the gluon absorption as well as the vertex correction",
    "can be neglected @xcite .",
    "the matrix elements can be related to the imaginary part of the photon self energy diagrams in fig.2 @xcite . here",
    "the processes of fig.1a , b , c can be obtained by cutting through the internal quark and gluon lines , while the interference term ( fig.1d ) corresponds to a cut through the quark lines only . in the latter case",
    "the quark self energy becomes on - shell , leading to an infrared singularity which cancels the one from the exchanged massless quark in the real contribution @xcite .",
    "this cancellation can be considered as an example of the kln - theorem at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "the production rate for massless electron and muon pairs derived from the photon self energy is given by @xcite = i m _ ^(p ) .",
    "[ e1 ] as in the case of the photon production rate @xcite , we want to include the effect of the medium by using a resummed quark propagator for soft momenta of the exchanged quark . for this purpose",
    "we introduce a separation scale @xmath15 @xcite , restricted by @xmath16 in the weak coupling limit . for quark momenta smaller than @xmath15 we will start from the photon self energy shown in fig.3 , where the blob denotes the effective quark propagator , in which the quark self energy in the hard thermal loop approximation has been resummed @xcite .",
    "owing to the high energy of the photon and energy - momentum conservation we need to take into account only one effective quark propagator and no effective vertices as opposed to the case of soft dileptons @xcite .",
    "for momenta of the exchanged quark larger than @xmath15 , the diagrams of fig.1 or fig.2 , containing only bare propagators , will be considered . after adding up the soft and hard contributions , the separation scale has to drop out , demonstrating the completeness of the calculation @xcite . in the case of the photon production a covariant separation scale , i.e. @xmath17 @xcite , and a non - covariant one ( @xmath18 ) @xcite have been used , both leading to the same result .    in the limit",
    "@xmath19 the hard real contribution ( fig.1a , b ) of the dilepton production rate can be taken over from the photon rate @xcite , yielding in the case of a non - covariant cutoff @xcite _",
    "hard^real = ^2_s e^-e / t , [ e2 ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in the case of a covariant cutoff",
    "the constant in the square brackets is changed by adding a term @xmath22 @xcite . the hard contribution to",
    "the photon rate follows from a momentum integration over the square of the matrix elements of fig.1a , b using distribution functions for the external partons . applying the boltzmann approximation for the distributions of the incoming partons and using @xmath23 the result ( [ e2 ] ) is found after some tedious manipulations .",
    "it can be obtained more easily by calculating the photon absorption rate and applying the principle of detailed balance @xcite .    the soft contribution to the dilepton rate",
    "can be computed by introducing spectral functions for the resummed quark propagator @xcite as in the case of the photon rate @xcite . following the arguments in the calculation of the photon rate we arrive at _ soft^real & = & d d ( e-- ) n_f ( ) n_f (  ) + & & \\ { ( 1 + ) + & & + ( 1- ) } , [ e3 ] where @xmath24 is the fermi - dirac distribution , @xmath25 the momentum of the bare quark propagator , and _ ( , k)= [ ( -_)+ ( + _ ) ] + _ ( , k ) ( k^2-^2 ) [ e4 ] the spectral functions with _ ( , k)=- . [ e5 ]",
    "the first term of the spectral functions ( [ e4 ] ) , containing the dispersion relations @xmath26 ( see fig.4 ) of the collective quark modes @xcite above the light cone ( @xmath27 ) , gives rise to the virtual contribution of the dilepton rate .",
    "the real soft contribution , on the other hand , follows from the second term below the light cone ( @xmath28 ) , which comes from the imaginary part of the hard thermal loop quark self energy . using @xmath1 and assuming @xmath29 and @xmath30 to be soft @xcite",
    ", the soft real contribution reduces to _ soft^real = e^-e / t dk d & & [ ( k-+e - p ) _ + ( , k ) + & & + ( k+-e+p ) _",
    "[ e6 ] the integration range , determined by @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and the separation scale @xmath18 or @xmath33 , respectively , are shown in fig.4 .",
    "compared to the photon case it is shifted by @xmath34 , which renders the integration in ( [ e6 ] ) more difficult . the logarithmic dependence on the scale @xmath15 can be extracted by adopting the static limit of the effective quark propagator @xcite , _ ( = 0,k)= .",
    "[ e7 ] in the case of a non - covariant separation scale @xmath15 , where the @xmath29-integration is restricted by the limits @xmath35 and @xmath30 , while the @xmath30-integration ranges from @xmath36 to @xmath15 , we find to logarithmic approximation _",
    "soft^real = e^-e / t^2 ( + a ) , [ e8 ] where we have used @xmath37 .",
    "in order to determine the function @xmath38 beyond the logarithm , we can not use the static approximation anymore , but have to solve ( [ e6 ] ) together with ( [ e5 ] ) numerically .",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath39 , which holds for realistic values of the coupling constant @xmath40 .",
    "then we find that @xmath41 increases from @xmath42 , which corresponds to the photon result @xcite , to @xmath43 .",
    "adding the hard contribution ( [ e2 ] ) to ( [ e8 ] ) with @xmath44 , the arbitrary separation scale @xmath15 drops out and we obtain an infrared finite result for the real contribution of the dilepton rate .",
    "on the other hand , using a covariant separation scale , ( [ e8 ] ) is multiplied by a factor @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "note that @xmath46 might be of the same order as @xmath23 for @xmath47 .",
    "hence the separation scale does not cancel in this case in contrast to the real photon rate ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this shows that we should demand that @xmath29 and @xmath30 are soft individually as it was also assumed in the derivation of the braaten - pisarski method , which is based on the imaginary time formalism in euclidean space - time @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider the virtual part coming from the pole contribution to the imaginary part of the photon self energy in ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "now we have to use a covariant separation scale since the infrared singularity in fig.2 comes from the on - shell self energy at @xmath49 .",
    "the soft part follows from the pole contribution of the diagrams in fig.3 corresponding to the first term of the spectral functions ( [ e4 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath50 lies always below @xmath51 ( see fig.4 ) , there is no hard contribution to the virtual part .",
    "thus the virtual contribution is determined solely by the imaginary part of the self energy in fig.3 coming from the pole of the effective quark propagator , which gives a finite result when integrated over the entire momentum range .    combining ( [ e3 ] ) and the first term of ( [ e4 ] ) we find ^virt & = & + \\ { & & _ k_min^+^k_max^+ dk n_f(_+ ) n_f(e-_+ )",

    ", we introduce again a separation scale @xmath57 .",
    "for @xmath58 we may approximate the distribution functions by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , whereas for @xmath61 we may set @xmath62 leading to @xmath63 and @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "hence the plasmino branch @xmath65 does not contribute for hard momenta as @xmath66 approaches @xmath30 exponentially for @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "for the part of the integrals in ( [ e9 ] ) containing the terms with @xmath68 it is sufficient to restrict to @xmath61 since the hard part is finite for @xmath69 .",
    "considering @xmath1 the simplifications @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 can be assumed .",
    "then this term reduces to the born term , which reads for @xmath1 and @xmath74 ^born= ^2 e^-e / t .",
    "[ e10 ] the born term is contained in the virtual contribution ( [ e9 ] ) because the effective quark propagator includes the bare one .",
    "next we consider the terms under the integral in ( [ e9 ] ) proportional to @xmath75 .",
    "using the approximations discussed above , we find for @xmath58 ^virt_soft & = & e^-e / t + & & .",
    "[ e11 ] we proceed analogously to baier et al .",
    "@xcite in the case of the photon rate , using @xmath76",
    ". then we obtain with @xmath77 ^virt_soft=- e^-e / t^2 ( + b ) .",
    "[ e12 ] the function @xmath78 decreases from @xmath79 , where the virtual contribution vanishes , to @xmath80 , where @xmath81 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "the hard part , @xmath61 , using the approximations given above , reads ^virt_hard=- ^2 _ k_s^e dk . [ e13 ] considering @xmath82 , we find ^virt_hard=- e^-e / t^2 . [ e14 ] adding up both the contributions ( [ e12 ] ) and ( [ e14 ] ) @xmath83 cancels and we arrive at ^virt=- e^-e / t^2 ( + b ) .",
    "[ e15 ] we observe that the virtual contribution coming from an interference term is negative , thus reducing the dilepton rate compared to the photon rate .",
    "furthermore , the virtual contribution vanishes for @xmath84 as it is also the case for the virtual contribution in naive perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the part under the integral in ( [ e9 ] ) proportional to @xmath85 can be shown to be suppressed by @xmath86 relative to ( [ e15 ] ) .    combining ( [ e2 ] ) ,",
    "( [ e8 ] ) , and ( [ e15 ] ) we end up with our final result for the dilepton production rate = ^2_s e^-e / t ( + c ) , [ e16 ] where the function @xmath87 ranges from @xmath88 to @xmath89 .    for giving an approximate analytic expression for @xmath90 we replace the exact dispersion relation @xmath91 by @xmath92 , which deviates from the exact one by less than 11% over the entire momentum range .",
    "then we obtain @xmath93 , restricted by @xmath94 .",
    "now we will discuss our result ( [ e16 ] ) for various limits of @xmath12 .",
    "for @xmath54 the virtual contribution vanishes since @xmath90 tends to infinity for @xmath95 .",
    "hence the dilepton rate is given by the real contribution which agrees with the photon rate in this limit .",
    "for @xmath96 we get @xmath97 .",
    "hence @xmath90 is given by the intersection of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , i.e. @xmath100 . thus the result for the photon rate holds approximately , which agrees with the result of altherr and ruuskanen @xcite , if we replace the invariant photon mass in the logarithmic term of their formula ( 2.18 ) by the effective quark mass in the case of @xmath10 as suggested in their paper .",
    "for @xmath47 , i.e. @xmath101 , we have to distinguish two cases .",
    "first @xmath102 , which leads to @xmath103 ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "then the logarithm in ( [ e16 ] ) is given by @xmath104 .",
    "secondly , in the case @xmath105 we find from fig.4 @xmath106 . now if @xmath107 we recover the photon result , while for @xmath108 the logarithmic term is given by @xmath109 .",
    "finally we will comment on the extrapolation of our result to realistic values of the coupling constant , @xmath110 - 0.5 , i.e. @xmath111 - 2.5 . in any case",
    "the lowest order result in @xmath13 fails if the rate ( [ e16 ] ) becomes negative .",
    "( this unphysical behaviour can originate from extracting the leading order contribution and extrapolating to large values of the coupling constant .",
    "a similar problem has been encountered in the case of transport rates determining thermalization times and the viscosity of the qgp @xcite . )",
    "thus one might expect that for @xmath47 the result gets unphysical , since @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",
    "however , for @xmath1 we find @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "hence we end up with a logarithmic term which is always positive . however , the constant @xmath87 behind the logarithm is of the same order ( typically half of the value of the logarithm ) , indicating the necessity to go beyond the logarithmic approximation .",
    "( this is more important for dileptons than for photons due to the negative virtual contribution . ) .    as an example we have chosen @xmath116 and @xmath117 mev . in fig.5",
    "the dilepton production rate is shown as a function of @xmath6 for @xmath118 mev and in fig.6 as a function of @xmath12 for @xmath119 gev .",
    "also shown is the result of altherr and ruuskanen @xcite .",
    "( here we replaced @xmath12 in their formula ( 2.18 ) by @xmath9 for @xmath10 . ) for the chosen set of parameters both approaches give similar results , since for @xmath120 mev both rates are given by the photon result approximately ( see fig.6 ) .",
    "however , the dilepton rate found by altherr and ruuskanen breaks down at somewhat larger values of @xmath6 as shown in fig.5 . in fig.5 also the born term ( [ e10 ] )",
    "is depicted for comparision .",
    "summarizing , we conclude that the complete calculation using a resummed quark propagator according to the braaten - pisarski method leads to a finite result for the dilepton rate to order @xmath0 , where the effective quark mass @xmath9 cuts off the infrared divergence . there is no need for using the invariant photon mass @xmath12 as an infrared cutoff even for @xmath12 of the order of the temperature ."
