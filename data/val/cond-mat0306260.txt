    "photonic crystals ( pcs ) are artificial materials whose dielectric functions periodically vary.@xcite the primary characteristics of pcs are photonic band gaps and peculiar dispersion relations , both of which enable the propagation of electromagnetic ( em ) waves in pcs to be controlled .",
    "recent interest in pcs has focused on `` open - system pcs,''@xcite which are connected to other structures at their boundaries .",
    "typically investigated are a finite pc contacting another medium and finite pc line - defect waveguides ( wgs ) . in open - system pcs",
    ", the energy of propagating em waves is transferred into or out of the pcs through the boundaries .",
    "this is in contrast to closed - system pcs , which are infinite in size and therefore contain all the energy at any time .",
    "an open - system pc can be divided into a set of subsystems  the pc and the attached structures .",
    "therefore , it should greatly facilitate designing open - system pcs if each subsystem is independently designed and then all the subsystems are assembled .",
    "such a method has become well established for electrical circuit design .",
    "the behaviors of the electrical energy flows are predicted based on electrical immittance ( impedance and admittance).@xcite two electrical circuits can be assembled without energy reflection at their interface if the electrical immittances of both circuits match .",
    "a complete electrical circuit system can thus be designed after designing each subsystem independently .",
    "em wave media including open - system pcs can be regarded as em wave circuits , for which an analogous figure of merit , em wave immittance , is similarly defined.@xcite it is a ratio of the electric field to the magnetic field of a propagating or decaying wave in a single medium . in practice ,",
    "it has been possible to design one - dimensional ( 1d ) open - system pcs by using the em wave immittance .",
    "particularly notable is that the renormalized fresnel coefficient for a semi - infinite 1d pc with an arbitrary unit cell has been defined using the em wave immittance for bloch waves.@xcite however , there is still difficulty in designing multi - dimensional open - system pcs .",
    "this is because the number of em wave immittances that should be considered at a point on an arbitrarily shaped boundary increases with the number of structural dimensions .",
    "specifically , the immittance of an em wave with a given polarization is expressed as one parameter for a 1d pc , two parameters for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) pc , and six parameters for a three - dimensional ( 3d ) pc .",
    "moreover , each parameter of an em wave immittance is complex in general .",
    "therefore , excessive computational cost would be needed to match every immittance parameter between two multi - dimensional subsystems .    one way to simplify",
    "the matching problem is to reduce the number of parameters by considering structural symmetry .",
    "also , simplifying the parameters themselves is helpful , as has been suggested by boscolo et al.@xcite they pointed out that a propagating wave in a pc line - defect wg has a pure - real immittance on periodic symmetry planes normal to the direction of propagation .",
    "similar findings have been obtained through analytical calculation of the impedance of 1d pcs@xcite and through numerical calculation for 2d pcs.@xcite in this article , we take another approach to simplifying the matching problems  qualitative optimization of individual subsystems .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : proof ] , we first prove that pure - real immittance is a common property of em bloch waves in 1d and 2d pcs , hence it can be used for any 1d or 2d open - system pc .",
    "we also prove that the pure - real property of the immittance is true for 3d periodic structures , but under a limiting condition .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : app ] , we present three examples of designing multi - dimensional open - system pcs . this analysis can be made because the immittance defined by using eigenmodes on the boundary of two semi - infinite regions ( a pc and its external structure ) can be determined from the eigenmodes of an infinite pc and its external structure . in sec .",
    "[ subsec:2dbulk ] , we present a method for qualitatively evaluating the reflection at the surface of a semi - infinite 2d pc ; the approximate availability of the perfect antireflection coating ( arc ) method developed for a semi - infinite 1d pc@xcite to a semi - infinite 2d pc is emphasized .",
    "these semi - infinite 2d pcs can be used for analyzing various applications such as add / drop multiplexers , dispersion compensators , polarization filters , and image processors.@xcite in sec .",
    "[ subsec:2dpcwg ] , we investigate a 2d line - defect wg that efficiently transmits em energy to a channel wg . the semi - infinite 2d pc line - defect wg is a promising platform for ultra - compact photonic circuits.@xcite in sec .",
    "[ subsec:3d ] , we investigate the interface between a semi - infinite channel wg and a semi - infinite 2d pc slab line - defect wg as a typical 3d problem.@xcite all the applications of the proof are presented using the concept of immittance matching . section [ sec : conclusion ] devotes for conclusion .",
    "we begin our description of the proof with a general expression of em bloch waves . assuming time harmonic em waves , the general expression for an em bloch wave ; @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 stand for the band index and bloch wavevector , and functions @xmath3 and @xmath4 have lattice periodicity .",
    "the immittance of a bloch wave is closely related to the energy flow conveyed by the wave ; it is therefore useful to define a complex poynting vector : @xmath5 where the real ( imaginary ) part of @xmath6 is the density of the time - averaged ( reactive ) power flow.@xcite    here , we consider the time reversal state of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : e ] ) and ( [ eqn : h ] ) , which is written as @xmath7 due to the even ( odd ) parity of electric ( magnetic ) field under time reversal operation.@xcite eqs .",

    "next , we consider a poynting vector described using em bloch waves under a reflection operation in infinite 2d pcs .",

    "the non - zero components of em waves in the cartesian coordinate system are @xmath21 for tm and @xmath22 for te polarization.@xcite    accordingly , the poynting vector described using the em bloch wave under reflection operation can be written as @xmath23 on reflection plane @xmath24 , @xmath25 equals @xmath26 . therefore , using eqs .",

    "( [ eqn : imz ] ) means that the immittance is real in infinite 1d and 2d pcs on a plane when the plane is a reflection plane and the bloch wavevector is perpendicular to the plane .",
    "it also means that the reactive power flow is zero for the bloch wave on the plane under consideration . for the case of an infinite 3d pc , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sss ] ) can be written as @xmath31 therefore , an additional reflection plane is required for removing the imaginary part of the impedance .",
    "when there is reflection plane @xmath32 at @xmath33 , some components of the em waves vanish on the plane .",
    "they are called tm- or te - like based on the analogy to infinite 2d pcs .",
    "@xcite in this case , the impedance is real on the intersection line of the @xmath24 and @xmath33 planes .",
    "as a typical application of the above proof , we present a method reducing a reflection loss at the surface of a semi - infinite 2d pc , a semi - infinite 2d pc line - defect wg , and a semi - infinite 2d pc slab line - defect wg based on the concept of the immittance matching .",
    "the method for the immittance matching is extremely simplified since only the real part of immittance function for an infinite pc is needed for the analysis .",
    "the reflection coefficient of a semi - infinite pc should be determined via bloch wave expansion in the semi - infinite pc and the expansion should be described by all the eigen modes of an infinite pc ( i.e. , including decaying waves).@xcite however , here we investigate only the impedance of propagation modes .",
    "this is another merit of our method , that is , it is not necessary to know all the eigenmodes in our method for immittance matching problem .",

    "[ fig : ex1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the incident wave is a normal incident plane wave propagating in vacuum .",

    "note that only the impedance of bloch waves able to couple with an incident plane wave ( `` coupled modes '' ) indicated by `` a '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex1](a ) is plotted .",
    "since the spatial modulation of bands b1 and b2 is flatter than that of bands b4 and b5 and the impedance is near the value in vacuum ( i.e. impedance normalized by vacuum value is near one ) , the reflection loss of bands b1 and b2 at the frequency is lower than that of bands b4 and b5 for the normal incidence of a plane wave . in addition , the flatness of the impedance enables us to reduce the reflection loss by using an antireflection coating ( arc ) method developed for semi - infinite 1d pcs.@xcite in this case , since the plane @xmath24 is a reflection plane , thickness @xmath36 and refractive index @xmath37 of the arc can be estimated using @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the normalized thickness of the arc , @xmath40 is a wavelength in vacuum , @xmath41 is the refractive index of a semi - infinite medium , and @xmath42 for tm polarization . accordingly ,",

    "<S> an electromagnetic ( em ) bloch wave propagating in a photonic crystal ( pc ) is characterized by the immittance ( impedance and admittance ) of the wave . </S>",
    "<S> the immittance is used to investigate transmission and reflection at a surface or an interface of the pc . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the general properties of immittance are useful for clarifying the wave propagation characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> we give a general proof that the immittance of em bloch waves on a plane in infinite one- and two - dimensional ( 2d ) pcs is real when the plane is a reflection plane of the pc and the bloch wavevector is perpendicular to the plane . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the pure - real feature of immittance on a reflection plane for an infinite three - dimensional pc is good approximation based on the numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical proof indicates that the method used for immittance matching is extremely simplified since only the real part of the immittance function is needed for analysis without numerical verification . as an application of the proof , </S>",
    "<S> we describe a method based on immittance matching for qualitatively evaluating the reflection at the surface of a semi - infinite 2d pc , at the interface between a semi - infinite slab waveguide ( wg ) and a semi - infinite 2d pc line - defect wg , and at the interface between a semi - infinite channel wg and a semi - infinite 2d pc slab line - defect wg . </S>"
