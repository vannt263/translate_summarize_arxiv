    "because the gravitational interaction is so weak , a stochastic background of gravitational radiation ( the graviton background ) decouples from the matter in the universe at very early times .",
    "for this reason , the stochastic background of gravitational radiation , which is in principle observable at the present time , carries with it a picture of the state of the universe at very early times , when energy densities and temperatures were very large .",
    "the most interesting features of string theory are associated with its behavior at very high energies , near the planck scale .",
    "such high energies are unobtainable in present - day laboratories , and are unlikely to be reached for quite some time .",
    "they were , however , available during the very early history of the universe , so string theory can be probed by the predictions which it makes about that epoch .",
    "recent work has shown how the early universe might behave , if superstring theories are a correct description of nature @xcite .",
    "one of the robust predictions of this  string cosmology \" is that our present - day universe would contain a stochastic background of gravitational radiation @xcite , with a spectrum which is quite different than that predicted by many other early - universe cosmological models @xcite . in particular , the spectrum of gravitational waves predicted by string cosmology has rising amplitude with increasing frequency .",
    "this means that the radiation might have large enough amplitude to be observable by ground - based gravity - wave detectors , which operate at frequencies above @xmath0 .",
    "this also allows the spectrum to be consistent with observational bounds arising at @xmath1 from observations of the cosmic background radiation and at @xmath2 from observation of millisecond pulsar timing residuals .    in this short paper",
    ", we examine the spectrum of radiation produced by string cosmology , and determine the region of parameter space for which this radiation would be observable by the ( initial and advanced versions of the ) ligo detectors @xcite .",
    "in models of string cosmology @xcite , the universe passes through two early inflationary stages . the first of these",
    "is called the  dilaton - driven \" period and the second is the  string \" phase .",
    "each of these stages produces stochastic gravitational radiation ; the contribution of the dilaton - driven phase is currently better understood than that of the string phase .    in order to describe the background of gravitational radiation",
    ", it is conventional to use a spectral function @xmath3 which is determined by the energy density of the stochastic gravitational waves .",
    "this function of frequency is defined by [ e : defomegagw ] _",
    "gw(f ) = 1 _ critical d _",
    "gw d f. here @xmath4 is the ( present - day ) energy density in stochastic gravitational waves in the frequency range @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the critical energy - density required to just close the universe .",
    "this is given by [ e : crit ] _",
    "critical = 3 c^2 h_0 ^ 2 8 g 1.6 10 ^ -8 h_100 ^ 2 ergs / cm^3 , where the hubble expansion rate @xmath7 is the rate at which our universe is currently expanding , [ e : hubble ] h_0 = h_100 100 = 3.2 10 ^ -18h_100 1 sec .",
    "because @xmath7 is not known exactly , it is defined in terms of a dimensionless parameter @xmath8 which is believed to lie in the range @xmath9 .",
    "the spectrum of gravitational radiation produced in the dilaton - driven and string phase was discussed in @xcite . in the simplest model , which we will use in this paper ,",
    "it depends upon four parameters .",
    "the first pair of these are the frequency @xmath10 and the fractional energy density @xmath11 produced at the end of the dilaton - driven phase .",
    "the second pair of parameters are the maximal frequency @xmath12 above which gravitational radiation is not produced and the maximum fractional energy density @xmath13 , which occurs at that frequency .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : spec ] .",
    "an approximate form for the spectrum is @xcite [ e : approx ] _",
    "gw(f)= where = is the logarithmic slope of the spectrum produced in the string phase .",
    "if we assume that there is no late entropy production and make reasonable choices for the number of effective degrees of freedom , then two of the four parameters may be determined in terms of the hubble parameter @xmath14 at the onset of radiation domination immediately following the string phase of expansion @xcite , f_1= 1.3 10 ^ 10 ( h_r 5 10 ^ 17 ) ^1/2 and _ gw^max = 1 10 ^ -7 h_100 ^ -2 ( h_r 5 10 ^ 17 ) ^2 .",
    "more complicated models and spectra were discussed in @xcite .",
    "the ratios @xmath15 and @xmath16 are determined by the basic physical parameters of string cosmology models , the values of the hubble parameter and the string coupling parameter at the end of the dilaton - driven phase and the onset of the string phase @xcite .",
    "a number of authors @xcite have shown how one can use a network of two or more gravitational wave antennae to detect a stochastic background of gravitational radiation .",
    "the basic idea is to correlate the signals from separated detectors , and to search for a correlated strain produced by the gravitational - wave background , which is buried in the intrinsic instrumental noise .",
    "it has been shown by these authors that after correlating signals for time @xmath17 ( we take @xmath18 ) the ratio of  signal \" to  noise \" ( squared ) is given by an integral over frequency @xmath19 : [ e : sovern ] ( s n ) ^2 = 9 h_0 ^ 4 50 ^4 t _ 0^df .    in order to detect a stochastic background with @xmath20 confidence the ratio @xmath21 needs to be at least @xmath22 . in this equation ,",
    "several different functions appear , which we now define .",
    "the instrument noise in the detectors is described by the one - sided noise power spectral densities @xmath23 .",
    "the ligo project is building two identical detectors , one in hanford washington and one in livingston louisiana , which we will refer to as the  initial \" detectors .",
    "after several years of operation , these detectors will be upgraded to so - called  advanced \" detectors . since the two detectors are identical in design , @xmath24 .",
    "the design goals for the detectors specify these functions @xcite . they are shown in fig .  [",
    "f : noise ] .",
    "the next quantity which appears is the overlap reduction function @xmath25 .",
    "this function is determined by the relative locations and orientations of the arms of the two detectors , and is identical for both the initial and advanced ligo detectors . for the pair of ligo detectors ( f ) = -0.124842 j_0(x ) - 2.90014 + 3.00837 , where the @xmath26 are spherical bessel functions .",
    "the dimensionless frequency variable is @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the light - travel - time between the two ligo detector sites .",
    "this function is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : overlap ]",
    ".    equation ( [ e : sovern ] ) allows us to assess the detectability ( using initial or advanced ligo ) of any particular stochastic background @xmath3 .",
    "making use of the prediction from string cosmology , we may use equation ( [ e : sovern ] ) to assess the detectability of this stochastic background . for",
    "any given set of parameters we may numerically evaluate the signal to noise ratio @xmath29 ; if this value is greater than @xmath22 then with at least 90% confidence , the background can be detected by ligo .",
    "the regions of detectability in parameter space are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : init ] for the initial ligo detectors , and in fig .",
    "[ f : adva ] for the advanced ligo detectors . for these figures",
    "we have assumed @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the observable regions for different values of these parameters can be obtained by simple scaling of the presented results .    at the moment ,",
    "the most restrictive observational constraint on the spectral parameters comes from the standard model of big - bang nucleosynthesis ( ns ) @xcite .",
    "this restricts the total energy density in gravitons to less than that of approximately one massless degree of freedom in thermal equilibrium .",
    "this bound implies that _",
    "gw(f ) d f = _",
    "gw^s < 0.7 10 ^ -5 h^-2_100 . [ nucleo ] where we have assumed an allowed @xmath32 at ns , and have substituted in the spectrum ( [ e : approx ] ) .",
    "this bound is shown on figs .",
    "[ f : init],[f : adva ] .",
    "we also show the weaker  dilaton only \" bound , assuming no stochastic background is produced during the ( more poorly - understood ) string phase of expansion : _",
    "gw^s < 2.1 10 ^ -5 h^-2_100",
    ". this is obtained by setting @xmath33 in the previous equation , i.e. assuming that @xmath34 vanishes for @xmath35 .",
    "we note that if the  dilaton + string \" spectrum is correct , then the ns bounds rule out any hopes of observation by initial ligo . on the other hand , in the  dilaton only \" case , a detectable background is not ruled out by ns bounds ; it would be observable if the spectral peak falls into the detection bandpass between 50 and 200 hz ( figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "because the function @xmath36 decays rapidly at high and low frequencies , the asymptotic behavior of the 90% confidence contours for the advanced ligo detector in the high and low @xmath37 regions can be estimated analytically as follows ( _ gw^s)_90%= 7.4 10 ^ -10 h_100 ^ -2 ( f_s/100 ) ^3 ,  f_s100 ( _ gw^s)_90%= 2.6 10 ^ -11  h_100 ^",
    "-2  ( f_s/20 ) ^0.4 ,  f_s20 similar estimates may be obtained for the initial ligo detector .",
    "in this short paper , we have shown how data from the the initial and advanced versions of ligo will be able to constrain string cosmology models of the early universe . in principle , this might also constrain the fundamental parameters of superstring theory .",
    "the initial ligo is sensitive only to a narrow region of parameter space and is only marginally above the required sensitivity , while the advanced ligo detector has far better detection possibilities .",
    "the simultaneous operation of other types of gravitational wave detectors which operate at higher frequencies , such as bar and resonant designs , ought to provide additional increase in sensitivity and therefore further constrain the parameter space .",
