    "gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) divide into two distinct classes ; long - duration ( @xmath0 ) soft - spectrum bursts ( long grbs ) and short - duration ( @xmath1 ) hard - spectrum bursts ( short grbs ) .",
    "there is mounting evidence from observations of optical afterglows ( ags ) of relatively nearby long duration grbs that they are produced by highly relativistic jets ejected in supernova ( sn ) explosions of massive stars , as long advocated by the cannonball model of grbs ( dar & de rjula  2004 and references therein ) .",
    "however , so far , no optical ag of short grbs has been detected and their origin is still unknown .",
    "the leading scenarios for the origin of short grbs , include , ( a ) merger of neutron - star ( ns ) or black hole ( bh ) binaries ( goodman et al .  1987 ; eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; mochkovitch et al .",
    "1993 ) , ( b ) gravitational collapse of accreting white dwarf ( dar & de rjula  2003;2004 ) , ( c ) gravitational collapse of neutron stars to strange - quark stars ( dar  1999 ) or hyperstars ( dar & de rjula  2000 ) and ( d ) giant flares from soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) in external galaxies ( dado et al .  2005 ; hurley et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "so far , only sgrs are a proven source of short grbs .",
    "sgrs are widely believed to be magnetars : slowly rotating neutron stars with ultra - strong surface magnetic field , @xmath2 misaligned with respect to their rotation axis , which spin down rapidly by magnetic dipole radiation and whose main energy source is their magnetic field energy . in the magnetar model of sgrs ( duncan and thompson  1995 ) ,",
    "crustal instabilities lead occasionally to dissipation of their magnetic energy through large scale magnetic reconnection on their surface , which produce their x - ray and @xmath3-ray flares .",
    "however , the energy release in such events can not exceed the total magnetic field energy , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is their surface magnetic field which is constrained by their spin - down rate , and @xmath6 is the radius of the neutron star ( ns ) . as of today",
    ", about 10 magnetar candidates are known and their @xmath5 field , estimated from their spin down rate , is listed in table 1 . even if the total field energy of such magnetars was released in a single short duration quasi - isotropic flare",
    ", the grb energy could not have exceeded @xmath7    recently , the swift satellite ( e.g. gehrels et al .",
    "2004 ) provided the first rapid and accurate x - ray localization of three short grbs , grb 050509b , grb 050709 and grb 050724 , which lasted @xmath8 their fluences were quite typical of short grbs with durations @xmath9 ms , observed before by batse on board cgro ( paciesas et al .",
    "follow - up optical observations have detected a giant , non - star - forming elliptical galaxy at redshift @xmath10 in the xrt error circle of grb 050509b ( bloom et al .",
    "2005 ) , a bright star - forming galaxy at redshift @xmath11 in the xrt error circle of grb 050709 ( price et al .",
    "2005 ) and a bright elliptical galaxy in the xrt error circle of grb 050724 at @xmath12 ( berger et al .",
    "2005 ) , respectively , with a small chance probability .",
    "if these short grbs were physically associated with these galaxies , then their isotropic equivalent energies , estimated from their redshift distances ( standard cosmology with @xmath13 @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) and measured fluences were ( berger et al .",
    "2005 ) , @xmath16 erg for grb 050509b and @xmath17 erg for grb 050709 and grb 050724 .",
    "they are smaller than the typical isotropic energies of long duration grbs by @xmath18 2 - 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "however , these equivalent isotropic energies are larger than both the equivalent isotropic gamma ray energy , @xmath19 erg , released by the giant flare from sgr 1860 - 20 on december 27 , 2004 ( hurley et al .",
    "2005 ) and the entire magnetic field energy of any known magnetar candidate , by more than 3 orders of magnitude ( see table 1 ) . because magnetars are not expected to produce highly collimated hyper - flares , this has been considered ( e.g gehrels et al .",
    "2005 ) as conclusive evidence against the sgr origin of short grbs at @xmath20    the non detection of a supernova in deep optical images of the host galaxy of grb 050509b taken with large telescopes , such as gemini ( bersier et al .",
    "2005 ) and vlt ( hjorth et al .",
    "2005 ) up to 3 weeks after burst , were used to argue ( hjorth et al .",
    "2005 ) that `` the absence of an sn rules out models predicting a normal snia associated with short grbs '' .",
    "the possible association of grb 050509b and grb 050724 with non - star forming elliptical galaxies was advanced , e.g. , by gehrels et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , by hjorth et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and by berger et al .",
    "( 2005 ) as supporting evidence for the assumption that short grbs are produced by ns - ns or ns - bh mergers , despite the observation that grb 050709 was associated with a star - forming galaxy .",
    "however , in this letter we argue that hyperflares of sgrs may be observed from cosmological distances and can be the main source of the observed short grbs .",
    "the giant flares / bursts from sgr 0526 - 66 on march 5 , 1979 , sgr 1900 + 14 on august 27 , 1998 and sgr 1806 - 20 on december 27 , 2004 consisted of an initial short ( @xmath21 ) spike and a much longer ( @xmath22 ) pulsating tail . while the spikes had quite different intensities and thermal bremsstrahlung spectra ( e.g. , mazets er al .  2005 ; palmer et al .",
    "2005 ) the pulsating tails had similar durations , fluences and black body spectra ( e.g. , mazets et al .",
    "1999 ; hurley et al .",
    "it suggests that , perhaps , the above three bursts / giant flares were similar bursts where the initial spike was generated by the beamed emission of a relativistic jet ( e.g. , by inverse compton scattering of ambient light ) and the differences were mainly because of different viewing angles of the jet , while the similar pulsating tail was a black body surface emission with an enhanced temperature near the polar caps .",
    "the detected radio afterglows from the giant flares of sgr 1900 + 14 ( frail et al .",
    "1999 ) and sgr 1806 - 20 ( cameron et al .  2005 ; gaensler et al .",
    "2005 ) provide additional evidence that relativistic jets are ejected in giant flares of sgrs ( yamazaki et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this letter",
    "we argue that sgrs are not magnetars , but are hyperstars ( dar & re rjula  2000 ) , i.e. ns s where a significant fraction of their neutrons are converting to hyperons or strange quark matter , releasing gravitational binding energy which accumulates and causes eruptions with ejection of collimated bipolar jets along their magnetic axis .",
    "these jets presumably produce the initial short and bright spike of giant flares , which appear as short grbs from cosmological distances .",
    "like in ordinary pulsars , the ejection mechanism of the collimated jets is not clear .",
    "ordinary nuclear matter is made entirely of neutrons and protons which contain only valence @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks .",
    "baryons that contain @xmath25 ( `` strange '' ) quarks , such as @xmath26 and @xmath27 were first discovered in the late 40 s and early 50 s of the last century and were named ` hyperons ' . it was speculated long ago that strange matter made of @xmath28 @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks can be the true ground state of hadronic matter ( bodmer  1971 ; witten  1984 ) and that the interior of neutron - like star consists of such deconfined quarks and not of neutrons .",
    "it was also suggested that there may be no ns s and all neutron - like stars are strange quark stars ( alcock et al .",
    "1986 ) containing approximately equal numbers of deconfined @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks .",
    "even if strange quark matter is not the true ground state of hadronic matter , hyper matter bound by a strong gravitational potential can still be the ground state of nuclear matter in hyperstars ",
    "ns s where a significant fraction of their neutrons have converted to hyperons .",
    "both in ns s and in hyperstars , neutrons and hyperons do not decay because the quantum states of their fermionic decay products are already occupied in the star ( pauli blocking ) .",
    "indeed , simple arguments strongly suggest that slowly - rotating , cold ns s have a critical mass beyond which they collapse to hyperstars which continue to be hyperactive and release gravitational binding energy by gradual contraction , first due to the conversion @xmath29 and later also due to @xmath30 and @xmath31 conversions :    for instance , ignoring first general - relativistic corrections , the radius and central density @xmath32 of a self - gravitating degenerate fermi gas of neutrons of total baryonic mass m and zero angular momentum obtained from a ( postulated ) polytropic ( emden - lane ) solution of the hydrostatic equation are , @xmath33 @xmath34 in this simplest of models , low mass ns should indeed be made of neutrons and a small fraction of protons and electrons to assure stability against their @xmath35 decay , @xmath36 ^ 3              { 3\\ , n_n^2\\over 64\\ , \\pi}\\ , .",
    "\\label{np}\\ ] ] but as m is increased past @xmath37 , @xmath38 increases until the central fermi energy @xmath39 exceeds @xmath40 . at this point",
    ", it is favourable for the strangeness changing weak process @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) to start transforming neutron pairs at the top of the fermi sea into ( initially pressureless ) @xmath43 pairs at the bottom of the sea .",
    "this reduces the pressure , causes contraction and increases @xmath32 , which initiates a run - away strangeness changing reactions which stop only when the balance of chemical potentials of the various species , mainly @xmath44 and @xmath45 guarantees @xmath35 stability .",
    "although this argument is based on newtonian gravity , it is valid also in general relativity because general relativity produces a stronger effective gravity at short distances , i.e. gravity becomes singular at zero distance in newtonian gravity , while in general relativity , it becomes ` infinite ' already at the schwartzchild radius , @xmath46 consequently , it yields larger central densities and enforces the transition to a hyper star .",
    "in general relativity , slowly rotating ns s satisfy the tolman- oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equations ( tolman  1939 ; oppenheimer & volkoff  1939 ) for hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath47\\ , [ m+4\\,\\pi\\ , r^3\\ , p]\\over                             [ r-2\\ , g\\ , m]}\\ , , \\label{tov1}\\ ] ] @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the pressure and total energy density in the star ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 is the gravitational constant and @xmath53 is the gravitational mass inside radius @xmath54 the tov equations set a limit @xmath55 for maximal compact stars , which is much smaller than the radius of a canonical ns .",
    "the actual radius of a compact star is determined by the solutions of the tov equations , which are rather sensitive to the equation of state @xmath56 of baryonic matter at sub - nuclear , nuclear and super nuclear densities and pressures which are below the densities where quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) becomes asymptotically free .",
    "they can not be calculated yet from first principles .",
    "thus , the precise properties of strange quark stars and hyperstars can not yet be predicted reliably enough for establishing their existence from astronomical observations . rather than adopting a specific model",
    ", we will assume that sgrs are hyperstars with a gravitational mass similar to that of canonical ns s , @xmath57 and with a radius significantly smaller than that of ns s , and that their energy source is gravitational contraction induced by the transition from neutron matter to hyper matter .",
    "is there supportive evidence that the slowly rotating sgrs and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are objects much more compact than ordinary ns s ?",
    "the best supportive evidence that the slowly rotating sgrs and axps are hyperstars with a radius significantly smaller than that of ordinary radio pulsars , may come from the black body component of their persistent emission ( dar and de rjula  2000 ) and/or from the redshift of @xmath58 annihilation line if emitted near their surface .",
    "the application of the stefan - boltzman law to their black body emission yields , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the stefan - boltzman constant , and @xmath61 and @xmath62 are , respectively , the stellar effective surface temperature and radius as inferred from measurements of the spectral flux density @xmath63 at a large distance @xmath24 from the star .",
    "the true stellar radius @xmath6 and the effective radius @xmath64 are related through , @xmath65 where @xmath66^{-1}$ ] is the gravitational redshift factor .",
    "unfortunately , the values of @xmath64 which may be extracted from black body fits to accurare spectral energy flux measurements of sgrs and axps in the soft x - ray region ( e.g. by xmm ) are proportional to their uncertain distances and are also sensitive to the extinction along the line of sight .",
    "* grbs from the birth of sgrs / hyperstars : * the total energy release in the transition of an ns to a hyper star is @xmath67 of the gravitational energy release , because @xmath18 half of the gravitational energy release is used to increase the pressure and energy of the fermi gas . the total energy release for , e.g. an emden - lane polytrop is approximately @xmath68 where the transition from an ns with a canonical @xmath69 to a cold hyper star changes its radius from @xmath70 to @xmath71 the typical radius of a hyper star .",
    "most of this internal release of energy can be radiated away in a very short burst of neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the dynamical time scale of the collapse is very short , @xmath72 , yielding a relatively high efficiency of neutrino annihilation to @xmath58 pairs outside the bare hyperstar which can produce a relativistic @xmath73 fireball and a grb with an isotropic energy of @xmath74 ( goodman et al .",
    "such bursts can be seen from @xmath75 distances . however , the birth - rate of sgrs is @xmath76 in our galaxy ( see table 1 ) and @xmath77 within a luminosity distance of @xmath78 assuming that their birth rate is proportional to the star formation rate ( @xmath79 e.g. perez - gonzalez et al .",
    "2005 and references therein ) .",
    "hence , if the birth of sgrs produces grbs , they must be highly collimated , i.e. , produced by highly relativistic bipolar jets , presumably along their magnetic axis , like in core collapse sn explosions . but , sgrs are young pulsars ( see table 1 ) . as such , they may be born inside supernova remnants ( snr ) of core collapse or accretion induced collapse supernovae .",
    "thus , like in the cannonball model of ordinary long grbs ( dar & de rjula  2004 ) , inverse compton scattering of light emitted or scattered by the snr may produce a long grb which is dimmer than ordinary long grbs but is not associated with an sn akin to sn1998bw .",
    "* short grbs from sgrs / hyperstars : * the left over internal thermal energy from the birth of a hyperstar can be radiated over a long time , similar to the cooling time of a newly born ns .",
    "loss of angular momentum by relativistic particle emission along open magnetic lines ( dar and de rjula  2000 ) and cooling reduce the centrifugal and thermal support .",
    "the resulting contraction converts more neutrons to hyperons in internal layers .",
    "the heat released by the gradual phase transition from neutron matter to hyper matter may be radiated continuously or in bursts / flares .",
    "a large energy release in the star from a phase transition in a stellar layer ( neutronization near the crust or hyperonization in more internal layers ) may result in bipolar relativistic jets along the magnetic axis and thermal emission from the surface , which generate a hyper flare .",
    "a large phase transition may take place over a short time comparable to the dynamical time scale of the star ( @xmath80 ) , but the duration of the burst depends both on the duration of the jetted ejection and on the environment of the hyper star .",
    "no doubt , the bursting activity of hyperstars is a very complex phenomenon whose theoretical study will require many more years . at present , only rough estimates of the total energy and the spectral , temporal and angular properties of the initial burst and the following bursting activity can be made .",
    "they will be described in detail elsewhere ( dado , dar and de rjula , in preparation ) .",
    "roughly , the cooling and continuous contraction of a hyperstar can power a total luminosity : @xmath81 for the canonical @xmath82 and @xmath83 a contraction rate of @xmath84 ( a tiny @xmath85 is sufficient to provide the inferred total luminosity , @xmath86 of sgrs and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "but for the explicit numerical coefficient , eq.([lumi ] ) should , on dimensional grounds , be approximately correct in general .",
    "if @xmath87 is the total energy radiated isotropically in the rest frame of a jet moving at an angle @xmath88 relative to the line of sight with a bulk motion lorentz factor @xmath89 ( doppler factor , @xmath90 ) , then doppler boosting and relativistic beaming yield a fluence , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the redshift and @xmath93 is the luminosity distance of the sgr .",
    "the inferred ` equivalent grb isotropic @xmath3-ray energy ' of a grb pulse , is @xmath94 for small viewing angles , @xmath95 and large lorentz factors , @xmath96 , @xmath97 for @xmath98 , it is by far more likely that a beamed grb from a galactic sgr is observed with a viewing angle @xmath99 than with a viewing angle @xmath100 for @xmath101 , eqs .",
    "( [ eiso],[dop ] ) yield @xmath102 thus , if the initial short spike of sgr 1806 - 20 on december 27 , 2004 with @xmath103 was produced by a relativistic jet , which was viewed from an angle @xmath104 , it could have been seen at a redshift @xmath105 as a short grb with an isotropic energy @xmath106 similar to that of the short grbs 050509b , 050709 and 050724 , if its viewing angle was smaller by a factor @xmath18 3 .",
    "note that this is independent of the value of @xmath3 provided that @xmath107",
    "long duration grbs seem to be produced by highly relativistic jets ejected from mass accretion on a proto - neutron star or a black hole in core collapse sn explosions ( see , e.g. dar and de rjula  2004 ) .",
    "they are detected up to very large redshifts .",
    "short duration grbs , if produced by sgrs are much dimmer and are detected from smaller distances where the geometry of the universe is nearly euclidean . in a steady state",
    "euclidean universe , the number @xmath108 of grbs with peak photon fluxes exceeding @xmath49 behaves like @xmath109 independent of beaming , for @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the detection threshold .",
    "cosmic evolution modifies this behaviour for large values of @xmath92 ( low values of @xmath49 ) . if short grbs are relatively much nearer they should deviate less from a @xmath112 behaviour .",
    "presents plots of @xmath108 for the long ( @xmath113 ) and short duration ( @xmath114 ) grbs ( circles ) in the 4-th batse catalog ( paciesas et al .",
    "1999 ) . a small number ( 11 ) of grbs with @xmath115 which can belong to the tail of either one of the two distributions ,",
    "were not included in the plots .",
    "the lines are best fitted power - laws .",
    "the best fitted power - law indices are , @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 with @xmath119 , respectively , compatible with the expectation .",
    "however , the deviation from the @xmath120 law seen in fig .",
    "1 is much larger for long duration grbs than for short duration grbs , consistent with our expectation .",
    "it suggests that the distances of short grbs in the batse 4-th catalog extend up to a much shorter distance than that of long grbs .",
    "* short grbs from cosmological distances may be produced mainly by hyperflares from sgrs , if the initial spike of their hyperflares is highly beamed .",
    "such hyperflares may be the result of phase transitions from neutron matter to hyperon or strange - quark matter in hyperstars .",
    "* the so called ` peak energy ' of short grbs ( @xmath121 at max\\{@xmath122 } ) , in the batse sample ( paciesas et al .",
    "1999 ) is slightly higher than that of long grbs .",
    "however , in the rest frames of their progenitors , they may be quite similar . in the cb model of grbs ( e.g. , dar and de rjula  2004 ) , this suggests similar lorentz factors @xmath3 ( and consequently similar beaming effects ) in short and long grbs .",
    "then , their different luminosities / equivalent isotropic @xmath3-ray energies may result from a smaller baryon number of the jet ejected in a hyperflare and/or a smaller density of the ambient light ( ` glory ' ) near sgrs , than those in long grbs which are produced in sn explosions . *",
    "the shorter duration of the pulses of short grbs relative to long grbs ( mcbreen et al .",
    "2003 ) may result from a smaller scale - height of the ambient light ( glory ) around sgrs . *",
    "although anomalous pulsars ( sgrs and axps ) are very young pulsars ( @xmath123 y ) , and the typical kick velocity of pulsars ( @xmath124 ) is much smaller than the typical velocity of the spherical ejecta in sn explosions , only a fraction of them are found within / near young snrs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this indicate that sgrs may be born not only in core collapse sn explosions but also in , e.g. accretion induced collapse of white dwarfs .",
    "this may explain why short grbs are produced both in elliptical galaxies with old stellar populations and in star - forming spiral galaxies with young stellar populations .",
    "* finally , the rate of hyperflares from galactic sgrs ( @xmath125 ) is much larger than the estimated rate of ns - ns and ns - bh mergers in the galaxy ( @xmath126 ) ( kalogera et al .",
    "2004 ) . in the cb model",
    ", it makes sgrs a much more likely source of short grbs than ns - ns or ns - bh merger .",
