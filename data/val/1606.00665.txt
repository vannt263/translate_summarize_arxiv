    "over the last 40 years the role of the neutrino in nature has been studied and understood via observations of neutrinos from the sun , extragalactic supernovae and cosmic rays .",
    "the picture that has emerged has been corroborated by observations of neutrinos from nuclear reactors and particle accelerators .",
    "the neutrino has turned out to be a much more complicated physical system than most elementary particles .",
    "many kinds of neutrinos and antineutrinos are now known to exist and transformations among them can now explain many of the odd features noted in the observations .    it is frequently convenient to label neutrinos by their properties under the charged current weak interaction . under the influence of the charged current",
    "the neutrino will turn into a charged particle , a lepton .",
    "the kind of charged particle produced by the interaction is then used to label the kind of neutrino . if a negatively charged electron , muon or tau is produced the neutrino is regarded to be an electron , muon or tau neutrino .",
    "an antineutrino would produce a positively charged lepton .",
    "nuclear reactions in the sun produce electron neutrinos .",
    "cosmic ray interactions in the earth s atmosphere produce a mixture of muon and electron neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "this paper discusses the history of the discovery of what was known as the `` atmospheric neutrino anomaly '' .",
    "this effect is widely regarded as one of the strongest bits of experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations and hence a neutrino mass .",
    "i will frequently use the terms neutrino mixing and neutrino oscillations interchangeably since oscillations require mixing .",
    "neutrino mass _ differences _ are also required for the mixing to manifest itself as a time and distance dependent variation in the neutrino properties , an oscillation .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos are neutrinos , which are produced by cosmic ray interactions in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "cosmic rays interact strongly to produce pions , kaons and other unstable particles by collision .",
    "the decay of these produced particles yields muons , the most common component of cosmic rays at ground level .",
    "the decays also produce neutrinos which , until the period involved here , were very difficult to observe@xcite .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino anomaly refers to the fact that the muon neutrino flux of atmospheric neutrinos is substantially lower than the expected value .",
    "it has many similarities to the solar neutrino problem , in that the neutrinos were observed in nature and the observations were well below expectation .",
    "the modern view is that the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino problem are closely related via the phenomena of three flavor neutrino oscillations .",
    "the time period of this paper is primarily 1978 to 1988 .",
    "some issues of the state of physics prior to 1978 are reviewed to set the stage for the events that followed .",
    "the early and mid 1970 s was a very productive period for particle physics .",
    "electro - weak unification , quantum chromodynamics , grand unified theories , supersymmetry and their experimental underpinnings were all developed in this period .",
    "string theories also became well established during the 1978 - 1988 period of our story .",
    "among the significant issues in neutrino physics in the mid 1970 s were a number of `` discoveries '' which have since been resolved and were ultimately not confirmed .",
    "scientific discovery is rarely linear and this section describes reports that could have been central to the issue of neutrino mixing , but many of them were ultimately tangential .",
    "the goal of this section is to put the subsequent story into its historical context .",
    "the weak neutral current is the interaction that permits neutrinos to interact without changing into a charged lepton .",
    "it is rarely relevant in nuclear and particle decays since the much stronger electromagnetic interaction can do these more rapidly .",
    "the weak neutral current was first observed in accelerator neutrino beams .    the discovery of the weak neutral current ( which turned out to be true ) involved considerable uncertainty@xcite .",
    "this uncertainty has become known in the field as `` alternating neutral currents '' , since the reports of discovery came and went and then returned . in fairness to those authors one should emphasize that doing a careful job is frequently inconsistent with making a dramatic discovery . to rush such checks can lead to uncovering evidence that both supports and refutes a conclusion . as each piece of evidence",
    "is analyzed the `` conclusions '' may change .",
    "if one does many checks the conclusions can change many times .",
    "the high y anomaly@xcite was also a significant contributor to what would follow .",
    "this disagreement of observed kinematic distributions ( the @xmath0 variable , the fraction of the initial neutrino energy carried by the final state muon ) for ( anti)neutrino interactions at high energy with expectations , was taken by some as evidence for right handed currents .",
    "a neutrino mass would provide a natural source for right handed currents .",
    "such currents helped motivate the possibility of neutrino oscillations in the mid 1970 s .",
    "subsequent experiments failed to support the presence of the high y discrepancy .",
    "some evidence for the violation of the muon number and electron number conservation was found in the decay @xmath1.@xcite ( the symbol @xmath2 represents the muon , @xmath3 the electron and @xmath4 a gamma ray . ) in such a decay muon number decreases and electron number increases but the total remains constant .",
    "the concepts of muon number , electron number and tau number had been introduced to explain the absence of transitions not forbidden by any other known conservation law .",
    "the concept declared that each of the leptons contained a unique property that was conserved in all interactions .",
    "the charged lepton and its corresponding neutrino shared this property .",
    "the concept of lepton number explains , for example why the two neutrinos produced in muon decay @xmath5 had to have different flavors .",
    "the decay @xmath1 is forbidden since both the muon number and the electron number change by one unit .",
    "the existence of the decay @xmath1 would remove a constraint that prevented neutrinos from mixing . ultimately the evidence for the decay @xmath1 was not confirmed .",
    "searches for this lepton number violating decay continue today .",
    "direct kinematic evidence for a neutrino mass was published by a soviet group under lubimov@xcite .",
    "lubimov had used the classic method of studying the high energy end of the tritium beta decay spectrum with a precision spectrometer .",
    "a neutrino mass would produce distortion of the end point since a mass would limit the phase space for the highest energy electrons from this beta decay .",
    "( their maximum kinetic energy would be lower since some of the decay energy would appear as the neutrino mass . ) at the time the previous best upper bound on the neutrino mass was 60 ev using a similar method@xcite . from 1980",
    "onward there was unrefuted evidence from this group for a neutrino mass of from 30 - 40 ev .",
    "it took at least a decade of effort to eventually show this result was in error .",
    "currently there is no established value for the neutrino mass , only upper limits . though observations do support the existence of neutrino mass differences .    a novel method of searching for neutrino flavor transformations yielded some evidence for oscillations in 1979@xcite .",
    "the concept was a good one .",
    "use the neutral current interaction of neutrinos on deuterium to measure the neutrino flux and use the charged current interaction on the same deuterium to measure the electron neutrino content at the same time .",
    "the nuclear reactor source of neutrinos only makes electron type antineutrinos .",
    "these are of too low an energy to have charged current interactions if they transform into muon or tau neutrinos . but the transformed neutrinos would still have neutral current interactions .",
    "so the neutral current observations measured the total neutrino content and the charged current interactions measured only the electron type neutrinos . if the two measurements did not agree some of the electron neutrinos had been transformed .",
    "this in fact , was the method used by the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) to resolve the solar neutrino puzzle .",
    "( the sno group used the charged current neutrino reaction on deuterium @xmath6 to measure the electron neutrino content of the solar flux .",
    "they used the neutral current reaction @xmath7 to measure the flux of all types of neutrinos independently of the neutrino type . )",
    "careful checks ultimately indicated that the conclusions of pasierb _",
    "et al._@xcite that neutrinos had transformed were in error .    the period of the 1970 s had many exciting neutrino observations which inspired subsequent work .",
    "many of these including the high y anomaly , @xmath1 , the lubimov neutrino mass and the pasierb neutrino oscillations turned out not to hold up .",
    "others , such as the weak neutral current , survived an ambiguous origin to become cornerstones of modern particle physics .      while it is often assumed that the solar neutrino problem provided strong motivation to study neutrino oscillations i think this is not true .",
    "there were three possible explanations for the solar neutrino problem , and until the discovery of the mikheyev - smirnov@xcite effect in 1985 , neutrino oscillations was the least popular . both the nuclear chemistry method used for the initial observations and the obscure branch of the solar reaction model needed to produce the energetic neutrinos needed for that detection method were also suspect .",
    "the mikheyev - smirnov@xcite effect , also known as msw , permitted large neutrino flavor changes from small neutrino mixing due to contributions of the neutrino electron charged current to the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "when traversing matter electron type neutrinos had an additional interaction with the electrons in the matter .",
    "this interaction , under certain conditions , can enhance neutrino oscillations .",
    "the msw effect became better known in the west due to the work of bethe@xcite in 1986 .",
    "a number of incidents were instrumental in focusing attention on the neutrino oscillations@xcite question .",
    "the discovery of the @xmath8 lepton@xcite clearly indicated our knowledge of the lepton sector was incomplete .",
    "thinking at the time was that such a charged lepton should be accompanied by a neutral _ massless _ partner , the @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath8 lepton was the first clear evidence for a third family .",
    "the presence of three distinct neutrino types significantly expanded the phenomenology of neutrino oscillations@xcite .",
    "in particular the number of parameters to describe neutrino oscillations would rise to 4 angles , from the one needed when only two families were present .",
    "the work of kobayashi and maskawa@xcite had also made it clear that there was now enough structure in the lepton sector to permit the presence of cp violation , a very rare phenomenon at the time .",
    "( cp violation is a manifest difference in the properties of matter and antimatter .",
    "kobayashi and maskawa had pointed out that a physical theory needed three particle families , if it was to have enough degrees of freedom for the phenomena of cp violation to manifest itself .",
    "they built upon the work of cabibbo@xcite who pointed out that nuclear beta decay via the weak charged current could be understood as a transition involving a superposition of the d quark , normally found in protons and neutrons , with the much rarer strange quark . )",
    "the mann and primakoff paper@xcite stimulated a good deal of research .",
    "for example , considerations of the effect of bulk matter on neutrino transport@xcite were contemplated in response to the suggestion in@xcite that one would want 1,000 kilometer long neutrino beams slicing through a cord of the earth .",
    "a number of existing neutrino experiments were modified to make them more accessible to observing neutrino oscillations .",
    "figure [ fig : mp ] shows the title and abstract from this paper@xcite .",
    "another issue in this period that contributed to the interest in neutrino oscillations was the general maturation of accelerator based neutrino physics .",
    "what had been an exotic and difficult program to create tertiary neutrino beams had come to fruition at most of the major high energy physics labs .",
    "the presence of such facilities made it much easier to take the next step in the study of neutrino properties .",
    "the interferometry method embodied in neutrino oscillations gave one high energy accelerator based access to neutrino mass scales of the order of electron volts .",
    "neutrino oscillations are essentially an interferometric effect .",
    "( multiple amplitudes lead to the same state and the amplitudes can interfere ) .",
    "the initial neutrino flavor state is a particular superposition of the neutrino mass states . since the different neutrino mass states evolve in time at different rates an initially pure flavor state will turn into a superposition of flavor states at a future time .",
    "measuring the flavor content as a function of time gives one access to both the degree of neutrino mixing , via the magnitude of the impurity , and the neutrino mass differences scale , by when the flavor variation emerges and reaches a maximum in time .",
    "a second source of inspiration came from the very rapid progress in theoretical physics in the early 1970 s .",
    "nonabellian gauge theories as part of the standard model started to appear to play a role in nature .",
    "the discovery of weak neutral currents provided experimental support for electro - weak unification , in the context of a gauge theory .",
    "asymptotic freedom@xcite , the weakening of the strong interactions at high energy , the dynamics underlying quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) was discovered . with the running of the strong interaction coupling constant",
    "came the possibility that at some momentum it would meet the electro - weak value and grand unified theories@xcite ( guts ) were created .",
    "these theories combined three forces of nature into one large group and demonstrated how the underlying distinctions would emerge at normal energies . at some high energy , called the unification scale , all the interactions would be identical , with the same interaction strength . at lower energies the coupling constants and selection rules would diverge to form , what appear to be three distinct forces of nature .",
    "such unification was not without cost .",
    "rather quickly it was realized that some of the additional interactions present in grand unified theories would lead to new , rare phenomena@xcite , such as the decay of the proton to leptons and mesons .",
    "the final state of proton decay would conserve electric charge , angular momentum or spin and energy but it would not conserve the values of baryon number or lepton number .",
    "the theory was not in conflict with observation since the lifetime predicted was still several orders of magnitude longer than experimental limits on proton decay at the time .",
    "the possibility of experimental confirmation of grand unified theories via the observation of proton decay became a goal of late 1970 s to early 1990 s particle physics and is still important today .",
    "no convincing evidence has been reported for proton instability .",
    "even now , the best we have are upper limits on its lifetime .",
    "the story of how technical problems were solved to reduce costs such that massive detectors capable of making interesting measurements of the proton lifetime is a long one that we can not discuss here .",
    "a recent talk@xcite outlines how the major design decisions were made in the period 1978 - 1979 and the first detectors constructed by 1982 .",
    "much of the work described in the current paper took place in the context of a collaboration centered at the university of california at irvine , the university of michigan and brookhaven national laboratory , known as imb .",
    "the collaboration was formed in early 1979 to construct a massive deep underground detector ( eventually built near cleveland , ohio ) to discover proton decay .",
    "the irvine group included many of the co - discoverers of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "figure [ fig : imb - sketch-1 ] is a sketch of the detector used for this research .",
    "reference @xcite describes the search for proton decay and includes photographs and other illustrations of the methods employed .",
    "most early grand unified theories predicted that the proton would decay to a final state consisting of a positron and a neutral pion .",
    "the neutral pion would immediately decay to two photons giving a fairly clear signal .",
    "some variations of the theories , including those incorporating supersymmetry predicted suppression of this decay mode but favored a decay mode containing a charged muon and a neutral k meson .",
    "the neutral k meson would also decay yielding a somewhat different signature .",
    "some ability to distinguish the proton decay modes was an essential part of the experiments .",
    "an experiment searching for rare processes such as proton decay must be very sensitive .",
    "a sensitive detector is subject to a very large number of detections of non - signal .",
    "such non - signal is termed `` background '' .",
    "a proton decay detector needs to be very large to be sensitive to the signal but it must be well shielded to reduce the background to a level where it does not obscure the signal .",
    "all such low background experiments have been located underground since cosmic rays produce a substantial contribution to the background at the surface .",
    "even underground the cosmic ray rate is at best reduced but never eliminated .",
    "this is because the high energy muon component of the surface cosmic rays interact primarily electromagnetically and so they loose energy fairly slowly in traversing matter . as a rule , the deeper the detector the fewer cosmic ray muons one must register and reject .",
    "one important trade - off is that excavation costs are higher the deeper one goes .",
    "so on a fixed budget one would have to construct a smaller detector at larger depths .",
    "in most cases the location of the underground laboratory has been determined by previously existing infrastructure such as a mine or mountain tunnel .",
    "one form of non - signal , background , which is not attenuated by depth are interactions from the neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere . a very efficient method for producing neutrinos in the atmosphere is by strong interaction production of pions .",
    "the pions decay readily to a muon and a muon neutrino .",
    "many of the muons also decay before they reach the ground to yield an electron and two additional neutrinos ( one each of electron and muon type ) .",
    "neutrinos are very penetrating since they only interact via the weak interaction , so they are essentially unattenuated by any amount of terrestrial shielding .",
    "the flux of these neutrinos can be calculated and an event rate estimated .",
    "the experimental challenge was to identify neutrino interactions so that they could not be confused with the proton decay signature . in principle",
    "it would be easy to distinguish the two .",
    "protons decayed essentially at rest in the detector , with negligible momentum whereas entering neutrinos bring momentum , creating events with approximately equal energy and momentum .",
    "so one can distinguish the two classes of events by reconstructing the events and measuring their momentum .",
    "the search for neutrino oscillations was begun most expeditiously by adapting existing facilities to the project . once existing data had been checked , and no evidence for oscillations found , the next step was to try to extend the range of the searches .",
    "one project , experiment 704 ( figure [ fig:704e ] ) at brookhaven , utilized a neutrino detector that had been used to establish the properties of the weak neutral current@xcite . to extend its sensitivity to neutrino oscillations the energy of the beam was lowered .",
    "lowering the neutrino beam energy had several advantages .",
    "it extended the sensitivity to lower neutrino mass differences ( @xmath10 ) . at the lower energies the muon neutrinos in the beam would not interact because they had insufficient center of mass energy to produce a muon via the charged current interaction .",
    "interactions could only occur if the muon neutrinos transformed into electron neutrinos .",
    "lowering the production energy also had the advantage that no electron neutrinos were produced in the target since the beam was below kaon production threshold .",
    "kaons are the major source of the electron neutrino content of accelerator based neutrino beams .",
    "the experiment failed to find evidence for neutrino oscillations but gave the experimenters , many of whom went on to work on imb , substantial experience with the neutrino oscillations problem . among the lessons learned was a need for a good understanding of the neutrino flux and a very good understanding of the detector response to a potential oscillations signal .",
    "figure [ fig:704 ] shows many of the participants in this early oscillations experiment .",
    "while the flux of atmospheric neutrinos was an annoyance to the search for proton decay , it was realized that such a signal also provided an opportunity to extended the study of neutrino oscillations to kinematic regions of mass differences , @xmath10 well below what would be feasible at accelerators or reactors . but",
    "to be effective the detector would have to be able to distinguish between different kinds of neutrino interactions .",
    "fortunately the need to identify the proton decay final state to distinguish different models had similar requirements .",
    "the imb detector@xcite was designed with a high resolution time scale to facilitate reconstruction by time of flight and a coarse time resolution which extended out to 10 microseconds following an event to search for a delayed signal coming from a final state muon , @xmath5 ( figure [ fig : t2 ] ) .",
    "this coarse time scale , or second time scale was known as the `` t2 '' scale and was to later give the name `` t2 problem '' to our discovery .",
    "the name came about since we failed to find sufficient event candidates within a delayed time window .",
    "these were measured with the `` t2 '' electronics . a potential problem with this part of the electronics",
    "would give a comparable result .",
    "fortunately there were experimental ways to confirm the correct operation of the electronics , by measuring stopping muons penetrating from the surface .",
    "so we could rule out an instrumentation problem to explain the observations .",
    "but the name stuck .    while massive shielded underground detectors were motivated , and funded initially to experimentally observe predictions of grand unified theories , it is noteworthy that even the earliest proposals@xcite clearly indicated that such detectors would also be able to explore `` neutrino oscillations , matter effects and supernovae '' .",
    "the groups active in the search for proton decay , for the most part , had substantial neutrino experience since the problems were similar in many ways .",
    "neutrino observation also required massive well shielded detectors .    while the imb proposal@xcite had mentioned neutrino oscillations the details",
    "were not filled in until spring of 1980 . as part of the graduate school requirements at harvard university",
    ", students were expected to prepare a project on a topic related to their thesis research and to present it as an oral exam .",
    "bruce cortez , a student of larry sulak , chose atmospheric neutrino oscillations as his qualifying orals topic@xcite .",
    "his work was fairly complete .",
    "it included details of the neutrino flight distance as a function of direction .",
    "upward going neutrinos travel about 13,000 km but those going down only travel about 15 km from their point of production in the atmosphere .",
    "the neutrino direction is determined from the direction of the momentum of the reconstructed neutrino interaction .",
    "though , in principle one got all of the distances in between the transition from up to down distance scales occurs very rapidly over a fairly small part of the total solid angle near the horizon so , in essence one was dealing with an approximately 2 distance neutrino experiment . the correlation of neutrino direction , with the direction reconstructed from the final states was studied . for most neutrino events",
    "the reconstructed direction of the outgoing muon or electron provides a reasonable estimate of the neutrino direction ( and hence path length ) but this concordance tends to be less reliable at lower energies . fortunately the problem does not prevent telling up from down .",
    "the work showed that for about two orders of magnitude @xmath10 , from below 10@xmath11 ev@xmath12 to about 10@xmath13 ev@xmath12 one would have a very clear difference in the electron to muon ratio measured for upward events compared to the observed value for downward events .",
    "the downward events provided a short range sample to which the long range upward going events could be compared .",
    "figures prepared for this work also showed a substantial distortion in the neutrino spectra if @xmath10 were in a range just below or just above the one where the effect would be maximal .    the title page for sulak s talk about the potential to observe the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos presented at the 1980 eps meeting in erice , sicily.,width=624 ]    the cortez oral work was documented in a number of conference talks@xcite .",
    "figures [ fig : erice ] and [ fig : fwogu ] are the title pages from some of these talks .",
    "figures taken from the fwogu and erice talks illustrating the method to observe atmospheric neutrino oscillations with a detector that was already under construction to observe proton decay .",
    "the neutrino propagation distances and the neutrino energy spectrum are shown here.,height=720 ]    figures taken from the fwogu and erice talks illustrating the method to observe atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the neutrino energy and direction resolution are considered here.,height=720 ]    the expected ratio of electron neutrino interactions to muon neutrino interactions for those neutrinos going upward and those going downward plotted as a function of the ( positive ) neutrino mass difference .",
    "the difference between these two samples is sensitive to neutrino oscillations over a substantial range of mass differences.,height=576 ]    figures [ fig : anoa ] and [ fig : anob ] summarize most of the information needed to study atmospheric neutrino oscillations including the neutrino flux and cross sections , the variable distances and resolution issues .",
    "figure [ fig : ano2 ] emphasizes the primary observable would be a difference in the electron to muon neutrino interaction rate as a function of neutrino direction .",
    "so the atmospheric neutrino sample collected in the detector would include neutrinos with both short and long travel distances .",
    "comparison of these samples would provide evidence for neutrino oscillations .",
    "the short ones would provide a control sample of unmodified neutrinos that could be compared with the longer flight ones which could have oscillated over the extra flight time .",
    "detector construction took up much of the period of 1980 - 1981 . a first attempt to fill the detector",
    "was made in december 1981 .",
    "some flaws in design were discovered at that time but even the partial fill yielded important data on the detector performance . a memo@xcite ( figure [ fig : t2memo ] ) from early 1982 demonstrated the detector response to stopping comic ray muons even though only 1/3 of the detector had been filled .",
    "the particle identification system , the `` t2 '' scale was validated .",
    "muons from the surface stopped in the partially filled detector gave the expected delayed signal about 2 microseconds after they had stopped .",
    "timing and energy distributions met expectations .",
    "the muons triggered the detector when they entered it .",
    "the subsequent muon decay populated the delayed time scale electronics .",
    "heading from a 1982 internal report on calibrating the detector response to muon decays .",
    "this work was done well before the detector was completed , width=480 ]    a substantial effort was made during the initial start - up period to understand the detector .",
    "one had to demonstrate that the device saw what was expected to be there , atmospheric neutrinos and cosmic ray muons , before one could believe that it was also capable of observing proton decay .    since the atmospheric neutrinos were expected to be the only serious background to proton decay several efforts were made to control systematic errors associated with them .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino response in the detector was modeled using real neutrino interactions .",
    "we had access to the large sample of accelerator neutrino interactions acquired at cern in the heavy liquid bubble chamber `` gargamelle '' .",
    "these interactions were primarily on bromine , a slightly heavier nucleus than the oxygen found in our water .",
    "but we needed a sample of neutrino interactions on nuclei since these would include absorption , rescattering and fermi motion effects caused by the other nucleons in the nucleus .",
    "subsequent to the work with the `` gargamelle '' events we also studied events on neon from brookhaven and on deuterium from argonne .",
    "several neutrino interaction models were also prepared to facilitate comparison and gauge systematic error .",
    "the experiment was fortunate in that it had access to a large convenient sample of stopping muons to calibrate the detector response to muon decay .    in a memo of summer 1983@xcite ( figure [ fig : disc ] )",
    "bill foster described the way in which `` gargamelle '' events were converted to imb events and were simulated to understand the background .",
    "that note has a very interesting concluding paragraph .",
    "`` it has come to my attention that the electron angular distribution from @xmath14 decay are backwards ( for muons from neutrinos ) on this tape .",
    "this may have an effect on the fraction of observable @xmath15 decays , which bruce says is somewhat higher than the data .",
    "this may be corrected in a future release when i get back from paris . ''",
    "the simulation had more muon decay events than had been observed in the detector .",
    "this became know as the `` t2 problem '' .",
    "something needed to be understood .",
    "the search was on to find some systematic error that could account for the discrepancy .",
    "as the quote indicates , the muon polarization was considered a possible candidate for the cause .",
    "the physical significance of this remark is that the spin direction of muons coming from neutrino interactions is opposite that of muons coming from pion decay .",
    "the calibration response based on stopped muon decays could be slightly different than the detector response to muons formed by neutrino interactions .",
    "the september 1983 harvard phd .",
    "theses of bruce cortez and bill foster@xcite contained the first physics to emerge from the class of experiments initiated to discover proton decay .",
    "their data sample consisted of 112 contained events collected over a period of 130 days .",
    "they had searched for proton decay into the decay modes , lepton @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "no evidence for proton decay had been found .",
    "the data sample included 25 events which had a muon decay .",
    "this was 22@xmath184% of the sample when 33% had been expected .",
    "this muon deficit , which was 2.5 standard deviations too low , was the net result of the discrepancy mentioned at the end of the previous section .",
    "followup of this `` t2 problem '' came with work by eric shumard , summarized in his 1984 phd .",
    "thesis@xcite for the university of michigan .",
    "a major portion of shumard s thesis was devoted to extensive study of the imb detector s response to muon decay .",
    "he did a very careful job of measuring and modeling the muon identification process .",
    "he included all effects such a muon polarization , absorption , reflections of light and after - pulsing of phototubes .",
    "the thesis was based on 148 contained events collected over 202 days .",
    "the sample included 39 events with muon decays , which was 26.4@xmath183.6% but 35% of the sample , 52 events , were expected .",
    "shumard had succeeded in improving the responsiveness of the detector to muon decays , and hence the ability to recognize muon neutrino interactions .",
    "but in spite of this effort the observations were still about 2.4 standard deviations below expectations .    as was typical at the time , the topic of shumard s phd .",
    "thesis was proton decay .",
    "he also reported no evidence for this process .",
    "the imb-1 detector ran for 417 days of live time before undergoing modifications to what eventually became imb-3 .",
    "the raw data from imb was analyzed twice , by two independent programs to increase the detection efficiency and to guard against potential systematic bias .",
    "one of these streams was based at caltech and irvine and was known as the `` west coast '' analysis .",
    "the october , 1985 caltech phd .",
    "thesis of geoff blewitt@xcite included 326 contained events , from only the `` west coast '' version of the reconstruction streams .",
    "he reported a muon decay rate that was 2.8 standard deviations too low .",
    "the full imb-1 data sample consisted of a merger of both analyses .",
    "it had 401 contained events . of these 104",
    "had a muon decay .",

    "as part of the effort to understand the background to proton decay there were extensive efforts to understand the details of neutrino interactions and their final states .",

    "the reason for mentioning the s type event rate above 100 mev is that muon decay from sub threshold muons could look like showering low energy electron events .",

    "the kamiokande i detector was capable of recording delayed muon decays associated with an event .",

    "only 59% of the expected number of muon type events were observed .",
    "the hirata _",

    "the course of scientific discovery , is rarely straight , there are a number of subtleties associated with the measurements .",
    "personal notes written in the 1988 - 1989 period indicate serious concern about the event rates reported in the hirata _ et al._@xcite paper .",
    "kamiokande 1 had reported an event rate of 116@xmath1810 events per kiloton - year but the new paper based on combining this data with subsequent data had an event rate of 92.3@xmath185.7 per kiloton - year ( figure [ fig : drop ] ) .",
    "one can understand that the m / s numbers changed from earlier reports because the m / s fitting method had been revised but why should the event rate drop ? the 2.87 kiloton - year in the paper was the sum of the 1.11 kiloton - year from kamiokande i and 1.76 kiloton - year from kamiokande ii . by subtraction",
    "this means that kamiokande ii had 136 events in 1.76 kiloton - years or an event rate of 77.3@xmath186.8 events / ktonyr , a drop of 38% from kamiokande 1 .",
    "portion of the 1989 letter from the kamiokande collaboration which argues that the rate difference is not significant .",

    "apparently the event rate per kiloton - year was expected to be lower in kamiokande ii.,height=576 ]    after discussing the rate change with kamioka investigators at conferences they suggested that i write to the collaboration .",
    "an email@xcite was sent on april 18 , 1989 and a written reply dated august 12 , 1989 came by post .",
    "the response@xcite ( figure [ fig : kamr ] ) indicated that a refit of kamiokande i had an event rate of 116@xmath189.4 events / ktonyr , in good agreement with my estimates .",
    "they also indicated that both kamiokande i and kamiokande ii had rates in agreement with expectations .",
    "it would have been nice to see the muon neutrino fraction independently for these two exposures , kamiokande i and ii .",

    "scientists are often expected to draw solid conclusions from incomplete data , while maintaining an open mind .",
    "perhaps the best remedy for this conflict is redundancy and honest corroboration .",
    "in contrast to many of the issues mentioned in the introduction the atmospheric neutrino anomaly turned out to be true and is an important window on beyond the standard model physics . the full story of the discovery is more complex than can be covered in this already long article .",

    "<S> the modern picture of the neutrino as a multiple mass highly mixed neutral particle has emerged over 40 years of study . </S>",
    "<S> best known of the issues leading to this picture was the apparent loss of neutrinos coming from the sun . </S>",
    "<S> this article describes another piece of evidence that supports the picture ; the substantial reduction of high energy muon type neutrinos observed in nature . for much of the 40 year period , before the modern picture emerged this observation was known as the `` atmospheric neutrino anomaly '' , since as will be seen , these neutrinos originate in the earth s atmosphere .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper describes the discovery of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> we explore the scientific context and motivations in the late 1970 s from which this work emerged . the gradual awareness that the observations of atmospheric neutrinos were not as expected took place in the 1983 - 1986 period . </S>"
