    "the texono collaboration@xcite has been built up since 1997 to initiate and pursue an experimental program in neutrino and astroparticle physics@xcite .",
    "the collaboration comprises more than 40 research scientists from major institutes / universities in taiwan ( academia sinica@xmath4 , chung - kuo institute of technology , institute of nuclear energy research , national taiwan university , national tsing hua university , and kuo - sheng nuclear power station ) , china ( institute of high energy physics@xmath4 , institute of atomic energy@xmath4 , institute of radiation protection , nanjing university , tsing hua university ) and the united states ( university of maryland ) , with as , ihep and iae ( with @xmath4 ) being the leading groups .",
    "it is the first research collaboration of this size and magnitude among scientists from taiwan and china@xcite .",
    "results from recent neutrino experiments strongly favor neutrino oscillations which imply neutrino masses and mixings  @xcite . their physical origin and experimental consequences",
    "are not fully understood .",
    "there are strong motivations for further experimental efforts to shed light on these fundamental questions by probing standard and anomalous neutrino properties and interactions .",
    "the results can constrain theoretical models which will be necessary to interpret the future precision data . in addition , these studies would also explore new detection channels to open up new avenues of investigations .",
    "the texono research program is based on the the unexplored and unexploited theme of adopting detectors with high - z nuclei , such as solid state device and scintillating crystals , for low - energy low - background experiments in neutrino and astroparticle physics@xcite .",
    "the main effort is a reactor neutrino experiment at the kuo - sheng ( ks ) nuclear power station in taiwan to study low energy neutrino properties and interactions@xcite .",
    "the kuo - sheng experiment is the first particle physics experiment in taiwan . in parallel to the reactor experiment , various r&d efforts coherent with the theme are initiated and pursued .",
    "subsequent sections highlight the results and status of the program .",
    "the `` kuo - sheng neutrino laboratory '' is located at a distance of 28  m from the core # 1 of the kuo - sheng nuclear power station at the northern shore of taiwan@xcite .",
    "a schematic view is depicted in figure  [ ksnpssite]a .",
    "a multi - purpose `` inner target '' detector space of 100  @xmath580  @xmath575  cm is enclosed by 4@xmath6 passive shielding materials which have a total weight of 50 tons .",
    "the shielding provides attenuation to the ambient neutron and gamma background , and consists of , from inside out , 5  cm of ofhc copper , 25  cm of boron - loaded polyethylene , 5  cm of steel , 15  cm of lead , and cosmic - ray veto scintillator panels .",
    "the schematic layout of one side is shown in figure  [ ksnpssite]b .",
    "different detectors can be placed in the inner space for the different scientific goals .",
    "the detectors are read out by a versatile electronics and data acquisition systems@xcite based on a 16-channel , 20  mhz , 8-bit flash analog - to - digital - convertor  ( fadc ) module .",
    "the readout allows full recording of all the relevant pulse shape and timing information for as long as several ms after the initial trigger .",
    "software procedures have been devised to extend the effective dynamic range from the nominal 8-bit measurement range provided by the fadc@xcite .",
    "the reactor laboratory is connected via telephone line to the home - base laboratory at as , where remote access and monitoring are performed regularly .",
    "data are stored and accessed via the pc ide - bus from a cluster of multi - disks arrays each with 800  gbyte of memory .",
    "the measure - able nuclear and electron recoil spectra due to reactor @xmath7 are depicted in figure  [ spectra ] , showing the effects due to standard model [ @xmath8 and magnetic moment [ @xmath9 @xmath7-electron scatterings@xcite , as well as the standard model neutrino coherent scatterings on the nuclei [ @xmath10 .",
    "it was recognized recently@xcite that due to the uncertainties in the modeling of the low energy part of the reactor neutrino spectra , experiments to measure @xmath11 with reactor neutrinos should focus on higher electron recoil energies ( t@xmath121.5  mev ) , while @xmath13 searches should base on measurements with t@xmath14100  kev .",
    "observation of @xmath15 would require detectors with sub - kev sensitivities .",
    "accordingly , data taking were optimized for with these strategies .",
    "an ultra low - background high purity germanium ( ulb - hpge ) detector was used for period i ( june 2001 till may 2002 ) data taking , while 186  kg of csi(tl ) crystal scintillators were added in for period ii ( starting january 2003 ) .",
    "both detector systems operate in parallel with the same data acquisition system but independent triggers .",
    "the target detectors are housed in a nitrogen environment to prevent background events due to the diffusion of the radioactive radon gas .      as depicted in figure  [ target]a ,",
    "the ulb - hpge is surrounded by nai(tl ) and csi(tl ) crystal scintillators as anti - compton detectors , and the whole set - up is further enclosed by another 3.5  cm of ofhc copper and lead blocks .",
    "after suppression of cosmic - induced background , anti - compton vetos and convoluted events by pulse shape discrimination , the measured spectra for 4712/1250 hours of reactor on / off data in period i@xcite are displayed in figure  [ geresults]a .",
    "background at the range of 1  kev@xmath16kg@xmath16day@xmath16 and a detector threshold of 5  kev are achieved .",
    "these are the levels comparable to underground dark matter experiment .",
    "comparison of the on and off spectra shows no excess and limits of the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath17 at 90(68)% confidence level ( cl ) were set .",
    "the residual plot together with the best - fit regions are depicted in figure  [ geresults]b .    depicted in figure  [ summaryplots]a is the summary of the results in @xmath18 searches versus the achieved threshold in reactor experiments .",
    "the dotted lines denote the @xmath19 ratio at a particular ( t,@xmath18 ) .",
    "the ks(ge ) experiment has a much lower threshold of 12  kev compared to the other measurements .",
    "the large r - values imply that the ks results are robust against the uncertainties in the sm cross - sections .",
    "the neutrino - photon couplings probed by @xmath13-searches in @xmath20-e scatterings are related to the neutrino radiative decays ( @xmath21)@xcite . the indirect bounds on @xmath21 can be inferred and displayed in figure  [ summaryplots]b . it can be seen that @xmath20-e scatterings give much more stringent bounds than the direct approaches .",
    "the ks data with ulb - hpge are the lowest threshold data so far for reactor neutrino experiments , and therefore allow the studies of several new and more speculative topics .",
    "nuclear fission at reactor cores also produce electron neutrino ( @xmath22 ) through the production of unstable isotopes , such as @xmath23cr and @xmath24fe , via neutron capture , the subsequent decays of these isotopes by electron capture would produce mono - energetic @xmath22 .",
    "a realistic neutron transfer simulation has been carried out to estimate the flux .",
    "physics analysis on the @xmath13 and @xmath21 of @xmath22 will be performed , while the potentials for other physics applications will be studied . in additional ,",
    "an _ inclusive _ analysis of the anomalous neutrino interactions with matter will be performed .",
    "the potential merits of crystal scintillators for low - background low - energy experiments were recently discussed@xcite .",
    "the csi(tl ) detector configuration for the ks experiment is displayed in figure  [ target]b .",
    "each crystal module is 2  kg in mass and consists of a hexagonal - shaped cross - section with 2  cm side and a length 40  cm .",
    "the light output are read out at both ends by custom - designed 29  mm diameter photo - multipliers ( pmts ) with low - activity glass .",
    "the sum and difference of the pmt signals gives information on the energy and the longitudinal position of the events , respectively .",
    "a total of 186  kg ( or 93  modules ) have been commissioned for the period ii data taking .",
    "a major physics goal is the measurement of the standard model neutrino - electron scattering cross sections .",
    "the strategy@xcite is to focus on data at high ( @xmath122  mev ) recoil energy .",
    "the large target mass compensates the drop in the cross - sections .",
    "extensive measurements on the crystal prototype modules have been performed@xcite .",
    "the energy and spatial resolutions as functions of energy are depicted in figure  [ csiresults]a and [ csiresults]b , respectively .",
    "the energy is defined by the total light collection @xmath25 .",
    "it can be seen that a @xmath2610% fwhm energy resolution is achieved at 660  kev .",
    "the detection threshold ( where signals are measured at both pmts ) is @xmath1420  kev .",
    "the longitudinal position can be obtained by considering the variation of the ratio @xmath27 along the crystal .",
    "resolutions of @xmath262  cm and @xmath263.5  cm at 660  kev and 200  kev , respectively , have been demonstrated .",
    "in addition , csi(tl ) provides powerful pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) capabilities to differentiate @xmath28/e from @xmath29 events , with an excellent separation of @xmath1299% above 500  kev .",
    "the light output for @xmath29 s in csi(tl ) is quenched less than that in liquid scintillators .",
    "the absence of multiple @xmath29-peaks above 3  mev  @xcite in the prototype measurements suggests that a @xmath30u and @xmath31th concentration ( assuming equilibrium ) of @xmath32  g / g can be achieved .",
    "it has been shown that psd can also be achieved for pulse shapes which are partially saturated@xcite .",
    "the typical @xmath33 versus @xmath34 distributions for single - site events after cosmic vetos are depicted in figure  [ csiresults]c .",
    "there are evidence of contamination of internal radioactivity due to residual @xmath35cs , such that the distributions of the 662-kev events are uniform across the 40  cm crystal length .",
    "events due to @xmath28-background from @xmath36k ( 1460  kev ) and @xmath37tl ( 2612  kev ) , on the other hand , occur more frequently near both edges , indicating that they are from sources external to the crystals .",
    "the background is very low above 2.6  mev , making this a favorable range to provide a measurement of @xmath38 .",
    "various r&d projects with are proceeding in parallel to the ks reactor neutrino experiment .",
    "the highlights are :      it is recognized recently that @xmath39yb and @xmath40gd are good candidate targets in the detection of solar neutrino ( @xmath22 ) by providing a flavor - specific time - delayed tag@xcite .",
    "our work on the gd - loaded scintillating crystal gso@xcite indicated major background issues to be addressed .",
    "we are exploring the possibilities of developing yb - based scintillating crystals , like doping the known crystals @xmath41(ybag ) and @xmath42(ybap ) with scintillators .",
    "the case of `` ultra low - energy '' ulb - hpge detectors , with the potential applications of dark matter searches and neutrino - nuclei coherent scatterings , is being investigated .",
    "as depicted in the measurement with a @xmath24fe x - ray source on a 5  g prototype detector in figure  [ ulege ] , a hardware energy threshold of better than 300  ev has been achieved .",
    "software techniques are studied to further suppress the electronic noise to reduce this threshold .",
    "it is technically feasible to build an array of such detectors to increase the target size to the 1  kg mass range .",
    "experiments based on the mass range of 100  kg of nai(tl ) are producing some of the most sensitive results in dark matter `` wimp '' searches@xcite .",
    "the feasibilities and technical details of adapting csi(tl ) or other good candidate crystal like caf@xmath43(eu ) for wimp searches have been studied . a neutron test beam measurement for csi(tl )",
    "was successfully performed at iae 13  mv tandem accelerator@xcite .",
    "we have collected the lowest threshold data for nuclear recoils in csi(tl ) , enabling us to derive the quenching factors , displayed in figure  [ ciaebeam]a , as well as to study the pulse shape discrimination techniques at the realistically low light output regime@xcite .",
    "the measurements also provide the first confirmation of the optical model predictions on neutron elastic scatterings with a direct measurement on the nuclear recoils of heavy nuclei , as illustrated by the differential cross - section measurements of figure  [ ciaebeam]b . a full scale dark matter experiment with csi(tl )",
    "crystals is being pursued by the kims collaboration in south korea@xcite .",
    "measuring the radio - purity of detector target materials as well as other laboratory components are crucial to the success of low - background experiments .",
    "the typical methods are direct photon counting with high - purity germanium detectors , @xmath29-counting with silicon detectors , conventional mass spectrometry or the neutron activation techniques .",
    "we are exploring the capabilities of radio - purity measurements further with the new accelerator mass spectroscopy ( ams ) techniques@xcite .",
    "this approach may be complementary to existing methods since it is in principle a superior and more versatile method as demonstrated in the @xmath44c system , and it is sensitive to radioactive isotopes that do not emit @xmath28-rays ( like single beta - decays from @xmath45rb and @xmath46i ) or where @xmath28 emissions are suppressed ( for instance , measuring @xmath47k provides a gain of 10@xmath48 in sensitivity relative to detecting @xmath28 s from @xmath49k ) .",
    "a pilot measurement of the @xmath46i/@xmath50i ratio ( @xmath32 ) in csi was successfully performed demonstrating the capabilities of the collaboration .",
    "further beam time is scheduled at the iae ams facilities@xcite to devise measuring schemes for the other other candidate isotopes like @xmath30u , @xmath31th , @xmath45rb , @xmath49k in liquid and crystal scintillators beyond the present capabilities by the other techniques .",
    "the first isotope to study is on @xmath49k , where the goal sensitivity of a @xmath51 should be achieve - able by the ams techniques .",
    "based on the design and operation of the fadcs at the ks experiment , we developed new fadcs for the time projection chamber ( tpc ) constructed as a sub - detector for the leps experiment at the spring8 synchrotron facilities in japan@xcite .",
    "the leps fadcs have 40  mhz sampling rate , 10-bit dynamic range , 32 channels per module and are equipped with field programmable gate array ( fpga ) capabilities for real time data processing .",
    "the tpc has 1000  readout channels and a typical cosmic - ray event is depicted in figure  [ fadctpc ] .",
    "the new system will be commissioned at leps in summer 2003 .",
    "the upgraded fadcs will be further optimized and implemented to the ks reactor neutrino experiment for data taking in 2004 .     +",
    "the strong evidence of neutrino masses and mixings@xcite lead to intense world - wide efforts to pursue the next - generation of neutrino projects .",
    "neutrino physics and astrophysics will remain a central subject in experimental particle physics in the coming decade and beyond .",
    "there are room for ground - breaking technical innovations @xmath52 as well as potentials for surprises in the scientific results .",
    "a collaboration among scientists from taiwan and china has been built up with the goal of establishing a qualified experimental program in neutrino and astro - particle physics .",
    "it is the first generation collaborative efforts in large - scale basic research between scientists from taiwan and china .",
    "the flagship effort is to perform the first - ever particle physics experiment in taiwan at the kuo - sheng reactor plant .",

    "further measurements are pursued at the kuo - sheng laboratory , including the standard model neutrino - electron scattering cross - section as well as neutrino coherent scattering with the nuclei .",
    "a wide spectrum of r&d projects are being pursued in parallel .",
    "the importance of the implications and outcomes of the experiment and experience will lie besides , if not beyond , neutrino physics .",
    "the authors are grateful to the scientific members , technical staff and industrial partners of texono collaboration , as well as the concerned colleagues in our communities for the many contributions which `` make it happen '' in such a short period of time .",

    "the materials discussed in this article were scheduled for presentations at the ndm03 symposium . however , the sars problems in our regions prevented the authors from attending the meeting .",
