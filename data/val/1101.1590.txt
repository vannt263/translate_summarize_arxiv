    "the imaging discovery of the three @xcite , and now four @xcite planets around hr  8799 is a significant achievement in the search for and study of planets orbiting other stars .",
    "for the first time , the thermal emission of planets in orbit around another star has been unambiguously detected .",
    "the dynamical evolution of a planetary system is complex . from the basic planet formation assumption that planets form by the core accretion or disk instability scenario in a disk along the star s equatorial plane , systems can suffer drastic changes ; planet - planet perturbations , interactions with a disk or stellar encounters can change a planet s orbital inclination , its semi - major axis , its orbital eccentricity or even eject it @xcite . in the case of hr  8799",
    ", it is not impossible that a close encounter occurred prior to planet formation , since its relatively high galactic velocity compared to the columba association and its far distance away from the other association members @xcite are suggesting that it may have been kicked out and is probably moving quickly away from its birth place .",
    "such an encounter could have tilted a disk relative to the star s equatorial plane and induce perturbations that may have led to planet formation where planets would have a non - negligible orbital inclination relative to the star .",
    "radial velocity searches have confirmed such chaotic behaviors by detecting systems where planets are orbiting well away from the star s equatorial plane ( @xcite and references therein ) , although for close - in extrasolar planets this misalignment could also be caused by the kozai mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for the wide hr8799 planets the kozai mechanism is not operational ( even if the system had a stellar companion in the past ) ; finding a misalignment between the star and the planet s orbital plane would be a sign of a significant dynamical interaction in the system past .",
    "@xcite have suggested that the hr  8799 planets are in a similar orbital plane with a low inclination and have mostly circular orbits .",
    "this is because the detected orbital motions are close to their expected face - on circular orbit values , the orbital motion is mainly in azimuth and the star is known to be a slow rotator ( thus it would be viewed mainly pole - on ) .",
    "dynamical analyses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have confirmed that the planets are mostly in the same plane with small eccentricities , although such fits are still very uncertain due to the limited amount of orbital coverage available .",
    "in addition , the planets also all orbit in the same counter - clockwise orientation , further supporting the idea that they formed in a disk , similar to the solar system planets . assuming a circular orbit for b , @xcite found @xmath513@xmath623@xmath6 ;",
    "while attempting a coherent analysis of various portions of observational data on known components of the system , @xcite concluded that @xmath7 should range between 20@xmath6 and 30@xmath6 . also , spitzer observations of hr  8799 s complex debris disk suggest that any inclination angle larger than @xmath825@xmath6 should be excluded @xcite .",
    "using a statistical distribution of star s rotation speed @xcite , hr  8799 with its 37.5@xmath92 kms@xmath1 vsin@xmath7 @xcite would be consistent with an inclination of @xmath10 if it is an a5 star or @xmath11 if it is an f0 star ( hr  8799 spectral classification is uncertain mainly due to its low metallicity that is affecting it s broad band colors ) .",
    "such a determination is of course statistical and a direct star s inclination determination is required for a meaningful comparison with the estimated planet orbital plane inclination .",
    "hr  8799 is an intrinsic photometric and spectroscopic variable @xcite .",
    "it has also been confirmed as a @xmath0doradus ( dor ) variable @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0dor stars are late a to early f stars whose pulsations are driven by a flux - blocking mechanism at the base of their convective envelope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0dor nature of hr  8799 offers a unique opportunity to estimate its inclination via an asteroseismic analysis of the observed @xmath12-modes . in a previous asteroseismic analysis using photometric frequencies",
    "@xcite has shown that an age determination for the system , which allows to discriminate between planets and brown dwarfs , is a difficult task with the current information and discussed the importance of an inclination determination since the equatorial rotational velocity can be used in constraining the age of the system . in this letter , we present a spectroscopic asteroseismic analysis and also obtain limits for hr  8799 s stellar inclination .",
    "the data have been acquired from an extensive multi - site ground - based high - resolution spectroscopy campaign .",
    "section  2 describes that data used in this letter .",
    "section  3 discusses the pulsation mode identification and the determination of the stellar inclination and section  4 describes the conclusions .",
    "in this letter we examine data collected from observatoire de haute provence ( ohp ) using the sophie spectrograph .",
    "we have 650 sophie observations taken from 28/09 - 12/10/2009 .",
    "they cover a wavelength range between 38756940  with a spectral resolution of r@xmath875000 .",
    "these data are the largest single - site subset of more than 2000 observations taken during an intensive spectroscopic multi - site campaign devoted to this star .",
    "only the ohp spectra will be examined in this publication as study of the complete combined data set of observations will be left until the detailed publication .",
    "the data were treated using the local reduction packages written specifically for the sophie spectrograph data .",
    "this produced reduced , merged and automatically continuum normalized 1-d spectra which were further manually normalized using a synthetic spectrum for guidance .    instead of using single spectral lines",
    ", we examined the cross - correlation profile ( ccp ) .",
    "this profile is obtained using the normalised 1-d spectra cross - correlated with a line mask .",
    "the line mask was produced with the synspec software @xcite using a t@xmath13=7500 k , @xmath14 and z=-1.0 .",
    "all the telluric and h / he affected areas were removed from the spectral line for which we estimated the equivalent widths .",
    "these equivalent widths were used for the weightings given to the delta - functions in the cross - correlation .",
    "an analysis of the variation of several isolated spectral lines gave similar results to those outlined for the ccps below .",
    "since the signal - to - noise ratio of the individual spectral lines is much lower than that of the ccps only the ccps are discussed here .",
    "the resulting line variation was examined using the first moment of the line profile which is similar to the radial velocity of the line ( shown in figure 1 : left ) .",
    "a fourier analysis of the first moment gives two strong frequencies 1.9875d@xmath1 and 1.7475d@xmath1 ( shown in figure 1 : right ) .",
    "these frequencies by themselves produce a good fit to the observed radial velocity variations .",
    "they closely correspond with those found in photometry by both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is possible to identify further frequencies present in the data but upon examination it is observed that extraction of any combination of the other frequencies present does not alter the results for the 1.98d@xmath1 frequency .",
    "the focus for this letter is on the inclination restrictions possible from the 1.98d@xmath1 frequency , hence we will continue without examining any further frequency information , and leave that for the detailed publication based on the whole dataset of the campaign .     and",
    "1.7475d@xmath1 fit for the first half of the ohp data ( left ) . frequency analysis of the radial velocity of the ohp data ( right ) with lines marking the frequencies determined . ]    to determine the degree @xmath2 and azimuthal order @xmath15 of the pulsation mode using the famias software @xcite we extract the fourier parameters , i.e. the zero point , the amplitude and the phase distributions across the ccps , for the two frequencies .",
    "the fourier parameters of 1.9875d@xmath1 are shown as a solid line in the panels of figure 2 .",
    "the fourier parameters of 1.7475d@xmath1 were not sufficiently well matched by the famias software to consider this pulsation mode identified or constrained .",
    "this is probably a result of other pulsation frequencies present in the data that have not been detected or removed , and that have sufficient amplitude to affect the parameters of the 1.7475d@xmath1 mode .",
    "the famias software uses a first order coriolis force approximation , limiting the pulsation models that can be used to fit the fourier parameters to those respecting @xmath16 1 , where @xmath17 is the so - called `` spin - parameter '' .",
    "this parameter is defined as @xmath17 = 2 f@xmath18/f@xmath19 , where f@xmath18 is the rotation frequency and f@xmath19 is the pulsation frequency in the corotating frame .",
    "f@xmath19 is connected to the observed pulsation frequency f@xmath20 through : f@xmath19 = f@xmath20 - @xmath15f@xmath18 and , hence , changes for different values of @xmath15 of the model being fitted . as for f@xmath18 ,",
    "its changes depend on the inclination used by the model . on the other hand",
    ", one could wonder how significant is the effect of stellar rotation when @xmath21 1 and if the fit of the fourier parameters could still be trusted passed this limit .",
    "@xcite examined the effects of the increasing coriolis force on high order ( @xmath22 ) low degree ( @xmath2 ) gravity - modes ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) and found that prograde modes ( @xmath230 , this paper ; @xmath240 in @xcite ) suffer reduced changes from increasing coriolis force . using this study we can estimate more appropriate @xmath17 limitations for the famias models of the 1.9875d@xmath1 frequency . for the values of @xmath15=-3:3 ,",
    "limits of @xmath258 for @xmath15=3 , @xmath255 for @xmath15=2 , @xmath252 for @xmath15=1 and @xmath251 for @xmath260 are reasonable . using these @xmath17 limitations and the estimated stellar parameters r@xmath27=1.5r@xmath28 @xcite , vsin@xmath7=39.5 kms@xmath1 ( i.e. a value within the uncertainties given by this study and by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we can place restrictions on the inclination for which the famias models are valid for each value of @xmath15 , they are @xmath7= 60@xmath4 , 37@xmath4 , 32@xmath4 , 32@xmath4 , 15@xmath4 , 0@xmath4 and 0@xmath4 for @xmath15= 3 , 2 , 1 , 0 , -1 , -2 and -3 , respectively .",
    "these model limits imply that we can not test all the inclinations between 0@xmath6 and 90@xmath6 .",
    "however , one has to consider that an inclination lower than 5@xmath4 is physically impossible , since it would imply an equatorial rotation velocity higher than the break - up velocity when using an estimated mass of m@xmath27=1.5m@xmath28 @xcite .",
    "moreover , models with @xmath15=1 , 2 and 3 are limited to @xmath2916@xmath4 , 33@xmath4 and 54@xmath4 respectively to be physically possible ( f@xmath30 0 ) .",
    "a summary of the limitations on the inclination of the pulsational axis is given in table 1 . from this table",
    "it can be seen which are the physically possible values of @xmath15 and inclination that we are unable to test due to the famias model restrictions .",
    "however , these `` holes '' can be mitigated by the fact that at lower inclinations than those imposed by the model limits , the @xmath17 value , and hence the coriolis force , becomes large enough that the pulsations surface deformations begin to be limited to an equatorial waveguide @xcite . in these cases",
    "just the regions about the equator are varying , but we would be viewing the star from low inclinations .",
    "this means that only a small area of the visible surface would be experiencing pulsation and the radial velocity amplitude would be expected to be low when compared with observed radial velocity amplitudes in other @xmath0dor stars . to give an example of this ,",
    "if @xmath7=20@xmath4 and the mode was @xmath15=0 then approximately one quarter of the full surface variability is visible since more than half the pulsation amplitude is constrained to within 35@xmath4 of the equator .",
    "in contrast , the 1.98d@xmath1 frequency in question has an amplitude of 1.09 kms@xmath1 which is comparable to the radial velocity amplitudes of the strongest mode in other @xmath0dor stars e.g. 1.3 kms@xmath1 in @xmath0doradus @xcite , 0.35 kms@xmath1 in hd49434 @xcite , 1.45 kms@xmath1 in hd189631 and 0.49 kms@xmath1 in hd40745 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that we are dealing with a strong coriolis force and hence a high @xmath17 value for a given @xmath15 value .",
    "because of this the inclination `` holes '' mentioned previously , which are associated with high @xmath17 values , can be considered as unlikely solutions .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      is the solid line .",
    "the best fit @xmath2=1 @xmath15=1 mode is the dashed - dotted line with a @xmath31 of 30.0 .",
    "the next best fitting mode of those tested is the @xmath2=2 @xmath15=-2 mode shown as a dotted line with @xmath31=43.9 . ]",
    "= 1 @xmath15=1 mode .",
    "the inset figure is a zoom in on the region of low @xmath31 . for inclinations i@xmath3240@xmath6 the differences in @xmath31",
    "is small . ]",
    "figure 3 shows the inclination dependence of the genetic algorithm search for the best fitting @xmath2=1 @xmath15=1 mode .",
    "based on table 1 we can confidently use the famias results for @xmath3332@xmath4 .",
    "the best fit inclination has @xmath7=65@xmath4 . for @xmath7= 35@xmath4 , 40@xmath4 and 90@xmath4 ,",
    "we find @xmath31= 37.2 , 32.9 and 31.07 , respectively .",
    "it is obvious from figure 3 that the @xmath31 does not change much in the range @xmath7= 40@xmath4 to 90@xmath4 but it rises quickly at lower inclinations . from this",
    "we obtain our result @xmath340@xmath4 .",
    "the famias software assumes that pulsation axis is aligned with the rotational axis , but this is not necessarily the case in all stars .",
    "however , such misalignment is unlikely in the case of hr  8799 because , in that case , some modulation of the pulsation properties by the rotational period would have been observed .",
    "in addition , it would have led to more complex amplitude and phase across the profile , and the fits that we have achieved would not have been as good .",
    "it is worth noting that no planetary reflex velocity is identified .",
    "this was expected since the amplitudes of the quite distant and low orbital inclination exo - planets would be only fractions of a meter per second which would be masked by the much larger ( kms@xmath1 ) pulsational velocities and is also beyond the precision attainable by our observations .",
    "we conclude that the stellar rotational inclination axis has a value i@xmath3240@xmath6 based on identification of the 1.98d@xmath1 frequency as an @xmath2=1 @xmath15=1 mode .",
    "this is the strongest pulsation in both photometry @xcite and spectroscopic radial velocities . through dynamical analyses",
    "it is suspected that the planets are mostly in the same plane with small eccentricities and that the planets orbit inclination axis is @xmath820@xmath3410@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the current data suggests a misalignment of @xmath3520@xmath6 between the stellar rotational inclination and planetary orbit axes , though more detailed pulsational analyses and better orbital fits are needed before this can be confirmed .",
