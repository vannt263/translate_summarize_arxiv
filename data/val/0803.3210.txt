    "magnetic fields , with amplitudes of around 1@xmath6gauss have been observed in galaxies and clusters@xcite . indeed it has been argued that these fields may play a role in galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "it is believed that these fields may have arisen from a common mechanism : an amplification of a weak primordial field through adiabatic collapse or some form of cosmic dynamo .",
    "there is a suite of proposals for the origin of the primordial field , i.e. the seed field , from phase transitions , to parity violating processes and inflation . in general the seed fields generated by these mechanisms",
    "will be stochastic and spatially varying .",
    "there is , however , the possibility that the primordial magnetic field is homogeneous , embedded in the large scale fabric of the universe@xcite .",
    "all of these possibilities should lead to distinct observational signatures . in this paper",
    "we will focus on one such signature , the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the polarization of the cmb is generated by thomson scattering of the quadrupole temperature anisotropy at the last scattering surface .",
    "since the dipole anisotropy does not generate any polarization , the amplitude of the polarization signal will be significantly lower than for the temperature anisotropies , which get most of the power from the scattering of the dipole anisotropy .",
    "this low amplitude leads to experimental challenges .",
    "however , the different polarization power spectra will provide important and complimentary information to what we can learn from studying the temperature fluctuations alone , and up and coming experiments , such as clover @xcite , ebex @xcite , quiet @xcite , spider @xcite and planck @xcite , will attempt to do measure the cmb polarization signal with unprecedented precision .",
    "primordial magnetic fields leads to faraday rotation of cmb polarization .",
    "this alters the overall pattern of the cmb polarization by mixing @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes .",
    "the effect can play a role on small scales ( in the case of stochastic magnetic fields)@xcite and large scales ( in the case of homogeneous magnetic fields ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we explore the latter and forecast how well we can use future cmb polarization experiments to constrain the amplitude of the magnetic field .",
    "the polarization of the cmb can be described in terms of the stokes parameters , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "these parameters quantify the intensity of the incoming radiation in mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 parameters are not rotationally invariant and depend on the specific choice of coordinate system .",
    "it is therefore convenient to transform to rotationally invariant @xmath7 ( curl free ) and @xmath8 ( divergence free ) modes before comparing observations to theory .",
    "these are defined by ( q iu ) ( n ) = - _ lm ( e_lm ib_lm ) _",
    "2y_lm(n ) , where @xmath11 denotes the spin - weighted spherical harmonics .",
    "the thomson scattering process will only generate @xmath7 modes from scalar perturbations of the metric and stress energy tensor . in the standard cosmological picture today",
    "the @xmath8 modes are only generated by relic gravitational waves from inflation or from gravitational lensing of @xmath7 modes .",
    "these two processes will induce a frequency independent @xmath8 mode signal for low @xmath12s and high @xmath12s respectively .",
    "@xmath8 modes created by gravitational waves and lensing will lead to a non - zero @xmath3 autocorrelation signal .",
    "non - zero correlations between the @xmath8 mode and the @xmath7 or @xmath13 ( temperature ) modes can only occur under processes that break parity invariance .",
    "thus , any detection of a non - zero @xmath1 or @xmath2 signal would be a sign of physics beyond the cosmological standard paradigm .",
    "a large - scale homogeneous magnetic field is an example of a parity violating field , and the faraday rotation of cmb polarization induced by such a field will indeed result in non - zero @xmath2 and @xmath1 correlations . in an otherwise standard cosmological scenario",
    "such a magnetic field will tend to rotate @xmath7 modes generated by thomson scattering into @xmath8 modes .",
    "thus one would expect non - zero @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 signals with power spectra similar to the corresponding @xmath7 mode spectra , but with a different amplitude . since faraday rotation is frequency dependent",
    ", one would expect the magnitude of this effect to depend on the frequency in which the cmb polarization is observed .",
    "the effects of such a large - scale magnetic field on the cmb power spectra were studied @xcite and @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors looked at the @xmath1 power spectrum and found that one could expect to put upper limits on a primordial magnetic field of the order @xmath14gauss by the planck experiment , where @xmath0 denotes the strength of the magnetic field today . in @xcite the authors derived equations for all the @xmath8 power spectra using the total angular momentum method @xcite .",
    "our method for calculating the different cmb power spectra is based on ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refer to this paper for further details on the notation and derivations .    the effect of the faraday rotation is conveniently described by the time independent parameter @xmath15 , given by f = 0.7 ( ) ( ) ^2 , where @xmath16 denotes the strength of the magnetic field and @xmath17 is the frequency of the radiation . in @xcite",
    "the authors found that , if there are no @xmath8 modes in the absence of a magnetic field , the effect on the cmb @xmath7 and @xmath8 modes by including a non - zero @xmath15 can be expressed by e_lm ib_lm & = & _ l,l  r(lm , l,lm ) ^(l)_lm . where @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of clebsch - gordan coefficients : r(lm , l,lm ) & = & i^l + & & l,l;m - m,m ",

    "we refer to @xcite .    with this definition of @xmath19 the @xmath26 power spectrum",
    "is now given by c_l^te = c_l^t e^(0 ) .",
    "resulting @xmath26 power spectra for different values of @xmath15 are shown in figure [ fig : cls ] .    for the other power spectra we will only study the limit @xmath27 , which is likely to be a good approximation . in this limit we can neglect contributions from @xmath28 in ( [ eq : etilde ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1 correlation can then be approximated by c_l^tb = c_l^te^(1 ) _ m =- l^l ^1/2 [ eq : tb ] here it should be stressed that the @xmath1 correlations are non - diagonal . in the limit of @xmath27",
    "the contributions come from the @xmath29 correlations .",
    "the @xmath30 given in ( [ eq : tb ] ) then represents a mean of the two off - diagonal contributions .",
    "similarly , the @xmath2 correlation can be expressed as c_l^eb = c_l^e^(0 ) e^(1 ) _ m =- l^l ^1/2 [ eq : te ] also here the correlation is off - diagonal and eq .",

    "the autocorrelation polarization power spectra are given by c_l^ee & = & c_l^e^(0 ) e^(0 ) + c_l^bb & = & 13 .",
    "the resulting power spectra have been calculated with a modified version of camb @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : cls ] the power spectra are plotted for different values of @xmath15 with the other cosmological parameters fixed to concordance @xmath32cdm values . from the figure it is obvious that both the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 power spectra are promising targets for constraining @xmath0 , especially since all these power spectra are expected to be zero in the case of @xmath33 .     as a function of multipole @xmath12 .",

    "the amplitude of the @xmath38 power spectrum will however scale like @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to forecast the sensitivity of future cmb polarization experiments to the effect of a homogeneous magnetic field as described in section [ sec : cls ] .",
    "we will do this using a fisher matrix approach . in our analysis",
    "we will assume all cosmological parameters except for @xmath15 to be known .",
    "this can be justified since our results are driven by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 correlations , which are zero when @xmath25 .",
    "we will also make use of the @xmath3 correlation , but we note that the @xmath3 power spectrum from a homogeneous magnetic field differs significantly from the @xmath3 correlations from gravitational waves and lensing of @xmath7 modes",

    "[ eq : sigmas ] here @xmath46 denotes the fraction of the sky covered by the experiment .",

    "this factor is the part of the sky actually used in the analysis after the galaxy cut has been made.the fraction of the sky that is scanned by the experiment is denoted @xmath47 .",
    "it appears multiplying @xmath48 because a smaller scanned sky fraction means longer integration time per pixel .",
    "partial - sky experiments will of course aim to avoid the troublesome galaxy plane in their scanning strategy , making @xmath49 for such experiments .    a convenient notation to describe the noise in a pixel independent way is @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "here @xmath51 is the angular pixel size , @xmath52 is the time used observing each pixel and @xmath53 is the total number of pixels .",
    "the detector sensitivity is denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55k is the average sky temperature .",
    "we have @xmath56 for @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath58 we have w_xx^-1 = 2.14 10 ^ -15 t_^-1 ( ) ^2 [ eq : winv ] , where @xmath59 is the observing time in years . from now on",
    "we denote @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "the @xmath67s appearing in ( [ eq : sigmas ] ) are given in dimensionless @xmath68 units . when estimating parameter errors from the @xmath3 power spectrum , we use @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaf ] ) , since the @xmath3 power spectrum scales as @xmath39 .      in the procedure described above ,",
    "we have neglected all effects from foregrounds .",
    "how much the foregrounds will affect the obtained limits on the magnetic field strength will depend on the specific experiments used , our understanding of the statistical properties of the different foregrounds , and whether a significant proportion of the foregrounds has been successfully subtracted from the cmb maps before the parameter analysis is performed . to do a proper analysis of all the involved foreground effects",
    "is outside the scope of this work .",
    "however , we will use a simple foreground model to estimate the possible effects of foregrounds on our results .    at the frequencies relevant here ( @xmath71ghz ) , the synchrotron emission from our galaxy is the dominant source of polarized foregrounds @xcite . for frequencies of order 100ghz",
    "the polarized emission from vibrating dust will also contribute . in the following analysis",
    "we will only include these two foreground components .",
    "we will then simply add the foreground signal to the cmb signal in eq .",

    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us first concentrate on the results obtained without the foreground model .",
    "we can identify which power spectrum gives the best results depends on the experiment under consideration . that @xmath1 is less important for quiet than for e.g. planck is easily understood by the fact that quiet has much better @xmath79 relative to @xmath80 than the bolometer based experiments .",
    "but we have also seen that the results from the @xmath2 and @xmath3 power spectra depend more strongly on @xmath79 and @xmath80 than does the @xmath1 power spectrum .",
    "this explains e.g. why we for planck find the best limits from using @xmath1 , while the best limits come from @xmath2 for clover .",
    "the most impressive results come from the quiet experiment s phase 2 telescopes . here",
    "the eb power spectrum can constrain @xmath0 by @xmath81 and @xmath82 from the 2 m and 7 m telescopes , respectively .",
    "this is approximately a factor 50 better than what we find for planck @xmath1 and spider , a factor 20 better than ebex and about a factor 5 better than clover and quijote .    adding the foreground model , this picture changes significantly .",
    "the results from quiet p2 now weakens by more than an order of magnitude , while the changes for the other experiments are typically by @xmath83 .",
    "the reason why quiet is much more sensitive to this foreground is caused by several factors .",
    "firstly , the quiet experiment covers a small fraction of the sky , and we have seen that while this can be beneficial in a foreground - free scenario , the opposite is the case when the foreground is present . also , quiet operates at a relative low frequency compared to for example clover and ebex , which makes the synchrotron foreground much stronger , as its amplitude has a @xmath84 dependence .",
    "we have also seen that the effect of having good experimental sensitivity is less important in the presence of foregrounds .",
    "the result is that when including the foreground model , we find the best results from clover @xmath2 , giving @xmath85gauss , which is a factor 3 better than what we find for quiet , a factor 6 better than ebex and an order of magnitude better than planck .    which of the results with or without the foreground are more close to the real performance of the experiments depends on how well the foreground can be subtracted from the maps .",
    "this will be of special importance for quiet and less important for the other experiments considered here .",
    "also , we have assumed perfect knowledge of the statistical properties of the foreground model .",
    "when analyzing a real experiment , these uncertainties must be taken into account and this may alter the results , especially for a `` foreground sensitive '' experiment like quiet .",
    "we also note that the results in table [ tab : results ] are quoted for each individual power spectrum .",
    "simply combining the results from the different power spectra ( and experiments ) will of course improve the limits slightly .",
    "in this work we have calculated cmb power spectra for a universe with a primordial , homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "we introduced a simple foreground model , and applied a fisher matrix approach to explore how the experimental sensitivity to such a magnetic field depended on different experimental parameters .",
    "we then attempted to forecast our ability to constrain @xmath86 for various future cmb polarization experiments .",
    "in our foreground model we have assumed perfect knowledge of the statistical behavior of the foregrounds , but that none of it has been removed from the cmb maps prior to the parameter analysis .",
    "we argue that this can be regarded as a conservative approach . including this foreground model we find that among the experiments considered here , clover has the best prospects of constraining @xmath0 , and we find @xmath87gauss in this case . when assuming that all foregrounds are perfectly subtracted from the maps , we find quiet to be the most promising experiment , giving @xmath88gauss .",
    "this is two orders of magnitude better than the present upper limits on @xmath0 from using the homogeneous anisotropy of cmb @xcite . for the quiet experiment ,",
    "the results rely heavily on the ability to successfully subtract the foregrounds , while the other experiments under consideration are less dependent on this .    to conclude",
    ", our study shows that we will be able to significantly improve our knowledge of possible primordial homogenous magnetic fields in the coming years .",
    "a positive detection will impact both the construction of inflationary models and our understanding of the origins of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters .",
