    "our determination of the angular diameter @xmath0 is more than four times more precise than that from interferometry by @xcite .",
    "these authors warned about their angular size for hd 209458 being at the resolution limit of chara / pavo and that they used calibrators up to @xmath4930% smaller than this object .",
    "nevertheless , their value is consistent with ours .    while interferometry can be only applied to bright nearby stars , absolute flux spectrophotometry compared with stellar atmosphere models yields very precise angular diameters for a wide range of luminosities .",
    "@xcite have shown that while for a bright a star such as vega the achieved uncertainty of 0.4% in @xmath0 is similar to that from interferometry , for fainter a stars ( v@xmath493 - 6 mag ) the precisions from the absolute flux comparison method are several times better than the respective interferometric precisions .    for the faintest a stars in the sample of @xcite ( 7.1 @xmath61 7.5 mag",

    "we arrived at @xmath64 = 0.75% and @xmath66 = 4% .",
    "therefore , the precision in all these stellar radii is limited by the uncertainty in the _ hipparcos _ parallax .",
    "these radii could be recalculated with much higher precision from the forthcoming _ gaia _ parallaxes ( @xmath67 0.05% ) , yielding stellar radius uncertainties under 1% .    for fast - rotating a - type stars interferometry offers the advantage of directly gauging the oblateness and gravity darkening , but this is generally only possible for nearby bright stars .",
    "just recently , some advances have been performed to correct for the effect of rotational distortion in fainter a stars and to properly quantify their sizes @xcite .",
    "stellar evolution models such as those used in @xcite and the ones employed to this research can reproduce well the stellar properties of hd 209458 and other sun - like stars .",
    "but they may present difficulties to predict the properties of more massive stars and low mass stars .",
    "for example , from the comparison of interferometric angular diameters with stellar evolutionary models for a sample of k - and m - dwarfs @xcite found that such models overestimate the effective temperatures of stars with @xmath6 < 5000k by @xmath493% and underestimate their radii for @xmath680.7 r@xmath3 by @xmath495% .",
    "asteroseismology is an alternative technique to ascertain fundamental properties of pulsating stars .",
    "recently , it has been successfully applied to derive linear stellar radii and masses with typical uncertainties of @xmath493% and @xmath497% , respectively , for a sample of 66 planet - candidate host stars observed with kepler ( 7.8 @xmath69 13.8 mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "space asteroseismology is usually combined with ground - based high - resolution spectroscopy values of @xmath6 and [ fe / h ] to precisely obtain the stellar parameters of sun - like and red giants . the stellar radius and surface gravity",
    "can be tightly constrained by a precise value of the effective temperature . while the metallicity permits to constrain the stellar mass and age ( see review of * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "mean density , surface gravity and radius determined from this technique are shown to be largely model independent .",
    "@xcite found , for more than half of their sample , discrepancies greater than 50% between the densities derived from asteroseismology and those from transit models assuming circular orbits ( mostly underestimated ) .",
    "they concluded this was due to systematics in the modeled impact parameters or the presence of candidates in eccentric orbits .",
    "it will be eventually possible to compare , for an statistically significant sample of stars , the values of their radii obtained from all the above - mentioned techniques with uncertainties better than 1% .",
    "this will allow us to further search for and reduce systematic errors .",
    "it is well - known that stellar activity ( e.g. , spots ) may affect the determination of the planetary parameters from light curves , such as the planet - to - star radius ratio .",
    "planetary radii values are generally prone to such systematics .",
    "however , apart from the presence of transits , no variability has been reported for hd 209458 .",
    "we stress the good consistency between the values of the planetary radius obtained from our stellar radius and the hst / stis light curve in the optical , and the _ spitzer_/irac light curve in the infrared .",
    "we conclude that the determination of the radius of the planet is not affected by this issue .    as previously mentioned",
    "the parallax uncertainty is the main contributor to that in the stellar radius . if using the modeled value @xmath9=21.12@xmath10.72 mas by @xcite the stellar radius decreases to @xmath2=1.15@xmath10.04  r@xmath3 . from this value and our determination of @xmath54 using parsec ( see  [ isochrones ] ) , we found @xmath53=1.05@xmath10.12  g  cm@xmath43 and @xmath47= 4.37@xmath10.03  ( @xmath34 in cm  s@xmath14 ) , instead of the values obtained from the first approach presented in ",

    "[ star : mgd ] , the new value of @xmath2 has a small impact on @xmath47 ( 4.36 instead of 4.38 ; with @xmath34 in cm  s@xmath14 ) , but it reduces @xmath54 from 1.26 to 1.10 m@xmath3 . note the latter is closer to the mass derived from parsec models in  [ isochrones ] .",
    "concerning @xmath4 , it drops by @xmath495% to 1.35@xmath10.05 @xmath5 when using the parallax of @xcite .",

    "finally , @xmath57 = 0.67@xmath10.05 @xmath58 when using the parallax of @xcite .",
    "this value is similar to the dynamical mass of 0.64@xmath10.09 @xmath58 obtained by @xcite .",
    "our results confirm that the radius of hd 209458b is too large for the composition and age of its host star , challenging current theory models of internal structure . _",
    "gaia _ will provide a reliable parallax measurement , which can be used to improve on the stellar and planetary parameters , in particular the stellar radius , with an expected precision better than 1%",
    ". this will be useful to check the goodness of the stellar evolutionary models through the comparison with direct and nearly model - independent values .",
    "absolute flux spectrophotometry can efficiently provide nearly model independent stellar angular diameters and effective temperatures for a broad range of spectral types ( a - type and sun - like stars ) .",
    "the values of the angular diameters derived from flux ratios are several times more precise than those from interferometry .",
    "combining angular diameters with accurate parallaxes it is possible to obtain very accurate radii . for transiting systems",
    ", the high level of accuracy in the stellar radius can be translated to the planetary radius @xmath4 from the transit depth determination , and then to the parameters that are related to @xmath4 .",

    "<S> the stellar radius @xmath2=1.20@xmath10.05  r@xmath3 is ascertained by combining the angular diameter with the _ hipparcos _ trigonometric parallax , which is the main contributor to its uncertainty , and therefore the radius accuracy should be significantly improved with _ gaia _ </S>",

    "<S> the radius of the exoplanet @xmath4=1.41@xmath10.06  @xmath5 is derived from the corresponding transit depth in the light curve and our stellar radius . from the model </S>",
    "<S> fitting , we accurately determine the effective temperature , @xmath6=6071@xmath120k , which is in perfect agreement with the value of 6070@xmath124k calculated from the angular diameter and the integrated spectral energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we also find precise values from recent padova isochrones , such as @xmath2=1.20@xmath10.06  r@xmath3 and @xmath6=6099@xmath141k . </S>",
