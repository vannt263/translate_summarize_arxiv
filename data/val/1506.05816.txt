    "discovery of substellar companions at hundreds of au from their host stars in direct imaging surveys has posed challenges to classical formation mechanisms like core accretion @xcite and disk instability @xcite .",
    "the ultra - wide separations make the core - growing timescale exceedingly long , and observers have not yet discovered such long - lived protoplanetary disks .",
    "some alternatives have been proposed , including gravitational scattering to the current location @xcite and in situ star - like formation .",
    "detecting and characterizing circumsubstellar disks can place constraints on formation mechanisms .",
    "many substellar ( close to planetary mass ) companions have been suggested to host their own disks ( separate from the primary s disk ) based on o / ir emission lines or excess .",
    "the 1.28 @xmath6 m pa @xmath7 emission line was seen on gq lup b @xcite , ct cha b @xcite , gsc 0621400210 b @xcite , and fw tau c @xcite .",
    "_ hubble space telescope _",
    "observations by @xcite also showed that gsc 0621400210 b , gq lup b , and dh tau b exhibit an optical excess at @xmath50.30.7  @xmath6 m , implying a mass accretion rate of @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "@xcite also found that 1rxs 1609 b , gq lup b , gsc 0621400210 b , dh tau b , and roxs 12 b have redder @xmath10 colors than young field dwarfs .",
    "an unresolved 24 @xmath6 m excess was also detected on gsc 0621400210 b and 1rxs 1609 b @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite presented an alma cycle 1 1.3 mm detection of dust continuum emission associated with fw tau c and derived a dust mass of 12 @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite further detected co ( 21 ) and showed that gas is also present in this disk .",
    "although fw tau c could be in the brown dwarf regime ( @xmath12  @xmath13 ; @xcite ) , these observations may represent the first direct detection of a disk around a planetary mass object .",
    "recently , using the 6.5 m magellan adaptive optics system ( magao ; @xcite ; @xcite ) we have also detected an @xmath14 ( 0.63 @xmath6 m ) excess possibly due to h@xmath15 and a dust extinction of @xmath16 34 mag for ct cha b @xcite .",
    "all of these observations suggest that circumsubstellar disks could be common around these wide young planetary mass objects .",
    "the existence of disks also favors star - like fragmentation , but argues against a scattering origin .",
    "this is because disks may be perturbed , if not destroyed , by each encounter with another massive body ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we present magao @xmath0 and @xmath1 imaging of 1rxs 1609 b , a substellar companion discovered at 320 au ( projected separation ) from 1rxs j160929.1210524 in the upper scorpius association by @xcite .",
    "the companion is widely reported as the first directly imaged exoplanet orbiting a sun - like star .",
    "its mass , temperature , and spectral type were determined to be 0.0080.011  @xmath4 , @xmath51800  k , and @xmath5l4 ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite revised the age for upper sco to be @xmath17  myr , and , based on that , they derived a higher mass @xmath18  @xmath13 . in this paper , we show that 1rxs 1609 b may have some dust extinction , a higher temperature , and an earlier spectral type .",
    "therefore , it is more likely a low - mass brown dwarf slightly obscured by a dusty circumsecondary disk .",
    "we used magao , a new ao system on the 6.5 m clay telescope , to image 1rxs 1609 a and b at @xmath19 m ; @xmath20 m ) and @xmath21 m ; @xmath22 m ) on 2013 april 6 ( ut ) during the second commissioning run . seeing varied between 06 and 08 .",
    "we used the primary ( @xmath23 mag ) as the guide star , and locked the ao system at 100 karhunen ",
    "love modes and 400 hz .",
    "this is a very faint target given that 50% of the light goes to the visao science camera and 50% to the pyramid wavefront sensor .",
    "that is why only 100 of 378 possible modes were corrected at 400 hz compared to the usual 1000 hz loop speed .",
    "the resulting fwhms were 67 and 72 mas for @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath0 , we obtained 20 s @xmath24 193 ( 3860 s ) and 2.27 s @xmath24 28 ( 63.6 s ) for saturated and unsaturated data , respectively . for @xmath1",
    ", we obtained 20 s @xmath24 126 ( 2520 s ) unsaturated frames .",
    "we only detected 1rxs 1609 b at @xmath0 but not @xmath1 , possibly due to a lower quantum efficiency which leads to a lower total throughput ( 0.013 versus 0.077 ) . to calibrate our photometry",
    ", we retrieved k7v , m0v , and m1v spectral templates from the pickles atlas @xcite , reddened them by @xmath25  mag ( extinction of a ; @xcite ) , and integrated the denis @xcite _ i _ and our @xmath0 and @xmath1 filter curves over these templates as well as the vega spectrum to derive @xmath26 and @xmath27 colors .",
    "then we applied these colors to the existing denis @xmath28 measurement on the primary to obtain @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry .",
    "we adopted 0.06 and 0.10 mag as the uncertainties for @xmath0 and @xmath1 based on comparison to f7v and m1v templates .",
    "we also observed the optical standard star ltt 3864 in the same observing run , but difficulties in dealing with strehl ratio variation on different nights and the inherent noisiness of large aperture ccd photometry made calibrations much less precise than using the denis photometry .",
    "however , we found consistent results to within 10% for the photometry for 1rxs 1609 a. this demonstrated that the primary is not a very active variable and that the denis @xmath28 band photometry is valid for the night of 2013 april 6 .    in the following analysis on the @xmath0 data , we selected frames with wavefront errors less than 175 nm rms , corresponding to the best two - thirds of data ( 129 frames ) .",
    "data reduction were as detailed in @xcite .",
    "we constructed a master point spread function ( psf ) from the unsaturated images and performed psf - fitting photometry .",
    "in addition , aperture photometry was done using an aperture of 1 fwhm in radius .",
    "our final @xmath0 flux is the average of both approaches , and its uncertainty included a @xmath50.1 mag offset between them . to estimate any possible flux loss in halo subtraction ,",
    "we subtracted scaled - down psfs at the position of the companion ( negative psf injection ) without removing the halo and found a consistent @xmath29 with our aperture and psf - fitting photometry .",
    "therefore , we concluded that there was no significant flux loss when removing the radially symmetric psf halo profile .",
    "the astrometric error budget also included image distortion @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we compare our @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements , together with the published @xmath75 spectra and photometry ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) , to the 1800  k phoenix - aces ( @xcite , @xcite ) , ames - dusty @xcite , and four l@xmath76 dwarfs in @xcite : 2mass j051846162756457 ( l1@xmath76 ) , 2mass j053619981920396 ( l2@xmath76 ) , 2mass j22081363 + 2921215 ( l3@xmath76 ) , and 2mass j050124060010452 ( l4@xmath76 ) . while the models and these l@xmath76 spectra fit 1rxs 1609 b reasonably well in the near - infrared , they all seem to be too bright at @xmath0 by a factor of @xmath524 , suggesting that some dust might be present to redden the companion . therefore , in this study we explore other possibilities .",
    "we carry out a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting using three atmospheric models : phoenix - aces , ames - dusty , and bt - settl @xcite .",
    "we adopt log _",
    "= 4.0 from previous analyses ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "then we apply the extinction law in @xcite and @xcite to redden these synthetic spectra . as in @xcite , to evaluate the goodness of fit , we match these reddened models with the observed @xmath57 flux because the @xmath77 band is most likely dominated by photospheric emission and least affected by dust emission and extinction . in general , we find that the reddened phoenix - aces synthetic spectra give the best fit , followed by the bt - settl and ames - dusty models .",
    "chi - square analysis gives @xmath78 , slightly higher than previous estimates .",
    "extinction is more model dependent due to different treatments of opacity , varying from @xmath79 to 5.3 mag at this temperature range , so we compute a weighted average and adopt @xmath3 mag .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] also shows our sed fitting with models added @xmath80 and 4.5 mag .",
    "we note that these fluxes are not absolute in order to avoid the @xmath510% distance uncertainty .",
    "we also normalize the companion s @xmath75 spectra ( gray curves ) to their apparent fluxes .",
    "the red curves are normalized at the apparent @xmath57 flux , while the blue curves represent the object s true sed when extinction is not present .",
    "overall these reddened models fit the photometry and spectra reasonably well .",
    "the @xmath81 @xmath1 upper limit also suggests that 1rxs 1609 b is likely obscured , otherwise we would have detected it .",
    "we also notice that the system has an unresolved 24 @xmath6 m excess of 0.91 mjy @xcite .",
    "since the primary star has very little extinction , @xmath82 mag @xcite , it is possible that most of this warm dust excess originates from the companion . as mentioned in the introduction , @xcite found that 1rxs 1609 b and a few other objects exhibit @xmath10 excess , which indicates that disks may be common to young substellar companions . in figure [ fig2 ] there is evidence ( @xmath832  @xmath50 ) of a weak @xmath520% 34  @xmath6 m excess compared with our best - fit seds .",
    "in addition , in figure [ fig3 ] we find that 1rxs 1609 b has @xmath84 redder than field l dwarfs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the sed appears to need pure ism - like reddening ( @xmath72 mag ) , in contrast to the gray extinction usually invoked in atmospheric planetary models with thick clouds ( e.g. , hr 8799 b , @xcite ; 2 m 1207 b , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "all of these lines of evidence seem to suggest that 1rxs 1609 b hosts its own inclined dust disk . really , this is not a surprising result given that @xmath525% of low - mass objects in upper sco have dusty disks @xcite and 1rxs 1609 b was the faintest , reddest object found by the discoverers ao survey of upper sco @xcite , so the odds are good that the faintest , reddest object might also have dust extinction as well  making 1rxs 1609 b appear redder and fainter than its intrinsic true color and luminosity .      we calculate four gravity - insensitive indices @xmath85o , @xmath85od , @xmath85o-1 , and @xmath85o-2 as defined in @xcite .",
    "the average of these indices shows @xmath5l2 for @xmath38 between 3 and 6 mag , earlier than previous estimates of l@xmath86 ( @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our result is also in agreement with the recent analysis by @xcite , who fit an l2@xmath76 spectra to that of 1rxs 1609 b. therefore , we adopt l@xmath34 .    with @xmath3 mag and @xmath87  pc ,",
    "we calculate log(@xmath88 using the bolometric correction in @xcite .",
    "to validate , we integrate the de - reddened spectra in figure [ fig2 ] and obtain @xmath89 , suggesting that the bolometric correction derived from field dwarfs works reasonably well for young objects .",
    "compared to the dusty evolutionary tracks ( @xcite ; see figure [ fig4 ] ) , the companion has a mass between 0.012 and 0.015  @xmath4 , consistent with @xcite but higher than 0.0080.011  @xmath4 found in other studies .",
    "therefore , we suggest that 1rxs 1609 b likely lies above the fiducial brown dwarf / planet boundary .        if 1rxs 1609 b harbors an inclined disk , this will imply that circumsubstellar disks could survive after 10 myr .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected because the recent large infrared survey in the upper sco revealed longer disk lifetimes for low - mass stars @xcite .",
    "the survival of disks also supports in situ fragmentation for companions on wide orbits and disfavors the planet ",
    "planet scattering scenario .",
    "since no accretion - indicating lines were detected in the nir spectrum , ongoing accretion is either slow or non - existent .",
    "the putative disk may be largely gas depleted , precluding accretion , while still retaining sufficient dust mass at larger radii to produce the observed extinction .",
    "future alma observations could definitively test the existence of this disk .",
