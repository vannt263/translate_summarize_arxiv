    "the first extra - solar x - ray source discovered was the low - mass x - ray binary sco  x-1 @xcite .",
    "its optical counterpart , v818  sco , was discovered by @xcite , paving the way for many subsequent multiwavelength studies . the binary period is widely accepted to be 18.9hr based on the discovery of a photometric modulation by @xcite and spectroscopic confirmation by @xcite .",
    "we now know that sco  x-1 contains a low - mass late - type donor transferring mass onto a neutron star at a rather high rate .",
    "the modulation arises from x - ray heating of the donor star , which also manifests as narrow emission lines of niii and ciii moving in phase with the donor star @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained the period of @xmath0days quite remarkably by examining archival photographic plates from 1889 to 1974 .",
    "a sinusoidal modulation of full amplitude around 0.20.3mag was found in several independent datasets , with considerable scatter around the mean curve @xcite .",
    "while the long baseline of photographic observations defined the period to incredible precision , the sparse sampling left a plethora of aliases , and @xcite identified strong signals at one - day , one - month , and one - year aliases of their favored period .",
    "of these , the one - year alias has been by far the hardest to reject .",
    "several subsequent photometric studies reproduced the modulation , but none improved the ephemeris , or resolved the one - year alias issue @xcite    spectroscopic confirmation of this period was suggested by @xcite and @xcite , and demonstrated conclusively by @xcite , who found a period of @xmath1days , and again by @xcite .",
    "both of these works performed a period search on the data , but in both cases the frequency resolution was limited by only observing over a baseline of a week .",
    "other spectroscopic analyses of these and other data have also found variations at this period , @xcite , but no other groups have performed a rigorous independent period search .",
    "several groups also searched for the orbital period in x - ray data , with initially no success @xcite .",
    "the only positive detection of an orbital period in x - rays came from @xcite based on a multi - year _",
    "rxte_/asm dataset .",
    "they did not find exactly the @xcite period , but instead the one - year alias ( 0.78893days ) with a modulation around 1% .",
    "given the intensive multi - year coverage of _ rxte _ this is surprising , since this dataset should not be susceptible to the one - year alias problem .",
    "@xcite therefore claimed that their period was the true orbital period and that @xcite had misidentified the alias .",
    "while this result was tantalizing , @xcite could not reproduce this period using a larger _ rxte _ dataset .",
    "they did , however , not use as sophisticated an analysis as @xcite , leaving open the possibility that the x - ray period could be real .",
    "surprisingly , then , fifty years after discovery of the prototypical lmxb sco  x-1 , there remain doubts about its most fundamental parameter , the orbital period .",
    "while the original optical ephemeris of @xcite has remained the standard reference for the 37years since its publication , it remains to be resolved whether this , or the x - ray period of @xcite , is the true orbital period . to attempt to resolve these questions , and update the ephemeris of sco  x-1 with modern data , we examine here archival photometry from the all sky automated survey ( asas )",
    "this nine year dataset has both the long baseline to determine a precise period , and coverage of a large enough fraction of a year to finally break the one - year alias problem using optical data .",
    "the all sky automated survey ( asas ) monitored sco  x-1 from 2001 to 2009 @xcite . we note that while sco  x-1 was not included in the asas catalog of variable stars ( acvs ) its photometry is in the asas-3 photometric @xmath2 band catalog in two datasets , 1619551538.4 and 1619551538.5 .",
    "the sco x-1 datasets include 640 observations from 2001 january 22 to 2009 october 5 . with multiyear coverage spanning typically about 270days of the year , it is ideally suited for obtaining an updated ephemeris and breaking the one - year alias .",
    "we performed our analysis for a range of choices of data grades and apertures to optimize our filter criteria . for final analysis , we retained the 567 grade a or b observations , and used the smallest asas aperture .",
    "inclusion of grade c or worse data , or use of larger aperture data , significantly reduced the quality of the fits .",
    "to determine the orbital period we performed a sinuoidal fit to the data points . since the scatter around the model is dominated by intrinsic flickering rather than photometric uncertainties , we assigned a mean uncertainty of 0.30mag to each point to represent the flickering .",
    "this was chosen to produce a minimum @xmath3 equal to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we then evaluated sinusoidal fits over a range of trial periods . for each period the best - fitting mean magnitude , amplitude , and phasing were determined using the downhill simplex algorithm @xcite .",
    "we show the results in the vicinity of the disputed periods in fig .",
    "[ periodfig ] .     as a function of trial period for sinusoidal fits to asas data .",
    "we show the @xcite period of 0.787313days and the @xcite period of 0.78893days for comparison .",
    "we also show calculated one - year aliases of the preferred period at 0.78562 and 0.78901days .",
    "the @xcite period is strongly favored by the asas data . while some signal is seen at the alternative periods , all are rejected at greater than 5-@xmath4 confidence.,width=336 ]    we see that the @xcite period is reproduced exactly to within the limits of our frequency resolution . our formal best period is @xmath5days .",
    "the uncertainty quoted is a formal 1-@xmath4 error determined from the @xmath6 confidence range in period .",
    "we verified the uncertainty using the bootstrap method with 30 resamplings of the data .",
    "this gave a consistent 1-@xmath4 uncertainty ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we also show the period of @xcite , and the one - year aliases with which they associated it .",
    "we find that none of these alternatives are consistent with the asas data , and all can be rejected at better than 5-@xmath4 confidence .",
    "we therefore can not directly improve on the period of @xcite using the asas data , which is not surprising as that used data drawn from nearly a hundred year baseline .",
    "we can , however , overcome the limitation of that dataset in its vulnerability to one - year aliases , as the asas data has much wider coverage within a year .",
    "using the same @xmath3 approach , we determine a mean time of minimum of @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to an offset of very close to 17057 cycles from the time of minimum of @xcite .",
    "if we project their time of minimum forwards we predict @xmath9 , with equal contributions to the uncertainty from their time of minimum ( quoted as 0.022 cycles ) and their period ( @xmath10days ) .",
    "our time of minimum is completely consistent with theirs ( a remarkable testament to the accuracy of their historical ephemeris ) , but at this point our modern measurement of the time is somewhat better constrained for use with modern data .    finally , we show in figure  [ lightcurvefig ] the asas lightcurve folded on our derived ephemeris , together with the best fitting sine wave .",
    "the mean @xmath2 band brightness is 12.63 , and the full - amplitude is 0.26mag , comparable to that found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have established that in optical photometry the 0.787313day period produces a stable modulation over 120years of observation .",
    "the ephemeris of @xcite reliably and precisely predicts the time of minimum in the asas data , over 17,000 intervening cycles .",
    "it is hard to imagine any clock other than the orbital period providing this stability .",
    "this has to be the true orbital period .",
    "the question then arises as to what , if anything , @xcite detected .",
    "we of course should allow that it was a spurious detection , until it can be reproduced with data from the remainder of the _ rxte _ mission .",
    "@xcite failed to reproduce it , but also did not use all the techniques that @xcite used . associating it with an alias of the true orbital period seems unlikely , as _",
    "rxte_/asm data on sco  x-1 are rather well sampled through the year ( just as asas data are )",
    ".    one possible explanation might be if the x - ray signal came at the beat frequency between the orbital period and a superorbital period of around a year .",
    "many x - ray binaries have indeed shown super - orbital periods of tens to hundreds of days ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although typically all are shorter than a year .",
    "the only claim of such a long period in sco  x-1 , came from early _",
    "rxte_/asm data , from which @xcite suggested a 37day period .",
    "this detection has not been sustained in subsequent data , and no super - orbital period was found by @xcite in _ swift_/bat data . on longer timescales , @xcite and @xcite both independently suggested a @xmath11year x - ray modulation is present in _ rxte_/asm data , although this is too long to account for the @xcite period .",
    "this explanation therefore seems unlikely , and it remains to be seen if the x - ray period can be reproduced from the full _ rxte _ mission - long dataset .",
    "we have analyzed asas data of sco  x-1 spanning nine years .",
    "we can confirm the period of @xcite , while rejecting its one - year aliases , and also the putative x - ray period of @xcite .",
    "our updated ephemeris is @xmath12 ."
