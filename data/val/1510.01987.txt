    "power law - like size distributions of extreme events have been discovered over the last 30 years in a large number of astrophysical phenomena in many wavelengths , such as hard x - ray and gamma - ray bursts from solar and stellar flares , auroral emission and geomagnetic substorms from planetary magnetospheres , particle events from radiation belts , pulsar glitches , soft gamma - ray repeaters , blazars , black - hole objects , cosmic rays , to boson clouds ( for a recent review see aschwanden et al .",
    "2015 and references therein ) .    a unifying concept to explain and model",
    "these observed power law distributions is the concept of _ self - organized criticality ( soc ) _ in slowly - driven nonlinear dissipative systems , originally proposed by bak , tang and wiesenfeld ( 1987 ; btw ) and katz ( 1986 ) .",
    "the soc concept is a very interdisciplinary subject , being applied in astrophysics ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2015 ) , geophysics ( turcotte 1999 ) , as well as in financial physics ( feigenbaum 2003 ) , and social sciences ( galam 2012 ) .",
    "on the most general level , the common denominator of all soc processes in different science disciplines is the statistics of scale - free nonlinear processes , which can be characterized by a nonlinear growth phase , during which coherent growth is enabled and has multiplicative characteristics , in contrast to linear processes with incoherent and additive characteristics .",
    "incoherent random processes exhibit binomial , gaussian , poissonian , or exponential distribution functions , while coherent processes exhibit scale - free power law - like distributions .",
    "this is the fundamental property that earthquakes , solar flares , or stock market crashes have in common , although the underlying physical mechanisms are fundamentally different .",
    "soc behavior can also be simulated by mathematical rules , as it is demonstrated with cellular automaton models ( pruessner 2012 ) .",
    "consequently , there is both ( i ) an universally valid statistical aspect of soc systems that leads to scale - free power law - like size distributions , and ( ii ) physical scaling laws that are specific to each particular soc phenomenon .",
    "physical scaling laws can often be expressed in terms of variables that are coupled to each other in a multiplicative way by ( nonlinear ) exponents , from which the power law slopes of the observed size distributions can be calculated .",
    "power law size distributions are the hallmarks of self - organized criticality ( soc ) systems , and therefore the determination of the power law slope @xmath5 is an important quest , but power law fitting is not trivial because of a number of deviations that are not properly understood .",
    "while the standard soc models call for an ideal power law distribution function , it was rigorously proven with maximum likelihood fitting methods with goodness - of - fit tests based on the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic that most observed size distributions of empirical data are not consistent with an ideal power law , a power law with a cutoff , an exponential , a stretched exponential , or a log - normal distribution function ( clauset et al .",
    "some sceptics went even as far as to deny the existence of power laws at all ( stumpf and porter 2012 ) . here",
    "we propose to add a threshold constant to the ideal power law function , which describes a physical threshold , an instrumental sampling threshold , or a background contamination , which appears to fit a large number of observed ( power law - like ) size distributions .",
    "the introduction of a threshold constant allows us to fit an observed size distribution over a larger range without having to make any assumption of an arbitrarily chosen scale - free range over which a power law can be fitted .",
    "we will test this concept with terrestrial , solar , and astrophysical data sets , some of them investigated previously ( clauset et al .",
    "2009 ; aschwanden et al .",
    "we use the term _ thresholded power law size distribution _ throughout the paper , which is also known in the statistical literature as _ `` generalized pareto distribution '' _ ( hosking and wallis 1987 ) , `` generalized pareto type ii distribution '' ( e.g. , arnold 2015 ; johnson et al .",
    "1994 ) , or `` lomax distribution '' ( lomax 1954 ) .",
    "this paper is organized into a theoretical section on the definition of thresholded size distributions , for differential and cumulative occurrence frequency distributions ( section 2 ) , a description of the data analysis method ( section 3 ) , analysis of terrestrial , solar , and astrophysical data sets ( section 4 ) , a discussion of the results ( section 5 ) , and conclusions ( section 6 ) .",
    "virtually all nonlinear energy dissipation processes in astrophysics are governed by some instability , which all have a distinct threshold .",
    "these systems are stable as long as the conditions remain below some critical threshold , while the onset of an instability is triggered when a critical threshold is locally exceeded .",
    "we list a selection of common stabilities that occur in solar and astrophysical plasmas in table 1 , and visualize their physical mechanisms in fig .  1 , including mostly hydrodynamic , magneto - hydrodynamic , and kinetic instabilities ( for references see textbooks , e.g. , krall and trivelpeace 1971 ; cowling 1976 ; schmidt 1979 ; melrose 1980a , b , 1986 ; priest 1982 ; benz 1993 ; sturrock 1994 ; kivelson and russell 1995 ; baumjohann and treumann 1996 ; treumann and baumjohann 1997 ; somov 2000 ; priest and forbes 2000 ; biskamp 2000 ; tajima and shibata 2002 ; goossens 2003 ; aschwanden 2004 ; bellan 2006 ) .",
    "for the onset of an instabiltiy to be triggered ( fig .",
    "2 left ) , the threshold condition could be a critical density gradient ( rayleigh - taylor instability ) , a critical velocity gradient ( kelvin - helmholtz instability ) , a critical lorentz force ( ballooning instability , resistive instabilities , current pinch instabilities ) , a critical temperature gradient ( thermal instabilities ) , or a critical gradient in the particle velocity distribution ( bump - in - tail , two - stream , or loss - cone instabilities ) .",
    "these instabilities play a fundamental role for the generation of most astrophysical phenomena , such as the formation of supermassive black holes triggered by a global dynamical instability ( begelman et al .",
    "2006 ) , the formation of galactic dark matter structures by a gravitational instabilty ( springel et al .",
    "2005 ) , star formation by a gravitational instability ( wang and silk 1994 ) , giant planet formation by a gravitational instability ( boss 1997 ) , solar flares by magnetic reconnection instabilities ( priest and forbes 2000 ) , such as by the kink - mode or tearing mode instability , solar radio bursts by wave - particle interactions and kinetic instabilities ( benz 1993 ) , coronal loop evolution by thermal instabilities ( priest 1978 ) , auroral kilometric radiation bursts from planets by the electron - cyclotron loss - cone instability ( wu and lee 1979 ) , or magnetospheric substorms by velocity shear - related instabilities ( lui 1991 ) .",
    "since instabilities can not occur without crossing a critical threshold , instability thresholds are an essential ingredient in the statistical distributions of observed astrophysical ( or terrestrial ) phenomena . in the next section we present a simple analytical model that predicts the statistical distribution of phenomena that are subject to an instability that operates above some physically defined threshold value .",
    "there is a simple analytical model of nonlinear processes in terms of an exponential growth phase with saturation after a random time interval , which goes back to willis and yule ( 1922 ) who applied it to geographical distributions of plants and animals .",
    "yule s model was also applied to cosmic rays ( fermi 1949 ) , to cosmic transients and solar flares ( rosner and vaiana 1978 ; aschwanden et al .",
    "1998 ) , or to the growth dynamics of the world - wide web ( huberman and adamic 1999 ) , as well as to the distribution of the sizes of incomes , cities , internet files , biological taxa , and gene and protein families ( reed and hughes 2002 ) .",

    "the size of the avalanche is normalized to zero for avalanches starting at time @xmath6 .",
    "if the exponential growth process saturates after a random time interval @xmath9 , the statistical probability can be approximated with an exponential distribution function , @xmath10 where @xmath11 represents the e - folding saturation time .",
    "we can now invert eq .",

    "1994 ) , or `` lomax distribution '' ( lomax 1954 ) , to which we refer as _ thresholded power law size distribution _ in the remainder of this paper .",
    "such a distribution function is also called a _ differential occurrence frequency distribution function _ , a _",
    "log(n)-log(s ) _ diagram , or simply a _",
    "size distribution_.    the ideal power law ( or pareto ) distribution function of a parameter @xmath21 , with a power law coefficient @xmath22 that extends over a scale - free range of @xmath19 , can be retrieved from the generalized pareto distribution simply by setting @xmath23 in eq .",

    "a cumulative size distribution is simply defined by the integral of the total number of events above a given value @xmath21 , where @xmath26 represents the minimum value and @xmath27 the maximum value of the size distribution , over which the cdf is integrated .",
    "for the ideal power law distribution function ( eq .  7 ) we have , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the total number of events included in the size distribution . strictly speaking ,",
    "this definition is only valid for exponents @xmath30 , while the integral takes on the form of @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",
    "note that this distribution has an asymptotic value of @xmath33 at the lower bound , and vanishes at the upper bound , @xmath34 .",
    "it is important to note that the cumulative size distribution ( eq .  9 ) is not exactly a power law function with a slope of @xmath35 , but rather shows a steep drop - off at the upper end like an exponential function , due to the highest value that forces the probability to vanish above @xmath27 .",
    "it is a consequence of the fact that the differential size distribution has a sharp upper bound at @xmath27 and does not continue to infinity , an effect that is also called a _",
    "finite system size effect _ in soc models .",
    "this deviation from a straight power law ( of the cumulative size distribution ) is often ignored , or is modeled with an _ ad hoc _ ( exponential ) term , i.e. , @xmath36 ( e.g. , lu et al .  1993 ) , but we will fit it properly to the data in this study by fitting the exact analytical distribution function defined in eq .  ( 9 ) ( see examples in figs .",
    "3c and 3d ) .",
    "the thresholded size distribution has the follwoing cdf , @xmath37 the bounds @xmath38 $ ] and the number of events @xmath29 are known in principle , which leaves two free variables ( @xmath39 ) . from the definition given in eq .",
    "( 10 ) we see immediately that the cumulative size distribution obtains the value @xmath40 at the lower bound @xmath41 , and @xmath42 at the upper bound @xmath43 .",

    "further examples of such size distributions with different power law slopes @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "( 4b ) and ( 4d ) .",
    "the low end of a power law - like distribution function often shows a deviation from an ideal power law function in form of a gradual rollover , which is caused by undersampling below the detection threshold .",
    "the detection threshold is a different physical cause than the instability threshold @xmath0 derived in section 2.2 , but can be mathematically treated in the same way .",
    "therefore , the ( positively - defined ) parameter @xmath3 in the thresholded size distribution ( eq .  5 ) has a double meaning , it could be caused by the physical threshold of the relevant instability , or it could be caused by the finite sensitivity of an instrument .",
    "this ambiguity can only be resolved by using additional information .",
    "for instance , if a data set with higher sensitivity is used , the value @xmath0 should move to lower values ( fig .  2 right ) , while it should stay constant for a physical instability threshold that is instrument - independent ( see effect of instability threshold @xmath47 and detection threshold @xmath48 on cumulative size distribution in fig .  2 right panel ) .",
    "actually , the parameter @xmath0 has a third meaning , if it is negative , @xmath4 . in any size distribution of a certain type of events , it is always possible to have an event - unrelated background that is responsible for false detections at the level of the smallest events .",
    "in particular in astrophysical data sets , the flux @xmath49 of events that is sampled may often contain some event - unrelated background @xmath50 , so that the total observed flux @xmath51 represents an over - estimate of the event - related flux @xmath49 .",
    "for instance , hard x - ray pulses originating from solar flares always contain some background photons of the same energy that originate from non - solar sources ( such as the galactic background ) .",
    "such a background contamination effect has the same functional form as a thresholded power law distribution function ( eq .  5 ) , @xmath52 except that the offset constant @xmath53 is negative . a set of differential size distributions @xmath14 ( for @xmath54 ) is shown in fig .",
    "( 3a ) , as well as the corresponding set of cumulative size distributions @xmath45 ( fig .",
    "further examples of such size distributions for different power law slopes @xmath46 are shown in fig .",
    "( 4a ) and ( 4c ) .",
    "we see that the lower end of the size distributions show a steepening of the power law slope , while a cutoff occurs at @xmath55 . in practice",
    ", the background @xmath56 may not be a constant value for each event , but for sake of simplicity we study here only the zero - order effect of a constant background value .",
    "after we described the theoretical framework of thresholded power law distributions ( section 2.2 , 2.3 ) , and the effect of incomplete sampling ( section 2.4 ) and background contamination ( section 2.5 ) , we turn now to the numerical method to fit these modified power law distribution functions to data sets and to evaluate a goodness - of - fit criterion .",
    "we will use monte - carlo simulations to validate the numerical method used here .",
    "we start with monte - carlo simulations of generalized ( thresholded ) power law distributions of the form of eq .",

    "application of physical models to these measurements are beyond the scope of this paper and will be conducted elsewhere .",
    "considering the relatively small number statistics of stellar flares , the measurement of power law slopes is challenging , since the rollover due to undersampling causes a flattening at the lower end of the distribution , and the finite - size effect causes a steepening at the upper end of the distribution , and there is almost no intervening range where the power law slope can be reliably measured .",
    "it is therefore imperative to model and fit all three effects simultaneously .",
    "stumpf and porter ( 2012 ) write in their article _ critical truths about power laws _ : _  a striking feature that has attracted considerable attention is the apparent ubiquity of power law relationships in empirical data . however , although power laws have been reported in areas ranging from finance and molecular biology to geophysics and the internet , the data are typically insufficient and the mechanistic insights are almost too limited for the identification of power law behavior to be scientifically useful . _",
    " this sceptical remark echoed similar thoughts made in an extensive study on _ power - law distributions in empirical data _",
    "( clauset et al .  2009 ) , from which we quote : _ unfortunately , the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution  the part of the distribution representing large but rare events  and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power law behavior holds .",
    "commonly used methods for analyzing power law data , such as least - square fitting , can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power law distributions , and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all .",
    " clauset et al .  (",
    "2009 ) combine maximum - likelihood fitting methods with goodness - of - fit tests based on the kolmogorov - smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios , and find that the hypothesis of a power law is consistent with data in some cases , while it is ruled out in other cases .",
    "given these problematics , we identify three major problems : ( 1 ) insufficient statistics , ( 2 ) the definition of the fitting range , and ( 3 ) the choice of the model .",
    "the first problem can be overcome by using more sensitive instruments that can sample events down to a lower level , or by increasing the observing time span , which boosts the number of detected events proportionally to the total duration of observations .",
    "both trends are ameliorated currently , because high - technology developments provide us with more sensitive instruments in almost all areas , and data sets are now available over decades of years , since automated measurements started around 1950 . in particular for solar and astrophysical measurements ,",
    "the beginning of the space age after 1956 has opened up the capabilities to sample large data sets with space - borne instruments in virtually all wavelengths .",
    "the second problem of defining a fitting range for power law distributions represents a methodical problem that can be solved systematically , as we demonstrate in this paper .",
    "it is true that most power law fits in the past have been carried out by eye - balling a straight portion of a size distribution on a log - log scale , and then applying a linear regression fit to the logarithmic histogram in this `` scale - free '' range . while such measurements with a clearly visible power law range @xmath172 $ ] are still reasonably accurate , the problem becomes ill - defined when the power law slope gradually varies from a flat segment at the lower end [ @xmath26 ] to a steepening edge at the upper end @xmath174 $ ] ) ( for examples see fig .",
    "6.1 and 6.2 in clauset et al .",
    "2009 ) . in principle",
    ", one could quantify the problem by subdividing a size distribution into three zones , bound by the values @xmath175 , where the middle part @xmath172 $ ] is fitted with a power law function , while the lower @xmath176 $ ] and upper zone @xmath177 $ ] are fitted with appropriate other model functions ( as visualized in fig .  2 , right panel ) .",
    "however , such a method would still fail for data sets with small - number statistics , because the pure power law range @xmath178 $ ] shrinks to arbitrary small ranges ( see examples of flare events for single stars ( figs .",
    "14 - 15 ; second and third row ) .",
    "the third problem , the choice of the model , is discussed in the next section , where we argue which most likely effects should be included in models of power law - like distribution functions .",
    "the ideal solution of model fitting is always a complete model that includes all measurements or data points , quantified with a minimum number of free parameters ( occam s razor criterion ) . for our size distribution",
    "fitting problem , this means that a complete model should describe not only the power law part in the range @xmath178 $ ] , but also the flattening in the lower portion @xmath176 $ ] and the steepening in the upper portion @xmath177 $ ] .",
    "we accomplish this goal simply by adding a threshold @xmath0 to the pure power law function , i.e. , @xmath179 ( eq .  5 ) , which serves a three - fold purpose :",
    "( 1 ) @xmath0 quantifies a lower threshold above which a data set is completely sampled ; ( 2 ) @xmath0 could represent also a critical physical threshold of an instability ( in terms of an exponentially growing avalanche ) ; and ( 3 ) @xmath136 can also be used to subtract an event - unrelated background @xmath56 from the data before fitting of a model function is applied .",
    "furthermore , the largest event @xmath27 of the data set represents a sharp cutoff in the differential size distribution , which produces a gradual steepening in the cumulative size distribution ( eq .  10 ) , which has to drop to zero for values @xmath180 . fitting the correctly integrated cumulative size distribution ( eq .  10 )",
    "will then take care of the steepening near the upper end of the observed size distribution .",
    "how successful is this new method of thresholded power laws ?",
    "first of all , this method involves only one more free parameter ( @xmath0 ) than fitting a straight power law distribution function ( with two variables @xmath18 and @xmath104 ) , and thus it follows occam s razor criterion .",
    "if we look at the 9 empirical data sets in fig .  9 , we find that a thresholded power law is consistent with the data ( @xmath181 ) in 4 out of the 9 cases , for which it yields accurate power law slopes .",
    "in contrast , two cases are clearly not consistent ( cities and fires ) , which probably could be fitted with a broken power law , indicating two different scaling regimes . regarding the interpretation of these 9 empirical data sets , we can certainly consider solar ( flares ) and geophysical phenomena ( earthquakes and forest fires ) as thresholded instabilities , as it was proposed for self - organized criticality phenomena , while phenomena in sociophysics ( city growth , power blackouts , terrorism attacks , stockmarket bubbles ) have the statistics of extreme events in common , and information - type phenomena ( words , surnames , weblinks ) have the multiplicative behavior of combinational processes in common ( such as in branching theory or percolation processes ) .    for solar flare data",
    "the thresholded power law model is consistent with all data sets ( hxrbs , batse , rhessi ) regarding the peak count rate and total counts ( fig .",
    "11 ) , while the size distributions for flare durations show some slight deviations , which could indicate a bimodality between short and long - duration flares .",
    "this is not surprising , because the duration of long - lasting flares ( several hours ) is less well - defined due to interruptions from the spacecraft orbit , and due to confusion of time - overlapping flare events .    for stellar flare data we find consistency ( @xmath182 ) of the thresholded power law model for all size distributions , for stellar flares that are combined from many stars ( figs .",
    "14 - 15 ; top row ) , as well as for flare events from single stars ( figs .",
    "14 - 15 ; second and third row ) .",
    "this agreement is partially helped by the unavoidable small - number statistics , but it holds up to samples with 1538 flare events observed with kepler ( fig .",
    "14 - 15 ; top row ) .    in summary",
    ", the thresholded power law seems to fit almost every data set , and thus does not justify additional free model parameters .",
    "the only two clear - cut deviations from a power law model are found for the cases of city sizes and forest fires , which may indeed reveal multiple scaling ranges , similar to multi - fractals in the geometric domain ( kelty - stephen et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "in this study we applied the thresholded power law model to both the differential and the cumulative size distribution functions .",
    "what do we learn from comparing these two methods ?",
    "in principle we expect a higher accuracy for cumulative size distribution functions , because they always contain more datapoints per bin than the differential size distribution by definition .",
    "one difference is that the number of datapoints per bin is independent in the differential size distribution , while it is not for cumulative distributions .",
    "nevertheless , our monte - carlo simulations have proven that a goodness - of - fit criterion can be defined for both methods ( eqs .",
    "18 - 19 ) , which both have a mean value of @xmath125 for random noise ( although the value @xmath183 is slightly lower for cumulative distributions , see fig .",
    "5d ) . applying both methods to the data , we find that the goodness - of - fit has the tendency to produce better fits for the cumulative size distributions than for the differential size distributions .",
    "an important test is whether the two methods yield consistent values of power law slopes .",
    "we show the power law slope values @xmath184 with errors in fig .",
    "16 , which exhibits an excellent agreement between the differential ( fig .",
    "16 , x - axis ) and the cumulative distribution values ( fig .  16 ,",
    "y = axis ) . of course ,",
    "the actual slope @xmath185 of a cumulative distribution function is flatter by one , i.e. , @xmath126 .",
    "the consistency of the two methods is largely obtained because both methods use the same threshold value @xmath0 and thus an identical subset of events for the fits .",
    "if the threshold @xmath0 is determined independently with the two methods , a discrepancy in the resulting power law slope values @xmath104 would be unavoidable .",
    "in our study it was necessary to use both fitting procedures simultaneously , because the differential size distribution defines a more reliable threshold value @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "6 ) , while the cumulative size distribution appears to give better fits to the thresholded power law function ( with a lower goodness - of - fit value @xmath70 ) .",

    "an early application of this model is the accleration of cosmic ray particles ( fermi 1949 ) , while later applications considered accelerated particles , magnetic reconnection , and nonpotential energy build - up in solar flares as avalanching processes ( rosner and vaiana 1978 ; aschwanden et al .",

    "2015 ) .",

    "since we have proven in this work that we can measure power law indices of observed size distributions down to an accuracy of @xmath203 , we may refute the claim of stumpf and porter ( 2012 ) that the data are insufficient for the identification of power law behavior to be scientifically useful .",

    "deviations from ideal power laws have been noted at the lower end , where often a smooth rollover occurs due to incomplete sampling at the sensitivity limit , and at the upper end , where a steepening in the cumulative size distribution occurs due to the cutoff of the largest event .    in this study",
    "we modify the ideal power law function by adding a constant @xmath0 , which has a three - fold meaning ; ( 1 ) as a physical threshold of an instability ( or exponentially growing avalanche process ) ; and ( 2 ) as a sensitivity threshold for complete sampling ; and ( 3 ) as a correction term for data samples that are contaminated by event - unrelated background noise .",
    "in addition we define an upper bound @xmath27 by the largest event , which represents a sharp cutoff in the differential size distribution and causes a gradual steepening at the upper end of the cumulative size distribution . with the introduction of these modifications we can fit most of the observed size distributions , as we tested with 9 mostly terrestrial data sets , 9 solar flare data sets ( from the hxrbs , batse , rhessi missions ) , and 9 stellar flare data sets ( from the kepler mission ) .",
    "we like to point out that the `` thresholded power law model '' used here is motivated by physical arguments ( instability threshold , detection threshold , background noise ) , while alternative mathematical functions , such as power laws with an exponential cutoff , exponential functions , stretched exponentials , or log - normal functions , which all have been used in fitting of empirical data ( clauset et al .",
    "2009 ) , may have been chosen for mathematical convenience , rather than based on a specific physical model .",
    "our recommended procedure to fit power laws in data sets consists of the following four steps : ( 1 ) histogram binning of both the differential and cumulative size distributions over the entire data range @xmath38 $ ] ; ( 2 ) determination of a threshold @xmath0 from the bin with the maximum number of events in the differential size distribution ; ( 3 ) elimination of event - unrelated background @xmath56 by adjusting broken power laws to a straight power law in the fitting range @xmath120 $ ] ; and ( 4 ) least - square fit by varying the power law slope @xmath104 and normalization constant @xmath18 in the fitting range @xmath120 $ ] , with evaluation of the goodness - of - fit criterion that reveals whether the thresholded power law model is consistent with the data or not .",
    "the practical value of our thresholded power law model is reflected in a number of applications .",
    "extreme events of solar flares , space weather storms , earthquakes , forest fires , blackouts , and terrorism are of high interest for forecasting and mitigation of human risks and damage of electronic assets . statistics of extreme events of stellar flares , cosmic rays , pulsar glitches , and gamma - ray bursts allow us to test physical models operating under most violent conditions in astrophysical particle accelerators and high - temperature plasmas .",
    "measuring the power law slopes of multiple observables in an avalanching system , possibly governed by self - organized criticality , reveal us the degree of consistency with different models of physical scaling laws .",
    "the evaluation of threshold values is important for understanding the onset of instabilities and their triggers . in summary",
    ", there is a large number of applications in complexity theory and self - organized criticality models that benefit from reliable measurements of power law indices .",

    "<S> these effects can be modeled in simplest terms with a `` thresholded power law '' distribution function ( also called generalized pareto [ type ii ] or lomax distribution ) , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is positive for a threshold effect , while @xmath4 is negative for background contamination . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically derive the functional shape of this thresholded power law distribution function from an exponential - growth evolution model , which produces avalanches only when a disturbance exceeds a critical threshold @xmath0 . </S>",
