    "there have been tremendous progress in cosmology in the past decade .",
    "the availability of high quality observational data such as those from wmap @xcite has led to tight constraints on cosmological parameters and models .",
    "there is now a standard model of cosmology , in which only a small portion of the total mass - energy in the universe is ordinary matter , the rest being dark components which we have little understanding of . in some of the proposed dark matter models , such as sterile neutrino @xcite ,",
    "the dark matter particles may decay and emit photons @xcite , which are redshifted with the expansion of the universe and may eventually ionize hydrogen and helium at later times .",
    "therefore , decaying dark matter particles may contribute to reionization and imprint their signatures on the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( cmba ) . in this paper",
    ", we constrain the mass and life time of decaying dark matter particles by using the wmap data of cmba .",
    "there are strong evidences for reionization at late universe @xcite , many sources of which have been proposed , such as star formation @xcite , uv radiation from black holes @xcite , and supernova - driven winds @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that the x - ray photons produced in the decays of sterile neutrinos can boost the production of molecular hydrogen , and as a result the rates of cooling of gas and early star formation are increased , leading to reionization at redshift consistent with the wmap results .",
    "@xcite use extragalactic diffuse x - ray background to constrain the decay rate of sterile neutrinos as a warm dark matter candidate .",
    "@xcite use the ly - alpha forest power spectrum measured by the sloan digital sky survey and high - resolution spectroscopy observations in combination with wmap data and galaxy clustering to constrain sterile neutrino masses .",
    "the lower limits obtained are 13.1 kev at 95% c.l . and 9.0 kev at 99.9% c.l .. in @xcite",
    ", decaying dark matter is also considered to be an energy source of reionization .",
    "however several approximations are made in that paper ; in particular , the fraction of the decay energy deposited in baryonic gas is simply characterized by a phenomenological parameter . in this paper , we do not make approximations about the amount of energy absorbed by the baryons .",
    "the ionization and heating rates are calculated using the appropriate cross sections .",
    "furthermore , we vary both the decaying dark matter particle parameters and cosmological parameters to fit the cmba data , while in @xcite only the decaying dark matter particle parameters and the scalar amplitude are varied to fit the cmba spectrum .",
    "there is also another earlier work @xcite studying the effect on reionization by the decaying process of sterile neutrinos , where a relation between sterile neutrino mass and lifetime is used , which is based on the assumption that sterile neutrinos are the dominant component of dark matter .",
    "however in this paper we do not assume any relation between the decaying sterile neutrino mass and lifetime ; @xcite .",
    "] we treat them as two independent parameters instead , and we introduce another free parameter , the mass fraction of dark matter that are decaying , @xmath2 .",
    "the optical depth depends rather sensitively on the mass @xmath0 and life time @xmath1 of dark matter particles , as well as @xmath2 .",
    "however , to good approximation , the effects of @xmath2 and @xmath1 are degenerate and only their ratio is an independent parameter .",
    "we then constrain these parameters , @xmath0 and @xmath5 by the wmap 7-year data .",
    "assuming that such a decaying process is the only source of reionization , 6 is highly controversial , as it is very sensitive to the assumed density field and continuum fitting @xcite .",
    "recently , direct and model - independent limits on the fraction of neutral hydrogen at z @xmath8 5 - 6 were obtained using the simple statistic of the covering fraction of dark pixels , and they can be consistent with the ionization history derived from cmba observations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , a recent work shows that model independent joint cmba - quasar absorption line constraints still permit a broad range of reionization history for @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "] we find that @xmath0 is less than about 1 mev , and @xmath5 is less than about @xmath10 , with the best - fit values being 17.3 kev and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "in section 2 , we present the calculation of the ionization fraction and optical depth in this decaying dark matter model .",
    "the markov chain monte carlo fitting to wmap data results and discussion are presented in section 3 , and section 4 is a summary and conclusion .",

    "for example , the photons from the dark matter decay affect other photons by first scattering with electrons which then scatter with other photons . also , very few dark matter particles have decayed by the time of recombination .",
