    "one usually introduces a triangulation of  @xmath83 equipped with piecewise - affine shape functions with compact support ( in analogy to the fe methodology , where the nodes are the repatoms ) .",
    "this triangulation is finely resolved ( to fully recover the underlying lattice ) in the region of interest and coarsely elsewhere .",

    "e.g.  @xcite or  @xcite . some similarities with the models for bond - sliding by  @xcite can be observed .",

    "equation   is therefore not included in further considerations and is left as a possible future challenge .",

    "[ subsect:6.3:fig:7a ] shows the local error  @xmath315 of eq .  .",
    "these results confirm that the size of the fully resolved region significantly influences the accuracy , whereas the choice of the summation rule has little effect on the local errors , except for mesh  @xmath336 .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that although the errors are acceptable ( below  @xmath340 ) , all qc approaches fail to identify in which bond the largest history variable occurs .",
    "this can be verified in fig .",

    "an analysis of the quasicontinuum  ( qc ) approach for regular lattice systems with internal dissipative processes is presented based on the variational , energy - consistent formulation of  @xcite .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the virtual - power - based qc method introduced by  @xcite can be equivalently derived from an appropriate energy potential . as both qc schemes satisfy the energy balance , the variational structure of the virtual - power - based qc method",
    "is confirmed by this study .",
    "2 .   as a consequence of the central summation rule , the number of internal variables is highly reduced .",
    "an alternative approach may be to introduce geometrical constraints for the internal variables , possibly allowing a unique reconstruction of all unknowns ( instead of only the kinematic variables ) .",
    "we have outlined briefly this perspective and emphasized the differences from the summation rule assumption .",
    "3 .   in the section describing the solution strategies , an alternating minimization method for nonsmooth potentials was specified for the qc framework .",
    "the example section has demonstrated the energy consistency of different qc schemes for three benchmark examples involving uniform loading , pure bending , and indentation test . in spite of large computational savings , all approximate solutions for all examples proved to be in a good agreement with the full - lattice solution in terms of stored and dissipated energies ( by accepting errors in energies only up to  @xmath20",
    ", the number of degrees of freedom may be reduced up to the factor of  @xmath339 ) .",
    "the presented variational qc framework generalizes the original energy - based conservative quasicontinuum methodology for an entire class of rate - independent interactions and can easily be adjusted to incorporate e.g. damage phenomena merely by appropriate modifications of the energies .",
    "in addition , our results provide a convenient framework for adaptive variational qc methods in regular lattice networks with dissipative interactions , with potential applications in , e.g. , fracture simulations of woven fabrics or polymers .",
    "all these topics are , nevertheless , beyond the scope of this contribution and will be reported separately .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we provide in this appendix the derivatives of  @xmath203 , recall eq .  , with respect to  @xmath130 explicitly .",
    "the internal force associated with atom  @xmath64 , @xmath341 , reads as @xmath342 where  @xmath343 denotes the reduced incremental site energy of atom  @xmath64 with condensed variable  @xmath158 , see also eqs .   and  .",
    "the global force is then expressed as @xmath344 note that if external force vector  @xmath11 is present , it is simply subtracted from the right - hand - side of eq .  .",
