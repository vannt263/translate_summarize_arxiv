    "in this report we assume that a signature for new physics is observed at a linear collider in the photon + missing energy channel , e^+e^- + .",
    "[ p311signal ] we analyze two possible interpretations of this signal .",
    "one possibility is in the context of the proposal of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add )  @xcite that we live in a world with extra spatial dimensions . in this proposal ,",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is resolved by assuming that the fundamental , higher - dimensional gravitational scale is around a tev .",
    "the apparent high value of the planck scale in the effective four - dimensional theory can be explained if the volume of the extra dimensions is large .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) degrees of freedom are confined to a four - dimensional manifold ( a `` brane '' ) in the full space - time , while gravitons can propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "if an extra - dimensional graviton is emitted in a particle collision , it would not be detected , leading to the signature of  .",
    "another possibility is in the context of an effective supersymmetric theory obtained from a spontaneously broken supergravity theory .",
    "if the scale of supersymmetry breaking is sufficiently low such theories will contain an extremely light gravitino , @xmath0  ev .",
    "gravitino pair production in conjunction with a photon will again produce the signature of  .    in this work",
    "we ask how well we can interpret a photon + missing energy signal .",
    "in particular , we would like to know whether one can distinguish between the two possibilities discussed above .",
    "we will also study if it is possible to distinguish between the add - type models with various numbers of extra dimensions .",
    "in theories with large extra dimensions , the missing energy in @xmath1 could be carried by the kaluza - klein(kk ) excitations of the gravitons .",
    "the differential cross - section is given by  @xcite@xcite : ( e^+e^- g ) =  s_n -1   ( ) ^n + 2 f(x _ , ) [ p311sezgg ] f(x , y)= . [ p311funz ] here @xmath2 is the fundamental mass scale , @xmath3 is the number of extra dimensions , @xmath4 is the surface area of an @xmath3-dimensional sphere of unit radius , @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the photon energy , and @xmath7 is the angle between the photon and beam directions .",
    "in supersymmetric theories with a superlight gravitino , photon + missing energy events could arise due to the pair - production of gravitinos , @xmath8 .",
    "the differential cross - section is given by  @xcite : = ( ) f_(x _ , ) [ p311eq : ggg1 ] f_(x , ) = 2(1-x)^2 [ p311eq : ggg ] where @xmath9 is the fine structure constant , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant , @xmath11 is the gravitino mass , @xmath12  is the photon scaled energy ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath7 is the polar angle .",
    "single photon plus missing energy events also occur within the sm due to escaping neutrinos . the sm background is @xmath14 , and can be obtained from numerous monte carlo packages , including pandora  @xcite .",
    "previous analyses  @xcite have carefully outlined the parameter spaces that produce a discernible excess of signal events over sm background in extra dimensional gravity models and in superlight gravitino models .",
    "we do not reproduce those results here , but are more interested in how similar or dissimilar the graviton - induced signal is to the gravitinos - induced signal .    to help us",
    "see the difference between the possible signal interpretations of single photon plus missing energy events at a linear collider , we have plotted in fig .",

    "the three solid lines are for the graviton kk signal with 2 , 4 and 6 extra dimensions . at @xmath16",
    "the ordering of the solid lines is @xmath17 highest , and @xmath18 lowest .",
    "the dashed line is the gravitino signal .",
    "the scales ( @xmath2 for the add - type models and @xmath11 for the supersymmetric model ) have been chosen so that the total cross sections within the applied kinematic cuts , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , are equal in all four cases .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ p311diffcs2 ] shows the normalized differential cross - sections of the four models as a function of @xmath15 , obtained by integrating with respect to @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath11 are tuned so that the total cross - section is the same for each model .",
    "the three solid lines are for the graviton kk signal with 2 , 4 and 6 extra dimensions . at @xmath16",

    "the dashed line is the gravitino signal . ]",
    "it is clear from the figures that both the recoil energy and angular distributions of the events are quite similar in all four cases .",
    "it is still possible , however , to use the photon energy distribution to discriminate between the add models with different values of @xmath3 . to do this",
    ", we perform a harder cut on the photon energy , @xmath23 .",
    "this is advantageous because in this region , the differences between cross sections with different @xmath3 do not change sign .",
    "we also perform an additional cut on @xmath21 to get rid of the peak in the standard model background associated with on - shell @xmath24 production . assuming that electron and positron beam polarizations of 80 and 60% respectively are achieved at a 500 gev linear collider , and that the cross section can be measured with 1% precision",
    ", we find that , for example , the case @xmath17 can be distinguished from @xmath25 for values of @xmath26 up to 4.6 tev .",
    "( if the uncertainty is purely statistical , 1% error on the cross section measurement corresponds to integrated luminosity of about 270 fb@xmath27 . )",
    "note , however , that the photon energy distributions for the cases of gravitino emission and @xmath18 add model are extremely close .",
    "it is not likely that the ambiguity between these two cases can be resolved by this measurement .",
    "we have also studied whether performing a more restrictive angular cut could help in distinguishing between the cases of gravitino and @xmath18 graviton emission . from fig .",
    "[ p311diffcs2 ] it appears that the two signals have discernible differences at small values of @xmath15 .",
    "we have found , however , that with the assumed 1% precision on the cross section measurement , this analysis will not be able to conclusively separate these two cases .",
    "another way to distinguish between models is by varying the collider center of mass energy @xmath28 .",
    "the tesla study  @xcite has shown that measuring cross sections at two design center of mass energies , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , allows to determine the number of extra dimensions in the add models for a wide range of parameters .",
    "for example , if there are two extra dimensions , the @xmath25 case can be excluded at 99% cl for values of @xmath26 up to 6.1 tev .",
    "the beam polarizations assumed in  @xcite coincide with the values chosen for our analyses here .",
    "while upgrading the linear collider energy from 500 gev to 800 gev , for example , will take much time , effort and money , the beam energy can be changed by as much as 5% without significantly disrupting the operation of the collider . therefore , it is interesting to study if different models can be distinguished by performing measurements at two center of mass energies separated by 5% .",
    "we have performed such a study using pandora .",
    "we have chosen the scales of each model so that their cross sections ( with the same cuts and polarizations as before ) are identical at @xmath31 gev , and evaluated their differences at @xmath32 gev . taking the standard model background into account and assuming that the cross sections at each energy can be measured with 1% precision , we find that the @xmath17 and @xmath25 cases can be distinguished at the 3@xmath33 level for @xmath34 tev .",
    "the sensitivity of this method is thus somewhat lower than for studying photon energy distributions .",
    "surprisingly , the scaling of the gravitino pair production cross section with @xmath28 is again identical to the @xmath18 add model .",
    "changing collider energy does not help in separating these two cases .",
    "we conclude that while the add models with @xmath35 can be distinguished from the supersymmetric models with light gravitino by carefully studying the photon + missing energy signal alone , this can not be done for the case of 6 extra dimensions .",
    "( let us note in passing that the missing energy signal in the @xmath18 add model is also identical to the one due to the emission of scalar states associated with the brane coordinates  @xcite . ) in this case , distinctions between the models will only occur with additional phenomena .",
    "the next - best observables in the extra - dimensional graviton model include the dimension - eight contact interactions  @xcite induced by e^+e^-g^(n ) , f|f , etc . , or from string regge states  @xcite .",
    "the superlight gravitino models are supersymmetric models , and the superpartner spectrum must satisfy the same naturnalness criteria as other supersymmetry ideas .",
    "the expectation is that some superpartner states , most notably charginos and neutralinos , should be accessible and well - studied at a 500 gev linear collider  @xcite .",
    "the kinematic reach for superpartners then approaches @xmath36 in @xmath37 collisions .",
    "an increase of the reach of selectrons is possible in @xmath38 collisions , since selectron masses approaching @xmath39 are kinematically accessible  @xcite .",
    "the full complement of observables will be needed to distinguish the precise underlying theory being discovered at the colliders .",
    "we would like to thank the organizers of the snowmass 2001 workshop where this work was initiated .",
    "we are grateful to many of the workshop s participants and especially to the members of the p3 and e3 working groups for interesting discussions .",
