    "random energy models on hierarchic trees are rather well - known and much investigated objects of statistical physics @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the tree is constructed via a deterministic branching process , starting from the root node and adding @xmath0 branches from every node of the tree , so that after k steps of the procedure there are @xmath1 nodes of the last generation ( the endpoints of the tree ) .",
    "one then associates random energy variables to every branch of the tree , and further attributes the random energy to every node of the last generation by adding up all the energy variables along the unique path connecting the given endpoint to the root . at the last step of the procedure one",
    "builds up the partition function @xcite-@xcite . in the context of statistical physics",
    "the model has been identified with directed polymers on the trees , and has been also related to the spin - glass model rem @xcite,@xcite .",
    "independently , similar models have been applied and extensively investigated also in the context of financial mathematics and turbulence @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "they are also intimately connected to 2-d conformal models @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the hierarchical structure of the tree naturally induces recursive relations for the partition function , with the branching number @xmath0 being a parameter in the recursion .",
    "while by construction the branching number q is an integer , one can formally consider the recursive equations @xcite,@xcite in the @xmath2 limit , simultaneously allowing @xmath3 and keeping the number of endpoints @xmath1 fixed .",
    "such an idea has been suggested in @xcite , later worked out in more detail in @xcite . along that line",
    "an exact renormalization equation for continuous tree models has been derived in @xcite for the general distribution of random variables .",
    "the hierarchic tree models belong to the type of random energy models ( rem s ) which all share the leading term in the free energy with that of the simplest derrida s model .",
    "the investigation of rem like models in finite dimensions has been started in @xcite and got serious impetus from recent solution of 1-d models with logarithmic correlation of energies at different sites @xcite .",
    "that solution essentially used the generalization of selberg integrals @xcite,@xcite to complex number of integrations ( see rigorous mathematical justification in @xcite ) .",
    "the 1d models are intimately connected with the model @xcite,@xcite .",
    "recently @xcite we have developed a statistical physics approach to related dynamical msm models @xcite . while all three types of rem models : hierarchical tree @xcite , 1-d logarithmic rem @xcite and msm @xcite have exactly the same mean free energy as the standard rem , they have different distributions for the free energy and the partition function .",
    "most essentially , in the derrida s rem the probability distribution of the partition function has no fat tails in the high temperature phase @xcite , while such tails are present in 1d models @xcite . in this work",
    "we give indication that such tails exists in the hierarchic model , and also reveal the multi - fractal properties of the later , which is important for applications @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for a recent discussion of multifractal properties of rem , and other models with logarithmic correlations see @xcite and references therein .    in multifractal approach",
    "@xcite,@xcite one considers the moments of a random variable ( partition function ) z at some scale @xmath4 defined with respect to the maximal scale l : @xmath5 where the exponent @xmath6 defines the multi - scaling .    knowing the @xmath6 and the coefficients @xmath7 in the limit of large @xmath8 , one can reconstruct the probability distribution of the partition function . in this way such",
    "a distribution has been explicitly derived for 1-d logarithmic rems @xcite    in the present article we will calculate @xmath6 for hierarchical tree , and derive recursive relations to define @xmath9 , which , in principle , could be applied to calculate the probability distribution of z within some accuracy .",
    "we shall see indications of the fact that the divergence of moments is essentially the same as for @xmath10 case , thus the two types of models must share the same fat tails .",
    "let us define the model outlined in the introduction following the papers @xcite,@xcite .",
    "starting with the hierarchical tree with integer branching number @xmath0 and @xmath1 endpoints , we consider two such end - points @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the two paths connecting these points to the root coincide up to a level m , counting from the root .",
    "accordingly , we can define the hierarchic distance between the two points as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 associated with every branch of the tree is a gaussian random variable @xmath16 distributed according to the law @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we define the energy @xmath18 at the endpoint @xmath11 as a sum of corresponding variables @xmath16 sampled along the unique path connecting the point @xmath11 to the of the tree .",
    "we further define the partition function @xmath19 where the sum is over @xmath20 end - points",
    ".    then we obtain @xmath21 in eq.([e6 ] ) the sum is over all endpoints of the tree separated by the hierarchic distance @xmath22 from a chosen point .",
    "now we consider the limit @xmath23 while keeping the value of @xmath14 fixed and large .",
    "recall that @xmath24 .",
    "in such a limit there are @xmath25 end points at the hierarchic distance @xmath26 .",
    "while calculating the @xmath27 , we may discard the contributions given by fig .",
    "we formally replace the sum over the tree with the integration over a measure @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 we are able to calculate @xmath27 for the integration range going over the maximal distance @xmath22 .",
    "= 0.1 in    ( 42,12 ) ( -1.7,-2 )    ( 16.5,-2 )    when calculating the correlations in eq.(8 ) we use the following trick : the part of the trajectory of @xmath11 with the hierarchic length @xmath26 which has no overlap with trajectories from other points yields a factor @xmath30 , while the part of the trajectory common to @xmath31 such trajectories and hierarchic length @xmath26 yields a factor @xmath32 .",
    "consider @xmath33 for simplicity , with summation going up to the maximal distance @xmath34 .",
    "we then have @xmath35 positions for the top level of hierarchy . then , summing ( or `` integrating '' ) over the number of two points at the distance @xmath36 we get @xmath37 where we have introduced the parameter @xmath38 .",
    "consider now the integration in eq.([e8 ] ) going up to the maximal hierarchic distance v. we assume the following ansatz : @xmath39 where we have introduced dimensionless coefficients @xmath9 .",
    "the results of our calculation support the ansatz in eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) , see eqs.([e13])-([e14 ] ) .",
    "actually the ansatz eq.([e10 ] ) is correct only when @xmath40 otherwise there is a phase transition to a different phase @xcite , which manifests itself via diverging integration in eq.([e8 ] ) .",
    "we will explicitly consider the case of positive @xmath41 ( imaginary @xmath42 ) while calculating some eventual expression ( there is no any restriction on @xmath31 like eq.(11 ) ) , like the analytical approximation of the fractional moment @xmath43 and then continue analytically the resulting expressions to the realistic case of negative @xmath44 .",
    "the analytical continuation gives wrong results in sg , when we continue the expressions for moments to the other statistical physics phase .",
    "hopefully in our case we are interested to continue to expressions of moments in the same phase .",
    "considering now the general case we calculate @xmath45 recursively . at the highest hierarchy level ,",

    "we assume the minimum hierarchy level where all the paths from the root to @xmath31 points meet is given by @xmath26 . there are @xmath35 such locations on the tree .",
    "integrating over the positions of all points with a given v we arrive to @xmath50e^{v - v+bvm(n - m)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the scaling ansatz eq.([e10 ] ) gives @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 thus , the problem amounts to solving the recursive equation ( [ e14 ] ) with the initial condition ( [ e12 ] ) .",
    "eq.([e10 ] ) defines the so - called multifractal scaling .",
    "we can rewrite it in the form @xmath54    let us now define a characteristic function @xmath55 for those values of @xmath42 where the sum converges .",
    "we rewrite eq.(14 ) as @xmath56 using the equations : @xmath57 we derive the following ode for the characteristic function : @xmath58 unfortunately we could not solve eq.(19 ) to derive explicitly analytical expressions for @xmath45 in case of general ( complex ) values of @xmath31 , which precludes from following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , eq.(19 ) allows us to extract a few first moments .",
    "we find : @xmath59    = 0.1 in    ( 42,12 ) ( 0,0 )    the above relation allows us also to calculate the asymptotic of @xmath9 at large @xmath31 . in doing this",
    "we assume that our function @xmath60 has a singularity at some @xmath61 of the form @xcite @xmath62 putting the latter expression into eq.([e19 ] ) , we derive : @xmath63 eq.([e22 ] ) gives the asymptotic expression @xmath64 we can define the value of @xmath65 only numerically , looking at @xmath45 for large values of the parameter @xmath31 .",
    "a similar problem has been considered in @xcite . slightly modifying their results we arrive at the following algorithm to calculate @xmath65 . for a given integer @xmath66 we are looking the minimum over @xmath67 and obtain : @xmath68^{1/(2+n ) } |_{0\\le j\\le n_0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is possible to get accurate values of @xmath69 by increasing the value of @xmath66 .    in @xcite,@xcite",
    "the following reaction - diffusion equation has been derived for the same model : @xmath70 where @xmath71 played the role of time parameter in the reaction - diffusion equation .",

    "eq.([e25 ] ) allows one to be investigated via the traveling wave approach @xcite and @xmath74 is its critical point .",
    "the critical point of eq.(19 ) should therefore correspond to @xmath75 , and is associated with the anticipated freezing transition from the high temperature phase to spin - glass - like phase .      instead of eq.(4 )",
    "we now consider @xmath76\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then for the the sum @xmath18 of k random variables x , we can compose the distribution @xmath77 simply by multiplying @xmath78 in the exponent of eq . (",

    "performing the integration over all @xmath71 , we arrive at @xmath92 let us derive recursive equations to calculate @xmath93 , defined as @xmath94 we need to consider all possible splitting @xmath95 , with @xmath96 .",
    "let as assume that two group with @xmath46 and @xmath97 endpoints of our hierarchic tree are separated by the hierarchic distance @xmath26 , and their trajectories meet at some point @xmath91 .",
    "the calculations similar to those used to derive eq.([e14 ] ) give : @xmath98 then the scaling in eq.([e32 ] ) yields : @xmath99 one can use eqs.([e31]),([e34 ] ) to calculate any positive integer moment of the partition function under the condition @xmath100 eq.([e32 ] ) implies the multifractal behavior with @xmath101    for the corresponding generating function we now obtain an equation @xmath102 for the same model in @xcite ,",
    "another equation has been derived : @xmath103 thus two equations must be related .      in",
    "@xcite the following partition function has been considered : @xmath104 with the parameter @xmath16 being an ultraviolet cutoff needed to regularize the model .",
    "the above model shares the multifractal properties with our model for normal distribution of random energies , with the mapping @xmath105 let us compare the moments .",
    "ref.@xcite gives the following expression for the moments : @xmath106 where @xmath107 .",
    "we have , naturally @xmath108 and further @xmath109 comparing with the results of the section ii - a , we see that second moment @xmath110 has different expansion for the small @xmath111 , @xmath112 more important information contained in moments is however the _ smallest _ real pole @xmath113 as a function of @xmath114 ( respectively , @xmath41 ) . indeed ,",
    "precisely those poles define the critical temperatures @xmath115 below which the given moment of the partition function start to diverge .",
    "it is easy to see from eq .",
    "( [ e41 ] ) that for one - dimensional model @xmath116 , @xmath117 while eq.([e42 ] ) gives the smallest pole poles at @xmath118 for @xmath119 , @xmath120 for @xmath121 , @xmath122 for @xmath123 , etc .",
    "the results for a few lower moments indicate that the two models share the same sequence of `` transition temperatures '' .",
    "though we are unable to prove this statement in full generality , the factor @xmath124 appearing in the denominator of the right - hand side of the recursion eq.([e14 ] ) makes the statement very plausible , if no special cancelations happen . assuming that correspondence is correct",
    ", the latter property would imply the probability density for the partition function in both models share the same power law tail : @xmath125 valid everywhere in the high - temperature phase @xmath126 .",
    "such a tail was indeed proposed as one of the universal features characterizing the class of models with logarithmic correlations @xcite .",
    "we obtained analytical expressions for the hierarchic model s @xmath45 at positive b , eq.(14 ) .",
    "having large series of @xmath45 for positive @xmath41 , one can try to construct an approximate expression for the probability distribution and fractional moments .",
    "the investigation of the statistical mechanics of rem - like models in finite dimension and their multifractal properties remains an active field of research , especially after the advances achieved in @xcite and @xcite . in this article",
    "we confirmed that the multifractal properties are shared by the third class of rem - like models : directed polymers on a hierarchic tree .",
    "we calculated the corresponding moments important for the applications .",
    "in particular , we use those moments to conjecture the power law tail of the distribution of partition function @xmath127 in the high - temperature phase .",
    "unfortunately it is impossible to derive exact probability distribution , as has been done in @xcite for the 1-d logarithmic rem .",
    "nevertheless , our formulas allow the calculation of infinite series of the moments for some values of parameters .",
    "we hope that such information could be applied to recover the probability distribution , a well known problem in probability theory @xcite .",
    "our results are interesting for the mathematics of reaction - diffusion equations as well , as we related them to a certain nonlinear ode .",
    "moreover , we found the connection between the multifractal spectrum and the hierarchic tree model eq.([e36 ] ) , while the latter has been mapped to some reaction - diffusion equations @xcite , see eq.([e38 ] ) in the present article .",
    "thus the reaction -diffusion equations have some multiscaling structures .",
    "one can connect reaction diffusion equation and nonlinear ode with the interesting versions of multi - fractal phenomenon , i.e. @xcite , and try to investigate them for deriving the multifractal scaling from the reaction diffusion equation ( [ e38 ] ) .",
    "such a work is currently in the progress .",
    "the directed walk models on hierarchic tree describes a rather rich physics , as well as some connections with quantum models in finite dimension .",
    "the relation to 2-d conformal field models is rather well known @xcite,@xcite , and the work @xcite mentions the relations to quantum disorder problem in finite dimensions @xcite .",
    "it will be interesting to try to apply the methods of the current work or our renormalization group ( [ e38 ] ) to the finite dimensional quantum disorder problem .",
