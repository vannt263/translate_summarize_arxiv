    "the lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath1cdm ) model has recently shown an enormous predictive power .",
    "it can explain the structure formation of the universe , its accelerated expansion , the micro kelvin fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background radiation , etc .",
    "nevertheless , some issues around this model related to the formation of galaxies have arisen since the time it was originally proposed and remain to date .",
    "the cdm paradigm predicts a density profile which corresponds to the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile , navarro et al , 1997 , given by @xmath2    however , this profile seems to have some differences to the observed profiles of lsb galaxies . in this work",
    "we show that a flat central profile naturally arises within the scalar field dark matter hypothesis , implying that the central region of galaxies can distinguish between cdm and sfdm .",
    "we work within the specific context of the so  called ` strong , self  interacting scalar field dark matter ' ( sfdm ) hypothesis that has been developed by several authors , guzmn and matos 2000 , matos and urea - lpez 2000 , 2001 ; urea - lpez , matos and becerril 2002 ; matos and guzmn 2001 ; alcubierre et al .",
    "2002 , 2003 ; urea - lpez 2002 ; bhmer and harko 2007 ; ( see also peebles 2000 ) .    a first proposal of the sfdm hypothesis appeared in a couple of papers by ji and sin 1994 .",
    "they took a massive scalar field and were able to fit observations comming from some galaxies , taken into account also the contribution of baryons . a key point in this work was the use of the so - called excited configurations in which the radial profile of the scalar fields has nodes . from that",
    ", they determined that the mass of the scalar field should be of order of @xmath3 ev .",
    "a next proposal appeared in a paper by schunck 1998 .",
    "he shows that a massless complex scalar field can be used as a dark matter model in galaxies to fit the rotation curves . in this model",
    "the internal frequency of the field plays the role of an adjustable parameter , and the radial profile of the scalar field also has nodes",
    ".    however , as pointed out in guzmn and urea - lpez 2005 ( see also guzmn and urea - lpez 2004 ) , this last proposal can not be realistic because a massless scalar field ( whether real or complex as in schunck 1998 ) can not form a gravitationally bound configuration ( see seidel and suen 1994 ) .",
    "the key idea of the sfdm scenario is that the dark matter responsible for structure formation in the universe is a real scalar field , @xmath4 , minimally coupled to einstein gravity with self - interaction parametrized by a potential energy of the form ( see also sahni and wang 2000 ) @xmath5 , \\label{coshpot}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the only two free parameters of the model , @xmath8 and we employ natural units @xmath9 .",
    "the effective mass of the scalar field is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the advantage of the sfdm model is that it is insensitive to initial conditions and the scalar field behaves as cdm once it begins to oscillate around the minimum of its potential . in this case , it can be shown ( see matos and urea - lpez 2000 , 2001 ) that the sfdm model is able to reproduce all the successes of the standard @xmath1cdm model above galactic scales .",
    "furthermore , it predicts a sharp cut - off in the mass power spectrum due to its quadratic nature , thus explaining the observed dearth of dwarf galaxies , in contrast with the possible excess predicted by high resolution n - body simulations with standard cdm , see matos and urea - lpez 2001 .",
    "fit model to the cosmological data can be deduced from the current densities of dark matter and radiation in the universe and from the cut  off in the mass power spectrum that constrains the number of dwarf galaxies in clusters .",
    "the favored values for the two free parameters of the scalar field potential are found to be , matos and urea - lpez 2001 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 g is the planck mass .",
    "this implies that the effective mass of the scalar field should be @xmath13 ev .",
    "let us explain why we suspect that the scalar field could be the dark matter at galactic scales as well .",
    "there are three main reasons .",
    "the first reason is that numerical simulations suggest that the critical mass for the case considered here , using the scalar potential ( [ coshpot ] ) , and the parameters given by eq .",
    "( [ v0 ] ) , is approximately , alcubierre et .",
    "2002 @xmath14    this was a surprising result .",
    "the critical mass of the model shown in matos and urea - lpez 2000 , 2001 , is of the same order of magnitude of the dark matter content of a standard galactic halo .",
    "observe that the parameters of the model , eq .  ( [ v0 ] ) , were fixed using cosmological observations .",
    "the surprising result consisted in the fact that using the same scalar field for explaining the dark matter at cosmological scales , it will always collapse with a preferred mass which corresponds to the halo of a real galaxy .",
    "thus , this result is a prediction of the cosmological sfdm model for galaxy formation .",
    "the second reason is that during the linear regime of cosmological fluctuations , the scalar field and a dust fluid , like cdm , behave in the same way .",
    "the density contrast in cdm and in the sfdm models evolve in exactly the same form and then both models predict the same large scale structure formation in the universe ( see matos and urea - lpez 2001 ) .",
    "the differences between the cdm and sfdm models begin to appear in the non linear regime of structure formation , so that there will be differences in their predictions on galaxy formation .",
    "the third reason is the topic of this work .",
    "a scalar field object ( e.g. an oscillaton ) contains a flat central density profile , as seems to be the case in galaxies .    in the case of the sfdm , the strong self - interaction of the scalar field results in the formation of solitonic objects called ` oscillatons ' , which have a mass of the order of a galaxy ( see for example urea - lpez 2002 , urea - lpez et al 2002 and alcubierre et al 2003 . also seidel and suen 1991 , 1994 , hawley and choptuik 2000 , and honda and choptuik 2001 ) . in this work",
    "we will show that these models contain an almost flat central density profile , @xmath15 , they do not exhibit the cusp density profiles characteristic of the standard cdm hypothesis .    before starting with the description ,",
    "we want to emphazise the fact that the scalar field has no interaction with the rest of the matter , thus , it does not follow the standard lines of reasoning for the particle - like candidates for dark matter .",
    "the scalar field was not thermalized , that is , the scalar field forms a bose condensate , and thus behaves strictly as cold dark matter from the beginning .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we use the fact that galaxies have a weak gravitational field and thus their space - time is almost flat .",
    "the main goal of this section is to study the physics provoking the flatness behavior of the density profiles at the center of the oscillatons .",
    "some results of this section intersect with those presented by jin and sin 1994 , where they studied the behavior of the weak field limit of a complex scalar field .",
    "we remark that we do our analysis for a real scalar field and some differences do arise due to a different current conservation . in section [",
    "sect : wf ] we present our contribution making an analysis of the einstein - klein - gordon ( ekg ) equations in the relativistic weak field limit and solve them for the perturbed metric coefficients .",
    "then , we compare these solutions with the ones obtained by solving numerically the complete ekg system and using the whole potential ( [ coshpot ] ) , we show that the relativistic weak field limit is indeed a very good approximation . in section [",
    "sect : sf ] we compute the energy density of the scalar field obtained in section [ sect : wf ] , and compare it with actual observations of lsb galaxies from which the density is inferred from the rotational curves , showing a good matching in the external regions and a match at least similar in some of the internal regions , in any case , better than a fit with a cusp - like behavior of the density .",
    "finally in section [ sect : conc ] we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we derive the physics of the scalar field in an analogous way as it was done for the complex scalar field by jin and sin 1994 ( see also lee and koh 1996 ) . in a normal dust collapse , as for example in cdm ,",
    "there is in principle nothing to avoid that the dust matter collapses all the time .",
    "there is only a radial gravitational force that provokes the collapse , and to stop it , one needs to invoke some virialization phenomenon . in the scalar field paradigm",
    "the collapse is different .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field is @xmath16 \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : set}\\ ] ] we will consider spherical symmetry , and work with the line element @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , being this last function the newtonian potential .",
    "the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field has then the components @xmath20   \\label{tensor1 } \\\\ & & t_{01 } = { \\cal p}_{\\phi } = \\dot{\\phi}\\phi^{\\prime }   \\label{tensor2 } \\\\ & & { t^{1}}_{1 } = p_{r}=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ e^{-2\\nu } { \\dot{\\phi}}^{2}+ e^{-2\\mu}\\phi ^{\\prime 2}-2v(\\phi ) \\right ]   \\label{tensor3 } \\\\ & & { t^{2}}_{2 } = p_{\\bot } = \\frac{1}{2 } \\left [ e^{-2\\nu } { \\dot{\\phi}}^{2}- e^{-2\\mu } \\phi ^{\\prime 2}- 2v(\\phi ) \\right ] \\label{tensor4}\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and also @xmath21 .",
    "these different components are identified as the energy density @xmath22 , the momentum density @xmath23 , the radial pressure @xmath24 and the angular pressure @xmath25 .",
    "the integrated mass is defined by @xmath26    the radial and angular pressures are two natural components of the scalar field which stop the collapse , avoiding the cusp density profiles in the centers of the collapsed objects .",
    "this is the main difference between the normal dust collapse and the sfdm one .",
    "the pressures play an important roll in the sfdm equilibrium . in order to see this , and considering that galaxies are almost flat , we conclude that the newtonian approximation should be sufficient to describe the processes . in this section",
    "we will take the flat space - time approximation .",
    "thus , we study a massive oscillaton without self - interaction ( @xmath27 with potential @xmath28 ) , in the minkowski background ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "even though it is not a solution to the einstein equations as we are neglecting the gravitational force provoked by the scalar field , the solution is analytic and it helps us to understand some features that appear in the non - flat oscillatons .    in a spherically symmetric space - time , the klein - gordon equation @xmath30 , ( where @xmath31 stands for the dalambertian ) , reads @xmath32 where over - dot denotes @xmath33 and prime denotes @xmath34 . the exact general solution for the scalar field @xmath35 is @xmath36 and we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath37 . for @xmath38",

    ", the flat oscillaton density profile behaves like the isothermal one .",
    "the mass function oscillates around @xmath48 , as usual for the galactic halos .    in order to understand what is happening within the object ,",
    "observe that the kg equation can be rewritten in a more convenient form in terms of the energy density , as @xmath49    this last equation has a clear interpretation : since its form looks like the conservation equation , @xmath50 , equation ( [ kgflat ] ) represents the conservation of the scalar field energy .",
    "it also tells us that there is a scalar field current given by @xmath51 \\frac{\\sin(x)\\sin(2\\omega t)}{x^{3}}\\vec{r}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    observe that the quantity involved in this current is the scalar field momentum density ( [ tensor2 ] ) .",
    "although the flux of scalar radiation at large distances does not vanish , there is not a net flux of energy , as it can be seen by averaging the scalar current on a period of a scalar oscillation .",
    "we also see that the only transformation process is that of the scalar field energy density into the momentum density , and viceversa . for the realistic values ( [ v0 ] ) this transfer is very small .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : compar ] we show the comparison between the nfw , the isothermal and the sfdm density profiles for the same galaxy .",
