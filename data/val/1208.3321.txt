    "these mean that the sample covariance @xmath5 is no longer consistent to @xmath0 , which hinders applications of many conventional multivariate statistical procedures for high - dimensional data .    to overcome the problem with the sample covariance , constructing covariance estimators via banding or tapering",
    "the sample covariance matrix has been a focus in high - dimensional covariance estimation . @xcite",
    "considered banding the cholesky factor matrix via the kernel smoothing estimation , which was further developed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed banding the sample covariance matrix directly for estimating @xmath0 and banding the cholesky factor matrix for estimating @xmath7 .",
    "they demonstrated that both estimators are consistent to  @xmath0 and @xmath7 , respectively , for some `` bandable '' classes of covariance matrices .",
    "@xcite proposed a tapering estimator , which can be viewed as a soft banding on the sample covariance , which was designed to improve the banding estimator of bickel and levina .",
    "they demonstrated that the tapering estimator attains the optimal minimax rates of convergence for estimating the covariance matrix .",
    "wagaman and levina ( @xcite ) developed a method for discovering meaningful orderings of variables such that banding and tapering can be applied .",
    "both the banding and tapering methods for covariance estimation are well connected to the regularization method considered in huang et al .",

    "there is yet a practical guideline to confirm or otherwise if a @xmath8 is within the `` bandable '' class so that the banding and tapering can be applied .",

    "the importance commanded by covariance matrices in high - dimensional multivariate analysis , directly testing for @xmath0 being diagonal and the so - called sphericity hypothesis in classical multivariate analysis [ @xcite and @xcite ] , have been considered in a set of studies including @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and cai and jiang ( @xcite ) under high dimensionality . for normally distributed data , @xcite proposed testing for diagonal @xmath8 by considering a coherence statistic @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sample correlation coefficient between the @xmath11th and the @xmath12th components of the random vector @xmath4 .",
    "jiang established the asymptotic distribution of @xmath13 under the null diagonal hypothesis , which was used to derive a sphericity test .",

    ", we propose a nonparametric test for @xmath0 being banded without assuming a parametric distribution for the high - dimensional data .",
