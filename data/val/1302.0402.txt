    "the assumption that the relaxation modulus of a viscoelastic medium is a completely monotonic function has many implications for dispersion , attenuation and the kramers - kronig ( k - k ) dispersion relations .",

    "molecular relaxation can be investigated by studying dielectric loss .",
    "dielectric loss in polar dielectrics exhibits similar features ( alpha and beta peaks ) to the mechanical loss modulus while the dielectric permittivity , representing gradual polarization of the material in an electric field , has all the properties of mechanical creep @xcite .    in seismological applications",
    "the minimum - phase aspect of viscoelastic wave propagation is relevant for deconvolution .",
    "the assumption that the relaxation modulus is a completely monotonic function has its roots in the interpolation of experimental data in terms of prony sums with positive coefficients @xcite . by bernstein",
    "s theorem complete monotonicity of the relaxation modulus is equivalent to the statement that the relaxation spectral measure is non - negative .",
    "a prony sum with positive coefficients is a completely monotonic function with a spectral measure supported by a finite set of points .",
    "several attempts have been made to justify complete monotonicity of the relaxation modulus by an assumption about dependence of stress on loops in the past history @xcite , by an assumed relation between time dependence of strain and stress @xcite or by other arguments @xcite .",
    "the theory of viscoelasticity based on the assumption of complete monotonicity of the relaxation modulus is very attractive because it leads to a fairly complete characterization of the creep compliance , complex modulus , attenuation and dispersion as well as the possible anisotropic properties of the medium @xcite . a weak point of the theory is an instability of the property of complete monotonicity : in an arbitrary neighborhood of a completely monotonic function in the space of bounded continuous functions there are functions which are not completely monotonic .",
    "the assumption of complete monotonicity has therefore to be considered as an a priori restriction on the data and on the interpolating functions .",
    "parameter estimation based on experimental data has to be performed in the class of completely monotonic functions .",
    "this is however implicit in routine modeling of experimental data for stress relaxation in terms of prony sums for general viscoelastic media @xcite or in terms of cole - cole @xcite , havriliak - negami @xcite and kohlrausch - williams - watts @xcite relaxation moduli for more specific classes of viscoelastic materials .",

    "it is shown below that the complex wave number function , the attenuation function and the dispersion function of a medium with a completely monotonic relaxation modulus are parameterized by the dispersion - attenuation spectral measure ( sec .",

    "the dispersion function and the attenuation function satisfy a dispersion relation in parametric form because both functions are expressed in terms of a single spectral measure .",
    "this dispersion relation implies the k - k dispersion relations with two subtractions ( sec .",
    "[ sec : kk ] ) .",
    "the k - k dispersion relations indicate that the complex wave number function is the laplace transform of a causal distribution .",
    "this distribution turns out to be a second - order distributional derivative of a causal function defined in terms of the laplace transform of the dispersion - attenuation spectral measure .",
    "the k - k dispersion relations are closely related to the minimum phase property of viscoelastic green s functions ( sec .",

    "this property is relevant for deconvolution of seismic signals .",
    "the dispersion - attenuation spectral measure can often be explicitly calculated for a given analytic complex modulus by analytic continuation to the entire complex plane cut along the negative real semi - axis and calculating the jump of the analytic continuation at the branch cut . this procedure is demonstrated for the cole - cole , havriliak - negami and cole - davidson relaxation models ( sec .",
