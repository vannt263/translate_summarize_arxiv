    "investigation of current fluctuations is a valuable tool for characterization of the underlying transport mechanism . at low temperatures the main contribution to low - frequency fluctuations comes from the shot noise associated with charge quantization  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the shot noise depends on the quasiparticle charge and the correlation of transport events , which is associated with quasiparticle statistics or the presence of interactions  @xcite . in quantum dots",
    "the noise was found to provide information about the asymmetry  @xcite and spin - dependence  @xcite of tunneling rates in coulomb blockade systems , interactions with the external environment ( with charge  @xcite , spin  @xcite and vibrational  @xcite degrees of freedom ) , the presence of quantum coherence  @xcite or many - body quantum correlations ( e.g. in the kondo effect  @xcite ) , or the existence of majorana fermions  @xcite .",
    "there are three characteristic regimes of noise distinguished by the value of the fano factor @xmath0 , which is a ratio of the noise power and the mean current ( see e.g. refs .",
    "if transport events are uncorrelated the noise is poissonian ( @xmath1 ) . in fermionic systems ,",
    "correlations typically reduce the noise to sub - poissonian values ( @xmath2 ) . however , there are also cases for which the noise may become super - poissonian ( @xmath3 )",
    ".    one of the mechanisms generating the super - poissonian noise is the dynamical channel blockade  @xcite , which is associated with the coexistence of transport channels with different conductances .",
    "the electron occupying one channel may block transport through the remaining channels , which would lead to the noise enhancement .",
    "this mechanism has been reported in experimental studies of the electronic transport through multilevel quantum dots  @xcite and organic metallic tunnel junctions  @xcite .",
    "another mechanism of noise enhancement , which should be carefully distinguished from the former , is the stochastic switching between transport channels with different conductances , referred to as the telegraphic switching  @xcite .",
    "it can be caused either by some external factor ( e.g. a charge  @xcite or spin  @xcite dynamics of a coupled external system ) or by some intrinsic causes ( i.e. it can be a result of switching between charge  @xcite , spin  @xcite , vibrational  @xcite , motional  @xcite or energy  @xcite states of a system itself ) . while this phenomenon has been studied mostly theoretically , the noise enhancement resulting from the switching between the ground and the metastable excited state of a quantum dot  @xcite or from the dependence of tunneling rates on a vibrational state of a single - molecule transistor  @xcite has been experimentally observed using charge counting techniques and conventional current measurements , respectively .",
    "a more general analysis of the current fluctuations can be provided by two other already established approaches : the full counting statistics ( fcs )  @xcite and the waiting time distribution ( wtd )  @xcite .",
    "fcs analyses the distribution of the number of particles transferred in a given time interval , providing information not only about the noise , but also about higher zero - frequency current correlators .",
    "high - order cumulants were found to be useful for reconstructing generators of the time evolution of systems with multiple degrees of freedom  @xcite . in a complementary way , wtd studies the distribution of time delays between subsequent physical events .",
    "wtd was found to reveal the short - time dynamics of the system , for example by showing the oscillatory behavior of the distribution associated with a spin precession  @xcite or coherent oscillations of electrons in a system ( e.g. in a quantum dot molecule  @xcite or a quantum dot attached to normal and superconducting leads  @xcite ) . in quantum dots both fcs and wtd",
    "can be experimentally studied using charge detection techniques  @xcite .",
    "while such experiments are mostly conducted in ultra - low temperatures ( down to several millikelvins ) , recently the real - time charge trap dynamics monitoring at room temperature has been shown to be feasible  @xcite .",
    "however , single electron counting experiments are currently confined to very low currents , with frequencies of tunneling events on the order of khz  @xcite . due to this fact , the method determining indirectly wtd with the easier measurable quantities , like the second - order current correlation function , has been proposed  @xcite . while this paper focuses on electronic transport ,",
    "both fcs and wtd are widely applied also beyond this field , for example in quantum optics  @xcite and statistical kinetics of biomolecular systems  @xcite .    in many cases",
    "transport statistics can be well described by the renewal theory , which assumes that successive waiting times between transport events are statistically independent equally distributed random variables  @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the joint probability density of two successive waiting times @xmath4 can be factorized into a product of two single - time distributions @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "when this assumption is satisfied , there are exact identities between cumulants of fcs and wtd , enabling the reconstruction of fcs on the basis of wtd  @xcite . moreover , for the renewal dynamics a relation holds between wtd and the second - order correlation function @xmath6 , which enables the reconstruction of the former on the basis of the latter , even when the detector efficiency is below 100%  @xcite .",
    "however , studies of coherent transport in a quantum point contact have shown that waiting times between successive transport events can be correlated  @xcite .",
    "correlations were found to appear due to the fermionic statistics of electrons .",
    "the presence of correlations indicates that the renewal assumption is not satisfied .",
    "in such a case , the aforementioned relations between cumulants of fcs and wtd are no longer valid , as shown by albert  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . beyond the field of electronic transport",
    ", nonrenewal statistics have been previously investigated in some systems described by the markovian master equation , for example in optical  @xcite or biochemical  @xcite ones .",
    "in particular , the analysis of waiting times correlations was shown to give an insight into the internal dynamics of fluorescent molecules  @xcite .",
    "this suggests , that the investigation of physical quantities characterizing the deviation from the renewal behavior may be a useful tool for characterization of the experimentally relevant systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the investigation of nonrenewal statistics to electronic transport in the sequential tunneling regime . to this end ,",
    "i analyze two conceptually simple and experimentally feasible transport models : the system of two capacitively interacting quantum dots and the single - impurity anderson model in the infinite - bias limit realized in a quantum dot attached to spin polarized leads .",
    "these models enable a relatively simple qualitative understanding of physical mechanisms generating nonrenewal current fluctuations , and thus may provide a working basis for the analysis of more complex mesoscopic systems .",
    "transport statistics of the studied models are analyzed using the methods based on the master equation  @xcite .",
    "the nonrenewal behavior is made evident by calculating the joint distribution and the cross - correlation of two subsequent waiting times .",
    "these quantities are shown to give an insight into the internal dynamics of the system , for example by providing a way to distinguish between the telegraphic switching and the dynamical channel blockade .",
    "the influence of the nonrenewal dynamics on fcs and wtd is also analyzed .",
    "this reveals some nontrivial effects , like the nonequivalence of waiting time distributions for incoming and outgoing electrons which arises due to the correlation between electron jumps .",
    "moreover , in order to extend the analysis to the systems for which the single - electron counting is not experimentally feasible , i study the influence of the nonrenewal dynamics on the second - order current correlation function and its relation to fcs and wtd .",

    "@xcite , in such a case the tunneling is unidirectional and can be exactly described by the markovian master equation .",

    "the study is also confined to the systems having a unique stationary state @xmath11 , which is a solution of the equation @xmath12 .    to characterize the current fluctuations in the stationary state",

    "i focus on time - independent scaled cumulants of fcs .",
    "the @xmath17-th order scaled cumulant @xmath18 is defined in the following way : @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath17-th order cumulant of the number of jump events occurring in the time @xmath21 .",

    "it is impossible to find analytical expressions for @xmath23 if the rank of the matrix is higher than 4 .",

    "the knowledge of @xmath23 is not required since @xmath27 .",
    "now , the waiting time distribution is considered following the approach developed by t. brandes  @xcite .",
    "one can calculate the distribution of waiting times either between two successive jump events of the same type @xmath28 or between jumps of two different types @xmath28 and @xmath29 . in this paper",
    "the term `` jump of type @xmath28 '' refers to the tunneling between a dot and a chosen lead ; in general it may refer to an arbitrarily chosen set of transitions within the markovian model .",

    "if subsequent waiting times are uncorrelated the joint wtd can be factorized in the following way : @xmath50 and @xmath51 , otherwise it is not possible .",
    "such a factorization is often referred to as the renewal property  @xcite . using the joint wtd",

    "if the jumps associated with the operator @xmath35 are renewal processes , one can find a direct relation between wtd and the cumulant generating function of fcs  @xcite , as well as between the cumulants of fcs and wtd  @xcite . for nonrenewal processes such simple relations do not hold  @xcite . in markovian systems ,",
    "like the ones considered in this paper , all elementary processes ( i.e the transitions between single states in the liouville space ) are renewal ones and one can always find a relation between the full counting statistics and the waiting time distributions of such processes  @xcite .",

    "in this section i consider the system of two capacitively coupled quantum dots [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dqd ]  ( a ) ] to illustrate the generation of nonrenewal current fluctuations due to the telegraphic switching .",
    "such a double quantum dot system , despite its simplicity , exhibits a rich physics , and therefore has been already extensively studied both experimentally  @xcite and theoretically  @xcite .",
    "previous studies have revealed , for example , phenomena like a coulomb drag  @xcite , heat - to - current conversion  @xcite and even maxwells - demon - like behavior  @xcite ( confirmed experimentally by using the system of two metallic islands  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , recently the influence of the telegraphic switching on the full counting statistics in a similar system of two capacitively coupled single electron boxes has been experimentally investigated  @xcite .",
    "the studied system is a four terminal one  each dot is coupled to separate left ( source ) and right ( drain ) leads . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , the infinite - bias limit is taken .",
    "tunneling rates between the dot and the leads are assumed to be energy - dependent , which is experimentally feasible  @xcite , and thus their values are conditioned on the occupancy of the other dot .",
    "additionally , a strong intra - dot coulomb repulsion is assumed  each dot can be occupied by at most one electron .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of the system can be described by a four - state markovian model with states defined in the basis @xmath74 , where the first and the second position in the brackets corresponds to the upper and the lower dot , while @xmath75 and @xmath76 refers to the empty and the occupied dot , respectively [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dqd ]  ( b ) ] .",
    "the liouvillian written in the considered basis reads @xmath77    in principle , by using two separate detectors , it is possible to simultaneously detect charge states of both dots . in this way one can observe the whole dynamics of the system . since the dynamics is markovian , each transition between individual charge states is a renewal process .",
    "however , in this paper i focus on the statistics of tunneling events in the upper quantum dot only , treating the lower dot as an external source of a random telegraph noise ( similarly to refs .",
    "the main reason for this is to provide a simple model which well illustrates the influence of telegraphic switching on current fluctuations ( and , in particular , on waiting time correlations ) .",
    "already in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been reported , that the telegraphic switching may generate a correlation between subsequent waiting times . moreover , nonrenewal photon statistics in a similar four - state model have been already studied in refs .",
    "however , this paper extends these previous studies in two ways .",
    "firstly , it analyses additional statistical quantities , like the second and the third cumulant of current fluctuations .",
    "secondly , it presents qualitatively new phenomena resulting from the reduction of symmetry of the model studied .    to explain , why the random switching is expected to occur in the system , the liouvillian is decomposed as follows : @xmath78 where @xmath79/@xmath80 are operators describing tunneling in the upper / lower dot ( containing , respectively , tunneling rates @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) . the operator @xmath79 can be written in the block - diagonal form @xmath83 where matrices @xmath84 and @xmath85 contain transitions rates @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "these matrices describe tunneling in two distinct transport channels corresponding to different charge configurations of the lower dot .",
    "the operator @xmath80 , meanwhile , describes the switching between these channels .",
    "thus , the system is expected to exhibit the telegraphic switching behavior .    in order to calculate the statistics of current fluctuations ,",
    "i also define two jump operators @xmath88 describing the tunneling from the left lead to the upper dot and the tunneling from the upper dot to the right lead , respectively .",
    "as one can note , each of these operators corresponds to two transitions within the four state model . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] , the waiting time correlations can occur only , when the jump operator corresponds to at least two elementary transitions .",
    "i begin my analysis with the simplest case illustrating the telegraphic switching : the system with dots symmetrically coupled to left and rights leads [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dqdstates ]  ( a ) ] . the tunneling rates in the lower channel",
    "are assumed to be energy independent and equal to @xmath89 .",
    "the tunneling rates between the upper dot and the leads are equal to @xmath90 when the lower dot is empty and @xmath91 when the lower dot is occupied , where @xmath92 is the asymmetry parameter describing the energy dependence of tunneling rates .",
    "+    at first , i show that waiting time correlations occur in the system .",
    "i denote the waiting time between subsequent electron jumps from the left lead to the upper dot as @xmath93 .",
    "[ fig : resdqd1 ]  ( a ) shows the dependence of the normalized cross - correlation of two subsequent times @xmath93 on the asymmetry parameter @xmath92 for different ratios @xmath94",
    ". one can observe that for @xmath95 the cross - correlation can be positive , which clearly indicates that the dynamics is nonrenewal . as a matter of fact",
    ", the joint distribution of two subsequent waiting times can not be factorized into a product of two single - waiting time distributions .",
    "the presence of the correlation results from the telegraphic switching between transport channels with different values of tunneling rates [ either @xmath91 or @xmath90 ] . when the channel with higher tunneling rates ( later referred to as the fast channel ) is open , the subsequent waiting times tends to be shorter than the mean value .",
    "accordingly , when the second ( slow ) channel is open , the subsequent waiting times tends to be longer than the mean value . as a result ,",
    "the subsequent waiting times become positively correlated .",
    "the cross - correlation is reduced as the ratio @xmath94 rises , because the fast switching between channels increases the probability that a short waiting time is followed by a long one and conversely . in the limiting case of @xmath97 ,",
    "the correlation vanishes .",
    "when the absolute value of @xmath92 is increased , the cross - correlation at first rises because the deviation of waiting times from the mean value increases in either channel . however , for high values of @xmath98 the ncc starts to decrease ( expect for the limiting case of @xmath99 ) .",
    "in such a case the current flowing through a slow channel is blocked , and transport is predominated by the tunneling in the fast channel , which decreases the number of waiting times deviating from the mean value , and consequently also the value of cross - correlation .    in the next step",
    "i analyze the influence of telegraphic switching on the full counting statistics and the waiting time distribution , and show that their joint analysis also provides information about the nonrenewal behavior of the system .",
    "it has been already reported by albert  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who studied fcs and wtd in a quantum point contact .",
    "however , the system analyzed herein enables to study the qualitative behavior of fcs and wtd in a simpler way , and reveals also the specific physics of telegraphic switching phenomenon .",
    "i focus on the analysis of two quantities associated with the fcs and wtd respectively , the fano factor @xmath0 and the randomness parameter @xmath100  @xcite : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the number of particles tunneling through the upper dot within the time @xmath21 . if the renewal assumption is satisfied , these parameters are the same  @xcite . as fig .  [",
    "fig : resdqd1 ]  ( b ) clearly shows , here this equality does not hold . in the considered system",
    "the fano factor is always higher than or equal to the randomness parameter .",
    "the difference @xmath103 depends on @xmath94 and @xmath92 in a similar way as the cross - correlation @xmath104 . when the magnitude of the asymmetry parameter @xmath98 is sufficiently high , and at the same time the ratio @xmath94 is low enough , the noise becomes super - poissonian .",
    "such a large noise enhancement resulting from the telegraphic switching is an already known phenomenon  @xcite . in the limiting case of @xmath99 ,",
    "the fano factor becomes infinite for arbitrary non - zero values of @xmath92 .",
    "the randomness parameter , however , remains finite also at this limit .",
    "let s now explain this .",
    "for @xmath99 the switching between transport channels becomes infinitesimally slow , and thus one can assume that during an arbitrarily long time interval either the fast or the slow channel is open .",
    "therefore , one can consider two separate distributions of charge transmitted in the fast and the slow channel , denoted as @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "the variance of the number of transmitted particles is given by the following expression : @xmath107 ^ 2 \\rangle+p_s \\langle [ n_s(t )",

    "the variance is predominated by the sum of terms @xmath110 ^ 2 = ( i_j - i)^2 t^2 $ ] , where @xmath111 , @xmath112 is the mean current and @xmath113 is the mean current in the @xmath114-th channel .",
    "these terms are quadratic functions of time , while the mean value @xmath115 is a linear function of @xmath21 , and thus @xmath116 .",
    "the randomness parameter , however , remains finite , which can be shown in a similar way .",
    "one can write the variance of waiting times as @xmath117 \\\\ \\nonumber   & + & p_s [ \\langle ( \\tau_s - \\langle \\tau_s \\rangle)^2 \\rangle+ ( \\langle \\tau_s \\rangle-\\langle \\tau \\rangle)^2 ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath118 are the waiting times measured in the fast / slow channel , while @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the probabilities that the charge is transmitted in the fast or the slow channel , respectively .",
    "it is a sum of finite quantities , and thus the randomness parameter remains finite .    as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , single electron counting experiments are currently confined to measurements of low currents corresponding to tunneling frequencies on the order of khz .",
    "moreover , they are not directly applicable for the study of electron transport beyond the sequential tunneling regime",
    ". however , it appears that the nonrenewal character of current fluctuations can be inferred using low - order current correlation functions , which in principle can be investigated by conventional current measurements . to show this ,",
    "let s consider cumulants @xmath72 of the pseudo - waiting time distribution @xmath71 calculated on the basis of the second - order current correlation function @xmath56 ( see the end of sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] ) .",
    "the pseudo - randomness parameter @xmath121 appears to be equal to the fano factor .",
    "however , it appears that the nonrenewal dynamics may be revealed by the behavior of higher order cumulants .",
    "let s analyze the following quantities : @xmath122     for the symmetric system [ fig .",

    "where for simplicity @xmath127 .",
    "these three quantities are equal to each other for renewal systems  @xcite , but in general they are unequal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sksym ] ) .",
    "thus , it may be concluded that the joint measurement of the third cumulant of the zero - frequency fcs , which is experimentally accessible using continuous current measurements  @xcite , and the second - order current correlation function @xmath56 enables to infer the presence of waiting time correlations .",
    "there is also a negative consequence : the identity  , which enables the reconstruction of wtd on the basis of @xmath56 or @xmath6 , does not hold any longer .",

    "[ sec : twodots ] , where only the positive cross - correlation occurred .",
    "this indicates that in the currently considered system there exist at least two competing processes leading to the negative and the positive cross - correlation , respectively .",
    "let s first analyze the process leading to the negative cross - correlation , which is clearly different from the one considered previously . as the definition of the cross - correlation [ eq",

    "le s now focus on the case of @xmath177 . as follows from fig .",
    "[ fig : nccand ] , the cross - correlation is then always negative . in this case",
    "the dynamics can be described by the three - state model [ fig .",
    "[ fig : anderson ]  ( b ) ] , later referred to as the cascade model .",

    "these events may occur even simultaneously [ @xmath181 is finite ] . however , if such a trajectory is realized , the next tunneling to the dot is blocked until at least one electron departs the dot , and therefore the waiting time tends to be longer than the mean one . in consequence , a short waiting time tends to be followed by a long one , which results in the negative cross - correlation .",
    "this can be illustrated by considering the difference @xmath182 , where @xmath4 is the joint distribution of two subsequent times @xmath93 ( denoted as @xmath183 and @xmath184 ) , and @xmath5 is the product of two single waiting times distributions . for the sake of better clarity of presentation",

    "the cross - correlation of the subsequent waiting times is negative , because short and long waiting times are intermingled . since the system is deterministic , in the long time limit the number of particles transferred in the time @xmath21 is not fluctuating and is given by the expression @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the mean waiting time @xmath194 .",
    "thus , the fano factor is equal to 0 .",

    "the analysis has shown that the relation considered is not universal , but rather applies only to specific systems .",

    "the mutual information is always positive when the dynamics is nonrenewal and equals 0 in the opposite case . as a result",
    ", the mutual information informs about the degree of deviation from the renewal behavior , but not about the character of correlations .",
    "thus , the mutual information and the normalized cross - correlation may be considered as two complementary quantities characterizing nonrenewal transport statistics .",
    "statistics of current fluctuations in the system of two capacitively coupled quantum dots and the anderson model in the infinite bias limit have been studied applying the markovian master equation . using the joint distribution of two successive waiting times between transport events",
    "it was demonstrated that both systems exhibit the nonrenewal behavior  the successive waiting times are correlated . the correlation between waiting times is a result of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "two mechanisms , the telegraphic switching and the cascade - like behavior , were identified to generate the positive and the negative cross - correlation of subsequent waiting times respectively .",
    "the former mechanism , occurring in both analyzed systems , is associated with the stochastic switching between different values of tunneling rates , which is a result of their dependence on the charge configuration of the system .",
    "the latter mechanism , occurring in the anderson model , is a result of the nearly - simultaneous occurrence of two electron tunnelings which fill the dot , thus blocking the transport for a certain time . from the formal point of view",

    "since the waiting time cross - correlation depends on the transport mechanism , it seems to be a useful quantity characterizing the electronic transport in mesoscopic systems . in particular",
    ", it can be useful for identifying the cause of the noise enhancement , since its two most common mechanisms  the telegraphic switching and the dynamical channel blockade  can be distinguished by the presence or absence of waiting time correlations .",
    "the nonrenewal dynamics also has a profound influence on the results provided by two more common approaches to the study of current fluctuations , the full counting statistics and the single waiting time distribution .",
    "this influence is associated with the presence of relations between these approaches , which are valid only in the case of the renewal dynamics .",
    "when such relations do not hold , it can be inferred that the dynamics is nonrenewal .",

    "this finding contrasts with the case of the renewal dynamics , when such distributions are equivalent and related to fcs . in consequence ,",
    "the presence of correlations increases the number of independent measurable quantities , which may be useful for reconstructing the transport mechanism of the system on the basis of current fluctuations statistics",
    ". moreover , the nonrenewal dynamics breaks some relations between the zero - frequency fcs , wtd and the second - order current correlation function @xmath56 .",
    "this hinders the reconstruction of wtd on the basis of @xmath56 , but on the other hand enables to infer the presence of waiting time correlations without direct measurement of wtd , which can extend the analysis of nonrenewal current fluctuations to the systems to which the single electron counting is not applicable .",
    "the presented results should be experimentally verifiable using state - of - the - art techniques",
    ". moreover , the paper may give motivation for reanalysis of the already existing experimental data .",

    "<S> the distribution of waiting times between successive tunneling events is an already established method to characterize current fluctuations in mesoscopic systems . </S>",
    "<S> here , i investigate mechanisms generating correlations between subsequent waiting times in two model systems , a pair of capacitively coupled quantum dots and a single - level dot attached to spin - polarized leads . </S>",
    "<S> waiting time correlations are shown to give an insight into the internal dynamics of the system , for example they allow distinction between different mechanisms of the noise enhancement . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , the presence of correlations breaks the validity of the renewal theory . </S>",
    "<S> this increases the number of independent cumulants of current fluctuation statistics , thus providing additional sources of information about the transport mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> i also propose a method for inferring the presence of waiting time correlations based on low - order current correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> this method gives a way to extend the analysis of nonrenewal current fluctuations to the systems for which single - electron counting is not experimentally feasible . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental relevance of the findings is also discussed , for example reanalysis of previous results concerning transport in quantum dots is suggested . </S>"
