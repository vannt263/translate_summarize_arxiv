    "most of the modeling performed in the area of systems biology aims at achieving a quantitative description of intracellular pathways .",
    "hence , most available models describe a  typical cell  on the basis of experimental data .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data are in general obtained using cell population experiments , e.g.  western blotting .",
    "if the considered population is highly heterogeneous , meaning that there is a large cell - cell variability , fitting a single cell model to cell population data can lead to biologically meaningless results . to understand the dynamical behavior of heterogeneous cell populations it is crucial to develop integrated cell population models .",
    "modeling on the population scale has already been addressed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these authors demonstrated that populations can show a bimodal response if stochasticity in biochemical reactions is considered .",
    "but besides stochasticity in biochemical reactions there are other reasons which can also lead to heterogeneity in populations .",
    "examples are unequal partitioning of cellular material at cell division @xcite , genetic and epigenetic differences @xcite .    for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we describe heterogeneity in populations by differences in parameter values of the model describing the single cell dynamics .",
    "the network structure is assumed to be identical in all cells , as this usually represents the physical interactions among molecules , which should be independent of the cell s state .",
    "this parametric approach is well suited for genetic and epigenetic differences .",
    "the distribution of parameter values within the cell population of interest is described by a multivariate probability density function , which is part of the model specification .    in the following the problem of estimating the parameter distribution function",
    "is studied .",
    "therefore , we consider high - throughput experimental methods such as flow cytometry , which can be used to measure concentration distributions within cell populations by suitable fluorescent labeled antibodies .",
    "classical flow cytometry devices can measure several thousand cells per second .",
    "to estimate the parameter distributions , in a first step , an appropriate population model has to be found . in the literature mathematical models of cell populations",
    "are either described as cell ensembles @xcite , or as a non - linear partial differential equation ( pde ) for the distribution of the state variables @xcite . in case of ensemble models ,",
    "a differential equation is assigned to each cell , making an in depth theoretical analysis difficult .",
    "pde models , which describe the time evolution of the distributions of the state variables based on the single cell models , are easy to handle from a theoretical point of view but hard to simulate for a large state dimension of the single cell model .",
    "therefore , only low dimensional pde models of populations have been studied in literature so far @xcite .    in this paper a pde model for the state distribution within a heterogeneous cell population",
    "is derived .",
    "given the solution of this pde the probability density of measuring a certain output can be determined . as for the estimation",
    "only the measured outputs are required , a numerical method for computing the output distribution is outlined .",
    "this methods employs a particle - based approach @xcite and classical density estimation @xcite .",
    "based on these efficient computation scheme for the population response an estimation method is developed . a statistical model of the measured output distribution",
    "is derived from the single cell measurement obtained at every measurement instance .",
    "therefore , again kernel density estimators are used as they have better asymptotic properties than commonly used naive estimators @xcite . given a model and the output distribution estimated from the measurement , a @xmath0-norm minimization",
    "is performed over the set of possible parameter distributions . by employing the model properties and a parameterization of the parameter distribution",
    "this optimization problem is convex and can be solved efficiently .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2 , the problem of estimating the parameter distribution is introduced . in section 3 ,",
    "we present the statistical model for the measured data and the simulation model for state and output distribution . section 4",
    "gives a short overview of the used identification procedure before in section 5 the proposed method is applied to a caspase activation model with artificial data .",
    "_ notation : _ consider the @xmath1-dimensional hypersurface @xmath2 .",
    "the integral @xmath3 of a function @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , over @xmath6 is written as @xmath7 furthermore , the @xmath8.th unit vector is denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "for the purpose of this work , a model of a biochemical reaction network in a population of @xmath10 cells is given by the collection of differential equations @xmath11 with state variables @xmath12 , measured variables @xmath13 , and parameters @xmath14 .",
    "the index @xmath8 specifies the individual cells within the population .",
    "the parameters @xmath15 can be kinetic constants , e.g. reaction rates or binding affinities .",
    "the cell - cell interaction of the considered pathway is assumed to be negligible , as it is the case in many _ in vitro _ lab experiments .    in the following heterogeneity within the cell population",
    "is introduced , modeled by differential parameter values and initial conditions among individual cells .",
    "the distribution of parameters @xmath15 and initial conditions @xmath16 is given by a probability density function @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "for ease of notation , we write @xmath19 .",
    "the probability density function @xmath20 is part of the model specification and the parameters and initial conditions of cell @xmath8 are subject to the probability distribution @xmath21    as outlined in section [ sec : intro ] , for the study of cell populations high - throughput cell population measurements are available . using these experimental techniques protein concentrations within thousands of cells can be measured at every measurement instance , @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this yields the measurement data @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the measured output of the cell @xmath8 and @xmath26 is the index set of the cells measured at time @xmath22 .",
    "note that the cells can not be tracked over time , and are removed from the population in order to obtain the measurements .",
    "thus , no single - cell time series data are available . on the other hand ,",
    "the samples are independent and equally distributed and @xmath27 is assumed to be large , such that an approximation of the output distribution is possible .    like most measurement devices ,",
    "also high - throughput fluorescence measurements are subject to noise . for the rest of the paper , noise consisting of a relative and an absolute part",
    "is considered , @xmath28 in which @xmath25 is the measured output and @xmath29 is a vector of @xmath30-normally distributed random variables with probability density functions @xmath31 yielding the joint probability density @xmath32 @xmath33-normally distributed random variables are chosen here , since they are a good model for the commonly seen noise distributions of the considered measurement device and conserve the positivity of all variables . for notational simplicity the measurement errors of the different concentrations are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "this constraint can be removed easily .    given this setup",
    "the problem we are concerned with is :    given the measurement data @xmath34 , @xmath23 , the cell population model , and the noise model , determine the parameter distribution @xmath35 .",
    "unfortunately , estimation of @xmath35 using a cell population model with a finite number of cells and discrete sampled data is fairly difficult as no single cell trajectories are available .",
    "a far more natural approach would be to use a density description , as the available measurement data can be interpreted as samples drawn from the probability density function of the output .",
    "this interpretation is also quite appealing from a point of modeling as the number of cells considered in a standard lab experiment is of the order of @xmath36 and hence nevertheless too large to be simulated on an individual basis . in the next chapter a pde model for the probability density of the output and a density model for the measurement data",
    "is derived .",
    "as outlined in the previous section , a continuous statistical model for the measurement data , as well as for the evolution of the state and output density would be preferable .",
    "these two aspects are addressed in the following .",
    "the data collected by the considered measurement devices @xmath34 are samples drawn from the distribution of the measured output , as mentioned in section [ sec : prob ] .",
    "let @xmath37 be the distribution of the measured outputs @xmath38 at time @xmath22 .",
    "as @xmath37 is considered to be a probability density , classical density estimation methods can be employed for estimating @xmath37 from the given samples @xmath34 .    in this work",
    ", the problem of determining @xmath37 from @xmath34 is approached using kernel density estimators .",
    "kernel density estimators are non - parametric approaches to estimate probability distributions from sampled data @xcite .",
    "they are widely used and can be thought of as placing probability  bumps  at each observation , as depicted in figure [ fig : kde ] .",
    "these  bumps  are the kernel function @xmath39 , with @xmath40 . note that here only the equations for the one dimensional case are given .",
    "the extension towards higher dimensions is straightforward and can be found in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a gaussian kernel given by @xmath41 with standard deviation @xmath42 is used . in this context",
    ", @xmath42 is also called smoothing parameter in the literature @xcite .",
    "given the kernel @xmath39 an estimator of the probability density for a given set of samples @xmath34 is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the cardinality of @xmath26 .",
    "the selection of the smoothing parameter @xmath42 is crucial and depends strongly on @xmath44 . in this work @xmath42",
    "is chosen according to the least - squares cross - validation method @xcite .",
    "as @xmath44 is considered to be of order @xmath45 , it can be assumed that the the estimated output distribution ins close to the actual output distribution .     for the measured outputs ( o ) and the associated gaussian kernels (   ) .",
    "]      as outlined previously , a continuous model for the output density is desirable for the purpose of parameter identification .",
    "therefore , a pde model for the cell population is derived in the next step .    at first",
    "the single cell model is transformed in an extended state space model @xmath46 in which the parameters are appended to the state vector , @xmath47^t \\in \\mathbb{r}^{n+q}$ ] with @xmath48 and @xmath49",
    ". this system can also be written as @xmath50 to which we refer as the extended state space representation .    based on , the pde model for the population is derived .",
    "the state variable of this pde is the state distribution function @xmath51 , which is defined on the extended state space .",
    "based on the distribution function @xmath52 , the probability of picking at random a cell from the population with states @xmath53 at time @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 to determine the pde for @xmath52 , an infinitesimal volume @xmath56 of the extended state space is considered , with @xmath57 $ ] . for the 2-dimensional case",
    "this is depicted in figure  [ fig : fem ] .     of the extended state space , with fluxes across the boundaries.,width=264 ]    for this infinitesimal volume the flux and storage balance is , @xmath58 the left hand side of the equation represents the storage term and the right hand side the fluxes across the boundaries .",
    "the fluxes @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by the surface integral of the product of boundary distribution and entering velocity , determined by the single cell dynamics , @xmath61 in which @xmath62 .",
    "next , and are used to derive the pde for the time evolution of @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , at first the storage term is expanded using its taylor series , yielding @xmath64 here it is assumed that @xmath65 @xmath66 . in a second step",
    "the flux difference @xmath67 is rewritten , @xmath68 the first line follows from the definition of @xmath69 and the taylor series expansion of @xmath70 . to obtain the second line",
    "the integration is carried out .",
    "the final reformulation is the expansion of the time integral in , resulting in @xmath71 substituting and in the flux balance and dividing by @xmath72 then yields , @xmath73 given this the pde governing the evolution of @xmath63 is obtained by taking the limits @xmath74 and @xmath75 , leading to @xmath76 for sufficiently smooth @xmath63 .",
    "this final equation is somehow what we expected , a transport equation with position dependent transport direction and velocity , according to the single cell dynamics .",
    "the initial condition of is the initial distribution on the extended state space , @xmath77    from the state distribution @xmath52 , the output distribution @xmath78 is computed as the integral of the state distribution along @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the resulting partial differential equation system is @xmath82 where @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",

    "| \\mathrm{diag}(\\eta^1 ) y + \\eta^2 = \\psi \\rbrace$ ] .      in order to study the time evolution of the output distribution @xmath87 and the measured output distribution @xmath86 equation has to be solved for given @xmath20 .",
    "as @xmath63 is defined on the @xmath90-dimensional space , standard grid based solvers are not able to solve for @xmath91 .",
    "theoretically , the methods of characteristics can be used @xcite but for the high dimensional system we are going to study , also this method is difficult to apply . instead , a stochastic method is used , which is known from particle filtering @xcite .",
    "this stochastic integration method is based on a particle description of the model , which is in our case equivalent to the cell ensemble model . to compute @xmath37 , at first a set of samples @xmath92 ,",
    "is drawn from @xmath35 , where @xmath93 is the number of samples .",
    "for this set of samples the single cell model is simulated , resulting in a set of simulated outputs @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is then corrupted by noise according to resulting in @xmath96 .",
    "given this a numerical approximation of @xmath86 can be determined using the kernel density estimator described in section [ subsec : data modeling ] .",
    "this numerical stochastic approximation the output of can be shown to converge as @xmath97 .",
    "hence , the measured output distribution @xmath37 can be axproximated also for high dimensional nonlinear systems .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sec : prob ] the problem studied in this work is the estimation of the parameter distribution @xmath20 from the data @xmath34 .",
    "this problem is approached in the following by minimizing the @xmath0-norm of the model - data mismatch , @xmath98 in which @xmath99 is the distribution of the measured output @xmath100 obtained by simulation with the parameter distribution @xmath101 . according to the cost @xmath102 , the optimal parameter distribution @xmath103 is than given by @xmath104 \\textnormal{subject to } \\ ; \\int_{\\mathbb{r}^{n+q}_+ } \\hat{\\phi}(\\xi ) d\\xi = 1   \\\\[1ex ] \\hspace{20 mm } \\hat{\\phi}(\\xi ) \\geq 0 \\ , \\forall \\xi\\in\\mathbb{r}^{n+q}_+ , \\end{array } \\label{eq : op finite}\\ ] ] where the last two constraints enforce that @xmath101 is a probability distribution .    in the whole section the measured outputs @xmath86",
    "are compared with the noise corrupted simulated output @xmath99 .",
    "this is possible as we assume a large number of measured cells per measurement instant and therefore have good statistics on the measurement error .    . ]",

    "programmed cell death , also called apoptosis , is an important physiological process to remove infected , malfunctioning , or no longer needed cells from a multicellular organism . pathways to induce apoptosis converge at the caspase activation cascade @xcite .",
    "a mathematical model for this network has been proposed by @xcite . here",
    ", we consider the caspase activation in response to an external death receptor stimulus , e.g. the tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) .",
    "as seen from experimental cytotoxicity assays , the cellular response to a tnf stimulus is highly heterogeneous , with some cells dying and others surviving . to understand the process at the physiological level it is thus crucial to consider the cellular heterogeneity , using for example cell population modeling .",
    "the reactions for the single cell model are given by @xmath124 for nominal parameter values , we refer to the original publication @xcite . in comparison to the original model , we added reaction @xmath125 for the initiator caspase 8 ( c8 ) activation by the tnf receptor complexes ( tnfr ) .",

    "these two quantities were chosen as it is known from experiments that there is a high cell - cell variability .",

    "the noise properties are assumed to be known and have been set to @xmath134 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , corresponding to an average measurement error of more than 20 percent .    ]",
    ".,title=\"fig : \" ] ;    based on these data , the approach presented in section  [ sec : estimation ] is used to obtain an estimate for the parameter distribution . for this purpose",

    "the obtained estimation result is depicted in figure  [ fig : ex est ] .",
    "it is obvious that the estimated parameter distribution approximates the real parameter distribution very well , especially considering the finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "hence , even though there is an average measurement error of 20 @xmath141 on the single cell measurement , due to good statistics at the population level , the actual parameter distributions can be estimated accurately .",
    "furthermore , this study shows that in principle , measuring one concentration can give enough information to estimate several parameter distributions , if the output distribution is sensitive with respect to these parameters .",
    "heterogeneity in cell populations is an important issue for research in systems biology .",
    "however , so far only few models describing heterogeneous populations of cells with more than one state variable have been developed . in this paper",
    "a partial differential equation model describing the time evolution of the state distribution is derived .",
    "we focused hereby in particular on the distribution of the measured outputs .    in the second part of the paper , the model of the noise corrupted measured outputs and its particular properties are used to estimate the parameter distributions underlying the heterogeneity .",
    "therefore , a density - based statistical model of the sampled single cell used in combinations with @xmath0-norm based convex optimization .    finally , we applied the developed estimation method to artificial data of a medium size bistable system modeling the caspase activation cascade .",
    "it could be shown that the proposed method yields good estimation results in case of a setup which is realistic in terms of noise and amount of available data .",
