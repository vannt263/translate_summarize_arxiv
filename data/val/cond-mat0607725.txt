    "calciumfluoride ( caf@xmath5 ) is a key material for building refractive optical elements in the deep ultra violet ( duv ) range of the electromagnetic spectrum . especially for structuring microchips an optical system in the duv range",
    "is of extreme technical importance .",
    "the reason for this is that the smallest possible structure size , which can be obtained by a microlithographic process is proportional to the wavelength of the radiation used for structuring . in the last years immense effort",
    "has been made in order to provide large single crystals of caf@xmath5 with high optical quality .",
    "these microlithographic processes are performed at wavelengths of excimer laser radiation sources .",
    "these are mainly 193 nm ( arf excimer laser ) , 157 nm ( f@xmath5 excimer laser ) and 248 nm ( krf excimer laser ) .",
    "caf@xmath5 is chosen as an optical material due to its cubic crystal structure with ( nearly @xcite ) perfect optical isotropy , due to its chemical durability and its mechanical properties which make it applicable for lens fabrication .",
    "recently high purity single crystals have been grown with impurity concentrations below the ppm level .",
    "however , even in these pure single crystals a finite probability for absorption processes remains .",
    "since any absorption process allows for a deposition of energy in the crystal , any energy deposition will in turn lead to a change of material properties . therefore there",
    "exists strong interest to further our understanding of the microscopic mechanism beyond uv absorption in fluoride crystals .    in the past",
    "there have been a large number of investigations on charge centers in fluoride crystals in the early 70th ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main driving forces at that time was to find materials for color center lasers and hosts which show zero phonon lines for spectral hole burning .",
    "further on caf@xmath5 is used as a model system for ionic conductivity since the f - sub lattice melts approximately 100k below the melting point of the crystal . since that time",
    "the quality of the crystals was increased dramatically to to the needs of the semiconductor industry for refractive optical materials in the deep uv wavelength range .    even in an ideal material , where no point defects are present",
    ", electromagnetic radiation can be absorbed with a small but finite probability via a two photon process @xcite .",
    "such an absorption process will therefore quadratically increase with increasing radiation intensity and becomes of strong importance with increasing radiation intensity .",
    "such a two photon process will separate charges and will create an electron  hole pair , provided the sum of the energy of the two photons exceeds the 11.2 ev of the excitonic two particle bound state of the @xmath6exciton @xcite . above this energy a large probability for absorption is present @xcite .",
    "the charges of the electron and the hole have further the possibility to lower their energy by distorting the surrounding lattice .",
    "this means that a localization of the electron ",
    "hole pair takes place together with a lattice distortion .",
    "the resulting state is called an @xmath0-@xmath1-pair @xcite or a self trapped exciton ( ste ) @xcite .",
    "this @xmath0-@xmath1-pair can recombine with an optically forbidden transition , which leads to the fluorescence at 278 nm with a relatively large lifetime at room temperature of 1.1@xmath7s @xcite .    in a real material",
    "there are a number of defects present . in this case",
    "the defect concentration is governed by entropy .",
    "the concentration at room temperature is in this case not necessarily determined by its room - temperature equilibrium value .",
    "this is due to the fact that the system falls with respect to defect statistics out of equilibrium already at the crystallization point where defect diffusion becomes strongly hindered .    at high radiation rates the creation of @xmath0-@xmath1-pairs provides the major source towards radiation dependent change of optical material properties of caf@xmath5 .",
    "due to thermal diffusion the charge centers can move around in the material . above 170 k @xcite",
    "the charge centers are known to be mobile .",
    "this mobility increases on one site the probability of recombination of @xmath0 and @xmath1centers . on the other site mobile charge centers",
    "can be trapped by point defects and impurities in the material which can lead to room temperature stable charge centers .",
    "these temperature dependence is a strong hint that activation energies for diffusive transport of charge centers are of crucial importance when understanding radiation dependent change in material properties of caf@xmath5 . in the present paper",
    "we calculate energies for charge center formation and derive the necessary microscopic parameters for charge center diffusion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : interact ] we phenomenologically describe the interaction between radiation and the fluoride crystal . in section",
    "[ sec : band ] we discuss the band structure of caf@xmath5 which is needed as a starting point when investigating the localized charge centers . in the next section [ sec : struct_f_h ]",
    "we report calculation on a larger unit cell up to ca@xmath8f@xmath9 where either one fluor ion is removed and an electron is localized on the vacancy or where an additional fluor ion has been added forming an essentially positively charged complex where the hole is localized .",
    "the lattice deformation is discussed in subsection [ sec : latt_relax ] and the obtained electronic structure in [ subs_f ] and [ sec : h ] . in section [ sec : equ_f_h ]",
    "we calculate the equilibrium concentrations of @xmath0- and @xmath1-centers in an as grown crystal .",
    "for a qualitative understanding of the dynamic processes involving charge center formation and charge center motion we follow the arguments of @xcite .",
    "we assume that a two photon process creates a pair of an @xmath0-center and a @xmath1-center which are spatially uncorrelated .",
    "there is further no long range interaction between these pairs an assumption which is physically justified by the screening of the coulomb potential .",
    "further all interaction between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 centers is neglected .",
    "that means we assume an uniform density for both centers .",
    "this approximation gets exact in the dilute limit .",
    "this means that the two particle correlation functions @xmath10 is assumed to have the uniform value @xmath11 . as the only driving force for @xmath0-@xmath1-pair recombination we assume statistical fluctuations of the charge center positions .",
    "@xmath12 and for the non - diagonal correlation function we assume : @xmath13 with the above approximations we can directly write down a system of rate equations for the creation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 center in the ideal material .",
    "@xmath14 the first term on the right site creates pairs of @xmath0- and @xmath1 charge centers .",
    "this creation goes via a two photon process and is therefore proportional to the squared radiation intensity @xmath15 .",
    "the second term on the right site of eq . ( [ eq : id_sys ] ) describes the recombination of particles .",
    "this recombination is proportional to the probability of finding two particles within a distance smaller than the recombination radius @xmath16 and is proportional to the effective recombination rate @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the diffusion constants for @xmath0-center and @xmath1-center diffusion .",
    "the temperature dependence of these diffusion constants is known from @xcite as : @xmath21 with @xmath22 ev and @xmath23 ev . in order to obtain microscopic information on the material parameters needed for charge center diffusion , we do an ab initio calculation of the charge centers together with the resulting lattice distortions . among other results",
    "we also confirm a well known result @xcite that there is a strong asymmetry between the number of @xmath0-centers and @xmath1-centers in caf@xmath5 . at the melting point of the f - sublattice , where the system falls out of equilibrium with respect to its defect concentration",
    "there is already a reasonable number of @xmath0-centers present but there are practically no @xmath1-centers ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : equ_f_h ] ) .",
    "in the present work we use a commercially available density functional package ( vasp @xcite ) . the code is a plane - wave code which uses ultrasoft preudopotentials .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is used to calculate the exchange correlation energy . through most of the calculation we set the plane wave cutoff for the numerical evaluation of the electron density to 500 ev .",
    "this was due to restriction of computer time . in appendix",
    "[ sec : convergence ] we show that this choice is in general sufficient . for the larger clusters with 32 ca ions and 64 f ions in section [ sec : struct_f_h ] we perform a @xmath6point calculation , which corresponds to a k - mesh of 0.575 @xmath24 .",
    "the criterion for the electronic convergence was set to @xmath25 .",
    "as a starting point the band structure of caf@xmath5 has been calculated . the resulting bandstructure is in well agreement with experiments and other ab initio calculations @xcite .",
    "as expected for a pure dft calculation the resulting band gap is with 7.7ev too small compared with the 11.8ev which are measured experimentally .",
    "a screened exchange calculation improves the too small band gap .",
    "@xcite also a similar calculation which uses an interpolation between dft and hartree ",
    "fock approximation @xcite arrives at a similar result .",
    "details on the band structure together with a calculation of phonon modes which are compared to neutron scattering results can be found in @xcite . in @xcite also",
    "mechanical properties of caf@xmath5 and other fluorites are calculated .",
    "in order to calculate charge centers we set up a cluster of ca@xmath26f@xmath27 using periodic boundary conditions . due to the large size of the elementary cell calculations are performed using one k - point only ( @xmath6-point calculation ) .",
    "removing one f atom and allowing for a relaxation of the structure into the energy minimum gives an @xmath0-center .",
    "adding an f atom and allowing for structural relaxation is a configuration of a @xmath1-center .",
    "for the structural relaxation , which takes account of the lattice deformation , the size of the elementary cell was kept fix . in order to obtain charge neutrality in the clusters an extra positive charge is trapped near the additional f ion and an extra negative charge is trapped in the f - ion vacancy . due to the periodic boundary conditions a periodic array of charge centers is calculated where the distance is equal to four lattice constants . since the electronic wave functions of such local defects drop of exponentially there should be a small but finite interaction between the charge centers . a check for finite size effects due to defect ",
    "defect interaction is made using larger systems of ca@xmath8f@xmath9 cluster and shown in section [ sec : finite_size ] .",
    "removing one f - atom leads to a cluster with ca@xmath26f@xmath29 . since the f - atom had an electron closely attached to it , this electron is now localized in the f  vacancy .",
    "a defect level with an exponentially decaying wave function is created in the band gap , where the chemical potential moves in .",
    "this leads to a half filled single electron level , where the electron can be excited with a photon leading to an absorption in the optical transmission spectrum .",
    "such a half filled state has a spin of @xmath30 which makes it possible for spin resonance measurements @xcite to observe the defect . as a next step a relaxation of the structure",
    "is performed . as a result",
    "there is only minor change in the structure .",
    "the electronic band structure of the resulting defect is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . the resulting change in electronic density compared to the undisturbed configuration",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the additional charge is well localized at the defect and only weak lattice distortion is seen .",
    "the symmetry of the @xmath0-center is tetrahedron symmetry t@xmath31- in appendix [ sec : group ] we calculate the splitting of excited energy levels due to the tetrahedron symmetry using arguments from group theory .",
    "a pair of two @xmath0center is called an @xmath4-center .",
    "usually entropy will be the dominant driving force for a homogeneous distribution of @xmath0centers .",
    "on the other hand the overall lattice distortion which is needed to trap an electron as a @xmath0center can be reduced if two @xmath0center join forming an @xmath4center . by removing a second f@xmath28ion from our cluster with periodic boundary conditions we create an @xmath4center .",
    "herby the two @xmath0center can be oriented along different directions in the crystal .",
    "we investigate @xmath4center in the 100 direction , the 110 and 111 direction . in the latter case",
    "we have two possibilities .",
    "one where a ca@xmath32 is in between the two missing f@xmath28ions and the second one with an empty space in between . by calculating the difference in total energy between an @xmath4center ( ca@xmath26f@xmath33 ) and a ca@xmath26f@xmath27 cluster in comparison with twice the total energy of a @xmath0center configuration we obtain an expression for the agglomeration energy of two @xmath0center forming an @xmath4center .",
    "@xmath34 we can think of this configuration as taking two @xmath0center infinite distance away from each other and comparing this state with two @xmath0center on nearest ( or next - nearest or next - next - nearest ) neighbor sites .",
    "the result is summarized in table [ tab : m - cent ] .",
    "the configuration where the two @xmath0-center are on nearest neighbor sites orientized along the 100 direction is the most preferred one .      for a configuration which is used as a starting point for the @xmath1@xmath35center ,",
    "a f - ion is replaced by a pair of f - ions where according to @xcite the line connecting the two f - atoms points along the 110 direction . in this way",
    "a ca@xmath26f@xmath36cluster is obtained . after a relaxation of the structure a stable configuration with localized defect level in the band gap",
    "is obtained .",
    "the resulting band structure is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "the charge distribution is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the additional positive charge is located in the center of four f@xmath28 ions . in this way",
    "a f@xmath2 complex is created .",
    "this is opposite to the standard literature e.g. @xcite were the @xmath1center is described as a f@xmath3 complex .",
    "the result of the calculation is very clear therefore there is little doubt on the quality of the result . in the 70th",
    "when the microscopic models of the charge centers in fluoride crystals have been developed , there was no possibility to perform such a detailed microscopic calculation .",
    "the details of the geometry of the four f - ions which form the f@xmath2 center is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "one can further see that the @xmath1-center is accompanied by a very large lattice distortion .",
    "this means that a large part of the energy , which is needed to create a localized but unbound electron ",
    "hole pair originates from lattice distortion around the @xmath1-center",
    ". therefore the main part of the energy which is gained by trapping an electron  hole pair as a self  trapped exciton ( ste ) comes from the release of the lattice distortion around the @xmath1-center when a @xmath0-center is close .",
    "in addition this is the reason , why it was not possible in the past to observe single @xmath1-centers .",
    "usually a crystal is cooled down from the melting point and falls out of thermodynamic equilibrium with respect to its defect concentration at a temperature which is shortly below the melting point . at that temperature",
    "a large number of f@xmath28 vacancies is present but only a very small number of interstitial f - ions .",
    "this means that the crystal even at the slowest cooling rates never reaches its thermodynamical equilibrium at zero temperature , where each f@xmath28 position is occupied by a f - ion .",
    "in fact there will be a reasonably large number of f@xmath28 vacancies . by heating the crystal and quenching it down to liquid nitrogen temperatures it is possible to additively color the system by creating @xmath0-centers .",
    "this argument is quantified in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : equ_f_h ] .",
    "a defect which is discussed in caf@xmath5 as well is the v@xmath37-center . in the v@xmath37-center",
    "two f@xmath28-ions are shifted out of their equilibrium positions forming an f@xmath3-molecule .",
    "we did not find a stable configuration for such a bare center and believe that it is only stabilized in the vicinity of dopant ions .      in the following the energy to create an electron ",
    "hole pair in the form of an @xmath0-@xmath1-pair is calculated .",
    "this is the total energy of an @xmath0-@xmath1-pair .",
    "the undisturbed lattice has a total energy of -17.696 ev per caf@xmath5 unit . for a ca@xmath26f@xmath27",
    "this is @xmath38 ev .",
    "a @xmath0-@xmath1-pair which has infinite distance is the electronic and fully converged structure of a ca@xmath26f@xmath29 cluster plus the structure of a ca@xmath26f@xmath36 cluster . @xmath39 via an optically forbidden transition the @xmath0-@xmath1-pair can recombine with the relative long lifetime of 1.1 @xmath7s and finally relax into the undisturbed configuration .",
    "the ste fluorescence which corresponds to the @xmath0-@xmath1-pair recombination is known to be at 278 nm @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] we show a schematic plot of the energy scheme which relates the measured 278 nm which is a photon energy of 4.463 ev to the calculated energy difference of 8.17 ev .",
    "in subsections [ subs_f ] and [ sec : h ] we saw that there is a strong asymmetry in the energy which is needed to produce a @xmath0- or @xmath1-center .",
    "the main reason for this asymmetry lies in the strong lattice distortion which results when adding a f - ion into an interstitial lattice site in order to create a @xmath1-center .",
    "we now estimate the concentration of @xmath0- and @xmath1-center which is obtained when the system falls out of equilibrium .",
    "therefore we compare the total energy of fluorine in the four possible configurations .",
    "( i ) as flour in the regular caf@xmath5 lattice ,",
    "( ii ) as flour in an interstitial lattice site , ( iii ) the energy gain which is obtained when removing a f@xmath28 ion in order to create an @xmath0-center and ( iv ) the fluor in the f@xmath5 atom of gaseous fluor . from section [ sec : latt_relax ] we know that the energy which is needed to create a @xmath0-@xmath1-pair is 8.17 ev .",
    "we now ask how this energy is distributed between the @xmath0- and the @xmath1-center . for the @xmath0-center",
    "we obtain : @xmath40 which is the energy gain when creating the @xmath0-center and forming half of a f@xmath5 molecule . in @xcite a much larger value ( @xmath417.9 ev )",
    "is obtained for @xmath0@xmath28center formation by comparing to the energy of a bare f atom instead of a f@xmath5 molecule .",
    "this is in agreement with older ab - initio studies @xcite , where small clusters of only 18 ions where studied and a diffusion activation energy for the @xmath0-center of 1.69 ev results . for the @xmath1-center we obtain in the similar way : @xmath42 the sum of both energies gives 8.023 ev which is the energy needed to create an @xmath0-@xmath1-pair . in principle one should add in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def ] ) and subtract in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deh ] ) the chemical potential of a corresponding f@xmath5 gas phase , which in general depends on temperature and pressure @xmath43 and @xmath44 . for simplicity and due to a lack of knowledge of the detailed environment",
    ", we set this term to zero .",
    "the point where the system falls out of equilibrium with respect to its f - ion concentration is given by the melting temperature of the flour sub - lattice in caf@xmath5 .",
    "this occurs at approximately 1500k which is 150k below the melting point of the crystal . at this temperature",
    "the equilibrium concentration of @xmath0-center is : @xmath45 and for the @xmath1-center also at a temperature of 1500 k it is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the volume of the elementary cell .",
    "this result means that in ideally grown crystal there is already a strong asymmetry between fluor vacancies and fluor interstitial .",
    "there are practically no @xmath1-centers but already a finite number of @xmath0-centers . using the molar weight , the density of caf@xmath5 and the avogadro constant , @xmath48",
    ", we can calculate the molar concentration of charge centers in thermal equilibrium at different temperatures and as well an absolute particle number in @xmath49 .",
    "this is done in table [ tab : tabfhconc ] . to calculate the equilibrium densities in @xmath49 we used @xmath50 where @xmath51 g / mol is the molar weight of caf@xmath5",
    ", @xmath52 g/@xmath53 the density of caf@xmath5 and the avogadro number .",
    "there is even a very small but finite change in the density of the material due to the equilibrium concentration of f - vacancies .",
    "this change in density is : @xmath54 from that follows that an extremely inhomogeneous distribution of charge centers can in principle have an influence on the density homogeneity of the material and therefore also on the refractive index homogeneity .",
    "since , however , the bare charge centers are mobile at room temperature , this process will lead to a homogeneous distribution already .      in order to estimate finite size effects we configured a larger cluster with ca@xmath8f@xmath9 for the unperturbed configuration .",
    "in this cluster the resulting configuration for the @xmath0-center and for the @xmath1-center from the smaller clusters was inserted .",
    "for these calculations we restricted ourself to a plane wave cutoff of 400 ev only due to limitations of computer power .",
    "after this first one electronic configuration was performed and the forces on the ions where calculated . as a result",
    "there is still a non negligible finite size effect present . for the @xmath0-center",
    "we obtain : @xmath55 if we allow for a structural relaxation in the larger cluster we get : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the total energy of a single caf@xmath5 unit cell and @xmath58 is the total energy of the cluster from subsection [ subs_f ] and @xmath59 is the total energy of the large superstructure .",
    "the differences in energy result from an interaction between a single charge center and its neighbors due to the periodic boundary conditions of the underlying system .",
    "the major part ( 5.98 ev ) stems from the electronic interaction where s only a small part ( 7.83 ev- 5.98 ev = 1.85 ev ) stems from an interaction between the different lattice distortions around each individual charge center .",
    "therefore the major contribution of the relatively large energy difference originates from the long range coulomb interaction between the charge center and it s neighbors due to the periodic boundary conditions .    for the @xmath1-center we obtain from a similar calculation for the electronic part only : @xmath60 and for the structural relaxation",
    "we get : @xmath61 in this case as well the electronic part ( 1.15 ev ) as well as the structural part due to the interaction between lattice distortions ( 1.42 ev - 1.15 ev = 0.27 ev ) .",
    "the reason why finite size effects are much smaller for the @xmath1-center is due to the more efficient screening of the coulomb charges in the case of the @xmath1-center . in this case",
    "there is a much larger but also much stronger localized lattice distortion which leads to more strongly localized electronic wavefunctions of the defect level .",
    "this can be also seen by the weak but still present dispersion of the defect level in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "in the present paper we calculate the ground state of the trapped electron ( bare @xmath0-center ) and of the trapped hole ( bare @xmath1-center ) in caf@xmath5 .",
    "these charge centers are the elementary excitations which are needed to understand the interaction between caf@xmath5 and duv radiation .",
    "since duv radiation can even in an ideal crystal excite electron - hole pairs via a two photon process , the electron or the hole can localize , gaining energy via a lattice distortion .",
    "the formation energy for a @xmath0-@xmath1-pair is , however , unevenly shared between the electron and the hole .",
    "this is the reason why already in an as  grown ",
    "crystal a finite number of @xmath0-centers of the order of 5 ppm is present , while there are no @xmath1-centers present .",
    "this explains why in fluorite crystals there are @xmath0-centers observed but @xmath1-centers are observed only if they are stabilized by impurities . calculating the lattice distortion around the @xmath0-center , we found no surprise .",
    "however when investigating the lattice distortion around the @xmath1-center we found that the state of smallest total energy is a configuration where the direction connecting the two interstitial f ions points along the 110 direction of the crystal .",
    "further the charge is distributed rather around in a f@xmath2 complex rather than in a f@xmath3 complex . for the important problem of radiation stability of caf@xmath5 under intense excimer laser radiation",
    ", the trapping of these charge centers on impurity ions has to be considered .",
    "the radiation stability of caf@xmath5 is of extreme importance for the optical microlithography for structuring semiconductors .",
    "in a strongly ionic crystal like caf@xmath5 there is a large spatial fluctuation of the electron charge .",
    "therefore it is expected that a large number of plane waves ( in k - space ) has to be used to achieve a numerical accuracy which allows quantitative predictions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : conv ] we have plotted the total energy of a caf@xmath5 system as a function of the plane wave cutoff . in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt_cutoff ] we show the resulting lattice constants after a structural relaxation . for cutoff energies of 500 ev and larger the system starts to saturate . to minimize calculation time we have used a plane wave cutoff of 500 ev throughout the calculations of the larger clusters for the calculation of charge centers and impurities in caf@xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : latt_cutoff ] the resulting lattice constant of caf@xmath5 is shown as a function of the cutoff energy .",
    "in this appendix we give a few thoughts about symmetry , which are based on group theoretical arguments .",
    "we assume that a charge center forms a kind of hydrogen atom which is perturbed by the symmetry of the underlying crystalline lattice . in the case of the @xmath0-center",
    "this is obvious since the fluor vacancy forms a net positive charge in which the excess electron is localized due to coulomb attraction .",
    "the point symmetry group of the @xmath0-center is tetrahedron symmetry , t@xmath31 . in the case of the @xmath1-center",
    "this is less obvious .",
    "the excess fluorine ion brings a negative charge which is compensated by a positive charge which is localized among the four f - ions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] .",
    "the point symmetry of the whole @xmath1-center is c@xmath62 .",
    "the optically allowed transitions within the hydrogen atom are given by well known rules which follow from symmetry considerations in the rotation group , o(3)=r+c@xmath63 .",
    "the angular part of the eigenfunctions in the o(3 ) group are the spherical harmonics , d@xmath64 . where @xmath65 is the angular index of the spherical harmonics and @xmath66 the parity ( + or - ) of the wave function .",
    "under the perturbation of the external field these ( 2l+1 ) times degenerate eigenvalues split in a well defined way .",
    "these is given in correlation tables which can be found in standard textbooks of group theory @xcite . in table",
    "[ tab : corr_group ] we give the part of the correlation table which is relevant for the symmetry of the charge centers . from table [",
    "tab : corr_group ] we learn the following important things : ( i ) the splitting of the energy levels in the excited states and second the numbers of independent parameters which are required to expand the crystal field up to fourth order in @xmath65 . in the case of the @xmath0-center only the second excited state splits into a twofold ( e ) and a threefold ( t@xmath67 ) degenerate energy level .",
    "the third excited state splits into three levels , one highly symmetric a@xmath67 and two levels which are each threefold degenerate t@xmath68 and t@xmath5 . in the case of the @xmath1-center",
    "all degeneracies up to fourth order are canceled , already the first excited state splits into three non degenerate energy levels a@xmath67 , b@xmath68 and b@xmath5 . the second excited energy level splits into five different levels and so on . by ( ii ) counting the number of a@xmath68 representations we know the number of independent parameters which are needed for an expansion of the crystal field up to fourth order in @xmath65 . for the @xmath0-center",
    "these are only 3 parameters whereas for the @xmath1-center with its much lower symmetry 11 parameters are required .",
