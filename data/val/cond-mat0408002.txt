    "a large part of statistical mechanics , having to do with the physics of phase transitions and nonlinear properties is based on a rather fundamental generalization , due to landau@xcite , of the well - known gibbs free energy .",
    "there is a functional @xmath9 depending on an ( in general complex )  order parameter \" @xmath10 , given by ,    [ eq12 ] [ * m*(*r * ) ] = d*v * [ - a |*m*|^2 + b |*m*|^4 + c ||^2 - * m * ] ,    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are nonnegative , temperature independent constants .",
    "here @xmath14 represents an external field which couples directly to the order parameter .",
    "this free energy is the backbone of a vast literature@xcite on second order phase transitions , critical phenomena as well as nonlinear properties .",
    "regardless of the microscopic fabric of the system under consideration , near a second order phase transition where universal features appear which are independent of the details of interaction , this free energy contains all of the necessary information .",
    "thus a superconductor or a magnet or a nematic liquid crystal , all have the same ginzburg - landau ( gl ) free energy as long as the appropriate order parameter @xmath15 is identified .",
    "it is however limited to describe only the vicinity of a second order phase transition . when the fluctuations are ignored , the corresponding gibbs free energy @xmath16 , identified as the minimum of the functional @xmath9 , has the temperature dependence of @xmath17 .",
    "according to the classification of phase transitions as proposed by ehrenfest@xcite , the transitions in general can be of any order . in a second order phase transition ,",
    "the specific heat and the compressibility , which are the second order derivatives of the free energy ( with respect to temperature and pressure respectively ) , are discontinuous at the transition . in general",
    "though , the discontinuity is often replaced by a weak , often logarithmic singularity .",
    "one could then view the ehrenfest definition of an order as one where the lower derivatives of the free energy are continuous at the transition but the higher derivatives are singular . thus in a fourth order phase transition , all third order derivatives are continuous , all fifth order derivatives are singular at the transition .",
    "the fourth order derivatives are either discontinuous or are weakly singular .",
    "the generalization of the landau free energy to a higher order phase transition is achieved via a weight function . for a third and a fourth order phase transitions , we need@xcite respectively , within mean field in the sense discussed above , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "this can be obtained from  landau - like \" free energies defined with a weight function : [ eq13 ] f_iii = dv |m|^2 [ - a_3 |m|^2 + b_3 |m|^4 + c_3 |m|^2 ] , [ eq14 ] f_iv = dv |m|^4 [ - a_4 |m|^2 + b_4 |m|^4 + c_4 |m|^2 ] .",

    "the importance of these free energies is highlighted by the recent discovery@xcite of anomalies in the superconducting transition in ( ba@xmath5k@xmath6)bio@xmath7(x = 0.4 ) .",
    "these anomalies , a missing discontinuity in specific heat@xcite as well as in susceptibility@xcite , indicate a phase transition of order higher than second .",
    "the actual order in bkbo has been determined@xcite to be fourth . in another example , the specific heat@xcite in bi2212 ( chemical compound)has been noted to be kink - like , representing a third order phase transition .",

    "we do not know whether it is also the energy gap at the fermi surface , although the tunnelling measurements@xcite seem to be consistent with this identification .",
    "the earlier analysis@xcite has been based on a uniform order parameter , except for some straightforward effects of a magnetic field such as a derivation of the london equation and the temperature dependence of the penetration length .",
    "this paper is aimed at studying the properties of a substantially inhomogeneous order parameter such as found@xcite in defects and textures in the condensed state .",
    "their analysis is sometimes carried out within homotopy theory@xcite where the geometrical / topological aspects can be studied in detail .",
    "these ( geometrical / topological ) properties , characteristic of a mapping between the real space and the order parameter space , will be unaffected by the order of the transition .",
