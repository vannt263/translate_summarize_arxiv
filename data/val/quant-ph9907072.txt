    "quite a number of papers were recently engaged in the nonclassical 4th order interference of independent sources .",
    "it proved to be a powerful tool for checking on possible new quantum principles and features as well as on the nonstandard interpretations of quantum phenomena .",
    "e.g. , dirac s principle _ each photon interferes only with itself seems to be valid only for the standard interference of the 2nd order while for the nonclassical interference of the 4th order it should read : _ each pair of photons interferes only with itself  @xcite . as for the nonstandard interpretations , the nonclassical interference of the 4th order , in particular with the down ",
    "converted beams , was recently used for disproving both local and nonlocal hidden  variable theories . ou and mandel @xcite",
    "have elaborated and carried out a new type of the bell  like experiments against local hidden ",
    "variable theories which was then extended by yurke and stoler @xcite to three independent sources , by ukowski , zeillinger , horne , and ekert @xcite to independent correlated pairs in the configuration space , and by pavii and summhammer @xcite to independent correlated pairs in the spin space . on the other hand wang , zou , and",
    "mandel @xcite carried out an experiment to test de broglie  bohm pilot ( guiding , `` ghost '' ) waves ( without the latter being physically blocked ) according to a set  up proposed by the selleri  croca school and obtained a negative result .",
    "_ _    the afore mentioned extention in the spin space brought us to a new phenomenon  spin correlated interferometry  which asks for an independent elaboration .",
    "so , in this paper we elaborate the _ spin correlated interferometry of the 4th order for two polarized as well as _",
    "unpolarized photons arriving simultaneously at a beam splitter and in a forthcoming paper @xcite the spin correlated interferometry for the independent pairs of spin ( polarization ) correlated photons .",
    "we call the phenomena _ spin correlated interferometry because it turns out that two photons which simulataneously leave a beam splitter , always leave it correlated in spin no matter how they were prepared , _",
    "i.e. , no matter whether they were previously polarized or not .",
    "the interferometry is based on an experiment we put forward in refs .",
    "@xcite which is a realization of the 4th order interference of randomly prepared independent photons correlated in polarization and coming from independent sources .",
    "_ _ _ _    of the two experiments we consider in this paper , the first one puts together two polarized photons , makes them interact on a beam splitter , and allows us inferring the dependence of the typical nonclassical 4th order _ beating on the mutual polarization of the incoming photons when no polarization is measured as well as inferring modulated polarization ( spin ) correlations when it is measured .",
    "the second experiment puts together two unpolarized photons coming out from two simultaneous but independent cascade processes of two simulataneously excited independent atoms , makes them interact on a beam splitter , and then allows us inferring polarization ( spin ) correlations by simultaneous measurement of the polarizations of the photons .",
    "thus we recognize beam splitter as a device for detection and preparation of spin correlation between incoming and/or outgoing photons as well as a source of genuinely unpolarized photons .",
    "this in turn allows us to substitute two additional beam splitters for the above cascade sources .",
    "_    on the other hand , the present elaboration of the 4th order interference on a beam splitter in the spin space attempts to fill a gap in the literature . for ,",
    "while the interference of the 4th order in the configuration space has been elaborated in detail in the literature @xcite , the interference lacks a detailed elaboration and apparently a proper understanding in the spin space .",
    "one of the rare partial elaborations was provided by ou , hong , and mandel for a special case of orthogonally polarized photons @xcite .",
    "they clearly recognized that orthogonally polarized photons incoming to a symmetrically positioned beam splitter produce a _ singlet  like state at a beam splitter @xcite and that parallelly polarized photons incoming to a symmetrically positioned beam splitter never appear on its opposite sides @xcite but it does not seem to have been recognized that the polarization of incoming photons actually does not have any effect on the correlation in polarization of the outgoing photons and that it only affects the intensity of the outgoing photons .",
    "that was also apparently the reason for not realizing that a beam splitter produces not a _ singlet  like state but a genuine singlet state and not only for polarized but for unpolarized incident photons as well . _",
    "_    to be able to follow the main features of the experiments presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] we develop the basic formalism in sec .  [ sec : form ] and we shall calculate the setups in the plane  wave approach in sec .  [",
    "sec : prob ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] we discuss the obtained interference patterns .",
    "the essential part of both experiments  for polarized as well as for unpolarized photons  is presented in fig .",
    "[ exp ] which is , in effect , a slightly modified figure from ref .",
    "the only difference for the two cases below are the sources .",
    "two incoming independent photons in fig .",
    "[ exp ] are emerging as signal and idler photons from a nonlinear crystal as in the experiment of ou and mandel @xcite with the only difference that the polarization rotator can be turned in any appropriate direction without affecting the output correlation .",
    "signal and idler photons of frequences @xmath0 and @xmath1 are produced in the process of parametric down conversion of a laser beam ( of the frequency @xmath2 ) that interacts with the nonlinear crystal ( _ e.g. , liio@xmath3 ) .",
    "_    the two so obtained independent photons are then directed to a beam splitter from opposite sides .",
    "photons coming out from the beam splitter pass polarizers p1 and/or p2 and fall on detectors d1 and/or d2 . in an actual setup a birefringent prisms",
    "should be used for polarizers ( allowing detection of polarization p and the perpendicular polarization p@xmath4 ) so as to enable _ zero detections by appropriate d1@xmath4,d2@xmath4 detectors ( not shown in fig .",
    "[ exp ] ) .",
    "pulse pairs arriving within an appropriate time interval ( typically 5 ns or shorter ) are taken as coincidence counts .",
    "the obtained coincidence counts are ascribed to the probability of detecting two photons for possible settings of incoming and outgoing ( polarizers p1 and p2 ) polarizations .",
    "_    such a setup can however be objected that it fails to adequately record photons when they both go to one arm and when their triggering of the detectors should be disabled . to match this possibility we can use frequency filters ( prisms ) that would separate the photons emerging from the beam splitter according to their frequency and",
    "would direct them to two birefringent polarizers p@xmath5 and p@xmath6 and through them to four detectors d@xmath5,d@xmath7,d@xmath6,d@xmath8 in each arm .",
    "simultaneous firing ( i.e. , within the shortest time feasible ) of at least two detectors in one arm then discards the corresponding recording in both arms from the set of _ coincidence counts .",
    "in such a way we are able to _ preselect a genuine singlet state of the photon pair emerging from different sides of the beam splitter ( see sec .  [",
    "subsubsec : arms ] ) .",
    "the setup also enables an experimental verification of the behavior of photons when they both emerge from the same side of a beam splitter presented in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : arm ] .",
    "_ _      signal and idler down  converted photons emerging from independent nonlinear crystals are parallelly polarized ( @xmath9 relative to the uv pump laser beam @xcite ) .",
    "so , such sources can not be used to obtain unpolarized incoming photons but we have at least two available sources .",
    "one is a cascade process , e.g. , @xmath10",
    ". it can be triggered by a simultaneous pumping of a split laser beam . due to the random phases of photons emitted from two distinct atoms we shall have no interference of the 2nd order at all . in previous experiments where sources of unpolarized photons were needed ,",
    "the sources were poorly localized because a better localization was not necessary .",
    "e.g. , in aspect s experiments @xcite the source atoms where located in a @xmath11 m region , i.e.  within the laser beam waist diameter of the focused pumping laser beam . recently , however , trapping of single atoms ( as opposed to @xmath12 atoms/@xmath13 in aspect s experiment ) down to @xmath14 m has been achieved @xcite .",
    "the other possible sources are two other beam splitters .",
    "for , as will see below , beam splitters emit completely unpolarized photons in particular directions .",
    "of course , the beam splitters would be much easier to handle than cascade processes but we introduced the cascade sources first because of the conceptual clarity they give to the proposal of the experiment .",
    "the rest of the experiment is the same as above for polarized photons .",
    "the state of polarized photons immediately after leaving the sources is described by the product of two prepared linear  polarization states : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the mutually orthogonal photon states .",
    "so , e.g. , @xmath18 means the state of a photon leaving the upper source polarized in direction @xmath19 .",
    "if the beam spliter were removed it would cause a _ `` click '' at the detector d1 and no _ `` click '' at the detector d1@xmath4 provided the birefringent polarizer p1 is oriented along @xmath19 . here",
    "d1@xmath4 means a detector counting photons coming out at the _ other exit p@xmath4 ( perpendicular polarization ; not shown in the fig .",
    "[ exp ] ) of the birefringent prism p1 .",
    "angles @xmath20,@xmath21 are the angles along which incident photons are polarized with respect to a fixed direction . _ _ _    for unpolarized photons",
    "the density matrix is proportional to the unit matrix and this means that we only need products @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath24 to form partial probabilities which then sum up to the total correlation probability as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : prob ] .    to describe the interaction of photons with the beam spliter , polarizers and detectors we use the quantized electric field operators often employed in quantum optical analysis , e.g. , by paul @xcite , mandel s group @xcite , and campos et al .",
    "because we use independent sources , resulting random constant phases will give no interference of the 2nd order so that we dispense with them .",
    "as for polarization we introduce it by means of two orthogonal scalar field components .",
    "thus the scalar components of the stationary electric field operators read : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , * k is the wave vector ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath28 refer to a particular photon in question , @xmath29 is the quantization volume , @xmath30 is the frequency set with a bandwidth @xmath31 , @xmath32 is the annihilation ( lowering ) operator at the angular frequency @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the frequency density of the chosen form for the wave packet . in a subsequent paper",
    "@xcite we use the gaussian wave packets and therefore we have @xmath35^{-1/4 } \\exp{\\left[-\\left({\\omega-\\omega_\\circ\\over   2\\delta\\omega}\\right)^2\\right]}\\,.\\ ] ] *    in this paper we consider only monochromatic waves , i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "so , we deal here with plane waves represented by the following field operators : @xmath38 of course , we tacitly assume that photons must arrive at the beam splitter practically simultaneously , i.e.  with appropriate short delays . in the plane wave approach we can not derive the conditions under which events gain a particular visibility but that does not affect the reasoning here , since only the overall visibility is affected by greater delays . in ref .",
    "@xcite we carry out the appropriate calculations in detail using gaussian wave packets and we show that the experiment is feasible .",
    "the annihilation operators describe joint actions of polarizers , beam splitter , and detectors .",
    "the operators act on the states as follows : @xmath39 ,   @xmath40 ,   @xmath41 , etc .    the action of the beam splitter we describe by the input annihilation operators @xmath42 and @xmath43 operators and the following output ones : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote transmittance and reflectance , respectively .    to take the linear polarization along orthogonal directions into account",
    "we shall consider two sets of operators , i.e. , their matrices @xmath49    so , the action of the polarizers p1,p2 and detectors d1,d2 can be expressed as : @xmath50 where @xmath51 .    projections corresponding to the other choices of polarizers and detectors we obtain by using appropriate transformations instead of the ones given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e2 ] ) .",
    "e.g. , we obtain the action of the polarizer p2@xmath4 ( orthogonal to p2 ; in the experiment p2 and p2@xmath4 make a birefringent prism ) and the corresponding detector d2@xmath4 if we substitute @xmath52 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : d2 ] ) .",
    "hence the appropriate outgoing electric field operators read @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 is time delay after which the photon reaches detector d , @xmath56 is the frequency of photon @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the velocity of light .",
    "the detectors and the crystal are assumed to be positioned symmetrically with regard to the beam splitter so that two time delays suffice .",
    "the joint interaction of both photons with the beam splitter , polarizers p1,p2 , and detectors d1,d2 is given by the following projection of our wave function onto the fock vacuum space @xmath59\\varepsilon    @xmath60\\bigr\\}$ ] , @xmath61 $ ] , and @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding probability of detecting the photons by detectors d1,d2 is thus @xmath63 where @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the spacing of the intereference fringes @xcite .",
    "@xmath68 can be changed by moving the detectors transversely to the incident beams .    to make the formula more transparent , without loss of generality , in the following we shall consider 50:50 beam splitter : @xmath69 and three characteristic locations of the detectors",
    "so as to have @xmath70    let us first consider the case @xmath71 for which the above probability reads @xmath72 we see that the probability unexpectedly factorizes left  right and not up  down as one would be tempted to conjecture from the initial up  down independence expressed by the product of the `` upper '' and `` lower '' function in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2-state ] ) .    on the other hand , the incoming polarizations influence the coincidence counting even when we remove the polarizers p1 and p2 .",
    "then , provided the right photons arrive at the beam splitter within a sufficiently short time and are separately detected by d1 and d2 , we obtain @xmath73    this equation clarifies the minimum of the coincidence rates obtained for the @xmath74 positions of detectors in refs .",

    "we have therefore shown that the 4th order interference interaction between beam splitter and two incoming photons imposes polarization correlation on the emerging photons no matter whether they arrive at the beam splitter polarized or unpolarized .",

    "( [ eq : bang ] ) and ( [ eq : emerge ] ) ] that for an appropriate position of the beam splitter incoming unpolarized photons always emerge perpendicularly polarized in particular directions .",
    "more specifically , they appear prepared in a genuine singlet state and enable conceiving a novel experiment in which we can preselect spin correlated photons from completely unpolarized independent photons which nowhere interacted without in any way affecting them @xcite .",
    "when polarized photons arrive at a beam splitter and the 4th order interference takes place , one can use the modulation of the polarizations in order to determine the coincidence counting even when no outgoing polarization is being measured .",
    "in particular we have shown [ eq .  ( [ eq : bingo ] ) ] that in predetermined directions incoming parallelly polarized photons never emerge on two different sides of the beam splitter .",
    "it is also interesting that the probability of detecting both photons together on one side of the beam splitter ( by one detector ) is structurally different from the the probability of finding them on both sides .",
