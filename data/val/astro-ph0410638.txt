    "within the volume occupied by a star cluster ( sc ) , the energy injected by stellar winds and supernova explosions is fully thermalized via random interactions .",
    "this generates the large central overpressure that continuously accelerates the ejected gas and eventually blows it out of the star cluster volume to compose a superwind . in the adiabatic solution of chevalier & clegg ( 1985 ; hereafter referred to as cc85 ; see also canto , et al .",
    "2000 and raga et al .",
    "2001 ) temperature and density present almost homogeneous values within the central volume , whereas the expansion velocity grows almost linearly from 0 km s@xmath0 at the center , to the sound speed ( @xmath1 ) at the cluster radius @xmath2 .",
    "there is then a rapid evolution as matter streams away from the star cluster and the wind parameters ( velocity , density , temperature and pressure ) soon approach their asymptotic values : @xmath3 @xmath4 , @xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath7 @xmath8 and thus @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are energy and mass deposition rates .",
    "recent results on the outflows expected from scs have led us to realize that the adiabatic steady wind solution proposed by cc85 and followers , becomes inapplicable in the case of massive and concentrated clusters .",
    "radiative cooling strongly modifies first the temperature distribution predicted for adiabatic stationary winds ( @xmath12 ) bringing suddenly and within a small radius , the temperature down to 10@xmath13 k , restricting then the x - ray emissivity of the winds to a volume much smaller than previously thought ( see silich et al . 2003 and 2004 ; hereafter referred to as papers i and ii ) .",
    "also , as shown in paper ii , for more energetic clusters , strong radiative cooling promotes the sudden leakage of thermal energy right within the star cluster volume itself , and for the cases in which the radiative losses there exceed 30@xmath14 of the stellar energy deposition rate , when cooling becomes catastrophic , then the stationary superwind solution is totally inhibited . in this latter case ,",
    "the rapid drop in temperature within the sc volume , leads to a sudden drop in central pressure and particularly to a sudden drop in sound speed .",
    "this inhibits the fast acceleration predicted in the adiabatic solution as required by the flow to reach its adiabatic terminal speed ( @xmath15 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the sudden drop in sound speed upsets also the balance , demanded by the stationary solution , between the stellar mass input rate and the rate at which matter can flow away from the cluster , ie : @xmath16 , and this inevitably leads to mass accumulation .    here",
    "we show how the metallicity attained by the ejected matter from a coeval cluster , strongly affects the limits found in paper ii bringing the energy input rate further down to much smaller values and thus affecting even lower mass clusters .",
    "we also show how after the thermal stationary superwinds are inhibited , and after an inevitably short phase of matter accumulation within the sc volume , a second stationary solution can be found .",
    "this is only possible while the stellar uv flux ionizes the deposited matter to compose a dense supernebula with an isothermal ( @xmath17 k ) , slow ( @xmath18 km s@xmath0 ) , stationary wind ( see section 2 ) .",
    "finally , as the evolution continues and the stars producing the uv photon output evolve into supernovae , a third quasi - adiabatic stationary stage could become possible after a second phase of matter accumulation within the star cluster radius .",
    "this could in principle evolve into a massive , cold , neutral outflow , however , its maximum velocity is well below the escape speed and thus the ejected matter , unable to escape the gravitational potential of the star cluster , will sooner or latter recolapse to cause a second major burst of star formation .",
    "our conclusions and the observational properties of the various evolutionary phases are given in section 3 .",
    "superstar clusters recently found by the hubble space telescope in a large variety of starburst galaxies ( for a review see ho 1997 and the recent proceedings from `` the formation and evolution of massive young star clusters '' , eds",
    ". lamers et al , 2004 ) present a typical half - light radius @xmath19 3 - 10 pc , and masses that range from several times @xmath20 m@xmath21 to several times 10@xmath22 m@xmath21 ( see walcher et al .",
    "these are now believed to be the unit of violent star formation in starburst galaxies .",
    "the theoretical properties of massive bursts of star formation strongly depend on the assumed stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "synthesis models ( e.g. leitherer & heckman 1995 , leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) assume further a stellar imf and an upper and lower mass limit for the star formation event . in this way",
    "one knows that a coeval burst of 10@xmath23 m@xmath21 with a salpeter imf , and stars between 100 m@xmath21 and 1 m@xmath21 , would produce , through winds and supernovae ( sne ) , an almost constant mechanical energy input rate of @xmath24 erg s@xmath0 for almost 50 myr , until the last star of 8 m@xmath21 explodes as supernova . at the same time , the flux of ionizing radiation is to remain constant at @xmath25 photons s@xmath0 for the first 3 myr , to then steadily fall off approximately as @xmath26 .",
    "the above implies that the hii region phase will last for about 10 myr , time during which the cluster photon flux will have decrease by more than two and a half orders of magnitude with respect to its initial value .",
    "the above values scale linearly , throughout the evolution , with the mass of the assumed cluster and thus the hii region phase is in all coeval cases four to five times shorter than the supernova phase .",
    "when dealing with the outflows generated by star clusters , another important intrinsic property is the metallicity of their ejected matter .",
    "this is a strongly varying function of time , bound by the yields from massive stars and their evolution time .",
    "thus , once the cluster imf and the stellar mass limits are defined , the resultant metallicity is an invariant curve , independent of the cluster mass .",
    "here we consider coeval clusters with a salpeter imf , and stars between 100 m@xmath21 and 1 m@xmath21 , as well as the evolutionary tracks with rotation of meynet & maeder ( 2002 ) and an instantaneous mixing of the recently processed metals with the stellar envelopes of the progenitors ( see silich et al .",
    "2001 and tenorio - tagle et al .",
    "2003 , for an explicit description of the calculations ) .",
    "this leads to metallicity values ( using oxygen as tracer ) that rapidly reaches 14 z@xmath21 ( see figure 1 ) , and although steadily decaying afterwards , the metallicity remains above solar values for a good deal of the evolution ( for more than 20 myr ) , to then fall to the original metallicity of the parental cloud .",
    "one of the main effects of an enhanced metallicity of the ejecta is to boost its radiative cooling and in such a case , massive clusters may inevitably enter into the catastrophic cooling regime , envisaged in paper ii , to then find their stationary superwinds totally inhibited .",
    "relevant also is to note that at the end of the sn phase , the mass reinserted into the interstellar medium through winds and sne amounts to about 40@xmath14 of the original mass in stars ( see leitherer & heckman 1995 , their figure 53 ) . here",
    "we address the fate of such a vast amount of high metallicity matter .",
    "figure 2 shows results from our self - consistent radiative code ( see paper ii ) indicating the limiting energy , as a function of the size of the clusters , at which radiative cooling becomes catastrophic for matter with metallicities similar to those expected for the gas emanating from massive stellar clusters . as pointed out in paper",
    "ii there are three different kinds of solutions : low energy input rates , produced by low - mass clusters , appear far from the threshold line that separates the catastrophic cooling regime from the stationary superwinds , and thus are to generate stationary quasi - adiabatic winds similar to those proposed by cc85 .",
    "more energetic ( or more massive clusters ) , as their energy input rate approaches the threshold line will produce strongly radiative stationary superwinds with considerably smaller x - ray emitting volumes . finally , cases that lie above the threshold line in the catastrophic cooling zone , will radiate a large fraction of the energy input rate within the star cluster volume and thus will be unable to generate a stationary superwind .",
    "figure 3 incorporates the run of the metallicity of the matter injected by winds and sne as a function of time ( figure 1 ) to the results from our self - consistent radiative solution ( figure 2 ) and plots the resultant location of the threshold line for clusters with a @xmath27 = 3 pc ( solid line ) and 10 pc ( dashed line ) , the typical range of sizes of superstar clusters , as a function of time . as mentioned above",
    ", clusters of any given mass will evolve at an almost constant mechanical luminosity , crossing the diagram from left to right ( as the @xmath28 m@xmath21 cluster shown in the figure as a solid arrow ) .",
    "the figure confirms that low mass clusters will produce quasi - adiabatic stationary winds .",
    "however , clusters with a mass in the range 3 @xmath29 m@xmath21 to 3 @xmath30 m@xmath21 would cross twice the threshold line during their evolution and thus will have their thermal stationary winds fully inhibited for a good fraction of their evolution .",
    "more massive and compact clusters , those injecting more than say , 10@xmath31 erg s@xmath0 ( see figure 3 ) , will be unable to develop the superwind outflows during their evolution .    all of the latter clusters , unable to rid themselves from the continuous input of matter from their stellar sources , are to cause a rapid accumulation of the cold ( @xmath17 k ) recombined ejecta , now suddenly exposed to the uv photon flux from the most massive stars .",
    "as shown below , this leads to a dense and compact , high metallicity supernebula , able to establish an isothermal stationary hii region wind .      for clusters that enter the catastrophic cooling regime , matter accumulation within the star cluster volume ,",
    "would rapidly lead to larger densities , while the stellar uv photon flux independently will sustain the temperature at @xmath17 by photoionization .",
    "the density @xmath32 will increase until the stationary condition @xmath33 @xmath34 ( where now @xmath35 @xmath36 km s@xmath0 ) is once again fulfilled .",
    "given the drastic drop in temperature of the ejecta that results from thermalization followed by catastrophic cooling ( say from 10@xmath22 k to 10@xmath13 k ) , the density @xmath32 will have to increase by one and a half orders of magnitude to compensate the drop in sound speed ( @xmath37 ) and then meet the isothermal stationary condition .",
    "mass accumulation will last for a short time ( @xmath38 ) @xmath39 once this happens , an isothermal , stationary , photoionized wind will begin to emanate from the star cluster surface .",
    "the isothermal steady state flow equations within the star cluster radius ( @xmath40 ) are @xmath41 & &   \\rho_w = \\frac{q_m r}{3 u_w } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and outside of the star cluster ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 & &   \\rho_w = \\frac{{\\dot m}_{sc}}{4 \\pi u_w r^2 } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the mass deposition rate per unit volume inside a star cluster , @xmath45 is the isothermal sound speed , @xmath46 is the mean mass per particle , @xmath47 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath48 is the ratio of the specific heats .",
    "the wind central temperature is supported by photoionization at a @xmath49  k level , and the wind central density can be found by iterations from the condition that the isothermal sonic point @xmath50 acquires its proper position at the star cluster surface , @xmath51 ( for more details see paper ii ) .",
    "the isothermal wind temperature , density and velocity distributions are presented in figure 4a - c ( dashed lines ) .    the resultant core / halo supernebula density distribution ( see figure 4 ) can be approximated by a constant value @xmath52 within @xmath27 and by a power law ( @xmath6 ) for @xmath53 . in this case , the number of recombinations per unit time throughout the supernebula volume is : @xmath54 & & \\nonumber     \\left .",
    "\\int_{r_{sc}}^{r_{st } } n^2(r ) r^2 { { \\rm d}}r \\right ] =        \\\\[0.2 cm ] & &       \\frac{16 \\pi}{3 } \\beta n^2_c r_{sc}^3 \\left[1 - \\frac{3}{4 }       \\frac{r_{sc}}{r_{st}}\\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the str@xmath56mgren radius and @xmath57 is the recombination coefficient to all but the ground level .",
    "the str@xmath56mgren radius is then : @xmath58 equation ( [ eq.4 ] ) implies that the supernebula should be completely ionized by the star cluster uv radiation if the number of photons per unit time exceeds the critical value @xmath59 the bright , centrally concentrated high metallicity nebula and its moderate wind , causing a stationary core / halo structure , are to be maintained for as long as they remain fully ionized .",
    "note however that as the flux of uv photons from an instantaneous , or coeval , burst of star formation declines drastically after @xmath60  myr ( see leitherer & heckman 1995 ) it would eventually fall below the critical value .",
    "the continuously reduced number of ionizing photons , unable to balance the large number of recombinations in the ionized volume , forces the ionization front to recede supersonically towards the stars ( see beltrametti et al .",
    "1981 ) . from equation ( [ eq.4 ] )",
    "one can show that it will reach @xmath27 when the number of ionizing photons drops by a factor of four below the critical value . at this time",
    "the central hii region will begin to loose its identity and uniform structure , to evolve finally into a collection of individual ultracompact hii regions around the most massive members left within the coeval star cluster .",
    "taking into account that the supernebula central density @xmath61 and that the star cluster mechanical luminosity @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the adiabatic wind terminal speed in the hypothetical absence of radiative cooling , one can rewrite equation ( [ eq.5 ] ) in the form : @xmath64 & &   \\frac{\\beta \\dot m_{sc}^2}{3 \\pi \\mu_a^2 r_{sc } c_{hii}^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the mean mass per atom ( @xmath66 ) and the supernebula isothermal sound speed @xmath67 km s@xmath0 . in such a case ,",
    "our standard @xmath28 , @xmath68  pc cluster and its supernebula will require of an @xmath69  s@xmath0 .",
    "this value is almost an order of magnitude below the maximum number of uv photons emitted initially by our example 10@xmath23 m@xmath21 star cluster .",
    "the uv flux from the aging cluster would however reach the critical value after 4 myr and 5 myr , depending if one assumes solar or 0.1 solar as the original cluster metallicity ( see leitherer & heckman , 1995 ; their figure 37 ) , and the uv radiation a couple of myr after this will not suffice to sustain even the star cluster volume fully ionized .",
    "this brings the supernebula phase to an end , while restricting the ionized volume to ultracompact hii regions around the most massive sources left in the cluster . without the sufficient uv photons to maintain the sc volume fully ionized and at a temperature @xmath70 k , the stationary isothermal wind condition is inhibited and a new phase of matter accumulation will start .",
    "figure 5 displays the h@xmath71 luminosity of our 10@xmath23 m@xmath21 cluster that injects 3 @xmath72 erg s@xmath0 within a @xmath73 3 pc and thus initially , while the metallicity remains below z@xmath21 , it produces a strongly radiative stationary superwind ( follow the horizontal line in figure 3 ) .",
    "the stationary strongly radiative solution leads to a temperature @xmath74 k at a distance of 17.5 pc and thus at this radius the streaming wind matter recombines and is exposed to the stellar uv photon output .",
    "photoionization causes in such a case , a thin stationary shell with the matter that continuously streams with large speeds ( @xmath75 km s@xmath0 ) across the recombining radius and leads thus to a top - hat line profile ( rodrguez - gonzlez et al . 2004 ; owocki & cohen , 2001 ; dessart & owocki , 2002 ) shown by dotted line in figure 5 .",
    "this is very different to the calculated gaussian line profile produced during the supernebular phase , which displays a linewidth of the order of 100 km s@xmath0 ( fwzi ) and , given the large densities , has an intensity several orders of magnitude larger than that of the top - hat line profile produced during the initial superwind stage .",
    "the total integrated intensity over the line profiles is : 5.3 @xmath72 erg s@xmath0 for the supernebula stage and 6.9 @xmath76 erg s@xmath0 for the strongly radiative superwind .",
    "the lack of sufficient uv photons to keep the supernebula phase at work , inevitably leads to a further accumulation of the ejected matter within the star cluster volume , until the density there raises by another order of magnitude and compensates in this way the drop in temperature ( say , from 10@xmath13 k to 100 k ) and a stationary flow can once again be established .",
    "this time however , the quasi - adiabatic flow is very massive and very slow ( @xmath77 2 km s@xmath78 ) .",
    "figure 4 a - c ( solid lines ) display the properties ( the run of temperature , density and velocity as a function of distance to the star cluster center ) of such stationary flow .",
    "figure 4 compares the isothermal ( @xmath17 k ) high metallicity supernebula outflow with the late massive adiabatic neutral flow . in both cases",
    "the density drops as @xmath6 and thanks to the continuous energy input rate through photoionization the supernebula is able to expand with increasingly larger velocities ( up to 50 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "the adiabatic dense outflow case reaches instead a maximum outflow velocity of only @xmath79 2 km s@xmath0 .",
    "this maximum speed is well below the escape speed ( @xmath80 ) from the central cluster and thus is to evolve instead into another phase of matter accumulation , to eventually recolapse into a new generation of stars ; subject of a forthcoming communication .",
    "contrary to the predictions from the adiabatic solution of chevalier & clegg 1985 , we have shown here that massive and concentrated star clusters do not necessarily blow a strong stationary superwind throughout their evolution .",
    "the high metallicity of the matter deposited through winds and supernovae , enhances radiative cooling within the star cluster volume , and leads instead to two other possible types of stationary flows emanating from massive sc .",
    "these have been termed here supernebula and massive slow neutral outflows .",
    "the high metallicity supernebulae with a distinct core / halo density distribution , expanding with up to 50 km s@xmath0 , can only be maintained in presence of an ample supply of stellar uv photons .",
    "these should be able to keep , at least , the central sc volume fully ionized .",
    "we have shown that this phase is thus bound to the first 10 myr of the cluster evolution .",
    "on the other hand , the slow massive neutral flows , that follow the supernebula phase , are to last in the case of very massive clusters ( m@xmath81 @xmath82 m@xmath21 ) , until the end of the supernova phase ( @xmath19 40 - 50 myr ) .",
    "the maximum speed of the neutral outflows is however much slower than the escape speed from the massive clusters and thus are to be inhibited by the potential of the clusters , leading instead to a further accumulation of matter which may eventually collapse and lead to a new stellar generation .",
    "very massive clusters , above the threshold line , will enter from the start of their evolution the supernebula phase , and will never cause a superwind . on the other hand , lower mass clusters will never experience either the supernebula nor the massive neutral stationary outflows and will establish stationary quasi - adiabatic superwinds throughout their evolution .",
    "note however , that coeval clusters with a mass in the range 3 @xmath29 m@xmath21 to 3 @xmath30 m@xmath21 and a @xmath27 = 3 pc ( see figure 3 ) will start their evolution causing the development of a stationary strongly radiative superwind , to then enter into the supernebulae phase and finally , after 8 - 20 myr , respectively , re - enter once again into the stationary strongly radiative superwind regime .",
    "clearly , this will lead to a very strong interaction between the new superwind and the matter left near the cluster during the supernebula or the massive and slow neutral outflow phases .",
    "all superstar clusters will be , throughout their evolution , strong x - ray emitting sources .",
    "clusters below the threshold line , that separates stationary superwinds and catastrophic cooling solutions ( see figure 3 ) , are to emit copiously in x - rays both within the sc central volume and in their winds .",
    "clusters above the threshold line , whether experiencing the supernebula or the massive slow neutral outflow , will also emit in x - rays within their central volume , as catastrophic cooling radiates away the continuously replenished thermal energy .",
    "the x - ray properties of such clusters , compared to the x - ray emission from superbubbles will be the subject of a forthcoming communication .",
    "our gratitude to leticia carigi for her suggestions regarding the metallicity of the ejected matter .",
    "we thank our anonymous referee for his comments and suggestions .",
