    "clumping of the core - helium - burning stars to the red end of the metal - rich counterpart to the horizontal branch is one of the outstanding features in the colour - magnitude diagrams of globular and open clusters @xcite .",
    "hence , these giant stars are called the red clump ( rc ) stars or clump giants .",
    "moreover , the rc stars occupy a very small region in the colour - magnitude diagram of the stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "absolute magnitudes of the rc stars lie between @xmath7 and @xmath8 mag for the stars of spectral types g8 iii to k2 iii , respectively @xcite .",
    "these features of the rc stars make them suitable standard candles for distance estimation of stellar clusters and nearby galaxies for which the rc stars are resolved @xcite .",
    "moreover , the rc stars are one of the most reliable distance indicators due to the fact that their absolute magnitude calibrations are precisely tied to the _ hipparcos _ distance scale @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) near - infrared data for a sample of 24 open clusters in order to investigate how the @xmath9-band absolute magnitude of the rc stars depends on age and metallicity .",
    "they showed that a constant value of @xmath10 mag is a reasonable assumption to use in distance determinations of clusters with metallicities of @xmath11\\leq 0.4 $ ] dex and ages of @xmath12 gyr .",
    "this absolute magnitude value was also confirmed by @xcite who found @xmath13 mag using the newly reduced _",
    "trigonometric data @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite showed that the absolute magnitudes of rc stars depend on two - colour indices defined in the johnson - cousins ( @xmath14 ) , 2mass ( @xmath15 ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xmath16 ) photometries .",
    "although it is possible to define mean colours and absolute magnitudes for the rc stars in different photometric bands and the mean values have been suggested in some studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is well known that the rc stars occupy certain ranges of colours and absolute magnitudes in the colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "thus , absolute magnitudes of the rc stars depend on the metallicity and colours especially in optical bands , although it is found that the metallicity dependence is weak @xcite .",
    "the mean @xmath17 and @xmath18 magnitudes of the rc stars can be considerably affected by stellar population differences .",
    "@xcite found a weak dependence of the @xmath18-band absolute magnitude of the rc stars in the solar neighbourhood on @xmath2 $ ] at the level of @xmath19 mag dex@xmath20 and suggested an absolute magnitude correction of 0.07 mag in the @xmath18-band for large magellanic cloud . using the models of @xcite",
    ", @xcite predicted mean rc absolute magnitudes in @xmath17 and @xmath18 bands for a large range of ages and metallicities .",
    "their models clearly showed that the absolute magnitudes of the rc stars in @xmath18-band depends both on metallicity and age , so that the metallicity dependence must be taken into account in the absolute magnitude calculations of the rc stars @xcite .",
    "thus , instead of a general mean for the absolute magnitude , an absolute magnitude calibration including at least one colour and metallicity should be used in the distance estimation of the rc stars . as more and more distant objects",
    "are observed in the sky surveys , metallicity - dependent uncertainties in the absolute magnitude determinations of the rc stars increase the error levels in the estimation of distances and physical parameters of the objects including these stars , such as stellar clusters .",
    "aim of this study is to derive an @xmath0 absolute magnitude calibration including the @xmath1 colour and @xmath2 $ ] metallicity using the rc stars in the globular and open clusters with a wide range of metallicities . in the next section",
    "we describe how the data for the rc stars were collected from the literature .",
    "in the section 3 , we derive an absolute magnitude calibration for the rc stars and compare the distances of the rc stars derived from our calibration formula with those obtained from the _ hipparcos _ trigonometric data and spectrophotometric data . finally , we conclude and discuss the results in the section 4 .",
    "the data in this study were collected from the colour - magnitude diagrams of the globular and open clusters in our galaxy .",
    "the data for globular clusters were taken from @xcite who analysed _ hubble space telescope",
    "_ observations .",
    "@xcite examined 74 globular clusters in _",
    "f439w _ and _ f555w _ bands and analysed their colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "they transformed the original magnitudes to @xmath21 photometry using calibrations given in their study .",
    "it is clearly seen that 25 of these globular clusters show remarkable clumping in the rc region in their colour - magnitude diagrams ( see fig . 4 in * ? ? ?",
    "borders of the rc regions were determined by eye inspection of the colour - magnitude diagrams of globular clusters .",
    "distance moduli , colour excesses and metallicities of the globular clusters were primarily taken from @xcite . in cases where newer measurements exist",
    ", we used the new ones .",
    "the galactic coordinates ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , distance moduli @xmath24 , colour excesses @xmath25 and metallicities @xmath2 $ ] for the globular clusters are listed in table 1 .",
    "@xmath1 colours and @xmath17 magnitudes of the rc stars were de - reddened and their @xmath0 absolute magnitudes were calculated using distance moduli given in table 1 .",
    "frequency distributions of the de - reddened colours @xmath26 and absolute magnitudes @xmath0 of the rc stars in each globular cluster were estimated and central positions of the peaks in the distributions obtained for each globular cluster were found by fitting gaussian functions . @xmath27 colour - magnitude diagrams and frequency distributions of the @xmath26 colours and @xmath0 absolute magnitudes of the globular clusters listed in table 1 are shown in fig .",
    "central positions of the peaks and standard deviations for the @xmath26 , @xmath0 absolute magnitude distributions and the number of rc stars in 25 globular clusters in our sample are given in table 1 .",
    "as the aim of this study is to derive a colour ( @xmath1 ) and metallicity ( @xmath2 $ ] ) dependent absolute magnitude ( @xmath0 ) calibration of the rc stars , metallicity range of the sample must be as large as possible .",
    "metallicity range of the globular clusters in our sample is @xmath5<-0.30 $ ] dex . in order to extend this metallicity range , the rc stars in the open clusters",
    "must be included in our sample .",
    "however , in general there are a few rc stars in open clusters . in this study , we selected the open clusters , where the rc stars prominently detectable in their colour - magnitude diagrams , from the studies by @xcite .",
    "we listed their colour excesses , distance moduli and metallicities of these open clusters in table 1 .",
    "we determined borders of the rc region by eye inspection of the colour - magnitude diagrams of open clusters .",
    "as the number of rc stars is small , we simply calculated the average @xmath26 colour indices and @xmath0 absolute magnitudes of these stars ( see table 1 ) . by including the selected open clusters in the sample , upper limit of the metallicities",
    "were extended to about + 0.40 dex .",
    "the selected open clusters increased the total number of the clusters in the sample to 31 ( table 1 ) .",
    "as the metallicities were collected from the literature that includes continually changing average of parameters , the metallicity scale used in our study should be carefully taken into account .",
    "one of the most important metallicity scales was given by ( zw , * ? ? ?",
    "they used photometric indices of clusters calibrated primarily by cohen s ( @xcite ) spectroscopic data . as the distance moduli ,",
    "colour excesses and metallicities for 18 of 25 globular clusters in table 1 were taken from @xcite and the 2010 version of the harris catalog @xcite whose metallicity scales fit to zw metallicity scale , we conclude that the metallicities in our globular cluster data fit to this scale , in general .",
    "we also checked for the metallicity scale of the remaining seven globular clusters in table 1 that were not taken from the harris catalog @xcite and found that these metallicities are in a good agreement with the zw scale .",
    "dependence of the mean @xmath0 absolute magnitude of the rc stars in the sample clusters both on @xmath2 $ ] metallicity and @xmath26 colour are presented in fig .",
    "it is clearly seen that the rc stars in our study comprise a considerably wide range of @xmath26 colours , @xmath28 mag .",
    "metallicity of the clusters covers a wide range as well , @xmath5<+0.40 $ ] dex .",
    "@xmath0 absolute magnitudes of the rc stars in our sample range from 0.43 to 1.03 mag .",
    "metal - poor halo clusters are found in the bluer @xmath26 colours in fig . 2 while metal - rich bulge clusters are redder ( @xmath29 mag ) . in our sample ,",
    "@xmath1 colours of open clusters in the thin disc are larger than 0.9 mag .",
    "there is a linear relation with a slope of 2.97 dex mag@xmath20 between the @xmath2 $ ] metallicity and @xmath0 absolute magnitude of the rc stars in fig .",
    "2a . the scatter in this relation ( @xmath300.1 mag ) is larger than the scatter ( @xmath300.04 mag ) in the relation between the @xmath31 absolute magnitude and @xmath26 colour of the rc stars .",
    "2c shows the linear relation between the @xmath26 colour indices and @xmath2 $ ] metallicities for the clusters in our sample .",
    "slope of the relation is 2.44 dex mag@xmath20 .",
    "2a - c demonstrate that the population effects on the absolute magnitudes and colour indices of the rc stars can not be negligible in the galactic scales .",
    "from the considerations above , it is clear that the @xmath0 absolute magnitude of the rc stars is well correlated both with the @xmath2 $ ] metallicity and @xmath26 colour .",
    "thus , a regression analysis based on 31 clusters in table 1 gives the following relation :    @xmath32 + 0.262(\\pm 0.111).\\ ] ]    numbers in parenthesis are standard errors of the coefficients .",
    "the correlation coefficient and standard deviation of the calibration are @xmath33 and @xmath34 mag , respectively .",
    "t - scores of the variables @xmath26 , @xmath2 $ ] and the constant in eq . 1 are 6.01 ( @xmath35 ) , 1.06 ( @xmath36 ) and 2.35 ( @xmath37 ) , respectively , with a degree of freedom of 29 .",
    "this equation is reliable and valid in the ranges @xmath4 mag , @xmath5<+0.40 $ ] dex and @xmath38 mag .",
    "a comparison of the absolute magnitudes calculated from the calibration with the original absolute magnitudes in table 1 is shown in fig .",
    "this figure demonstrates that 22 of the clusters ( @xmath30 71@xmath39 ) are within 1@xmath40 deviation .",
    "there is no any systematical tendency in the lower panel of fig .",
    "3 that shows residuals from the calibration equation .",
    "t - score analysis shows that metallicity dependence of the calibration is relatively weak , while the dependence on the colour @xmath26 is strong .",
    "if the metallicity is not taken into account , the absolute magnitude changes @xmath300.1 mag for the stars with lowest and highest metallicities .",
    "it should be also noted that the absolute magnitude decreases with decreasing metallicity ( see fig .",
    "that is why we emphasize that the metallicity , if it is known , should be taken into account in the absolute magnitude calibrations of the rc stars .",
    "although the metallicity dependence of the eq .",
    "1 is found weak , we suggest that absolute magnitude estimation errors related with the metallicity will be more important for the distant rc stars .      using the absolute magnitude calibration in this study , @xmath0 absolute magnitudes were estimated for the rc stars collected from two studies , i.e. @xcite and @xcite . the rc stars with @xmath2 $ ] metallicities are listed in @xcite who collected metallicities from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they observed 226 rc stars in the near - infrared @xmath41-bands in the solar neighbourhood and calculated mean absolute magnitudes of the rc stars using _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite . in our study ,",
    "@xmath1 colours were taken from newly reduced _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite , parallaxes and @xmath2 $ ] metallicities from @xcite who collected @xmath2 $ ] metallicities of only 101 rc stars from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 $ ] metallicities of these stars are between -0.6 and 0.4 dex .",
    "as @xcite scaled the metallicities taken from @xcite according to the ones from @xcite , it can be concluded that the metallicities in laney s study are in the same scale and self - consistent .",
    "we first de - reddened the b - v colour indices using the @xmath25 colour - excesses evaluated for the 101 program stars using the maps of @xcite , and this was reduced to a value corresponding to the distance of the star by means of the equations of @xcite . for a detailed explanation of the de - reddening procedure , see @xcite .",
    "the reduced @xmath25 colour - excesses of the program stars are between 0.001 and 0.081 mag with a median value of 0.010 mag .",
    "we calculated @xmath0 absolute magnitudes of these 101 rc stars using the absolute magnitude calibration derived in this study .",
    "we estimated distances putting our calibration results into the pogson equation .",
    "4 shows the comparison of distances from our calibration with those taken from @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite selected the distances of the rc stars in their study from _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite .",
    "the distances calculated from our calibration are in very well agreement with those taken from _ hipparcos _",
    "catalogue @xcite . the mean and standard deviation of the residuals",
    "are only -3.5 and 6.2 pc , respectively .",
    "a considerable part of the sample is in 1@xmath40 limits in fig .",
    "this comparison demonstrates that the distances based on the @xmath0 absolute magnitude calibration of the rc stars in the stellar clusters are as precise as comparable to the distances derived from _ hipparcos _",
    "parallaxes of the rc stars within 150 pc .",
    "we also compared the distances estimated via our calibration with those obtained by a spectrophotometric method .",
    "@xcite calculated spectrophotometric distances of 305 faint and high galactic latitude rc stars by deriving their atmospheric parameters from high signal - to - noise middle resolution spectra .",
    "we removed 54 of 305 stars from the sample as they are out of the validity limits of the absolute magnitude calibration in this study , reducing the number of stars to 251 .",
    "while the @xmath2 $ ] metallicities and @xmath42 total absorptions were taken from @xcite , @xmath17 apparent magnitudes and @xmath1 colours from _ hipparcos _ catalogue @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 $ ] metallicities are between -0.54 and 0.42 dex .",
    "since the metallicities were found by @xcite , we conclude that the metallicities in this study are in the same scale and self - consistent .    after apparent magnitudes and colours were de - reddened , absolute magnitudes and distances of 251 rc stars listed in @xcite were estimated using the absolute magnitude calibration derived in this study . in fig . 5",
    ", we compared the distances of the rc stars estimated using our absolute magnitude calibration with the spectrophotometric distances taken from @xcite in which the rc stars lie between 200 and 500 pc from the sun .",
    "note that the distances taken from @xcite are smaller than 150 pc .",
    "5 demonstrates that the distances obtained from two different methods are very well correlated with a scatter of @xmath43 pc .",
    "as the mean distance difference is only @xmath44 pc ( see fig .",
    "5b ) , we conclude that there is no any systematic difference between these distances .",
    "we derived an @xmath0 absolute magnitude calibration in terms of the @xmath1 colour and @xmath2 $ ] metallicity using the rc stars in the globular and open clusters with a wide range of metallicities .",
    "the comparisons of the distances estimated from the calibration equation in this study both with the distances obtained from trigonometric parallaxes and spectrophotometric analysis indicate that the calibration formula gives very reliable absolute magnitudes for the estimation of distances for the rc stars up to 500 pc .",
    "we conclude in this study that , instead of using a unique absolute magnitude for all the rc stars , an absolute magnitude calibration in the optical bands based on at least one colour and metallicity should be used in the precise distance estimates .",
    "taking into account the metallicity in the calculation of absolute magnitudes of the rc stars can be important in the shallow / deep photometric and spectroscopic surveys , such as the radial velocity experiment ( rave ) and sdss , and in the distance calculations of the stellar clusters or field rc stars . with the help of the absolute magnitude calibration derived in this study , and with the uncertainties in the metallicity dependence of the cepheid period - luminosity relation @xcite , the rc stars can serve as standard candles for the distance calculations of nearby galaxies , as well .",
