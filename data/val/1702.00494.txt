    ", we study frequency modulated ( fm ) spectroscopy as a low noise and , in principle , compact way to read - out the probe laser signal of the eit system that carries the information about the rf e - field .",
    "this study is important for pushing the sensitivity of the technique to the atomic projection noise limit by eliminating technical noise in the probe laser read - out and elucidating the role of probe laser shot noise .",

    "( b ) shows the probe transmission signal vs probe laser detuning for different rf e - field strengths .",
    "these measurements show the at regime .",
    "the measurements were carried out with amplitude modulation of the coupling laser beam similar to @xcite.,width=3 ]    at the heart of rydberg atom - based rf electrometry is the large transition dipole moment , @xmath12 , between two adjacent rydberg states , e.g. 100 to 10000 times the alkali d@xmath13 transition @xcite , which allows one to detect absolute rf e - fields with high sensitivity . when the rf e - field is at the level of mv@xmath10@xmath7 , autler - townes ( at ) splitting is generated in the eit spectrum by the rf e - field coupling between the rydberg states , fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] @xcite .",
    "the at splitting , @xmath14 , is proportional to the transition dipole moment between the rydberg states and the rf e - field amplitude , i.e. @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is planck s constant .",
    "the principle quantum number , @xmath17 , of the rydberg states can be changed to cover a broad frequency spectrum from ghz to thz , with varying sensitivity depending primarily on the transition dipole moments and collision rates .",
    "when the at splitting can not be observed due to the spectral resolution , the amplitude of the eit probe transmission can be used to determine the e - field @xcite .",
    "the latter measurement is more sensitive to noise because the probe transmission on resonance and/or the spectral lineshape must be accurately determined . to increase the sensitivity , two goals present themselves",
    "first , it is important to increase the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the measurement .",
    "second , it is advantageous to increase the spectral resolution to expand the at regime .",
    "this paper addresses the first goal using a method , fm spectroscopy , that can be integrated into a portable , compact package .",
    "the sensitivity of the rf e - field measurement is limited by three main factors from reaching the projection noise limit of the atomic sensor .",
    "these factors are : the technical noise of the probe laser , the residual doppler effect due to the wavelength mismatch of the eit probe and coupling lasers , and the photon shot noise of the probe laser on the photodetector .",
    "recently , we have utilized a homodyne detection technique with a mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) to suppress the technical noise of the probe laser @xcite .",
    "we achieved a new sensitivity limit for atom - based rf e - field sensing of @xmath18 which was determined to be photon shot noise limited .",
    "the mzi is experimentally more complicated than fm spectroscopy because it requires an additional frequency stabilized laser to control the phase of the interferometer .",
    "fm spectroscopy is an alternative , less complex method , that can reduce the technical noise of the probe laser so that photon shot noise limited performance can be realized @xcite .",
    "fm spectroscopy has been used for precision measurements such as gravitational wave detection interferometry @xcite , cavity - based laser frequency stabilization @xcite , and high - speed detection of weak absorption signals @xcite .",
    "this method has also been used to suppress light shifts in optical pumping systems @xcite . in order to achieve high sensitivity with fm spectroscopy residual amplitude modulation ( ram ) must be addressed .",
    "ram is caused by etalon effects , variations of the birefringence of the electro - optic modulator ( eom ) used for frequency modulation , fluctuations in the rf drive power , spatial variation of the field inside the eom crystal , etc that lead to unequal magnitude and/or unwanted phase shifts of the modulation sidebands .",

    "we actively stabilize the ram in our setup .",
    "our sensitivity using fm spectroscopy is also photon shot noise limited and virtually the same as that obtained with the mzi .",
    "these results support our work using the mzi and show that photon shot noise is a challenge for rydberg atom - based e - field measurements since it is difficult to increase the probe laser power without increasing collision rates and introducing unwanted amounts of power broadening .",

    "ram can be actively compensated by rotating the principal axes of the eom crystal by the application of an electric field in order to align the linear polarized probe laser with one of the principal axes of the crystal . by aligning the probe laser polarization with one of the principal axes of the crystal",
    ", the probe light propagates as if in a homogeneous material .",
    "a waveguide - based eom is advantageous because the applied voltages needed to produce the necessary optical phase shift are 2 orders of magnitude smaller and the input fiber acts as a spatial mode filter , which reduces the ram contributions arising from the spatial inhomogeneity of the optical field @xcite .",
    "we temperature stabilized the waveguide - based eom to reduce drift due to the temperature fluctuations .",
    "ram can be measured and actively reduced by determining the power falling on a fast photodiode at the modulation frequency and using that signal to correct the principal axes of the crystal using a feedback loop .",
    "the relative phase shift due to birefringence of the crystal is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the wave number of the probe light with wavelength @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the length of the crystal , and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the refractive index of the extraordinary ( ordinary ) wave .",
    "the phase shift can be externally controlled because @xmath34 and @xmath35 depend on the electric field present inside the crystal via the pockels effect .",

    "the correction phase needed to compensate the ram can be determined by the condition that all odd harmonics of @xmath38 of the laser power falling on a photodiode placed after the eom are zero for perfect phase modulation ( alignment of the probe electric field vector along one of the principal axes of the crystal ) . for odd harmonics of @xmath38 ,",

    "<S> rydberg atom - based electrometry enables traceable electric field measurements with high sensitivity over a large frequency range , from gigahertz to terahertz . </S>",
    "<S> such measurements are particularly useful for the calibration of radio frequency and terahertz devices , as well as other applications like near field imaging of electric fields . </S>",
    "<S> we utilize frequency modulated spectroscopy with active control of residual amplitude modulation to improve the signal to noise ratio of the optical readout of rydberg atom - based radio frequency electrometry . matched filtering of the signal is also implemented . </S>",
    "<S> although we have reached similarly , high sensitivity with other read - out methods , frequency modulated spectroscopy is advantageous because it is well - suited for building a compact , portable sensor . in the current experiment , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath03 @xmath1v @xmath2 hz@xmath3 sensitivity is achieved and is found to be photon shot noise limited . </S>"
