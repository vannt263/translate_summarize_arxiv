    "the study of collective flow in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been an intense field of research for the past twenty years ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the ultimate motivation for the whole endeavour has been the extraction of the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an early account and ref .",
    "@xcite for more recent ones ) .",
    "moreover , the study of highly complex ( quantum ) many - body dynamics of heavy - ion collisions is in itself a challenging task .",
    "the ( in - plane ) directed ( or sideward ) flow was predicted for semi - central heavy - ion collisions on the basis of fluid dynamical calculations @xcite and observed in experiments soon after @xcite .",
    "the study of the average in - plane transverse momentum , @xmath1 , as a function of rapidity , @xmath2 , provides an easy and intuitive way of quantizing the directed flow @xcite . for beam energy range up to a few gev per nucleon , the experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies of this phenomenon have provided important understanding of its features .",
    "experimentally , the dependences of directed flow on incident energy @xcite , centrality @xcite , particle type @xcite , system size @xcite and isospin @xcite have been determined .",
    "these main features have been quantitatively reproduced by microscopic transport models of either quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite or boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) @xcite type .",
    "despite all these efforts , a definite conclusion on the eos has not yet been achieved . as pointed out",
    "early on @xcite , the momentum dependent interactions ( mdi ) play a crucial role in the determination of the eos .",
    "the directed flow is influenced in addition by the ( in - medium ) nucleon - nucleon cross section ( @xmath3 ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , consistency is needed in deriving eos together with both mdi and @xmath3 @xcite . the importance to combine various observables ,",
    "each sensitive ( ideally ) to one particular aspect of the parameters that influence eos was emphasized recently @xcite .",
    "the results quoted above have been obtained from the analysis of integrated directed flow .",
    "the first analysis of differential directed flow ( ddf ) was introduced by pan and danielewicz @xcite , who studied the transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) dependence of the first order fourier coefficient , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the angle with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the ddf was studied around the balance energy ( @xmath7 , which is the energy of disappearance of flow @xcite ) by li and sustich @xcite , who unraveled its interesting patterns .",
    "they also pointed out the marked sensitivity of ddf to both eos and nucleon - nucleon cross section ( @xmath3 ) . at ags energies",
    "the ddf was studied both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "recently , we have completed the first experimental analysis of ddf for au+au collisions at incident energies from 90 to 400@xmath0  mev @xcite .",
    "we have found interesting patterns of the differential flow , evolving as a function of incident energy , particle type and rapidity .",
    "in particular , the study of high-@xmath4 particles is important because , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , they are good messengers from the high density state of the collision . the ddf could additionally provide snapshots of the flow development during the time of the collision .    in this paper",
    "we present new experimental data on directed flow in collisions of au+au , xe+csi and ni+ni .",
    "the complete coverage of the fopi detector makes possible precision studies of flow , refining our earlier studies done with phase i data @xcite .",
    "following our recent exploration of the energy range of 90 to 400@xmath0  mev for au+au @xcite , we focus here on the centrality ( for au+au ) and on system size dependence of directed flow .",
    "this analysis has been performed for the incident energies of 250 and 400 @xmath0  mev , for particles with @xmath8=1 and @xmath8=2 .",
    "to avoid overloading , only a selection of results is included in the body of the paper . in the appendix we provide additional figures to complete the data set . after describing the detector , the method of analysis , and the corrections applied to data , we study the centrality and system dependence of directed flow over the complete forward rapidity range , both in terms of ( @xmath4 ) integrated and in a differential way .",
    "all the features of the experimental data are then compared with iqmd model calculations for the incident energies of 90 and 400@xmath0  mev .",
    "the data have been measured with a wide phase - space coverage using the fopi detector @xcite at gsi darmstadt .",
    "the reaction products are identified by charge ( @xmath8 ) in the forward plastic wall ( pw ) at 1.2@xmath9  30@xmath10 using time - of - flight ( tof ) and specific energy loss . in the central drift chamber ( cdc ) , covering 34@xmath9  145@xmath10 , the particle identification is on mass ( mass number @xmath0 ) , obtained using magnetic rigidity and the energy loss .",
    "for pw the @xmath8 resolution is 0.13 charge units for @xmath8=1 and 0.14 for @xmath8=2 , while for cdc the mass resolution varies from 0.20 to 0.53 mass units for @xmath0=1 to @xmath0=4 .",
    "the contamination of @xmath8=1 in the @xmath8=2 sample varies from 6% to 10% ( from ni+ni at 250@xmath0  mev to au+au at 400@xmath0  mev ) for the pw and is up to 20% for the cdc ( where it is the contamination of @xmath0=1,2 and 3 in the @xmath0=4 sample ) .",
    "the pw measures the velocity of particles via tof with an average resolution of 150  ps . for the cdc ,",
    "the relative momentum resolution @xmath11 varies from 4% for @xmath12  0.5  gev / c to about 12% for @xmath13=2  gev / c . for more details on the detector configuration for this experiment see ref .",
    "@xcite .    the phase - space coverage of the fopi detector is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - x0 ] for particles with @xmath8=1 ( for pw ) and @xmath0=1,2,3 ( for cdc ) , measured in semi - central collisions au+au at incident energy of 250@xmath0  mev . to compare different incident energies and particle species , we use normalized center - of - mass ( c.m . ) transverse momentum ( per nucleon ) and rapidity , defined as @xmath14 where the subscript @xmath15 denotes the projectile . for the pw coverage ,",
    "shadows around @xmath16  7@xmath10 and  19@xmath10 are visible , arising from subdetector borders and frames .    for the centrality selection we used the charged particle multiplicities , classified into five bins , m1 to m5 .",
    "the variable @xmath17 ( the sums run over the transverse and longitudinal c.m .",
    "kinetic energy components of all the products detected in an event ) has been additionally used for a better selection of the most central collisions ( m5 centrality bin ) .",
    "the geometric impact parameters interval for the centrality bins m3 , m4 , and m5 for au+au system at 400@xmath0  mev studied here are presented in table  [ tab-1 ] .",
    ".the geometric impact parameters intervals @xmath18 and the correction factors for the reaction plane resolution , 1/@xmath19 , for three centrality bins of au+au collisions at the incident energy of 400@xmath0  mev . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab-5 ] we compare the experimental values of the average normalized transverse momentum with the values from iqmd , for hm and sm cases .",
    "particles with @xmath8=1 and @xmath8=2 for the two windows in rapidity studied in fig .",
    "[ fig - d2 ] are compared .",
    "the data values have a systematic error represented by the number in parenthesis as the error on the last digit .",
    "the model reproduces reasonably well the average transverse momenta for @xmath8=1 particles , while it underestimates them for @xmath8=2 , for both windows of rapidity .",
    "we mention that , recently , our experimental differential directed flow in au+au @xcite was nicely reproduced by a buu model wich includes an improved dirac - brueckner formalism @xcite . in this case , for the densities expected at 400@xmath0  mev , the eos is soft , which is in agreement to our results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - d3 ] we show the measured ddf for xe+csi and ni+ni systems at 400@xmath0  mev , m4 centrality , in comparison to iqmd results , for @xmath8=1 particles in two windows of rapidity . in case of xe+csi system the model calculations are at the same level of agreement with data as in case of au+au : the sm parametrization is reproducing the data , with clear deviations at high momenta . for the ni+ni case even the hm parametrization underpredicts the measured data .",
    "most notably , as obvious particularly for ni+ni , the mdi have effects predominantly at low @xmath4 , contrary to earlier buu predictions ( performed for the asymmetric system ar+pb ) @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - d2x ] we show the model comparison of the differential flow for particles weighted by @xmath8 for au+au collisions at incident energy of 400@xmath0  mev , m4 centrality , for two windows in rapidity . as in case of integrated values , as a result of different relative contribution of particles heavier than @xmath8=1 , the sensitivity to eos is reduced for this type of comparison .",
    "we have presented experimental results on directed flow in au+au , xe+csi and ni+ni collisions at incident energies from 90 to 400@xmath0  mev .",
    "general features of the directed flow have been investigated using experimental data , particularly the centrality and the system dependence .",
    "we have studied the rapidity dependence of the first fourier coefficient , @xmath20 , integrating over all transverse momentum range .",
    "a special emphasis has been put on the differential directed flow , namely the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath20 .",
    "while for integrated values we presented a new way of looking at old ( and generally known ) dependences , the ddf results are reported for the first time for our energy domain , both for the centrality and for the system size dependence .",
    "we have devoted special care to the corrections of the experimental data .",
    "the influence of the finite granularity of the detector has been studied and corrected for .",
    "the high accuracy of the final results is based as well on a good reaction plane resolution achieved with the full coverage of the fopi detector .",
    "we have compared the experimental data with iqmd transport model calculations , for both integral and differential @xmath20 values .",
    "this comparison , performed for all the three studied systems , shows a clear sensitivity of the directed flow on the eos parametrization in the model , especially in case of particle - selected comparison . in this case , for both integrated and differential directed flow at the incident energy of 400@xmath0  mev , we conclude that a soft eos with mdi is the only parametrization in the model that reproduces the data for au and xe systems",
    ". a clear discrepancy is seen for ni system , which needs to be addressed separately .",
    "it may reflect the increasing importance played by the nuclear surface for lighter systems .",
    "we consider our present results as a case study on the sensitivities in determination of eos and mdi from directed flow comparisons .",
    "we emphasized the necessity of the present kind of differential comparison prior to more global quantities .",
    "we have shown that the combination of rapidity and transverse momentum analysis of ( differential ) directed flow can impose constraints on the model .",
    "we also pointed out some difficulties of the model to reproduce the measured data concerning : i ) flow at low energy ( we considered here 90@xmath0  mev ) , ii ) flow as a function of system size , and iii ) fragment production .",
    "as a consequence , none of the iqmd parametrizations studied here is able to consistently explain the whole set of experimental data .",
    "the importance of spectators acting as clocks for the expansion is one particular argument to study collective flow in semi - central collisions at energies from a few hundred mev to a few gev per nucleon @xcite .",
    "we have demonstrated that high precision experimental data allows us to study the many facets of the heavy - ion collisions .",
    "other observables , like @xmath21 , should receive a comparable ( and simultaneous ) attention too . whether the nuclear equation of state can be extracted from such studies",
    "depends ultimately on the ability of any type of microscopic transport model to reproduce the measured features .",
