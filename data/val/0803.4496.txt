    "in the mathematical modelling of multi - component stochastic systems , it is conventional to describe their behaviour in terms of random configurations of `` particles '' whose spatio - temporal dynamics is driven by interaction of particles with each other and the environment .",
    "examples are ubiquitous and include various models in statistical mechanics , quantum physics , astrophysics , chemical physics , biology , computer science , economics , finance , etc .",
    "( see @xcite and the extensive bibliography therein )",
    ".    initiated in statistical physics and theory of point processes , the development of a general mathematical framework for suitable classes of configurations was over decades a recurrent research theme fostered by widespread applications .",
    "more recently , there has been a boost of more specific interest in the _ analysis _ and _ geometry _ of configuration spaces . in the seminal papers @xcite ,",
    "an approach was proposed to configuration spaces as _ infinite - dimensional manifolds_. this is far from straightforward , since configuration spaces are not vector spaces and do not possess any natural structure of hilbert or banach manifolds . however , many `` manifold - like '' structures can be introduced , which appear to be nontrivial even in the euclidean case .",
    "we refer the reader to papers @xcite and references therein for further discussion of various aspects of analysis on configuration spaces and applications .",
    "historically , the approach in @xcite was motivated by the theory of representations of diffeomorphism groups ( see @xcite ) . to introduce some notation ,",
    "let @xmath4 be the space of countable subsets ( _ configurations _ ) without accumulation points in a topological space @xmath3 ( e.g. , euclidean space @xmath5 ) .",
    "any probability measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 , quasi - invariant with respect to the action of the group @xmath8 of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of @xmath3 ( lifted pointwise to transformations of @xmath7 ) , generates a canonical unitary representation of @xmath8 in @xmath9 .",
    "it has been proved in @xcite that this representation is irreducible if and only if @xmath10 is @xmath8-ergodic .",
    "representations of such type are instrumental in the general theory of representations of diffeomorphism groups @xcite and in quantum field theory @xcite .    according to a general paradigm described in @xcite , configuration space analysis",
    "is determined by the choice of a suitable probability measure @xmath6 on @xmath7 ( quasi - invariant with respect to @xmath8 ) .",
    "it can be shown that such a measure @xmath10 satisfies a certain integration - by - parts formula , which enables one to construct , via the theory of dirichlet forms , the associated equilibrium dynamics ( stochastic process ) on @xmath7 such that @xmath6 is its invariant measure @xcite . in turn",
    ", the equilibrium process plays an important role in the asymptotic analysis of statistical - mechanical systems whose spatial distribution is controlled by the measure @xmath6 ; for instance , this process is a natural candidate for being an asymptotic `` attractor '' for motions started from a perturbed ( non - equilibrium ) configuration .",
    "this programme has been successfully implemented in @xcite for the poisson measure , which is the simplest and most well - studied example of a @xmath8-quasi - invariant measure on @xmath7 , and in @xcite for a wider class of gibbs measures , which appear in statistical mechanics of classical continuous gases . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that in the poisson case , the equilibrium dynamics amounts to the well - known independent particle process , that is , an infinite family of independent ( distorted ) brownian motions started at the points of a random poisson configuration . in the gibbsian case ,",
    "the dynamics is much more complex due to interaction between the particles .",
    "the gibbsian class ( containing the poisson measure as a simple `` interaction - free '' case ) is essentially the sole example so far that has been fully amenable to such analysis . in the present paper , our aim is to develop a similar framework for a different class of random spatial structures , namely the well - known",
    "_ cluster point processes _ ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "cluster process is a simple model to describe effects of grouping ( `` clustering '' ) in a sample configuration .",
    "the intuitive idea is to assume that the random configuration has a hierarchical structure , whereby independent clusters of points are distributed around a certain ( random ) configuration of invisible `` centres '' .",
    "the simplest model of such a kind is the _ poisson cluster process _",
    ", obtained by choosing a poisson point process as the background configuration of the cluster centres .",
    "cluster models have been very popular in numerous practical applications ranging from neurophysiology ( nerve impulses ) and ecology ( spatial distribution of offspring around the parents ) to seismology ( statistics of earthquakes ) and cosmology ( formation of constellations and galaxies ) .",
    "more recent examples include applications to trapping models of diffusion - limited reactions in chemical kinetics @xcite , where clusterization may arise due to binding of traps to a substrate ( e.g. , a polymer chain ) or trap generation ( e.g. , by radiation damage ) .",
    "an exciting range of new applications in physics and biology is related to the dynamics of clusters consisting of a few to hundreds of atoms or molecules .",
    "investigation of such `` mesoscopic '' structures , intermediate between bulk matter and individual atoms or molecules , is of paramount importance in the modern nanoscience and nanotechnology ( for an authoritative account of the state of the art in this area , see a recent review @xcite and further references therein ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we consider poisson cluster processes in @xmath1 .",
    "we prove the @xmath8-quasi - invariance of the poisson cluster measure @xmath0 and establish the integration - by - parts formula .",
    "we then construct an associated dirichlet form , which implies in a standard way the existence of equilibrium stochastic dynamics on the configuration space @xmath7 .",
    "our technique is based on the representation of @xmath0 as a natural `` projection '' image of a certain poisson measure on an auxiliary configuration space @xmath11 over a disjoint union @xmath12 , comprising configurations of `` droplets '' representing individual clusters of variable size .",
    "a suitable intensity measure on @xmath13 is obtained as a convolution of the background intensity @xmath14 ( of cluster centres ) with the probability distribution @xmath15 of a generic cluster .",
    "this approach enables one to apply the well - developed apparatus of poisson measures to the study of the poisson cluster measure @xmath0 .",
    "let us point out that the projection construction of the poisson cluster measure is very general , and in particular it works even in the case when `` generalized '' configurations ( with possible accumulation or multiple points ) are allowed .",
    "however , to be able to construct a well - defined differentiable structure on cluster configurations , we need to restrict ourselves to the space @xmath4 of `` proper '' ( i.e. , locally finite and simple ) configurations . using the technique of laplace functionals , we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions of almost sure ( a.s . ) properness for poisson cluster configurations , set out in terms of the background intensity @xmath14 of cluster centres and the in - cluster distribution @xmath15 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these conditions appear to be new ( cf . , e.g. , @xcite ) and may be of interest for the general theory of cluster point processes .    some of the results of this paper have been sketched in @xcite ( in the case of clusters of fixed size ) .",
    "we anticipate that the projection approach developed in the present paper can be applied to the study of more general cluster measures on configurations spaces , especially gibbs cluster measure ( see @xcite for the case of fixed - size clusters ) .",
    "such models , and related functional - analytic issues , will be addressed in our future work .",

    "we describe a more general construction of @xmath0 using another poisson measure defined on the space @xmath22 of configurations of pairs @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) , with the product intensity measure @xmath26 .",

    "in this section , we fix some notations and describe the setting of configuration spaces that we shall use . as compared to a standard exposition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , we adopt a more general standpoint by allowing configurations with multiple points and/or accumulation points . with this modification in mind ,",
    "we recall the definition and some properties of poisson point process ( as a probability measure in the generalized configuration space @xmath29 ) .",
    "we then proceed to introduce the main object of the paper , the cluster poisson point process and the corresponding measure @xmath0 in @xmath29 .",
