    "the lanthanide series of the periodic table comprises fifteen members ranging from lanthanum ( la ) to lutetium ( lu ) .",
    "although they are more abundant than silver , and some of them are more abundant than lead , they are known as rare - earth ( re ) elements .",
    "rare  in their name refers to the difficulty of obtaining the pure elements , not to their abundances in nature .",
    "they are never found as free metals in the earth s crust and do not exist as pure minerals .",
    "all having two electrons in the outermost 6__s _ _ orbital , they can form trivalent cations .",
    "their chemistry is largely determined by the ionic radius , which decreases steadily along the series corresponding to the fillings of the 4__f__-orbitals .",
    "one of the principal applications of the rare - earth elements in industry , involving millions of tons of raw material each year , is in the production of catalysts for the cracking of crude petroleum.@xcite they are also commonly used in the glass and display industry.@xcite additionally , rare - earth oxides are regarded as potential candidates for high - k gate dielectrics because of their ability to form direct contact with silicon substrate.@xcite superconductors based on rare - earth oxypnictides@xcite were also discovered with critical temperatures as high as 55 k.@xcite very recently it was shown that the rare - earth oxide ceramics are intrinsically hydrophobic and durable materials preventing water from spreading over a surface.@xcite s. bertaina _ _ et al.__@xcite revealed a new family of spin qubits based on re ions having desired characteristics suitable for scalable quantum computation at @xmath0he temperatures .",
    "adsorption of re adatoms on graphene were investigated by several studies .",
    "in contrast to most of simple and transition metals , it was shown that re adatoms induce significant electric dipole and magnetic moments on graphene.@xcite    although re elements constitute a significant portion of atoms in the periodic table and exhibit unique ( and mostly unexplored ) properties , it is interesting to note that the ab - initio electronic structure calculations with re elements are very scarce .",
    "this is due to the fact that re elements containing 4__f__-electrons are particularly very challenging for density functional theory ( dft ) methods .",
    "it is well known that the narrow _ f_-bands in re compounds are not adequately described by standard local density approximation ( lda)@xcite and generalized - gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite due to strong electronic correlation effects . to cope with this insufficiencies ,",
    "the dft+u method@xcite is often employed , with u fit to some spectral data .",
    "another approach is to use a hybrid functional introducing a portion of exact hartree - fock type exchange into the exchange - correlation functional.@xcite both approaches improve the treatment of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "however dft+u suffers from ambiguity of hubbard u value while hybrid functionals suffer from extremely demanding computational costs .",
    "we realized that reliable dft potentials for majority of re elements are not provided by any open - source@xcite dft simulation environments such as abinit,@xcite siesta , @xcite and quantum espresso.@xcite the aim of this study is to provide projected augmented wave ( paw ) potentials for re elements with some suggested hubbard u values allowing efficient plane - wave calculations .",
    "these potentials were developed to yield results comparable to highly accurate all - electron flapw+lo results using wien2k.@xcite hubbard u values are consistently determined according to all - electron hybrid functional calculations .",
    "the optimization of the potentials were performed on rare - earth nitrides in which re element adopts trivalent ionic state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we present the details about the generation of re paw datasets .",
    "next we investigate the electronic properties of re - nitrides ( ren s ) which will be used as a reference for validation of our generated paw datasets . in section [ sec : comp ]",
    "we compare the performance of generated paw datasets with all - electron flapw+lo results . in section [ sec : match ] we present our procedure of obtaining hubbard u values for feasible dft+u calculations that match results from demanding hybrid functional ( ys - pbe0 ) calculations .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we used atompaw program@xcite to generate projector and basis functions which are needed for performing first principles calculations based on the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method.@xcite for any element in the periodic table , the program inputs the atomic number , exchange - correlation functional , electronic configuration , choice of basis functions , and a cutoff radii .",
    "after initialization , the program can be instructed to output potential files which can be used by open - source density functional simulation environments such as quantum espresso@xcite and abinit.@xcite it also outputs several files enabling wave function and logarithmic derivative plots .",
    "although scandium ( sc ) and yttrium ( y ) belong to rare - earth element family , we focus our attention in the lanthanides ( la - lu ) since paw datasets already exist for sc and y in the atompaw repository . for each lanthanide we used neutral electronic configuration .",
    "6__s _ _ , 5__s _ _ , 5__p _ _ , 5__d _ _ and 4__f _ _ orbitals are treated as valance states .",
    "two projector and basis functions were used for each angular momentum channel ( s , p , d , f ) .",
    "two rydberg reference energy was used to build each partial - waves .",
    "since lanthanides are high - z elements , scalar - relativistic wave equation was used for all - electron computations .",
    "vanderbilt scheme@xcite was used to pseudize partial - waves .",
    "the analytical form of shape functions used in compensation density was chosen according to the besselshape option.@xcite the generated dataset was carefully checked with logarithmic derivatives against ghost states .",
    "[ xe ] 4__f__@xmath15d@xmath26s@xmath3 atomic configuration was assumed for each re in which n=0 for la , n=1 for ce , n=2 for pr , n=3 for nd , etc .",
    "cutoff radius@xcite ( r@xmath4 ) of augmentation regions in the paw formalism was determined according to solid state calculations performed on re - nitrides ( ren s ) .",
    "we first obtained equilibrium lattice constants ( a@xmath5 ) for each ren using the all - electron wien2k@xcite program which employs highly accurate full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave + local orbitals ( flapw+lo ) method .",
    "then we tuned cutoff radius of each paw dataset to yield equilibrium lattice constant error not larger than @xmath60.03 % relative to wien2k .",
    "table [ table : radius ] lists r@xmath4 values for each re .",
    ".muffin - tin radii values ( _ _ r__@xmath7 ) used in wien2k calculations and cutoff radius ( r@xmath4 ) of augmentation regions in paw method used in atompaw .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we have generated accurate and publicly available paw datasets for re elements ( la - lu ) which can be used readily with open - source quantum espresso and abinit dft simulation packages .",
    "similar to common trivalent re ions found in nature , solid state tests and optimizations of paw datasets were performed on rare - earth nitrides .",
    "we find that our optimized paw datasets yield almost identical results to highly accurate all - electron full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave plus local orbital ( flapw+lo ) calculations .",
    "all - electron hybrid functional calculations ( ys - pbe0 ) were carried out to overcome limitations of standard pbe calculations and to be used as reference for the determination of hubbard u values for pbe+u calculations .",
    "pbe results tend to place f - states very close to the fermi level and 2.5 to 5.5 ev hubbard u values are required to place f - states in positions similar to those produced by the ys - pbe0 hybrid functional .",
    "nonzero hubbard u value ( @xmath8 ev ) on empty re d - orbitals was also shown necessary to open a band gap of some ren s , which is consistent with experimental findings .",
    "we believe that these new paw datasets - if used with suggested hubbard u values ( for trivalent high - spin ions ) - will allow further studies on rare - earth materials .",
