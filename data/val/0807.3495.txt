    "studies of matter - wave patterns in degenerate bose @xcite and fermi @xcite gases at ultra - low temperatures have drawn a great deal of attention in the last decade .",
    "the theoretical description of patterns formed in a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) relies upon the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , which produces a remarkably accurate description of various states , including solitons @xcite .",
    "experimentally , bright matter - wave solitons were created in bec of @xmath4li @xcite and @xmath5rb atoms @xcite . in either case , the interaction between the atoms was switched from repulsion to attraction by means of the magnetic field applied near the respective feshbach resonance ( fr ) feshbach , bffesh . in bec with repulsion between atoms , loaded in a periodic optical - lattice ( ol ) potential , which can be created as a standing wave by counter - propagating laser beams illuminating the condensate , localized states can be formed in the form of _ gap solitons _ ( gss ) .",
    "this was predicted taking into consideration the possibility of having a negative effective mass in parts of the bandgap spectrum induced by the periodic potential @xcite .",
    "gss are supported by the interplay of the negative effective mass and repulsive nonlinearity .",
    "they are stable against small perturbations @xcite .",
    "the prediction was followed by the creation of a gs formed by @xmath6 atoms of @xmath7rb in a nearly one - dimensional ( 1d ) , i.e. , cigar - shaped \" , cross - beam optical trap , combined with the longitudinal ol potential markus , markus - review . in the experiment , the gas was subjected to acceleration , in order to push atoms into a state with a negative effective mass .",
    "other theoretically elaborated possibilities for the creation of gss rely on the phase - imprinting method @xcite , or on temporarily adding a strong parabolic trap to the ol potential , with the objective to squeeze the condensate into a small region and then , relaxing the trap , to give the condensate a chance to self - trap into a compact gs state michal .",
    "the creation of degenerate fermi gases ( dfg ) , and observation of the transition to bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluidity in them jin , suggest to consider possibilities of the creation of solitons in dfgs and bcs superfluids .",
    "bright solitons were also predicted in fermi - bose mixtures with repulsion @xcite or attraction @xcite between bosons and strong attraction between fermions and bosons .",
    "a possibility of the existence of fermionic gss was mentioned in work arik , in relation to a model of a binary boson condensate trapped in a one- or two - dimensional ol , with repulsion between the two components and zero intra - species interaction , as the respective system of coupled gpes may also be realized as a system of equations for two fermionic wave functions , and thus the gss reported in @xcite may be interpreted as 1d and 2d _ symbiotic _ two - component gss in the binary dfg ( term symbiotic \" is frequently applied to two - component solitons in situations when each component in isolation is not able to form a soliton , while the coupling between them makes it possible @xcite ) . using more sophisticated models , one - dimensional gss in the fermi - bose mixture with a small number of bose atoms",
    "were predicted @xcite , and a possibility to create solitons in a mixed 1d bose - fermi superfluid composed of a relatively small number of atoms was proposed in sadhanluca .    in the strictly 1d geometry",
    ", the dfg can be mapped into the _ tonks - girardeau gas _ of hard - core bosons @xcite , which , in a certain approximation , may be described by the 1d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with a repulsive quintic term @xcite . in works",
    "fatkhulla , gss were predicted in the latter equation which includes the ol potential , although the solitons reported in those works may be unstable against small perturbations .    in this work",
    ", we aim to predict 1d and 2d gss in a bcs superfluid , which may be formed by fermi atoms with weak attraction between ones with opposite orientations of the atomic spin .",
    "the gss will be found , chiefly , in the form of tightly bound states , localized in a single cell of the ol potential . a rigorous many - body approach to the dynamics of the dfg , based on the system of quantum - mechanical equations of motion for individual fermions , made it possible to demonstrate the formation of fermionic gss in a bose - fermi mixture @xcite .",
    "however , such a microscopic approach becomes unfeasible as the number of fermions increases . a simplified dynamical model of the bcs superfluid relies on the use of a single wave function for fermions bound into cooper pairs .",
    "this approach may be compared to that adopted in the ginzburg - landau theory , where the wave function describing the fermi superfluid is introduced as a phenomenological complex order parameter @xcite . actually , the so developed description of macroscopic objects , such as solitons , is valid in the _ hydrodynamic approximation _ , i.e. , under the condition that the solitons size is much larger than the de broglie wavelength at the fermi surface , in terms of the underlying microscopic distribution of the fermion atoms . as a result , the wave function of the bcs superfluid loaded in the 1d or 2d ol , and confined in the remaining ( transverse ) direction(s ) by a tight cigar - shaped `` or pancake '' trap , obeys , respectively , the 1d or 2d schrdinger equation , which includes the corresponding ol potential and a repulsive nonlinear term of power @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the equation is derived from the lagrangian which includes the energy density for the weakly - coupled bcs superfluid , as obtained in well - known works yang3d .",
    "we construct gs solutions by means of numerical computations , which are guided by an analytical variational approximation ( va ) @xcite ; this approach has produced very accurate results in a model of the bose - fermi superfluid mixture @xcite .",
    "the stability of the gss is established in a numerical form , through direct simulations of the evolution of perturbed solitons .",
    "we conclude that the va performs well in describing profiles of compact _ fundamental _ gss sufficiently deep in bandgaps , but it works poorly near bandgap edges , facing the difficulty in reproducing undulating tails demonstrated by numerical simulations in that case . in the linear limit , the approximation very accurately predicts the location of the left edge of the first finite bandgap .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the derivation of the 1d and 2d equations for the wave function is presented in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "we construct a family of stable fundamental gs solutions in the first two finite bandgaps of the 1d model , using the va based on the gaussian ansatz and direct numerical solutions .",
    "the gs solutions maintain a tightly - bound ( compact ) shape , unless their chemical potential is taken very close to edges of the bandgaps . in section iii",
    ", we also present stable symmetric and antisymmetric bound states of fundamental gss , and consider a possibility of dragging gss by a moving ol potential . in the framework of the gpe ,",
    "the latter issue has drawn considerable attention as a means for transportation of matter - wave solitons , see work @xcite and references therein . in section iv , we report variational and numerical results for stable gss in the 2d equation .",
    "in addition to the case of the square - lattice potential , in section iv we also find 2d _ radial _ gss , supported by an axisymmetric potential which is periodic along the radius ( in bec trapped in the axisymmetric ol , radial gss have been predicted in work @xcite ) .",
    "estimates for the number of atoms in the predicted 1d and 2d gss are given at the end of sections iii and iv , respectively , the result being @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "for the sake of comparison , in sections iii and iv we additionally display variational and numerical results for gs families in the ordinary gpe - based 1d and 2d models , which include the corresponding ol potential and , respectively , the cubic or quintic self - repulsive term . actually , the accuracy provided by the va in the model with the present model , with the nonlinearity of power @xmath0 , is higher than in the models with the cubic or quintic nonlinear terms .",
    "in addition to the spatially symmetric ( even ) fundamental gss , the 1d equation gives rise to _ subfundamental _ ( sf ) solitons , which are localized odd states originating in the second bandgap .",
    "the sf solitons are also squeezed , essentially , into a single cell of the ol potential , but unlike the fundamental gss , they are ( weakly ) unstable .",
    "the sf solitons are considered in appendix . in particular , the va developed for them yields a physically relevant finding : in the linear limit , it accurately predicts the position of the narrow bloch band separating the first and second bandgaps .",
    "we consider a bcs superfluid of fermi atoms with spin @xmath10 and mass @xmath11 , assuming weak attraction between fermions with opposite orientations of the spin . to derive an effective equation for the superfluid order parameter , we start with the well - known expression for the energy density of the weakly coupled bcs superfluid in the 3d space @xcite , @xmath12which is built as an expansion in powers of @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the fermi momentum and scattering length of the weak interaction between fermions in the bcs limit , @xmath16 is the fermi energy , and @xmath17 the atomic density .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ 1a ] ) is a small correction to the first one due to the underlying condition , @xmath18 ( which actually implies that @xmath15 is much smaller than the de broglie wavelength at the fermi surface ) .",

    "( [ 1a ] ) is cast in the form of @xmath21which includes the lowest - order correction proportional to scattering length @xmath15 .    in the framework of the density - functional theory ,",
    "the bcs superfluid is described by a complex order parameter ( wave function ) , @xmath22 , such that @xmath23 .",
    "if the fermi energy is much larger than the depth of the external potential , @xmath24 , the evolution of the order parameter can be derived from the corresponding lagrangian density which includes energy density ( [ 1c ] ) , @xmath25where @xmath26 is the effective mass of the order - parameter field in the density - functional theory , which determines the gradient term in the lagrangian density . such a formalism has been used in the description of fermi superfluids in various contexts @xcite . the euler - lagrange equation which follows from the full lagrangian ,",
    "@xmath27 , where density ( [ density ] ) is inserted , takes the form of the three - dimensional nls equation with the repulsive nonlinear term of power @xmath0 , and a small correction in the form of the cubic term:@xmath28@xmath29 is defined as the atomic density , eq .",
    "( [ threed1 ] ) is supplemented by the normalization condition , @xmath30where @xmath31 is the total number of atoms .    equation ( [ threed1 ] ) , which was derived from the local fermi distribution , applies to the description of spatially nonuniform patterns in the hydrodynamic limit , which assumes that the nonuniformity does not strongly disturb the local distribution . to say it more accurately , the hydrodynamic approach is valid if the characteristic size of the macroscopic pattern ( actually , the width of the soliton , which is close to the ol period , @xmath32 , see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] below ) is much larger than the de broglie wavelength at the fermi surface , i.e. , @xmath33this condition is similar to that necessary for the validity of the hydrodynamic approximation in classical rarefied gases : the scale of the flow must be much larger that the free - path length .",
    "taking @xmath24 as the potential of the 3d  ol , eq . ( [ threed1 ] ) can be used to construct three - dimensional gss .",
    "however , producing systematic results for 3d solitons is a challenging numerical problem . in this work ,",
