    "recent developments in perturbative algebraic quantum field theory @xcite have opened a new perspective also for the classical field theory . using the algebraic approach one can treat the quantum algebra as a deformation of the classical structure .",
    "this view point turned out to be very successful for example in understanding the various notions of renormalization group @xcite and for applications in cosmology @xcite . in the second case",
    "dirac fields play a very important role . in @xcite a suitable modification of the functional approach was developed to describe the anticommuting ( fermionic ) free quantum fields .",
    "the first steps to formulation of the classical theory were made as well .",
    "the complete treatment of classical field theory of bosons shall be presented in @xcite .",
    "since the generalization to fermionic fields leads to some new effects , it is treated separately . in this paper",
    "we present a formalism which bases on the one of @xcite but introduces some new features characteristic to anticommuting fields .",
    "the problem of understanding the classical theory of fermions is a long standing one .",
    "various attempts were made to tackle it .",
    "on the mathematical side there is the variational bicomplex approach @xcite and the supermanifold @xcite or graded manifold @xcite formalism .",
    "the supermanifold approach was used in @xcite .",
    "the geometrical foundations of supermechanics on graded manifolds were formulated in @xcite , including the notion of graded lagrangian , tangent supermanifold , space of velocities and hamiltonian mechanics of a graded system .",
    "the more intuitive but formal approach to the calculus of variation is presented in @xcite .",
    "it applies as well to even as to odd fields .",
    "it seems to be closer to intuition , but does nt provide a clear mathematical structure that can be used to understand the classical theory of fermion fields . following the spirit of @xcite we propose a way to make the formal notions used in @xcite more precise , without loosing the intuition known from practical calculations in classical and quantum field theory .",
    "in contrast to most of the standard approaches we do nt use the grassman valued functions . in this respect our treatment resembles the one of @xcite .",
    "the field configurations are ordinary sections of some vector bundle and the anticommutativity is introduced at the level of functionals .",
    "this way we avoid many of the technical and conceptual problems .",
    "the most difficult problem in understanding the classical theory of fermionic fields is the treatment of models with interaction , such as the gross - neveu @xcite or the thirring model @xcite .",
    "we propose a formalism to deal with this kind of theories in a way which agrees with the spirit of paqft .",
    "the classical structure presented here can be treated as a first step to quantization . in section [ quant ]",
    "we comment further on this point and sketch the way how a deformation quantization can be performed , along the lines of @xcite . the approach presented in this paper",
    "allows not only the treatment of fermionic fields in the functional approach , but also opens a way to a locally covariant treatment of interacting models .",
    "the treatment of the free dirac field was already presented by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : ( 1 ) in the first section we present an overview of all mathematical structures that will be needed for the formulation of the functional framework .",
    "we also define the kinematical structure of the theory .",
    "since we work in the off - shell formalism , the notion of observables shall be introduced at this level without the need to solve the equations of motion .",
    "it will turn out that this is a very crucial point , especially for the fermionic fields .",
    "( 2 ) in the second section we propose a treatment of the dynamics .",
    "we construct the poisson structure ( peierls bracket ) and intertwining maps between different poisson structures ( so called mller maps ) . for the bosonic case",
    ", the existence of these maps for nonlinear actions will be proved in @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) in the next section we treat the example of the gross - neveu model , using the functional methods .",
    "( 4 ) finally we give a sketch of quantization using the deformation of the poisson structure .",
    "in the functional approach to classical field theory @xcite the basic structure is a poisson algebra of classical observables .",
    "it is defined in a slightly abstract way as an algebra of functionals on the configuration space @xmath0 .",
    "one starts with an off - shell setting , i.e. field configurations are not required to be solutions of some dynamical equations .",
    "they are just vector valued functions of a given type on the minkowski spacetime .",
    "for example in case of a scalar field these are smooth functions @xmath1 .",
    "we can identify classical observables with functionals on this space . intuitively speaking",
    ", a measurement performed at a spacetime point @xmath2 can be associated with an evaluation functional @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "of course the full space of functionals is far too big to introduce a sensible structure on it .",
    "we have to impose some regularity conditions .",
    "first we restrict ourselves to functionals that are smooth .",
    "this notion again requires a few comments , since the calculus on infinite dimensional spaces ( and @xmath0 is indeed infinite dimensional ) is a subtle issue . roughly speaking one",
    "endows the space @xmath0 with its natural locally convex topology and defines the derivative of a functional on @xmath0 as a generalization of the directional derivative ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we do nt want to go into the details now , since in the context of fermionic fields we will need a slightly different notion of smoothness anyway . we provide a thorough mathematical discussion of these points in section [ asf ] .",
    "for now let us denote by @xmath5 the space of smooth functionals on @xmath0 . using the definition of the peierls bracket @xcite one can introduce the dynamical poisson structure on @xmath0 in the lagrange formalism .",
    "for the moment let us focus on the example of a free scalar field .",
    "the peierls bracket of two functionals @xmath6 from a suitably chosen domain is defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the causal propagator for the klein - gordon operator .",
    "we already indicated that this expression is well defined only on a suitably chosen domain .",
    "the reason for it is a singular character of the causal propagator @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , the above expression contains implicitly a pointwise multiplication of distributions . to make sense of such an operation one has to control the singularity structure of the objects involved",
    "the whole space @xmath5 is too big to make a poisson algebra out of it , since some functionals are simply too singular for the peierls bracket ( [ peiscalar ] ) to be well defined .",
    "an easy way out is to consider only functionals that are compactly supported and local .",
    "the definition of the spacetime support of a smooth functional is simply a generalization of the distributional support .",
    "@xmath9 the notion of locality is also quite intuitive . according to the standard definition one calls a functional @xmath10 local if it can be expressed as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a function on the jet space over @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the jet of @xmath15 at the point @xmath2 .",
    "it was already recognized in @xcite in the context of perturbative algebraic quantum field theory that the property of locality can be reformulated using the notion of _ additivity _ of a functional together with a certain wavefront set condition ( we come back to it in section [ asf ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that the peierls bracket is well defined on the space of smooth compactly supported local functionals , but it turns out that this space is not closed under @xmath16 . to obtain a poisson algebra one",
    "has to admit objects that are more singular . here",
    "the microlocal analysis comes into play .",
    "note that the wavefront set of the causal propagator is characterized as @xmath17 by applying the hrmander s criterium @xcite for multiplication of distributions one can identify a class of smooth compactly supported functionals for which ( [ peiscalar ] ) makes sense .",
    "the construction outlined here is discussed in details in references @xcite . here",
    "we only indicated most important features , which we will now reproduce for the case of fermionic fields .",
    "note that the algebraic formulation allows us to work on a very abstract level and we can avoid some of the conceptual difficulties of other approaches . in the first step we have to specify our algebra of functionals .",
    "here we encounter a first difference with respect to the bosonic case , since our functionals have to be antisymmetric in some sense . to obtain a suitable framework we have to use tools from functional analysis .",
    "although we will need some abstract mathematics at the beginning , it turns out that once the framework is established , it can be easily applied to physical examples ( section [ dyn ] ) .",
    "we already indicated in the introduction to this section , that first we need to define the basic kinematical objects of the theory .",
    "working off - shell means that at this point we do nt specify the dynamics .",
    "let @xmath18 be an infinite dimensional vector space of field configurations . here",
    "@xmath19 is a @xmath20-dimensional complex vector space in which fields take values and @xmath13 is the minkowski spacetime with the signature @xmath21 .",
    "now we want to implement the notion of _ antisymmetry _ into our kinematical structure .",
    "to this end we construct @xmath22 , the exterior algebra of @xmath0 , by taking the quotient of the tensor algebra over @xmath0 by an ideal @xmath23 .",
    "the resulting algebra is equipped with the antisymmetric @xmath24-product and can be written as a direct sum : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is a subspace of @xmath22 spanned by elements of the form : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "a general element of @xmath22 is a finite sum of elements of spaces @xmath26 ( called homogenous ) .",
    "each space @xmath26 can be embedded in the space of antisymmetric sections @xcite .",
    "the condition of `` asymmetry '' means that : @xmath30 .",
    "we shall denote the space of antisymmetric sections by @xmath31 .",
    "this space can be equipped with the frchet topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of @xmath32 .",
    "this induces also a topology on @xmath26 and it follows that @xmath33 , with respect to this topology .",
    "we define now : @xmath34 the dual of @xmath35 is the direct product : @xmath36 the elements of @xmath37 are called here the _",
    "antisymmetric functionals _ , written as ( possibly infinite ) sequences : @xmath38 , where the components @xmath39 are referred to as homogenous functionals . the evaluation of @xmath40 on an element @xmath41 , @xmath42 is understood as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the natural duality between @xmath31 and @xmath45 .",
    "note that each @xmath40 evaluated on an element of @xmath35 is always a sum of finitely many terms .",
    "we can equip @xmath37 with the antisymmetric wedge product @xcite : @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "the definition of @xmath24 can be now extended to @xmath35 by continuity .",
    "the wedge product is associative and antisymmetric for homogenous elements : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 denote the grades of @xmath53 , @xmath54 respectively .",
    "one can define a derivative on homogenous elements and extend it by linearity to the whole of @xmath37 with the prescription @xcite : @xmath55 it is easy to verify , that the `` derivative '' @xmath56 defined in ( [ der ] ) has the following properties :    1 .",
    "@xmath57 is a graded derivation for every @xmath58 and @xmath59 homogenous , i.e. @xmath60 2 .",
    "[ dis1 ] for each @xmath40 it induces a map : @xmath61 moreover @xmath62 is continuous ( i.e. an element of @xmath63 ) for every @xmath64 .",
    "an object @xmath65 corresponds to the ( formal ) notion of `` the left variational derivative '' of @xmath54 .",
    "the definition given here agrees with @xcite .",
    "one can define also the `` right derivative '' by a suitable modification of the definition of @xmath66 .",
    "3 .   property [ dis1 ] generalizes to : @xmath67 moreover @xmath68 is jointly continuous for every @xmath64 .",
    "is `` anticommutative '' in the following sense : @xmath69    analogously to the commutative case one can consider a particular class of elements of @xmath70 , namely the evaluation functionals : @xmath71 applying the wedge product to these functionals we get a relation : @xmath72      with the kinematical structure introduced in the previous subsection we can start to proceed toward the dynamics . as indicated in the introduction , the functional approach relies heavily on the theory of distributions .",
    "therefore the next step is to include the functional - analytic aspects into our framework .",
    "a natural formulation in case of fermionic fields involves distributions with values in a graded algebra .",
    "since it needs a certain generalization of the usual setting , we devote this section to introduce some abstract mathematical structures that are needed .",
    "we start with some basic definitions concerning distributions . for details",
    "see : @xcite .",
    "to fix the notation , we define : @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 denotes the space of schwartz functions .",
    "these function spaces are equipped with the topology of uniform convergence on compact subsets of @xmath13 .",
    "the corresponding distribution spaces are defined as the topological duals .",
    "this can be also generalized to vector - valued distributions :    [ vector ] let @xmath76 be a locally convex topological vector space with a topology defined by a separable family of seminorms @xmath77 .",
    "we say that @xmath54 is a distribution on @xmath13 with values in @xmath76 if it is a continuous linear mapping from @xmath78 to @xmath76 .",
    "the theory of vector - valued distributions was developed in @xcite .",
    "a slight modification was proposed in @xcite , where one uses sequential completeness instead of quasi - completeness .",
    "most results from the theory of scalar - valued distributions generalize to this setting .",
    "the main difficulty lies in the fact , that there is no natural notion of tensor product for locally convex vector spaces .",
    "also the approximation property does not hold in general .",
    "the situation is much easier if the space @xmath76 is nuclear and ( sequentially ) complete ( see [ tops ] and @xcite for details ) .",
    "this is the case if we take @xmath37 with the weak topology @xmath79 .",
    "a few details concerning the topologies are given in [ tops ] . by the space of distributions with values in @xmath37",
    "we shall understand @xmath80 , where @xmath81 denotes the dual of @xmath78 with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets and @xmath82 is the sequential completion of the tensor product with respect to the tensor product topology .",
    "the notion of vector - valued distributions enables us to formulate the classical theory of fermionic fields in a mathematically elegant way .",
    "note that the map ( [ d1 ] ) can be treated as an element of @xmath83 , i.e. a distribution with values in a grassman algebra .",
    "one can generalize all known operations like convolution , fourier transform and pullback to such objects .",
    "we shall recall them here to set the notation and we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "since @xmath84 and @xmath19 is finite dimensional we provide the definitions for the case @xmath85 , without the loss of generality .",
    "since @xmath19 is finite dimensional , it can be always introduced with the natural pairing of @xmath19 and @xmath86 . in physical examples this dual pairing is usually provided by some natural structure . in case of dirac fields , this is the pairing between spinors and cospinors and for the ghost fields in gauge theories it is induced by the killing form of the gauge algebra . ] .",
    "let @xmath87 and @xmath88 , where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "we have an antysymmetric bilinear product on @xmath37 defined as : @xmath92 .",

    "we can define a `` pointwise product '' of two distributions @xmath116 by a straightforward extension of @xcite :    let @xmath117 , @xmath118 ( open ) .",

    "obviously we have : @xmath125 , whenever these expressions are well defined . in the following",
    "we shall also use a more suggestive notation : @xmath126 .",
    "now we want to impose some regularity conditions on the distributions we want to consider .",
    "this is important for the definition of the subspace of @xmath37 , where the peierls bracket is well defined .",
    "let @xmath127 be an open cone .",
    "we denote by @xmath128 the subspace of @xmath129 consisting of distributions with wave front set contained in @xmath130 .",

    "with analogy to the bosonic case we call these objects _",
    "microcausal functionals_. space @xmath132 has two important subspaces : @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",
    "elements of @xmath135 would be called even and elements of @xmath136 , odd .",
    "since we are using the weak topology on @xmath37 , @xmath132 can be equivalently characterized as a space of functionals satisfying : @xmath137 where @xmath138 is treated as an element of @xmath139 .",
    "we can impose a more restrictive condition on the wave front set to define a subspace @xmath140 consisting of _ local functionals_. a functional @xmath141 is called local if it satisfies : @xmath142 and is supported on @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the thin diagonal of @xmath32 .",
    "this more abstract notion agrees with the notion of locality ( [ local ] ) mentioned in the introduction .",
    "@xmath132 can be equipped with various topologies , for example the weak topology @xmath79 inherited from @xmath37 .",
    "since we want to have control of the wavefront sets of functional derivatives , we shall use instead the so called hrmander topology @xcite .",
    "let @xmath145 be a closed cone contained in @xmath130 .",
    "we introduce ( following @xcite ) the family of seminorms on @xmath146 given by : @xmath147 , where the index set consists of @xmath148 such that @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 is a closed cone in @xmath152 with @xmath153 .",
    "these seminorms , together with the seminorms of the weak topology provide a defining system for a locally convex topology denoted by @xmath154 .",
    "to control the wavefront set properties inside open cones , we take an inductive limit .",
    "it is easy to see that , to form this inductive limit , one can choose the family of closed cones contained inside @xmath130 to be countable .",
    "the resulting topology will be denoted by @xmath155 .",

    "a generalized lagrangian @xcite @xmath53 is defined to be a map @xmath165 such that @xmath166 the second condition is called _ additivity_. one can think of it as a weaker replacement for the notion of linearity .",
    "it is crucial in the quantum field theory , where one uses the test function as a localized coupling constant @xcite . to admit interaction terms that are of higher order in the coupling ( for example @xmath167 ) one has to drop the linearity condition , whereas the additivity still holds .",

    "<S> in this paper , we present a formulation of the classical theory of fermionic ( anticommuting ) fields , which fits into the general framework proposed by r.  brunetti , m.  dtsch and k.  fredenhagen . </S>",
    "<S> it was inspired by the recent developments in perturbative algebraic quantum field theory and allows for a deeper structural understanding also on the classical level . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a modification of this formalism that allows to treat also fermionic fields . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to other formulations of classical theory of anticommuting variables , we do nt introduce additional grassman degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> instead the anticommutativity is introduced in a natural way on the level of functionals . </S>",
    "<S> moreover our construction incorporates the functional - analytic and topological aspects , which is usually neglected in the treatments of anticommuting fields . </S>",
    "<S> we also give an example of an interacting model where our framework can be applied . </S>"
