    "dynamics of globally coupled oscillators continues to be a highly active topic of research for the past four decades or so because of its applicability to complex systems @xcite . in particular , chimera is a dynamical state where synchronized and desynchronized oscillators coexist in networks of coupled identical oscillators @xcite . ranging from chemical reactions @xcite , laser arrays , and nano - oscillators to the cognitive behaviour of the brain @xcite , chimera states play a crucial role in explaining various important dynamical behaviour involved in these real world systems @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the case of epileptic seizures , certain regions of the brain remain highly synchronized while the remaining regions are desynchronized @xcite . in the case of parkinson s disease ,",
    "synchronized activity is absent in certain regions of the brain @xcite due to damaged or lost cells . in many mammals",
    "uni - hemispherical sleep is a phenomenon where only one hemisphere of the brain shows sleep activity and the sleeping side of the brain exhibits highly synchronized activity while the awaken side shows desynchronized activity @xcite .",
    "chimera states have also been identified or modeled in mechanical oscillator networks @xcite , formation of ocular dominance stripes @xcite , in social systems , during ventricular fibrillation @xcite , and so on @xcite .",
    "very recently distinct measures to characterize these states have also been introduced @xcite .",
    "earlier studies indicated that coupled oscillator systems should have weak , and nonlocal coupling in order to have chimera behaviour . even though considerable promising results have been obtained both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite",
    ", the above two essential ingredients posed a restriction on the occurrence of chimera states .",
    "interestingly , recently chimera states have been found to exist in globally coupled systems as well .",
    "the occurrence of chimera states is found to be mediated by the amplitude in the coupling in complex ginzburg - landau systems @xcite .",
    "the existence of chimera states due to delay induced multistability have also been recently reported @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explore and bring out explicitly the exact reason behind the occurrence of chimera states in globally coupled systems without the inclusion of weak , and nonlocal coupling .",
    "we find that the introduction of intensity dependent self interaction increases the number of fixed points which in turn increases the number of multistable attractors in the system whose stability is determined by the strength of the coupling between the individual units . on this reasoning",
    "we find that the system exhibits a multistable behaviour where it follows a path either to a synchronized state or to a chimera state depending upon the initial state . in order to investigate",
    "such intensity induced chimera states and to study the associated multistable behaviour , we consider two different coupled nonlinear dynamical systems , namely ( 1 ) coupled van der pol oscillators and ( 2 ) coupled rssler systems , as prototypical models .",
    "we investigate their collective behaviour in the periodic regime ( of both the systems ) as well as the chaotic regime ( of rssler system ) of individual units .",
    "the plan of the article as follows . in the following section we investigate the collective dynamics of a system of coupled van der pol oscillators in the presence of an intensity dependent frequency / interaction to show the existence of chimera states .",

    "iv we further demonstrate the occurrence of intensity induced chimeras in globally coupled rssler oscillators and multistability nature when the individual units are oscillating either periodically or chaotically .",
    "we point out applications of the proposed results and our conclusions in sec.v . in appendix",
    "a we present the salient features of characterization of chimera and other collective states in terms of the newly introduced measure  @xcite , namely strength of incoherence ( @xmath0 ) , while in appendix b we present some further details of the collective states and multistable behaviour in the chaotic regime of rssler oscillators .",

    "the present study is concerned with the role of intensity dependent terms @xmath19 , @xmath20 in realizing chimera states under global coupling .    to begin with",

    "the quantities @xmath28 and @xmath0 are identified separately    four different parametric choices are considered in our study and the resultant collective states characterized by the strength of incoherence @xmath0 ( and @xmath28 ) are shown in fig .",
    "these four states correspond to the following .",
    "+ ( i ) for the choice @xmath32 , @xmath33 , which corresponds to a system of coupled standard type van der pol oscillators , we observe that the system transits from a desynchronized state , characterized by @xmath26 , to a synchronous state ( @xmath24 ) as the coupling strength @xmath13 is increased ( fig .",
    "+ ( ii ) when the intensity coefficient @xmath21 alone is increased to @xmath34 while @xmath35 , the coupled oscillators again transit from a desynchronized state to a synchronous state as seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) . + ( iii ) next , when we increase the value of the intensity coefficient @xmath21 further ( along with additional coupling @xmath36 for convenience ) , namely @xmath37 , @xmath16 , we observe that the system gets transited from a synchronized state ( @xmath24 ) to a chimera state ( @xmath25 ) , and then again to a synchronized state as the coupling strength @xmath13 is varied upwards .",
    "+ ( iv ) finally , on including both the intensity dependent terms in ( 1 ) by choosing @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and keeping @xmath36 , the system is found to again transit from a synchronized state to a chimera state via a cluster state @xmath38 and then again to a synchronized state ( over a wider range in @xmath13 ) as @xmath13 is increased .",
    "the above studies clearly demonstrate that chimera states result as a consequence of addition of intensity dependent self interaction .",

    "we also note here that considering equation ( 1 ) and carrying out a slow amplitude analysis by assuming @xmath102 c.c , where @xmath67 represents the slow time scale , and working out a multi - time scale approximation we arrive at the form @xmath103 , @xmath75 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which is similar to the coupled ginzburg - landau oscillators equation ( 1 ) in ref .",

    "@xcite , the coupling in the system is either too low or too high ( as experienced by the individual neurons ) so that the system swings to a mass pathological synchronization state corresponding to regions i or iv in fig .",
    "3 .    in the case of spin torque nano oscillators",
    "the problem of coupling a large number of oscillators in order to achieve coherent microwave power still remains open @xcite .",
    "this is because introducing the coupling leads to an increase in the number of stable attractors in the system @xcite , and this causes the emergence of chimera like states ( synchronized clusters and desynchronized oscillators coexist ) @xcite .",
    "our results therefore help in identifying the underlying cause for the crucial dynamical phenomena that occur in real world systems .",
    "the results also assist in gaining a better understanding of those dynamical phenomena thereby possibly helping researchers to control the occurrence of them depending upon whether they are desirable ( task specific synchronization in the brain , and synchronization of spin torque nano oscillators ) or undesirable ( pathological mass synchronization ) .",

    "other parameter values are @xmath115 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( the individual nodes are oscillating in the chaotic states for these parameters ) . ]",
    "recently we have introduced a specific quantitative measure , namely the strength of incoherence ( @xmath0 )  @xcite to represent various dynamical states . to understand the quantitative measure @xmath0 , we consider the difference dynamical variables of the system @xmath29 , @xmath149 . now",

    "consequently @xmath154 s take a value zero for synchronized states and nonzero values for both desynchronized and chimera states . to overcome the latter difficulty we divide the oscillators into @xmath155 ( even ) bins of equal length @xmath156 .",
    "then , we introduce the local standard deviation @xmath157 which can be defined as @xmath158 ^ 2 } \\hspace{0.1cm}\\big>_{t } , \\hspace{0.1cm}m=1,2, ... m . \\label{6}\\ ] ]    the above quantity @xmath157 is calculated for every successive @xmath159 number of oscillators . using ( [ 6 ] ) we can introduce the measure named strength of incoherence @xmath0 as + @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the heaviside step function , and @xmath162 is a predefined threshold that is reasonably small . here , we take @xmath162 as a certain percentage value of difference between @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "thus when @xmath157 is less than @xmath162 , the value of @xmath165 , otherwise it is 0. consequently , @xmath0 takes the values @xmath26 or @xmath24 or @xmath166 for desynchronized , synchronized and chimera states , respectively .",
    "the cluster states can also be distinguished , as discussed in sec .",
    "ii , by introducing another strength of incohernce @xmath28 .",
    "for details see ref  @xcite .",
    "( color online ) the strength of incoherence @xmath0 ( and also @xmath28 ) is plotted against coupling strength @xmath13 for different values of intensity @xmath114 for system ( [ 4 ] ) for @xmath23 when the individual units are oscillating in the chaotic regime .",
    "the parameter values are @xmath115 , @xmath167 and @xmath135 .",
    "the values of the other parameter @xmath114 are indicated in the figure . ]",
    "in this appendix , we present the various collective states of ( [ 4 ] ) when the individual rssler oscillators , in the absence of intensity dependent interaction ( @xmath119 ) and coupling ( @xmath145 ) , evolve chaotically .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "8 the strength of incoherence @xmath0 ( and also @xmath28 for cluster states ) as a function of coupling strength @xmath13 , for various values of the intensity parameter @xmath114 .",
    "the other parameters are chosen as @xmath115 , @xmath168 and @xmath135 as in fig .",
    "7 . for @xmath119 ,",
    "the system transits from a desynchronized state ( @xmath26 ) to a synchronized state ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "next , when the intensity dependent interaction @xmath114 is included as @xmath121 , the system transits from a desynchronized state to a chimera state ( @xmath169 ) and then transits to a synchronized state as @xmath13 is increases .",
    "we may also note that during the transition from chimera state to synchronized state , cluster states also occur and they are characterized by @xmath24 , @xmath170 .",
    "similar behaviour occurs for @xmath171 also .",
    "further , we have also confirmed that as in the case of van der pol oscillators ( fig .",
    "2 ) the existence of chimera states in the coupled rssler systems ( 11 ) is essentially due to the presence of intensity dependent term ( @xmath131 ) and it exhibits multistable behaviour depending on the initial state even when the individual units are evolving in the chaotic regime as shown in fig . 9 . in fig",
    ". 9 , we have plotted the snapshots of dynamical variables @xmath41 fo two different initial states is1 ( oscillators are randomly distributed in the range [ -1,1 ] ) and is2 ( all the units are close to a synchronized state ) . for is1 the system exhibits a chimera state , while the system evolves into a synchronized state for is2 .",
    "the time averaged frequency for is1 is also plotted in the inset of fig . 9 which also confirms the above facts . from fig .",
    "9 , it is clear that the system typically exhibits a multistable behaviour .",
