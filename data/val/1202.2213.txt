    "among the most interesting new classes of materials under intense investigation in spintronics@xcite are the so - called multiferroics which combine several ferroic orders like ferromagnetism , ferroelectricity , ferroelasticity etc.@xcite the compounds combining the electric and magnetic order@xcite have several potential applications like magnetic - field sensors and electric - write magnetic - read random - access memories.@xcite magnetic order and ferroelectricity have different origins@xcite and thus the materials exhibiting the magnetoelectric effect are few and the coupling between the magnetic and electric properties is weak .",
    "an alternative route to achieve a strong coupling could be the growth of thin film heterostructures and several advances have been made towards the magnetic control of ferroelectricity@xcite and the electric control of thin film magnetism.@xcite    bismuth ferrite is probably the most studied representative of magnetoelectric materials .",
    "bulk bifeo@xmath0 crystallizes in a perovskite - like pseudocubic structure instead of a ferrite one and is classified as a ferroelectric g - type antiferromagnet.@xcite several first - principles calculations have been carried out to study the properties of bulk bifeo@xmath0@xcite and we refer readers to ref . for an overview of the literature on this compounds . since the single - component crystals like bifeo@xmath0 present only a weak magnetoelectric effect ,",
    "an alternative route to achieve a more strong effect has been proposed to be the growth of heterostructures where epitaxial strain can enhance the phenomenon.@xcite thus first - principles calculations of such heterostructures involving alternating layers of bifeo@xmath0 and various spacers can serve as a test - ground to study the behavior of electric and magnetic properties of films .",
    "the study of the latter in the case of ultrathin epitaxial films is the aim of the present manuscript .    in a recent publication ( ref . )",
    "we have presented extended first - principles calculations , employing the quantum - espresso@xcite ab - initio electronic structure method in conjunction with the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - erzenhof formulation,@xcite on the electronic and magnetic properties of bifeo@xmath0 alloy as a function of the lattice constant in the case of the cubic perovskite structure ( see figure 1 in ref . ) . in ref .",
    "we have extended this study to cover also the case of mn substation for fe .",
    "all compounds under study in these two references exhibited significant magnetic properties with spin magnetic moments at the fe and mn sites of the order of 3 @xmath1 .",
    "in the present contribution we expand these two studies using the same ab - initio method with grids of the same density in the * k*-space to cover also the case of ultrathin epitaxial films .",
    "although these films are ideal cases and can not be , with few exceptions , be realized experimentally , they can serve as starting point to understand the interplay between the interface structure and the magnetic properties of bifeo@xmath0 films with other spacers . for completeness we took into account three different spacers to cover different cases of electronic properties at the interface : inp semiconductor , metallic v and ferromagnetic fe .",
    "in section ii we present the structure of the multilayers and the results for the case of the inp spacer , in section iii the cases of fe and v metallic spacers and finally in section iv we present the main conclusions of our work .",
    "along the [ 001 ] direction bifeo@xmath0 can be considered to consist of alternating layers of bio and feo@xmath2 as shown in fig .",
    "the in - plane unit cell is a square of the same lattice constant as the cubic unit cell of the bulk bifeo@xmath0 .",
    "inp crystallizes in the zincblende structure , similar to gaas , as most of the iii - v semiconductors , and has an experimental lattice constants of 5.87  . along the [ 001 ] direction",
    ", the zincblende structure can be viewed as consisting of alternating pure in and pure p atomic layers as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . to fully describe the zincblende structure we have to consider , except the in and p atoms , also the occurrence of vacant sites ( voids )",
    "; there are exactly two no - equivalent voids within the zincblende unit cell . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] along the [ 001 ] direction there are not two but four alternating non - equivalent atomic layers .",
    "the difference between the a(b ) and c(d ) layers is that the in(p ) atoms have exchanged sites with the voids .",
    "this exchange of atomic positions is important since it lead to four non - equivalent interfaces between inp and bifeo@xmath0 in our study .",
    "finally we have to mention that the lattice constant of inp coincides with the bifeo@xmath0 lattice constant multiplied by the square root of two : @xmath3 .",
    "thus as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the diagonal of the bifeo@xmath0 two - dimensional square unit cell can be assumed to be the side of the corresponding unit cell of the inp ( denoted with red color in the figure ) and thus epitaxial growth between inp and bifeo@xmath0 can be assumed .",
    "( b ) possible terminations of the bifeo@xmath0 alloy along the [ 001 ] direction . with the red lines we denote the limits of the two - dimensional unit cell of inp ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) which has a lattice constant : @xmath4 . ]    for the inp / bifeo@xmath0 multilayers we studied four different cases with respect to the relative position of the atoms at the interface between the two spacers . along the growth axis we took into account eight atomics layers which are repeated in the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "initially we studied the structure ... feo@xmath2//in / p / in / p / bio / feo@xmath2/bio / feo@xmath2//in ... , and thus in the first case we have two non - equivalent interface in our structure : a p / bi and an in / fe ones .",
    "a close examination of figs . [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] reveals that , in the case just mentioned : ( a ) with respect to the p / bi interface p atoms are situated in the diagonal connecting bi atoms ( compare ( a ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with the d layer in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , and ( 2 ) with respect to the in / fe interface in atoms are situated in the midpoint between fe nearest neighbors ( take into account a layer in fig . [ fig2 ] and combine it with the ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "direction taking into account also the vacant sites .",
    "the structure is built using four alternating pure atomic layers a , b , c and d. the difference between a(b ) and c(d ) is that the in(p ) atoms and the voids have exchanged sites . ]    in the second case under study in and p atoms have exchanged sites with respect to the first case under study and thus now we have along the [ 001 ] direction a ... feo@xmath2//p / in / p / in / bio / feo@xmath2/bio / feo@xmath2//p ... structure , _",
    "i.e. _ the inequivalent interfaces are now in / bi and fe / p .",
    "notice that as in the fe / in interface in case 1 , also in the p / fe interface , which occurs in case 2 , the p atoms at the interface are located in the midpoints between the fe atoms ( if we examine only the in - plane projection of the multilayer ) just above the oxygen atoms and this results to vanishing magnetism in case 2 under study as will be discussed later in the next subsection .",
    "as we mentioned above the structure of inp along the [ 001 ] direction should be viewed as consisting of four atomic layers ( see fig . [ fig2 ] ) since voids play a crucial role in interfaces . if in the two previous cases 1 and 2 we exchange layer a(b ) with layer c(d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we get two new cases 3 and 4 with different arrangement of the atoms at the interface . in case 3(4 ) , the succession of the atomic layers is similar to case 1(2 ) .",
    "when we compare case 1(2 ) with case 3(4 ) , we conclude that the p(in)/bi interfaces are similar since the p(in ) atoms are now situated at the other diagonal connecting the bi atoms .",
    "critical is the other in(p)/feo@xmath2 interface since now in case 3(4 ) the in(p ) atoms are located just above the fe atoms while in case 1(2 ) they were located above the oxygen atoms at the midpoints between neighboring fe atoms .      in all cases under study",
    "our results converged to the ferromagnetic solution independently of the initial conditions and initial arrangement of the spin moments . as in - plane lattice",
    "constant we have chosen the @xmath5   @xmath6   ( 11.1 a.u . ) which is the experimental lattice constant of inp and moreover for the lattice constant of 4.153   bifeo@xmath0 exhibits very pronounced magnetic properties.@xcite as a result of the epitaxial growth along the [ 001 ] axis the lattice constant was 14.182   ( 26.8 a.u . ) .",
    "spacer ( fe@xmath7 at the middle of the spacer and fe@xmath8 at the feo@xmath2 interface for all four cases under study ( see text for explanation ) .",
    "positive dos corresponds to the majority spin ( spin - up ) electrons and negative dos to the minority spin ( spin - down ) electrons .",
    "the fermi level has been assigned to the zero energy . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the density of states ( dos ) of the fe d - orbitals for all four cases under study .",
    "we denote as fe@xmath7 the fe atoms within the bifeo@xmath0 spacer and with fe@xmath8 the fe atoms located at the interface .",
    "we have also to note here that for the multilayer structures under study , we have a complete lift of the degeneracy of the fe d - orbitals and we can not refer anymore to the double - degenerated @xmath9 and triple degenerated @xmath10 orbitals as in bulk bifeo@xmath0 . in case 2 where we have",
    "a p / bi interface our calculations have converged to a non - magnetic solution .",
    "the loss of magnetism in this case should be attributed to the reduced hybridization between the neighboring fe and p atoms at the interface .",
    "the latter have as valence 3p electrons which are less extended in space with respect to the in 5p valence states and do not hybridize with the fe d - orbitals at the interface . in case i ,",
    "the d - band is shifted to higher energy values for the spin - down electrons with respect to the spin - up electrons .",
    "this is more easy to visualize for the fe@xmath8 atoms since their hybridization with the p - orbitals of in leads to more pronounced electronic properties ( smaller bandwidth with respect to the fe@xmath7 atoms and thus more intense picks ) .",
    "the latter is also reflected on the spin magnetic moments presented in table [ table1 ] where the spin magnetic moments are considerable larger for fe@xmath8 with respect to fe@xmath7 .",
    ".fe spin magnetic moments in @xmath1 within the bifeo@xmath0 spacer for the inp / bifeo@xmath0 epitaxial ultrathin multilayers for all four cases under study ( see text for explanation of different cases ) .",
    "the bifeo@xmath0 spacer contains two inequivalent atoms : fe@xmath7 at the middle of the bifeo@xmath0 spacer and fe@xmath8 at the interface . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     similar is the situation for the fe spacer where for the two smaller lattice constants we could not even converge our calculations .",
    "as shown in table [ table3 ] only for the largest value of the lattice constant we got significant values of the fe spin magnetic moments , which even for this case , are considerable smaller than the spin magnetic moments of fe atoms of the bifeo@xmath0 spacer ( @xmath110.2 @xmath1 for fe spacer compared to @xmath11 0.8 @xmath1 for bifeo@xmath0 spacer ) and are about one order of magnitude smaller than in bulk fe .",
    "we have also included in table [ table3 ] the results for the interface structure of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , denoted as `` case 5-ii '' where we have changed the positions of the v(fe ) atoms at the interface .",
    "overall also in this case the magnetic properties of the spacer are not significant . only in the case of the fe / bifeo@xmath0 multilayer half the fe atoms at layer 1 ( located at the interface with feo@xmath2 ) present a significant spin magnetic moment of about 0.5 @xmath1 which is still much lower than the bulk fe value .",
    "we expand our study on the magnetic properties bifeo@xmath0 presented in refs . and to the case of ultrathin epitaxial multilayers using the quantum - espresso first - principles electronic structure",
    "method.@xcite we have studied several cases of these ultrathin epitaxial bifeo@xmath0 multilayers using different types of spacers covering a wide range of electronic materials : inp semiconductor , ferromagnetic fe and metallic v. irrespectively of the spacer the magnetic properties of the multilayers were found to seriously degrade due to the low - symmetry of the film and in some cases magnetism vanished completely .",
    "thus ultrathin multilayers of bifeo@xmath0 are not suitable for spintronic applications",
    ". more extended calculations covering more thick multilayers and including quantum molecular dynamics are needed in the future to determine in more detail the properties of the interfaces of bifeo@xmath0 with other alloys .",
