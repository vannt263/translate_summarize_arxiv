    "we consider , for some integer @xmath0 , the semilinear wave equation @xmath1 with @xmath2-periodic boundary conditions in one space dimension ( @xmath3 ) . denoting by @xmath4 the sobolev space @xmath5 , we equip this equation with initial values @xmath6 we are in particular interested in the case @xmath7 , where the energy is finite .    after a semi - discretization in space , this nonlinear wave equation becomes a huge system of ordinary differential equations of the form @xmath8 with a matrix @xmath9 describing the discretized second spatial derivative in   and a nonlinearity @xmath10 describing the polynomial nonlinearity in  .",
    "the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath9 , i.e. , the eigenvalues of the discretized laplace operator , range from order one to the order of the spatial discretization parameter .",
    "the spatial discretization parameter is typically large , in particular for initial values of low regularity , such as with @xmath7 , for which a very large spatial discretization parameter compensates for the slow convergence of the semi - discretization in space , see @xcite for the case of a spectral semi - discretization in space .",
    "the spatial semi - discretization thus exhibits a variety of oscillations , ranging from low to high oscillations .    for the discretization in time of oscillatory systems of the form  , the use of a _ trigonometric integrator _ ( or _ exponential integrator _ )",
    "is increasingly popular .",
    "see , for instance , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter  xiii ) and the recent review @xcite .",
    "these integrators are especially designed to deal with the matrix @xmath11 and the induced high oscillations .",
    "there are several papers that consider trigonometric integrators when applied to wave equations . in @xcite ,",
    "the long - time behaviour of these methods with respect to conserved or almost conserved quantities is studied . moreover ,",
    "the methods are extended to higher order in @xcite and to the linear stochastic wave equation in @xcite .    to our knowledge",
    ", however , there is no rigorous error analysis of trigonometric integrators applied to spatial semi - discretizations of nonlinear wave equations such as   yet , for example for initial values of finite energy , that is   with @xmath7 .",
    "the main challenge are error bounds that are uniform in the large frequencies and the size of the system , and hence in the spatial discretization parameter , and that allow for initial values of low regularity , such as   with @xmath7 .    in the present paper",
    "we prove such error bounds of trigonometric integrators applied to a spectral semi - discretization in space .",
    "we consider in particular initial values of finite energy and exact solutions @xmath12 of the spatial semi - discretization   in a discrete counterpart of @xmath13 . under such low regularity assumptions ,",
    "we show , amongst others , second - order convergence of @xmath12 in @xmath14 and first - order convergence in @xmath15 .",
    "the analysis covers the impulse method @xcite which coincides in our situation with the method of deuflhard @xcite and the mollified impulse method of garca - archilla , sanz - serna & skeel @xcite as well as the trigonometric methods proposed by hairer & lubich @xcite and by grimm & hochbruck @xcite .",
    "we mention that there are many papers that study the error of various instances of trigonometric integrators when applied to systems of the form  , see @xcite . in all these works",
    ", it is assumed that the nonlinearity is in particular lipschitz continuous .",
    "this , however , is _ not _ the case for the nonlinear wave equation   or typical spatial semi - discretizations thereof , for example when considered in the space @xmath16 which is the natural space to prove error estimates for initial values of finite energy .",
    "an exception is the sine  gordon equation @xmath17 , whose nonlinearity is indeed lipschitz continuous in @xmath16 , and for which gautschi - type trigonometric integrators have been analysed in @xcite .",
    "another way to avoid the non - lipschitz continuous nonlinearity is to consider equations such as   in higher order sobolev spaces , where the nonlinearity is locally lipschitz continuous , and where second - order error bounds can then be shown under correspondingly higher regularity assumptions on the exact solution , see @xcite and also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter iv ) .",
    "yet another way to deal with the non - lipschitz nonlinearity is to impose additional assumptions on the numerical solution , such as bounds in @xmath18 that are uniform in the time step - size .",
    "the validity of such an assumption on the numerical solution is at first not clear , however .",
    "under such an unclear assumption , the aforementioned previous results and their proofs would also hold for non - lipschitz nonlinearities such as @xmath19 . in the present paper ,",
    "we use an analysis that proves such properties of the numerical solution , notably without requiring higher regularity of the exact solution .",
    "this is done by exploiting the full scale of sobolev spaces , including sobolev spaces of negative order .",
    "more precisely , the error analysis is performed in two stages .",
    "first , a low order error bound is shown in a higher order sobolev space ( or its discrete counterpart ) , where the nonlinearity is , at least locally , lipschitz continuous . from this low order error bound , a suitable regularity of the numerical solution",
    "is deduced .",
    "this regularity is then used in the second stage to overcome the lack of lipschitz continuity in lower order sobolev spaces and allows us to show higher order error bounds in these spaces .",
    "such kinds of two - stage arguments have been used previously , for example in @xcite for discretizations of nonlinear schrdinger equations and in @xcite for discretizations of equations with burgers nonlinearity .    surprisingly , it is possible to do the error analyses in both stages following the traditional argument of error accumulation in lady windermere s fan .",
    "this is in striking contrast to previous error analyses of trigonometric integrators given for different situations in @xcite , where cancellation effects in the accumulation of errors are of vital importance . in the case of the nonlinear wave equation ,",
    "not only a conceptually different proof is possible , but also less restrictive assumptions on the filter functions that characterize the trigonometric integrator in a one - step formulation are needed .",
    "therefore , a considerably larger class of trigonometric integrators in one - step formulation is covered by the presented analysis , in particular methods that do not use a filter inside the nonlinearity .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec - method ] , the considered discretization is introduced , the error bounds are stated and numerical experiments are presented .",
    "the proof of the error bounds is given in section  [ sec - proof ] .",
    "the presented error analysis of trigonometric integrators is not restricted to the spectral semi - discretization in space of the nonlinear wave equation   with pure power nonlinearity .",
    "it applies equally to the spectral semi - discretization of nonlinear wave equations with general polynomial or analytic nonlinearities and to the spatial semi - discretization by finite differences , as is described in section  [ sec - ext ] .",
    "moreover , the analysis can be extended to the widely used strmer  verlet / leapfrog discretization in time by interpreting this method as a trigonometric integrator with modified frequencies , which is also described in section  [ sec - ext ] .",
    "for the semi - discretization in space of the nonlinear wave equation  , we consider spectral collocation .",
    "the trigonometric polynomial @xmath20 defined by its fourier coefficients @xmath21 with indices @xmath22 from the finite index set @xmath23 is used as an ansatz for the solution of the nonlinear wave equation .",
    "inserting this ansatz in the nonlinear wave equation and evaluating in the collocation points @xmath24 with @xmath25 then leads to the system @xmath26 for the vector @xmath27 of fourier coefficients ( the vector @xmath28 belongs to the set @xmath29 of complex vectors indexed by @xmath23 ) . here",

    "this choice is possible if these fourier coefficients form absolutely summable sequences , and it corresponds then to a trigonometric interpolation of @xmath42 and @xmath43 in the collocation points @xmath44 , @xmath25 . if the initial values @xmath42 and @xmath43 are given by their fourier coefficients , the choice @xmath45 is computationally advantageous .",
