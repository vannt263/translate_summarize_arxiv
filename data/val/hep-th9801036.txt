    "complex curve of hyperelliptic type and a specific differential , the seiberg - witten form , on it provide natural tools for this moduli geometry called rigid special geometry @xcite .",
    "the deep meaning of these objects , which appeared auxiliary , has been made clear from the viewpoint of calabi - yau compactification of type ii strings @xcite and also from @xmath2 theory @xcite .",
    "recent developments in dualities of superstrings and @xmath2 theory have made it more practical and important to consider higher dimensional susy gauge theories that are perturbatively non - renormalizable . among them in this article we will bring into focus the five dimensional ( 5d ) theory compactified on a circle @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons why this theory is interesting .",
    "for example , it is a susy gauge theory directly related to the calabi - yau compactification of @xmath2 theory and its type iia limit .",
    "it also gives us various tests on the idea of the low energy effective action of susy gauge theories .",
    "moreover , 5d gauge theory is linked to topological field theory and current algebra in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "there is an intriguing connection of the seiberg - witten theory to the theory of integrable systems .",
    "the hyperelliptic curve of pure gauge theory can be identified as the spectral curve of the periodic toda system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the seiberg - witten form is given by the canonical one - form @xmath3  of the symplectic dynamics .",
    "finally the prepotential is related to the tau function of the integrable system .",
    "the compactified 5d susy gauge theory seems to be accommodated to this idea .",
    "nekrasov proposed a relativistic generalization of the periodic toda system as an underlying integrable system for 5d theory @xcite .",
    "more generally the periodic spin chain is to be associated with five and six dimensional theories compactified to four dimensions @xcite .",
    "it has been argued that the 5d susy gauge theory has no instanton corrections @xcite .",
    "however , it is no longer true , if we compactify the theory to an effective four dimensional one .",
    "in addition to the usual four dimensional one - loop corrections we expect one - loop contributions from an infinite tower of the kaluza - klein modes . there should be also instanton corrections .",
    "both effects are supposed to be encoded in the complex curve for the periods and the prepotential .    in this paper",
    "we will work out the picard - fuchs equation for the periods of 5d susy @xmath1 gauge theory .",
    "though the curve itself looks quite similar to the one for four dimensional theory , the identification of moduli parameter is different .",
    "the @xmath4 compactification introduces the radius @xmath5 of the circle .",
    "this is an additional dimensionful parameter to the dynamical scale parameter @xmath6 and the combination @xmath7 is dimensionless . due to these changes",
    "the analysis of the picard - fuchs equation becomes more complicated in five dimensional theory .",
    "the appearance of dimensionless parameter makes the solution more involved and the limit @xmath8 more subtle .    in section 2 ,",
    "the picard - fuchs equation is derived from the spectral curve of the relativistic toda system .",
    "we check that the perturbative part of the effective coupling derived from our picard - fuchs equation incorporates the contribution from the kaluza - klein modes as expected .",
    "we also show that the picard - fuchs equations obtained from curves in other approaches ; the xxz spin chain and m theory viewpoint , are the same as ours .",
    "the periods are obtained by solving the picard - fuchs equation in section 3 .",
    "we express both vector multiplet @xmath9 and its dual @xmath10 as power series in the gauge invariant moduli parameter @xmath11 at @xmath12 . in section 4",
    "we establish non - linear differential equations for the moduli parameter @xmath11 and find the prepotential @xmath13 in the weak coupling .",
    "we try to identify the instanton contribution in the non - perturbative part of the prepotential by comparing it with the prepotential @xmath14 in four dimensions .",
    "the final section is devoted to miscellaneous topics .",
    "we briefly report the prepotential in strong coupling region and give a preliminary result on the @xmath15 case .",
    "many technical informations are collected in appendices .",
    "nekrasov s proposal @xcite for the description of the moduli space of supersymmetric yang - mills gauge theory in five dimensions @xcite with one compactified direction was to use an elliptic curve arising from the hamiltonian of the relativistic toda chain .",
    "for @xmath1 the curve is given by y^2 = ( x^2 -^4 ) , where @xmath5 is the radius of a circle and @xmath11 is the moduli parameter of the five dimensional theory .",
    "in the semi - classical limit @xmath11 has an asymptotic behavior @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath9 is a vector multiplet whose scalar component has expectation value on the coulomb branch .",
    "the prepotential @xmath17 that characterizes the low energy effective action is locally a function of @xmath9 .",
    "this curve is the same as the usual @xmath1 seiberg - witten elliptic curve @xcite ( see also appendix a ) , if the moduli @xmath18 of the four dimensional theory is related with @xmath11 by u=(r^2 u^2 - ) .both the moduli parameters @xmath18 and @xmath11 have mass dimension two .",
    "the elliptic curve ( [ eli ] ) has four branching points x_1 = -^2 ,  x_2 = ^2 ,  x_3 = -+ ,  x_4 = .with the identification ( [ uu ] ) these branching points correspond to those of the seiberg - witten curve .",
    "thus the @xmath19- and @xmath20-cycles are taken as loops going around counterclockwise as follows :  x_1 x_2 , :  x_2 x_3 .then the intersection number is @xmath21 .",
    "the periods are defined by the integral over these cycles of the holomorphic one form @xmath22 on the curve . according to seiberg and witten",
    "@xcite we should identify the periods as : = _ , : = _ , where @xmath10 is a dual vector multiplet .",
    "we have chosen the numerical factor so that these periods may be identified with those of the four dimensional theory after the replacement ( [ uu ] ) .",
    "namely , we observe the following basic relation to the pure @xmath1 seiberg - witten theory = , = .though @xmath9 and @xmath10 are obtained in principle from integration over @xmath11 of ( [ peri ] ) or contour integral of @xmath23 to be introduced right now , ( [ aa ] ) is useful for later discussion .",
    "the five dimensional analogue of the seiberg - witten one - form can be obtained from integration of @xmath22 over @xmath11 .",
    "up to a total derivative term , this is given by _",
    "swn= dx , which we call the seiberg - witten - nekrasov one - form .",
    "it is also a characteristic one - form in the hamiltonian dynamics of the relativistic toda system @xcite .",

    ".      the most useful tool to study the moduli space of the coulomb branch would be the picard - fuchs equation for the periods . in four dimensions ,",
    "this method was widely used for many cases , e.g. , for the @xmath24 gauge theories @xcite and some algorithms to get a closed form of picard - fuchs equation were developed in @xcite .",
    "this method is also available for five dimensional case .",
    "the picard - fuchs equation to be derived below is the first example for five dimensional susy gauge theory .",
    "we can easily find that the period integrals in ( [ peri ] ) satisfy the following picard - fuchs equation + - = 0 , where @xmath25 for a one - cycle @xmath26 .",
    "( u)=-1 + 4 ^ 4 + 2r^4 u^2 -r^8 u^4 is the discriminant of ( [ eli ] ) and hereafter we will often use a dimensionless combination @xmath27 .",
    "note that ( [ pf ] ) is invariant under the sign reflection @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "by ( [ uu ] ) @xmath29 can be transformed into ( u(u))=4r^4 ( ^4 -u^2 ) , which is just the discriminant of the seiberg - witten curve .",
    "similarly we can see a relation between ( [ pf ] ) and the picard - fuchs equation in four dimensions .",
    "in fact , with the help of ( [ aa ] ) we find that by the change of variables @xmath30 , ( [ pf ] ) is reduced to = 0 .then we can integrate once to obtain the @xmath1 picard - fuchs equation in four dimensions .",
    "we note that in terms of the moduli @xmath11 of five dimensional theory ( [ pf ] ) is never total derivative and it can not be reduced to the second order equation for @xmath31 .",
    "we can see that the picard - fuchs equation ( [ pf ] ) incorporates the contribution of the ( perturbative ) kaluza - klein modes of the @xmath4 compactification by examining the perturbative effective coupling @xmath32 .",

    "n=1^ , to the perturbative effective coupling @xmath32 .",
    "we have discarded an infinite term in this manipulation .",
    "such a divergence could appear , since we formally turned off the scale parameter @xmath6 that plays a role of a cut off in perturbative calculation .",
    "we have derived the picard - fuchs equation ( [ pf ] ) from the elliptic curve ( [ eli ] ) and its periods , but the same differential equation can be obtained from the spectral curve and associated one - form of integrable system ; xxz spin chain which includes a relativistic toda chain as a particular limit @xcite .",
    "moreover , the curves of the same type have been shown to be obtained from the susy cycles in compactified @xmath2 theory @xcite .",
    "for integrable ( periodic ) spin chain with @xmath38-sites the spectral curve is defined by  ( t_n ( ) - z ) = 0 , where @xmath39 is the @xmath40 transfer ( monodromy ) matrix .",
    "thus , we obtain a complex curve z^2 - 2p_n ( ) z + q_2n ( ) = 0 , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . according to @xcite ,",
    "pure gauge theory should be regarded as a degenerating limit of the model with massive matter described by the xxz spin chain . in our notation and normalization",
    "the spectral curve for @xmath43 pure gauge theory is z^2 + 2zx^n_c /2 _ i=1^n_cr ( v - a_i ) + ^2n_c = 0 , where @xmath44 and @xmath45 . defining z+ = - p_n_c ,",
    "z- = - y , with p_n_c=(x^n_c++(-1)^n_c ) , we obtain a hyperelliptic curve ; y^2 = p_n_c^2 -()^2n_c .in the case of @xmath46 , this is elliptic ; y^2 = ( x^2 + s x+1)^2 -4 ^ 4 , where @xmath47 . for the @xmath43 theory coupled with massless @xmath48",
    "matter hypermultiplets , the curve takes the form z^2 + 2zx^n_c /2 _ i=1^n_cr ( v - a_i ) + ^2n_c -n_f x^n_f /2 = 0 .as we have remarked these curves also arise as the susy cycles in @xmath2 theory compactification .    for a period integral @xmath49 along a 1-cycle @xmath26 , the picard - fuchs equation for ( [ su2c ] )",
    "is easily deduced to be + + = 0 , where ( s)=16 - 64 ^ 4 -8s^2 + s^4 .([pppp ] ) is identical to ( [ pf ] ) under the identification s=-2r^2 u .",
    "therefore , both of the complex curves based on the spin chain model and on @xmath2 theory give the same picard - fuchs equation as the one we have derived in sect 2.2 .",
    "we note that ( [ su2c ] ) can be converted to the hyperelliptic curve in four dimensions ^2 = ( ^2 -u)^2 -^4 by the transformation r = x+ ,  y=2r^2 ,   2r^2 u=-1 , where the third equation with ( [ rela ] ) implies ( [ uu ] ) .",
    "however , this isomorphism breaks down when hypermultiplets are introduced .",
    "for example , let us consider the @xmath1 theory with a massless hypermultiplet ( the flavor index @xmath50 ) . then the hyperelliptic curve derived in the @xmath2 theory approach",
    "can be written in the form @xcite y^2 = ( x^2 + s x+1)^2 -(r)^3 ( x-1 ) , where we are not careful with the numerical factor for @xmath51 because it can be absorbed by rescaling of variables . however",
    ", this curve can not be reduced to the corresponding massless @xmath1 curve in four dimensions even if we apply a transformation like ( [ 229 ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "the isomorphism via the simple transformation of variables between the curves of the five and four dimensional theories is valid only for pure gauge theories . for the models including hypermultiplets",
    ", we have to compare physics from spectral curves of integrable systems and hyperelliptic curves of @xmath2 theory further .",
    "this would tell us which curve we should use .",
    "finally , we comment a little more on ( [ su2 m ] ) .",
    "if ( [ su2 m ] ) is rewritten as y^2 = ( ^2 -u)^2 -^3 ( --1 ) by the transformation = x+ ,  u=-1 , ( [ su2 mm ] ) is reminiscent of the curve of massive @xmath1 @xmath50 theory in four dimensions @xcite with a `` mass '' of @xmath52 and the `` qcd scale parameter '' @xmath53 .",
    "of course , since the mass of the hypermultiplet and the moduli are different object , we can not actually interpret ( [ su2 mm ] ) as the massive curve in four dimensions .",
    "however , the reader might recall that there was a similar phenomenon in the @xmath54 gauge theory in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "there , the @xmath54 curve looked like the @xmath15 curve coupled with two massive hypermultiplets with equal mass .",
    "we do not know what it means , but it may imply that the moduli spaces of such different theories can be connected in a sense .",
    "since the picard - fuchs equation ( [ pf ] ) is essentially a second order differential equation , if we solve it for @xmath55 , ( [ pf ] ) can be easily solved by the frobenius method . in order to compare the results of the five dimensional theory with those of the corresponding four dimensional theory , we want to solve it in the weak coupling limit . as is easy to see , from the relation ( [ uu ] ) , the weak coupling regime of @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath56 , corresponds to @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we have the following two solutions around @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) : _ 1 ( z)&=&z_i=0^a_i z^i , + _ 2 ( z)&=&_1 ( z)z+z_i=1^ b_i z^i , where the first several expansion coefficients are & & a_0 = 1 , + & & a_2 = , + & & a_4 = , + & & a_6 = , + & & a_8 = , + & & a_10= , + & & a_12= , + & & a_14= and & & b_2 = , + & & b_4 = , + & & b_6 = , + & & b_8 = , + & & b_10= , + & & b_12= , + & & b_14= . we note that @xmath59 due to the invariance under @xmath28 .",
    "the period integrals ( [ peri ] ) are given by some linear combinations of the fundamental solutions @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "lower order expansion fixes the combination to be = _ 1 , = i ( ) _ 1 - i _ 2 .we must further integrate by @xmath11 in order to obtain @xmath9 and @xmath10 . first , let us consider @xmath9 .",
    "integration over @xmath11 gives a&=&+ du + & = & 2 r^2 + u -- ( + ) - ( + ) + & & -(++ ) - , where we have identified the integration constant with @xmath62 , because the direct calculation of @xmath9 reads a&=&__swn + & = & _ -^2^^2 dx + & = & 2r^2 + u - - .it is easy to find that @xmath63-independent terms in ( [ tte ] ) are originated from the expansion of @xmath64 for large @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , it follows that a=(r^2 u+ ) - -- ( + ) - .",
    "we expect that the remaining @xmath63-dependent terms may be deduced from expansion of some simple functions , but we could not find such expressions .",
    "similarly , we can find the asymptotic behavior of @xmath65 ~i .integration over @xmath11 gives the leading part of @xmath10 and it is represented by using di - logarithm ( see appendix d ) , but the explicit form is not so simple and elegant , so we do not give it here .",
    "we do not need to include a integration constant in the expansion of @xmath10 , because it has no effect on prepotential or monodromy .",
    "note that the integration constant term corresponds to a linear term in the prepotential .",
    "since the periods are determined , their monodromy can be now obtained by leading terms a&=&2r^2 + u - , + a_d & = & ia -i(2r^2 ) u -i^2 u + .then the monodromy @xmath66 around @xmath57 transforms these periods into a & & a+i , + a_d&&a_d -8a - i + .thus the monodromy matrix is given by (    c a_d + a + 1/r    ) (    ccc 1&-8 & m + 0&1&i + 0&0&1    ) (    c a_d + a + 1/r    ) , where @xmath67 .    for completeness ,",
    "let us consider the strong coupling region .",
    "the strong coupling region in four dimensions is located at @xmath68 where a magnetically charged particle and a dyon become massless , respectively , but in this five dimensional theory the corresponding singularities in the moduli space are splitted into u_+^:= , u_-^:= , respectively ( see also figure 1 ) .",
    "let us consider a singularity corresponding to @xmath69 . in this case",
    ", we may take either @xmath70 or @xmath71 , but we take the former . by a similar discussion to the weak coupling case , the periods in the strong coupling regime can be easily found .",
    "however , since the solutions to the picard - fuchs equation are represented by a series with lengthy expansion coefficients , we consider equivalent expressions which can be deduced from the periods in four dimensional theory in the strong coupling regime ( recall that the periods are related in the sense of ( [ aa ] ) ) .",
    "the result is ( @xmath72 ) : & = & i_n=0^_n ( n+1)^n , + & = & + & & -_n=0^ ^n , where _ n & = & ( -1)^n , + _ n & = & _",
    "n .furthermore , @xmath73 is the pochhammer s symbol and @xmath74 is the polygamma function . precisely speaking",
    ", we should expand these expressions around @xmath75 .",
    "integration over @xmath11 provides the periods in the strong coupling regime and then the monodromy at @xmath76 is calculated from the asymptotic property a_d & = & ( u - u_+^+ ) + , + a&= & a_d ( u - u_+^+ ) + .thus the monodromy matrix is given by (    c a_d + a + 1/r    ) (    ccc 1&0&0 + -1&1&0 + 0&0&1    ) (    c a_d + a + 1/r    ) .we note that in contrast with the weak coupling case , @xmath77 does not mix with the monodromy of @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the strong coupling .",
    "by the basic relation of special geometry ; a_d =  , _ 5 =   , the prepotential @xmath78 in five dimensions can be obtained by integrating either @xmath10 or @xmath79 over @xmath9 after expressing them as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "hence , our first task is to find an inversion of the relation @xmath80 obtained in the last section .",
    "this inversion requires some technical care and we take the following manner .",
    "recall that in the four dimensional theory similar inversion of period was proceeded by solving a differential equation for the moduli @xcite .",
    "also for the case at hand , we can find the required relation @xmath81 by solving a non - linear differential equation for @xmath11 as follows .",
    "let u = u(a),u = u ( a ) , then by the relation of period integrals ( [ aa ] ) we have = u , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the second and third order derivatives are then given by u ",
    "= r^2 u , u=r^2 ( + r^2 u^2 ) .",
    "we also have the following relation ; = ( u)^-1  , = - ( u)^-3 u   , = 3 ( u)^-5 u^2 - ( u)^-4 u  , substituting ( [ 51 ] ) , ( [ mat ] ) and ( [ 55 ] ) into the picard - fuchs equation for @xmath9 , we get u u -3u",

    ".    we can now solve ( [ mat2 ] ) , but we must take into account of an `` initial condition '' . note that from ( [ 315 ] ) @xmath9 is asymptotically a~(r^2 u+ ) , or u~2ra",
    ".this means that we should solve ( [ mat2 ] ) by assuming u = ( q+)+ _ n=1^c_n ( q)^4n , (= r ) , where @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , substituting ( [ expan ] ) into ( [ mat2 ] ) , we can obtain differential equations for @xmath85 by equating the coefficients of powers in @xmath53 to zero . for higher @xmath85 ,",
    "such differential equations are very complicated in general , but we can solve it for @xmath86 .",
    "the result is u=2r a++o(^8 ) .",
    "the prepotential can be calculated by using @xmath10 ( or @xmath79 ) and ( [ uten ] ) .",

    "furthermore , though in the large radius limit @xmath89 vanishes exponentially , we can see the small radius behavior of it by considering analytic property of tri - logarithm ( see below ) .",

    "divided by the length of @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath89 vanish because of @xmath95 , thus only the cubic term of ( [ prepo ] ) survives in the decompactification limit ; .|_r=",
    "ia^3 .more generally the cubic term in the prepotential of ( uncompactified ) five dimensional susy gauge theory is identified as the intersection forms of calabi - yau manifolds in the calabi - yau compactification of @xmath2 theory @xcite .",
    "the small radius limit is obtained as follows ; let us denote the leading part of @xmath78 by _",

    "( [ 81 ] ) coincide with the leading part of @xmath14 if @xmath9 is identified with @xmath98 ( see below ) .",
    "in the above small radius limit , we keep only the leading terms that give rise to the one - loop prepotential in four dimensions .",

    "we will discuss the instanton contributions by a slightly different approach in the next part .",
    "we want to see how instantons contribute to the prepotential in the five dimensional theory . however , we do not know an exact expression of @xmath90 in ( [ prepo2 ] ) . to proceed",
    "we will take the following way . recall that we have normalized the relation between four and five dimensional theories such that their effective coupling constants are equivalent by ( [ aa ] ) .",

    "we have shown how the instanton corrections arise in the prepotential in five dimensions by comparing with @xmath14 . in this subsection , we give an argument to establish that @xmath78 reduces to @xmath14 ( in the weak coupling regime ) , provided the radius of @xmath4 vanishes .",
    "let us recall that @xmath105 .",
    "since @xmath78 is a twice integrated quantity over @xmath9 , it follows that _ 5 & = & ( _ 5 da)da + & = & ( _ 4 da)da .if @xmath106 can be written by @xmath98 , @xmath78 will be a function of @xmath98 .",
    "furthermore , if we take the limit @xmath96 , we will obtain some relation between @xmath78 and @xmath14 .",
    "for this purpose , however , the inversion of @xmath107 is required . from ( [ aex ] )",
    ", we observe that 2ra = a+y , where y=+o(^8 ) .",
    "thus we find a=^-1(2ra + 2ry ) . solving ( [ asin ] ) recursively in @xmath9 and expanding around @xmath108 , we can obtain a = a+(-a^3 + ) r^2 -r^3 + .therefore , = 1+z , where we have denoted miscellaneous terms depending on @xmath5 by @xmath109 , which is manifestly @xmath110 as @xmath96 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath111 as @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , the prepotential will have the form _ 5 & = & ( 1+z)da + & = & _ 4 + ( _ 4 da)zda+ ( _ 4 zda)da + ( _ 4 zda)zda .this expression shows that in the weak coupling regime , @xmath78 reduces to @xmath14 if the radius of @xmath4 vanishes ; _ 5",
    "in the last sections the expansion in the weak coupling has been worked out .",
    "the calculation in the strong coupling regime is slightly easy in contrast with the weak coupling case . repeating a similar construction as in the preceding sections by interchanging a role of @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    ", we obtain the dual prepotential by using the inversion of @xmath112 in ( [ strperi ] ) ; & = & -2ia_d - a_d^2 + ia_d^3 -a_d^4 + & & -ia_d^5 + & & + a_d^6 + .",
    "also in this case we can check ( [ adten ] ) from ( [ mat2 ] ) by exchanging @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",

    "for example , the @xmath15 curve in five dimensions takes the form y^2 = ( x^3 + s_1 x^2 + s_2 x -1)^2 -(r)^6 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are moduli @xcite . under the identification s_2 -=-r^2 u ,",
