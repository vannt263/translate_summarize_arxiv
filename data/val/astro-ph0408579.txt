    "the study of accretion dynamics of charged particles in the vicinity of a compact gravitational source is of observational as well as theoretical interest ; particularly for the information it reveals about the nature and influence of the background spacetime on the various physical processes occurring in the star s vicinity . whereas a compact star is formed largely of a degenerate plasma@xmath0 , matter surrounding the star exists in a highly ionized , though  a less dense , state@xmath1 . in this region",
    "the charged particles are more free to move while not accreted to relativistic velocities , and the dynamics of these charged particles is governed not only by the gravitational but also by the electromagnetic field of the star .",
    "however the electromagnetic field is itself  effected by the geometry of the background spacetime .",
    "therefore it is of importance and of astrophysical relevance that the two - fold effects ; namely , the coupling of the gravitational and the electromagnetic field of the star , as well as the direct effects of the background spacetime on the motion of a charged particle , must be addressed together@xmath2 .    here",
    "we present an investigation of these effects on the dynamics of an accreted  charged particle lying in the star s plasma atmosphere . to pose the problem quantitatively",
    "we consider a slowly rotating isolated compact star as the source of gravitational field which defines the geometry of the background spacetime . an axially symmetric , highly conducting plasma with a stationary , axially symmetric electromagnetic field is assumed to constitute the star s atmosphere .",
    "we regard the electromagnetic field as perturbed by the background spacetime , however the back - reaction of the electromagnetic field on the spacetime curvature is neglected and the standard kerr metric ( in its linearized form ) is used for the fixed background spacetime . for the plasma surrounding the star the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) approximation",
    "is assumed , as such the plasma is considered as an ideal highly conducting mhd fluid@xmath3 .",
    "the formulation of the electromagnetic field equations is based on a generalized definition of the electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal mhd fluid in a curved spacetime@xmath4 .",
    "the direct effects of the spacetime dragging on the particle dynamics are discussed in the gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation to the geodesic equation@xmath5 .",
    "the gem approximation , which assumes the charged particle motion to be slow , is generally valid in the case of stable compact stars ( i.e. non - collapsing objects ) .",
    "also for the case of a magnetized compact star with a dipole field the gem approximation is applicable except at or very close to the poles where particle velocities can be relativistic due to intense magnetic field .",
    "generally the accretion occurs well below the relativistic limit and so the gem approximation can be used . throughout",
    "we take the velocity four vector as defined by a comoving observer zamo ( zero angular momentum observer ) .",
    "the zamo is a useful class of observers , relevant to astrophysics , circling the gravitational source with a given angular velocity at a fixed radial distance and polar angle@xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the first part of our analysis ,",
    "comprising section ii , we obtain exact solutions of the general relativistic maxwell equations using the generalized definition of the electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal , highly conducting mhd fluid in linearized kerr spacetime .",
    "the solution obtained shows that in the slow rotation approximation the effects of rotation on the electromagnetic field are absent .",
    "then , in section iii , assuming the star to be a sphere of homogeneous mass density , we study numerically the dynamics of the charged particle using the gem approximation . in this approximation",
    "the direct effects of rotation ( i.e. via frame - dragging ) on particle trajectories are found to oppose that of the electromagnetic field , hence the particle motion is a result of balancing and counter - balancing of these effects .",
    "lastly , in section iv , we give a discussion and a summary of the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "the exterior spacetime to a slowly rotating compact gravitational source of mass @xmath7 is described by the linearized kerr metric . in the boyer - lindquist",
    "coordinates the metric can be written as the general line element :    @xmath8    where    @xmath9    and @xmath10 is the angular velocity of a free falling frame brought into rotation by the frame dragging of the spacetime . here and in what follows the greek indices run as @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "also throughout we assume the gravitational units in which @xmath13 .",
    "the general relativistic form of the maxwell equations is @xmath14@xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 represents the determinant of the metric tensor @xmath18 given by the einstein field equations . here",
    "@xmath19 is the generalized electromagnetic field tensor for an ideal mhd fluid given by a unique tensorial expression :    @xmath20    and @xmath21 is current four vector . in general the current four vector",
    "is the sum of two terms corresponding to a convection and to a conduction current :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the proper charge density , @xmath24 is the conductivity of the fluid , and @xmath25 is the unit velocity @xmath26-vector .",
    "the volume element 4-form @xmath27 and its dual @xmath28 are defined by    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the levi -civita symbol , which is @xmath31 or @xmath32 for an even , odd , or non - permutation of @xmath33 respectively .",
    "also the four vectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 , denote the electric and magnetic field components in the four dimensional spacetime . for a zamo @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath37 vanish , and using @xmath38 , the components of the four velocity vector are :    @xmath39    here we employ the often made assumption of a perfectly conducting plasma surrounding the star ( cf e.g. [ 5 ] , [ 14 ] for a discussion of this assumption with respect to the generalized ohm s law ) .",
    "since for plasma the condition of neutrality also holds thus @xmath21 must vanish identically .",
    "the maxwell equations ( 4 ) give :    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    whereas from expression ( 5 ) we obtain :    @xmath44    @xmath45    @xmath46    @xmath47      the electromagnetic field outside the plasma surrounding the compact star is now determined by equation ( 10 ) to ( 17 ) . to solve this system of equations",
    "let us assume the following separation ansatz for the magnetic field components @xmath48 and @xmath49 :    @xmath50    and similarly for the electric field components @xmath51 and @xmath52 :    @xmath53    substituting from equation ( 18 ) into equation ( 10 ) and simplifying we obtain    @xmath54    for separation we require that @xmath55 and obtain    @xmath56    and    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the separation constant . solving for @xmath59 the equation ( 21 )",
    "we obtain @xmath60 . notice that because of the exponential function the field at coincident points @xmath61 and @xmath62 is not identical .",
    "we therefore require single valued solution @xmath63 . the solutions to equations ( 21 ) and ( 22 )",
    "are now given by :    @xmath64    and    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants .",
    "therefore we have    @xmath68    where @xmath69 .",
    "and similarly from equation ( 13 ) and ( 18 ) we obtain    @xmath70    and hence    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .    now to determine the functions @xmath74 we substitute from ( 25 ) and ( 27 ) into equation ( 13 ) . after some simplification",
    "we obtain in a separated form :    @xmath75    as before we have    @xmath76    and    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is a constant",
    ". since ( 30 ) holds for every value of @xmath79 , on comparing coefficients of @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and unity we obtain @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "here are now two possibilities for non - trivial solutions depending on either @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( i.e. @xmath86 )",
    ".    for @xmath84 equation ( 29 ) gives    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is a constant . from equations ( 25 ) , ( 27 ) and ( 17 ) we obtain in a similar manner    @xmath89    hence    @xmath90    and    @xmath91    also from equations ( 11 ) , ( 12 ) and ( 15 ) , ( 16 ) we obtain    @xmath92    @xmath93    for @xmath86 ( and similarly for @xmath94 ) , there is no poloidal component to the magnetic ( electric ) field  and the only non - vanishing components to the electromagnetic field are given by equations ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) .",
    "clearly in both cases the electromagnetic field is independent of @xmath95 .    in figures ( 1 ) and ( 2 )",
    "we give plots for the magnetic ( electric ) field components @xmath49 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) for @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) and @xmath100 ( @xmath101",
    "according to the general theory of relativity the trajectory of a particle in the field of a massive object is determined by the geodesic equation :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the christoffel symbol . to linearize the geodesic equation we assume that the metric tensor can be expressed as : @xmath104 where @xmath105 @xmath106 is the minkowski metric tensor and @xmath107 is a small perturbation to the spacetime metric such that @xmath108 .",
    "we can take time @xmath109 for the affine parameter @xmath110 . further requiring @xmath111 for a ` slow ' moving particle we obtain@xmath112 @xmath113 where    @xmath114    and    @xmath115    @xmath116 being the mass density and @xmath117 is the volume of the gravitational source .",
    "this approximation , due to its formal analogy to the classical electromagnetic theory , is referred to as the gravitoelectromagnetic ( gem ) approximation to the general theory of relativity ( see reference [ 16 ] and [ 17 ] for different interpretations ) . thus in expression",
    "( 40 ) @xmath118 is called the gravitoelectric ( ge ) force per unit mass whereas the term @xmath119 is called the gravitomagnetic ( gm ) force for a unit mass . in particular the gm force , being independent of the choice of a particular coordinate system used , is general relativistically significant .    in the slow rotation approximation the deformation to the star due to the effects of rotation",
    "are small compared to the  radially attractive ge force ; hence we take the star to be a slowly rotating sphere of homogeneous mass density . then using gem analogy ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath120    and @xmath121 where @xmath7 is the mass , @xmath122 is the radius and @xmath123 is the angular velocity of the star .",
    "thus in the field of a slowly rotating compact star , the net force acting on a particle of mass @xmath124 and charge @xmath125 is the sum of the gravitational and the electromagnetic forces :    @xmath126    to specify the physical situation we study the motion of the charged particle in a cartesian coordinate system @xmath127 and take @xmath128 to be along the positive @xmath129-axis .",
    "furthermore , since now the effective component of the gm force lies in the @xmath130-plane , we assume that the @xmath130-plane is the equatorial plane of the star and the particle s motion is confined to this plane only .",
    "then for the case of non - vanishing poloidal magnetic field we transform expressions ( 33)-(36 ) and ( 42)-(43 ) into the cartesian coordinates , and obtain the equations of motion in the equatorial plane ( i. e. for @xmath61 ) :    @xmath131    @xmath132    where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . notice that here the case of vanishing poloidal magnetic field is obtained for @xmath136 whereas requiring @xmath94 does not alter the equations of motion ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) .",
    "we numerically solve the equations of motion ( 45 ) and ( 46 ) for the initial conditions @xmath137 and @xmath138 , and plot ( in figure ( 3 ) to ( 6 ) ) the solutions for various values of the parameters @xmath7 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "we have considered the dynamics of a charged particle in a highly , conducting plasma surrounding a slowly rotating compact gravitational source .",
    "the effects of background spacetime have been discussed , both directly on the particle s motion and indirectly via an axially symmetric electromagnetic field around the star .",
    "we found ( equations ( 33 ) to ( 36 ) ) that when slow rotation is assumed for the compact source the spacetime dragging does not modify or reduce the electromagnetic field of the star .",
    "hence the field remains , in this approximation , the same as for the schwarzchild spacetime .",
    "however the motion of the particle is directly influenced via gravitational field of the star .",
    "our numerical analysis of the effects of gravitational and electromagnetic field shows ( fig .",
    "( 3 )  to ( 6 ) ) that whereas the electromagnetic effects dominate the overall dynamics of the charged particle at sufficiently large distances , the gravitational field also becomes important closer to the surface of the star especially if the star is rotating fast enough .",
    "firstly we observe that the effects of the electric field is to lift a charge particle from close to the surface of the star ( fig .",
    "( 3 ) ) and make them move along the magnetic field lines . here",
    "are now two possibilities : one , if the magnitude of the magnetic field is larger than the magnitude of the electric field the particle following a helical trajectory falls into the star ( case ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in fig . ( 4 ) ) ; two , if the magnetic field strength is weaker or is even comparable to the electric field strength , then the electrical effects become dominant and the particle escapes from falling into the star ( case ( d ) , and ( e ) in fig.(4 ) ) .    on the other hand",
    "the effects of gravitational field can be regarded as opposing that of the electromagnetic field . in figure ( 5 ) we notice thatthe ge force attracts the particle towards the star s surface against the electric field . furthermore it is clear from figure ( 6 ) that the gyroradius of the helical trajectory of the particle is increased due to the gm force ; hence the gm force weakens the effects of the magnetic field .    summing up these observations",
    "we note that the accretion of a charged particle in vicinity of a compact star is mainly due to the ge and magnetic effects .",
    "these effects are especially dominant at a sufficiently large distances from the star . however _ close _ to the star the particle trajectory is also effected by the gm force as well as electric field which cause accerted charged particles to follow open lines of force . for a sufficiently fast rotating star and an electric field comparable to the magnetic field the above mechanism ( gm + electric ) may contribute to opposing the in - fall of the plasma surrounding the compact star ."
