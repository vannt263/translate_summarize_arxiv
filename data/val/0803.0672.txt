    "supersymmetry is currently the most - studied extension of the standard model  ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it provides solutions to some profound theoretical problems of the standard model : the fine tuning of the higgs mass , the ( non-)unification of gauge couplings , a mechanism for spontaneous symmetry breaking , and a cold dark matter candidate .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is based on a two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) with five physical higgs bosons : two cp - even @xmath0 , one cp - odd @xmath1 ( also named the `` pseudo - scalar '' higgs ) , and two charged scalars @xmath2 .",
    "each particle of this 2hdm receives a susy partner of opposite spin - statistics , where left- and right - handed components of a standard model dirac fermion are attributed with separate scalars @xmath3 which mix to the physical mass eigenstates @xmath4 .",
    "compared to the standard model , the mssm higgs sector is described by two additional parameters , usually chosen to be the pseudo - scalar mass @xmath5 and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath6 .",
    "the masses of the other higgs bosons are then fixed by susy constraints .",
    "in particular , the mass of the light cp - even higgs boson , @xmath7 , is bounded from above . at tree - level , it is @xmath8 .",
    "radiative corrections to the higgs pole masses raise this bound substantially to values that were inaccessible by lep  @xcite .",
    "the large numerical impact is due to a contribution @xmath9 coming from top- and stop quark loops ( @xmath10 is the top quark mass and @xmath11 is proportional to the top yukawa coupling ) .",
    "the one - loop corrections to the higgs pole masses are known without any approximations  @xcite .",
    "they show that the bulk of the numerical effects can be obtained in the so - called effective - potential approach in the limit of vanishing external momentum .",
    "motivated by this observation , all presumably relevant two - loop terms have since been evaluated in this approach ( for reviews , see e.g.refs.@xcite ) .",
    "more recently there has been quite some activity in the context of the mssm with complex parameters which can lead to sizeable effects ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the two - loop results are implemented in the numerical programs feynhiggs  @xcite and cpsuperh  @xcite using on - shell particle masses , and in softsusy  @xcite , spheno  @xcite , and suspect  @xcite using @xmath12 parameters , that is , dimensional reduction with minimal subtraction .",
    "the influence of terms that go beyond the approximation of vanishing external momentum has been investigated in ref.@xcite .",
    "based mostly on the renormalization scale and scheme dependence , the theoretical uncertainty on the prediction of the light higgs boson mass @xmath7 has been estimated to 3 - 5gev  @xcite .",
    "this is to be compared with the expected experimental uncertainty of a higgs mass measurement at the lhc of the order of 100 - 200  mev  @xcite . at an international linear collider",
    ", this goes even down to roughly 50  mev  @xcite .",
    "these numbers clearly show the need for three - loop corrections to the susy higgs bosons masses in order to fully exploit the physics potential of these colliders .",
    "in fact , quite recently the leading and next - to - leading logarithmic terms in @xmath13 at three - loop level have been obtained , where @xmath14 is the typical scale of susy particle masses  @xcite . in this letter , we want to present the first genuine three - loop calculation of the lightest higgs boson mass , focusing on a few simplifying limiting cases for the sake of brevity .",
    "in particular , we consider effects of order @xmath15 , keep only the leading terms @xmath16 , and neglect all mixing effects in the stop sector .",
    "more general results and their detailed phenomenological impacts shall be deferred to a later publication .",
    "at tree - level , the mass matrix of the neutral , cp - even higgs bosons @xmath17 , @xmath18 has the following form : @xmath19 the diagonalization of @xmath20 gives the tree - level result for @xmath7 and @xmath21 , and leads to the well - known bound @xmath22 which is approached in the limit @xmath23 .",
    "quantum corrections to the higgs boson masses are incorporated by evaluating the poles of the higgs boson propagator at higher orders .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the numerically dominant contributions can be obtained in the approximation of zero external momentum ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) which we will adopt in the following .",
    "furthermore , we will only consider corrections of order @xmath15 .",
    "apart from the quark , squark , and gluino masses , there is another parameter with mass dimension , the trilinear coupling of the soft susy breaking terms , @xmath24 . before renormalization",
    ", we express it through the stop masses @xmath25 , @xmath26 , the stop mixing angle @xmath27 , and the bilinear higgs parameter @xmath28 as follows : @xmath29    the mass matrix @xmath30 is obtained from the quadratic terms in the higgs boson potential constructed from the fields @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "they are related to the physical higgs mass eigenstates via a mixing angle @xmath33 . since @xmath31 does not couple directly to top quarks",
    ", it is convenient to perform the calculations of the feynman diagrams in the @xmath34 basis .    including higher order corrections , one obtains the higgs boson mass matrix @xmath35 which again gives the physical higgs boson masses upon diagonalization .",
    "the renormalized quantities @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are obtained from the self energies of the fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath1 , evaluated at zero external momentum , as well as from tadpole contributions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "let us remark that if one sets @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and evaluates only the leading contribution @xmath41 , then only @xmath42 and the matrix @xmath43 is diagonal .",
    "on the other hand , if we allow for non - zero @xmath24 , also @xmath36 and @xmath38 contribute in general .",
    "the calculation of @xmath37 is organized as follows : all feynman diagrams are generated with qgraf  @xcite . in order to properly take into account the majorana character of the gluino , the output",
    "is subsequently manipulated by a perl script which applies the rules given in ref .",
    "the various diagram topologies are identified and transformed to form  @xcite with the help of q2e and exp  @xcite .",
    "the program exp is also used in order to apply the asymptotic expansion ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the various mass hierarchies .",
    "the actual evaluation of the integrals is performed with the package matad  @xcite , resulting in an expansion in @xmath44 for each diagram , where @xmath45 is the space - time dimension .",
    "the total number of three - loop diagrams amounts to about 16,000 .    at three - loop level",
    "we need to renormalize the top quark mass , the top squark mass , and the stop mixing angle at the two - loop order .",
    "in addition , the one - loop counterterm of the gluino mass is needed for the renormalization of the two - loop expression .",
    "we implement dimensional reduction ( dred ) with the help of the so - called @xmath46-scalars which appear for the first time at two loops .",
    "the renormalization of the @xmath46-scalar mass is performed in the on - shell scheme , requiring that the renormalized mass is equal to zero . in the literature",
    "this is referred to as @xmath47@xmath48 scheme .",
    "the one - loop on - shell counterterms are well - known ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "as far as the two - loop counterterms for the squarks and quarks are concerned , one can find the results in refs .",
    "however , it is rather tedious to extract the results for the mass hierarchies we are interested in .",
    "thus , we re - computed the corresponding corrections .    to our knowledge ,",
    "the two - loop counterterm for the stop mixing angle is not yet available in the literature .",
    "it turns out that in our approximation , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 , only the one - loop counterterm of the mixing angle enters the three - loop result .    as a cross check for our calculation",
    ", we recalculated the exact two - loop result ( in the limit of vanishing external momentum ) and find perfect agreement with the literature  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the expansion of the exact expressions confirms the limiting cases discussed below .",
    "both the two- and three - loop calculations are performed for a general qcd gauge parameter @xmath49 .",
    "the independence of the final results on @xmath49 serves as another welcome check on the correctness of our result .",
    "we use anti - commuting @xmath50 which is allowed for fermion traces which involve an even number of @xmath50 matrices .",
    "it turns out that all traces involving an odd number of @xmath50 vanish because they contain less than four gamma matrices .    in the following we discuss three different cases for the mass hierarchy . in all cases we set the light quark masses to zero .",
    "\\(i ) _ supersymmetric limit _ , i.e. , @xmath51 and the gluino and other squarks are massless : @xmath52 .",
    "the quantum corrections to the higgs boson mass vanish in this case , as required by supersymmetry . still , the individual diagrams are different from zero and thus the calculation imposes a strong check on our setup .",

    "as is well known , the one - loop corrections are large , increasing @xmath7 by up to @xmath87  gev .",
    "the two - loop effects are negative , reducing the size of the overall corrections by about 30% with respect to the one - loop result .",
    "the three - loop terms are much smaller and clearly stabilize the perturbative behaviour . at @xmath67 , for example , they lead to a further reduction of @xmath82 by about @xmath88  mev for @xmath89  gev and an enhancement of about 500   for @xmath90  tev .",
    "note that the numerical impact is larger than the precision on the lightest higgs boson mass as expected at the lhc .    in order to estimate the size of the higher order corrections , we consider the dependence of the result on the choice of the renormalization scale . in fig .",

    "the dependence of the three - loop result on the renormalization scale indicates that the residual theoretical uncertainty matches the expected accuracy for a higgs mass measurement at lhc and possibly even at a future linear collider .    it remains to say that the calculational setup which was used to obtain the results of this paper is not restricted to the specific mssm parameter points considered here .",
