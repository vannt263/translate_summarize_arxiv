    "the chemical composition of very metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath4 = @xmath5 , and @xmath6 for elements a and b. ] ) stars is expected to be determined by a small number of nucleosynthesis events that preceded the formation of these objects , while that of metal - rich stars like the sun are the result of the accumulated stellar yields throughout the long history of the galaxy . in recent years , abundance studies of heavy elements in very metal - poor stars have provided quite important constraints on models of the astrophysical neutron - capture processes , both the @xmath7low - process and the @xmath2apid - process .",
    "discoveries of @xmath2-process - element - enhanced , very metal - poor stars , and their subsequent abundance analyses , have shown that the abundance pattern of neutron - capture elements with @xmath8 agrees very well with the @xmath2-process component abundances in solar - system material ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results suggest that the abundance pattern of the @xmath2-process component in the solar system for @xmath9 is not the result of a mixture of quite different abundance patterns produced by individual processes , but rather , that the patterns produced by individual processes are quite similar throughout galactic history .    by way of contrast ,",
    "the abundances of light _",
    "r_-process elements ( @xmath10 ) of these objects are known to show a deviation from the @xmath2-process component in the solar system .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the abundances of neutron - capture elements , including six elements with @xmath11 , of cs  22892052 in detail , and found a clear deviation from the scaled solar - system @xmath2-process component , especially for y , rh , and ag .",
    "they concluded that different _",
    "r_-process sites may be responsible for the formation of the lighter ( @xmath11 ) and heavier ( @xmath12 ) neutron - capture elements .",
    "a phenomenological model for these results was proposed by @xcite .",
    "in addition to the above studies of the _ total _ abundances of neutron - capture elements , analyses of isotope fractions for individual elements are also quite important for making detailed comparison with predictions from theoretical models for the @xmath2-process .",
    "europium is one of the elements which have comparatively large isotope shifts between the spectral lines of individual components ( @xmath0eu and @xmath1eu ) .",
    "@xcite carried out an analysis of the eu isotope fractions for three @xmath2-process - element - enhanced metal - poor stars , and showed that the fractions of @xmath0eu and @xmath1eu are 0.5 , agreeing with that of solar - system material .",
    "this demonstrates that , even at the isotopic level , there is agreement between the abundance pattern of _",
    "r_-process elements in very metal - poor stars with the @xmath2-process component in the solar system .",
    "on the other hand , the extremely @xmath2-process - element - enhanced , very metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath13 ) star cs  31082 - 001 , first reported on by @xcite , exhibits a somewhat different abundance pattern as compared to otherwise similar stars .",
    "the abundances of heavy ( @xmath14 ) neutron - capture elements in this star are _ higher _ than would be predicted from the abundances of elements with @xmath15 , when the scaled solar - system @xmath2-process component pattern is extended to the third @xmath2-process peak @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the site and/or conditions under which @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis of ( at least ) the heavy neutron - capture elements occurs are not unique , but have some star - to - star variation .",
    "the theoretical implications of cs  31082 - 001 have been considered in detail by @xcite , wanajo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and schatz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "the agreement of the abundance pattern of cs  31082 - 001 with that of the solar - system @xmath2-process component only appears to be valid in the range @xmath16 .",
    "one open question at this stage is whether the isotope ratios , such as @xmath0eu/@xmath1eu , agree with those of other @xmath2-process - element - enhanced stars , as well as with that of the solar - system material . in this paper , we report the isotope fractions of eu derived for three stars , cs  31082 - 001 , cs  22892 - 052 and hd  115444 , based on high - resolution spectra obtained with the subaru telescope and the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds , noguchi et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the latter two objects have already been studied by @xcite , but for comparison purposes we have carried out an independent analysis using new spectra with higher resolution than were previously available .",
    "observations were carried out with the hds of the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "the detector is a mosaic of two 4k @xmath17 2k eev - ccd s with 13.5  @xmath18 m pixels . besides cs  31082 - 001 , we observed two other @xmath2-process - element - enhanced metal - poor stars , cs  22892 - 052 @xcite and hd  115444 @xcite .",
    "these two objects have already been studied by @xcite , and are quite useful for comparison purposes .",
    "details of the observations are provided in table [ tab : obs ] . while the spectra of cs  22892 - 052 and hd  115444 were taken with a resolving power @xmath19 , cs  31082 - 001",
    "was observed with somewhat lower resolution , @xmath20 , due to poor weather conditions .",
    "nevertheless , this resolving power is still sufficient for the present analysis .",
    "the s / n ratios per 0.012  pixel at 4100  are 110 , 65 , and 300 for cs  31082 - 001 , cs  22892 - 052 and hd  115444 , respectively .",
    "data reduction was performed in the standard way within the iraf environment , following procedures described by @xcite .    for future studies on the possible binarity of these objects , which will be investigated on the basis of observed radial - velocity variations , table 1",
    "also provides ( heliocentric ) radial velocities measured for our spectra .",
    "the radial velocities were measured using clean lines .",
    "the radial velocity of cs  22892 - 052 obtained in our present work is + 13.2 km  s@xmath21 , and shows no significant changes from the results of @xcite , who suggested a small variation of the radial velocity ( with a period of 120 days ) for this object .",
    "cs  31082 - 001 was observed in july and october 2001 .",
    "the results of the two measurements agree very well , and no variation of the radial velocity was found with respect to the results of @xcite .",
    "though there is no clear evidence for binarity of these objects from the above measurements , further long - term monitoring of their velocities is required to obtain any definitive conclusions .",
    "we note that our abundance analysis for cs  31082 - 001 is based only on the october 2001 spectrum , because the quality of the data is superior to that obtained in july 2001 .",
    "the eu isotope ratios were measured by fitting the observed spectra of eu lines with synthetic spectra calculated using model atmospheres @xcite including the effect of the isotope shifts .",
    "we adopted atmospheric parameters for our objects ( effective temperature : @xmath22 , surface gravity : @xmath23 , micro - turbulent velocity : @xmath24 , and metallicity , as represented by the iron abundance , [ fe / h ] ) that are similar to those in previous work : @xmath25(k ) / @xmath23 /@xmath24(kms@xmath21 ) / [ fe / h ] = 4800/1.5/1.8/@xmath26 for cs  31082 - 001 @xcite , 4750/1.3/2.3/@xmath26 for cs  22892 - 052 @xcite , and 4650/1.5/2.1/@xmath26 for hd  115444 @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that , in contrast to studies of elemental abundances , the analyses of isotope ratios are generally quite _ insensitive _ to the adopted atmospheric parameters .",
    "the effects of isotope shifts and hyperfine splitting in eu lines have been discussed by @xcite . the line list produced by @xcite , based on @xcite , was applied in the present work .",
    "@xcite analyzed the lines at 3819 , 3907 , 4129 , and 4205   .",
    "unfortunately , the 3907   line was not covered in our cs  31082 - 001 spectrum due to the gap between the two ccd s of hds .",
    "instead , we analyzed the weaker line at 4435   for cs  31082 - 001 and cs  22892 - 052 .",
    "as shown in the following analysis , this line is actually quite useful for the measurement of the isotope ratios in these extremely eu - enhanced stars , because the lines at 3819 , 4129 , and 4205   are sufficiently strong that they compromise the accuracy of the derived isotope fractions , as well as the total abundance .",
    "we note that the 4435   line in hd  115444 is too weak , hence it was not used in the analysis of this object .",
    "the 4522   line has an appropriate strength for isotopic and abundance analyses , but was not used because of severe blending with other elemental lines .",
    "the instrumental profile of hds , for spectra with resolving power higher than @xmath27 , can be well - approximated by a gaussian shape , but this does not pertain to spectra obtained with lower resolving powers @xcite . accordingly , we have employed gaussian profiles for the instrumental line broadening for calculation of the synthetic spectra of cs  22892 - 052 and hd  115444 , which were observed with @xmath19 . for the analysis of cs  31082 - 001 , which was observed with @xmath20 , we measured the instrumental profile from the th emission lines obtained for the wavelength calibration , and applied the resulting profile to the spectrum synthesis calculations .",
    "the macro - turbulence for the individual stellar atmospheres was estimated by fitting clean lines with synthetic spectra for each object , assuming gaussian profiles .",
    "this approximation should be valid since the axial rotation of these ( very old ) red giants is expected to be quite small .    in order to estimate the quality of the fit between observed and synthetic spectra , we calculated the values of reduced @xmath28 , defined as :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the difference between the observed and synthetic spectra at the @xmath31-th spectrum point .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the signal - to - noise ratio of the continuum level , and @xmath35 indicates the normalized flux at the @xmath31-th point ( @xmath36 for absorption profiles ) . in the above equation , @xmath37 is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit , and is approximately the number of data points to which the fit is applied ( 20 - 30 pixels ) .",
    "then , @xmath38 is represented as :    @xmath39    by dividing @xmath40 by @xmath41 , the dependence of the data quality on the depth of the absorption is accounted for . in this definition",
    ", @xmath38 is expected to be unity in the best - fit case for data of a given @xmath34 , because the @xmath38 value , taking the @xmath34 ratio at the line into consideration , cancels out the line - to - line and object - to - object differences in data quality . in the following presentation , however , we show the result for a fixed value of @xmath34 , in order to compare directly the goodness of the fit between individual lines .",
    "we fix the @xmath34 to be 100 , which roughly represents the @xmath34 ratio of the cs  31082 - 001 spectrum .",
    "we show examples of the observed and synthetic spectra in figure [ fig:4129a ] and [ fig:4435a ] for the 4129   and 4435   lines , respectively .",
    "we first assumed the fraction of @xmath0eu to be 0.5 , and derived the total eu abundance for each line .",
    "then we fitted the synthetic spectra to the observed ones for the longer wavelength ( redder ) part of the spectral line , which is insensitive to the assumed isotope ratio , by shifting the observed spectra .",
    "the shifts we applied are smaller than 0.01   .",
    "these are reasonable , as the uncertainties of the wavelength calibration of the spectra and the absolute wavelength of the eu lines are likely to be in error at this level .",
    "we then calculated the @xmath38 for the red portion of the line to determine the wavelength shifts .",
    "we estimated the uncertainties of the wavelength determination by taking a value where @xmath38 is twice larger than the best - fit case .",
    "we next proceeded to the determination of the eu isotope fractions , as well as the total eu abundances .",
    "we searched for the isotope fractions that resulted in the smallest @xmath38 for a given eu abundance .",
    "this analysis was carried out by changing the eu abundance in steps of 0.01  dex , and adopting the eu abundances and isotope fractions that gave the best @xmath38 .",
    "we estimated the uncertainty of the derived eu abundances by considering the range in abundance over which the @xmath38 is twice as large as the best - fit case .",
    "the errors in the isotope fractions due to the uncertainty of the total abundance of eu were estimated from the range of the isotope fractions that were allowed within the adopted abundance uncertainty . as an example of this procedure , figure  [ fig : fit ] shows the values of @xmath38 , as a function of @xmath0eu/@xmath1eu , for the 4129   line .",
    "table  [ tab : results ] lists the derived isotope fractions and the eu abundances determined by the above analysis for each line .",
    "the @xmath38 value and the fitting error ( @xmath42 ) are also given .",
    "the fitting errors given here were simply estimated as being those obtained when the @xmath38 was assumed to be twice larger than the best - fit case at the adopted eu abundance .",
    "we also estimated the errors due to the uncertainties of the adopted eu abundance , the macro - turbulent velocity , the continuum level , and the wavelength calibration of the spectrum and the position of the eu line ( see below ) . the total error ( @xmath43 )",
    "was estimated by adding , in quadrature , these errors to @xmath42 , and is also given in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "the values of @xmath38 obtained from the fits of the three eu lines in hd  115444 are much smaller than those obtained for the other two stars , which is expected due to the considerably higher s / n ratio of the spectrum of this object .",
    "the small values of @xmath44 , and the agreement of the @xmath0eu fractions derived from the three lines consider , indicate that the eu isotope fraction derived for hd  115444 is quite reliable .",
    "the average of the @xmath0eu fraction from the three lines is fr(@xmath0eu)=0.46 .",
    "we estimated the errors in our derived isotope fractions due to uncertainties in ( 1 ) macro - turbulent velocity ( @xmath45 ) , ( 2 ) wavelength calibration and line position ( @xmath46 ) , ( 3 ) continuum level of the spectrum ( @xmath47(cont ) ) , and ( 4 ) eu abundance adopted ( @xmath48 ( eu ) ) .",
    "the uncertainty of the eu abundance as well as the wavelength calibration ( or absolute line position ) have been estimated as noted above , and are @xmath49 ( eu)=0.02  dex and @xmath50=0.002   , respectively .",
    "we assumed uncertainties for the macro - turbulent velocity and the continuum level to be @xmath51  km  s@xmath21 and @xmath47(cont)=1% , respectively , for this star .",
    "these assumption are probably conservative for a spectrum with @xmath34 = 200 @xmath52 .",
    "the errors due to these uncertainties are @xmath47fr(@xmath0eu)=@xmath53 , and @xmath54 for @xmath45=+1.0  km  s@xmath21 , @xmath50=+0.002   , and @xmath47(cont)=+0.01 , respectively .",
    "the sense of the change in the derived @xmath0eu fraction with respect to the change of the total eu abundance is dependent on the line under consideration .",
    "the uncertainties in fr(@xmath0eu ) are about 0.02 for @xmath55 ( eu)=@xmath56 0.02  dex .",
    "a similar analysis was applied to the spectrum of cs  22892 - 052 .",
    "the lower @xmath34 of the spectrum of this object , as compared to that of hd  115444 , results in the larger values of @xmath38 , and the larger fitting errors .",
    "in addition , there is a difficulty in the analysis of the 3819   line .",
    "this line is quite strong  the central part of the absorption line is almost saturated . as a result , although the line _ depth _ is insensitive to the increase of the total eu abundance , the line _ width _ increases along with the eu abundance , due to the growth of weak components in the bluer part of the line to which weak @xmath0eu lines primarily contribute .",
    "this behavior is similar to that for the increase of the fraction of @xmath0eu for a given eu abundance . as a result ,",
    "the effects of the changes of the total eu abundance and the fraction of @xmath0eu are degenerate .",
    "we attempted to estimate the uncertainty of the @xmath0eu due to that of the eu abundance by the same manner as other lines , and found quite large uncertainties : @xmath47 fr(@xmath0eu)=0.15 and @xmath48(eu)=0.10  dex .",
    "for this reason , we decided to exclude this line for determination of the isotope ratio , and adopted the average of the values determined from the other three lines , fr(@xmath0eu)=0.51 , as the final result .",
    "we note that the uncertainty of the derived @xmath0eu fraction due to the uncertainty in the total eu abundance obtained from the 4129   line is rather large ( 0.09 ) .",
    "this is partly due to the strength of this line , as in the case of the 3819   line , but the poor quality of the fit to this line also contributes .",
    "the uncertainties arising from other factors are small ( @xmath57 ) , even though a larger error in the continuum determination ( @xmath47(cont)=0.02 ) was assumed for this object , taking the low @xmath34 ratio of the spectrum into consideration .      the lines in the spectrum of cs  31082 - 001 are even stronger than those in the spectrum of cs  22892 - 052 , due to the larger excesses of the @xmath2-process elements , which are boosted by about 0.4  dex relative to this star @xcite .",
    "we excluded the 3819   line from the analysis for this star , as we did in the analysis of cs  22892 - 052 .",
    "the other two lines , at 4129   and 4205   , are also quite strong .",
    "the uncertainties of fr(@xmath0eu ) due to that of the total eu abundance are 0.07 ; the most important factors arise from the total errors . in this sense ,",
    "the isotope ratio derived from the 4435   line is the most reliable , because the line strength is appropriate for the analysis of the total abundance and isotope fractions , even though the fitting error for this line is larger than for other lines .",
    "the uncertainties arising from other factors are minor .",
    "figure  [ fig : results ] shows the results for our derived @xmath0eu fractions based on each line considered ; the error bars indicate the uncertainty ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the average of the results from individual lines are 0.46 , 0.51 , and 0.44 for hd  115444 , cs  22892 - 052 and cs  31082 - 001 , respectively .",
    "the calculation , weighted by @xmath58 , alters the results by less than 0.01 .",
    "the results for hd  115444 and cs  22892 - 052 show excellent agreement with those by @xcite , who derived fr(@xmath0eu)=0.5@xmath560.1 for these objects .",
    "the dotted line in figure  [ fig : results ] indicates the @xmath0eu fraction in solar - system material ( fr(@xmath0eu)=0.478 , anders & grevesse 1989 ) . since 95% of the eu in solar - system material is expected to originate from the @xmath2-process @xcite , this ratio well represents that of the @xmath2-process component in the solar systemeu fraction of the @xmath7-process component has not been constrained by observations , @xcite predicted it to be 0.54 , similar to that of the @xmath2-process component ( 0.47 ) , based on their stellar model .",
    "for this reason , the contribution of the @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis is not estimated from the eu isotopes .",
    "however , it should be negligible in the very metal - poor stars studied here , in particular for eu . ] . the @xmath0eu fractions in our three objects , including cs  31082 - 001 ,",
    "are _ consistent with the solar - system value . _    one clear difference between the abundance pattern of cs  22892 - 052 and that of cs  31082 - 001 is the abundance ratios between the actinide and the rare - earth elements produced by @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis ( e.g. , the th / eu ratio , hill et al .",
    "this difference is speculated to arise from the variety in the ratios of the neutron - to - seed - nuclei in the @xmath2-process site which contributed to the abundances of heavy elements in these objects .",
    "theoretical studies of @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis have shown that the neutron to seed - nuclei ratio is strongly dependent on the entropy - per - baryon ratio and the electron fraction ( @xmath59 ) in the nucleosyhthesis site , as well as on the dynamic time - scale of the event .",
    "these quantities are , however , quite difficult to estimate from theoretical studies , hence numerical simulations of the @xmath2-process often treat them as free parameters .",
    "in contrast to the above , the abundance ratios of the nuclei produced by the @xmath2-process surrounding eu are expected to be insensitive to these parameters , because the nucleosynthesis paths in this mass range ( i.e. , @xmath60 150 ) are quite similar in the @xmath2-process models which predict the production of actinide nuclei , even though the abundances of the actinides show a significantly large dispersion ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this prediction is supported by the similarity in the abundance patterns of the elements with @xmath16 found in extremely metal - poor stars , as mentioned in  1 .",
    "the result of the present study , that similar @xmath0eu/@xmath1eu ratios are found even in the @xmath2-process - element - enhanced , extremely metal - poor stars with quite different th / eu ratios , is naturally explained by the above theoretical expectation . in conclusion",
    ", our analysis of the isotope shifts appearing in a few eu absorption lines shows that the eu isotope fractions in very metal - poor , r - process - enhanced stars exhibit the value expected from standard nucleosynthesis models , and that they are independent of the global abundance patterns from light to heavy r - process elements .",
    "analyses of isotope fractions for other neutron - capture elements will provide quite strong constraints on modeling of the _ r_-process nucleosynthesis .",
    "ba and pb are known to show rather large isotope shifts in their absorption lines .",
    "though the analysis for these isotopes will prove more difficult than that of eu , their isotope ratios should be sensitive to related nuclear reactions .",
    "eu isotopes , which are ( by comparison ) rather easily measured from high - resolution spectra of suitable quality , are not sensitive to these processes .",
    "we would like to note , however , that small differences might be expected if detailed nucleosynthesis processes are included .",
    "for instance , processes that occur after freeze - out of the neutron - capture elements are expected to affect the fine - structure of the abundance patterns of individual nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these effects will appear more clearly through examination of abundances at the _ isotopic _ level , though they are likely to be smoothed out at the _ elemental _ level .",
    "the typical error in modern determinations of elemental abundances is 0.10.2  dex ( @xmath612550% ) .",
    "it thus follows that , unavoidably , some dispersion ( @xmath62 25% ) _ may _ exist even in the derived abundance patterns of the neutron - capture elements with @xmath15 in @xmath2-process - element - enhanced , metal - poor stars . we stress that derived isotope ratios of @xmath2-process elements , such as eu , are almost completely free from these uncertainties , even though they are more difficult to determine and higher quality spectra are required .",
    "the difference in the mean @xmath0eu fractions between the stars cs  22892 - 052 and cs",
    "31082 - 001 is @xmath47fr(@xmath0eu)=0.07 , smaller than the uncertainty of the analysis for individual lines .",
    "the fact that the derived @xmath0eu fractions obtained from the three eu lines used in the analysis of cs  31082 - 001 are all lower than those obtained for cs  22892 - 052 may perhaps indicate a small difference of the @xmath0eu fractions between the two stars .",
    "further observational study of the eu isotopes , based on higher quality spectra , for these , and other @xmath2-process - enhanced , extremely metal - poor stars , is strongly desired .",

    "<S> we report the first measurement of the isotope fraction of europium ( @xmath0eu and @xmath1eu ) for the extremely metal - poor , @xmath2-process - enhanced star cs  31082001 , based on high - resolution spectra obtained with the subaru telescope high dispersion spectrograph . we have also obtained new measurements of this ratio for two similar stars with previous europium isotope measurements , cs  22892052 and hd  115444 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements were made using observations of the eu lines in these spectra that are most significantly affected by isotope shifts and hyperfine splitting . </S>",
    "<S> the fractions of @xmath0eu derived for cs  31082001 , cs  22892052 , and hd  115444 are 0.44 , 0.51 , and 0.46 , respectively , with uncertainties of about @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> cs  31082001 , the first star with a meaningful measurement of u outside of the solar system , is known to exhibit peculiar abundance ratios between the actinide and rare - earth elements ( e.g. , th / eu ) , ratios that are significantly different from those for other stars with large excesses of @xmath2-process elements , such as our two comparison objects . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our analysis indicates that the eu isotope ratio of cs  31082001 agrees , within the errors , with those of other @xmath2-process - enhanced objects , and with that of solar - system material . </S>"
