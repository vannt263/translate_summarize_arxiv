    "the duplication - divergence mechanism @xcite of network growth is traditionally used to model protein networks : a duplication of a node is a consequence of the duplication of the corresponding gene , and a divergence or loss of redundant links or functions is a consequence of gene mutations @xcite .",
    "general properties of the duplication - divergence growth have recently been studied for probably the simplest version of the duplication - divergence model which is the asymmetric divergence @xcite . yet",
    "even this simplest model , where links are removed with a certain probability only from the replica node , turned out to have very rich phenomenology and to reproduce the degree distribution , observed in real protein - protein networks , surprisingly well .",
    "overall , when the link removal probability is small , the network growth is not self - averaging and an average vertex degree is increasing algebraically . for larger values of the link removal probability ,",
    "the growth is self - averaging , the average degree increases very slowly or tends to a constant , and a degree distribution has a power - law tail .",
    "a natural next step in exploring properties of the duplication - divergence networks is to consider their modular structure and distribution of various subgraphs or motifs .",
    "small subgraphs are often considered building blocks of network ; densities of particular subgraphs may tell if a network belongs to a certain  superfamily ",
    "@xcite or performs specific functions @xcite .",
    "abundances of triangles and loops have been studied in the internet , random and preferential attachment networks and regular scale - free graphs @xcite .",
    "densities of small motifs and cycles centered on a vertex were considered as a function of the vertex degree and clustering coefficient in @xcite . in protein - protein networks ,",
    "highly interconnected subgraphs were found to be well - conserved in evolution @xcite and to correspond to functional protein modules in living cells @xcite .",
    "an extreme case of highly interconnected motifs are cliques , or completely connected subgraphs .",
    "cliques have been found in higher than random abundances in protein - protein networks in yeast @xcite .    in the paper",
    "we consider a generalization of duplication - divergence network growth mechanism , duplication - divergence - heterodimerization .",
    "the heterodimerization , or linking a certain number of the pairs of target and replica nodes , is essential for clustering and is observed in protein - protein networks @xcite .",
    "we show that duplication - divergence - heterodimerization produces the cliques in the number very similar to those observed in protein - protein networks .    as in our previous work @xcite",
    ", we again start with the simplest case of the completely asymmetric divergence . yet in real protein networks , apart from special cases of partially asymmetric divergence @xcite , the divergence is believed to be close to symmetric @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the asymmetric divergence results for the clique statistics as well as the previously obtained results for the network growth @xcite are qualitatively similar to those in the arbitrary divergence case , where links are removed with given probabilities both from the target and replica nodes .",
    "the paper consists of two principle parts : in the next section we derive the clique abundance distribution for the asymmetric case and compare it to the simulation and experimental results . in sec .",
    "iii we generalize these and previously obtained results for the network growth and degree distribution onto the arbitrary divergence case . a discussion and conclusion section completes the paper .",
    "protein - protein networks exhibit a distinct modular structure and contain densely linked neighborhoods or complexes ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the extreme case of densely linked complexes are cliques or completely connected sub - graphs where each vertex is connected to all other subset members . cliques of the sizes of up to 14 vertices were found in much higher than `` random '' abundance in protein binding network of yeast @xcite . yet many large cliques observed in protein networks may be artifacts of specific experimental techniques or even of misinterpretation of the experimental data .",
    "for example , there is a strong evidence that all cliques of order higher than six in the yeast interaction network @xcite considered in @xcite result from the `` matrix '' recording of the experimental data from the mass - spectrometry experiments . in such experiments an immunoprecipitation is used to isolate stable protein complexes .",
    "usually a single protein is used as a target for the antibody ; binding of the antibody to this protein leads to an isolation of the the entire complex .",
    "however , the precise pairwise binding between proteins in the complexes strictly speaking remains undefined if a complex contains more than two proteins . yet in the  matrix  interpretation of the mass - spectrometry experiment all possible pairwise interactions between proteins in the complex are usually recorded .",
    "a well - known example of such erroneous recording is the anaphase - promoting complex .",
    "it is reported as a 11-node clique in three different mass - spectrometry high - throughput interaction surveys of yeast genome and in the mips database @xcite .",
    "the biggest reported clique in yeast network , saga / tfiid complex @xcite , is also the result of erroneous `` matrix '' recording of the data from a co - immunoprecipitation experiment described in @xcite .",
    "however , a virtually free of subjective interference two - hybrid method , used to determine the protein binding network of fruit fly @xcite , yields also higher than  random  number of cliques .",
    "specifically , the fly dataset contains 1405 triads , 35 4-cliques and one 5-clique , while a randomly re - wired graph of fly dataset contains only 1147 triads and 8 4-cliques @xcite . here and below , the lower - oder cliques that comprise the higher - order ones ( each clique with @xmath0 vertices or ",
    "@xmath0-clique  consists of @xmath0 cliques with @xmath1 vertices which can be obtained by eliminating one of the @xmath0 vertices ) are counted along with the non - trivial cliques .",
    "the number of only non - trivial cliques is slightly lower ; the fly dataset contains 1297 non - trivial triads , 30 4-cliques and one 5-clique .",
    "is such high concentration of large cliques caused by an evolutionary pressure that specifically favors big cliques , or by some stochastic mechanism of network evolution ?",
    "evidently , a simple duplication - divergence network growth never produces even a single triad as new duplicates are never linked to their ancestors @xcite .",
    "random mutations , or re - wiring of some links will give rise to a certain number of cliques , yet their abundance will be much less than the experimentally observed one @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite it was concluded that links between paralogs ( or recently duplicated pairs of proteins ) are significantly more common than if such links appeared by random mutations .",
    "most of these paralogous links are formed when a self - interacting protein or ( homodimer ) is duplicated @xcite , thus giving rise to a pair of interacting heterodimers . while after divergence certain pairs of heterodimers loose their ability to interact , some paralogs retain their propensity to heterodimerize . in the following",
    "we show that the simple duplication - divergence network growth complimented with heterodimerization of some pairs of duplicates does explain the observed abundance of cliques without invoking any evolutionary pressure .",
    "the duplication - divergence - heterodimerization process consists of duplication - divergence , previously introduced in @xcite ,    * * duplication*. a randomly chosen target node is duplicated , that is its replica is introduced and connected to each neighbor of the target node . *",
    "* divergence*. each link emanating from the replica is activated with probability @xmath2 ( this mimics link disappearance during divergence ) .    and",
    "heterodimerization ,    * * heterodimerization*. the target and replica nodes are linked with probability @xmath3 .",
    "it mimics the probability that the target node is a dimer and the propensity for dimerization is preserved during divergence .",
    "similarly to the  pure  duplication - divergence growth @xcite , the replica is preserved if at least one link is established ; otherwise the attempt is considered as a failure and the network does not change .",
    "let us first consider an evolution of population of triads , or 3-cliques .",
    "two processes that give rise to new triads are illustrated in figs .",
    "[ triada],[triadb ] . during the first process a target vertex 1 , initially linked to the vertices 2 and 3 ,",
    "is duplicated to produce a new vertex 4 .",
    "the resulting pair of duplicates 1 and 4 have a probability @xmath3 to be linked .",
    "in addition , links 4 - 2 and 4 - 3 are inherited with the probability @xmath4 each . as a result of this process , two new triads 1 - 4 - 2 and 1 - 4 - 3 are formed , each with probability @xmath5 .     a sketch of duplication event when a new triad is formed with a heterodimerization link .",
    "solid lines correspond to the existing links , dotted line is a heterodimerization link , established with the probability @xmath3 , and dashed lines denote the inherited with probability @xmath4 links . ]     a sketch of duplication event when a new triad is formed by duplicating the existing one .",
    "solid lines correspond to the existing links and dashed lines denote the links , each inherited with the probability @xmath4 . ]    in the second process ( fig .",
    "[ triadb ] ) a new triad is produced from the existing one when one of its vertices ( vertex 1 ) is duplicated .",
    "the new triad is formed only if both links , 4 - 2 and 4 - 3 survive divergence , which happens with the probability @xmath6 .",
    "correspondingly , a rate equation for the increase in the number of triads @xmath7 per duplication - divergence - heterodimerization step contains two terms , @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the numbers of links and vertices in the network .",
    "the fraction @xmath11 in the first term is an average number of links picked up for a potential triad ( which is also equal to the average degree @xmath12 ) .",
    "the factor 3 in the second term indicates that each of the three vertices in the existing triad can be picked up as a target vertex for duplication .",
    "considering links as 2-cliques , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ tri ] ) can be interpreted as describing a creation of 3-clique from a lower - order 2-clique .",
    "it is easy to see that with such interpretation , the eq .",
    "( [ tri ] ) can be generalized to describe the evolution of population of cliques of an arbitrary order , @xmath13 here @xmath14 is an increment in the number of vertices per duplication step . in the following we focus on a biologically - relevant regime of @xmath15 where the average degree @xmath16 is constant or almost constant @xcite . in this regime @xmath17 , and assuming scaling for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , one obtains a recurrent relation for the rescaled @xmath0-clique abundance , @xmath20 for large @xmath0 the second term in denominator becomes subdominant , @xmath21 it follows that the relative population of large cliques decays faster than exponentially .",
    "this rends large cliques highly improbable in networks of biologically relevant size of @xmath22 .    to check this analytical prediction and to see if the proposed duplication - divergence - heterodimerization model explains the observed population of cliques , we performed the following numerical simulation .",
    "as in @xcite , we fix @xmath23 so that the average degree is equal to that of the fly dataset , where @xmath24 for @xmath25 proteins @xcite . we select @xmath26 so that the number of triads in the simulated network is also similar to that in the fly dataset and count the number of 4- and 5-cliques in the resulting network .",
    "the theoretical @xmath18 are computed for the same @xmath4 and @xmath3 taking into account that @xmath27 .",
    "results of simulations @xmath28 averaged over 2000 network realizations , the computed @xmath29 , and the clique abundances in the fly dataset @xmath30 are shown in table  [ tab_cliques ] .",
    ".[tab_cliques ] number of @xmath0-cliques in networks with @xmath25 vertices and @xmath31 links for @xmath30  fruit fly protein - protein binding network , @xmath28  simulations with @xmath23 and @xmath26 , and @xmath29  eq .",
    "( [ cj ] ) prediction for the same @xmath4 and @xmath3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for symmetric divergence , we measure the number of components and the size of the largest component for the networks grown with various @xmath32 .",
    "the results for the networks of the size of fruit fly dataset , @xmath25 , are presented in table  [ tab_comp ] .",
    "it follows that for @xmath33 the grown network consists of many fairly small components , while for @xmath34 there is usually one or few large components and several small ones .",
    "intuitively it is clear that if the average degree grows , even slowly , the probability to split the network into many parts becomes small .    a theoretical prediction for the size of the giant component exists only for the erds - rnyi random graph @xcite : when the average degree scales logarithmically with the number of vertices , i.e. , @xmath35 , the total number of vertices that do not belong to the giant component scales as @xmath36 for @xmath37 , while for @xmath38 the giant component engulfs the entire system .",
    "it turns out that for the same number of vertices and links , the completely random linking of the erds - rnyi graph keeps more vertices in a giant component than the corresponding duplication - symmetric divergence network . indeed , for the parameters corresponding to the fly dataset , @xmath39 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 , and @xmath40",
    ", the number of vertices not belonging to the giant component is @xmath41 ( see table  [ tab_comp ] ) .",
    "yet the erds - rnyi graph with the same number of vertices and links has only @xmath42 vertices outside of its giant component .",
    "this happens mainly because in our duplication - divergence growth model , once a component is split from the giant component , it never re - connects .",
    "if such separation happens at an early stage of the network growth , the separated component may grow to a significant size , thus leaving many vertices outside of the giant component . on contrary , at each step of the erds - rnyi growth , any two components can be united with a random link .",
    "this makes the co - existence of two or more large components very unprobable .",
    "in the previous sections the following conclusions on the clique abundances and growth laws of the duplication - divergence - heterodimerization networks have been made :    * we showed that the duplication - divergence network growth model , complimented with heterodimerization links between duplicates , correctly describes the statistics of cliques in biologically observed protein - protein networks .",
    "we derive an expression for clique population distribution that correctly describes the clique abundances in the duplication - divergence - heterodimerization networks .",
    "* generalizing the results obtained for the completely asymmetric divergence in @xcite , we demonstrated that similar regimes , such as presence and lack of self - averaging , growth and saturation of the average degree , scaling and fat tail in the degree distribution , exist in general duplication - divergence case as well .",
    "in addition , a clique density distribution is generalized onto the arbitrary divergence scenario .",
    "the heterodimerization links are not taken into account in our description of the network growth and degree distribution . despite their crucial role in the network topology and clique formation ,",
    "they constitute only about 1% of all links and do not contribute significantly to the degrees of the most of the vertices . for link inheritance and heterodimerization probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath3 , corresponding to the fly dataset , the resulting number of heterodimeric links in a network of the size of the fly dataset is @xmath43 .",
    "this is somewhat higher than the observed number of links between the pairs of recently duplicated ( paralogous ) proteins @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this discrepancy is that in our simulation all heterodimeric links are counted , while in the real protein network one can reliably identify only the pairs of recently duplicated proteins .    in a case of not completely asymmetric divergence when links can disappear both from the target and replica nodes , a network may fragment into several components . yet",
    "the biological protein networks are believed to be connected to ensure their functionality .",
    "hence during _ in vivo _ divergence the steps that lead to breaking the network into isolated components are excluded due to evolutionary pressure .",
    "our probabilistic network growth model does not take any evolutionary pressure into account .",
    "however , since for sufficiently high link retention probabilities the resulting network consists of one or very few large components , the number of link eliminations that have to be evolutionally overridden is small",
    ". hence most of the properties of the probabilistically grown graphs should be similar to those of the realistic evolutionary single - component networks .",
    "as the link inheritance probabilities @xmath45 decrease and the number of network components grow , the number of link removal steps that have to be evolutionally overridden becomes large .",
    "consequently , the probabilistic multi - component network becomes less similar to the real single - components one .    as we mentioned in the section ii , we selected the fly dataset as an example as being the most non - subjective one . other know",
    "protein - protein networks , such as for yeast , worm , and human , do contain parts of data that are results of the `` matrix '' recording of the experimental data from the immunoprecipitation experiments .",
    "these datasets contain a higher number of large cliques which can be attributed to this data interpretation . in principle",
    ", the clique population distribution derived here can be used to verify and filter the experimental datasets , removing the erroneously recordered large cliques .    in a recent publication , middendorf",
    "et al @xcite compared topological properties of the fly dataset to those of the networks grown by several mechanisms such as different versions of duplication - mutation model and preferential attachment .",
    "it was found that a duplication - mutation - complementation network provides the best fit to the fly dataset .",
    "the duplication - mutation - complementation network growth model is very close to the duplication - divergence - heterodimerization model studies here .",
    "complementation is equivalent to heterodimerization , the only difference between two models is in the way the links are deleted during divergence ( or mutation ) : unlike our model , in @xcite each neighbor remains connected to at least one of the two duplicates .",
    "thus we confirmed the conclusions made in @xcite that practically all considered properties of protein - protein networks are very well described by the duplication - divergence - heterodimerization model .    and finally a few words on the importance of heterodimerization links in clique formation .",
    "an alternative to heterodimerization way to connect paralogs is to link them randomly by  mutation  links . in this case",
    "the probability to establish a heterodimeric link @xmath3 has to be replaced by a probability that a mutation link , emanating from a target node , selects the replica node out of @xmath10 network nodes .",
    "this probability is equal to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of mutation links established at each duplication step . in the example of the fruit fly dataset where",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath25 , one needs @xmath48 random links at each step to form the correct number of triads and higher cliques .",
    "obviously , the mutation scenario which requires so many additional links is completely ruled out due to , for example , average degree constraint .",
