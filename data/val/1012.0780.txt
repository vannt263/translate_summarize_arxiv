    "noncommutative cosmology is a new and rapidly developing area of research , which aims at building cosmological models based on a  modified gravity \" action functional which arises naturally in the context of noncommutative geometry , the _ spectral action _ functional of @xcite . as we discuss more in detail in  [ nccosmsec ] below , this functional recovers the usual einstein ",
    "hilbert action , with additional terms , such as a conformal gravity , weyl curvature term .",
    "it also has the advantage of allowing for interesting couplings of gravity to matter , when extended from manifolds to  almost commutative geometries \" as in @xcite and later models @xcite , @xcite .",
    "thus , this approach makes it possible to recover from the same spectral action functional , in addition to the gravitational terms , the full lagrangian of various particle physics models , ranging from the minimal standard model of @xcite , to the extension with right handed neutrinos and majorana mass terms of @xcite , and to supersymmetric qcd as in @xcite .",
    "the study of cosmological models derived from the spectral action gave rise to early universe models as in @xcite and @xcite , which present various possible inflation scenarios , as well as effects on primordial black holes evaporation and gravitational wave propagation .",
    "effects on gravitational waves , as well as inflation scenarios coming from the spectral action functional , were also recently studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our previous work @xcite showed that , when one considers the nonperturbative form of the spectral action , as in @xcite , one obtains a slow - roll potential for inflation .",
    "we compared some of the more likely candidates for cosmic topologies ( the quaternionic and dodecahedral cosmology , and the flat tori ) and we showed that , in the spherical cases ( quaternionic and dodecahedral ) , the nonperturbative spectral action is just a multiple of the spectral action of the sphere @xmath1 , and consequently the inflation potential only differs from the one of the sphere case by a constant scaling factor , which cancels out in the computation of the slow - roll parameters , which are therefore the same as in the case of a simply connected topology and do not distinguish the different cosmic topologies with the same spherical geometry .",
    "this result for spherical space forms was further confirmed and extended in @xcite , where the nonperturbative spectral action is computed explicitly for _ all _ the spherical space forms and it is shown to be always a multiple of the spectral action of @xmath1 , with a proportionality factor that depends explicitly on the 3-manifold .",
    "thus , different candidate cosmic topologies with the same positively curved geometry yield the same values of the slow - roll parameters and of the power - law indices and tensor - to - scalar ratio , which are computed from these parameters .    in @xcite , however , we showed that the inflation potential obtained from the nonperturbative spectral action is different in the case of the flat tori , and not just by a scalar dilation factor .",
    "thus , we know already that the possible inflation scenarios in noncommutative cosmology depend on the underlying geometry ( flat or positively curved ) of the universe , and the slow  roll parameters are different for these two classes .",
    "the slow - roll parameters alone only distinguish , in our model , between the flat and spherical geometries but not between different topologies within each class .",
    "however , in the present paper we show that , when one looks at the amplitudes for the power spectra for density perturbations and gravitational waves ( scalar and tensor perturbations ) , these detect the different scaling factors in the slow - roll potentials we obtain for the different spherical and flat topologies , hence we obtain genuinely different inflation scenarios for different cosmic topologies .",
    "we achieve this result by relying on the computations of the nonperturbative spectral action , which in the spherical cases are obtained in @xcite and @xcite , and by deriving in this paper the analogous explicit computation of the nonperturbative spectral action for the flat bieberbach manifolds .",
    "a similar computation of the spectral action for bieberbach manifolds was simultaneously independently obtained by piotr olczykowski and andrzej sitarz in @xcite .",
    "thus , the main conclusion of this paper is that _ a modified gravity model based on the spectral action functional predicts a coupling between cosmic topology and inflation potential , with different scalings in the power spectra that distinguish between different topologies , and slow - roll parameters that distinguish between the spherical and flat cases . _",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe in  [ inflgeomsec ] the broader context in which the problem we consider here falls , namely the cosmological results relating inflation , the geometry of the universe , and the background radiation , and the problem of cosmic topology .",
    "we then review briefly in  [ nccosmsec ] the use of the spectral action as a modified gravity functional and the important distinction between its asymptotic expansion at large energies and the nonperturbative form given in terms of dirac spectra . in  [ biebsec ]",
    "we present the main mathematical result of this paper , which gives an explicit calculation of the nonperturbative spectral action for certain bieberbach manifolds , using the dirac spectra of @xcite and a poisson summation technique similar to that introduced in @xcite , and used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , in  [ inflpotsec ] we compare the resulting slow - roll inflation potentials , power spectra for density perturbations and slow - roll parameters , for all the different possible cosmic topologies .",
    "it is well known that the mechanism of cosmic inflation , first proposed by alan guth and andrei linde , naturally leads to a flat or almost flat geometry of the universe ( see for instance  1.7 of @xcite ) .",
    "it was then shown in @xcite that the geometry of the universe can be read in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , by showing that the anisotropies of the cmb depend primarily upon the geometry of the universe ( flat , positively or negatively curved ) and that this information can be detected through the fact that the location of the first doppler peak changes for different values of the curvature and is largely unaffected by other parameters .",
    "this theoretical result made it possible to devise an observational test that could confirm the inflationary theory and its prediction for a flat or nearly flat geometry .",
    "the experimental confirmation of the nearly flat geometry of the universe came in @xcite through the boomerang experiment .",
    "thus , the geometry of the universe leaves a measurable trace in the cmb , and measurements confirmed the flat geometry predicted by inflationary models .",
    "the cosmic topology problem instead concentrates not on the question about the curvature and the geometry of the universe , but on the possible existence , for a given geometry , of a non - simply connected topology , that is , of whether the spatial sections of spacetime can be compact 3-manifolds which are either quotients of the 3-sphere ( spherical space forms ) in the positively curved case , quotients of 3-dimensional euclidean space ( flat tori or bieberbach manifolds ) in the flat case , or quotients of the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space ( hyperbolic 3-manifolds ) in the negatively curved space . a general introduction to the problem of cosmic topology",
    "is given in @xcite .    since the cosmological observations prefer a flat or nearly flat positively curved geometry to a nearly flat negatively curved geometry ( see @xcite , @xcite ) , most of the work in trying to identify the most likely candidates for a non - trivial cosmic topology concentrate on the flat spaces and the spherical space forms .",
    "various methods have been devised to try to detect signatures of cosmic topology in the cmb , in particular through a detailed analysis of simulated cmb skies for various candidate cosmic topologies ( see @xcite for the flat cases ) .",
    "it is believed that perhaps some puzzling features of the cmb such as the very low quadrupole , the very planar octupole , and the quadrupole",
    " octupole alignment may find an explanation in the possible presence of a non - simply connected topology , but no conclusive results to that effect have yet been obtained .",
    "the recent results of @xcite show that a modified gravity model based on the spectral action functional imposes constraints on the form of the possible inflation slow - roll potentials , which depend on the geometry and topology of the universe , as shown in @xcite .",
    "while the resulting slow - roll parameters and spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio distinguish the even very slightly positively curved case from the flat case , these parameters alone do not distinguish between the different spherical topologies , as shown in @xcite . as we show in this paper",
    ", the situation is similar for the flat manifolds : these same parameters alone do not distinguish between the various bieberbach manifolds ( quotients of the flat torus ) , but they do distinguish these from the spherical quotients .",
    "however , if one considers , in addition to the slow - roll parameters , also the power spectra for the density fluctuations , one can see that , in our model based on the spectral action as a modified gravity functional , the resulting slow - roll potentials give different power spectra that distinguish between all the different topologies .",
    "we first need to recall here some well known facts about slow - roll inflation potentials , slow - roll parameters , and the power spectra for density perturbations and gravitational waves .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and to @xcite , @xcite , as well as to the survey of inflationary cosmology @xcite .",
    "consider an expanding universe , which is topologically a cylinder @xmath2 , for a @xmath0-manifold @xmath3 , with a lorentzian metric of the usual friedmann form @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the riemannian metric on the @xmath0-manifold @xmath3 .    in models of inflation based on a single scalar field slow - roll potential @xmath6 ,",
    "the dynamics of the scale factor @xmath7 in the friedmann metric is related to the scalar field dynamics through the acceleration equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the hubble parameter , which is related to the scalar field and the inflation potential by @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the slow - roll parameter , which depends on the potential @xmath12 as described in below , see @xcite for more details .",
    "it is customary to decompose perturbations of the metric @xmath13 of into scalar and tensor perturbations , which correspond , respectively , to density fluctuations and gravitational waves .",
    "one typically neglects the remaining vector components of the perturbation , assuming that these are not generated by inflation and decay with the expansion of the universe , see  9.2 of @xcite .",
    "thus , one writes scalar and tensor perturbations in the form @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and where the @xmath17 give the tensor part of the perturbation , satisfying @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the tensor perturbations @xmath17 have two polarization modes , which correspond to the two polarizations of the gravitational waves .",
    "one considers then the intrinsic curvature perturbation @xmath20 which measures the spatial curvature of a comoving hypersurface , that is , a hypersurface with constant @xmath21 . after expanding @xmath22 in fourier modes in the form",
    "@xmath23 one obtains the power spectrum @xmath24 for the density fluctuations ( scalar perturbations of the metric ) from the two - point correlation function , @xmath25 in the case of a gaussian distribution , the power spectrum describes the complete statistical information on the perturbations , while the higher order correlations functions contain the information on the possible presence of non - gaussianity phenomena .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath26 for the tensor perturbations is similarly obtained by expanding the tensor fluctiations in fourier modes @xmath27 and computing the two - point correlation function @xmath28 see @xcite ,  9.3 , and @xcite for more details .    in slow - roll inflation models , the power spectra @xmath24 and @xmath26 are related to the slow - roll potential @xmath6 through the leading order expression ( see @xcite ) @xmath29 up to a constant proportionality factor , and with @xmath30 the planck mass . here the potential @xmath6 and its derivative @xmath31 are to be evaluated at @xmath32 where the corresponding scale leaves the horizon during inflation .",
    "these can be expressed a power law as ( @xcite ) @xmath33   \\cp_t(k ) \\sim & \\cp_t(k_0 ) \\displaystyle{\\left(\\frac{k}{k_0 }   \\right)^{n_t + \\frac{\\alpha_t}{2 } \\log(k / k_0 ) } } , \\end{array}\\ ] ] where the spectral parameters @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 depend on the slow  roll potential in the following way . in the slow - roll approximation ,",
    "the slow - roll parameters are given by the expressions @xmath38",
    "\\eta = & \\displaystyle{\\frac{m_{pl}^2}{8\\pi } \\frac{v^{\\prime\\prime}}{v } } \\\\[3 mm ] \\xi = & \\displaystyle{\\frac{m_{pl}^4}{64\\pi^2 } \\frac{v^\\prime v^{\\prime\\prime\\prime}}{v^2 } }   \\end{array}\\ ] ] notice that we follow here a different convention with respect to the one we used in @xcite on the form of the slow - roll parameters .",
    "the spectral parameters are then obtained from these as @xmath39 n_t \\simeq & - 2 \\epsilon \\\\[2 mm ] \\alpha_s \\simeq & 16 \\epsilon \\eta - 24 \\epsilon^2 - 2 \\xi \\\\[2 mm ] \\alpha_t \\simeq & 4 \\epsilon\\eta - 8 \\epsilon^2 \\end{array}\\ ] ] while the tensor - to - scalar ratio is given by @xmath40    from the point of view of our model , the following observation will be useful when we compare the slow - roll potentials that we obtain for different cosmic topologies and how they affect the power spectra .",
    "[ scalevandp ] given a slow - roll potential @xmath6 and the corresponding power spectra @xmath24 and @xmath26 as in and .",
    "if the potential @xmath6 is rescaled by a constant factor @xmath41 , then the power spectra @xmath24 and @xmath26 are also rescaled by the same factor @xmath42 , while in the power law the exponents are unchanged .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of , , , and .",
    "in fact , from , we see that @xmath41 maps @xmath43 , and also @xmath44 , since it transforms @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "the expressions @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 in the slow - roll parameters are left unchanged by @xmath49 , so that the slow - roll parameters and all the resulting spectral parameters of are unchanged .",
    "thus , the power law only changes by a multiplicative factor @xmath50 and @xmath51 , with unchanged exponents .",
    "in its nonperturbative form , the spectral action is defined in terms of the spectrum of the dirac operator , on a spin manifold or more generally on a noncommutative space ( a spectral triple ) , as the functional @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is a smooth test function and @xmath54 is an energy scale that makes @xmath55 dimensionless .",
    "the reason why this can be regarded as an action functional for gravity ( or gravity coupled to matter in the noncommutative case ) lies in the fact that , for large energies @xmath54 it has an asymptotic expansion ( see @xcite ) of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57 and with the integrations @xmath58 given by residues of zeta function @xmath59 at the positive points of the _ dimension spectrum _ of the spectral triple , that is , the set of poles of the zeta functions . in the case of a 4-dimensional spin manifold , these ,",
    "in turn , are expressed in terms of integrals of curvature terms .",
    "these include the usual einstein ",
    "hilbert action @xmath60 and a cosmological term @xmath61 but it also contains some additional terms , like a non - dynamical topological term @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the form that represents the pontrjagin class and integrates to a multiple of the euler characteristic of the manifold , as well as a conformal gravity term @xmath64 which is given in terms of the weyl curvature tensor .",
    "we do not give any more details here and we refer the reader to chapter 1 of @xcite for a more complete treatment .    the presence of conformal gravity terms along with the einstein  hilbert and cosmological terms give then a modified gravity action functional .",
    "when one considers the nonperturbative form of the spectral action , rather than its asymptotic expansion at large energies , one can find additional nonperturbative correction terms .",
    "one of these was identified in @xcite , in the case of the 3-sphere , as a potential for a scalar field , which was interpreted in @xcite as a potential for a cosmological slow - roll inflation scenario , and computed for other , non - simply connected cosmic topologies .",
    "the nonperturbative spectral action for the spherical space forms @xmath65 was computed recently by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , although the dirac spectra can be significantly different for different spin structures , the spectral action itself is independent of the choice of the spin structure , and it is always equal to a constant multiple of the spectral action for the 3-sphere @xmath1 , where the multiple is just dividing by the order of the group @xmath66 .",
    "this is exactly what one expects by looking at the asymptotic expansion of the spectral action for large energies @xmath54 , and the only significant nonperturbative effect arises in the form of a slow - roll potential , as in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "[ sphereformsspac ] _",
    "( teh , @xcite ) _ for all the spherical space forms @xmath67 with the round metric induced from @xmath1 , and for all choices of spin structure , the nonperturbative spectral action on @xmath3 is equal to @xmath68 up to order @xmath69 .",
    "correspondingly , as explained in  5 of @xcite , one obtains a slow - roll potential by considering the variation @xmath70 of the spectral action as in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , one considers a euclidean compactification of the 4-dimensional spacetime @xmath71 to a compact riemannian manifold @xmath72 with the compactification @xmath73 of size @xmath74 .",
    "one then computes the spectral action @xmath75 on this compactification and its variation @xmath76 up to terms of order @xmath69 , where the potential @xmath6 is given by the following .",
    "[ s3potential ] let @xmath3 be a spherical space form @xmath65 with the induced round metric .",
    "let @xmath77 be the radius of the sphere @xmath1 and @xmath74 the size of the circle @xmath73 in the euclidean compactification @xmath78 . then the slow - roll potential @xmath6 in is of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 with @xmath81 and with @xmath82    the statement follows directly from the result of theorem 7 of @xcite and  5 of @xcite .    in particular , for the different spherical forms , the potential has the same form as that of the 3-sphere case , but it is scaled by the factor @xmath83 , @xmath84    notice , moreover , that in the potential @xmath85 one has an overall factor of @xmath86 that multiplies the @xmath87 term and a factor of @xmath88 that multiplies the @xmath89 term . as we observed already in @xcite ,",
    "when one wick rotates back to the minkowskian model with the friedmann metric , both the scale factor @xmath7 and the energy scale @xmath90 evolve with the expansion of the universe , but in such a way that @xmath91 so that the product @xmath92 . in @xcite we did not need to analyze the behavior of the @xmath93 factor , since we only looked at the slow - roll parameters where that factor cancels out . in the spectral action model of cosmology ,",
    "the choice of the scale @xmath74 of the euclidean compactification is an artifact of the model , which allows one to compute the spectral action in terms of the spectrum of the dirac operator on the compact riemannian 4-manifold @xmath72 . eventually , the physically significant quantities derived from the spectral action functional are wick rotated back to the minkowskian signature case . since in its nonperturbative form",
    "the spectral action functional is supposed to give a modified gravity action functional that works at all scales , not just in the asymptotic expansion for large @xmath54 , it seems therefore natural to set the choice of the length @xmath74 in the model so that the product @xmath94 remains constant .",
    "another reason for making the assumption that @xmath94 is the interpretation given in @xcite of the parameter @xmath74 in the euclidean compactification as an inverse temperature .",
    "then , up to a universal constant , that behaves like the inverse of an energy scale and , when rotating back to the minkowskian signature , one knows that , in the expansion of the universe the scale factor @xmath7 is inversely proportional to the temperature , so that the assumption @xmath94 is justified .    with this setting ,",
    "the slow - roll potential one obtains in the case of the 3-sphere is of the form @xmath95    then one has the following result for the power spectra for the various cosmic topology candidates given by spherical space forms .",
    "[ powerspheres ] let @xmath96 and @xmath97 denote the power spectra for the density fluctuations and the gravitational waves , computed as in , for the slow - roll potential @xmath98 .",

    "we now consider the case of candidate cosmic topologies that are flat 3-manifolds .",
    "the simplest case is the flat torus @xmath116 , which we have already discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are then the bieberbach manifolds , which are obtained as quotients of the torus by a finite group action . in this section",
    "we give an explicit computation of the nonperturbative spectral action for the bieberbach manifolds ( with the exception of @xmath117 which requires a different technique and will be analyzed elsewhere ) , and in the next section we then derive the analog of proposition [ powerspheres ] for the case of these flat geometries .",
    "the dirac spectrum of bieberbach manifolds is computed in @xcite for each of the six affine equivalence classes of three - dimensional orientable bieberbach manifolds , and for each possible choice of spin structure and choice of flat metric .",
    "these classes are labeled @xmath118 through @xmath119 , with @xmath118 simply being the flat 3-torus .    in general , the dirac spectrum for each space depends on the choice of spin structure . however , as in the case of the spherical manifolds , we show here that the nonperturbative spectral action is _ independent of the spin structure_.    we follow the notation of @xcite , according to which the different possibilities for the dirac spectra are indicated by a letter ( e.g. @xmath120 ) .",
    "note that it is possible for several spin structures to yield the same dirac spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the bieberbach manifolds generally consists of a symmetric component and an asymmetric component as computed in @xcite .",
    "the symmetric components are parametrized by subsets @xmath122 , such that the eigenvalues are given by some formula @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and the multiplicity of each eigenvalue , @xmath125 , is some constant times the number of @xmath124 such that @xmath126 . in the case of @xmath121 , @xmath127 , @xmath117 , @xmath119",
    "the constant is @xmath128 , while in the @xmath129 case the constant is @xmath130 .",
    "the approach we use here to compute the spectral action nonperturbatively consists of using the symmetries of @xmath131 as a function of @xmath124 to almost cover all of the points in @xmath132 and then apply the poisson summation formula as used in @xcite . by `` almost cover '' ,",
    "it is meant that it is perfectly acceptable if two- , one- , or zero - dimensional lattices through the origin are covered multiple times , or not at all .    the asymmetric component of the spectrum appears only some of the time .",
    "the appearance of the asymmetric component depends on the choice of spin structure . for those cases where it appears , the eigenvalues in the asymmetric component consist of the set @xmath133 where @xmath134 is a constant depending on the spin structure , and",
    "@xmath135 is given in the following table :       notice that some ambiguities remain : the form of the potential and the value of the scale factor @xmath125 alone do not distinguish , for instance , between a lens space with @xmath136 , a binary dihedral quotient with @xmath137 and the binary tetrahedral quotient , or between the poincar dodecahedral space ( the binary icosahedral quotient ) , a lens space of order @xmath138 and a binary dihedral quotient with @xmath139 .",
    "at this point we do not know whether more refined information can be extracted from the spectral action that can further distinguish between these cases , but we expect that , when taking into account a more sophisticated version of the spectral action model , where gravity is coupled to matter by the presence of additional ( non - commutative ) small extra - dimensions ( as in @xcite , @xcite ) , one may be able to distinguish further . in fact , instead of a trivial product @xmath140 , one can include the non - commutative space @xmath141 using a topologically non - trivial fibration over the 4-dimensional spacetime @xmath142 and this allows for a more refines range of proportionality factors @xmath108 .",
