    "classically , invertible piecewise isometries have been studied in one dimension ; these are the so - called interval exchange mappings ( iets for short ) , which can appear for example as first return maps of geodesic and billiard flows . a natural generalization of iets to the noninvertible case , interval translation mappings ( itms for short ) , has been recently introduced by boshernitzan and kornfeld @xcite .",
    "itms have been studied for their topological dynamics in @xcite , and for their invariant measures and complexity in @xcite .",
    "many 0-entropy maps of the interval are ( semi)conjugate to itms @xcite . in @xcite",
    "several very interesting questions were asked , which we answer in this article for a special class of interval translation mappings .",

    "we define an inducing procedure similar to rauzy induction for interval exchange mappings @xcite .",
    "it defines a map @xmath0 in parameter space which plays the same role as the well - known gauss map for circle rotations ; we call @xmath0 the _ gauss map _ for our class of itms .",
    "whether the induction procedure can be extended to all itms is a very interesting open problem .    using the gauss map , we prove that almost every map in our class is of finite type ( i.e. , its attractor is a union interval rather than a cantor set ) , giving a partial answer to a question posed in @xcite .",
    "if the itm has a cantor attractor , we specify an isomorphism to a shift space generated by a chain of substitutions .",
    "we give an upper bound on the dimension of the attractor .",
    "although the attractor is `` dynamically defined '' , it is interesting to note that its upper box dimension need not be equal to its hausdorff dimension .",
    "hausdorff measure , whether finite or not , is always @xmath1-invariant .",
