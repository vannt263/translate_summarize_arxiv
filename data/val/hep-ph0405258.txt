    "through the formalism of effective field theory a significant progress has been reached in our attempt to undertstand the physics involving mesons and baryons in nuclear matter .",
    "the first effective descriptions appeared as generalizations of the linear @xmath0 model so that the physical constraint dictated by the broken - realized chiral symmetry of qcd was naturally included .",
    "more recently , the interest was focused on models incorporating the broken scale invariance of strong interactions and therefore suitable for describing physics beyond the pion sector @xcite . among these models ,",
    "an interesting approach consists in introducing a scalar glueball with an appropriate potential into a nonlinear realization of the @xmath0 model , thus accounting for both broken - scale and chiral symmetries @xcite . from this background , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite proposed a skyrmion - type lagrangian with spontaneously broken chiral and scale symmetries .",
    "this model , which is valid as an approximation to qcd in the large @xmath1-limit , is useful for studying the properties of pions in dense medium and can also describe multibaryon systems , including dense hadronic matter . in this scenario , baryons arise as solitonic solutions of the equations of motion that , because of their nonlinearity , can not be solved in an analytical closed form .    naturally , it is desirable that the advance in the theoretical domain be accompanied by the solution of the mathematical problems introduced .",
    "our contribution in this paper is to give analytical approximate representations for the single soliton that is used to define the parameters of the theory at zero density .",
    "this types of representation are preferred to numerical solutions because with them one can trace exact analytical information about the soliton solution .",
    "besides , explicit representations are very convenient for phenomenological calculations in the analysis of dense skyrmion matter .",
    "our procedure will consists of extracting the structure of the exact solution from an asymptotic analysis of the equations of motion for the scalar and chiral fields , and then we look for solutions in terms of rational approximants , pad approximants , that have proved to be particularly successful in giving a faithful representation of the topological configuration of the original skyrme model @xcite . here , the task is more involved since it requires the resolution of two coupled nonlinear differential equations for the new scalar field and the chiral field already present in the skyrme model .",
    "furthermore , the nonzero mass for pions and the additional scalar field imply exponential asymptotic behaviors for both solutions , and this feature must be incorporated in the approximants .",
    "we will see that the analytical approach to the single skyrmion with the scalar field problem can be implemented in a simple way and that the suggested representations reproduce the properties of the exact solutions for small and large values of the radius @xmath2 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly describe the model that is composed by the original skyrme model implemented with the trace anomaly of qcd , signal of the broken - realized scale invariance .",
    "in sec.iii we present the properties of the single skyrmion and the scalar field and then , in sec.iv we construct the rational representations by using the exact asymptotic solutions for both the chiral and the scalar field and we present an analysis of convergence of the proposed approximants . finally , we give the conclusions of our work in sec.v .",
    "the model constitutes an extension to the original skyrme model that emerged as an attempt to describe baryons interacting by means of meson exchanges @xcite . in a more recent formulation introduced by ellis and lanik @xcite and developed in further works for the description of nuclear matter and finite nuclei @xcite ,",
    "the task was aimed at incorporating the underlying scale invariance of qcd under the scale transformation @xmath3    this symmetry is broken at the quantum level by dimensional transmutation , and its breaking is manifested through a nonvanishing trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath4 , referred to as the qcd trace anomaly which in the chiral limit is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the one - loop beta function of @xmath7 .",
    "the description starts with the skyrme lagrangian for massive pion fields , which reads @xmath8 ^ 2+\\frac{f_{\\pi}^2m_{\\pi}^2}{4}\\mathrm{tr}(u+u^{\\dagger}-2),\\ ] ] where the goldstone pion fields @xmath9 play the role of a chiral phase angle present in the chiral field @xmath10 belonging to @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the pion decay constant , the pion mass and the skyrme parameter , respectively .",
    "the broken - scale invariance of qcd is implemented by the introduction of a scalar field @xmath15 with a scale dimension 1 .",
    "this scalar degree of freedom is interpreted as a bound state of gluons , the glueball field , that operates on two - pion exchange physics in meson - exchange phenomenology .    with an appropriate scaling breaking - potential for the scalar field @xmath15 , the modified lagrangian that respects the scaling properties of qcd reads @xmath16)^2+\\frac{f_{\\pi}^2m_{\\pi}^2}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\chi}{f_{\\chi}}\\right)^3\\mathrm{tr}(u+u^{\\dagger}-2 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\chi\\partial^{\\mu}\\chi-\\frac{1}{4}\\frac{m^2_{\\chi}}{f^2_{\\chi}}\\left[\\chi^4\\left(\\ln(\\chi / f_{\\chi})-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)+\\frac{1}{4}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",
    ", @xmath17 is the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field @xmath15 .",
    "the mass of @xmath15 is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 denotes the scale - breaking potential .",
    "no experimental values are available for those parameters , and conjectural values depend rather on specific considerations of the model , as it is explained in ref .",
    "the inability to fix them comes from the lack of knowledge about the mixing between the two components of the trace anomaly corresponding , respectively , to the chiral ( `` soft '' ) and scale ( `` hard '' ) symmetry - breaking contributions .",
    "mixing depends on the baryonic sector to be described .",
    "for instance , in matter it is assumed that the glueball contribution decouples gradually with increasing density , reaching a critical point at which only the `` soft '' component is relevant . in such a case ,",
    "the parameters can be fixed constraining the model by the bulk properties of finite nuclei and yielding the values @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 mev . in section iv , we present the approximants to the solitonic solutions corresponding to the different sets of parameters reported elsewhere . concerning the pion parameters , the accepted experimental values are @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev .",

    "previous works @xcite that addressed solving the equation of motion of the original skyrme model have shown the utility , for practical calculations , of implementing an approach that incorporates both asymptotic behaviors of the chiral angle @xmath27 , near the origin and at large @xmath2 , in one single representation .",
    "the rational approximants have proved to be suitable for this purpose .",
    "moreover , it has been shown in ref.@xcite that starting from the well - known pad approximant approach , a simple and systematic method to solve the skyrme problem can be developed . in the following discussion",
    "we extend the analytical approach for the single skyrmion with the scalar field , showing that the exponential behavior ( [ asymptotic ] ) can be easily incorporated into rational representations , providing satisfactory analytical continuations of the power - series representations ( [ powerseries ] ) .",
    "we will begin by computing a sequence of pad approximants using suitable anstze for the functions @xmath27 and @xmath28 suggested from the previous study of the stucture of the exact solution .",
    "we continue the discussion by showing that the convergence to the exact solution is drastically improved when using a variational method to minimize @xmath26 $ ] , supplemented by our anstze for the fields .",

    "note that the functional form that is proposed has the exact asymptotic behavior at infinity , that is , @xmath68 .",

    "it is possible to construct another approximant of the same order [ 0,1 ] , but with an additional parameter @xmath72 , @xmath73 @xmath72 should be chosen so as to reproduce the exact asymptotic decay for large @xmath2 .",
    "the higher - order approximants contain the information of additional terms of the exact expansion at the origin .",
    "obviously , they improve the degree of approximation to the exact solution .",
    "for instance , keeping the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) and fixing the coefficients by means of the pad approximant method using equations ( [ powerseries]-[coefficients ] ) , we find for the @xmath74 $ ] approximant the following expression @xmath75 } f[1,2]=\\frac{\\pi(1+a_1y)}{1+b_1y+b_2y^2\\exp(m_{\\pi}y / f_{\\pi}e)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath76 and for the @xmath77 $ ] order approximant @xmath78 } f[2,3]=\\frac{\\pi(1+a_1y+a_2y^2)}{1+b_1y+b_2y^2+b_3y^3\\exp(m_{\\pi}y / ef_{\\pi})}\\ ] ] with @xmath79/\\delta , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 $ ] . + by construction , from the taylor expansion of the pad approximants ( [ ap[1,2 ] ] ) and ( [ ap[2,3 ] ] ) we recover the exact behavior near the origin [ relations ( [ powerseries ] ) ] up to orders @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "note also that , as the proposed approximants satisfy the right boundary conditions , they yield to topological solutions of baryonic number equal to @xmath85 . that is , recalling eq.([bcurrent ] ) , @xmath86_0^{\\infty}=1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the sequence of pad approximants to the chiral angle @xmath44 given by equations ( [ f[0,1]]-[ap[2,3 ] ] ) is shown in fig.1 together with the exact numerical solution .",
    "the approximate representations show convergence to the exact numerical solutions ; unfortunately , we found that higher - order calculations in the pad procedure lead to singular approximants being no longer relevant to represent @xmath27 .    in order to eliminate spurious representations with singularities in the real @xmath29 axis one",
    "may proceed heuristically by adding restrictions to the numerator coefficients of the approximants .",
    "for instance , by simply setting @xmath87 for all @xmath88 we will produce well - behaved and positive - definite approximants , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "this procedure , which relies on simplicity , can be particularly useful in problems for which one seeks for an analytical description of skyrmion - skyrmion interactions such as in dibaryon models or other multi - skyrmion models @xcite .",
    "however the prescription of setting @xmath87 is too arbitrary and does not really select the solutions that minimize the energy functional @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "one can actually confirm this fact by studying the sequence of restricted rational approximants @xmath89 $ ] for the chiral angle .",
    "the sequence of restricted pad approximants is displayed in fig.2 where we can see a fast convergence to the @xmath90 $ ] order representation .",
    "as we should expect , the convergence to the numerical solution is very fast at the boundaries , however the representations underestimate in @xmath91 to @xmath92 in the @xmath93 region .",
    "higher order approximations slightly improve the agreement with the numerical solution but at the price of getting less attractive expression for using in phenomenological calculations from the model .",
    "quality tests of the approximation are done further in this work by calculating physical quantities that frequently enter in the evaluation of the static properties of the nucleons .",
    "the low convergence to the numerical solution is a consequence of the fixing condition @xmath87 which appears to be too restrictive .",
    "we will see further in this section that the convergence to the exact numerical results is drastically improved and the arbitrariness in the approximate representations eliminated by taking the expansion coefficients in the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) as free parameters and then minimizing by numerical methods the functional of energy @xmath26 $ ] given in eq.([mass ] ) .    to this end",
    "we first need to give a suitable ansatz for the scalar field @xmath94 .",
    "one can notice that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath95 has the same functional form as the one corresponding to the profile function of the skyrmion so that analogous representations to those of @xmath44 should provide good results for the scalar field .",
    "thus , we propose , @xmath96    of course , we should expect a change on the dependence of the rational representations parameters on the power series coefficients as , in this case , the perturbative solution is given in even powers of @xmath29 ( see eq.([powerseries ] ) ) .",
    "our best representations of the exact solutions for @xmath44 and @xmath94 are obtained by keeping the functional forms ( [ ansatz ] ) , ( [ ansatzc ] ) and relaxing the conditions for the expansion coefficients .",
    "these are to be found by minimizing the functional of energy following a variational method .",
    "we give the first two approximants in the sequence @xmath89 $ ] which are yet very good representations for the fields as it can be seen in fig.3 .",

    "the analysis for other values of @xmath101 and @xmath17 , as those reported elsewhere @xcite , give analogous results .",

    "we would like to stress that the phenomenological calculations , which involve a highly nontrivial nonlinear problem , get considerably simplified through the use of the proposed analytical approximate representations .",
    "certainly , the most interesting feature of our representations is that they contain , in an explicit form , exact analytical properties of skyrmion solution for the skyrme model with the scalar field problem as eqs.([powerseries ] ) and ( [ asymptotic ] ) can be fully recovered from them .",
