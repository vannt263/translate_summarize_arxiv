    "in the last ten years the existence of supermassive black holes in the central part of an increasing number of galaxies has become a stronger and stronger evidence . in order to understand the formation process and the evolution of those black holes , it is important to relate them to the properties of the host galaxy .",
    "it was shown that the existence of a central smbh affects the dynamics not only in the core of the host galaxy but even in a region far from the hole .",
    "several relationships have been recently proposed between the mass of a central smbh and the velocity dispersion @xcite , the bulge luminosity or mass @xcite or the dark matter halo @xcite , of the corresponding galaxy . among them , the relationship with the smallest scatter is @xmath4 where @xmath5 .",
    "the different values of @xmath6 , found by several authors using different samples and different fitting methods , are well discussed in the paper of tremaine et al .",
    "@xcite that obtain @xmath7 where ( and also afterwards in the rest of our paper ) @xmath8 is expressed in solar masses , @xmath9 in @xmath10 and logarithms are base 10 .",
    "from the theoretical point of view there are still different interpretations of these results @xcite and in order to give a contribution to this open debate , in a previous paper @xcite , we proposed to study a relationship between the kinetic energy of random motions of elliptical galaxies and the rest energy of their central supermassive black hole .",
    "we used a sample formed by the intersection between the set of galaxies studied by tremaine et al . @xcite and the kinematical data extracted by @xcite that refer to the effective semimajor axis of each galaxy @xmath11 ( related to the effective radius @xmath12 by the formula @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ellipticity ) .",
    "the model used to compute the kinematical parameters is very simple .",
    "busarello , longo and feoli @xcite assumed that an elliptical galaxy    1 .   has a spheroidal symmetry , 2 .",
    "follows the de vaucouleurs @xmath15 law , 3 .",
    "its rotation axis is perpendicular to the line of sight , 4 .",
    "its stars have a rotation velocity with cylindrical symmetry and 5 .",
    "its velocity dispersion tensor is isotropic and has spherical symmetry .",
    "the details of the procedure used to compute velocity dispersions , rotation velocities and the masses of the 13 elliptical galaxies included in the so called sample a ( see table 1 ) were fully explained in @xcite and summarized in our previous paper @xcite ( hereafter afdm ) .",
    "our first results were very encouraging because we found , taking into account errors in both variables and using an iterative procedure due to orear @xcite : @xmath16 with ( see appendix for definitions ) @xmath17 and with a linear correlation coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "if the akritas and bershadi method @xcite is used , the slope of the relationship is even closer to unity : @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "even better results can be obtained using a reduced sample ( hereafter sample b ) of galaxies if we eliminate the two ellipticals with the largest residuals n821 and n4697 .",
    "the relationships obtained applying the fitting procedure to the remaining 11 galaxies are listed in afdm .",
    "the satisfying results are the increase of the correlation coefficient , the decrease of @xmath21 , and a slope closer to unity .    in order to understand better the origin of this relationship",
    ", we have performed in this paper four new tests :    1 .",
    "we used the well known iterative procedure of fitexy routine ( we had never used before ) to analyze again the same samples a and b of the previous paper afdm in the case of errors in both variables ; 2 .",
    "the simplest hypothesis of a linear relationship was tested using the exact `` least - squares '' fitting method ; 3 .",
    "the kinematical data used in the previous paper were extracted by old sources so we have performed a check of the relationship using the data recently published by hring and rix @xcite .",
    "4 .   in afdm",
    "we have considered only elliptical galaxies . in this paper",
    "we tested the robustness of the relationship , including in the statistical analysis also the lenticular and spiral galaxies of the sample published by hring and rix @xcite .",
    "there is another remarkable novelty contained in this paper .",
    "actually in afdm we found a very poor correlation between the mass of the galaxy and its velocity dispersion . on the contrary with the sample of hring and rix @xcite",
    "this relationship is stronger and we will show that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 then ( as we expected ) a relation @xmath24 is such that @xmath25 furthermore , using the new data , we will show that the equation ( 7 ) has a @xmath21 smaller than the relation ( 6 ) .",
    ".we list in column ( 1 ) the name of the galaxy , in column ( 2 ) the black hole masses taken from tremaine et al .",
    "the velocity dispersions ( column 3 ) and the rotation velocities ( column 4 ) are taken from busarello , feoli and longo @xcite , the masses in column ( 5 ) from curir et al.@xcite and the corresponding relative errors in column ( 6 ) from busarello and longo @xcite .",
    "the sources of the experimental data for each galaxy are listed in the above mentioned papers . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results are listed in table 5 and we argue that for the sample b the hypothesis is certainly right , and for the samples a and @xmath26 it can be acceptable . only the samples @xmath27 and c have a too high @xmath21 .",
    "the linear fit of sample c is shown in fig .",
    "1 with a dashed line and involves @xmath28 .",
    "the fourth test for our relationship is the inclusion of lenticular and spiral galaxies in the statistical analysis .",
    "our sample d is now composed by all the 29 galaxies listed in table 2 . in fig .",
    "3 we show with a dashed line the best fit ( 11 ) for the 18 ellipticals ( denoted with boxes ) , with the dot - dashed line the best fit for the remaining 11 galaxies ( denoted with circles ) : @xmath29 and with a solid line the best fit for the whole sample d @xmath30 we argue that the contribution of lenticular and spiral galaxies increases the slope that becomes closer to unity .",
    "from the first samples of data ( a and b ) we were induced in a previous paper @xcite to consider a relationship between the masses of smbhs and the kinetic energy of random motions in elliptical galaxies . this suggestion",
    "is now confirmed first by reanalyzing the old data using the fitexy routine and then comparing the results with the corresponding fit of a new set of kinematical data extracted from the paper of hring and rix @xcite . in the light of fig .",
    "3 we show that the relationship works well also for lenticular and spiral galaxies .",
    "the remarkable result is that the relationship we proposed ( 7 ) , has now a smaller scatter with respect to the old equation ( 6 ) and the @xmath8 vs @xmath31 law .",
    "furthermore we have shown that , using the new data , all these relationships can be strictly connected because ( unlike afdm ) the mass of the galaxy strongly depends on the velocity dispersion : the linear correlation coefficient of this relationship ( 8) is very high and the @xmath21 very low .",
    "finally our result ( 14 ) with @xmath32 is surprisingly smaller than the ones expected of @xmath33 or @xmath34 .    for the sample",
    "a and b , given the assumptions of the model of busarello , longo and feoli @xcite , it is clear that triaxiality , anisotropy of the velocity field , inclination , deviations from the @xmath15 law , are all sources of possible errors that could affect the derived kinematical parameters . for the remaining samples we must consider that the masses are not computed with the same method and",
    "often refer to a bulge region that ends to @xmath35 . at the same time",
    "all the velocity dispersions are no longer averaged until the effective semimajor axis of each galaxy .",
    "so the nonhomogeneity of the measurements and the differences in the part of the galaxy that each single measure now considers , can affect also the results obtained with the new set of data .",
    "of course a rigorous analysis will be possible only when the observational uncertainties in all quantities are reduced and the sample is further extended .",
    "however , though with the caution due to all these possible error sources , the study of the relationship we propose between the rest energy of a smbh and the kinetic energy of random motions of the host galaxy appears to be very useful for a more complete understanding of the formation and evolution of smbh not only in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we are grateful to gaetano scarpetta , antonio donofrio and nicola de cesare for useful comments and franco caprio for helpful suggestions about computer programs . the research was partially supported by far fund of the university of sannio .",
