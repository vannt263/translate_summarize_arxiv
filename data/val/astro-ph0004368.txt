    "emission from h@xmath0o masers has been found in a few galaxies , exhibiting apparent isotropic luminosities a million times higher than in typical stellar masers @xcite .",
    "the detection rate of these megamasers is very low , i.e.  about 5% among seyfert galaxies @xcite and almost zero among radio galaxies ( e.g. ,  ) .",
    "the maser is associated with dense and warm material , possibly a molecular torus or disk , around an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the agn apparently produces the seed radio photons and the x - ray photons needed to pump the masing material @xcite .    with the help of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) megamasers",
    "can be used to investigate the small - scale structure of an agn in great detail . in the case of ngc  4258",
    "this has helped to establish the presence of a thin , warped disk around the nucleus , to determine the black hole mass , and even to measure the precise distance to this galaxy @xcite .",
    "finding new megamaser galaxies is therefore of prime interest .",
    "the only clear trend that has emerged in recent years is that megamasers are exclusively found in type 2 agn , i.e.  those seyferts and liners which are expected to be obscured by a molecular torus according to the unified scheme @xcite .",
    "many have high absorbing column depths inferred from x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "there is also an indication of an excess of megamasers in highly inclined galaxies @xcite .",
    "here we report the discovery of a hitherto undetected and very luminous megamaser in the seyfert galaxy mrk  348 during a radio flare of the agn .",
    "mrk  348 ( ngc  262 , @xmath6 , luminosity distance @xmath7 mpc for @xmath8 converted into the galactic standard of rest and @xmath9 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 ) , is a well - studied seyfert 2 galaxy with broad emission - lines in polarized light @xcite .",
    "the galaxy is classified as an s0 with a rather low inclination ( @xmath10 , see ) .",
    "ground - based @xcite and hubble space telescope imaging @xcite have revealed a dust lane crossing the nucleus and an excitation cone in emission - lines .",
    "ginga observations found hard x - ray emission and a high absorbing column depth of @xmath11 towards the nucleus @xcite .",
    "all this suggests the presence of an obscuring torus in mrk  348 .",
    "attempts to detect the obscuring material through radio spectroscopy have failed so far ( e.g.  h i , ) .",
    "what makes this galaxy stand out among seyfert galaxies is its bright and variable radio nucleus .",
    "found a compact radio core on vlbi scales with a flux density of several hundred milli - jansky and a flat to inverted spectrum .",
    "presented more recent vlbi observations for two epochs , showing a two - component structure expanding with sub - relativistic speeds .",
    "they also noted a flare of the radio continuum emission at 15 ghz with the flux rising from 120 mjy to 570 mjy between 1997.10 and 1998.75 . in the following we will present and discuss results of k - band radio spectroscopy of this galaxy .",
    "data were taken in march and april 2000 , using the effelsberg 100 m telescope of the mpifr equipped with a dual channel k - band hemt receiver .",
    "the system temperature was of order 70k on a @xmath12 temperature scale ; the beam size was 40@xmath13 .",
    "the data were recorded using an autocorrelator with 8 @xmath14 256 channels and bandwidths of 80mhz each .",
    "the eight backends were configured in two groups of four , sampling the two orthogonal linear polarizations .",
    "frequency shifts between the four backends representing a given linear polarization were adjusted in such a way that a total velocity range of 3000kms@xmath3 could be covered .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a dual beam switching mode ( switching frequency 1hz ) with a beam throw of 121@xmath13 in azimuth . only linear baselines were subtracted .",
    "calibration was obtained by measurements of w3oh ( 3.2jy according to ) .",
    "pointing could be checked on mrk  348 itself and was found to be stable to within 57@xmath13 .",
    "the galaxy was initially observed to look for ammonia ( nh@xmath5 ) and cyclopropenylidene ( c@xmath5h@xmath0 ) absorption against the bright radio nucleus .",
    "no absorption features were found .",
    "the transitions , rest frequencies , and upper limits of these observations are listed in table [ abslines ] .    .[abslines ] upper limits for absorption lines measured towards the nucleus of mrk  348 .",
    "( 1 )  molecule and transition observed ; col .",
    "( 2 )  rest frequency of transition in ghz ; col . ( 3 )  channel width in km s@xmath3 ; col .",
    "( 4 )  upper limits ( 1@xmath15 ) for flux per channel in mjy .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the h@xmath0o ( @xmath16 ) transition is very close we also observed the redshifted 22.23508 ghz line and detected an emission feature on march 17 .",
    "we repeated the observations on five subsequent days and detected the line each time .",
    "the six spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ h2ospec ] .",
    "we also produced a combined spectrum of all days ( fig .",
    "[ specall ] , top ) and fitted the h@xmath0o line with a gaussian profile .",
    "a one component fit yields a central velocity of @xmath17 km s@xmath3 for the line , which is redshifted by 133 km s@xmath3 from the systemic velocity .",
    "the peak flux is @xmath18 mjy with a full width at half maximum of @xmath19 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the integrated flux is 4.71@xmath20 jy km s@xmath3 , yielding an apparent isotropic luminosity of 420 @xmath21 .",
    "a two component fit yields a narrow line at @xmath22 km s@xmath3 with @xmath23 km s@xmath3 and @xmath24 mjy plus a broad line with @xmath25 km s@xmath3 , @xmath26 km s@xmath3 , and @xmath27 mjy .",
    "the latter fit indicates that the line is asymmetric and has a pronounced blue wing .",
    "if we compare our two best spectra from 17 march and 5 april we tentatively find some variability in the shape of this blue wing .",
    "we searched for additional high velocity features and did not detect anything down to a limit of 6 mjy ( 1@xmath15 , 4 km s@xmath3 ) in the range 3250 to 6200 km s@xmath3 and down to a limit of 10 - 15 mjy in the range @xmath28 to 10480 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the continuum flux density we find at 22 ghz is @xmath29 jy , corresponding to @xmath30 watt hz@xmath3 .",
    "we also reduced some archival data of earlier observations of mrk  348 taken between october 1997 and february 1998 and combined them into one data set ( fig .",
    "[ specall ] , bottom ) . in this spectrum",
    "the broad line is marginally detected with a flux density approximately three times lower than in the current observations .",
    "the smaller and variable baseline in these earlier observations made a reliable identification of this line impossible without _ a priori _ information .",
    "we have clearly discovered a new megamaser in mrk  348 .",
    "its luminosity is comparable to the emission from ngc  3079 which contains the second most luminous h@xmath0o maser after txs  2226 - 184 @xcite .",
    "the line width is among the broadest found for a megamaser , similar to the masers in txs  2226 - 184 and ngc  1052 . assuming the emission is associated with material close to the center this is the first spectroscopic evidence for molecular gas possibly obscuring the nucleus .    despite the bright radio continuum and the molecular maser line",
    "we have found no absorption lines from either nh@xmath5 or c@xmath5h@xmath0 .",
    "this is in line with the earlier non - detection of h i absorption @xcite .",
    "c@xmath5h@xmath0 is an organic ring molecule which is widespread in the galaxy and is associated with diffuse gas in the ism @xcite .",
    "it was also found in absorption against the nucleus of the radio galaxy centaurus a @xcite . from our non - detection",
    "we find a 1@xmath15 upper limit for the optical depth @xmath31 times the covering factor @xmath32 of @xmath33 .",
    "this is seven times smaller than the value found for centaurus a and might be related to the fact that we see mrk  348 almost face on .    on the other hand , with its type 2 agn , polarized broad emission - lines , and",
    "a nuclear dust lane seen , mrk  348 falls right into the roster of typical megamaser galaxies , where it is suggested that the masing material is part of the obscuring ` torus ' in the unified scheme of agn .",
    "the face - on orientation of mrk  348 then would suggest that the axis of this torus and the galaxy disk axis are severely misaligned .    in october 1997 ",
    "february 1998 the flux density of the line was three times lower than it was in march 2000 . in the earlier survey by the maser line",
    "was not detected and given its line width and low flux density it would have resulted only in a broad feature at the @xmath34 level .",
    "linear interpolation with time of the continuum flux density given in suggests a continuum flux density for mrk  348 around 310 mjy in october 1997 at 15 ghz .",
    "the level we measure is roughly a factor of three higher  assuming a flat spectrum  and this increase in flux density is similar to the increase in flux density of the line .",
    "this could indicate a correlation between continuum and maser flux density , implying an unsaturated maser . with its current radio luminosity",
    "the galaxy is now the most radio luminous megamaser galaxy ever discovered .",
    "the response of the line to the continuum flare within about 2 years sets an upper limit to the distance of the masers from the nucleus of @xmath350.6 pc , which is of similar order as the size scale of the molecular disk found in ngc  4258 .    indeed , noted a certain excess of detected megamaser galaxies with large radio powers .",
    "mrk  348 certainly adds to this trend .",
    "the distribution of radio powers at 6 cm of the parent samples of agn selected by has a peak around @xmath36 watt / hz . if we add mrk  348 and more recently discovered megamasers @xcite and also complement the radio data in with more recent data from the nasa extragalactic database , we find that 12 out of 19 detected megamaser galaxies are at or above the peak in the distribution of radio power for galaxies without megamaser detections .    because of the possibly biased selection of the detected megamasers this is not highly significant .",
    "however , it highlights an apparently necessary prerequisite for megamaser emission , namely an agn with a compact radio core to provide seed photons .",
    "so far all detected megamasers have compact ( @xmath37 ) , mostly flat - spectrum , radio emission at a level of a few milli - jansky . in some cases , like mrk  348 @xcite ,",
    "ngc  1052 @xcite , mrk  1210 @xcite , ngc  2639 @xcite , ngc  3079 @xcite , ngc  5793 @xcite , ngc  5506 @xcite , and possibly ngc  4945 @xcite the radio cores can even reach several tens to hundreds of milli - jansky",
    ".    while compact radio cores in seyfert and liner galaxies are not uncommon , only very few are so prominent as those in some of the radio - bright megamaser sources .",
    "we find that all megamasers mentioned above , i.e.  more than a third of known megamasers , have compact radio cores above a fiducial limit of 25 mjy at 5 ghz . on the other hand , in a survey of spiral galaxies find only 3 out of 54 galaxies ( 22 of which are seyfert galaxies ) with compact cores above 25 mjy at 5 ghz .",
    "similarly , in a survey of nearby agn find roughly 40% of seyfert and liner galaxies to contain compact flat - spectrum radio cores .",
    "however , only three out of 48 galaxies have flux densities @xmath3825 mjy . known megamasers therefore seem to prefer galaxies with relatively bright compact radio emission .",
    "mrk  348 currently has the brightest and most prominent radio core among megamaser galaxies .",
    "morphology , spectrum , and variability of the core are very similar to the radio core in iii  zw  2 which was the first seyfert galaxy discovered to contain a superluminal jet .",
    "this galaxy has a millimeter - peaked spectrum and a jet which shows a stop - and - go behavior indicative of a strong interaction with dense material on the sub - parsec scale @xcite .",
    "therefore speculate whether the bright inverted radio core in mrk  348 could be interpreted similarly to those in compact symmetric objects ( csos ) with a gigahertz - peaked - spectrum ( gps , see ) . in these galaxies",
    "bright hotspots are formed in a jet that terminates already on the parsec scale . in iii",
    "zw  2 and mrk  348 this seems to happen on even smaller scales , leading to higher peak frequencies and could be due to frustration of the jet by a molecular cloud or even a warped or misaligned torus .    since the masers in ngc  1052 , which have similar broad line widths as in mrk  348 ,",
    "are found along the radio jet @xcite it should be checked whether in mrk  348 one has an analogous situation .",
    "one can speculate that in such a case the evolution of the radio flare and the evolution of the maser flare and its blue wing could be related , possibly providing a unique diagnostic tool to study jet - ism interactions .    in any case",
    ", with its bright radio core mrk  348 provides an ideal opportunity to observe the maser lines in this galaxy at high resolution with vlbi during this flare even though the lines still have a rather low flux .",
    "since radio and maser emission seem to be highly variable both should be monitored frequently . given that mrk  348 was not discovered in an earlier survey this finding also suggests that existing samples should be revisited to search for more flaring megamasers .",
    "we thank alan roy for helpful discussions .",
    "we are grateful to jim ulvestad for a prompt referee report and useful suggestions .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by jpl , caltech , under contract with nasa ."
