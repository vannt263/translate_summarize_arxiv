    "a number of young , dense star clusters have been observed within the inner few hundred parsecs of the galactic center .",
    "best known are the arches cluster ( object 17 , nagata et al .",
    "1995 ) and the quintuplet cluster ( afgl2004 , nagata et al . 1990",
    "; okuda et al .",
    "however , it is likely that others exist , as these clusters lie behind thick layers of obscuring material ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "most are expected to be invisible at optical wavelengths , but should be readily detectable in the infrared ( vrba et al .",
    "2000 ) or in the 2mass survey dutra & bica 2000 ) .    the arches and the quintuplet clusters are the galactic counterparts of r136 , the central star cluster in ngc2070 : the 30doradus region in the large magellanic cloud ( massey & hunter 1998 ) .",
    "the structural parameters of these clusters  masses , radii , and density profiles are quite similar , as are their ages .",
    "r136 , however , is located far from the perturbing influence of the galaxy and the tidal effect of the lmc is negligible ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "the arches and the quintuplet clusters , on the other hand , lie at projected distances of @xmath2pc of the galactic center , and their evolution is strongly affected by the galactic tidal field .",
    "we study the evolution of clusters like arches and quintuplet using a fully self - consistent star - cluster model in which the dynamics of stars are followed by direct integration and the evolution of individual stars and binaries are followed using a stellar and binary evolution program .",
    "the importance of the tidal field of the galaxy is studied by repeating each model calculations at several distances from the galactic center .",
    "we compare the results of our calculations with detailed observations of the arches cluster and with model calculations performed by others .",
    "we find that , while all our models start with a mass function comparable to that in the solar neighborhood , to an observer the current mass function may well appear to be much flatter .",
    "the unusually flat mass functions observed in both the arches and the quintuplet clusters may therefore in part be attributed to a combination of observational selection effect , the age of the cluster and the location at which the measurements were taken .",
    "the star clusters studied in this paper experience core collapse within a few million years . during this phase and at later time many stars experience collisions with other stars .",
    "the clusters finally dissolve in the tidal field of the galaxy .",
    "the disruption of the cluster is driven mostly by tidal stripping and two - body relaxation .",
    "stellar evolution plays only a minor role in the disruption of the clusters .",
    "the clusters expand as they age , causing their surface densities to decline .",
    "clusters older than about 5myr often have surface densities below that of their surroundings , making these clusters virtually undetectable .",
    "since the modeled clusters disrupt at ages greater than 5 myr , we estimate that there may be many clusters like the arches and quintuplet , but only the youngest are observable .",
    "this suggests that the formation of arches and quintuplet - like clusters may be a continuous process .",
    "we can not exclude , however , that these clusters were formed in a recent burst of star formation and that older counterparts do not exist .",
    "the numerical methods and selection of the initial conditions are discussed in sec.2 .",
    "the results are presented in sec.3 and discussed in sec.4 .",
    "we summarize and conclude in sec.5 .",
    "the portion of the simulations is carried out using the kira integrator operating within the `` starlab '' software environment .",
    "time integration of stellar orbits is accomplished using a fourth - order hermite scheme ( makino & aarseth 1992 ) .",
    "kira also incorporates block time steps ( mcmillan 1986ab ; makino 1991 ) special treatment of close two - body and multiple encounters of arbitrary complexity , and a robust treatment of stellar and binary evolution and stellar collisions .",
    "the special - purpose grape-4 ( makino et al.1997 ) system is used to accelerate the computation of gravitational forces between stars .",
    "the treatment of stellar mass loss is described by portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . a concise description of the starlab environment is given by portegies zwart et al .  ( 2001b , ) ; additional information is available at http://manybody.org .",
    "evolution of stars and binaries is handled using the prescription given by portegies zwart & verbunt ( 1996 , sec.2.1 ) .",
    "however , some changes are made to the treatment of main - sequence mass loss in massive stars ( see portegies zwart et al .",
    "1999 , hereafter ) , and we incorporate a more extended prescription for stellar collisions , as described by portegies zwart , hut & verbunt ( 1997 ) .",
    "the system of units used internally in the @xmath3-body models is defined by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the initial internal energy of the stellar system , @xmath6 is the total mass in stars and @xmath7 is the gravitational constant ( heggie & mathieu 1986 ) .    the time required for a star to cross the clusters virial radius  is @xmath8    for the runs considered here , the and physical length scales are connected by the requirement that initially the star cluster is in virial equilibrium and exactly fills its zero - velocity surface in the galactic tidal field ( see sec .  [ sect : tidal ] below ) .",
    "once the cluster mass and distance to the galactic center are known , the clusters size scale is determined .",
    "the half mass crossing time ( @xmath9 ) can then be expressed in convenient physical units as @xmath10 \\over m } \\right)^{1/2 }            \\left ( { { \\mbox{${r_{\\rm hm}}$}}\\over [ { \\rm pc}]}\\right)^{3/2 } \\ , \\unit{myr}. \\label{eq : crossing_time}\\ ] ] for most density profiles the half - mass radius is slightly ( @xmath11% ) smaller than .",
    "the half - mass relaxation time is calculated as ( spitzer 1987 ) : @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the coulomb logarithm ; @xmath14 is a scaling factor introduced to model the effects of the cut - off in the long range coulomb logarithm ( see giersz & heggie 1996 ; 1994 ) .",
    "we will also use the relaxation time at the tidal radius , for which we use eq.[eq : trlx ] but with the tidal radius substituted for .",
    "the two clusters on which we concentrate here , the arches and the quintuplet , lie in projection within @xmath15pc of the galactic center .",
    "table[tab : observed ] lists some observed parameters of these clusters , along with some other clusters ( and cluster candidates ) having comparable characteristics . all",
    "have masses of @xmath16 , are very compact , @xmath17pc , and are only a few million years old .",
    "however , of the systems listed , only the arches and quintuplet are significantly perturbed by external tidal fields .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : arches ]      figure[fig : rvir_rhosq ] shows the projected density profile of our model clusters with = 4 for stars having masses @xmath18 at various instants .",
    "the data are presented in virial units ( horizontal axis in units of , and the vertical axis in units of stars per @xmath19 ) .",
    "the various curves ( and symbols ) represent the density distribution of the model clusters at zero age ( solid line ) , at @xmath20 initial relaxation times ( dashes ) , and at @xmath21(dotted line ) .",
    "mass segregation causes the density profile of the older clusters to steepen with time , tidal stripping causes the global density to decrease .",
    "the open squares in fig.[fig : rvir_rhosq ] present the observed density distribution for the arches cluster ( figer et al .",
    "these data are given in arc seconds ( or parsec when scaled to the appropriate distance ) .",
    "we plot them on the same figure assuming that the observed median radius of 0.18pc ( 4.5 arc seconds ) corresponds to 0.18 , i.e. : that the virial radius of the arches cluster is 1pc",
    ". this may be an overestimate , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "there is some freedom in shifting the observed points along the arrow , which then changes the scaling for the cluster .",
    "the observed points fit best with the dashed line and are not consistent with the solid ( zero age ) or the dotted ( @xmath22 ) lines .",
    "the projected density profile of the observed arches cluster thus suggests an age of about @xmath23 , in agreement with our findings in sec.[sect : mass_function ] .",
    "the arches cluster is located at a projected distance of @xmath24pc from the galactic center , the quintuplet at @xmath25pc .",
    "these measurements provide lower limits to the true distances of these clusters from the center .",
    "the mean density within the jacobi radius of a tidally limited cluster is proportional to the local stellar density .",
    "( this is not a matter of definition  it happens to be true for point - mass fields if one averages the point mass over @xmath26 , and for the power - law density profiles we consider here , since the tidal field @xmath27 , but it is not in general the case . )",
    "thus , a cluster closer to the galactic center is more compact , has a shorter relaxation time , and therefore evolves more rapidly than a similar cluster at a greater distance .",
    "most of our 34pc models have densities higher than any of the observed clusters listed in tab.[tab : observed ] ( see fig.[fig : spz_w147r34n12k_trl ] ) . only the model with an extremely shallow initial density profile ( r34w1 )",
    "has density comparable to the observed systems .",
    "clusters at greater distances from the galactic center ( but with the same projected distance ) have lower densities . since the densities of the 34pc models are too high by at least a factor of two , this suggests that the real clusters are somewhat farther out , at @xmath28pc ; a factor of 2 in density corresponds to a factor of @xmath29 in radius , so the true galactocentric distance should exceed 43 pc .",
    "figure[fig : spz_w17r34_rho_phm ] plots the evolution of the mean surface density within the projected half - mass radius for models r34w7 ( dots ) , r90w4 ( dashes ) and r150w1 ( solid ) , which brackets the central densities of the models .",
    "we view the clusters along the @xmath30-axis , so we look through the second and first lagrangian points toward the galactic center , giving the highest possible cluster density and hence an overestimate of the true density contrast ( see fig.[fig : spz_w147 ] ) .",
    "the two error bars give the projected half - mass densities for the arches ( left ) , and the quintuplet ( right ) clusters .",
    "the horizontal dotted lines give the background surface densities a projected distances of 34pc , 90pc and 150pc from the galactic center .",
    "the surface density at projected distance @xmath31 from the galactic center can be calculated by integrating the local stellar density @xmath32 ( eq.[eq : rhogal ] ) along the line of sight to the cluster : @xmath33 integrating eq.[eq : projectddensity ] from -100 to 100pc ( the range of validity of the mezgers equation ) gives the projected surface densities towards the arches ( at @xmath34pc ) and quintuplet cluster ( at @xmath35pc ) .",
    "we integrate eq.[eq : projectddensity ] numerically .",
    "figures[fig : density ] and [ fig : los_gc ] illustrate this .",
    "an extra correction for stars between 100pc from the galactic center and earth adds little ( @xmath36% ) to the total ( bahcall & soneira 1980 ) .",
    "the projected densities of the observed clusters are comparable to the background .",
    "clusters with lower background densities may well remain unnoticed among the background stars .",
    "note , however , that the background stellar population is probably older than the star clusters studied here , and may therefore have a smaller mass - to - light ratio , making the clusters stand out somewhat better .",
    "this may be the reason that the quintuplet was found even though its projected density is smaller than that of the background .",
    "figure[fig : density ] shows eq.[eq : projectddensity ] and eq.[eq : rhogal ] both normalized to their value at @xmath37pc , which are @xmath38pc@xmath39 and @xmath40pc@xmath41 .",
    "the projected density of model r150w1 remains well below the background , and such a cluster could easily remain unseen throughout its entire lifetime .",
    "the two initially more concentrated models , r90w4 and r34w7 , have projected densities above the background , at least initially .",
    "the cluster farther from the galactic center has a lower initial density because it is more extended ; after the first few million years , it may become hard to see .",
    "the observation of the quintuplet provides an upper limit on the critical contrast below which the cluster can not be detected .",
    "we arbitrarily adopt a minimum contrast equals to the surface density of the quintuplet cluster ( i.e. @xmath42pc@xmath39 ) as a threshold for distinguishing a star cluster from the background . in that case",
    ", the 150pc cluster would be invisible for its entire lifetime , while the 34pc and the 90pc clusters remain visible for about @xmath43 million years ( @xmath44% and @xmath11% of their respective lifetimes ) .",
    "thus , although the clusters farther from the galactic center live much longer , their visible lifetime is actually less than that of a cluster at smaller galactocentric radius .",
    "although not shown in fig.[fig : spz_w17r34_rho_phm ] , the surface density evolution of model r34w1 is also consistent with the densities of the observed clusters . on these grounds",
    "we therefore can not exclude the possibility that the arches and quintuplet systems lie at galactocentric distances of 34pc , but in that case they must have been born with very shallow density profiles ( which , however , would contradict our earlier analysis from sec.[sect : mass_function ] , see tab.[tab : arches ] ) .",
    "the surface mass density as presented in fig.[fig : spz_w17r34_rho_phm ] may not be the ideal way to express the visibility of these clusters ; a luminosity density contrasted with the background would be more appropriate .",
    "this , however , requires a detailed study of the observational selection effects , which goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "another way to illustrate the visibility of clusters like arches is by looking at the integrated visual luminosity of these clusters ( see fig.[fig : tl_w4150 ] ) .",
    "the arches and the quintuplet are among the youngest star clusters known in the galaxy . they are not as rich as small globular clusters , but are considerably more compact .",
    "their central densities are comparable to those of the densest  post collapse ",
    "globulars , but their life expectancies are only a few tens of millions of years .",
    "these clusters are destroyed by tidal forces , accelerated by impulsive mass loss from supernovae ( after @xmath45 myr ) and strong binary activity . in the following we",
    "first focus on comparison with other calculations ; we then discuss the consequences of our results for the inferred distances of the arches and quintuplet clusters from the galactic center , and for the number of such clusters which may be hidden near the galactic center .",
    "portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1999 , ) studied the evolution of r136 in the lmc using simulations .",
    "their initial conditions were comparable to those adopted here , although small differences exist .",
    "they adopted king models with @xmath46 , whereas we selected @xmath47 and @xmath48 .    the calculations in included the effects of stellar evolution and physical collisions between stars , but neglected the effect of the galactic tidal field and the possible presence of primordial binaries .",
    "both may have a profound effect on a cluster s dynamical evolution . for r136 the neglect of a tidal field may be appropriate , but for the arches and quintuplet clusters the tidal field is crucial .",
    "our clusters therefore dissolve much more rapidly than the calculations in .",
    "the latter models lost only a few percent of their mass within the first relaxation time , where our models lose up to @xmath49% on this time scale , confirming the strong influence of the galactic tidal field .",
    "portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found that physical collisions between stars in their models were frequent , and that the evolution of the most massive stars and the dynamical evolution of the cluster were closely coupled . in all cases ,",
    "a single star grew steadily in mass through mergers with other stars , forming a very massive ( @xmath50 ) star in less than 34 myr .",
    "the growth rate of this runaway merger was much larger than estimates based on simple cross - section arguments , mainly because the star was typically found in the core and tended to form binaries with other massive stars there .",
    "we observe the same general behavior in our calculations , in the sense that collisions tend to occur between high - mass ( @xmath51 ) stars and that most collisions occur repeatedly with the same star . although not discussed in detail in this paper , we find the same trend in our calculations and confirm the findings of portegies zwart et al .",
    "kim , morris & lee ( 1999 ; kml99 ) performed 2-d calculations of dense star clusters near the galactic center and studied the lifetimes of the arches and the quintuplet clusters .",
    "their calculations are somewhat different than those presented in this paper in the sense that they only solve the two dimensional equation instead of the equation of motions for all stars in the stellar system .",
    "kml99 include standard binary heating",
    "( lee et al .",
    "1991 ) in their calculations and neglect stellar collisions .",
    "we selected the most representative cases of kml99 and recalculated these with our model .",
    "the fokker planck models dissolve much more rapidly ( often more than a factor two in lifetime ) than the models ( see fig.[fig : pzvskea ] ) .",
    "similar discrepancies are observed in the comparison between the fokker - planck calculations of chernoff & weinberg ( 1990 ) and the calculations of fukushige & heggie ( 1995 ) and portegies zwart et al .",
    "the discrepancies are the result of the rather simple treatment of escapers in the fokker - planck models , which can drive the evaporation of the cluster on a shorter time scale then when a self - consistent tidal field is used ( see takahashi & portegies zwart 1998 for details ) .",
    "an extra complication is introduced in the calculations of kml99 by selecting a maximum mass of 150 in the initial mass function .",
    "such stars dominate the early evolution of the star cluster while their behavior can not accurately be represented with a statistical average as is done in a fokker - planck solver .",
    "part of the spread in the fokker - planck results in fig.[fig : pzvskea ] may be attributed to these effects .",
    "kim et al . ( 2000 ) also perform n - body calculations of several of the models explored by kml99 using aarseths ( 1999 ) nbody6 .",
    "they also find that the n - body models live longer than the fokker - planck models , but arrive at the same conclusion as kml99 : the arches and quintuplet star clusters must have unusually flat initial mass function and dissolve within about 10myr .",
    "the results of kml99 are completely understandable from their choice of initial conditions .",
    "many of their calculations start with a power - law initial mass function with and exponent as flat as -1.5 ( salpeter @xmath52 ) and omitting all stars with a mass smaller than 1 . together with a small number of stars of only a few thousand , their models have an initial relaxation time at the tidal radius of only @xmath53 to 60myr .",
    "the lifetime of these clusters is therefore expected to be only a few million years .",
    "figure[fig : pzvskea ] compares the results of our calculations ( @xmath54 and triangles ) with the fokker - plank calculations of kml99 ( @xmath55 ) , the n - body calculations of kim et al .",
    "( 2000 , squares ) . for comparison",
    "we added the results of the analytic model presented by portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2001a ) as a solid line .",
    "the lowest values of our models ( lower @xmath54 for each ) are computed with @xmath56 , which dissolve somewhat quicker than the more concentrated models .",
    "the lifetime of the models start to depend on @xmath3 via the coulomb logarithm ( see eq.[eq : trlx ] ) when the number of stars in the models drops below a few thousand . in this small",
    "@xmath3 limit the scaling proposed by portegies zwart et al ( 2001a ) probably breaks down .",
    "this effect may cause our models with the shortest initial relaxation times to live longer than expected ( leftmost triangles in fig.[fig : pzvskea ] ) .",
    "a similar effect may cause the models of kim et al.(2000 , open squares ) to have somewhat shorter lifetimes than expected , as most of their models contain less than 3000 stars .",
    "part of the discrepancy at small @xmath3 and therefore at small relaxation times may also be caused by statistical fluctuations , which become most noticeable at small @xmath3 .",
    "although the arches and quintuplet clusters are very dense , it may still be difficult to distinguish them near the galactic center .",
    "the three - dimensional density contrast is several orders of magnitude , as can be seen in fig.[fig : spz_w147r34n12k_trl ] . in projection on the sky , however , the density contrast is reduced , due mainly to the accumulation of stars along the line of sight ( see fig.[fig : spz_w17r34_rho_phm ] ) .",
    "the cluster density within the projected half - mass radius also decreases with time , so these clusters are more easily seen at early ages than at later times . as outlined in sec.[sect : rgc ] , to estimate the time over which our model clusters would be observable , we simply compare the integrated stellar density @xmath57 along the line of sight to the cluster ( eq.[eq : projectddensity ] ) with the projected stellar densities of the models .    in section[sect :",
    "rgc ] we introduced a limiting density contrast above which a cluster can be discriminated from the background stars , and used this to estimate the time during which our models would be detectable . at a galactocentric distance of 34pc ,",
    "our most compact models ( r34w7 ) remain visible for @xmath58myr ; at 90pc they become invisible after about 7,myr and at a distance of 150pc from the galactic center they remain invisible for their entire lifetime .",
    "models at greater distances from the galactic center , or those born with shallower density profiles , remain undetectable for their entire life times .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the clusters we observe near the galactic center are extremely compact and very young .",
    "less compact or older clusters are unobservable due to their low surface density contrasts .",
    "portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 2001a ) studied the time scale over which clusters such as arches and the quintuplet systems remain visible .",
    "the results of their detailed n - body calculations are used to calibrate a simple analytical model which is applicable over a wider range of cluster initial conditions .",
    "they conclude that clusters within 200pc of the galactic center dissolve within @xmath59 myr .",
    "however , their projected densities drop below the background density in the direction of the galactic center within @xmath60myr , effectively making these clusters undetectable after that time .",
    "clusters farther from the galactic center but at the same projected distance are more strongly affected by this selection effect , and may go undetected for their entire lifetimes .",
    "based on these findings , they conclude that the region within 200 pc of the galactic center could easily harbor some 50 clusters with properties similar to those of the arches or the quintuplet systems .",
    "the results of our more extended parameter study is consistent with their findings . given the higher mass we derive for the arches cluster ( see tab.[tab : arches ] ) compared to what was adopted by portegies zwart et al ( 2001a ) we argue that their results may even be somewhat conservative .    another effect which may contribute to the difficulty in detecting clusters like the arches is the enormous range in luminosity of the brightest stars .",
    "ccd cameras have a dynamic range of less than @xmath61 = 64k , causing the brightest stars to saturate the detector and preventing faint stars from being detected .",
    "however , these brightest stars are also the least common ; only with very deep exposures is the rest of the cluster revealed .",
    "thus , wherever two or more bright blue stars are seen together , there may be an entire star cluster lurking in the background .",
    "an example of such a cluster may be the small group of stars identified as r140 ergs@xmath62 x - ray source , possibly a colliding wind binary ( portegies zwart et al .",
    "2001c ) . ] .",
    "figure[fig : tl_w4150 ] presented the integrated luminosity for two representative models ( r90w4 and r150w4 ) . in these models the total luminosity dropped by more than two orders of magnitude over the lifespan of the cluster .",
    "the individual high peaks are the results of single stars which become extremely bright as a result of their rejuvenation in several collisions .",
    "such stars can temporarily outshine the rest of the star cluster .",
    "of course , the luminosity and the lifetime of such a multiple collision product is quite sensitive to details in modeling the collision process .",
    "we have studied the evolution of young , dense star clusters near the galactic center , taking the arches and quintuplet clusters as specific examples .",
    "these clusters are generally referred to as `` young , '' because they are only a few million years old , and indeed , even in a dynamical sense both clusters are quite young , having lifetimes considerably smaller than their initial relaxation times . however , by observing only the most massive stars in these clusters the dynamical image sketched by the observers is biased toward greater age , as the massive stars evolve dynamically on shorter time scales than average cluster members . by observing only stars with @xmath63 , one selects a part of the cluster that is dynamically rather mature , being comparable in age to the local initial relaxation time .",
    "this makes the arches cluster ( and probably also the quintuplet ) appear dynamically older than it really is . we can not test this hypothesis for the quintuplet system because the available data are of lower quality than for the arches",
    "the modeled clusters lose mass at a more - or - less constant rate , inversely proportional to the initial relaxation time , i.e. @xmath64 ( see also portegies zwart et al .",
    "star clusters which are born farther from the galactic center live therefore considerably longer than those closer in .",
    "the relaxation time derived from observation , however , contains little information about the initial relaxation time .",
    "mass segregation in our model clusters quickly causes the most massive stars to sink to the cluster center . as",
    "a result core collapse occurs within about two million years , even for models as shallow as = 1 . during core collapse",
    "close binaries are formed and collisions between stars are frequent .",
    "the collision rate is much higher than would be expected from simple cross section arguments , due to mass segregation and binary formation .",
    "we confirm the finding of portegies zwart et al .",
    "( 1999 ) that the most massive stars are generally involved in a collision runaway , in which few low mass stars participate .",
    "this process continues until the runaway product is ejected by a supernova or a strong encounter with a binary or the cluster dissolves in the tidal field of the galaxy .    by comparing mass functions from our models at various distances from the cluster center with observations of the arches mass function ,",
    "we conclude that the age of the arches cluster must be about 0.05 . with an age of about 1.5myr",
    "the initial relaxation time of the cluster is then about 30myr . to reconcile the observed mass function with the observed density distribution of the arches ,",
    "we conclude that the cluster must be about @xmath65 and lie some 50  90pc from the galactic center . with these parameters",
    "we can reproduce the observed density distribution and the observed mass function for stars between 10 and 50 without requiring an unusually flat initial mass function .",
    "the top end of the mass function contains more stars than our adopted mass function and this may require a flatter @xmath66 ( salpeter @xmath52 ) initial mass function for stars @xmath67 .",
    "however , we still conclude that the arches cluster can be explained with a `` normal '' mass function .",
    "most of the observed flattening of the mass function can be attributed to selection effects caused by the limited range in distance from the cluster center in which the observations were made .",
    "the young clusters we discussed expand as they become older , causing their surface densities and total luminosity to drop .",
    "clusters which are older than about 5myr often have surface densities below that of their surrounding , making these clusters virtually undetectable . by comparing the projected density of the model clusters with that of the field stars in the direction of the galactic center",
    "we conclude that the region within 200 pc of the galactic center could easily harbor some 50 clusters with properties similar to those of the arches or the quintuplet systems . to find more clusters like arches and quintuplet systems , we urge observers to look for single extremely bright stars",
    ". closer study of the region near such a star may well reveal the underlying star cluster .",
    "finally , with our estimate of about 50 clusters with a mass of @xmath68 each and dissolving within 100myr , we derive a star formation rate near the galactic center of @xmath69 .",
    "clusters like the arches and quintuplet may therefore contribute significantly to the total star formation rate in the galaxy .",

    "<S> we find that clusters within 150pc of the galactic center dissolve within @xmath0 myr , but their projected densities drop below the background density in the direction of the galactic center within only a few myr , effectively making these clusters undetectable after that time . </S>",
    "<S> detailed observations of the arches cluster , taken at face value , suggest that its mass function is unusually flat and that the cluster contains an overabundance of stars more massive than 20 . </S>",
    "<S> our dynamical analysis , however , shows that the observed characteristics of the arches cluster are consistent with a perfectly normal initial mass function . </S>",
    "<S> the observed anomalies are then caused by a combination of observational selection effects and the dynamical evolution of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we calibrate the current parameters of the arches cluster using a normal initial mass function and conclude that the cluster is more massive than 40000 , has a half mass radius of about 0.35pc and is located between 50 and 90pc from the galactic center .    </S>",
