    "stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) represent the final evolutionary stage of low- to intermediate mass stars .",
    "the large agb mass - loss rates play a key role in the cosmic circuit of matter .",
    "this mass loss consists of both gas and ( sub-)micron - sized solid `` dust '' particles .",
    "dust in the circumstellar shells of agb stars leads to a significant change in the overall spectral energy distribution compared to dust - free objects .",
    "it attenuates stellar radiation in the blue and visual range and re - radiates corresponding emission at mid - infrared wavelengths ( ` infrared excess ' ) .",
    "the spectrum of the infrared excess contains broad spectral features characteristic of specific dust species .    up to now",
    ", dust properties of agb stars could be determined only for samples in the galactic disk and bulge ( e.g.  omont et al.2003 ) .",
    "the iras and iso missions created large databases of mid- and far - ir spectra of dust - producing stars .",
    "analysis of these spectra led to basic insights e.g.  into the relation between dust properties and stellar c vs.  o abundances or total mass loss rates ( e.g.  molster & waters 2003 ) .",
    "however , as the disk and bulge samples are inhomogeneous with respect to individual metallicities and masses  which both influence the production of dust ",
    "several questions remained open .",
    "one main open issue concerns the interrelation between the dust composition , stellar variability , and evolutionary status of an agb star .",
    "in contrast to stellar samples in the galactic disk and bulge , globular clusters ( gcs ) make possible observation of stellar samples with well - defined , homogeneous parameters .",
    "among the gcs , 47 tuc ( ngc 104 , [ fe / h]@xmath20.76 , briley et al . 1995 ) is especially suited for a study correlating agb stellar parameters and dust spectral signatures .",
    "this cluster has a well populated agb with indications of dust formation due to considerable ir excesses ( van loon et al .",
    "2006 , ramdani & jorissen 2001 ) .",
    "lebzelter et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and lebzelter & wood ( 2005 ) were able to assign fundamental or overtone pulsation modes to most of the 47 tuc agb variables .",
    "overtone pulsators exclusively populate the lower part of the agb , while fundamental mode pulsators are only found at high luminosities .",
    "the nir velocity amplitude was found to strongly increase during the transition from overtone to fundamental mode and to further increase along the fundamental mode sequence with luminosity . based on these findings , we selected 10 targets distributed over the agb pulsation modes and luminosity range for observation with spitzer .",
    "one star , v13 , shows a short primary and a long secondary period ( lebzelter et al .",
    "2005 ) . to this sample we added v18 , a star located between the fundamental and the overtone mode pulsators with a strong infrared excess ( ramdani & jorissen 2001 ) .",
    "it was suggested by lebzelter et al .",
    "( 2005 ) that this star is currently in the luminosity minimum following a thermal pulse .",
    "the upper left panel of fig .  1 gives an overview on the location of the various variables in the logp-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "for these 11 targets low resolution _ spitzer _",
    "spectra have been obtained between @xmath3 @xmath0 m during cycle 1 .",
    "our spectra are based on the droopres products processed through the s13.2.0 version of the _ spitzer _ data pipeline .",
    "partially based on the smart software package @xcite , these intermediate data products were further processed using spectral extraction tools developed for the `` formation and evolution of planetary systems '' ( feps ) _ spitzer _ science legacy team .",
    "the spectra were extracted using a 6.0 pixel and 5.0 pixel fixed - width aperture in the spatial dimension for the observations with the first order of the short- ( @xmath4 @xmath0 m ) and the second and third order of the long - wavelength ( @xmath5 @xmath0 m ) modules , respectively .",
    "the background was subtracted using associated pairs of imaged spectra from the two nodded positions along the slit , also eliminating stray light contamination and anomalous dark currents .",
    "pixels flagged by the data pipeline as being `` bad '' were replaced with a value interpolated from an 8 pixel perimeter surrounding the errant pixel .",
    "the low - level fringing in the low - resolution spectra at wavelengths longer than 20  @xmath0 m was removed using the irsfinge package @xcite .",
    "the spectra are calibrated using a spectral response function derived from irs spectra and cohen stellar models for a suite of calibrators provided by the _",
    "science centre . to remove any effect of pointing offsets , we matched orders based on the wavelength dependend point spread function of the irs instrument , correcting for possible flux losses .",
    "the relative errors between spectral points within one order are dominated by the noise on each individual point and not by the calibration .",
    "we estimate a relative flux calibration across an order of @xmath6  % and an absolute calibration error between orders / modules of @xmath7  % .",
    "the mid - ir ( mir ) sed consists of a photospheric continuum component and various dust features on top of it . to obtain a clear view on the signatures of the dust we subtracted a blackbody curve representing the photosphere . for this purpose we obtained parallel near infrared photometry ( jhkl ) at siding spring observatory ( sso ) .",
    "the blackbody temperatures ( 3400 - 3900k ) were derived from @xmath8 values using the relation by houdashelt et al .",
    "the flux levels of the blackbodies were chosen such as to fit the near infrared flux levels . for sample stars with low mass loss rates we assume that the infrared excess will not significantly affect @xmath8 .",
    "fig.2 gives an example of a spectrum before and after blackbody subtraction . in the following we will present and discuss only continuum",
    "subtracted spectra .",
    "the chosen continuum subtraction method naturally introduces some uncertainty in the derived residual dust emission , but this uncertainty does not affect the positions and relative strengths of the various dust features on which this paper is focused .",
    "v5 , v6 and v7 can be fitted nicely with single blackbodies of about 3700 to 3900k and must be nearly dust - free .",
    "dust features were detected in the remaining 8 of the 11 sample stars .",
    "the three dominant dust features are located at approximately 9.7 , 11.5 and 13@xmath0 m .",
    "additionally , broad features at 1820@xmath0 m are visible",
    ". however , not all features are visible in all stars . in fig .  1 ,",
    "we show the dust spectra and the location of the corresponding stars in the logp-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "v13 is presented separately in fig .  2 .",
    "from the logp-@xmath1 values we can form three groups among the sample stars .",
    "the spectra of pairs v5/v6 , v4/v8 and v1/v2 are very similar , suggesting a typical spectrum is associated with a specific location in the logp-@xmath1-diagram .",
    "an interesting case is v3 with similar logp-@xmath1 values as v1/v2 .",
    "the v3 spectrum has a very weak dust feature sitting on top of a broad mid - ir emission with a wavelength dependent slope .",
    "this slope can be roughly approximated by a blackbody curve on top of which a weak 9.7@xmath0 m feature stands out . while not obvious , this is the same spectral signature as in v1/v2 . in [ variabi ]",
    "we further discuss these differences as a function of stellar variability .",
    "the change of the dust features along the agb is in agreement with earlier studies on the relation between dust properties and stellar parameters . while previous works on this subject ( e.g.  onaka et al .",
    "1989 , sloan & price 1996 , hron et al .",
    "1997 , heras & hony 2005 ) refer to an inhomogeneous samples of stars , our gc spectra minimize possible effects of such inhomogeneities . at the lower luminosity end of the agb ,",
    "hardly any dust is present .",
    "effective dust production seems to start only after the star reaches the luminosity of v21 corresponding to a value of approximately 2000l@xmath9 ( cf .",
    "lebzelter & wood 2005 ) .",
    "the 13@xmath0 m feature clearly dominates the spectrum at this luminosity .",
    "changing from v21 to v4 brings about a switch in pulsation mode from overtone to fundamental mode and a strong increase in the observed velocity amplitude .",
    "the related change in the mir spectrum is an increase in the 11.5@xmath0 m feature , a decrease in the strength of the 13@xmath0 m , and the occurrence of a 9.7@xmath0 m feature . going to even higher luminosities leads to v1 with its dominating 9.7@xmath0 m feature and only a very weak indication for the 11.5@xmath0 m feature , sitting on the long wavelength side of the 9.7@xmath0 m emission .",
    "summarizing these observations , we can say that the 13@xmath0 m feature appears in the least evolved stars , later looses importance relative to the 11.5@xmath0 m peak and a feature at 9.7@xmath0 m and finally vanishes completely in the highest luminosity stars .",
    "the latter are dominated completely by the 9.7@xmath0 m emission .      among the observed emission bands only the 9.7@xmath0 m feature has a generally accepted identification , amorphous mg - fe - silicate ( see , e.g. , dorschner et al .",
    "1995 for optical constants ) .",
    "no consensus exists on the carriers for the broad 11.5@xmath0 m band , the narrow 13@xmath0 m band , and the various features between 17 and 20@xmath0 m . since the sample stars are all spectral type k or m the dust species must be oxides .    first detected in iras spectra ( little - marenin & little 1988 ) , the 13@xmath0 m band was identified as part of a ` three - component - feature ' consisting of a 9.7 , @xmath1011 , and the 13@xmath0 m band itself .",
    "our spectra of 47 tuc v4 and v8 show the ` three - component - feature ' .",
    "the 13@xmath0 m feature is likely an al - o stretching vibration .",
    "the carrier has been identified as either corundum ( @xmath11-al@xmath12o@xmath13 , glaccum 1995 , depew , speck & dijkstra 2006 ) or spinel ( mgal@xmath12o@xmath14 , posch et al .  1999 ,",
    "fabian et al .",
    "2001 , heras & hony 2005 ) .    the origin of the broad 11.5@xmath0 m band in spectra of o - rich agb stars has been extensively discussed ( e.g.  stencel et al .",
    "1990 , lorenz - martins & pompeia 2000 , egan & sloan 2001 , posch et al.2002 , heras & hony 2005 ) .",
    "although it is especially difficult to identify uniquely such a broad solid state band , there remains little doubt that amorphous al@xmath12o@xmath13 is the band carrier in this case.o@xmath13 is sometimes called ` corundum ' in the literature .",
    "however , this name should be reserved for the crystalline @xmath11-phase of al@xmath12o@xmath13 . ]    the band ( or double - band ) at 1820@xmath0 m is most distinctly seen in v1 ( 18@xmath0 m ) , v4 ( 18 + 20@xmath0 m ) , v8 ( 20@xmath0 m ) , v13 ( 20@xmath0 m ) , v18 ( 18 + 20@xmath0 m ) and v21 ( 20@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the observed differences in the positions of the feature s maxima probably indicate a transition from a crystalline oxide ( with a composition between mgo to feo , see posch et al .",
    "2002 ) as the dominant opacity source in the 19 - 21@xmath0 m region to an amorphous silicate s bending vibration as the primary emission mechanism .",
    "sloan et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found a correlation between the strengths of the 13 and 20@xmath0 m features . in fig .",
    "2 we show the spectrum of v13 with the band identifications for the oxide dust features suggested above . the spectrum of v13 is further discussed in section [ v13v18 ] .      at least for fundamental - mode agb pulsators cyclic",
    "variability leads to significant changes in size and t@xmath15 of the star .",
    "these could effect the observed mir spectra through cyclic changes in both dust production and photospheric flux . from spitzer",
    "we have only one observational epoch for each star .",
    "however , additional information provides indications of the impact on the mid - infrared spectrum .",
    "our sample contains the three miras , v1 , v2 , and v3 , all sharing a similar location in the logp - k - diagram .",
    "their spectra show the same dust features , but with a very different contrast against the photospheric background . from the simultaneous @xmath1 photometry",
    ", we estimate that v1 was observed close to light maximum , while v2 and v3 were close to minima .",
    "we speculate that the background is related to the pulsation phase .",
    "this is seen in model atmospheres ( aringer 2005 ) .",
    "phase dependent background can possibly explain the difference between our spectrum of v8 and one published by van loon et al.(2006 ) . while dust features are quite obvious in the spitzer observation , the van loon spectrum taken from the ground shows no features at all .",
    "the @xmath1 amplitude of v8 is too small to safely estimate the phase from the observed @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "two stars do not seem to fit in the dust evolution scenario described in [ scenario ] : v13 and v18 which both have ir excess emission much too strong in relation to their position in the logp - k diagram . the residual dust emission spectrum of v13 ( fig .",
    "2 ) is almost devoid of a 10@xmath0 m band .",
    "this alone is not surprising , because it also is the case for v21 .",
    "however , v13 is almost 1mag fainter in @xmath1 than v21 .",
    "the spectra of both v13 and v21 are characterized by pronounced 11.5 , 13 and 20@xmath0 m peaks .",
    "v18 shows a spectrum very similar to the mira v1 , i.e.  it is dominated by a 9.7@xmath0 m silicate dust feature , yet is @xmath101.25 magnitude fainter at @xmath1 .",
    "what properties of v13 enable the formation of dust ?",
    "the only remarkable pulsational characteristic of v13 is its long secondary period .",
    "this long period is also clearly visible in the radial velocity ( lebzelter et al .",
    "2005 ) as well as photometric variation .",
    "the length of the secondary period has not be determined accurately but seems to fall onto the wood et al .",
    "( 1999 ) p - l sequence `` d '' .",
    "the interpretation of this sequence in terms of stellar pulsation or binarity is still not clear ( e.g.  wood 2006 ) .",
    "we interpret the dust spectrum of v18 in the light of the earlier suggestion that this star is currently undergoing a thermal pulse event .",
    "v18 would then have an interpulse luminosity and dust spectrum similar to that of an 47 tuc mira , e.g. v1 . according to evolution models of thermally pulsing agb stars by vassiliadis & wood ( 1993 ) ,",
    "a significant disturbance of the typical pulsation period of a star occurs during the thermal pulse ( cf .",
    "their fig.3 ) , which would explain the strange location of v18 in the logp-@xmath1 diagram .",
    "our evolutionary sequence of the dust spectra indicates that oxygen - rich agb stars first form dust rich in oxides of aluminum and magnesium ( specifically , , and ( mg , fe)o- ) .",
    "as a star climbs up the agb , the original aluminum - magnesium oxide dust contributes less to the emergent dust shell spectra , while the relative strength of amorphous silicate bands , especially the one at 9.7@xmath0 m , increases .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with considerations published by stencel et al.(1990 ) linking this evolutionary sequence to the higher electron affinity of al ( compared to si ) to oxygen .",
    "it is the high binding energy of solid al oxides which enables them to condense at much higher temperatures than silicates ( see , e.g. , gail 2003 , fig .  4 ) .",
    "once the al oxides have formed , silicates will start to precipitate on their surfaces which gradually leads to a transition to a silicate dominated dust spectrum .",
    "hron et al .  ( 1997 ) pointed out that the 13@xmath0 m feature reaches significant strength only in a narrow range of effective temperatures and optical depths .",
    "they proposed an evolutionary sequence in the course of which the carrier of this band would be gradually incorporated into amorphous silicates with increasing mass - loss rate .",
    "most recent model calculations by woitke ( a&a submitted ) indicate that al@xmath16o@xmath17 can exist closer to the star while silicates are formed at larger distances , i.e. once effective mass loss has set in .",
    "a similar scenario for aluminum - magnesium oxide / silicate dust evolution has been proposed by onaka et al .",
    "they derive a relation between the asymmetry factor of the light curve and the importance of the various dust features with the stars exhibiting the strongest asymmetries showing the most pronounced silicate emission .",
    "the asymmetry of the light curve can be related to the strengths of the shock front occurring during the cyclic pulsation as discussed by onaka and coworkers .",
    "lebzelter et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the near - ir velocity amplitude increases along the agb of 47 tuc .",
    "thus a relation between pulsational properties and the dust composition can be expected .",
    "the necessity of taking into account pulsation characteristics as an additional factor beside luminosity is illustrated by comparing the spectra of v21 and v4 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the overall shape of the mid - infrared spectrum ",
    "but not the dust features that occur  seems additionally to depend on the pulsational phase .",
    "a more complete discussion of the individual dust spectra will be given in a forthcoming paper , where we will give a more detailed presentation of the spectra and a comparison with combined atmospheric and dust models .",
