    "the higgs sector is a crucial building block of the standard model of particle physics and parameterizes the masses of matter fields and weak gauge bosons .",
    "this successful parameterization goes along with two problems of the standard model which give rise to the belief that the standard model should be embedded in a larger fundamental framework : the hierarchy problem and the triviality problem .",
    "these problems have initiated many further developments .",
    "the triviality problem renders the theory ill - defined from a fundamental point of view , since it inhibits an extension of the standard model to arbitrarily high momentum scales @xcite .",
    "the scale of the maximum ultra - violet ( uv ) extension @xmath3 induced by triviality is expected to be related to the landau pole of perturbation theory .",
    "of course , the landau pole , i.e. , the divergence of a perturbative running coupling at a finite uv scale , in the first place signals the breakdown of perturbation theory . near the landau pole , nonperturbative physics can set in and severely modify the picture .",
    "so , a study of the triviality problem and the existence of a finite @xmath3 therefore requires a nonperturbative tool .",
    "this has also inspired a number of lattice investigations of scalar and chiral yukawa systems @xcite .    whereas the triviality problem is a true conceptual problem of the standard model , the hierarchy problem , i.e.",
    ", the possible existence of a huge difference between the electroweak scale and an underlying fundamental scale such as the gut or the planck scale , is only a problem of unnaturally fine - tuned initial conditions ( in this case of the mass parameter in the higgs potential at the underlying scale ) .",
    "solutions to these two problems are often sought by introducing field theories with new degrees of freedom or higher symmetries or by going beyond quantum field theory .",
    "the guiding principle of this work is more conservative , as we intend to identify ( or rule out ) possible solutions within quantum field theory essentially using the same or very similar degrees of freedom of the standard model .",
    "quantum field theory indeed offers a framework for such solutions in terms of weinberg s asymptotic safety scenario @xcite , which has already been investigated in a variety of models ranging from four - fermion models @xcite , simple yukawa systems @xcite , nonlinear sigma models in @xmath4 @xcite , and extra - dimensional gauge theories @xcite to gravity @xcite . for the asymptotic - safety scenario to apply , a fixed point of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow in the space of couplings has to exist .",
    "if the system sits on an rg trajectory that hits the fixed point in the uv , the uv cutoff can safely be taken to infinity , and the theory can remain valid to arbitrarily short distance scales .",
    "in fact , a suitable fixed point has recently been identified in a z@xmath5-symmetric yukawa system @xcite , serving as a simple toy model for the top - higgs sector of the standard model . moreover ,",
    "a generic mechanism inducing such a fixed point has been proposed which relies on a conformal behavior of the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "this conformal - vev mechanism is generated by a dynamical self - balancing of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom in the uv . in the simple z@xmath6 model ,",
    "this balancing actually occurs only for small fractional flavor number @xmath7 .",
    "this observation is a strong motivation to consider more realistic yukawa systems and to explore the potential of the conformal - vev mechanism for the uv problems of the standard model .",
    "another scenario to circumvent the problem of triviality in such a z@xmath5-symmetric yukawa system in the same framework occurs by coupling the system to a gravitational background @xcite .",
    "this work is devoted to an investigation of a chiral @xmath8 yukawa model , serving as a more sophisticated toy - model for the higgs sector of the standard model ( or of a gut - like theory ) .",
    "the model is designed to have a left - handed chiral sector as is typical for the higgs sector of the standard model .",
    "the number of left - handed fermions @xmath9 is left as a free parameter in order to study the dependence of a potential fixed point on the varying numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "as will be demonstrated by our analysis , this chiral structure facilitates a more boson - dominated higgs vacuum expectation value which is a prerequisite for conformal - vev mechanism to work . using the functional rg as a nonperturbative approach ,",
    "we systematically search for the existence of non - gauian interacting fixed points of the rg flow which could allow for an extension of the model to arbitrarily high momentum scales and render the system asymptotically safe .",
    "a particularly attractive by - product of an asymptotically safe higgs sector is given by the fact that the number of physical parameters is dictated by the number of rg - relevant directions at the fixed point and is thus an inherent property of the model . as this number can actually be smaller than the corresponding one at the gauian fixed point ( defining the `` perturbative '' standard model ) , asymptotic safety can lead to a reduction of physical parameters and hence have more predictive power .",
    "for instance , the interacting fixed point in the z@xmath5-invariant toy model has one relevant direction less than the perturbative fixed point . as an immediate consequence ,",
    "the value of the higgs mass becomes a prediction once the higgs vev and the top mass are fixed . for a fixed point of our chiral model discussed in this work ,",
    "even the top mass can become a prediction , demonstrating the predictive and constraining power of the asymptotic safety scenario .",
    "a crucial question for all nonperturbative techniques is the systematic consistency and reliability of the results . in this work ,",
    "we compute the rg flow of the model in a systematic derivative expansion of the effective action .",
    "this expansion is controlled if the momentum dependence of full effective vertices takes only little influence on the flow .",
    "a direct means for measuring this influence is the size of the anomalous dimensions @xmath10 of the fields , since next - to - leading order contributions couple to the leading - order derivative expansion only via terms @xmath11 .",
    "monitoring the size of @xmath10 thus gives us a direct estimate of the reliability of our results . whereas the anomalous dimensions at the fixed point of the z@xmath5 model were indeed found to be small",
    ", the anomalous dimensions at the fixed point of the present model can become large .",
    "hence , the results within the present model have to be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "the reason for the difference between the two models lies in the existence of goldstone bosons as well as massless fermions in the present model which contribute dominantly to the anomalous dimensions .",
    "as these massless modes are not present in the standard model , we expect that the leading - order derivative expansion ( where @xmath12 ) of the present system can serve as a model for the higgs - yukawa sector of a more realistic gauged version . from this viewpoint ,",

    "our central idea is that the contributions with opposite sign from bosonic and fermionic fluctuations to the vev can be balanced such that the vev exhibits a conformal behavior , @xmath15 . here , @xmath16 is the scale at which we consider the couplings of the system .",
    "the dimensionless squared vev @xmath17 has a flow equation of the form @xmath18 if the interaction terms are absent , the gauian fixed point @xmath19 is the only conformal point , corresponding to a free massless theory .",
    "if the interaction terms are nonzero , e.g. , if the couplings approach interacting fixed points by themselves , the sign of these terms decides about a possible conformal behavior . a positive contribution from the interaction terms gives rise to a fixed point at @xmath20 which can control the conformal running over many scales .",
    "if they are negative , no physically acceptable conformal vev is possible .",
    "since fermions and bosons contribute with opposite signs to the interaction terms , the existence of a fixed point @xmath21 crucially depends on the relative strength between bosonic and fermionic fluctuations .",

    "already at this qualitative level of the discussion , it is worthwhile to stress that the standard model has such a left - right asymmetric structure which can support the conformal - vev fixed point .      in the asymptotic - safety scenario of a quantum field theory ,",

    ", the present construction corresponds to the standard perturbative power - counting analysis and the critical exponents are equal to the power counting dimensions of the couplings .",
    "if a critical exponent is much larger than zero , say of @xmath59 , the rg trajectory rapidly leaves the fixed - point regime towards the ir .",
    "therefore , separating a typical uv scale where the system is close to the fixed point from the ir scales where , e.g. , physical masses are generated requires a significant fine - tuning of the initial conditions .",

    "these three parameters can be specified , e.g. , in terms of the bare yukawa coupling @xmath149 , the @xmath119 coupling @xmath150 , and the scalar mass term in units of the uv cutoff @xmath151 .. ]    the bare parameters can be fixed in terms of renormalization conditions .",
    "the latter ultimately relates these parameters to the physical ir parameters : the higgs vev @xmath13 , the higgs mass @xmath152 and the top mass @xmath153 .",
    "these , in turn , are related to the renormalized couplings @xmath154 by @xmath155 ( the bottom - type quarks remain massless in our model . )         this counting of independent physical parameters changes drastically if the system originates from the non - gauian fixed point in the limit of an infinite uv cutoff .",
    "as the non - gauian fixed point has only one relevant direction , there is only one physical parameter which we relate to the vev @xmath156gev .",
    "in fact , fixing @xmath13 to its physical value merely corresponds to fixing the absolute scale .",
    "dimensionless couplings or mass ratios are even independent of this fixing scale and thus are completely parameter - free predictions of the theory .    in practice",

    "this also fixes the value of @xmath157 in units of , say , gev . in the model with @xmath158",
    ", we then end up with a top and a higgs mass at the ir scale @xmath159 where the proportionality factors are approached in the limit @xmath160 . in this limit , this result is robust as we vary the uv cutoff , which demonstrates the cutoff independence of our prediction . as a result ,",

    "whereas the higgs mass is of the order of the vev as expected , @xmath161gev for @xmath156gev , the top mass is significantly larger in our model : @xmath162gev .",
    "this is an indirect consequence of the comparatively large value of the fixed point of the yukawa coupling . in order to elucidate this relation ,",
    "let us note that the flow can be subdivided into three different regimes : first , the uv fixed - point regime where all couplings stay close to their fixed point values ; second , a crossover region where all couplings run fast ; and third , a freeze - out region in the ir where the dimensionful vev builds up and induces decoupling and a subsequent approach to the generically frozen ir values .",
    "the dynamics in the crossover region is an intrinsic parameter - free property of the model that occurs only in a rather narrow window of momentum scales .",
    "hence , the couplings have only a finite `` rg time ''  similar to the number of @xmath163-foldings in inflationary cosmology  to run from their uv initial conditions to their ir - frozen values .",
    "as the initial fixed - point yukawa coupling in our model is large , a sizeable ir value remains and gives rise to a large top mass .",
    "the same mechanism has been identified in the z@xmath5-symmetric yukawa system in @xcite even for the case with two relevant directions . there , the top mass is , in principle , a physical parameter to be fixed ; still , the finite number of crossover @xmath163-foldings leads to a lower bound on the higgs mass .",
    "realistic scenarios with a physical value of the top mass require either a smaller fixed - point yukawa coupling , or a sufficiently large number of crossover @xmath163-foldings that facilitates a long running of the yukawa coupling to its physical value . as the number of @xmath163-foldings of the crossover window is mainly dictated by the rg speed at which the physical vev builds up",
    ", large numbers of @xmath163-foldings can occur if the largest critical exponent dominating the @xmath22 flow is small .",
    "we conclude that a reduced hierarchy problem and a realistic value of the top mass can go hand in hand with each other .",
    "finally , we have to address an artifact of our flow in the ir . as can be read off from fig .",
    "[ fig : ssbflow ] , the perturbatively marginal couplings @xmath111 and @xmath164 still exhibit a slow log - like running in the ir . in our present set of flow equations ,",
    "the source of this running can be traced back to the goldstone modes which are a particularity of our model , but are not present in the standard model . however , even if we considered the goldstone modes as physical , the log - like running is still an artifact of our truncation in the ir .",
    "this artifact arises from the cartesian decomposition of the scalar field , @xmath165 ( we suppress flavor indices in the following argument ) where the vev is associated with the @xmath166 direction and @xmath167 is populated with goldstone modes .",
    "this decomposition leads to log - like divergencies in the diagrams with internal @xmath167 loops coupling to external @xmath166 legs .",
    "however , as becomes clear from a proper nonlinear decomposition of the scalar field @xmath168 , the true goldstone modes encoded in the field @xmath169 do not couple to the radial mode via the potential , as @xmath170 is independent of @xmath169 .",
    "we conclude that the log - like running would be absent in a proper nonlinear field basis in the broken regime @xcite .    in practice , we read off our estimates for the ir values of @xmath111 and @xmath164 at a dynamically defined scale @xmath171 . for the identification of this scale",

    "the results as a function of @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ssbanom ] . whereas the criterion is satisfied for @xmath178 and @xmath179 for @xmath180 , the anomalous dimension @xmath181 of the right - handed fermion violates the criterion for all @xmath9 .",
    "the violation is dramatic for the fixed point with two relevant directions and still substantial for the fixed point with one relevant direction .",
    "one reason for the size of @xmath181 lies in the fact that the massless goldstone modes and massless bottom - type fermions contribute strongly .",
    "this is because they ( i ) are not damped by massive threshold effects induced by couplings to the condensate , and ( ii ) contribute with a large multiplicity @xmath182 .",
    "we conclude that the leading - order derivative expansion does not provide for self - consistent estimates of the fixed - point structure of the chiral yukawa model as such .",
    "nevertheless , since the goldstone as well as the massless fermion modes are not present in the standard model but a particularity of our reduced toy model , we expect that the local - potential approximation of the present model provides for a better picture of a possible fixed - point structure of the standard - model higgs sector than the literal version of our model including its massless modes .",
    "it is still an interesting question within the chiral yukawa model , whether the nonlinearities induced by the anomalous dimension gives rise to admissible fixed points if the full rg improvement is taken into account . for this , we have first followed the evolution of our leading - order fixed points upon gradually switching on the anomalous dimensions .",
    "our numerical results are compatible with a destabilization of this fixed point , potentially going along with an annihilation with other fixed points .",
    "a numerical search of further admissible fixed points upon the full inclusion of the anomalous dimension remained inconclusive .",
    "owing to the high degree of nonlinearity of the coupled equations , a systematic search in this high - dimensional parameter space is computationally expensive and beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we have explored a new possible route to asymptotically safe yukawa systems with a chiral u@xmath0u@xmath1 symmetry , similar to the higgs - top sector of the standard model .",
    "this work is motivated by the fact that an asymptotically safe yukawa sector can solve the triviality problem of the standard - model higgs sector and potentially improve on the hierarchy problem , both of which represent genuine problems related to the uv stability and completion of standard - model particle physics . in our scenario proposed in @xcite , asymptotic safety is based on a conformal higgs expectation value that induces a non - gauian uv fixed point for all essential couplings .",
    "this conformal behavior can arise from the dynamics of the theory as a consequence of a balancing between fermionic and bosonic fluctuation contributions to the running of the vev . more specifically , since bosonic fluctuations need to dominate , the existence of this conformal - vev behavior depends on the algebraic structure of the theory .",
    "it is a central result of our work that chiral models with an asymmetry between left- and right - handed fermions in fact support this boson dominance .",
    "our quantitative investigations are based on the functional rg , using the derivative expansion as a nonperturbative approximation scheme for a systematic calculation of the quantum effective action . to leading - order ( local - potential approximation ) ,",
    "our left - right asymmetric model exhibits the desired non - gauian fixed points for @xmath183 . whereas a physically admissible non - gauian fixed point establishes the existence of the yukawa model as a fundamental uv complete quantum field theory , the physical properties of such a uv completion are quantified by the non - negative critical exponents of this fixed point .",
    "their number corresponds to the number of physical parameters , and their value is a measure of the naturalness of a large hierarchy ( between , say , the planck and the electroweak scale ) .",
    "most importantly , one of the admissible fixed points has only one positive critical exponent .",
    "this implies that only one physical parameter has to be fixed , e.g. , the vev @xmath156gev , whereas all other ir quantities such as the higgs or the top mass are a pure prediction of the theory .",
    "moreover , this critical exponent is also smaller than the corresponding value in the perturbative domain , such that the hierarchy behavior is substantially improved .",
    "unfortunately , the fixed point in our toy model is destabilized at higher order in the derivative expansion due to massless goldstone and fermion fluctuations .",
    "as the latter are a particularity of our model and are not present in the standard model , we expect the results from the local - potential approximation to be of high relevance for a more realistic model of the standard - model higgs sector .",
    "on the other hand , our results have proved robust under an extension of the approximation scheme in the boson effective potential .    as a main result of the present study , a number of conclusions about the requirements for a more realistic model can be drawn .",
    "the appearance of the conformal - vev mechanism depends crucially on the algebraic structure of the theory .",
    "boson dominance is required and can be induced by a chiral left - right asymmetry .",
    "if the conformal vev breaks a continuous global symmetry , goldstone bosons are generated .",
    "as they are not controlled by threshold effects , they may have the tendency to destabilize the uv fixed point . a model with spontaneous breaking of gauged symmetries",
    "will not be affected by this problem .",
    "( 3 . ) even though the threshold effects of the conformal vev are nonperturbative , our mechanism does technically not require strong coupling .",
    "comparatively small uv fixed - point couplings would also be allowed if not phenomenologically preferred .",
    "the present model predicts a very large top mass . for a realistic top mass , either the yukawa uv fixed - point value should not be too large or the crossover from the uv regime to the ir freeze - out should extend over many `` @xmath163-foldings '' , i.e. , a larger range of rg time .",

    "<S> we search for asymptotic safety in a yukawa system with a chiral u@xmath0u@xmath1 symmetry , serving as a toy model for the standard - model higgs sector . using the functional rg as a nonperturbative tool , the leading - order derivative expansion exhibits admissible non - gauian fixed - points for @xmath2 which arise from a conformal threshold behavior induced by self - balanced boson - fermion fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> if present in the full theory , the fixed - point would solve the triviality problem . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as one fixed point has only one relevant direction even with a reduced hierarchy problem , the higgs mass as well as the top mass are a prediction of the theory in terms of the higgs vacuum expectation value . in our toy model , the fixed point is destabilized at higher order due to massless goldstone and fermion fluctuations , which are particular to our model and have no analogue in the standard model . </S>"
