    "the ability to control current in molecular junctions is a prerequisite for functional devices in molecular electronics .",
    "of particular interest for nanoelectronics are two - terminal switches characterized by two distinct current - voltage characteristics ( ivc ) representing on- and off - states , switchable by exceeding threshold voltages in hysteretic junctions . with such two - terminal components one can in principle build nanoscale memory and resistor - diode logic for scalable architectures @xcite .",
    "a major challenge is to develop two - terminal unimolecular switches ( ums ) where the switching is truly intramolecular , and not due to cooperative or interface effects in multi - molecule junctions .",
    "one ums example is provided by a recent experiment by lrtscher _",
    "_ , using a mechanically controlled break junction ( mcbj ) to demonstrate switching and hysteretic current - voltage characteristics ( ivc ) of a single tour - wire molecule @xcite .",
    "an ums should be electrically coupled and immobilized in the circuit , yet have enough freedom to perform switching . up to now",
    ", several different kinds of molecular switches have been proposed , most of them involving a change of molecular conformation @xcite , or redox state @xcite . an interesting case related to",
    "the present discussion is an snpc switch @xcite where the current is determined by the vertical position of the tin atom , controlled by a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "recently , liljeroth _",
    "@xcite proposed a new type of molecular switch where the switching is mediated by a tautomerization reaction of metal - free naphthalocyanine . using a low - temperature stm ,",
    "a voltage pulse at the stm tip can induce a change in the orientation of the hydrogen atom - pair at the center of naphthalocyanine , leading to switching between low and high conductance .",
    "the fact that naphthalocyanine does not change position or conformation of the molecular framework could be very beneficial for controlling molecular electronic circuits .",
    "if the molecule can be integrated in the circuit , it will not move or change its outer shape upon switching .",
    "there is now a variety of techniques that can be used for contacting and investigating single molecules ( see e.g. refs .",
    ". however , when it comes to interconnecting single molecules to functional electronic circuits , there are currently no working solutions .",
    "the circuits will necessarily have to be based on various forms of self - assembly of building blocks @xcite , but the field is wide open , and extensive fundamental research will be needed before useful functional systems can emerge .",
    "one possibility to wire circuits could be to first deposit the molecules and then grow the wires .",
    "this case has recently been investigated by okawa _",
    "@xcite , with the pronounced goal to fabricate a single - molecule integrated circuit .",
    "nano - clusters of phthalocyanine molecules are adsorbed on a molecular layer of diacetylene , and chain polymerization is initiated by applying a pulsed bias voltage to the row of diacetylene molecules to which a phthalocyanine pentamer is adsorbed . in this way",
    "_ @xcite recently succeeded in connecting two polydiacetylene chains to the same pentamer phthalocyanine molecule .    in this paper , we focus on the planar electrical transport properties of a ums based on hydrogen tautomerization in metal - free phthalocyanine ( h@xmath0pc ) connected to semi - infinite metallic wires of carbon ( cumulene ) @xcite or gold .",
    "the transport properties are examined as a function of the electronic structure of the tautomer state of the molecule , the type of leads , and the coupling between electrodes and the molecule .",
    "our results show that switching the orientation of the h - h atom pair in the h@xmath0pc cavity can significantly change the conductance of the molecule , effectively leading to on- and off - states for both cumulene ( fig .",
    "[ ivc_cumulene ] ) and gold ( fig .",
    "[ ivc_au ] ) leads .",
    "moreover , in the case of gold we find that negative differential resistance ( ndr ) appears at high bias voltages due to reduced transmission through one of the contacts .",
    "a few important clear limitations should be noted from the start : we treat neither ( i ) the influence of any substrate nor ( ii ) the switching mechanism and stability ( usefulness ) of the switch .",
    "_ @xcite have demonstrated experimentally that the switch works in principle in vertical transport ( stm ) with the molecule lying flat on an insulating monolayer on top of a metallic substrate . in our work",
    "we instead probe theoretically the horizontal ( planar ) transport properties of a `` freestanding '' 2d system of a h@xmath0pc molecule plus leads . connecting molecular devices in the 2d plane will be essential for building functional circuits - here we present some first results for planar transport of some simple model systems in order to assess their potential usefulness as switches or non - linear elements .",
    "the mechanism of bias - driven tautomerization has recently been attributed to electron - phonon coupling@xcite , implying that the switching can most probably be triggered by either an stm - like current pulse into the molecular plane , or a current pulse along the h@xmath0pc plane .",
    "the results of liljeroth _",
    "@xcite showed the stm - driven molecule to be bistable , however fluctuating ( telegraph type of noise ) between the two conductance levels with time ( and especially under elevated bias ) .",
    "we would like to point out that the interaction of the h@xmath0pc with the underlying substrate stabilizes the off and on states by increasing the transition barrier .",
    "in the related bistable case of ag - c@xmath1-ag @xcite , the hysteretic behaviour was more stable , except at high bias where fluctuating switching dominated .",
    "as stated at the beginning , a switch has two properties : ( i ) an ivc with two branches , on and off ; and ( ii ) a mechanism for switching between those two branches .",
    "the off state can typically be generated by ( a ) interrupting a single conduction path by disrupting wave function overlap ; or ( b ) by interference of two conduction paths , placing an interference minimum at the fermi level .    in the present calculation ,",
    "the difference between the on and off states is produced by a two - channel interference effect , involving nearly degenerate homo and homo-1 orbitals and controlled by the h - h tautomer switch . in a molecular context",
    ", similar interference effects were discussed early on by sautet and joachim @xcite for transmission through benzene described as two - path interferometer , and has recently been elaborated for benzene and other systems in several papers using state of the art methods @xcite . in all of these cases ,",
    "the basic idea is to influence the interference by varying the phase shift along one of the paths , controlling the transmission at the fermi level and implementing a transistor or switch .    in the present paper",
    "we study the case where the two interfering states remain pinned at the edge of the bias window .",
    "therefore the entire ivc is controlled by interference : the zero - bias destructive interference minimum in the off - state stays within the voltage window , following the fermi level of one of the leads , while the transmission peaks stay outside . in the absence of the other transmission peaks",
    "( conducting states ) in the voltage window this makes it possible , in principle , to follow e.g. the off - state with increasing bias until the molecule switches to the on - state , generating a hysteretic ivc @xcite .",
    "other methods for switching would be via current pulses @xcite or photoexcitation @xcite .",
    "to model the h@xmath0pc junctions , in principle the external leads are coupled directly to the outer rim of the h@xmath0pc molecule .",
    "however , the computational method requires that part of the leads are treated as an extension of the molecule , forming an extended molecule and scattering region coupled to semi - infinite leads . for coupling",

    "the homo of the off - state ( a ) is weakly coupled to left and right leads and gives rise to a narrow transmission peak close to the fermi level ( _ _ e__=0 ) , while the homo-1 ( b ) is strongly coupled to the leads , resulting in a broad transmission peak _ well below _ the fermi level ( fig .",
    "[ tev_cumulene]b ) .    turning the h - h pair knob to the on - state reverses the orbital character of the homo and homo-1 levels and changes the orbital character at the fermi level .",

    "[ tev_cumulene ] explains the basic reason for the large on / off conductance ratio in the 0 - 1 v bias range : the off - state transmission resonance stays almost entirely below the fermi level of the lead for which chemical potential @xmath10 = _ _ e__@xmath11-_ev_/2 goes down under applied bias , while the on - state resonance extends into the bias voltage window .",
    "apart from this , the transmission spectra are rather similar .    since the transmission near the fermi level proceeds via two channels ( orbitals ) , one can expect interference effects to affect line shapes and widths of the spectral peaks .",

[ tev_au ] . the reason is reduced coupling between the au - leads . since the main conduction peaks follow the chemical potential of the left lead with upgoing potential , that part of the h@xmath0pc molecule should be well connected to the left lead . it is then reasonable to conclude ( and supported by transmission eigenchannel analysis ) , that the coupling to the right lead is reduced .",
    "negative differential resistance is of great interest because ndr elements can be used for building bi - stable devices and highly functional components like latches , oscillators , memories @xcite and logic xor gates @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "ndr has been at the focus of a number of recent experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite papers .    the ndr effect found by quek _",
    "@xcite is explained in terms of gold electrodes supporting molecule - electrode contact driven ndr , where the coupling to the rather narrow bands of 1d au chains stretched on the surface plays an important role .",
    "this looks similar to our case at high bias .",
    "the ndr effect investigated by riberio _",
    "@xcite deals with quantum transport properties of porphyrin - bridged p - n junctions with si leads , and the ndr effect is controlled by the doping levels of the leads and the central transition metal atom of the porphyrin .",
    "the results are explained in terms of bias - induced on - off switching of resonant tunneling channels associated with specific molecular orbitals .",
    "this ndr can then be regarded as arising from bias - driven reduced molecule - lead overlap .",
    "this again looks similar to our case at high bias .",
    "finally , the ndr effect studied by pati _",
    "@xcite is explained in terms of reduced overlap between conduction links through the molecule itself .",
    "this is in contrast to our case where the reduced overlap appears at a contact to the molecule , the transmission peaks basically following one lead or the other . in the case of ref .",
    ", the peaks do not move with bias , suggesting that the voltage drop over the molecule is distributed in a balanced way over and around the molecule .    from an ivc point of view",
    "there is no big difference between these cases .",
    "the differences are primarily visible in the @xmath9 spectrum and reflect the details of the bias - dependence of the bias - voltage drop over the junctions , manifested in strongly non - linear ivcs . with more experience it might be possible to relate different types of ndr - features to different types of weak - link distributions and instabilities .",
    "it seems likely that voltage- or current- driven excitations and instabilities should be sensitive to the distribution of strong fields ( potential drops ) over contacts or inside molecules .    also note in fig .",
    "[ ivc_au ] the appearance of weak ndr around 0.7 v bias in au(001)-au@xmath0-h@xmath4pc - au@xmath0-au(001 ) , and very weak ndr around 0.9 v bias in au(001)-au@xmath21-h@xmath4pc - au@xmath21-au(001 ) .",
    "the latter case can in principle be understood from fig .",
    "[ tev_au]a : the ndr ( or plateau ) seems to be connected with lineshape variation of the homo / homo-1 transmission peak structure .",
    "the fano lineshapes suggest that interference effects again may play a role .",
    "we have shown that the two tautomer configurations of phtalocyanine ( h@xmath0pc ) connected to conducting leads form junctions with widely different conductances , especially at low bias . with",
    "the h - h pair rotated ( hydrogen tautomerization performed ) by external means , the junction presents a single - molecular switch .",
    "this fact , together with the experimental demonstration of liljeroth _",
    "_ @xcite that the switch works in principle in stm configuration ( for vertical transport ) , makes h@xmath0pc an interesting candidate for a unimolecular electronic switch .",
    "we find that hydrogen tautomerization affects the electronic state of h@xmath4pc by switching the order of the molecular orbital energies between homo and homo-1 , causing a large change in the current .",
    "we specifically reveal the influence of molecular charging and molecule - electrode coupling on the transport mechanism .",
    "in particular , we show that the applied bias potential drop can shift from one metal - molecule contact to the other at intermediate bias , leading to pronounced features in the ivc .",
    "we also find that a two - channel interference effect is clearly manifested in pronounced fano shapes characterizing the transmission peaks close to the fermi level .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that the underlying reason for the on / off ivcs in the studied configurations is the presence of two interacting , interfering , conduction channels around the fermi level , being controlled by the tautomer switch .",
    "this interference effect is dramatic in the sense that it leads to a large on / off ratio over a wide bias voltage range .    two final comments on the interference effect : ( 1 ) since we expect the substrate to play a pronounced role stabilizing the two states of the molecule , the question arises how this will influence the interference , which is at the heart of the junction transport .",
    "since the two nearly degenerate tautomer states have similar spacial localization , we expect the interaction with the substrate not to significantly change the level splitting .",
    "the levels could be shifted relative to the fermi level , changing the conductivity , but that is not really the issue here : the on / off switching contrast should remain .",
    "( 2 ) the calculation is done for frozen geometry , taking into account redistribution of electronic density on the molecule .",
    "the shift of the bias voltage drop in fig . 7 in the range 1 - 1.4v",
    "is connected with the steep increase of conductivity in fig .",
    "major electronic density redistribution can be expected to lead to conformational changes , and the large drop of the conductivity ( ndr ) in the1.4 - 1.6v range in fig .",
    "2 certainly needs to be investigated taking into account effects of atomic relaxation .",
    "but , then again , a free - molecule calculation may not be relevant : the atomic relaxation will be constrained by the stabilizing effect of the environment / substrate . for this reason , we expect the calculated ndr effect in au - h2pc - au in fig . 2 to be relevant for the molecule lying flat on a substrate .",
    "we also conclude , that the d@xmath35 molecular symmetry of the h@xmath0pc with the homo and homo-1 occupying opposite ` arms ' with / without hydrogens is an essential component in creating the potential profile across the junction .",
    "it is important to use this symmetry in order to obtain different conductances for different h@xmath0pc configurations .",
    "the connection to the electrodes must not be to neighbouring arms ( in which case the h - h pair rotation only flips the mirror symmetry of the junction ) : connecting neigboring arms produces an ivc that is the average of the on- and off - states , losing the switching effect .",
    "coupling to the electrodes should also respect the symmetry by introducing minimal distortion . in our study h@xmath0pc",
    "is physisorbed at the gold electrodes ; our attempts to chemisorb h@xmath0pc on gold via two thiol groups directly connected to the molecule only resulted in locking of the homo and homo-1 relative positions , thus preventing the switching .",
    "however , we exemplify with cumulene electrodes that it is possible to design linkers in the form of molecular ligands to interconnect h@xmath0pc to external leads .",
    "we demonstrate , by considering different electrode types , that the conduction of the junction is significantly affected by the choice of contacts .",
    "both cumulene @xcite and gold leads are highly conductive , however matching of the gold s - states to the h@xmath0pc conjugated @xmath36-orbital introduces additional backscattering , yielding  4 times less current at comparable voltages .",
    "in addition , the ivcs of junctions with gold leads exhibit pronounced negative differential resistance ( ndr ) at high bias voltage , as well as examples of weak ndr at intermediate bias .",
    "this , together with switching , makes h@xmath0pc an interesting candidate for a multifunctional molecular component @xcite .",
    "we realize , that the modelled system with the two closely spaced gold contacts is difficult to create in experiment .",
    "nevertheless we believe that this difficulty is an additional good reason for preliminary theoretical assessment of the setup .",
    "our investigation of h@xmath0pc is inspired by the need for switches and non - linear elements in molecular electronic circuits .",
    "however , the goal of this work has been strictly limited to investigating the transmission properties of the two tautomer states .",
    "we have not investigated the switching mechanism or stability of the off and on states , or the influence of different substrates .",
    "it remains to investigate how the current through the junction may switch between off and on states at elevated bias , including hysteretic behavior due to relaxation , current - driven fluctuations and thermal noise , as well as the influence of substrate surfaces on the conduction mechanisms .",
