    "produces distant sidelobes far from the main beam , which are particularly important in contaminating 21 cm line profiles with `` stray radiation '' . for example , when observing a weak high - latitude position with a sidelobe lying on the galactic plane , the profile can be heavily contaminated .",
    "the nature of the contamination depends both on hour angle , because the distant sidelobes might hit the ground instead of the sky , and on the observing epoch , because of doppler shifts from the earth s orbital motion .",
    "a great advance in 21 cm line survey data occurred when @xcite corrected both northern and southern sky 21 cm line survey data for stray radiation ; the resulting `` lab '' ( leiden / argentine / bonn ) survey is largely free of stray radiation .    with its absence of aperture blockage",
    ", one would expect the gbt to have very low stray radiation .",
    "however , this is not the case , as first shown by @xcite . we have used the gbt to measure zeeman splitting of the 21 cm line , which requires long integrations . for four circumpolar positions we have nearly full 24-hour coverage .",
    "we observe systematic time variations during the observing periods , both in stokes @xmath2 and stokes @xmath1 .",
    "these are reminiscent of stray radiation .",
    "the present paper explores these effects for both stokes @xmath2 and @xmath1 observations , and for stokes @xmath2 presents an approximate correction scheme to remove these contaminants .",

    "the term `` spillover '' refers to radiation transmitted from the feed toward the secondary reflector that would `` spill over '' its edge .",
    "clearly , the spillover is not simply what we would find from geometrical optics , which would have a sharp cutoff located at the reflector edge .",
    "rather , the profiles show diffraction effects , with the peak lying outside the occulting edge and a gradual decrease in intensity toward the inside of the occulting area , as predicted by physical optics @xcite",
    ". arrows on the left panel of figure [ sunscansi ] mark @xmath13 outside the reflector edge , roughly at the peak except for leg 0 .",
    "the decrease outside the peak is caused by the taper of the feed s illumination of the secondary .",
    "+ we represent this spillover pattern as being circularly symmetric about the axis of the subreflector center .",
    "however , careful inspection of figure [ sunscansi ] reveals that this symmetrical condition does not , in fact , obtain . comparing the peak locations with the arrows , which are located @xmath13 outside the subreflector edge",
    ", it is clear that the radial distance of the peaks of leg 0 is larger than the radial distances of the other peaks .",
    "a degree of noncircularity is expected because the secondary , as seen from the feed , is slightly elliptical ; see figure [ gbtsec ] . from this figure",
    ", we see that the secondary is slightly narrower in the az direction . because leg 0 samples the az direction more than the za direction , the narrower ellipse projection suggests that the peaks along leg 0 should lie _ closer _ , not further , than the other scans peaks , opposite to what we see .",
    "we attribute this apparent turnabout to structural components that lie behind the secondary and protrude out from its projected edge , which are apparent as the `` ears '' in figure [ gbtsec ] ; leg 0 passes close to these ears .",
    "_ the arago spot_. a striking feature on leg 2 is a small , intense spot , marked with a black spot .",
    "this is the famous arago spot of an occulting disk .",
    "according to @xcite , the intensity of the arago spot for incoming parallel plane waves should be equal to the peak intensity of radiation near the edge of the blockage .",
    "figure [ sunscansi ] shows that this condition is achieved quite closely .",
    "we measure the arago spot to be centered @xmath14 below the subreflector center ( i.e. , toward the primary beam ) ; this offset occurs because the axis of the secondary is tilted with respect to the line joining the feed and subreflector center .",
    "the screen component_. figure [ sunscansi ] shows that there is excess intensity near the main beam , which we call the `` screen '' component .",
    "careful examination of figure [ sunscansi ] shows that this excess tends to be asymmetric about the main beam center , with excess intensities tending toward negative za offsets .",
    "this is particularly apparent when comparing the lower half of leg 2 with those of legs 1 and 3 , and also with the nearby structure of leg 0 .",
    "it seems like a separate beam a few degrees in size that is offset from the main beam center by a few degrees .",
    "+ in our mind s eye , we attribute this to the reflecting `` screen , '' which controls the spillover radiation that hits the structural components of the feed arm . at the top of figure [ gbtsec ]",
    "we see these feed - arm structural components .",
    "this jumble of metal beams would uncontrollably scatter the spillover radiation . to control this component ,",
    "the telescope engineers installed a flat reflecting screen on the feed arm near the subreflector @xcite .",
    "this screen directs radiation coming from the feed back to the primary reflector , and then to cold sky .",
    "it is as if a separate source of radiation centered on the screen illuminates the primary reflector ; this source , the screen , is located near the intersection of leg 2 with the dashed circle at the top of figure [ gbtsec ] , at positive za offset with respect to the subreflector .",
    "being offset toward positive za offset , upon reflection from the primary reflector it would point toward negative za offset .",
    "we think that this might be responsible for the excess asymmetric intensity and this is why we call this the `` screen '' component .",
    "+ radiation that is removed from the spillover by the screen , which we discussed in the above paragraph , eliminates radiation from an angular slice of the spillover pattern .",

    "the other three sidelobe contributions have nonzero ( positive ) sky - integrated beam responses .",
    "however , the sky - integrated response of the nearin component is zero , because it is the difference between two main beam pointings . in particular ,",

    "we need to assign each observed spectrum its own gain and include the set of gains as unknowns in the fit .",
    "the overall intensity scale of the gbt spectra , relative to that of the lab spectra , changes from one position to another as shown in table [ intratio ] .",
    "the ratio of lab to gbt intensities ( lab / gbt ) ranges from 0.80 to 1.41 , changing by a factor of 1.75 , with smaller values associated with sources in the galactic plane and larger values associated with high - latitude positions .",

    "the line intensity has a relatively small fractional variation over the scale of 40 arcminutes , so the emission fills the main beams of both the gbt and the lab telescopes .",
    "in contrast , for the two high - latitude positions , the structure is filamentary with widths of order @xmath4610 arcmin , as shown by 100 @xmath47 m iras maps @xcite and , also , our currently unpublished gbt 21 cm maps of this area",
    ". the gbt main beam is filled , or nearly filled , by the emission ; but the larger beams of the lab telescopes are not filled  nor are their nearin diffraction lobes .",

    "+ we suspect that the suggested trend in table [ intratio ] for higher ratios at the high - latitude positions is an illusionary result of small - number statistics .",
    "we specifically do not believe that varying ratios of lab / gbt are produced by problems with the lab spectra , because great care has been taken to ensure their accuracy and , also , they have been carefully corrected for sidelobe problems .",

    "the observed spectrum is contaminated by contributions from the spillover , the arago spot , the screen , and the nearin response .",
    "the first three of these have nonzero ( positive ) sky - integrated beam responses , and the nearin one has zero integrated response .",
    "the following discussion applies only to the first three , not to the nearin component .",
    "+ in calculating the beams associated with these three contaminants , we normalize each one so that its gain - area product is unity ; we then simultaneously fit for the proper amplitude coefficients ( and other quantities ; see  [ lstech ] ) , which we call @xmath44 with appropriate subscripts . with the normalized integrated beam response , @xmath44 represents the contaminating beam s integrated `` beam efficiency .

    "that is , if the contaminating beam were placed in a blackbody cavity at temperature @xmath49 , it would contribute @xmath50 to the observed antenna temperature @xmath51 .",

    "in essence , this is forcing @xmath52 to equal unity .",
    "thus , for one of these first three contaminating beams , its value of @xmath44 represents its beam efficiency with respect to the main beam efficiency , i.e. , @xmath44 is equal to the contaminating beam s area - integrated response divided by that of the main beam . + this is a somewhat awkward situation , because the sum of the four @xmath44 values exceeds unity .",
    "that is , when the gbt is placed in a blackbody cavity of temperature @xmath49 , the antenna temperature exceeds @xmath49 by a factor equal to the sum of all four @xmath44 values .",

    "this awkwardness pervades measurements of extended sources by all single dishes , unless the sidelobes and main beam responses are reconciled as they are for the lab survey ( see @xcite and @xcite )",
    ". the proper reconciliation of these matters is a _ fundamentally important contribution _ by the lab survey .",

    "suppose we have a number of spectra @xmath55 , each with @xmath56 spectral channels , taken over a mostly complete range of 24 hours in lst .",
    "let the subscripts @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote the spectrum number and spectral channel number , respectively .",
    "let the superscript @xmath59 designate the observed value and @xmath60 the true value ( which is the same as the noise - free fitted value ) that would be observed in the absence of sidelobe contributions and gain errors .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the intensity , which is normally expressed in units of temperature . as we mentioned in  [ details ] , the intensity scaling of each spectrum ( the `` gain '' @xmath62 ) is not perfectly calibrated so we solve for the set of spectral gains . as we discussed in  [ details ] , we normalize each contaminating beam so that its gain - area product is unity ; then we fit for the proper scaling parameter , which we call @xmath44 with an appropriate subscript .",
    "the observed spectrum @xmath63 is equal to the true spectrum @xmath64 plus the contaminating contributions from the spillover , the arago spot , the screen , and the nearin .",
    "we calculate the contaminating spectral contribution of each of the first three by multiplying its beam by appropriately velocity - shifted spectra from the lab survey .",
    "we can use the lab survey for these beams because their angular scales are large compared to the lab s 36-arcmin angular resolution .",
    "however , the nearin contribution depends on the angular structure close to the gbt main beam , which is on a smaller scale than the lab survey resolution . for the nearin contribution",
    ", we estimate the angular derivatives of the emission brightness temperature from a 17-point sampling with the gbt centered on the position observed , using the same technique ( the `` z16 pattern '' : i.e. , 16 off - source positions and one on - source ) as @xcite .",
    "the following equation expresses the observed spectrum @xmath63 in terms of the true spectrum @xmath65 and the four contaminants @xmath66 , where the superscript @xmath67 runs from 0 to 3 and represents spillover , spot , screen , and nearin , respectively ; @xmath67 also applies to the beams @xmath44 coefficients as a subscript .",

    "there is one additional constraint we need to add as a final equation of condition .",
    "consider equation ( [ eqcond0 ] ) .",
    "the last term of this equation contains five temperature terms : the first , @xmath81 , and the other four , which are the sidelobe contributions @xmath82 .",
    "the first is much larger than the latter four .",
    "if we were to add a single constant to _ all _ @xmath83 , and simultaneously scale down @xmath81 , the fit would be almost unchanged .",
    "thus , there is a near - degeneracy between these quantities .",
    "if we allow this constant to exist , then there is a high negative covariance ( a near - degeneracy ) between the final values of ( 1 ) this constant value added to all @xmath72 and ( 2 ) the amplitude scaling of @xmath65 .",
    "we can remove this covariance  and retain the mean of the original amplitude scaling  by requiring the sum of the guessed gains to remain constant .",
    "this is equivalent to requiring @xmath84 it is straightforward to form a matrix ( the numerical recipes `` design matrix '' ; @xcite ) from the @xmath69 equations [ eqcond0 ] and the additional equation ( [ eqcond1 ] ) .",
    "we then perform the least - squares solution in the usual way .      in  [ lstech ] above we do not mention the unknown angle of the slice that is removed by the screen .",
    "nevertheless , we fit for it as an unknown parameter , in addition to the others mentioned above . instead of incorporating it into the equations of condition , however , we used the `` brute - force '' technique .",
    "that is , we selected a grid of values for the slice angle and carried through the least - squares fit of  [ lstech ] for each assumed value .",
    "then we plotted the variance versus the assumed slice angles .",
    "the minimum variance defines the fitted slice angle .",
    "the system gain is obtained by turning on a noise diode , which provides a calibrated broadband noise signal of known equivalent temperature .",
    "if this calibrated noise is constant and the system is linear , then this procedure reliably establishes the intensity scale for the measured 21 cm line profiles .",
    "the true intensity scale must be obtained by accounting for the atmospheric opacity , which we calculated using the procedure given by @xcite .",
    "although the opacity is small for the 21 cm line , about 0.013 at the zenith , it increases with the zenith angle and would appear as a time - variable gain as we track a source .",
    "we do , in fact , see time - variable gains  even after removing the atmospheric opacity .    in the following discussion ,",
    "the system gain @xmath85 is a normalized version of that in equation ( [ eqnf0 ] ) above : for each source we normalize all the gains so that their average is unity . with this , if the observed calibrated spectral intensities are too high by a factor of 1.2 , then the gain @xmath85 is equal to 1.2 .",
    "we also define the `` system temperature '' @xmath86 as the off - line system temperature for each spectrum . as above in  [ lsfits ] , the subscripts @xmath58 and @xmath57 represent spectral channel and spectrum number , respectively .",
    "we calculate these quantities using a least - squares fit , as follows .    for each source , we begin by averaging all the spectra to obtain the average spectrum @xmath87 . for each spectrum , we obtain the gain @xmath85 by comparing its 21 cm line intensity to that of @xmath88 , and we obtain the system temperature @xmath86 by comparing the off - line intensities .",
    "operationally , we obtain these parameters by a linear least - squares fit for each spectrum in which the independent variable is the average spectrum .",
    "that is , for each spectrum we fit for the zero intercept @xmath89 and the gain @xmath85 in the set of @xmath56 equations    @xmath90    ideally , all @xmath85 should be unity to within the uncertainties .",
    "unfortunately , this is not the case .",
    "the left - hand panels of figure [ allgains ] show the gains for five sets of observations versus elapsed time in days from the first observation ( in addition to the four sources above , we include 2003 january observations of the ncp ) .",
    "variations range up to @xmath010% displaying a systematic behavior with time .",
    "since these variations are not random , we have examined the systematic behavior and find no clear dependence that applies to all sources .",
    "however , there is a tendency for the gains to change in a somewhat common fashion with lst .",
    "the right - hand panels of figure [ allgains ] show the gains @xmath85 versus lst . for lsts below about 13 hours ,",
    "the gains tend to decrease with time ; above 13 hours , they tend to increase with time .    the data for the top two rows of panels , the ncp in 2003 january and the ncp in 2003",
    "september , are particularly intriguing .",
    "the telescope does nt move while tracking the ncp , so one can not attribute the changing gains to a changing telescope position .",
    "moreover , one can not attribute it to the influence of the sun , because the right ascension of the sun is 8 hours different for the two data sets .",
    "it seems that the changing gains must be produced internally to the receiver electronics ; the most straightforward explanation would be a changing noise diode temperature , but we are at a loss to propose an explanation of why it should change systematically with lst .",
    "of course , we have limited data , so perhaps the systematic change with lst is only an illusion .",
    "figure [ hilatgains ] shows that , for some sources , the system temperature @xmath86 varies systematically with the gain .",
    "the top panel ( ncp in 2003 january ) and the bottom two panels exhibit a very clear inverse correlation .",
    "in contrast , the ncp in 2003 september shows no visual dependence and g135.5@xmath3739.5 exhibits a small direct , instead of inverse , correlation",
    ". we can think of no reason why there should be any relation between system gain and temperature at the levels which seem so visually obvious in figure [ hilatgains ] .",
    "the important point for measurement of accurate 21 cm line profiles , however , is that the gains change substantially with time .",

    "examples include the @xmath120 bin for w3off , the @xmath121 bin for g139.1@xmath370.7 , and the @xmath122 bin for g135.5@xmath3739.5 . in most cases ,",
    "though , its correction represents only a small portion of the time - variable systematic errors in the stokes @xmath1 profiles .",
    "we conclude that the circularly - polarized portions of the four spillover contributions are responsible for most of the stokes @xmath1 inaccuracies .",
    "figures [ w30ffv][ncpv ] provide some clues about which components are serious contributors to these errors . we consider , first , the spillover and spot contributions .    1 .",
    "_ the spillover component_. generally , the stokes @xmath2 spillover profile covers a large velocity range . by inspection",
    ", this allows us to see that the stokes @xmath1 problems do not scale very well with the stokes @xmath2 spillover intensity .",
    "for example , the @xmath123 bin for w3off has severe stokes @xmath1 wiggles for @xmath124 km s@xmath10 , where the stokes @xmath2 spillover profile is weak ; more generally for this source , the stokes @xmath2 spillover profile changes quite a bit in intensity for @xmath124 km s@xmath10 , but the wiggle amplitudes in the stokes @xmath1 spectra do nt track these changes .",
    "the same general statement applies to g139.1@xmath370.7 .",
    "similarly , for the two high - latitude sources the stokes @xmath2 spillover amplitude varies considerably with pa , but the stokes @xmath1 wiggles do nt track these variations .",
    "the spot component_. generally , the stokes @xmath2 spot profile covers a smaller velocity range than the spillover profile and is less spectrally smooth .",
    "this makes it easier to see that the stokes @xmath1 problems are not well - correlated with the stokes @xmath2 spot profile intensity .",
    "clear examples include the @xmath125 bin for w3off , the @xmath126 bin for g139.1@xmath370.7 , and many of the bins for the two high - latitude sources .",
    "we conclude that most of the stokes @xmath1 wiggles do not come from the either the spillover or the spot lobe .    by the process of elimination , this leaves the screen and nearin components .",
    "consider , first , the possible contribution to stokes @xmath1 from the nearin component , i.e. , the diffraction rings .",
    "we concluded above in  [ diffraction ] that the integrated response of the diffraction rings is @xmath127 that of the main beam . in  [ vprimary ] we found that the diffraction rings are almost unmeasurable in stokes @xmath1 and are @xmath128 times weaker than the main - beam squint .",
    "we have seen that the main - beam squint accounts for only a fraction of the observed stokes @xmath1 wiggles .",
    "the contribution from the diffraction rings should be smaller .",
    "we conclude that the diffraction rings contribute insignificantly to the stokes @xmath1 wiggles .      again by process of elimination , we are left with the screen component as the culprit that produces the extraneous stokes @xmath1 wiggles .",
    "this conclusion makes quantitative sense .",
    "first , the integrated beam response of the screen component is roughly @xmath6 the main beam s (  [ details ] ; table [ lscoeffs ] ) .",
    "this seems small , but the stokes @xmath1 wiggles are of order @xmath129 the stokes @xmath2 amplitude , and the screen component is much more highly polarized than the main beam .",
    "above , in  [ vsecondary ] , we concluded its stokes @xmath1 fractional polarization reaches @xmath025% .",
    "moreover , this polarization changes over the size of the screen component , which is a ring of radius @xmath0@xmath38 ( eq .  [",
    "[ screeneqn ] ] ) .",
    "thus , it samples _ changes _ in the 21 cm profiles over much larger angles than the main beam does .",
    "unfortunately , our estimate of the screen beam is very rough .",
    "it is very difficult to accurately measure the screen component  not only in stokes @xmath2 , as we remarked above in  [ fitresults ] , but even more so in stokes @xmath1 .",
    "this means that we can not present any hard and fast rule about its effect .",
    "we can only offer a rule of thumb , which we base on comparing the stokes @xmath1 wiggle amplitude with the predicted stokes @xmath2 screen profile of figures [ w30ffv][ncpv ] . in these figures , the stokes @xmath1 wiggle is of order 0.2 times the predicted screen stokes @xmath2 profile .",
    "so we can offer the following :    1 .   for stokes @xmath1 measurements in narrow ranges of parallactic angle pa",
    ", results can be trusted if they are stronger than @xmath00.2 the predicted stokes @xmath2 screen component .",
    "averaging over larger ranges of parallactic angle pa helps greatly .",
    "if one has sampling of the full range of pa , then the stokes @xmath1 results are much more reliable .",
    "we sampled the gbt sidelobes and used structural and physical considerations to define four sidelobe components .",
    "three of these are related to the feed s illumination of the secondary reflector : the spillover , the spot , and the screen components (  [ sidelobeobsi ] ) .",
    "a fourth component , which we call the nearin component , is related to the diffraction rings (  [ diffraction ] ) .",
    "we applied a least - squares procedure (  [ lsfits ] ,  [ lsresults ] ) to full hour - angle coverage of 21 cm line data for four positions to obtain the amplitude of these components , and also to obtain the errors in calibrated gains for each spectrum and the true profile for each position .      1 .",
    "we find intrinsic differences between calibrated intensity for gbt versus lab profiles at the @xmath060% level ( table [ intratio ] ) , which we attribute to the higher main - beam efficiency of the gbt ; this , in turn , is a direct result of its clear , unblocked aperture .",
    "we find systematic time variations i n the calibrated gain ( figure [ allgains ] ) , which means that gbt 21 cm line profile intensities can not be relied on at the @xmath97 level .",
    "the combination of the spillover , spot , and screen sidelobes has an area - integrated beam response which is almost @xmath97 that of the main beam ( table [ lscoeffs ] ) .",
    "these can produce significant inaccuracy in observed stokes @xmath2 21 cm line profiles ( stray radiation ) .",
    "we use the solutions for the sidelobe beam responses , together with the lab survey , to predict and remove the 21 cm line contaminants with fair accuracy (  [ fitresults ] ) .",
    "the distant sidelobes also contribute to stokes @xmath1 21 cm line profiles (  [ stokesv ] ) .",
    "in particular , the screen component contributes a currently uncorrectable contaminant to the stokes @xmath1 profiles .",
    "this has amplitude @xmath020% of its stokes @xmath2 counterpart , so gbt stokes @xmath1 21 cm line profiles can not be trusted at this level unless they are averaged over significant ranges of parallactic angle .    in summary , 21 cm line profiles in both stokes @xmath2 and stokes @xmath1 contain significant contaminants . for stokes",
    "@xmath2 , these can be removed with some success with the procedure presented in this paper .",
    "uncertainties in the predicted contaminants are dominated by our inaccurate knowledge of the screen component .",
    "this can , in principle , be measured more accurately , but doing so requires high dynamic range measurements of an unresolved source ; these are probably feasible only using the interferometric technique of @xcite .",
    "we find it ironic that , historically , one of the arguments for the clear - aperture design of the gbt was the enhanced accuracy of 21 cm line profiles .",
    "the purity of its clear - aperture design is spoiled by the use of a cassegrain system , with its secondary reflector . upon reflection",
    ", we see that using the gbt in a prime - focus mode would retrieve most , perhaps all , of this purity .",
    "one would pay for this with a large beam squint in stokes @xmath1but this would be a predictably reliable and straightforward correction .",
    "it seems to us that using the gbt in prime - focus mode would provide more accurate 21 cm line profiles in both stokes @xmath2 and @xmath1 than performing a series of uncertain and perhaps time - variable corrections to profiles measured with the cassegrain system .",
