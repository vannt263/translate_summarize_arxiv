    "during the last decade new techniques in atom optics led to the possibility to produce atomic clouds and beams with very small velocity ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) . under such circumstances",
    "the influence of gravity has to be taken into account . to see in detail how gravity changes the atomic center - of - mass motion in the presence of laser fields ,",
    "atoms exposed simultaneously to a running laser wave and gravity were theoretically studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in many experiments gravity causes an unwanted change in the atomic momentum that must be accounted for in the design of an experiment ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "but there are several proposals and realizations in which gravity is used to slow or cool atoms .",
    "one example is the gravitational cavity @xcite in which freely falling atoms are reflected by an atomic mirror at the bottom of the cavity . here",
    "gravity is directly used to reverse the atomic upward motion .",
    "another example is the gravitational sisyphus cooling @xcite in which a magnetic field gradient used to cancel gravity produces a cooling force that is proportional to gravity .",
    "another proposal @xcite exploits the fact that the addition of the gravitational potential to a gradient force potential can result in new minima which may be used to form a trap .",
    "the gravitational cavity designed to trap atoms which is discussed in the references given above is based on the multiple bouncing of atoms on a reflective surface .",
    "it essentially contains two elements : a lower mirror for atoms provided by an evanescent laser wave and the influence of gravity which results in a second upper `` mirror '' closing the cavity because it bends the atomic trajectories . by this",
    "a `` trampoline '' geometry is obtained . in the following we want to present a setup in which the lower mirror closing the trap at the bottom is replaced by a combined influence of the gravitational field and the laser fields .",
    "gravitation as `` _ actio _ '' causes a free fall which together with the influence of the lasers leads to a `` _ reactio _ '' of the atoms turning them into an upward motion .",
    "a gravito - optically induced internal transition of the atoms is accompanied by a momentum transfer which causes an upward kick .",
    "afterwards , the free fall of the atoms continues until at a certain downward momentum resonance is obtained again , the next kick happens , and so on . in this way a sequence of up and down motions is obtained without any reflection at a surface .",
    "the result obtained could be called `` trampolining without trampoline '' .    in detail",
    "we study the free fall of a three - level @xmath0-system interacting with two laser fields and a magnetic field which is applied between the two lower levels , compare fig .",

    "we perform the rotating - wave - approximation and switch to the interaction picture . in section 3 the excited state",
    "is adiabatically eliminated .",
    "it turns out that in momentum space the dynamical equation separates into differential equations coupling ladders of states .",
    "it becomes evident that the fundamental gravito - optical transitions are of landau - zener type .",
    "the resulting center - of - mass motion of the atoms is read off in section 4 and a simple visualization of the underlying physics is given .",
    "a complete description of the process with reference to dressed states ( interaction energy of the magnetic field included ) is added in section 5 .",
    "we point out in section 6 that the setup represents a trap for atoms",
    ". if the initial state is a momentum state , drops fall out of the trap .",
    "if this assumption is not made , the trap is continuously leaking atoms .",
    "as seen from the inertial system the dynamical evolution of the three - level system in question is governed by the hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 describes the internal energy levels @xmath4 of the atom , @xmath5 is the center - of - mass part of the complete hamiltonian , and @xmath6 ( | e\\rangle\\langle + | \\ , + \\ ,      |+ \\rangle \\langle e| )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{1 cm } +      \\cos [ \\omega_- t - \\vec{k}_-      \\cdot \\vec{x } -\\varphi_- ] ( | e\\rangle\\langle -|\\ ,   + \\ ,   |-\\rangle      \\langle e | ) \\big \\ }   \\nonumber \\\\ & & +      \\hbar \\omega_b   \\cos [ \\omega_b t - \\varphi_b ] ( |+\\rangle      \\langle -|\\ ,   + \\ ,   |-\\rangle\\langle + |)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describes the influence of the two laser fields and the magnetic hyperfine field on the atom .",

    "first we perform the rotating wave approximation by using @xmath23 to transform the original state vector @xmath24 to @xmath25 . throughout the paper",
    "we will use the convention that a unitary transformation @xmath26 acts always in the form @xmath27 . neglecting terms oscillating with frequency @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "we obtain @xmath30 here we have set @xmath31 and have made use of the fact that the laser beams are counterpropagating and have about the same frequency so that @xmath32 is approximately equal to @xmath33 .",

    "this ambiguous treatment of frequency and wavelength of the lasers deserves a short comment .",
    "setting @xmath35 is of course an approximation which affects the momentum conservation .",
    "but since the corresponding error @xmath36 is very small compared to the vectors themselves this approximation is justified as far as momentum conservation is concerned and as long as we do not look at momenta which are of the order of @xmath37 . but setting @xmath34 would violate the energy conservation by an amount of about @xmath38 . since also @xmath39 and many other energy scales occurring in the system at hand lie in this range , this approximation would be unacceptable .",
    "the error @xmath40 in the kinetic energy caused by @xmath41 is negligible , however .    to achieve the time independence of @xmath42 it was necessary to impose the condition @xmath43 on the field frequencies",
    "this also allows us to perform the rotating wave approximation simultaneously in @xmath11 and @xmath18 . in the following",
    "we will restrict to setups where this is fulfilled . to facilitate the calculations we furthermore assume that the detunings @xmath44 of the two laser beams are equal : @xmath45 .",

    "a landau - zener transition between two states happens if in the @xmath108 matrix of the responsible hamiltonian the difference between the diagonal terms changes linearly in time while the non - diagonal terms remain constant @xcite .",

    "transition can be solved analytically .",
    "it results in a certain efficiency of a population inversion . in our case",
    "it is the following : if the atom is prepared in an initial state @xmath117 or @xmath118 the probability to find it in this state after the transition has occurred is @xmath119 this fixes for a cloud of atoms the redistribution of the population on the two levels .",
    "it is an exact result which can not be derived within perturbation theory because of its nonanalytical dependence on @xmath120 .",
    "in addition , it is known for l.z .",
    "transitions that they essentially happen at the time when the difference of the diagonal elements vanishes .",
    "this is in our case according to eq .",

    "transition can happen after a time difference @xmath122 this is just the time during which the atom s momentum is changed by the amount @xmath123 through the influence of the earth s acceleration .",
    "the order of magnitude of the effective duration of the inversion process is @xmath124    we are now able to answer the following question : for a given initial situation , at what time and between which states do l.z .",
    "transitions happen ? in a first step we analyze the equations obtained and add then below a more intuitive picture so that the underlying physics becomes even more transparent .",
    "for simplicity we use vertically oriented lasers : @xmath125 with @xmath126 whereby @xmath127 is pointing upwards .",
    "let us assume that at @xmath60 the atom is prepared with initial momentum @xmath95 in one of the states @xmath63 and @xmath128 corresponding to @xmath129 or @xmath130 , respectively .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath134 is the time at which the z - component of the measured momentum reaches @xmath144 .",
    "transition transfers to a momentum value @xmath142 , the atom starts falling again until @xmath144 is reached and so on .    for an intuitive understanding",

    "@xmath157 is shown in fig .",

    "the rapid rabi oscillations caused by the magnetic field are vertical transitions between the two curves ( no momentum transfer , the dashed arrows are examples ) . a l.z .",

    "transition at all if one starts with @xmath173 .",
    "it is important to check that the time ( [ deltat ] ) between two subsequent landau - zener transition is long enough so that each transition can be completed .",
    "this means that the time difference ( [ deltat ] ) must be large compared to @xmath174 . to check whether this condition is fulfilled for optical transitions",
    "we adopt @xmath175 hz and @xmath176 hz from ref .",

    "for @xmath19 we will assume that it can be made large enough to be one order above the effective rabi frequency @xmath185 hz .",
    "the last time scale is introduced by @xmath186 which is of the order of @xmath187 hz . inserting this into eqs .",

    "especially the discussion of fig . 3 given above revealed that the transitions due to the magnetic field are permanently present and that they are necessary to enable a chain of l.z .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to switch to a description of the process which incorporates these facts from the beginning .",
    "this can be done in referring not to @xmath76 but to dressed states of the atom with respect to the magnetic field .",

    "it is easy to show that these wave vectors are eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( [ h2 ] ) if @xmath195 .",
    "hence they are _ dressed states _ in the sense that the effect of the ( classical ) magnetic field is already taken into account .",

    "the coupling to other states is negligible because of the smallness of @xmath204 .    remembering that @xmath205 gives the probability that no transition occurs one sees that the transition probability can be very close to one if the exponent is of the order of ten or larger .",
    "since @xmath206 grows like @xmath207 the laser power needs not to be much larger than in ref .",

    "an idea about the extension in space of the cloud of trapped atoms can be obtained in the following way : it is sufficient to consider the position classically .",
    "an atom which just performed a l.z .",
    "transition moves upwards with velocity @xmath228 until after a time @xmath229 it is stopped by gravity and begins to fall .",
    "the height difference between the two positions is classically given by @xmath230 .",
    "putting in the numbers given above this height difference turns out to be about 0.5 mm .    above",
    "we have assumed a well defined initial momentum @xmath95 . for different values of @xmath95 the respective times @xmath134 ( and all @xmath135 ) differ .",
    "lifetime and extension of the trap are not changed .",
    "the trapped atoms have always vertical momenta between @xmath219 and @xmath216 and atoms leak out continuously with @xmath216 .    on the basis of this picture",
    "we can easily complete our mathematical discussion .",
    "taking again @xmath95 as initial momentum and @xmath231 at @xmath60 we find that the quantum state at later times is decomposed with regard to the states ( [ wzust ] ) with coefficients obeying at the time @xmath220 @xmath232 based on this the mean momentum at the time @xmath220 turns out to be @xmath233 where @xmath234 is that part of @xmath95 which is orthogonal to @xmath235 .",
    "these equations show how the undisturbed free fall is decelerated .",
    "we have investigated a three level @xmath0-system falling in a homogeneous gravitational field . to reverse the free fall of the atom it is exposed to two counterpropagating laser fields with wave vector @xmath236 , which induce raman transitions , and to a magnetic hyperfine field tuned to be in resonance with the transition between the two ground states @xmath152 and @xmath113 . a full quantum treatment of the coupled external and internal degrees of freedom is given .",
    "for sufficiently large detuning the excited state can be eliminated adiabatically .",
    "there remains a dynamical development which shows a. ) rabi flopping between the states @xmath152 and @xmath113 caused by the magnetic field ( no accompanying change of momentum ) , and b. ) transitions between these states with momentum transfer @xmath237 happening for certain values of the center - of - mass momentum .",
    "these transitions turn out to be of the landau - zener type .",
    "we have also given a complete description of the process with reference to dressed states ( interaction energy of the magnetic field included ) which is theoretically more elegant .",
    "in this description it becomes even more evident that the fundamental transitions are the landau - zener transitions caused by the combined influence of the lasers and the gravitational field .",
    "they disappear if one of these influences is switched off .",
    "accordingly they represent a true gravito - optical effect .",
    "the resulting center - of - mass motion is the following : if the atom starts with momentum @xmath238 it falls until @xmath239 is reached and the transition takes place .",
    "afterwards it has obtained @xmath240 , falls again until @xmath239 and so on . periodically the gravitationally caused fall ( actio )",
    "induces in combination with the influence of the lasers an internal transition ( reactio ) with momentum transfer which turns the atom into an upward motion .",
    "obviously such a process can among other applications be used to construct a coherent atom trap .",
    "it is instructive to interpret the result also in the light of the _ equivalence principle_. this method has already been used in refs .",
    "@xcite to explain the gravitational influence of atoms in an interferometer and in a running laser wave . in our case",
    "the equivalence principle states that the atom moving in the earth s gravitational field is equivalent to a free atom moving in an uniformly accelerated reference frame to which the sources of the electromagnetic fields are fixed . in this reference frame the potential term @xmath241 is absent , but the doppler effect causes the laser frequencies to change according to @xmath242 the absolute change of the magnetic field frequency @xmath18 is negligible for our argument .",
    "let the atom be initially at rest and in resonance with the lasers .",
    "if the atom now makes a transition from @xmath63 to @xmath64 it gets the momentum @xmath243 .",
    "consequently , due to the doppler effect , the atom will be out of resonance . as can be seen in eq .",
    "( [ doppl ] ) an acceleration @xmath10 which is anti - parallel to @xmath235 will decrease the momentum until the atom is in resonance again .",
    "this is the time when the next landau - zener transition can happen .",
    "consequently the atom is periodically tuned into and out of resonance with the laser fields .",
    "let us finally ask the question , what are the physical processes which abort the sequence of landau - zener transitions even for high laser powers ?",
    "the most stringent restriction comes from the breakdown of the adiabatic elimination procedure for the excited state . as we have seen above this",
    "will happen after 1/80 second .",
    "but this is about the time which lies between two subsequent transitions .",
    "hence with contemporary experimental devices we only can hope to see the onset of the transition sequence .",
    "another process which weakens the efficiency of the sequence is the coupling between @xmath208 and @xmath209 which is neglected here after the rotating wave approximation with respect to @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ dglw ] ) . since it is likely that an @xmath19 exceeding @xmath92 by several powers of ten can not be produced with the present technology this effect can be relevant .",
    "numerical investigations indicate that for @xmath244 the population transfer from @xmath208 to @xmath209 is in the order of 10 % .",
    "we therefore expect that this process will interrupt the landau - zener sequence after a few transitions .",
    "+ _ note added : _ after the submission of this paper we became aware of a preprint @xcite reporting the measurement of bloch oscillations of atoms .",
