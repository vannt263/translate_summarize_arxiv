    "dynamical assignment of the highly excited eigenstates of a polyatomic molecule is a topic of significant interest to the chemical physics community@xcite .",
    "insights into the nature of the excited states provides for a better understanding of the phenomenon of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution ( ivr ) occuring in the molecule@xcite .",
    "assignment of the low energy vibrational states in terms of the usual normal mode quantum numbers is relatively straightforward .",
    "however with increasing energies the normal mode quantum numbers are no longer conserved due to perturbations that strongly mix the zeroth order modes and the molecular vibrational hamiltonian@xcite takes the form : @xmath3 wherein @xmath4 represents the dunham expansion , @xmath5 are the anharmonic constants and @xmath6 are the various perturbations .",
    "the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 represent the annhilation and creation operators for the @xmath9 mode respectively .",
    "the normal mode quantum numbers @xmath10 , sufficient for assigning low energy eigenstates , do not commute with @xmath6 and hence can not be used to assign the eigenstates of @xmath11 .",
    "the above hamiltonian is usually generated from a fit to the experimental spectrum in the absence of a global _ ab initio _ potential energy surface . even in the case when an accurate potential energy surface is at hand it is possible , and useful , to generate a hamiltonian of the above form using the canonical van - vleck perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "the advantages of using hamiltonians of the above form stems from the fact that the classical limit hamiltonian @xmath12 is easily obtained via the correspondence @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14-dimensional vector @xmath15 has integer components @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the action - angle variables@xcite corresponding to @xmath4 .",
    "the order of a resonance@xcite is defined as @xmath18 .",
    "the perturbations @xmath19 are called resonant because the condition @xmath20 implies a specific commensurability or locking between the unperturbed frequencies @xmath21 .",
    "such resonances are responsible for energy flow through the molecule and lead to breakdown of the zeroth order , low energy quantum numbers .",
    "classical dynamics of resonant hamiltonians is historically very rich and have been studied in great detail@xcite . in particular a detailed understanding of the classical dynamics of @xmath22",
    "is essential for any dynamical assignment of the quantum eigenstates of @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore the effective hamiltonian approach utilizes the state space perspective which offers considerable advantages towards understanding ivr@xcite .    clearly",
    "any assignment of the eigenstates of @xmath11 formally requires the existence of a sufficiently large set of good quantum numbers .",
    "such a set does not exist in general and hence assignment implies the existence of at least approximate or quasi quantum numbers . by necessity",
    "such approximate quantum numbers are conserved for a certain time period dictated by the dynamics of the system .",
    "support for the notion of quasi quantum numbers partially comes from the experimental observation@xcite of hierarchical ivr in molecules and the fact that most molecules are not ergodic even at fairly high energies@xcite . in this sense deciphering the quantum numbers ,",
    "exact or approximate , invariably implies the knowledge of the underlying dynamics .",
    "consequently one speaks of a dynamical assignment of the eigenstates wherein some or all of the quantum numbers arise by focusing on important quantum and or classical dynamical structures .",
    "a consistent picture that is emerging from many studies is that the complicated spectral splittings and patterns at high energies can be ` unzipped ' to some extent using the underlying classical dynamics .",
    "more specifically , _ the spectra are unzipped by recognizing eigenstates showing similar localization characteristics about important classical invariant structures in the underlying phase space_.    studies based on classical - quantum correspondence have been successfully applied to systems with two coupled modes@xcite but are yet to be extended to systems with three or more coupled modes _",
    "i.e. , _ multimode systems@xcite .",
    "the technical and conceptual difficulties associated with a straightforward generalization of the two mode techniques to multimode systems are well understood@xcite .",
    "circumventing the technical difficulty , in our opinion , requires utilizing quantum objects which are sensitive to the underlying classical mechanics but do not rely on visualizing the phase space and eigenstates .",
    "considerable work has been done in this direction and a common theme underlying such approaches is the analysis of the eigenvalues and their variation with hamiltonian parameters@xcite .",
    "for instance the nature of an eigenstate @xmath23 of @xmath11 has been studied using the methods of diabatic correlations@xcite revealing the existence of formal quantum numbers .",
    "the basic quantity in these studies is the variation of the eigenvalue @xmath24 with a specific coupling strength _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath25",
    ". remarkable correlation of the level variations to the phase space nature of the eigenstates had been noted by weissman and jortner in the context of the henon - heiles system@xcite .",
    "support for the correlation was provided recently@xcite from a semiclassical viewpoint and it was suggested that the parametric variations were sensitive to the various bifurcations occuring in the classical phase space . however strong support for the observed correlations",
    "have existed@xcite in the literature in terms of the classical - quantum correspondence of quantum expectation values _",
    "i.e. , _ diagonal matrix elements .",
    "in order to elucidate the connections we note that the hellman - feynman theorem @xmath26 suggests the diagonal matrix element of the perturbation as the fundamental object .",
    "@xmath27 represents the polyad , associated with the resonance @xmath6 , whose constancy is destroyed in the presence of other independent resonant perturbations .",
    "consequently@xcite dominance of @xmath28 at a single @xmath27 implies a highly localized @xmath23 in the state space with @xmath27 being an approximate quantum number .",
    "quantum mechanically if @xmath29 is large then it is expected that the perturbation @xmath6 plays a role in determining the nature of @xmath23 . on the other hand",
    "a semiclassical analysis of the expectation value provides valuable information on the phase space nature of @xmath23 .",
    "this can be seen by considering the quantity @xmath30 which is the expectation values of @xmath6 weighted by the density of states .",
    "such quantities lend themselves to an elegant semiclassical interpretation in terms of the classical closed orbits in the phase space .",
    "this is hardly surprising given that the genesis of the gutzwiller periodic orbit quantization@xcite idea was from a semiclassical analysis of the quantum density of states @xmath31 . as the method of semiclassical analysis of @xmath32",
    "is well established in the literature and our intention in this work is not to semiclassically evaluate @xmath33 we will highlight the salient features .",
    "in general @xmath34 has a smooth and oscillating part with the smooth part being independent of the nature of the classical dynamics .",
    "the oscillating part is sensitive to the nature of the dynamics and can be written down in terms of a sum over the closed orbits in the phase space .",
    "if the phase space is chaotic then the closed orbits are the various periodic orbits whereas for a regular phase space the closed orbits are the rational tori . in either case",
    "it can be shown@xcite that the oscillating part depends inversely on the determinant of the stability matrix @xmath35 of the closed orbit and directly on the quantity @xmath36 representing the average of the resonant term over one period @xmath37 of the closed orbit .",
    "we emphasise the dependence of @xmath34 on the quantities @xmath35 and @xmath38 for two reasons .",
    "firstly , @xmath38 clearly underscores the important role played by the classical analog of @xmath6 .",
    "further , performing a standard canonical transformation @xmath39 with @xmath40 being the slow angle and action variables specific to the resonant term @xmath41 we obtain @xmath42 now for a closed orbit in the phase space corresponding to @xmath43 the angles @xmath44 are fast and can be averaged resulting in the actions @xmath45 .",
    "the fixed points for the averaged system are then determined by @xmath46 and correspond to the closed orbit in the full phase space . within this averaged viewpoint @xmath47 with the signs coming from @xmath48 .",
    "thus it is expected that a maximum in @xmath49 comes from the localization of the eigenstate @xmath23 due to closed orbits associated with @xmath6 .",
    "evidently states influenced by a particular closed orbit can be classified into a group and identified by patterns in the @xmath33 `` spectrum '' . in mixed phase",
    "space regimes , generic to molecular systems , periodic orbits with varied stabilities can exist and influence the dynamics . in the following sections we show the expectation values which are scaled to unit variance and zero centered .",
    "the scaling is performed to remove the dependence@xcite of @xmath50 on the approximate polyad @xmath27 arising from the localization of the eigenstate @xmath23 due to @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , bifurcations in the phase space are signalled by the vanishing@xcite of the determinant @xmath51 . in general bifurcations",
    "imply birth of new orbits and/or death of old orbits . in the molecular context@xcite",
    "such bifurcations manifest themselves as destruction of the old modes and creation of the new modes which influence the eigenstates .",
    "for instance a normal to local transition with varying energy arises due to bifurcations in the classical phase space .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that the @xmath33 `` spectrum '' will exhibit the effects of the various bifurcations .",
    "recent work from our group has demonstrated the usefulness of the above method for understanding the highly excited states of a model system@xcite and the dco radical@xcite . in this letter",
    "two molecules , chbrclf and c@xmath2h@xmath2 , are chosen as further examples to illustrate the method .",
    "specifically , the @xmath52 polyad of chbrclf and the @xmath1^{g+}$ ] bending polyad of c@xmath2h@xmath2 are investigated . in section",
    "ii the highly excited states of chbrclf are analyzed and compared to a recent work@xcite .",
    "we find some discrepancy in the dynamical assignments provided earlier and by the level velocity method . in section",
    "iii the pure bending states of c@xmath2h@xmath2 are investigated and it is shown that the level velocity approach is capable of identifying the new class of local bending and counter - rotation states . comparing to a recent work@xcite",
    "we show that the level velocity approach is successful in identifying important eigenstate sequences at such high levels of excitation .",
    "section iv concludes .",
    "an effective hamiltonian for chbrclf was proposed by beil _",
    "on the basis of their detailed study of the rovibrational spectra@xcite .",
    "the ch overtone spectrum implicated multiple fermi resonances involving the pure ch stretch @xmath53 and the two @xmath54 ch bending vibrations .",
    "the spectroscopic hamiltonian has the form : @xmath55 the zeroth - order anharmonic part is diagonal in the number @xmath56 basis @xmath57 with the @xmath58 and @xmath59 being the harmonic frequencies and anharmonicities of the three modes respectively .",
    "the perturbations @xmath60 are off - diagonal in the @xmath56 basis and represent resonant coupling of the modes .",
    "the first three perturbation terms in the hamiltonian are fermi resonances between the ch stretch and the various bend modes whereas the last perturbation is a darling - dennison resonance between the two bend modes .",
    "the structure of the effective hamiltonian implies the existence of a constant of the motion @xmath61 called as the polyad number . for the various parameter values and form of the resonant operators we refer the reader to the earlier works@xcite .",
    "however , we note that the bending mode anharmonicities @xmath62 are small and the resonant coupling strengths are rather large .",
    "for instance , @xmath63 @xmath64 and the stretching mode anharmonicity @xmath65 @xmath64 whereas @xmath66 @xmath64 .",
    "such large resonant strengths combined with reduced bend anharmonic constants imply that any analysis solely based on @xmath4 would be inadequate .",
    "we also report the inverse participation ratios ( ipr ) of the eigenstates in various basis .",
    "the ipr @xmath67 of an eigenstate @xmath23 in a basis @xmath68 is given by @xmath69 .",
    "@xmath67 is a measure of the extent of delocalization of an eigenstate in a specific basis .",
    "a high @xmath67 indicates localization in the state space whereas for a completely delocalized state @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the total number of states .     for ( a ) lowest and ( b ) highest energy states in a polyad for chbrclf .",
    "the circles , squares and triangles represent the expectation values of @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and the @xmath74 respectively .",
    "the iprs for the two sets of states are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) .",

    "[ fig1]a , b we show the relevant expectation values as a function of increasing @xmath80 for the lowest and highest energy states respectively in a given polyad .",
    "the expectation values of @xmath81 are relatively small and hence not shown in the figures .",
    "the iprs in the zeroth order basis and various integrable single resonant basis are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]c , d . for the lowest energy state",
    "it is clear that the @xmath82-fermi resonance plays an important role .",
    "this is evident from the ipr information as well since the @xmath82 single resonance basis values are fairly high for the range of @xmath80 shown . on the other hand",
    "the highest energy states show the importance of the @xmath83-fermi resonance .",
    "the sharp rise in the expectation value corresponding to @xmath84 between @xmath85 and @xmath86 indicates a change in the nature of the dynamics which is confirmed by studying the surface of sections . in both instances",
    "the dominance of a single @xmath87 and the corresponding single resonance basis ipr establishes the states to be regular and highly localized .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the relevant @xmath87 are shown for the eigenstates in @xmath52 .",
    "note that a large @xmath49 implies a localized state in the corresponding state space resonance zone and also in the phase space about a closed orbit .",
    "the nature of the closed orbit _",
    "i.e. , _ stable or unstable is inferred from the sign of @xmath33 .",
    "a look at the partial expectation values @xmath88 will reveal a single dominant contribution leading to the assignment @xmath89 with @xmath90 denoting an excitation index for states with the same @xmath27 .",
    "we will not give a list of assignments for the states in @xmath52 but rather focus on certain eigenstate sequences in order to compare to a recent work@xcite . at first glance",
    "it is apparent that the @xmath82 resonance is influencing the lower end of the polyad whereas the @xmath83 resonance is important for the higher energy states .",
    "note , however , that with increasing energy the @xmath83 rapidly gains significance with concomitant decrease in the @xmath82 influence . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it is seen that around 12020 @xmath64 @xmath91 and the sequence splits into two branches .",
    "this indicates a change in the underlying phase space and thus localization nature of the eigenstates on the two branches should be different .",
    "this is supported by examining the phase space and the alternating assignments provided in a recent work@xcite . at the same time towards the middle of the polyad the darling - dennison resonance is playing a key role in organizing the eigenstates .",
    "we plot the @xmath87 versus the energy eigenvalues @xmath24 since this immediately reveals the states that are possibly involved in avoided crossings . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] certain sequences have been shown and labeled according to a classification done recently . in this classification@xcite",
    "@xmath92 represent nonresonant states , and @xmath93 represent states influenced by the darling - dennison resonance . from the expectation values , however , it is not apparent that the first few states are nonresonant .",
    "indeed our analysis suggests some of these states , for instance the first three states , are influenced by the @xmath82 fermi resonance . that this is indeed the case has been confirmed by the method of local frequency analysis which shows extensive @xmath82 locking .",
    "in addition the corresponding iprs in the single @xmath82 resonance basis are very high suggesting strong influence by the resonance .",

    "our assignment for the state denoted @xmath99 is @xmath100 and clearly the approximate polyad @xmath101 can be identified with the longitudinal quantum number @xmath102 introduced in the earlier work@xcite .",

    "existence of localized states and their sequences can be ascertained by inspecting the expectation values ( magnitude and sign ) and the iprs irrespective of wether the classical phase space is ( near)-integrable , mixed or chaotic . in case of complete chaos , from random matrix theory arguments ,",
    "a typical expectation value is expected@xcite to be @xmath180 .",
    "the examples studied here are quite far from such a limit . combined with the relative signs of the expectation",
    "values it is possible to identify specific eigenstate sequences .",
    "sensitivity of the expectation values to the bifurcations provides information on the birth of new types of modes and the resulting perturbations on the eigenstate sequences .",
    "currently it is not possible to identify the type of bifurcation that occurs and this aspect needs further study .",
    "it is important to note that we are not advocating the use of periodic orbits to compute the expectation values which is a difficult task .",
    "instead we are emphasizing the manifestation and utility of such classical structures in a fundamental quantum object _",
    "i.e. , _ an expectation value .",
    "similar philosophy has been adopted in the vibrogram or @xmath181 approaches to study resonant systems@xcite this classical - quantum correspondence aspect of the expectation values can be easily applied to multidimensional coupled systems without the need for determining / visualization of phase space , periodic orbits or eigenstates .",
    "indeed preliminary work on a coupled 4-mode",
    "effective hamiltonian suggests that such an approach is useful .",
    "finally we note that jacobson and field have recently@xcite studied expectation values of resonance operators for a nonstationary state . choosing the nonstationary state to be a zeroth order bright state @xmath182 it was shown that the time - dependent expectations @xmath183 indicate the resonances important for dynamics over a particular time interval .",
    "relation to the present work is realized by the fact that @xmath184 thus the time - dependent expectations are , in the infinite time limit , nothing but intensity weighted eigenstate expectation values .",
    "such an object , the intensity - velocity correlator , has been recently introduced and studied in great detail@xcite .",
