    "tb@xmath0ga@xmath1o@xmath2 ( tgg ) is a dielectric material with a cubic garnet structure .",
    "each tb@xmath3 ion has the same @xmath4 symmetry in its own local coordinate system which leads to pronounced crystal field ( cef ) effects in various physical properties .",
    "tgg exhibits a transition to a antiferromagnetically ordered phase at 0.35k ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the terbium ions are located on inter - penetrating triangular lattices , but they do not form a simple kagome lattice , where the triangles lie in a plane , but are arrayed in three dimensions , forming a so - called hyperkagome lattice @xcite , which like the kagome lattice is geometrically frustrated .",
    "various interesting experiments have been performed recently with this substance .",
    "one of them is the phonon hall effect . in analogy to the classical hall effect in conducting materials , the appearance of a thermal gradient in the direction perpendicular to both , the applied magnetic field and the thermal flux , was observed @xcite .",
    "another experiment is the acoustic faraday effect where the rotation of a linearly polarized ultrasonic wave in a magnetic field applied along the propagation direction was observed and quantitatively analyzed @xcite . in another experiment the temperature dependence of the symmetry",
    "elastic constants were measured and interpreted with a simple cef - model @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show , that a cef - hamiltonian for the orthorhombic sorroundings of the tb ions is well fitted to describe the low energy spectrum and the thermodynamic properties of tgg .",
    "we expect that this is also of intereset for a detailed model of transport phenomena like the phonon hall effect .",
    "first we discuss the cef - hamiltonian , next we calculate the the magnetization in the three important crystal directions in high magnetic field and compare the result with existing experiments @xcite .",
    "afterwards we show experimental results of the magnetic susceptibility and compare it with analogous calculations .",
    "finally we discuss our esr results and interpret them using the same cef - model .",
    "a tb@xmath3 ion has 8 4f - electrons leading with hund s rule to s=3 , l=3 and j=6 .",
    "the cef for these ions with local orthorhombic symmetry can be described with a hamiltonian , introduced by guillot et al .",
    "@xcite in 1985 , which in our notation reads :      here @xmath6 is the magnetic field in the local coordinate system of a tb@xmath3 ion .",
    "the @xmath7 are the stevens operators as defined in @xcite , and the @xmath8 are the crystal field parameters .",
    "the @xmath8 can be calculated from the @xmath9 given in ref .",
    "we list the @xmath9 from @xcite in table [ table1 ] and give the explicit relation between the @xmath9 and the @xmath8 in the appendix . for a detailed discussion of the conventions used in defining the crystal field parameters see e.g.@xcite .",
