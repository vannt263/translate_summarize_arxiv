    "if we are to understand the nature of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , it is crucial to fully explore the available range of parameter space and in particular study objects which display the most extreme behaviour .",
    "one such object is the nearby quasar pds  456 , which was discovered by torres et al .",
    "they suggested it was intrinsically more luminous than 3c  273 , traditionally taken to be the most luminous object in the `` local universe '' ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "our follow - up observations confirmed that pds  456 is more luminous than 3c  273 in the optical , with @xmath5 ( simpson et al .",
    "the reason pds  456 was not discovered sooner is due to its sky location , near the galactic bulge , resulting in galactic extinction of e(b@xmath6v ) = 0.48 .",
    "unlike 3c  273 , vla radio data show pds  456 to be radio - quiet with a typical optical - to - radio luminosity ratio for that class ( simpson et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting its high luminosity is not due to doppler boosting of the continuum . in the near - infrared and optical pds  456 is effectively a `` twin '' of 3c  273 in terms of its continuum shape , and displays a rich emission - line spectrum in which the balmer and paschen lines have very broad wings ( fwzi @xmath7kms@xmath0 ) and the fe  ii lines are strong .",

    "2002 ; reeves , obrien & ward 2003 ) . to fit these data",
    "requires the presence of a large column ( @xmath15 @xmath16 ) of highly ionized material ( log @xmath17 ) .",
    "this material is outflowing at @xmath18 km s@xmath0 , which translates to a mass of @xmath19 yr@xmath0 for a conservative covering factor of 0.1 steradian .",
    "similar , but less extreme , high - velocity outflows have also been observed in other agn , ( chartas et al .",
    "2002 ; chartas , brandt & gallagher 2003 ; pounds et al .",
    "2003a , b ; dasgupta et al .",
    "an alternative viewpoint has been expressed that some of the absorption could be due to local hot gas ( e.g. mckernan , yaqoob & reynolds 2004 ) .",
    "while this may explain a modest column of soft x - ray absorbing gas , such a model does not provide a good fit to the strong fe k - band features seen in pds  456 and has no explanation in terms of the known local galactic environment .",
    "correcting for the galactic and intrinsic absorption , pds  456 has an x - ray luminosity of l(210 kev ) @xmath20ergs@xmath0 ( adopting h@xmath21 km s@xmath0 mpc@xmath0 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "this is about a tenth of the x - ray luminosity of 3c  273 , but pds  456 has an optical / x - ray luminosity ratio within the known range for radio - quiet agn ( e.g. yuan et al .",
    "the x - ray variability of pds  456 is extreme for such a luminous radio - quiet object .",
    "it varies by factors of two in just 30 ks , repeating this behaviour almost every day ( reeves et al .",
    "overall , the luminosity , variability and spectral characteristics of pds  456 strongly suggest it is an object running at an unusually high accretion rate , with a massive x - ray outflow driven by radiation and/or magnetic field",
    ".    the x - ray properties of pds  456 clearly show it to be an extraordinary object . to explore its nature further , we report here on a hst uv observation which reveal a further set of extreme properties . in the following sections we describe the hst observation of pds  456 and the derived spectral characteristics .",
    "we then discuss how the uv data suggest a connection between the x - ray and uv properties and how pds  456 could help us understand the connection between agn with and without broad absorption lines and explain the origin of at least part of the broad emission line region .",
    "we observed pds  456 with the hst space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) on 2000 may 14 .",

    "the absence of a sharp low - velocity core in ly@xmath3/n  v @xmath26 and c  iv @xmath2 results in both these features having about half the rest - frame equivalent widths ( 38 and 22  respectively ) of those in 3c  273 or in the mean hst spectrum .",

    ". the ratios of the higher ionization broad lines to ly@xmath3 in pds  456 are at the high end of the observed distribution for agn .",
    "the biggest difference in broad line properties for pds  456 comes when comparing the blueshifts .",
    "it is well known that high - ionization broad emission - lines are often blueshifted relative to the low - ionization lines ( e.g. wilkes 1984 , espey et al .",
    "1989 ) , but the blueshifts are usually modest . for 794 radio - quiet quasars",

    "s@xmath0 , pds  456 has the largest c  iv blueshift known to date .    to explain the c  iv @xmath2 emission - line blueshifts , richards et al .",
    "( 2002 ) propose an absorption model , in which objects with larger blueshifts are those in which the red wing of the emission - line has been absorbed .",
    "we note that pds  456 has a c  iv blueshift about double that of any object in the richards et al .",
    "sub - dividing their sample by increasing amounts of blueshift , richards et al .",
    "find those with larger blueshifts have a weaker than average ly@xmath3/n  v @xmath26 ratio and weaker he  ii @xmath46 , but a similar si  iv / o  iv @xmath28 ratio .",
    "although at first sight pds  456 does not seem to violate these trends , if we wish to explain the blueshift by saying c  iv is strongly absorbed in the red wing it would imply a very large amount of absorption , an extremely large velocity range for the `` unabsorbed '' line and would not explain why it looks similar in profile to ly@xmath3/n  v @xmath26 and a similarly blueshifted , albeit noisy , si  iv / o  iv feature .",
    "broad uv absorption features of similar strength and velocity width to that of the ly@xmath3 absorption feature seen in pds  456 are seen in broad absorption - line quasars ( bals ; e.g. turnshek 1984 ) .",
    "however , we do not unambiguously detect the usual n  v @xmath26 and c  iv @xmath2 bals .",
    "unfortunately the mg  ii @xmath55 feature falls at the atmospheric cut - off of the optical spectrum and is beyond the range of the hst spectrum .",
    "hence we can not place firm constraints on the ionization state of the uv absorber .",
    "it could be argued that the uv broad absorption feature in pds  456 is actually highly blueshifted n  v @xmath26 absorption , but then we can not explain the lack of strong c  iv @xmath2 absorption as both lines are commonly seen , with similar strength , in bal quasars .",
    "similarly , if we assume the lack of a narrow emission - line core in ly@xmath3 is due to n  v @xmath26 absorption , this would place the n  v bal at a much lower velocity than the ly@xmath3 absorption .",
    "the detection of a single bal feature poses a problem in comparing with traditional bal quasars and it could be argued pds  456 is a different sort of agn .",
    "nevertheless , we discuss pds  456 below in the context of such objects .",
    "the origin of the bal phenomenon in qsos is unclear , but recent studies suggest they are drawn from the same parent population as other quasars ( reichard et al .",
    "if so , that implies bals are present in all agn but are only visible from certain orientations ( e.g. weymann et al .",
    "many bal acceleration mechanisms have been proposed , such as line - driving ( murray et al .",
    "1995 ) or hydromagnetic driving ( knigl & kartje 1994 ) .",
    "line - driven winds models are the most commonly considered .",
    "the observed ionization state of the uv absorbing gas implies it must be shielded from the full ionizing continuum ( murray et al . ) and such gas arises naturally in simulations of line - driven accretion disk winds ( e.g. proga , stone & kallman 2000 ) .",
    "the shielding gas has sufficient column density to provide significant soft x - ray absorption in bal quasars , as appears to be the case for some objects ( e.g. , gallagher et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in the context of bal wind models ,",
    "pds  456 could be viewed as a high - ionization analogue of the bal quasars , in which the bulk of the absorbing gas , including the `` shield '' , has been ionized , and is observed as a high ionization , high - velocity absorber in the x - ray ( reeves , obrien & ward 2003 ) .",
    "the implied high accretion rate and large c  iv blueshift in pds  456 are properties associated with an increased likelyhood of absorption / bals ( reichard et al .",
    "2003 ; gallagher et al .",
    "however , this apparent similarity should not be taken as proof that the x - ray outflow gas in pds  456 is simply driven in the same way as a bal .",
    "it is hard to envisage a scenario in which a highly - ionized , high velocity outflow such as that in pds  456 is driven purely by line or continuum radiation ( see also everett & ballantyne 2004 ) .",
    "the evidence for magnetic flaring in pds  456 ( reeves et al .",
    "2002 ) suggest rather that hydromagnetic driving could be an important driving mechanism .",
    "if so , the geometry of the outflow need not be along the disk plane , as commonly invoked for accretion disk wind models . we note that the kinetic energy of the x - ray outflow ( @xmath56 erg s@xmath0 ) is comparable to the energy input required to explain the largest radio galaxies , assuming they are built over @xmath57 yr .",
    "the outflow could , therefore , be viewed as a wider , slower , higher - mass version of a relativistic jet .",
    "pds  456 has a far - infrared luminosity comparable to that of an ultra - luminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) , such as arp  220 , but it has a relatively low co luminosity ( yun et al .",
    "2004 ) , and hence a relatively low mass of molecular gas .",
    "yun et al . suggest that it may be evolving from being a ulirg into a qso .",
    "the massive , highly - ionized outflow in pds  456 , indicative of a massive black hole accreting at a high rate , may then be due to it having undergone a recent `` accretion event '' which has triggered a phase of high activity .",
    "pds  456 may therefore be a relatively young , or refuelled , agn , which would help explain it having a bolometric luminosity more typical of @xmath58 objects .",
    "the large outflow velocity found for the x - ray absorber ( blueshift @xmath18 km s@xmath0 ) is much larger than that of the uv broad absorption ( blueshift 1400024000 km s@xmath0 ) and the broad emission lines ( blueshifts up to 5000 km s@xmath0 ) .",
    "one possibility is that the uv features are due to a decelerating , cooling outflow . in this scenario",
    "the x - ray outflow could be the source of at least some of the blr , most likely the high - ionization gas component .",
    "the mass - loss rate derived from the x - ray data of @xmath1 yr@xmath0 is more than sufficient to replenish the @xmath59 m@xmath60 of gas required to explain the observed c  iv @xmath8 1549 emission . to constrain this model we need to place firm limits on the n  v , si  iv and c  iv absorption features which are commonly seen in bal quasars .",
    "if no uv high - ionization absorption were detected but only ly@xmath3 , that could imply the ly@xmath3 absorber is a different component , which would be curious given its similar blueshift to the highly - ionized x - ray absorbing material . to obtain a higher - quality uv spectrum",
    "requires the repair of hst or the provision of a replacement . also crucial",
    "to constraining the otuflow will be a recently approved higher - resolution astro - e2/xrs observation .",
    "these data will probe the velocity and ionization structure and possibly reveal lower ionization x - ray features analagous to those seen in the uv .",
