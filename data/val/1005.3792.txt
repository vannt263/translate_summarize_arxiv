    "the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ has detected more than a hundred of blazars in the 100 mev100 gev range @xcite and allowed their detailed spectral studies with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "a surprising result is that the spectra of high - luminosity sources , flat - spectra radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and low - energy synchrotron peaked bl lac objects , are much better described by a broken power law than by a simple powerlaw or any smoothly curved models @xcite .",
    "the break energies , mostly lying in the 210 gev range ( as measured in the object frame ) , seem to be too small to be produced by the @xmath0-ray absorption due to photon ",
    "photon pair production in the broad - line region ( blr ) , as the strongest blr line , ly@xmath1 , absorbs @xmath0-rays starting from only 25.6 gev .",
    "the observed spectral breaks are also too sharp and the change in the spectral indices are too large to be associated with the cooling or the klein - nishina effects @xcite .    calculations of the @xmath0-ray absorption within the blr are usually limited to the contribution from lines in the observed optical band ( e.g. @xcite ) with a few exceptions @xcite .",
    "theoretical models , however , predict strong helium uv lines as well as metal lines in the soft x - rays ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , because a typical quasar spectrum has a power law tail extending to the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "in addition to the lines , there are strong recombination continua of hydrogen and heii at 13.6 and 54.4 ev , respectively .",
    "these sharp , line - like features cause jumps in the @xmath0-ray opacity at @xmath219.2 and 4.8 gev . we propose here that the observed spectral breaks in blazars are produced by absorption on photons of these recombination continua .",
    "the blr around quasars is known to emit a number of strong lines associated with very different ionization stages .",
    "reverberation mapping of seyfert galaxies and quasars using the civ @xmath31549 line showed that the size of the blr scales with the luminosity as @xcite @xmath4 the estimated blr size is , however , 23 times larger for the balmer lines and 3 times smaller for high - ionization heii @xmath31640 and nv @xmath31240 lines @xcite .",
    "this argues in favor of strong radial ionization stratification of the blr spanning over an order of magnitude in radius .",
    "the blr spectrum is thus very much dependent on the distance from the central ionizing source .    using spectral synthesis code xstar ( version 2.2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we generated a grid of photoionization models of blr clouds assumed to be simple slabs of constant gas density and a clear view to the ionizing source .",
    "for simplicity , we fix the cloud column density at @xmath5 @xmath6 and vary the ionization parameter @xmath7 from 10@xmath8 to 10@xmath9 .",
    "we assume a gradual change of the cloud density as a function of distance from the central source , @xmath10 .",
    "taking @xmath11 @xmath12 at the inner edge of the blr , the distances @xmath13 to the ionizing source are between 0.03 ( @xmath14 ) and 1 pc ( @xmath15 ) for a quasar luminosity @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 .",
    "this blr model is broadly consistent with the constraints from reverberation mapping @xcite .",
    "it is , of course , still an oversimplification , but this is enough to show the impact of blr on propagation of the gev photons .",
    "the quasar spectrum is taken as a sum of the standard multicolor accretion disk plus a power law of total luminosity 10% and extending to 100 kev @xcite .",
    "the resulting blr spectra are shown in figure [ fig : blr](a ) .",
    "their absolute normalization depend on the covering fraction of the blr clouds .",
    "if it does not vary dramatically over distance , the radiation field at a given radius is dominated by the locally produced photons corresponding to a specific ionization parameter . as our aim is not the study of the blr emission , but its effect on the high - energy photon propagation , we smooth the spectrum to show the most significant features ( see table [ tbl : blr ] ) . in the high - ionization zone at small distances to the central source , heii ly lines and recombination continuum at 4060 ev are relatively strong .",
    "there are also significant soft x - ray lines of oviii and cvi , which are important for estimation of the @xmath2500 mev photon propagation . in the low - ionization zone at larger distances , hydrogen ly lines and recombination continuum",
    "dominate the photon flux with the additional strong lines from civ , cv , hei , heii , as well as helium recombination continua .",

    "if the ionization is high , the dominant photon source is the heii complex at 4060 ev ( see table [ tbl : blr ] ) , which produces a break in opacity at 47 gev . above 10 gev ,",
    "the opacity is a rather smooth function of energy with additional absorption coming from hei , hydrogen ly lines and recombination continuum , and cv @xmath32274 . in the 0.30.7 gev region",
    "the opacity has another break due to high - ionization lines of ovii .",
    "detection of this break requires @xmath46 , which certainly is enough to completely absorb the gev radiation .    in the low - ionization environment ,",
    "the strongest absorption is produced by hydrogen ly lines and recombination continuum , forcing a break in opacity at about 2030 gev .",
    "at the same time , the break due to helium is also clearly visible at a few gev .",
    "the breaks below 1 gev would be probably impossible to detect due to low opacity at these energies .",
    "the opacity is nearly flat up to 1 tev @xcite because of the contribution from additional lines : mgii @xmath32800 , h@xmath1 , and hei @xmath310832 .",
    "the breaks at 47 and 2030 gev are expected for a large range of ionization parameters .",
    "the total opacity in 550 gev range can therefore be very roughly represented as a sum of opacities resulting from two `` lines '' at ionization energies of heii and hi , 54.4 and 13.6 ev , taken in different proportions .",
    "the opacity in these lines can be characterized by the optical depths @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which reflect the column density of photons at respective energies via equation ( [ eq : taut ] ) . in this simple approximation , which we will call a double - absorber model , the breaks appear at 4.8 and 19.2 gev .",
    "we analyze the data for several brightest fsrqs from the sample of 12 objects in table 1 in @xcite and choose the same 180 day interval for easier comparison .",
    "we can not use the standard software distributed by the lat team , because it does not contain the required spectral models .",
    "instead , we wrote our own version and check its performance , by comparing its results for the simple broken power law models with those obtained by @xcite using the standard maximum likelihood analysis tool _ gtlike_. we excluded three objects for which our simplified analysis is not adequate : 4c+38.41 and pks 0528 + 134 , because of severe source confusion , and pks 1908201 since it is close to the galactic bulge and the background is high .",
    "we use class 3 ( diffuse ) photons and impose the cuts at zenith angle @xmath49105@xmath50 and incident angle to the detector axis @xmath4960@xmath50 .",
    "the latter cut excludes counts with very low value of the detector response and restricts variation of the count weight by factor @xmath22.7 .",
    "we used ` p6_v3_diffuse ` version of the response function .",
    "the background was measured in a circle with the radius 6@xmath50 , separated from the object by @xmath215@xmath50 and avoiding local sources .",
    "we accumulate counts in the circle centered at the source location with the energy - dependent radius @xmath51 ( which corresponds to 95% containment ) .    at this stage",
    ", we are not interested in the absolute normalization of the spectrum , but only in its shape , therefore our strategy is to sample the response function at photon arrival times ( rather than integrating it over time ) .",
    "as the energy resolution in the range of interest ( 130 gev ) is good enough , we can treat the response matrix as diagonal and just prescribe to each photon the weight inversely proportional to the effective area for the given energy and incident angle .",
    "we restrict the spectral fit to energies above 200 mev .",
    "we use binned fitting as it provides us with a very simple and clear indicator of the fit quality , @xmath52 .",
    "for a few bins at high energies , where the number of photons is low , we use poisson likelihood adding @xmath53 to @xmath52 ( here @xmath54 is the number of counts in the bin and @xmath55 is the prediction of the model ) .",
    "the number of such bins is small and the meaning of @xmath52 is not significantly affected . for the minimization we use the standard code minuit from the cern library .",
    "first , we fit the data with a simple power law model . for five objects out of nine from our sample ,",
    "the fits are acceptable ( @xmath56 for 12 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "next , we apply the broken power law model with parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and free normalization ( see table [ tbl : data ] ) .",
    "there is a good agreement with the results by @xcite , except for rgb j0920 + 446 ( where the best - fit parameters given by @xcite evidently do not match the spectrum of the object presented in the same paper ) and for pks 0454234 ( where our minimization routine probably found a different local minimum ) .",
    "the breaks are not statistically significant in pks 151008 , 3c 273 , pks 202207 , and txs 1520 + 319 .",
    "finally , we have fitted the data with a power law and the double - absorber model taking optical depths @xmath47 and @xmath48 , photon index @xmath59 and normalization as free parameters .",
    "the `` lines '' were redshifted by the appropriate @xmath60 factor .",
    "the fits give statistically significant detections of absorption with a good @xmath52 for 3c 454.3 , pks 1502 + 106 , pks 0454234 , and rgb j0920 + 446 ( see table [ tbl : data ] and figure [ fig : agn ] ) .",
    "upper limits on absorption for pks 151008 , pks 202207 , and txs 1520 + 319 are significantly smaller than the absorption optical depth for 3c 454.3 .",
    "there are no significant constraints for 3c 273 .",
    "the quality of the fits with the absorption model is about the same as with the broken power law model with the same number of parameters .",
    "in fact , the absorption model is less flexible as the energy , where the power law spectrum breaks , is fixed .",
    "the gev breaks observed in blazars are well described by @xmath0-ray absorption via photon ",
    "photon pair production on heii and hi recombination continuum photons . in rgb j0920 + 446",
    ", the absorption is seen only at high energies with the break energy @xmath58 corresponding to the pair - production threshold on hydrogen recombination photons , while in other cases the break is close to the threshold for the absorption on heii recombination continuum .",
    "the exact position of the break depends on the ionization parameter that determines the contribution of metals and affects the position of the centroid of the 50 ev complex . if @xmath47 is small , then the break shifts to 19 gev as observed in rgb j0920 + 446 .",
    "a rather large ratio of the fitted optical depths @xmath61 , implies that the @xmath0-ray emitting region has to lie within the high - ionization zone of the blr with @xmath62 . for the brightest @xmath0-ray object in our sample , 3c 454.3 , with its accretion luminosity of about @xmath63 erg s@xmath17 @xcite",
    ", the high - ionization zone should be within about 0.1 pc .",
    "this corresponds to about @xmath64 schwarzschild radii for an @xmath65 central black hole @xcite . at such a distance",
    ", the luminosity in the 50 ev complex can be as small as @xmath210@xmath66 erg s@xmath17 , a per mille of the accretion luminosity , to provide the necessary opacity with @xmath67 ( see equation [ eq : taut ] ) .",
    "the opacity measured above 20 gev and the ly@xmath1 luminosity of 10@xmath68 erg s@xmath17 observed in 3c 454.3 @xcite allow us to estimate the ly@xmath1 emission zone size . taking the recombination continuum luminosity equal to that of ly@xmath1 and using equation ( [ eq : taut ] ) we get @xmath69 pc , which indicates that absorption at these energies happens at a larger distance than absorption by heii photons .",
    "the constraints obtained on the @xmath0-ray emission site imply that the jet is already accelerated to a relativistic velocity within a thousand gravitational radii .",
    "it also strongly constrains the mechanisms for @xmath0-ray production .",
    "the possible sources of soft photons for comptonization in the jet are the accretion disk @xcite and the blr @xcite . as a source of photons ,",
    "the dust emission at 10 pc scale @xcite can not be important .",
    "let us also remark that the gev photons absorbed in the blr produce electron ",
    "positron pairs which , spiraling in the magnetic field , radiate away their energy isotropically .",
    "this emission can not compete with the beamed emission from the jet , but can contribute to the high - energy emission of radio galaxies observed at large angles to the jet axis ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "our interpretation of the gev breaks implies that additional breaks ( depressions ) at 0.30.7 gev produced by the soft x - ray lines within the high - ionization zone should be seen , once the photon statistics is high enough .",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectroscopy can be used as a powerful tool for studying the extreme - uv and soft x - ray emission in the quasars vicinity , which is otherwise hidden from us by interstellar absorption .",
    "this research was supported by the academy of finland grants 127512 and 133179 and the visl foundation .",
