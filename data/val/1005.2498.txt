    "arguably , one of the most intriguing aspects of particle physics is the origin of fermion masses . despite the impressive phenomenological success of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , a clear understanding of the fermion mass spectrum is still missing .",
    "the higgs mechanism alone does not provide any explanation for the observed huge hierarchy in the fermion masses , that , not including the neutrino sector , ranges over 6 orders of magnitude .",
    "the higgs yukawa couplings , responsible for fermion - mass generation in the sm , are put in by hand , and tuned with the corresponding fermion masses times the inverse of the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "it is a matter of fact that , out of 19 free parameters of the sm , 13 belong to the yukawa sector .",
    "this suggests that some new physics beyond the sm might be responsible for fermion masses and/or the flavor structure in the yukawa couplings .",
    "many extensions of the sm have been proposed to solve this puzzle , but none of them can be considered as conclusive .",
    "a nonzero fermion mass explicitly breaks the chiral symmetry , and therefore the electroweak ( ew ) gauge symmetry @xmath0 .",
    "however , while the ew gauge symmetry breaking is needed for giving masses to the weak - gauge bosons , its mechanism could be different from the one responsible for the generation of fermion masses . in the sm",
    "there is only one mass scale : the vacuum expectation value @xmath7 of the higgs fields ( @xmath8 gev ) , which sets masses for both fermions and gauge bosons . on the other hand ,",
    "the fermion mass generation scale could in principle be different from the ew symmetry breaking scale @xcite .    once the higgs boson is discovered at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) , the analysis of its decay modes and production processes will help to unravel the mechanisms for both ew symmetry breaking and fermion mass generation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "direct higgs boson searches at cern lep have excluded higgs masses up to 114.4 gev at 95% c.l.@xcite , while the tevatron at fermilab has recently ruled out the mass range 163 gev@xmath9 gev at 95%c.l .",
    "@xcite . moreover , indirect constraints on the higgs boson mass and couplings come from the analysis of its virtual contributions to the ew processes",
    ". these contributions are not extremely sensitive to the higgs boson mass , since , due to the decoupling theorem , one - loop radiative corrections depend only logarithmically on the higgs mass . nevertheless , electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) point to a higgs mass quite close to the lep2 direct bound of 114.4 gev . in particular",
    ", one gets an upper limit @xmath10 157 gev at 95% c.l . , that can be relaxed up to @xmath10 186 gev , if combined with the direct limit @xmath11 gev @xcite .    on the contrary , present ewpt",
    "do not really constrain yukawa couplings .",
    "in fact , radiative corrections induced by yukawa couplings of light fermions are tiny in the sm . also , the sm yukawa coupling contribution to the @xmath12 vertex is by far too small to be tested .",
    "the effects of the top - quark yukawa corrections could be potentially large .",
    "on the other hand , in processes with external light quarks or leptons , they enter only at two loops , which is beyond the present experimental sensitivity .",
    "flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) processes generated at one loop in the sm are an excellent probe of the fermion mass - matrix structure , but they are weakly affected by the yukawa corrections , too .",
    "the latter enter at the two - loop level , since no higgs - boson exchange is needed at one loop to cancel the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergencies . even though fermion masses were put in by hand in the sm lagrangian , due to the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani mechanism @xcite",
    ", the fcnc processes would turn out to be finite at one loop with no need of higgs - boson exchange between fermions .    by the way , even gauge - couplings unification in grand unified theories ( gut ) is weakly affected by yukawa radiative corrections , since their contribution enters at the two - loop level in the renormalization group ( rg ) equations of gauge - couplings @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", the fact that present experimental data do not significantly constrain yukawa couplings still leaves room to speculations on the higgs couplings to fermions , and eventually on the origin of fermion masses .    following these considerations",
    ", we will explore the possibility that there is indeed a light higgs boson that is mainly responsible for the ew symmetry breaking , but the chiral - symmetry breaking ( chsb ) has a different origin .",
    "in particular , the conjecture explored in the present paper is the one where the ( unavoidable ) contribution of chsb to the gauge boson masses is negligible with respect to the contribution provided by the higgs boson .",
    "we will also assume that all the new physics effects responsible for the fermion mass generation can be reabsorbed in the nonvanishing fermion masses plus the renormalization conditions of the yukawa couplings at a large energy scale @xmath1 .",
    "in order to implement the decoupling of the higgs boson to standard fermions , we define @xmath1 as the renormalization scale where the renormalized yukawa couplings vanish . in general",
    ", @xmath1 might not necessarily coincide with the scale of fermion mass generation . + we will also conservatively assume that potential new heavy degrees of freedom will not significantly affect the running of gauge and ( effective ) higgs yukawa couplings at high energies .",
    "hence , from the ew scale up to the @xmath1 scale , the sm can be regarded as an effective field theory , where the fermion mass terms explicitly break the su(2)@xmath13 gauge symmetry .",
    "because of the presence of fermion mass terms , the decoupling of the higgs boson from fermions is spoilt at energy scales different from @xmath1 .",
    "because of the breaking of chiral symmetry , yukawa couplings are not protected against radiative corrections , and effective yukawa couplings will be radiatively induced at low energies .    in this article , we will evaluate the effective yukawa couplings at energies lower than @xmath1 , by the techniques of rg equations .",
    "this will allow us to resum the leading logarithmic terms @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 are the sm gauge couplings ) , at any order in perturbation theory .",
    "we will explicitly check that contributions from higher - dimensional operators , that could spoil the validity of perturbation theory in the yukawa sector , are well under control for any value of @xmath1 up to the gut scale ( @xmath16gev ) , provided the higgs mass is not much larger than the ew scale  @xmath7 .",
    "a critical discussion on the validity of our approach for large values of @xmath1 will be provided in the next sections . in our analysis",
    "we will set the upper value of @xmath1 at the gut scale , which guarantees the perturbativity of the yukawa sector in all the @xmath1 range for @xmath17 .",
    "nevertheless , the existing models that could provide a specific uv completion to our effective theory are in general characterized by a @xmath1 scale much lower than @xmath16 gev .",
    "the present model differs substantially from the fermiophobic higgs boson scenario , appearing in several extensions of the sm @xcite .",
    "indeed , we will see that the higgs boson decay rate into @xmath2 can be strongly enhanced at low energy , depending on the size of @xmath1 .",
    "in the fermiophobic higgs scenario , the higgs couplings to fermions are set to zero at the ew scale @xmath18 .",
    "this condition can naturally arise within new physics models where the scale @xmath1 is not far from the ew scale .",
    "in our approach , when @xmath19 , all the leading - log terms @xmath20 , as well as the renormalization effects on the yukawa couplings at the ew scale , vanish .",
    "one then smoothly recovers the fermiophobic higgs model .",
    "note that the suppression of the top yukawa coupling in the present approach somewhat relieves the sm hierarchical problem in the one - loop radiative corrections to the higgs mass ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , where the dominant contribution to the quadratic cut - off dependence is now the one of order @xmath21 instead of @xmath22 .",
    "a straightforward way to test our scenario for @xmath23 gev is through the measurement of higgs boson decay and production rates at colliders .",
    "the vanishing of the top - quark yukawa coupling at tree - level has a dramatic impact on the higgs boson production at hadron colliders .",
    "the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) @xcite will replace the gluon fusion via the top - quark loop @xcite as the main production mechanism at the lhc .",
    "if the higgs boson is quite light , as suggested by ewpt , the dominant higgs decays channels will be into @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( where one of the weak gauge bosons , or both , can be off - shell ) , and @xmath26 .",
    "the rate for @xmath27 will turn out to be comparable to the @xmath28 rate at @xmath2910 tev , while it increases at larger @xmath1 s . furthermore , the enhanced branching ratio br(@xmath28 ) makes the @xmath4 associated production with @xmath28 a remarkably interesting channel that could be studied for inclusive @xmath30 decays .",
    "present direct experimental limits on @xmath31 crucially depend on the sm yukawa coupling assumption .",
    "bounds on @xmath31 in the purely fermiophobic higgs scenario have been obtained at lep , where one finds @xmath32 109.7 gev at 95% c.l .",

    "in this section , we will derive the rg equations for the effective yukawa couplings arising from the conjecture that the standard higgs mechanism provides masses to the weak gauge - bosons at the ew scale , while fermion masses are not generated by yukawa couplings as in the sm framework .",
    "we will assume that from the ew scale up to some larger energy scale , only sm degrees of freedom are relevant , and fermion masses are put in by hand . since by switching off the sm tree - level couplings of the higgs - boson to fermions , the sm becomes nonrenormalizable , we should consider it as an effective field theory valid up to some high - energy scale .",

    "<S> if @xmath1 is the renormalization scale where the renormalized yukawa couplings vanish , then at energies lower than @xmath1 , effective yukawa couplings will be radiatively induced by nonzero fermion masses . in this scenario </S>",
