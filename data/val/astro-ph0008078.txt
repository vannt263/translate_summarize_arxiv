    "searches for extrasolar planets are being carried out using several methods .",
    "more than 60 planets have been discovered by the doppler - shift technique ( marcy , cochran , & mayor 2000 ) .",
    "while ground - based astrometric searches have not yielded any definitive detections , future astrometric satellites are expected to radically improve the sensitivity of this technique ( lattanzi et al .",
    "the occultation method has yielded an important null result for planets in 47 tuc ( gilliland et al .",
    "2000 ) , and one confirmation ( charbonneau et al .  2000 ; henry et al .",
    "all of these methods are fundamentally restricted to planets with orbital times shorter than the experiment , and hence to relatively close ( and also generally massive ) companions .",
    "microlensing provides a method to search for planets ( mao & paczyski 1991 ) that does not suffer from this limitation .",
    "when two stars are approximately aligned with an observer , the nearer star ( the `` lens '' ) splits the light from the more distant star ( the `` source '' ) into two images whose brightnesses change as the relative alignment changes . the characteristic angular scale , @xmath3 ( `` einstein ring '' ) , and timescale , @xmath4 , of such a microlensing event are @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the mass of the lens , @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the lens - source relative parallax , and @xmath9 is the relative proper motion .",
    "note that @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the lens and source distances . for typical events seen toward the galactic bulge , @xmath13 , which is too small to resolve directly .",
    "however , since the images are magnified , the event can be identified photometrically . for typical bulge events , @xmath14 ,",
    "so @xmath15days , and hence nightly monitoring is sufficient to find most events .",
    "four groups , ogle , macho , eros , and moa have carried out such microlensing searches and combined have detected over 700 events , most in the direction of the galactic bulge ( udalski et al .",
    "2000 ; alcock et al .  1997 ; abe et al .",
    "all four teams recognize these events in real time and electronically alert the community soon after the onset of the event .    if the lens has a planet that lies close to one of the lensed images of the source , that image is further perturbed and the magnification changes significantly during a time @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the mass of the planet .",
    "hence a planet betrays itself as a short ( @xmath19day ) `` bump '' on an otherwise normal single - lens light curve ( refsdal 1964 ; paczyski 1986 ) .",
    "gould & loeb ( 1992 ) showed that , with photometric precision of about 1 - 2% , jupiter - mass planets present a reasonable probability for detection throughout a wide zone centered on the einstein ring .",
    "for typical lens distances @xmath20 , this sensitivity peaks at projected separations @xmath21 . since @xmath16 is of order or shorter than the sampling time of the microlensing search teams , gould & loeb ( 1992 ) advocated setting up a globe - straddling network of observatories to do continuous follow - up observations of alerted events .",
    "the planet collaboration was formed in 1995 ( albrow et al.1996 ) expressly to carry out such observations and demonstrated in that pilot year that the program was feasible ( albrow et al .",
    "planet obtained substantial observing time at four southern locations ( tasmania , western australia , south africa , and chile ) during 1995 - 99 . during these five years",
    ", we monitored @xmath22 microlensing events sufficiently well to have good to excellent sensitivity to planets , none of which displayed a clear photometric anomaly that was best explained by a planet orbiting the lens .",
    "we quantify this statement by characterizing the statistical sensitivity of our five - year data set to planets .",
    "we then use these results to build mass - separation exclusion diagrams for the typical galactic stars ( i.e. , microlenses ) that our survey probes .",
    "the basic method of analysis is given in gaudi & sackett ( 2000 ) and applied to event ogle  1998-bul-14 in albrow et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "the details of its application to the present data set are given by albrow et al .",
    "our data were acquired over five years from six telescopes : the canopus 1 m near hobart , tasmania , the perth / lowell 0.6 m at bickley , australia , the elizabeth 1 m at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) at sutherland , south africa , the eso / dutch 0.9 m at la silla , chile , the yale 1 m and the ctio 0.9 m at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory ( ctio ) at la serena , chile .",
    "data were collected in cousins @xmath23 and johnson @xmath24 , with strong emphasis on the former .",
    "the bulk of events analyzed here have median sampling times of 1 to 2 hours , or @xmath25 .",
    "observations from four observatories permit round - the - clock monitoring of events ; the best events rarely have gaps in the data longer than a day . for such events , the typical photometric precision ( as judged by the scatter )",
    "is of order 12% for points near the peak , which contain most of the sensitivity to planets .",
    "the dataset contains 5 - 6 high - magnification events with well - sampled peaks .",
    "these events contribute at least 1/2 of our overall sensitivity .",
    "for the final event sample , the median number of photometric points within @xmath26 of the peak magnification is about 140 , with @xmath27 of events having more than 65 points and @xmath28 having more than 250 points within @xmath26 of the peak .",
    "details are given in albrow et al .",
    "we begin with the complete sample of galactic bulge events monitored by planet during 1995 - 1999 , discarding those of extremely poor quality and those known to contain anomalies characteristic of roughly equal - mass binaries or other anomalies unrelated to binarity .",
    "normal point - source / point - lens ( pspl ) microlensing events are described by @xmath29 @xmath30= { u^2 + 2\\over u(u^2 + 4)^{1/2}},\\ ] ] @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the observed flux , @xmath33 is the source flux , @xmath34 is the flux from any background light that is not magnified , @xmath35 is the projected source - lens impact parameter , and @xmath36 is the time of closest approach .",
    "separate @xmath33 and @xmath34 are required for each observatory and wave band .",
    "non - planetary light curve anomalies are identified through explicit modeling .",
    "we discard such anomalous light curves from our analysis because we do not currently have the ability to systematically search for planetary signatures in the presence of these secondary effects .",
    "we note , however , that none of the excluded light curves show signs of short duration bumps , except macho  97-blg-41 for which the deviation is explained naturally by binary rotation ( albrow et al .",
    "2000a ) rather than a planet orbiting a binary ( bennett et al .",
    "1999 ) .    to eliminate events of particularly poor quality for planet detection , we introduce event selection criteria : 1 ) all data must pass certain quality tests : only dophot ( schechter , mateo , & saha 1993 ) types 11 and 13 are accepted .",
    "2 ) there must be at least 20 data points from at least one observatory in one band .",
    "3 ) each observatory - band dataset included must contain at least 10 data points .",
    "4 ) the error in @xmath35 from a combined fit must be less than 50% .",
    "if @xmath35 is not well constrained , then the source s path through the einstein ring is not well determined , and hence it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of the event to planets .",
    "when available , we use ogle and macho data to help constrain @xmath35 , but not to search for planets .",
    "our final sample includes a total of 43 events .",
    "a full list of these events along with the photometric data is presented in albrow et al .",
    "the method of measuring the sensitivity of an event to the presence of planets , and at the same time searching for planetary signatures if they are present , is thoroughly described in albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . very briefly",
    ", we obtain a pspl fit using equation ( [ eqn : foft ] ) , and simultaneously renormalize the photometric errors at each observatory so that the total @xmath37 of this fit is equal to the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "note that outliers are not included for error renormalization , but are included when searching for planets .",
    "we also include in all model fits a term that accounts for the correlation of the photometry with the seeing that we observe in most of our light curves ( both microlensed and constant stars ) .",
    "although these procedures do bias us against binaries , the bias is only serious if all the points from one observatory are concentrated in a short span of the light curve and there are no contemporaneous data from other observatories . from direct inspection of the 43 lightcurves in our event sample",
    "we find that such bunching affects @xmath38 of our total lightcurve coverage , which leads to an overestimate of our detection efficiency of a similar magnitude .",
    "since this bias is an order of magnitude smaller than our statistical errors , we ignore it . on the other hand , monte carlo experiments with constant stars reveal that error renormalization and removal of systematic effects are essential in order to draw reliable inferences from the light curves and to avoid spurious detections .",
    "see albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for details and a thorough discussion .    for each planet - star mass ratio @xmath39 and each planet - star projected separation @xmath40 , as well as each angle @xmath41 of the source trajectory relative to the binary axis , we find the best fit to the remaining parameters @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath43 thus yields @xmath44 , for which we set a threshold value @xmath45 . if @xmath46 , then the geometry @xmath47 is excluded .",
    "if @xmath48 , we tentatively conclude that we have detected a planet .",
    "the detection efficiency @xmath49 for planets with this @xmath50 in event @xmath51 is then just the fraction of all angles @xmath41 ( out of @xmath52 ) that are excluded .",
    "we define a `` planetary system '' as a binary lens with mass ratio @xmath53 .",
    "exclusion diagram for pairs of planet parameters @xmath50 , where @xmath54 is the projected separation in units of the einstein ring , and @xmath39 is the planet - star mass ratio .",
    "the inner contour indicates the @xmath50 for which the fraction of lenses with a planet is @xmath55 at 95% confidence .",
    "other contours are for @xmath56 , 1/2 , 2/3 , and 3/4 .",
    "a mass ratio @xmath57 corresponds approximately to @xmath58 , and a projected separation of @xmath59 corresponds to a physical projected separation @xmath60au .",
    "we have assumed a detection threshold of @xmath61 .",
    "we set the threshold @xmath45 by first noting the continuous distribution of @xmath62 in our data .",
    "if a significant fraction of these were due to planets , the distribution would extend to much more extreme values , since a small random change in the impact parameter could easily increase @xmath63 to several hundred .",
    "hence , the great majority of these deviations must be due to small unrecognized systematic errors .",
    "monte carlo tests performed with constant stars reveals that deviations of @xmath64 are easily explained by systematic and statistical noise .",
    "we therefore set the threshold high enough to exclude these non - planetary sources of noise .",
    "we also show results for the more conservative threshold @xmath65 .",
    "exclusion diagram for planets anywhere in a continuous range of semi - major axes centered on the einstein ring .",
    "bold curves show the excluded fraction ( at 95% confidence ) anywhere in the range @xmath66au , while solid curves show the fraction for @xmath67au . we have assumed a detection threshold of @xmath61 , and that the primary has an einstein ring radius @xmath68 . for other einstein ring radii ,",
    "the separations scale as @xmath69 .",
    "the dashed curves show the negligible effect of including the finite size of the source in the modeling .",
    "the dotted lines are for @xmath65 .",
    "this search procedure identifies two possible candidates , but these are also representatives of two classes of phenomena that must be excluded from our search : nearly equal - mass binary lenses and global - asymmetry anomalies .",
    "macho  99-blg-18 has a @xmath70day anomaly of amplitude @xmath71 . such an anomaly is longer than that expected from planets with @xmath72 , and we therefore systematically explored binary - lens fits with @xmath73 .",
    "this uncovered a fit with @xmath74 that is favored over the best - fit planet ( @xmath75 ) by @xmath76 .",
    "we therefore exclude macho  99-blg-18 from the analysis .",
    "although @xmath76 is below our normal threshold ( @xmath77 ) , we estimate that the probability that we have inadvertently thrown out a real planetary detection that is @xmath78 , smaller than the statistical errors on our resultant limit on planetary companions .",
    "see albrow et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) for a discussion .",
    "ogle  99-bul-36 displays an overall asymmetry that is consistent with a distortion caused by a @xmath79 planet .",
    "such parallax asymmetries are a general feature of parallax which must be present at some level in all microlensing events ( gould , miralde - escud & bahcall 1994 ) .",
    "indeed , this distortion is equally well - fit by such a parallax asymmetry model . given that ogle  99-bul-36 has a relatively short timescale ( @xmath80 )",
    ", one might naively expect the parallax interpretation to be unlikely .",
    "however , the magnitude of the parallax asymmetry is quite small , and only detectable due to the high quality of the data .",
    "the resulting asymmetry implies reasonable values for the most probable mass and distance to the lens .",
    "we conclude that we can not reliably detect planets from global asymmetries , and should exclude from our analysis all events that display such anomalies and reduce our efficiency estimates accordingly .",
    "although we do not explicitly do this , this results in detection efficiencies that are overestimated by a negligible amount , since a very special planetary geometry is required to produce a global asymmetry ( rather than a short duration anomaly ) .",
    "this conclusion is borne out by explicit simulations ( albrow et  al .",
    "thus there are no viable planet candidates out of our original sample of 43 events .",
    "from the above analysis of each event @xmath51 , we obtain an efficiency @xmath49 as a function of planetary geometry @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the fraction of lenses having a planet at @xmath50 .",
    "then , from binomial statistics , the probability of observing no planets is @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "note that in the limit @xmath83 ( approximately valid in the present study ) , this reduces to the poisson formula @xmath84 $ ] , where @xmath85 is the expected number of detections .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , fractions @xmath86 can be rejected at 95% confidence .",
    "based on this analysis , we build an exclusion diagram ( fig.1 ) based on the sample of 42 events ( excluding macho-99-blg-18 ) for planet parameters @xmath50 . to convert @xmath54 and @xmath39 into physical parameters of planet mass @xmath18 and projected physical separation @xmath87",
    ", we must estimate the typical mass @xmath6 and physical einstein radius @xmath88 for the events in our sample .",
    "the majority of detected microlensing events are almost certainly bulge stars lensing other bulge stars ( kiraga & paczyski 1994 ) . if the lenses were drawn randomly from the bulge mass function as measured by zoccali et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , one would expect the typical mass to be @xmath89 and hence the typical timescale to be @xmath90days .",
    "however , the median timescale for our sample is 40 days .",
    "the difference is probably mainly due to a bias in our selection process . from equation ( [ eqn : thetaedef ] ) ,",
    "a bias toward large @xmath4 will cause biases toward higher @xmath6 , higher @xmath8 , and lower @xmath9 . comparing figures",
    "1a and 1b from gould ( 2000 ) , we infer that most of the dispersion in observed timescales is due to @xmath9 and @xmath8 , so the bias in terms of mass is likely to be modest .",
    "hence , we adopt @xmath91 and @xmath92as , and thus @xmath93as . with our convention @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96au .    in figure 2 we present upper limits for the fraction of lenses with planets over two ranges of semi - major axes @xmath97 centered on the einstein ring .",
    "to convert from projected separation ( fig.1 ) to semi - major axis , we integrate over all orientations assuming circular orbits , @xmath98 and @xmath99au .",
    "we calculate efficiencies using both the point - source approximation and allowing for finite source size ( gaudi & sackett 2000 ) but find that the difference is negligible .",
    "we find that less than 1/3 of lenses have jupiter - mass companions anywhere in the range of @xmath100au .",
    "these are the first significant limits on planetary companions of m dwarfs .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for helping to clarify a number of important points .",
    "we thank the eros , macho , and ogle collaboration for providing the original electronic microlensing event alerts that are the sine qua non of this work , and the macho and ogle collaborations for providing their original data for many of the events .",
    "we are especially grateful to the observatories that support our science ( canopus , ctio , eso , perth , saao , yale ) via the generous allocations of time that make this work possible , and to those who have donated their time to observe for this program .",
