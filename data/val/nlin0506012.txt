    "propagation of the light through spatially nonlocal media is one of main subjects in modern nonlinear optics@xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown , both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite , that highly nonlocal kerr - type media supports propagation of stable laser beams , usually referred to as `` solitons '' .",
    "laser beams propagating in kerr - type media are modelled by the celebrated ( @xmath0)d nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation . unlike ( @xmath1)d nls equation",
    ", it is not integrable by inverse scattering method@xcite . in the case of high nonlocal media , ( 2 + 1)d",
    "nls equation can be approximated by quantum harmonic oscillator ( qho ) equation . using results concerning qho in the optics context , it has been possible to show the existence of solitons@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , a complete understanding of the rle played by spatial nonlocal effects in the propagation of radiation in nonlinear media is still an open problem .",
    "hence , it is of interest to investigate possible integrable regimes for three - dimensional nonlinear models .    in the present paper ,",
    "we propose the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger - type ( nnls ) equation as the model to describe a beam propagating in a medium with a certain spatial nonlocality degree and obeying some intensity law . by `` intensity law '' we mean certain functional dependence among dielectric function and intensity of the beam .",
    "we study the high frequency limit under specific assumptions , namely , the cole - cole dispersion law for the medium and suitably slow variation of the fields along propagating direction . separating behaviors on the transverse and propagating directions ,",
    "we derive two couples of equations for the phase and the intensity . due to the intensity law ,",
    "phase and intensity equations are strongly coupled and their compatibility appears to be a highly nontrivial problem .",
    "as far as phase equations concerned , the compatibility has been studied in the papers  [ ] .",
    "it has been shown that compatibility condition corresponds to the request that refractive index satisfies an infinite set of integrable equations referred to as dispersionless veselov - novikov ( dvn ) hierarchy .",
    "in particular , degrees of spatial nonlocality are in one - to - one correspondence with the orders of equations of dvn hierarchy .",
    "so , we study compatibility among phase and intensity equations for certain assigned intensity law .",
    "we focus first on transverse equations .",
    "their compatibility leads us to the study of a second order nonlinear partial differential equation . since for most of physical models",
    "it satisfies the ellipticity condition we restrict ourselves to the class of so - called _ elliptic intensity laws_.    the use of known results in the theory of elliptic equations and the special properties of beltrami equation allows us to conclude that , for a generic elliptic intensity law , there exists singular wavefronts which can be used to describe self - guided beams .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that harmonic minimal surfaces provide us with a class of wavefronts for any elliptic intensity law . as explicit examples ,",
    "helicoidal wavefronts are discussed .",
    "we stress that the helicoid is a well known example of singular wavefront which possesses several interesting properties@xcite .",
    "we show that helicoidal wavefronts are preserved for a specific class of first degree nonlocal perturbations up to next - to - leading order contributions .",
    "we present a simple example where the first degree nonlocality is responsible of a slight stretching or compression of the helicoid s pitch .",
    "general problem of compatibility among equations for transverse and propagating direction is difficult as much as crucial . in our model",
    "the consideration of propagating direction contributions is equivalent to inclusion of nonlocal terms . besides",
    ", in the local case , equations for propagating direction are automatically compatible for any intensity law and it is sufficient to consider the transverse equations . we demonstrate that there exists a class of solutions for the third degree nonlocality which are in agreement with a suitable intensity law . exploiting hydrodynamic - type reductions , found in the paper  [ ] , we present some explicit formulae .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec_nnls ] derivation of nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger equation is presented . in the section  [ sec_go ]",
    "phase equations and high frequency limit of poynting vector conservation law in a cole - cole medium are displayed .",
    "a study of compatibility among intensity law and transverse equations and properties of solutions is presented in the section  [ sec_transverse ] .",
    "compatibility of intensity law and nonlocal perturbations is illustrated in section  [ sec_symmmetry ] by an explicit example .",
    "some concluding remarks close the paper .",
    "let us consider the nonlinear maxwell equations @xmath2 where the displacement vector @xmath3 depends nonlinearly on the electric field .",
    "we look for time - oscillating solutions such that @xmath4 under these assumptions one gets the following second order equation@xcite @xmath5 displacement vector @xmath6 is chosen in a way to collect both nonlinear and nonlocal effects , i.e. @xmath7 first term of the r.h.s . contains the nonlinearity .",
    "dielectric function @xmath8 is assumed to contain a weakly nonlinear perturbation of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 depends on the intensity of the radiation .",
    "the second term in the r.h.s . of  ( [ displacement ] ) provides us with the spatial nonlocal response of the medium .",
    "we assume it to be of the form @xmath11 one gets the expression  ( [ nonlocal_term ] ) for the nonlocal term considering an integral relation among the displacement and the electric field where the kernel is a sum of @xmath12-functions and spatial derivatives .",
    "we define the degree of nonlocality as the maximum derivative order which appears in expression  ( [ nonlocal_term ] ) .",
    "paraxial approximation is performed according to the rule ( see e.g. ref .  )",
    "@xmath13 ( setting vacuum light speed @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , and the amplitudes are assumed to depend slowly on the coordinates in such a way that the gradient acts as follows @xmath16 using the expression  ( [ displacement ] ) and the rules  ( [ rule_paraxial ] ) and  ( [ rule_gradient ] ) in the second order equation  ( [ maxwell_second ] ) , one shows that the first nontrivial contribution is of the order @xmath17 and it provides us with the nonlocal nonlinear schrdinger - type ( nnls ) equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 note that in absence of nonlocal contribution @xmath20 and for a kerr type nonlinear response of the medium , equation  ( [ nnls ] ) becomes the standard nonlinear schrdinger equation in @xmath21dimensions .",
    "in this section we study the geometrical optics limit of nnls equation for a medium which satisfies so - called cole - cole dispersion law@xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the relaxation time and @xmath24 is a suitable phenomenological exponent whose range of values is of crucial importance in the following derivations .",
    "relation  ( [ colecole ] ) describes frequency dependence of dielectric function for several polar media as well as liquid crystals and various biological tissues ( see e.g. refs .  [ ] ) .",
    "we study a particular high frequency regime of nnls equation where the phase of electric field varies slowly along @xmath25-direction in such a way that @xmath26    we also assume nonlocal effects to be weak in high frequency limit in such a way that they contribute at most with @xmath27order terms @xmath28 in order to calculate geometrical optics limit we adopt , as usual , the following representation of electric field @xmath29 expansion of all functions with respect to small parameter @xmath30 @xmath31 together with dispersion law  ( [ colecole ] ) and the prescriptions  ( [ slowder ] ) leads us to the high frequency limit of nnls equation at the orders @xmath32 and @xmath33 :    [ phase ] @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 . for convenience we denote the partial derivative of a function @xmath37 with respect to variable @xmath38 as @xmath39 .",
    "we stress that condition on the exponent @xmath40 is crucial to separate equation  ( [ z_dependence ] ) from polarization contributions .",
    "equation  ( [ eikonal ] ) is the standard eikonal equation in two - dimensions while the function @xmath41 in equation  ( [ z_dependence ] ) is an @xmath42-degree polynomial in @xmath43 and @xmath44 and it describes an @xmath42-degree nonlocal response .",
    "moreover , in agreement with inversion phase symmetry ( @xmath45 ) of the eikonal equation , polynomial degree of function @xmath41 must be odd .",
    "we note also that the system of equations  ( [ phase ] ) has been derived first directly from the maxwell equations@xcite . in the present paper , we will consider local response and first and third degree nonlocal responses .",
    "in local case we have @xmath46 where @xmath41 and @xmath47 are certain function of their arguments .",
    "for a first degree nonlocality we have @xmath48 and @xmath47 must satisfy the following linear equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are harmonic conjugate functions ( they satisfy cauchy - riemann conditions @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . finally , for a third degree nonlocal response we have @xmath54 and @xmath47 satisfies the dispersionless veselov - novikov equation @xmath55    in order to complete geometrical optics description we construct high frequency limit of poynting vector conservation law @xmath56 poynting vector can be written down as follows @xmath57 is the total phase of electric field and @xmath58 is the intensity . in the following , for sake of simplicity , we set dielectric constant @xmath59 . using the previous prescriptions to perform high frequency limit in paraxial approximation and expanding intensity @xmath60",
    "one concludes that equation  ( [ poynting ] ) leads to the following set of equations for @xmath61 and @xmath62    [ intensity ] @xmath63    in this regime , properties of the light are completely described by the systems of equations  ( [ phase ] ) and  ( [ intensity ] ) . if no additional conditions are considered , once compatibility of equations  ( [ phase ] ) is guaranteed , linear system  ( [ intensity ] ) provides us with leading orders intensity contributions @xmath61 and @xmath62",
    ".    integrability of the phase equations  ( [ phase ] ) has been discussed in details in refs .",
    "[ ] . in particular , it has been shown that for a function @xmath41 with a polynomial dependence on @xmath43 and @xmath44 , compatibility condition of equations  ( [ phase ] ) selects the class of refractive indices which satisfy the dispersionless limit of the veselov - novikov ( dvn ) hierarchy .",
    "in particular , dvn hierarchy allows us to classify different degrees of nonlocal response by a one - to - one correspondence among degrees of the polynomials @xmath41 and the equations of the hierarchy .",
    "we mention that dvn hierarchy is amenable by the quasiclassical @xmath64-dressing method@xcite and a reduction method based on symmetry constraints appears to be an effective method to construct exact solutions@xcite .",
    "several models in nonlinear optics analyze a self - action of the medium assuming that the influence of an external electromagnetic field is described by a functional dependence among intensity and refractive index @xmath65 .",
    "this is the form of intensity law in the geometrical optics limit .",
    "kerr type media , where @xmath66 , and saturable nonlinear media such that @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the so - called threshold intensity , are two famous examples .",
    "of course , for self - action nonlinear media models phase equations  ( [ phase ] ) and intensity equations  ( [ intensity ] ) appear to be strongly coupled and the study of their compatibility is a highly non - trivial problem . in the present section ,",
    "we analyze compatibility and properties of equations  ( [ eikonal ] ) and  ( [ i0 ] ) , here referred to as transverse equations .",
    "we note that this analysis is quite trivial in the case of the media exhibiting local response . indeed , according to relations  ( [ local_hp ] ) @xmath47 does not depend on the @xmath25-variable . then , equation  ( [ i1 ] ) coincides with equation  ( [ i0 ] ) and they are automatically compatible with  ( [ z_dependence ] ) .",
    "let us consider a self - action nonlinear medium obeying intensity law @xmath69 . observing that @xmath70 , where `` prime '' means the derivative with respect its argument @xmath47 , and using equation  ( [ eikonal ] ) in  ( [ i0 ] ) , one gets the following second order partial differential equation @xmath71 where by definition @xmath72 and @xmath73 recall that properties of a second order partial differential equation depend critically on the discriminant @xmath74 if @xmath75",

    "indeed , one can simply verify that for a kerr - type intensity law of the form @xmath79 where @xmath80 and a logarithmic one , @xmath81 , one has @xmath82 uniformly .",
    "ellipticity of equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) seems to be associated to important physical properties of a wide class of nonlinear media .",
    "moreover , elliptic equations such as  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) have been well studied in mathematics and possess several remarkable analytical and geometrical properties@xcite .",
    "now , we will study equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) . introducing complex variable @xmath83 and the complex gradient @xmath84 , one can rewrite equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) equivalently as follows @xmath85 where @xmath86 a class of solutions of equation  ( [ s_elliptic_complex ] )",

    "beltrami equation describes so - called quasiconformal mapping of the plane of complex dilatation @xmath90@xcite .",
    "this fact highlights an intriguing connection among geometrical optics and quasiconformal mapping theory .",
    "for instance , let us consider a laser beam whose input profile is @xmath91 inside a simply connected domain @xmath92 and @xmath93 on the smooth boundary @xmath94 of @xmath92 and outside it . because of functional relation @xmath69 , refractive index is constant on @xmath94 too .",

    "it could be interesting to note that if @xmath105 `` evolves '' along @xmath25 according to equation  ( [ z_dependence ] ) and this evolution is compatible with equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) , inverse mapping ( it exists since @xmath99 is homeomorphic ) @xmath106 , with @xmath107 , provides us with the beam profile at any @xmath25 .",
    "mapping @xmath108 can be also regarded as a two - dimensional vector field on the @xmath109plane associated with transverse components of the wavefront normal unit vector . in the case",
    "@xmath110 , it is has the simple form @xmath111 from this point of view , mapping @xmath99 gives us information about light - rays distribution around propagating direction .",
    "as specific example , let us consider a mapping as in figure  [ figure1]a .",
    "curves @xmath94 and @xmath112 are oriented leaving domain on the right hand side . under conditions mentioned above ,",
    "there exists a homeomorphism @xmath99 of domain @xmath92 onto @xmath113 acting in such a way that @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",

    "this mapping allows the radiation to be ` self - guided ' around propagating direction .",
    "conversely , if @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 radiation spreads transversely far from @xmath122axis .",
    "note that in both cases homeomorphism @xmath99 is sense - reversing . if we consider a sense - preserving mapping such as , for instance , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 , the beam spreads along @xmath126direction and tends to be trapped along @xmath127axis ( see figure  [ figure1]b ) .",

    "the advantage of the use of the reciprocal transformation is that the beltrami equation is just linear and several properties of the analytic functions can be rigorously generalized to its solutions ( see e.g. ref .",
    "an interesting result is provided by the generalization of liouville theorem . indeed , if @xmath134 is bounded on whole @xmath135plane and satisfies linear beltrami equation  ( [ beltrami_lin ] ) it can be shown ( _ vekua s theorem _ ) that @xmath136@xcite .",
    "of course , for the constant solution , mapping from @xmath135to@xmath137plane is singular and reciprocal transformation  ( [ recip_coordinates ] ) is not defined .",
    "then , any non - trivial solution of equation  ( [ beltrami_lin ] ) must be singular somewhere on the complex plane and different type of singularities can occur , such as poles , essential singularities , singularities of the derivatives etc .",
    "a complete analytical and geometrical classification of them will be done elsewhere  @xcite .    for sake of simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a solution @xmath138 having a simple pole at @xmath139 . as discussed above , one can always consider a homeomorphism from @xmath140 to @xmath141 where @xmath142 is a disk of arbitrarily small radius @xmath143 on the @xmath135plane and @xmath141 is the @xmath144-radius disk on the @xmath109plane , mapping the boundary of @xmath142 on the boundary of @xmath141 .",
    "inverse mapping @xmath145 constructed in such a way can be used to describe a beam `` confined''around @xmath122axis .",
    "indeed , light rays crossing the boundary of @xmath141 can settled down arbitrarily parallel to @xmath122axis as much as disk @xmath142 is small .",
    "coming back to nonlinear beltrami equation  ( [ beltrami_nlin ] ) , we expect that for `` mild enough '' complex dilatations @xmath90 , vekua s theorem still holds . in these cases , the only one bounded solution on whole @xmath109plane is @xmath146 .",
    "in most of meaningful physical situations , intensity distribution on the @xmath109plane , at certain @xmath25 , goes to zero for @xmath147 , or equivalently , one can says that intensity vanishes outside a big enough @xmath148radius disk @xmath141 .",
    "thus , outside @xmath141 , refractive index assumes a constant value @xmath149 and the solutions of eikonal equation  ( [ eikonal ] ) is @xmath150 where @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 are constants and the condition @xmath154 holds . for a paraxial beam",
    "we have @xmath155 . by a consequence @xmath156 and ,",
    "of course it satisfies beltrami equation in @xmath157 . in virtue of vekua s theorem , the only one bounded solution is @xmath158 .",
    "then , any non - trivial solution must be singular somewhere on the plane . in our example ,",
    "wavefront is approximately plane for @xmath159 and possesses singularity inside @xmath141 .",
    "standard approach to calculate solutions of beltrami equation is based on its reduction to a two - dimensional integral equation  @xcite which is amenable by using the successive approximation method .",
    "in general , to find ` explicit ' exact solutions is a quite challenging problem and successful chances are critically depending on the form of the complex dilatation .",
    "incidentally , we note that solutions possessing cylindrical symmetry such that @xmath160 are not compatible with intensity law .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that equations  ( [ eikonal ] ) and  ( [ i0 ] ) along with assumptions  ( [ cylindrical_sol ] ) imply that intensity depends explicitly on @xmath122axis distance @xmath161 @xmath162 where @xmath163 is an arbitrary constant .    here ,",
    "we discuss solution of the equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) in connection with the minimal surfaces .",
    "they are described by the following elliptic equation ( see e.g. ref .  )",
    "@xmath164 now , we restrict ourselves to the class of solutions of equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) which are also harmonic , that is @xmath165 using condition  ( [ harmonic ] ) in equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) , one gets the equation @xmath166 for any intensity law .",
    "it is straightforward to check that equations  ( [ s_elliptic_min ] ) and  ( [ minimal ] ) coincide for harmonic solutions . in other words , a class of solutions of equation  ( [ s_elliptic ] ) , whatever is dependence @xmath167 , is just given by the class of the harmonic minimal surfaces .",
    "an interesting non - trivial example of solution is @xmath168 where @xmath169 is an arbitrary constant .",

    "we stress that singular wavefronts of the form  ( [ helicoid_wavefronts ] ) are well known in the theory of nonlinear singular optics and their topological properties have important phenomenological consequences connected with description of screw wavefront dislocations or so - called optical vortices@xcite ( see also ref .  [ , ] and references therein ) .",
    "note that complex gradient associated with the helicoid @xmath172 is analytic and it has a simple pole singularity at @xmath173 .",
    "nevertheless , normal vector to the wavefront , whose components coincides ( up to a sign ) with real and imaginary parts of @xmath99 , is not defined .",
