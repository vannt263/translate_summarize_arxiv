    "flow without dissipation is the defining feature of superfluidity . because of this property the moment of inertia of a vessel containing a superfluid is different from ( smaller than ) that when the liquid is in the normal state .",
    "this effect is largest in the absence of vortices , when superfluid flow is irrotational .",
    "the difference between the moments of inertia when the liquid , confined by boundary conditions , is in the normal and superfluid states is known as the `` non - classical rotational inertia '' ( ncri ) .",
    "the occurrence of ncri is often used as an experimental signature of superfluidity .",
    "superfluid hydrodynamics and the resulting ncri have been studied extensively  @xcite in the past for simple geometries , such as spherical , cylindrical or rectangular containers rotating about a symmetry axis . because of several recent developments , some of which are briefly discussed below",
    ", it has become necessary to understand the properties of flow of superfluids in enclosures of more complicated geometry .",
    "these provide the motivation for our present study .",
    "recent observations  @xcite of ncri in torsional oscillation experiments on solid @xmath8 have been interpreted as the occurrence of a `` supersolid '' phase .",
    "this interpretation of the experimental results is controversial .",
    "there is experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite evidence suggesting that the observed ncri is due to superfluidity along crystalline defects such as grain boundaries in a polycrystalline sample and networks of dislocation lines .",
    "since these extended defects form complex disordered structures , calculations of the flow properties and the rotational inertia of a superfluid confined in irregular - shaped channels are necessary for a quantitative assessment of whether this mechanism is the correct explanation of the observed results . in this context",
    ", it is important to examine whether the superfluid component can flow along continuous closed paths in the sample .",
    "since the geometry of the network of defects would depend on thermodynamic variables such as temperature and pressure , and on the cell geometry , the availability of such paths would also depend on these parameters and conditions .",
    "thus , an understanding of the dependence of the ncri on such variables requires , for example , a calculation of how the ncri arising from a blocked ring of superfluid changes as the blockage is removed . to check whether the observed ncri is due to the occurrence of extended superfluidity",
    ", the ncri of samples in which the solid @xmath8 is confined in the annular region between two concentric cylinders has been measured  @xcite in the presence of a barrier in the annulus that prevents possible flow of the superfluid along a closed path surrounding the rotation axis ( the common axis of the cylinders ) .",
    "the ncri observed under these conditions is found to be much smaller than that for samples in which the artificial block is not present .",
    "the calculation just mentioned is obviously relevant for a quantitative understanding of the results of such experiments .",
    "finally , an understanding of experimental results  @xcite on the dependence of the ncri on the frequency of torsional oscillations requires a theoretical analysis of vortex formation and critical velocity in superfluids confined in irregular - shaped channels .",
    "our study is also partly motivated by the recent explosion of activity in experimental and theoretical studies of superfluidity and other quantum phenomena in trapped , ultracold atomic systems  @xcite .",
    "also , there have been many experimental studies of the flow properties and ncri of superfluids confined in porous media such as vycor glass and containers packed with fine powder  @xcite .",
    "the first experimental observation  @xcite of `` supersolid '' behavior was in a torsional oscillator experiment on solid @xmath8 confined in vycor glass .",
    "since the pores in these systems have complex geometry , it is necessary to work out the hydrodynamics of superfluids in irregular - shaped channels in order to understand the results of these experiments in quantitative detail .",
    "thus , we study here the hydrodynamics of a superfluid confined in a two - dimensional region between two concentric circular arcs , each of which subtends an angle @xmath3 at their common center .",
    "the annular region between the two arcs is bounded on two sides by straight walls along the radial direction .",
    "thus , the special case with @xmath9 corresponds to a ring that is blocked by a wall placed perpendicular to its inner and outer peripheries .",
    "this two - dimensional geometry corresponds , neglecting edge effects , to that used in many experiments on supersolid behavior in @xmath8 where the helium is confined in the annular region between two concentric cylinders , under the assumption that the cylinders are long enough and the confined system is homogeneous along the cylinder axis . in the limit of vanishing inner radius ,",
    "the geometry we study corresponds to that of a wedge with opening angle @xmath3 .",
    "the limit @xmath9 in this case represents a circular container with a straight blocking wall extending from the center of the circle to its periphery .",
    "we assume throughout the paper that the fluid is incompressible , which is appropriate for superfluid helium .",
    "we first consider the case where there are no vortices ( so that the superfluid flow is irrotational ) , and solve the hydrodynamic equation for the velocity field for rotation about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the system and passing through the common center of the arcs that form its boundary .",
    "the sample geometry is reflected in the boundary conditions for the velocity field . for incompressible and irrotational flow , the velocity field can be expressed in terms of either a scalar or a vector potential ( stream function ) , analogous to those in electromagnetic theory , both of which satisfy the laplace equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the scalar potential method is simpler , and leads to series that converge rapidly .",
    "we have used this method to obtain the velocity field for @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for a general value of @xmath3 , however , the stream function method , although more difficult in that it leads to series that are not convergent , but borel summable , is more powerful . we have therefore used it to obtain the velocity field for arbitrary @xmath3 .",
    "we present analytic results for the velocity field and the moment of inertia for arbitrary values of the inner and outer radii and the opening angle @xmath3 .",
    "we also derive a simple `` parallel axis '' theorem that relates the moment of inertia for rotation about any axis perpendicular to the plane of the system to the calculated value for rotation about an axis passing through the center of mass .    in the context of experimental observations of ncri in solid @xmath8 ,",
    "the most important result of our study is about the ncri of a blocked ring .",
    "when the ring is blocked , the superfluid can not flow through it .",
    "however , due to the irrotational nature of superfluid flow , the moment of inertia is smaller than that for rigid - body rotation .",
    "therefore , the drop in the moment of inertia when the block is removed ( the superfluid does not contribute to the moment of inertia when there is no block ) is less than the rigid - body value .",
    "our calculations show that the moment of inertia of a blocked ring whose width is small compared to its radius is very close to its moment of inertia for rigid rotation , so that unblocking the ring ( i.e. the opening up of a closed path ) produces a large drop in the moment of inertia ( nearly equal to its rigid - rotation value ) , which would show up in an experiment as a relatively large value of the ncri .",
    "thus , the onset of ncri in experiments on solid @xmath8 may correspond to the unblocking of large closed paths in the network of defects along which the superfluid component is supposed to exist .",
    "our results for the ncri of a superfluid confined in a blocked ring can be compared directly with those of experiments  @xcite in which the ncri of solid @xmath8 confined in an annular cell is measured both in the presence and in the absence of a barrier that blocks flow around the annular channel .",
    "we show that our results , when combined with accurate measurements of the ncri , can provide valuable information about the structure of the superfluid network in solid @xmath8 , and discuss the validity of our hydrodynamic description for superfluid flow in narrow channels such as those along crystalline defects in solid @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting new result of our calculation is that the velocity field for a wedge with @xmath7 diverges at the tip of the wedge for _ any _ nonzero value of the angular velocity @xmath12 .",
    "this means that the implicit assumption that the velocity field nowhere exceeds the landau critical velocity is in principle mathematically incorrect for these wedges : for any nonzero value of @xmath12 , there must be a region near the tip where the liquid is in the normal state .",
    "we show that the size of the region where this occurs is too small to have any measurable consequence in @xmath8 experiments performed with usual geometries .",
    "this divergence of the velocity can be removed by the presence of a single vortex .",
    "we calculate the position of this vortex and the rotational inertia in its presence .",
    "our calculations uncover also several interesting mathematical issues and we indicate ways of addressing them . some of these were also present in earlier studies  @xcite of superfluid hydrodynamics , while some are new .",
    "we discuss these questions as they appear throughout the paper .    whether vortices appear or not is in general determined by the free - energy cost of creating a vortex .",
    "we will show that for typical experiments on @xmath8 , vortices do not occur for sufficiently small angular velocities .",
    "however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , states with vortices present will have , at sufficiently larger values of the angular velocity , a lower free energy than the vortex - free state .",
    "we calculate the critical angular velocity for vortex nucleation which turns out , for typical @xmath8 samples , to be in the experimentally important range of angular velocities .",
    "we show how the rotational inertia is modified by these vortex excitations .",
    "these results are relevant for understanding the experimentally observed dependence of the ncri of `` supersolid '' @xmath8 on the frequency of torsional oscillations  @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ results ] , we describe in detail our calculations .",
    "we present first two alternative methods of calculating the velocity field in the vortex free case , and discuss the results obtained for this field and the moment of inertia .",
    "we compare our results for the ncri with those of experiments on solid @xmath8 in blocked annular geometry and point out other implications of our results for experimental studies of superfluidity .",
    "we then explain how to include vortices in our description and calculate the critical angular velocity for vortex nucleation .",
    "a summary of our results is presented in the concluding section  [ summary ] .",
    "we consider , as explained above , superfluid flow in an ideal cylinder , long enough in the @xmath13 direction so that edge effects are negligible and the problem quasi two - dimensional .",
    "the cross sections of the cylinders that we will consider will be bounded by two concentric circular arcs of radii @xmath1 and @xmath0 ( with @xmath14 ) and encompassing an angle that we will call @xmath3 . in the limit @xmath6 the shape of this cross section is that of a circular wedge .",
    "we will consider all values of @xmath3 , @xmath15 .",
    "it must be emphasized that the case @xmath16 is not the same as that of a ring , since a boundary along a radius still exists .    in the absence of vortices ( the generalization to the case when",
    "vortices are present will be discussed below ) the superfluid velocity field @xmath17 for an incompressible fluid satisfies :    [ basic ] @xmath18    the boundary condition corresponding to superfluid rotation around some center @xmath19 with uniform angular velocity @xmath20 is that  @xcite the normal component of the fluid s velocity at the boundary must equal the normal component of the rigid - body velocity @xmath21 at that point .",
    "that is , the component of @xmath17 along the outward normal @xmath22 to the boundary must equal , at any point on the boundary , the component of @xmath21 along @xmath22 at that point : @xmath23 were @xmath24 is a vector from @xmath19 to a point on the boundary .",
    "the point @xmath19 is not necessarily the center of mass of the system : in general we will take it to be , for reasons of obvious computational convenience , the center of the arc or arcs that are part of the boundaries of our system .",
    "there are two obvious ways to solve eqs .",
    "( [ basic ] ) .",
    "the first is to introduce a scalar potential @xmath25 such that @xmath26 . in that case",
    "@xmath25 satisfies the laplace equation , @xmath27 , and eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) is a neumann boundary condition on @xmath28 .",
    "alternatively , one can introduce a stream function @xmath29 such that :    [ vp ] @xmath30    where one can think of @xmath31 as the @xmath13 component of a vector potential @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath29 also satisfies the laplace equation , @xmath33 .",
    "now , however , the boundary conditions are of the dirichlet form  @xcite : at any point in the boundary , @xmath34    it turns out , as we will see , that for certain special values of @xmath3 such as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the scalar potential method is much simpler to use and leads to expressions for @xmath17 in the form of rapidly convergent series which are very convenient . however",
    ", for other values of @xmath3 , this method becomes rather awkward .",
    "the stream function method on the other hand can be used for any value of @xmath3 , but the resulting expressions involve asymptotic series .",
    "these are , however , borel summable and agree with the results obtained from @xmath25 in the cases where the scalar potential method works well .",
    "for this reason , we will first present here results obtained from @xmath25 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 and then consider the general case using the stream function .",
    "once the velocity field is obtained , the angular momentum ( and hence the moment of inertia ) can be calculated by straightforward integration of the velocity field . in this way",
    ", the depletion of the moment of inertia from its rigid body value is obtained . in general our origin",
    "@xmath19 is not the center of mass ( com ) of the system : therefore it is important to discuss an interesting property of the nature of the parallel axis theorem shift in the superfluid case .",
    "if one considers the moment of inertia of the superfluid with respect to the com , @xmath37 one finds , of course , that it is always smaller than that of the corresponding rigid object ( ro ) of the same shape and density , @xmath38 . indeed , for the case of a circle @xmath37 vanishes . with respect to an arbitrary origin",
    "@xmath19 one has for the superfluid a total moment of inertia @xmath39 where the last term is the parallel axis shift .",
    "the key point here is that this shift is the same as that for the rigid object .",
    "one has : @xmath40 the proof of this theorem is very simple : the problem , as defined by the above equations and boundary conditions , is linear . if one shifts the origin from the com to a point a distance @xmath41 away from it , the velocity field of the boundaries shifts to @xmath42 . in view of this , the linearity of the problem , and the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) , the solution of the shifted problem is the velocity field computed with respect to rotations around the com , plus a uniform velocity field @xmath43 .",
    "this second field trivially satisfies the equations and takes care of the additional term in the boundary condition .",
    "but it is trivial to verify that such a constant field leads simply to a parallel axis theorem shift in the moment of inertia equal to that for the corresponding rigid object .",
    "this applies irrespective of the shape of the object : it is not limited to the wedge shapes considered here .",
    "it is straightforward to check by direct calculation that it applies , for example , to the ellipsoidal shapes of ref .  .",
    "this theorem has physical consequences : since the parallel axis shift can not be `` depleted '' from its ro value by the superfluid flow , in general the fractional depletion of @xmath44 will always be largest when the rotation is around the com .      to illustrate the results ,",
    "let us first turn to the simplest case where @xmath10 , @xmath6 ( a circle with a wall along its radius ) .",
    "for this case , one can very simply use the scalar potential method .",
    "we write , in polar coordinates : @xmath46 with the radial wall set along the @xmath47 direction , the azimuthal component of the velocity , @xmath48 must equal @xmath49 at @xmath47 .",
    "this immediately tells us that all the @xmath50 vanish except @xmath51 , which equals @xmath52 .",
    "the radial component is then : @xmath53 at @xmath54 we have @xmath55 and from this one obtains that all the @xmath56 with even @xmath57 are zero while for odd @xmath57 : @xmath58 from these and eqs .",
    "( [ vtcircle ] ) and ( [ vrcircle ] ) we have the final result for the velocity field :    [ vcircle ] @xmath59    where @xmath60 .",
    "two remarks are needed about these simple results : first , the series involved are very rapidly convergent .",
    "second , the velocity components have a square root singularity at the origin .",
    "mathematically , the singularity is integrable , and allows for the formal calculation of the moment of inertia .",
    "physically , the relevant number is the value of @xmath61 at which the velocity would exceed the landau critical velocity @xmath62 . for liquid @xmath63 ,",
    "@xmath64cm / s  @xcite , and in typical experiments on supersolid behavior , the maximum value of @xmath12 is less than @xmath65 ( see for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this would mean than only at values of @xmath66 around @xmath67 would @xmath62 be exceeded .",
    "such small values of @xmath61 would not have any experimentally measurable consequence ( the hydrodynamic description we use would not even apply to such length scales ) .",
    "also this divergence is not present for nonzero values of the inner radius @xmath0 , and the inner radius is finite ( of order @xmath68 cm ) in torsion and rotation experiments .",
    "thus , this divergence is not important for @xmath63 .",
    "this divergence may have observable consequences in bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in cold atomic systems  @xcite , although our incompressibility and uniform density assumptions are not applicable to bec in cold atomic systems , where the high compressibility and the confining potential introduces substantial variations in the density .",
    "we show later that the divergence discussed above is present in blocked wedges for all values of @xmath3 greater than @xmath35 .",
    "the effects of this divergence are discussed in sections  [ vortex ] and [ freeen ] .",
    "the angular momentum is obtained by integration of @xmath69 over the sample and the moment of inertia is just the ratio of the angular momentum and the angular velocity @xmath12 .",
    "we will use units in which the areal mass density is unity .",
    "we obtain the result : @xmath70 which , after numerically evaluating the rapidly convergent series , gives @xmath71 .",
    "thus we have for this obstructed circle : @xmath72    the same method can be used at @xmath11 . in that case",
    "the only significant difference is that in the expression for @xmath25 one must write : @xmath73 as before , all the coefficients @xmath74 are determined from the boundary conditions on @xmath75 at @xmath47 and @xmath76",
    ". both are satisfied if all @xmath74 vanish except @xmath77 .",
    "the @xmath56 are determined then from the boundary condition on @xmath78 .",
    "the result for the velocity field is :    [ vhcircle ] @xmath79    the series are again convergent , and now the previously found integrable singularity at the origin is absent .",
    "the moment of inertia with respect to the origin is : @xmath80 numerically , we have @xmath81 which gives a ratio @xmath82 , a value higher than that for the circle . however , we must recall that in this case @xmath19 is not the com and that ( as shown above ) there is no reduction in the parallel axis term so that from the point of view of the com the reduction must be larger .",
    "indeed one finds that : @xmath83 which is actually a little less than that for the circle .",
    "one can see that it is awkward to extend this simple procedure to other values of @xmath3 .",
    "if one sets for example @xmath84 and doubles again the angles and powers in the expression for @xmath25 one finds that it is not possible to satisfy the boundary condition for @xmath75 at @xmath47 and @xmath85 from a single term in the first sum ( the @xmath74 coefficients ) in the potential .",
    "similar difficulties are found at e.g. @xmath86 .",
    "although these difficulties should not be unsurmountable , we will instead use the stream function method in the general case and deal appropriately there with the mathematical difficulties associated with the asymptotic series that then result .    .",

    "the moment of inertia about an axis passing through its tip is close to the rigid - body value if the opening angle @xmath3 is small , and it decreases as @xmath3 is increased ( see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the results summarized above are for the case where there are no vortices , so that the velocity field is irrotational .",
    "since one expects vortices to be nucleated as the rotational speed in increased , we have used a free - energy criterion to determine the critical angular speed for the nucleation of a vortex in the system .",
    "we find that in standard `` supersolid '' experiments the relevant range of geometries and speeds includes both the parameter region where vortices are absent and that where nucleated vortices exist .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath10 ( ring geometry ) , the critical angular speed increases rapidly as the aspect ratio @xmath103 is increased above about 0.5 ( see fig .  [ fig6 ] ) . also , the increase in the moment of inertia due to the nucleation of a vortex is rather small ( less than 10% ) in all cases .",
    "these observations imply that the results mentioned above for a narrow ring without vortices remain , for @xmath8 , valid for relatively large values of the angular velocity .",
    "mathematically , a number of relevant results have been uncovered and emphasized .",
    "there are a number of technical difficulties in the calculation of the velocity fields , leading to non - convergent series and singularities .",
    "however , the singularities are integrable and the series are borel summable , so that there is no difficulty in calculating physical quantities such as the angular momentum and the kinetic energy .",
    "we also point out the occurrence of a mathematical singularity in the velocity field in wedges ( but not in rings ) with @xmath7 and discuss possible effects of this divergence .",
    "this singularity turns out to have no measurable consequence in experimental studies of @xmath8 , but may be relevant in studies of cold atomic systems confined in wedge - shaped traps .",
    "in general , the ideas and methods developed here can be used in other geometries .",
    "we believe that the results and techniques presented here can be very useful in understanding not only ncri phenomena in `` supersolid '' helium , but also superflow in confined geometries and in finite systems .",
    "work in which we apply these ideas to study the ncri effect in realistic models of grain boundary networks is in progress .",
