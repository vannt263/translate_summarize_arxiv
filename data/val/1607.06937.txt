    "the young radio sources , including compact steep spectrum ( css ) and gigahertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio sources , are believed to represent the earliest stages in the evolution of the powerful radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "some of them are found to be associated with galaxies mergers @xcite or ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) @xcite .",
    "recent observations also manifest that some radio - loud narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies / quasars ( nls1s ) have the radio properties consistent with css radio sources @xcite .",
    "nls1s are classified based on their narrow balmer lines ( with the full width at half maximum , fwhm @xmath1 ) , small ratio between [ o iii]@xmath25007 and h@xmath0 ( [ o iii]@xmath25007/h@xmath0 @xmath3 3 ) and strong emission of fe ii complexes ( fe ii @xmath24570/h@xmath0 @xmath4 0.5 , ) .",
    "these features are explained as a result of relatively small mass of the central black hole with high accretion rate ( @xcite , but also see @xcite ) .",
    "thus nls1s are suggested to be during the early stage of the accretion activities .",
    "the accretion rates of young radio sources are found to be relatively high , with the average value similar with nls1s @xcite .",
    "thus the young radio sources can also stand during the early stage of accretion activities .",
    "moreover , there is another similar feature between the young radio sources and nls1s . that is the blue wing of narrow [ o iii ] @xcite .",
    "this feature is always explained as the outflow originated from the disk wind or galactic wind .",
    "some results indicate that the strength of the blueshift is related to the eddington ratio @xcite , while other explanations refer to the jet - ism interaction @xcite .",
    "although the common radio properties between nls1s and young radio sources have been discussed frequently in the literature , the common optical properties between them are less discussed . in this paper",
