    "nuclear rings in barred spiral galaxies are regions of large gas surface densities and high star formation .",
    "their existence is intimately related to the stellar bars with which they are associated .",
    "the stellar bar drives the interstellar medium ( ism ) into the nuclear ring .",
    "how the radius of the ring is determined is unclear .",
    "the radius may be set by the location of the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) of the stellar bar ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the reasoning behind this idea is that the sign of the torque changes on either side of the lindblad resonance .",
    "alternatively , the radius may be at the location where the non - axisymmetric bar weakens , which is typically at @xmath1 of the size of the bar @xcite .",
    "finally , it may also be determined by where the transition from phase space domination of @xmath2 orbits ( parallel to the major axis of the large - scale bar ) to the phase space domination of @xmath3 orbits ( perpendicular to the bar ) occurs @xcite .",
    "regardless of how they are formed they are interesting as a class because they are perhaps the largest population of nearby star bursting regions .",
    "they form star clusters in prodigious amounts and are the only environment where super star clusters ( sscs ) might be found in abundance in normal galaxies @xcite .",
    "these sscs can have masses in excess of @xmath4m@xmath5  and may be the progenitors of globular clusters if they can survive for @xmath6 years .    in some of these systems",
    "the location of these star clusters is curious .",
    "they appear to be at larger radii than the gas ring from which they are presumably formed .",
    "for instance , the morphology of ngc1512 clearly show the star cluster(s ) exterior ( radially ) to the gas as opposed to being embedded in the gas @xcite .",
    "taking another example , in ngc4314 the star clusters are at larger radii than the gas in the nuclear ring @xcite .",
    "finally , @xcite find that in their sample of 123 galaxies , eight have strong nuclear rings and in each of the eight , star formation occurs outside of the dust ring .",
    "two of their other galaxies have dust lanes immediately interior to what appears to be an older stellar ring .",
    "there are two possible explanations for why these star clusters are external to the gas .",
    "first , while the gas can lose angular momentum due to dissipation , the stars and star clusters are collisionless and hence remain on larger orbits @xcite .",
    "second , the star clusters migrated outward after their formation .",
    "we explore the latter possibility in this paper .",
    "we argue that tidal interactions between the star cluster and the nuclear ring from which it was formed leads to their separation .",
    "we apply the physics of `` gas shepherding '' , which was studied by one of us ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c08 ) , to this cluster - ring system .",
    "we derive a natural length scale for this separation , which we call the `` hill radius '' of the ring . at the same time , we show that the outer edge of the ring can experience a surface density enhancement of a few , possibly leading to additional formation of stars and star clusters along the edge of the ring .",
    "finally , we find that if the star clusters are massive and/or numerous enough the cluster - ring systems as a whole is expected to migrate inward .",
    "we show that these predictions can be tested observationally .",
    "we present our model in ",

    "a sample of 22 nuclear rings , @xcite find that the rings are in the same plane as the disk of their host galaxy and that they are intrinsically circular .",
    "typically , the radius of the ring is around @xmath7kpc , but it can be a factor three smaller or larger . with a circular velocity at the ring radius of around @xmath8kms@xmath9 , the ( spherically )",
    "enclosed mass is about @xmath10m@xmath5 .",
    "the gaseous mass in the ring may be estimated from high spatial resolution co measurements , using the standard conversion to @xmath11   mass and adding @xmath12 for he . in this way",
    ", we obtain for ngc5457 , ngc3351 , ngc6951 , ngc3504 @xcite and ngc4314 @xcite on average a mass inside the ring of @xmath13m@xmath5 . although the ring mass may be as much as a factor ten smaller or two larger , it correlates with the ring radius , so that the ring - to - enclosed mass ratio @xmath14 stays within a narrow range of @xmath15 . while this is the molecular gas inside the ring , part of the gas",
    "is being ionized , due to photons from newly formed massive stars or due to shocks from stellar winds or supernovae explosions , and at the inner edge of the ring possibly even due to an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "however , the ionized gas mass estimated from the @xmath16   ( plus [ nii ] ) emission is generally two orders of magnitude lower than the molecular gas mass ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the nuclear rings are easily observable due to the emission from the massive stars inside the young star clusters in the ring ( which in the ultraviolet even dominates the emission from a possible agn ) .",
    "the combination of high - spatial resolution ( hst ) images and multi - wavelength coverage , makes it possible to isolate the individual clusters and after correction for ( dust ) extinction to estimate their mass and ( relative ) age .",
    "below we use such a study by @xcite to investigate in more detail the nuclear ring in ngc4314 .",
    "overall , the cluster masses follow a power - law distribution with index @xmath17 , similar to young star clusters in merging galaxies such as the antennae @xcite , but typically extending to a smaller upper limit in mass ( few times @xmath18m@xmath5 ) , i.e. , fewer of the so - called `` super star clusters '' ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , these young star clusters are most likely just the latest star formation in an ongoing succession of bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "most of the lower - mass clusters dissolve , either early - on ( @xmath19myr ) due to violent relaxation after expelling the residual gas ( infant mortality ) depending on the star formation efficiency ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or later - on due to internal relaxation ( evaporation ) and external tidal effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting evolution towards a bell - shaped distribution implies a relative increase in more massive star clusters over time .",
    "unfortunately , once the most massive stars have died , the luminosity of star clusters very rapidly fades , so that it becomes more difficult to distinguish them from the old stellar population of their host galaxy . nevertheless , based on velocity dispersion measurements from stellar absorption lines , @xcite",
    "estimate dynamical masses up to almost @xmath20m@xmath5  for individual star clusters in the nuclear ring of ngc3351 . henceforth , the typical ratio of cluster - to - ring mass ratios @xmath21 depends on the ( average ) age of the star clusters . for the young , luminous star clusters we adopt the range @xmath22 ,",
    "whereas for the old(er ) , faint(er ) star cluster @xmath23 is probably more appropriate .",
    "below we investigate the two cases @xmath24 and @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath26m@xmath5  and @xmath27m@xmath5  in case of the above average gas mass in nuclear rings of @xmath28m@xmath5 . the effect of a less massive star cluster with @xmath29 is similar to that of @xmath25 .",
    "the time for a star cluster to cross the nuclear ring is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the orbital frequency and @xmath32 is newton s constant of gravity .",
    "given a typical circular velocity of @xmath33kms@xmath9  at the observed mean nuclear ring radius of @xmath34kpc , the crossing time is around @xmath35myr .",
    "a star cluster is subject to dynamical friction with the bulge stars on a ( minimum ) timescale @xmath36 , with @xmath37 the coulomb logarithm . using @xmath38 and substituting @xmath39 from above , we find that the dynamical friction time in units of the crossing time is approximately given by @xmath40 .",
    "this means hundreds to tens of orbits for star clusters with masses that are @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) to @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) of the nuclear ring mass , or , with @xmath45myr , a dynamical friction time @xmath46 from about @xmath47gyr to @xmath48myr for a non - rotating bulge , which we will assume for the remainder of this work .",
    "we illustrate our basic model in a cartoon in figure [ fig : cartoon ] .",
    "gas flowing in a bar potential along the @xmath2 orbits transitions to @xmath3 orbits making up the nuclear ring .",
    "the @xmath3 orbits are approximately circular and so we will approximate them as circles . from the gas in the nuclear ring stars are formed in star clusters .",
    "we assume that the star clusters are formed preferentially near the outer edge .",
    "these newly formed and forming star clusters are subject to dynamical friction with the background bulge stars is a valid approximation . ] and tidal interactions with the ring .",
    "the initial tidal interactions are strong compared to dynamical friction and thus these star clusters will initially move _ away _ from the ring .",
    "indeed , in observations of nuclear rings young star clusters often appear to be at larger radii than the gas ring from which they are presumably formed .",
    "the color composite images of ngc1512 @xcite , ngc4314",
    "@xcite , and ngc7742 ( hubble heritage ) , show young star cluster as bright spots on the outside of gas traced by the dust .",
    "as pointed out by the referee , from these images it is also clear that , even though the nuclear rings are as we assume approximately circular with star clusters at the outer edge , the observations can be quite difficult and complex .",
    "first , when resolved in the optical the rings can look like tightly wound spirals .",
    "this might be just appearance because the bar dust lanes connecting with the ring are also partly obscuring the ring in optical broad - band images , whereas in e.g.  narrow - band imaging around @xmath16  the ring of young star clusters seem to be complete ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , our basic picture described above for a circular ring should still provide a fair description in case of a tightly wound spiral .",
    "second , very obscured star clusters could remain hidden below the gas ring even in the near infrared images taken , whereas even longer wavelength observations ( yet ) lack the high spatial resolution required to resolve the star clusters .",
    "even so , the clearing of gas and dust from the newly formed star cluster is very fast and efficient , as even the youngest visible star clusters are only mildly reddened ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "finally , some ( sectors of ) star clusters seem to appear more on the inside of the nuclear ring , possibly along an inward extension of the gas inspiraling onto the ring along the large - scale bar . as we discuss briefly in   [ sec : discussion_star_formation ] , star clusters may form within the ring , in particular at the contact points where the gas flows into the ring . moreover , the interaction of non - axisymmetric structures inside the ring ( such as nuclear bars and spirals ) with the interstellar medium may also induce the formation of star clusters .",
    "however , even though such additional mechanism might be operating and the observations should be interpret with care , they in general support our basic picture of a circular nuclear ring with young stars migrating outward .",
    "since the basic physics mirror the `` gas shepherding '' scenario studied by c08 , we adopt the same notation . in this case",
    "the satellite is a star cluster and the disk is a ring , but since only the ( local ) geometry at the edge matters the physics remains the same .",
    "there are however two important differences with respect to c08 .",
    "first , the perturbing star cluster s initial radial position begins very close to the ring as opposed to a satellite reaching the disk from very far away in c08 .",
    "due to ring tidal interactions , the star cluster and ring will separate to establish an initial separation , @xmath49 , which we show below is of order the `` hill radius '' of the ring .",
    "we aim to study the manner by which this initial separation is achieved .",
    "second , gas continues to flow in from the @xmath2 orbits so that at the transition between the @xmath2 to @xmath3 orbits , gas is continuously being added to the system .",
    "therefore , a source of mass exists in this system , which changes the dynamics .    for now",
    "we ignore the source of mass to concentrate just on the tidal interaction between the ring and star cluster and the dynamical friction experienced by the star cluster .",
    "we begin by showing that this combined action of dynamical friction and ring tides results in a length scale in the problem , which we call the hill radius of the ring .",
    "the torque due to dynamical friction on the star cluster is @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mass of the star cluster , @xmath52 is its distance from the center of the galaxy , @xmath53 is its orbital frequency , and , as before , @xmath46 is the timescale for dynamical friction .",
    "the torque due to the excitation of spiral density waves in a disk is @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the mass of the ring with radius @xmath56 . the radial separation between the star cluster and the ring @xmath57 is assumed to be small compared to the distance to the center",
    ", i.e. , @xmath58 . while dynamical friction torques down the star cluster , the ring torques up the star cluster .",
    "balancing these two torques , i.e. , @xmath59 , gives @xmath60 where the latter defines the hill radius of the ring .",
    "given the observed range in ring - to - enclosed mass of @xmath61 (   [ sec : properties ] ) , the hill radius is around @xmath62 of the radius @xmath52 of the star cluster . since @xmath63 , the observed range in nuclear ring radii of @xmath64kpc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) results in @xmath65pc .",
    "we expect the radial separation between the star cluster and nuclear ring to be of order of this hill radius .",
    "however , the exact amount and nature by which this separation will be achieved depends strongly on the strength of the tidal torque between the cluster and the ring , which we intend to quantify in this paper .    the second process which we wish to study is the effect of an additional source of mass on the dynamics of the cluster - ring system .",
    "the gas merges onto the nuclear ring at the two contact points where the @xmath2 orbits transition to @xmath3 orbits .",
    "we assume that the region where the gas is added to the nuclear ring is radially narrow compared to the radius of the nuclear ring . for a mass inflow rate of @xmath66",
    ", the amount of angular momentum added to a system per unit time is @xmath67 however , not all of this angular momentum can be immediately applied to affecting the qualitative dynamics of the system . by qualitative , we mean that the mass inflow rate , which acts as a source of angular momentum , changes the behavior of the cluster - ring system .",
    "for instance , the source of angular momentum from mass inflow balances the sink of angular momentum from dynamical friction on the star cluster . to estimate what mass inflow rate",
    "would be needed to effect such a change , we suppose this mass is added just inside of the satellite radial position , i.e. , @xmath68 .",
    "the mass will then be pushed to the edge of the ring , @xmath69 , due to tidal interactions .",
    "the change in radial position will be of order the hill radius of the disk , @xmath70 .",
    "hence , for such a parcel of gas of mass @xmath71 , the change in angular momentum moving from @xmath52 to @xmath69 is @xmath72 for a constant mass inflow rate @xmath66 , we expect the torque from this inflow of gas , acting on the star cluster , to be @xmath73 setting this inflow torque equal to the dynamical friction torque in eq .",

    "however , while the position of the ( young ) star clusters with respect to the center of their host galaxy is straightforward to measure , the radial extent of the gas in the ring is often difficult to determine .",
    "it requires high spatial resolution co measurements to trace the underlying molecular gas .",
    "also , part of the gas ( at the edge ) of the ring may be severely disturbed due to winds that clear out the gas and dust from the newly formed star clusters and/or ionized by the massive , bright stars in the young star cluster ( but see   [ sec : discussion_star_formation ] and   [ sec : discussion_stellar_feedback ] ) .",

    ", the ( unique ) measurement of a separation is complicated by the spread in radius of the star clusters .",
    "part of this spread is because of the dependence of the dynamical friction time on the mass of the star cluster : @xmath184 . even though we found that it takes less than @xmath41 of the dynamical friction time to reach about half of the hill radius , with a typical crossing time of @xmath45myr , this means only @xmath47myr for the most massive star clusters ( @xmath44 ) , but as much as @xmath48myr for the least massive clusters ( @xmath185 ) . since @xmath186 , to reach the full separation takes a factor @xmath139 longer .",
    "this means that only the most massive clusters reach at least half of the hill radius separation before all bright , massive stars die .",
    "the less massive clusters have already faded significantly , or even dissolved .",

    "unfortunately , we found that the more massive cluster indeed rapidly reach a maximum separation , but after staying a while at this radius ( depending on the mass inflow rate ) , they move inward again by pushing the ring inward ( compare for example the top panels of figures  [ fig : md0.01 ] and  [ fig : md0.1 ] ) . hence , over time the less massive clusters , if they survive , may catch up with the more massive clusters . we conclude that only among the ( very ) young ( few myr ) clusters we might expect a radial gradient with the more massive clusters to the outside , from which the hill radius can be estimated . later on ,",
    "if a radial gradient is visible at all , it might even be opposite , with the more massive clusters on the inside . since the more massive clusters have higher survival chance , the latter turn around may result in at most a mild radial gradient in age ( with the older clusters on the inside ) .",
    "@xcite find only for 2 ( out of 22 ) nuclear ring galaxies , a radial age gradient with indeed ( slightly ) older clusters on the inside .",
    "unlike the radial age gradient , @xcite , as in other detailed studies ( e.g.  by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , do find signatures of an azimuthal age gradient in most of the nuclear rings , ranging from clean bipolar age gradients to a correlation between the youngest star clusters and the contact points of the bar dust arms with the nuclear ring .",
    "the natural explanation is that at ( or very close to ) these contact points the inflowing gas shocks and forms stars , after which the resulting star cluster travels in the ring away from the contact points .",

    "* ) the corresponding time for the contacts points to rotate is @xmath188myr , significantly shorter than the local crossing time @xmath35myr .",
    "alternatively , if the star formation occurs due to ( local ) gravitational instability of the gas in the ring , the star clusters are expected to form throughout the ring without an azimuthal age gradient . instead of associating this instability with an inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is a natural consequence of shepherding : the gas in the ring loses angular momentum to the star cluster(s ) , which in turn lose angular momentum to the host galaxy through dynamical friction .",
    "this means that gas at the edge of the ring moves inward , resulting in an increase in the gas surface density at the edge ( see also figures  [ fig : md0.01 ] , [ fig : md0.1 ] and  [ fig : md0.1_mdot0.1 ] ) , until its becomes unstable against self - gravity .    in the case of shepherding we",
    "do expect , as observed , a mixture in azimuthal age gradients .",
    "initially , when the gas surface density in the ring is below the critical value for star formation , star clusters only form in episodes at the two contact points , they move together with the remaining gas along the ring , resulting in bipolar age gradient .",
    "the newly formed star clusters move outward , while at the same time pushing the gas inward , causing an over - density built - up at the edge of the ring .",
    "when the gas surface density somewhere along the edge of the ring reaches the critical value , it becomes unstable and forms stars .",
    "the more massive the star cluster ( or group of star clusters acting together ) , the higher the over - density and the sooner the critical value is reached . generally , the most massive clusters and hence the star formation might be anywhere along the ring .",
    "however , depending on the mass inflow rate , there might be relatively more gas near the contact points to start with , so that first instability - driven star clusters still form near the contact points .",
    "therefore , an azimuthal age gradient might still exist over part of the ring , but eventually the gradient is expected to flatten .",
    "we found in ",
    "[ sec : constant_mass_inflow_rate ] that for a low enough mass inflow rate , the ( most massive of the ) existing star clusters move inward by dynamical friction , while pushing and increasing the surface mass density of the gas in the outer part of the nuclear ring . as a result",
    ", the gas might reach the critical surface mass density and form new stars ( in clusters ) all along the edge of the ring . at the same time ,",
    "near the contact points , which also move inward along with the nuclear ring , star formation from inflowing and shocking gas might be ongoing .",
    "we argue below in   [ sec : ngc4314 ] that the nuclear ring in ngc4314 is an example of this mechanism . since even in the case of a high mass inflow rate ,",

    "whereas during the inward migration the gas surface density along ( the edge of ) the ring was insufficient to form stars , shocks at the contact points might still have allowed the formation of stars . while the contact points moved inward together with the ring",

    "the star cluster that is being formed in the nuclear ring is already subject to dynamical friction while it is still a gas clump , as long as the material that makes up the ( proto ) star cluster is bound enough relative to the background stellar population of the host galaxy . since this gas clump contains ( significant ) more mass than the final cluster of only stars ,",
    "the initial dynamical friction is ( much ) stronger .",
    "however , the clearing of gas ( and dust ) from the newly formed star cluster is very fast and efficient , since even the youngest visible star clusters are only mildly reddened ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the gas in the nuclear ring is uniform , i.e. , no gas clouds ( or clumps ) aside from those which turn into star clusters . since such gas clouds would also be subject to dynamical friction from the background bulge stars and thus move inward , dynamical friction on the nuclear ring itself has also been proposed as an explanation of the inward migration of the nuclear ring in for example ngc4314 @xcite .",
    "suppose that the gas is made up of @xmath233 gas clouds of the same mass @xmath234 , then about @xmath235 clouds are needed to have a combined dynamical friction torque of the same order as that of a single star cluster of mass @xmath236 .",

    "we thus conclude either nearly no inward migration ( @xmath247 ) , or gas that is very clumpy with quite large gas clouds ( @xmath248 ) .",

    "for the relatively small star clusters formed on the inside , we expect the inward migration to follow that of forming proto planets ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , if the gas flowing along the bar is very clumpy , possess a different vertical scale height , or a different inclination than the gas ring , it may not ( only ) merge at the outermost radius . in this way , even rather large star clusters might form on the inner edge of the nuclear ring .",
    "they then migrate further inward ( relatively faster than cluster formed on the outer edge as they encounter less of the gas ring ) , possibly along an inward extension of the inspiraling gas .",
    "whereas these are possible explanations for the observation that some star clusters appear more on the inside of the nuclear ring ( see also   [ sec : basic_picture ] ) , alternatively they might form already inside of the ring as the result of the local interaction of a non - axisymmetric structure such as a nuclear bar or spiral with the interstellar medium ( see also ",

    "2 .   while such a massive cluster moves out the surface mass density of the gas at the edge of the nuclear ring is pushed inward and gets enhanced by a factor of a few .",
    "if this enhancement reaches the critical value for star formation , new star clusters are expected to form along the ring .",
    "this is in addition to the ( ongoing ) formation of star cluster from shocking gas near the contact points .",
    "the ( initial ) azimuthal age gradient that is expected from the latter gets diluted or even washed out by the former ( secondary ) star cluster formation .",
    "if the ( formed ) star cluster are massive and/or numerous enough , and the gas mass inflow rate low enough ( or even shut down ) , we expect the inward migration of the cluster - ring system as a whole .",
    "this mean that , even though initially the nuclear ring could have formed as often suggested at an ( inner ) lindblad resonance , it can migrate closer to the center of the host galaxy .",
    "the latter implies that the most massive star cluster , after an initial outward separation , turn around and migrate inward along with the nuclear ring .",
    "consequently , any initial radial age gradient due to the dynamical friction time being inverse proportional to the mass of the star cluster , is diluted or even inverted .",
    "even so , both a radial and azimuthal age gradient are observationally difficult to measure .",
    "when the most massive stars are still alive , the bright emission lines can be used for ( relative ) age dating ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but after a few tens of million years it becomes already very challenging to distinguish the fading star clusters from the background stellar population ( but see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the outward migration of a least the most massive star clusters is easier to establish , and using the dust to trace the gas , observations indeed show the young star clusters exterior to the nuclear ring .",
    "the measured separation should be of the order of the hill radius of the nuclear ring , which indeed is the case in ngc4314 .",
    "this well - studied nuclear ring also seems to have migrated inward , leaving a tail of older star clusters behind and being currently located between the inner and outer ilr . to firmly confirm such a `` shepherding of gas '' towards smaller radii ,",
    "the dynamics of the host galaxy , including the ( bar ) pattern speed , needs to be measured accurately .",
