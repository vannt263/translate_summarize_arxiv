    "holographic dualities purport to map field theories to gravitational systems in higher dimensions .",
    "the first examples of holographic duality mapped conformal ( relativistic ) field theories in @xmath0 spacetime dimensions to @xmath1-dimensional anti - de sitter space .",
    "interest in using the power of holography , as a strong - weak duality , for applications in condensed matter physics has driven extensions of holographic dualities to non - relativistic field theories .",
    "if these maps are actually dualities , then they should run in both directions : that is , we should be able to reconstruct bulk information from boundary data , in addition to computing boundary quantities from bulk physics . in the ads context , boundary entanglement entropies have been successfully used to reconstruct information about the bulk spacetime metric .",
    "the work of this paper will be to extend ads reconstruction schemes to lifshitz spacetimes .",
    "initial approaches to spacetime reconstruction concentrated on rebuilding field profiles on top of a fixed background ; for example , via the smearing function @xcite .",
    "this smearing function , which takes normalizable boundary information and outputs the bulk field profile , requires a momentum cut - off , limiting its locality , in both black hole spacetimes @xcite and non - relativistic spacetimes including lifshitz spacetimes @xcite .    to fully rebuild the spacetime ,",
    "however , we must also reconstruct the bulk metric itself .",
    "success at reconstructing metric information has increased since the ryu - takayanagi ( rt ) proposal @xcite and its subsequent covariant generalization by hubeny - rangamani - takayanagi ( hrt ) @xcite were developed .",
    "these proposals relate the entanglement entropy of a spacelike co - dimension one boundary region to the area of the bulk extremal surface homologous to this region .",
    "this relationship was used by @xcite to perturbatively reconstruct einstein s equation linearized about ads spacetime .",
    "direct approaches to reconstruct the metric from boundary data include @xcite .",
    "additionally , the ` hole - ography ' @xcite and differential entropy @xcite approaches reconstruct the length of a bulk curve from a family of boundary entanglement entropies .",
    "as the entanglement entropy is defined in terms of the density matrix for a boundary subregion , it is natural to ask what bulk region is reconstructible from this density matrix @xcite .",
    "two regions to consider are the ` entanglement wedge ' @xcite and the ` causal wedge ' @xcite , the latter of which additionally defines the causal holographic information surface .",
    "the entanglement wedge is the causal development of the bulk slice bounded by the extremal surface used to compute entanglement entropy and the boundary subregion itself . the causal wedge , on the other hand , depends purely on causal relations : it is the intersection of the bulk past and bulk future of the boundary domain of dependence of the boundary subregion .    the particular class of non - relativistic field theories whose",
    "dual we will study are those obeying lifshitz symmetry .",
    "under this symmetry , time and space scale differently : @xmath2 while @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is referred to as the dynamical exponent . the dual spacetime , termed lifshitz spacetime , was proposed in @xcite and has been studied intensively since ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the reconstruction of a lifshitz spacetime from three perspectives : differential entropy , causal wedges and entanglement wedges .",
    "since entanglement - based spacetime reconstruction schemes often rely upon the ryu - takayanagi proposal and its covariant generalization , let us pause to consider its application to lifshitz spacetimes .",
    "most authors have assumed these proposals apply to spacetimes with non - relativistic duals ; for example , see @xcite ( and also @xcite ) . for vacuum lifshitz spacetime",
    ", the induced metric on a constant time slice can not be distinguished from a constant ( poincar ) time slice in ads ; this means that any result confined to a constant time slice in vacuum lifshitz will be as if the dynamical exponent @xmath4 has been set to one .",
    "see @xcite for a sample of entanglement entropy calculations in lifshitz field theories .    the simplest way to probe",
    "the dynamical exponent is to consider the entanglement entropy of a boundary region not on a constant time slice .",
    "however , given both the lack of conformal boundary in a lifshitz spacetime and the even more important lack of a physical interpretation for a boundary region of non - constant time in a non - relativistic field theory , this approach can not provide field theoretic justification for the covariant holographic entropy proposal in lifshitz spacetimes . even for boundary regions on a constant time slice , where the dependence on @xmath4 is introduced via a non - zero temperature black brane setup or some other asymptotically lifshitz solution , comparison with field theory results",
    "is difficult .",
    "lifshitz field theories have less symmetry than conformal field theories , so many of the field theory entanglement entropy calculation techniques do not work in this context .",
    "of course this difficulty highlights the importance of having a holographic entanglement calculation method , while also making such a method hard to verify .    for the body of this paper",
    ", our approach will also be to treat the rt and hrt entanglement entropy proposals as applicable to lifshitz spacetimes .",
    "however , as we discover in section [ sec : entanglementwedge ] and discuss further in the conclusions , the peculiar nature of light - sheets in lifshitz spacetime actually alters one of the justifications for the covariant entanglement entropy proposal .",
    "there are two major differences between lifshitz spacetimes and ads that will underlie our bulk reconstruction difficulties .",
    "first , only purely radially - directed light rays in lifshitz reach the boundary .",
    "any light ray with nonzero momentum in a spatial direction will instead reach a turning point and then return to the bulk .",
    "this feature will complicate both curve reconstruction via differential entropy and the construction of the entanglement wedge .",
    "the second major difference is the degeneracy of the lifshitz boundary . unlike in ads",
    ", lifshitz does not have a conformal boundary ; the metric on the boundary is degenerate .",
    "this degeneracy means the boundary domain of dependence collapses , due to the non - relativistic nature of the boundary .",
    "since it is non - relativistic , the effective speed of light is infinite , so any point in the spacetime can be affected by any point at an earlier time , regardless of its location in space .",
    "in fact , since the boundary is non - relativistic , we expect a metric - complex instead of a boundary metric .",
    "this vielbein approach to defining the boundary has been successful for holographic renormalization in non - relativistic duals @xcite . of course",
    ", we can avoid these issues if we work at a cut - off .",
    "however , we expect that removing the cut - off will result in degeneration of the causal wedge ; this is in fact the behavior we see in section [ sec : causalwedges ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section we collect conventions and simple observations about lifshitz spacetimes that will be useful throughout our discussion . in section [ reconstruction ]",
    "we obtain partial success in the reconstruction of bulk curves via the differential entropy approach .",
    "we discuss the details of the relationship between curves that are not reconstructible and light rays that turn around in lifshitz in appendix  [ appendix : screens ] .",
    "section [ sec : causalwedges ] studies the degeneration of the causal wedge , while in section [ sec : entanglementwedge ] we construct the entanglement wedge .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] contains discussion of our results and speculations about how to better reconstruct a spacetime dual to a lifshitz field theory .",
    "we work with the lifshitz metric @xmath5 where the boundary is at @xmath6 .",
    "although we will work almost entirely in three dimensions , the majority of our results will hold when @xmath7 is replaced by @xmath8 .",
    "this metric coincides with ads@xmath9 in poincar coordinates when @xmath10 .",
    "we will only consider @xmath11 as this restriction satisfies the null energy condition @xcite .",
    "as in ads , @xmath12 sets the scale for the radius of curvature of the geometry , though we will set this to unity from now on for simplicity . in section  [ reconstruction ] we will demand that the @xmath13 direction is periodic with period @xmath14 .    the radial motion of geodesics in the geometry ( with @xmath15 )",
    "is governed by an effective potential as follows : @xmath16 a dot denotes derivative with respect to an affine parameter and @xmath17 or @xmath18 for spacelike , null or timelike geodesics , respectively .",
    "the conserved quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 are associated respectively with the killing vectors @xmath21 and @xmath22 and satisfy @xmath23 in section  [ reconstruction ] we will be concerned with spacelike geodesics and the reconstruction of bulk curves .    in section  [ sec : causalwedges ] we will focus on null geodesics .",
    "beginning with the general geodesic equation , we set @xmath24 , rescale the affine parameter by @xmath19 and introduce the ( rescaled ) transverse momentum @xmath25 : @xmath26 as pointed out in @xcite , light rays with transverse momentum do not reach the boundary in lifshitz spacetime .",
    "this phenomenon is manifested by a bump in the potential @xmath27 near the boundary for any non - zero @xmath28 .",
    "classical geodesic motion must obey @xmath29 and therefore can only take place in regions for which @xmath30 , i.e.  for @xmath31 .",
    "the boundaries of these regions for different values of @xmath4 are plotted in figure  [ fig : potentiallifshitz ] . by contrast",
    ", light rays reach the boundary of an asymptotically ads spacetime if @xmath32 ( using the same conventions ) .     below which the radial effective potential for null geodesics @xmath33 for different values of @xmath4 : 1 ( blue ) , 3/2 ( yellow ) , 2 ( green ) , 3 ( red ) and 10 ( purple).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    ( 0.3,0.4)(0,0 ) ( -5.,2.8)(0,0)@xmath34 ( 0.2,0.2)(0,0)@xmath35 ( -3.6,1.2)(0,0)increasing @xmath4 ( -2.85,1.05)(1,-1)0.55    for large @xmath4 , spacetime effectively cuts off below @xmath36 as far as null geodesics with @xmath37 are concerned .",
    "this is apparent even at @xmath38 for the purple curve in figure  [ fig : potentiallifshitz ] .",
    "since lifshitz spacetime becomes ads@xmath39 as @xmath40 , this behavior is expected .",
    "light rays with non - zero momentum in the flat directions are headed towards the flat space s asymptotic infinity instead of the conformal boundary of ads@xmath41 .",
    "consider a bulk surface not anchored on the boundary of a holographic spacetime . assuming this bulk surface is not a horizon , what is its boundary interpretation ?",
    "can it be reconstructed from boundary observables ? in this section we address these questions for lifshitz spacetime .    building on the work of @xcite , a general proof relating the surface area of a generic class of bulk surfaces to the ` differential entropy ' of a particular family of boundary intervals was given in @xcite .",
    "these boundary intervals are chosen so that the extremal surfaces that calculate their holographic entanglement entropy , via the hrt conjecture , are tangent to the bulk surface whose area is being computed . in section  [ sec : differentialentropy ] we review this construction and consider an explicit example in lifshitz spacetime .",
    "however , despite the success of section  [ sec : differentialentropy ] , not all curves in lifshitz spacetime can be constructed via differential entropy , as we exhibit explicitly for a family of bulk curves in section  [ sec : badcurves ] . for these curves , there are some regions where no tangent extremal surface can reach the boundary .",
    "the situation is reminiscent to that found in @xcite , which showed that spacetimes with holographic screens , such as black hole spacetimes , must contain bulk curves beyond said screens that are not reconstructible via the ` hole - ography ' or differential entropy approach .      for simplicity",
    "we begin our discussion in poincar ads@xmath9 , given in with @xmath10 . in this section",
    "we take the @xmath13 direction to be periodic with period @xmath14 .",
    "consider a closed bulk curve @xmath42 that is not anchored on the boundary .",
    "this must respect the periodicity in @xmath13 and we insist that its tangent vector be everywhere spacelike , but otherwise it can be arbitrary . in particular , it need not be extremal",
    ". its area , or ` gravitational entropy ' , is given by the bekenstein - hawking formula : @xmath43 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "the construction of @xcite is built around a family of boundary intervals with endpoints described by the two curves @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 ) .",
    "these curves depend periodically on the parameter @xmath44 such that the intervals cover a full period of @xmath13 as @xmath44 varies in @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "although each interval must lie on a boundary cauchy slice , they need not all lie on the same one . from the curves",
    "@xmath45 , we construct a continuous family of bulk spacelike geodesics @xmath48 , where @xmath44 labels the geodesic and @xmath49 is a parameter ( not necessarily affine ) along it .",
    "the endpoints of geodesic @xmath44 are anchored on the boundary at @xmath45 . as in the hrt prescription , if there is more than one geodesic anchored at a particular pair of boundary endpoints , we take the shortest such geodesic",

    "this is given holographically by @xcite as the length ( divided by @xmath52 ) of the bulk spacelike geodesic @xmath48 .",
    "we have suggestively used @xmath44 to parametrize both the bulk curve @xmath53 and the family of boundary intervals described by the boundary curves @xmath54 , because , as proven in @xcite , the gravitational entropy and the boundary differential entropy are the same .",
    "that is , @xmath55 if we demand that the geodesics @xmath48 are tangent to the bulk curve @xmath42 at some @xmath56 .",
    "this requires @xmath57 where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "before we proceed , note that @xcite generalized this result ; for example , by relaxing the condition to allow the tangent vectors to be oppositely - oriented or not even collinear . in our simple example we will take @xmath58 .",
    "the work in @xcite also extends to a variety of other backgrounds that possess planar symmetry , including lifshitz spacetime .",
    "the relationship between the lengths of the boundary - anchored extremal curves @xmath59 and the length of the bulk curve @xmath53 is clearly preserved in lifshitz spacetime .",
    "however , in order to actually relate the differential entropy to the gravitational entropy , we require that the entanglement entropy in the boundary theory is still computed holographically by @xcite .",
    "it is not clear that this is the case for lifshitz spacetime ; for instance , the interpretation for the length of a bulk spacelike geodesic with endpoints at different times is unknown .",
    "the purpose of this section is to demonstrate the extent to which the geometric construction still goes through , regardless of the entropic interpretations , whilst also highlighting the differences between a lifshitz and an asymptotically ads spacetime .",
    "now we turn to lifshitz spacetime with @xmath60 .",
    "consider a bulk curve that sits at a fixed radius @xmath61 but varies in time and respects the periodicity in @xmath13 .",
    "we parametrize this curve by @xmath62 \\label{eq : gammab } ,   \\\\",

    "the equations we must solve are , and .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize the spacelike geodesics via the radius @xmath35 .",
    "consequently , we find pairs of functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 that describe the two halves of a geodesic , one on each side of its radial turning point .",
    "these two halves must match smoothly at the bulk curve @xmath42 so that the resulting geodesics are tangent to the curve , i.e.  so and are satisfied .",
    "the geodesic is restricted to lie on a constant - time slice . in this case",
    "the problem is identical to that studied in section 2.3 of @xcite ( in fact , for any @xmath4 ) .",
    "this geodesic will also be useful later in sections  [ sec : causalwedges ] and [ sec : entanglementwedge ] . ]",
    "the matching point between the two portions of the geodesic is where it touches the bulk curve , at @xmath61 .",
    "from we have @xmath67 this is also the turning point of the geodesic , where @xmath68 the ratio @xmath69 is fixed in terms of the geodesic s conserved quantities @xmath19 and @xmath20 via and : @xmath70 where we have applied the second tangency condition for the right hand equality .",
    "we also note that the spacelike condition ( [ eq : spacelikecondition ] ) on the bulk curve can now be rewritten as @xmath71 that is , a bulk curve at constant radius @xmath72 with a tangent geodesic having conserved quantities @xmath73 is spacelike as long as the bulk curve is located at a radius smaller then the maximum in ( [ eq : spacelikepe ] ) .",
    "since the bulk curve s tangent geodesics could have different conserved quantities at different tangent points , the maximum possible radius is set by the smallest @xmath74 attained along the entire bulk curve .",
    "moving forward , we evaluate @xmath73 using the chain rule and taking the limit @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 . comparing this result",
    "with we identify @xmath78 we will choose @xmath79 so that the orientation of the two tangent vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 agree at the point @xmath82 . @xcite . ]    from here on we restrict to @xmath83 for which we can solve the equations , and analytically .",
    "the turning point in this case satisfies @xmath84 here we have chosen the smallest positive root because we require boundary - anchored geodesics , as we will explicitly demonstrate below .",
    "this root is real as long as the bulk curve s tangent geodesics have @xmath85 .",
    "however , choosing the smallest positive root does have a consequence : the maximum turning radius we can produce from this smallest root is @xmath86 the astute reader will notice that this maximum radius is smaller than the maximum in .",
    "regardless , we now impose the smaller maximum , and show that reconstruction works for bulk curves whose tangent geodesics and radius satisfy @xmath87 .",
    "we will return to the case of larger radius in section  [ sec : badcurves ] below .",

    "in fact , from the endpoints at @xmath6 we can read off the family of boundary intervals necessary to reconstruct the bulk curve : @xmath90    as in an asymptotically ads spacetime , the length of such a boundary - anchored geodesic diverges in lifshitz spacetime .",
    "we introduce a simple radial cut - off at @xmath91 to regulate this divergence : @xmath92 where we used to obtain the final line .",
    "it is not clear how to interpret the length of this geodesic in the dual field theory . as mentioned earlier ,",
    "when @xmath93 we simply recover the ads result , so it is tempting to identify this as the entanglement entropy _  la _ ryu - takayanagi .",
    "this independence from @xmath4 is a bit surprising in itself .",
    "there is some supporting evidence from field theory calculations featuring lifshitz symmetry : both @xcite and @xcite recover an area law , though the former observes an additional sub - leading divergence .",
    "however , these two different setups both have more symmetry than we do .",
    "even aside from this possible concern , we are left with a further question : when the interval does not lie on a constant - time slice , what are we computing ?",
    "we do not have a physical understanding of this boundary quantity .",
    "for both of these reasons , it is still unclear what is the meaningful entanglement entropy calculation in a lifshitz field theory .",
    "for now we simply assume that the length of this geodesic computes the entanglement entropy according to @xmath94 .",
    "we will see that the regulatory cut - off drops out in this construction .",
    "we now have all the ingredients we need to evaluate the differential entropy , defined in .",
    "it is useful to rewrite this as @xmath95}{\\partial \\lambda ' } \\right|_{\\lambda'=\\lambda } = \\int_0 ^ 1 d\\lambda\\ , \\frac{\\partial s(\\gamma_-,\\gamma_+)}{\\partial \\gamma_+^{{m}}}\\ , \\frac{d \\gamma_+^{{m}}}{d\\lambda } .\\ ] ] we know @xmath96 , but would need to invert and to obtain @xmath97 .",
    "however , since we only need its derivative in , we can use the chain rule and implicit differentiation . from translation invariance in @xmath98 and",
    "@xmath13 we can express the length as @xmath99 .",
    "we evaluate the partial derivatives the hard way using , and : @xmath100 our results seem surprisingly simple at first . however , as pointed out in the proof given by @xcite , the simple explanation is that these are the hamilton - jacobi equations from @xmath101 .",
    "we now use and to express our derivative as a function of @xmath44 : @xmath102.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total derivative term drops out of the integral in due to the periodic boundary conditions on @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we do indeed recover the length , or gravitational entropy , of the bulk curve .",
    "in conclusion , the differential entropy construction worked just as in asymptotically ads spacetime , despite the lack of field theory interpretation for the length of a geodesic with endpoints at different times .",
    "furthermore , the cut - off we introduced dropped out .    whilst we considered the simplest non - trivial example of a time - dependent curve",
    ", the general result of @xcite will still hold for some more general bulk curves .",
    "however , in the following section we will see that there exist curves for which it does not .",
    "in @xcite it is also claimed that the bulk curve emerges from the intersection of neighboring entanglement wedges .",
    "we will comment on this in the context of lifshitz spacetime in section  [ sec : discussion ] .      despite the success of the differential entropy construction for curves at the constant radii given in ( [ eq : ustar ] )",
    ", we will now show that some bulk curves can not be built in this manner , because the extremal surfaces necessary to do so never reach the boundary .",
    "thus , they have no endpoints on the boundary and can not trace out boundary curves from which to define the differential entropy .",
    "the simplest such bulk curves are as above : they have constant radius but can vary in time as we move along the @xmath13 direction , as long as they stay spacelike",
    ". we again want to find a family of spacelike geodesics tangent to the curve , necessarily at the radial turning points of the geodesics . to be specific , equations ( [ eq : gammab ] ) through ( [ eq : poflambda ] ) still apply .",
    "however , as we highlighted above , in the case of @xmath83 the maximum radius bulk curve we can describe using the smallest positive root in the turning point condition is ( [ eq : umax ] ) , while requiring the bulk curve to be spacelike only necessitates ( [ eq : spacelikepe ] ) .",
    "there is a mismatch here : what about bulk curves of constant radius between @xmath103 and @xmath74 ? ) and ( [ eq : poflambda ] ) , so instead we are worried about bulk curves at constant radius that have at least one tangent with @xmath103 smaller than their constant radius @xmath72 .",
    "] clearly there are tangent spacelike geodesics , because ( [ eq : spacelikepe ] ) is satisfied .",
    "so what goes wrong with ( [ eq : umax ] ) ?",
    "that maximum radius was found assuming we took the smallest positive root of the turning point equation for the tangent geodesic .",
    "if we instead take the larger positive root , the maximum radius now becomes just @xmath74 . at any larger radius , a curve with tangents governed by @xmath73",
    "would be timelike so not within our construction .    however , we chose the smallest positive root because those geodesics start and end on the spacetime boundary .",
    "a geodesic whose turning point occurs at the larger positive root instead ends at a singularity : either the tidal singularity in vacuum lifshitz , or a black hole singularity .",
    "importantly , spacelike geodesics that do not end on the boundary can not participate in the differential entropy construction .    to check that geodesics whose turning points occur at larger radii than in ( [ eq : umax ] ) do not reach the boundary , we consider the concavity of the geodesic , given by @xmath104 . when @xmath105 at a turning point , the geodesics bends towards the boundary there .",
    "when @xmath106 at a turning point , then instead the geodesics return to larger radii .",
    "to find @xmath104 at a generic turning point , we take the derivative of ( [ eq : gengeodesics ] ) with respect to the affine parameter , finding @xmath107 where we have restored general @xmath4 .",
    "next , we use the turning point equation @xmath108 to eliminate either @xmath19 or @xmath20 from the expression @xmath109 .",
    "we find @xmath110 of course these are actually the same maximum possible @xmath111 , just expressed in a different way .",
    "consequently , although earlier we only exhibited the mismatch for @xmath83 , we now see the maximum radius for boundary - anchored spacelike geodesics for general @xmath4 obeys @xmath112 again , spacelike curves with @xmath73 exist up to @xmath72 satisfying ( [ eq : spacelikepe ] ) , but for these larger radii their tangent geodesics never reach the boundary .",
    "this failure of the differential entropy reconstruction is reminiscent of that shown in @xcite .",
    "the authors proved that spacetimes with certain types of ` holographic screens ' contain bulk surfaces that can not be reconstructed via this hole - olography approach ( even though extremal surfaces can reach the bulk surfaces in question ) .",
    "as we exhibit in appendix [ appendix : screens ] , lifshitz spacetime contains surfaces similar to holographic screens ; these surfaces , caused because light rays with non - zero momentum turn around in lifshitz spacetimes , are in fact indicative of the explicit failure we have just shown .",
    "our situation is actually slightly worse than that shown in the horizon - having spacetimes of @xcite . in lifshitz spacetime , by choosing a spacelike curve whose tangent somewhere has arbitrarily small @xmath74 , we can draw a bulk spacelike curve arbitrarily close to the boundary whose tangent geodesics will never reach the boundary .",
    "there are non - reconstructible constant radius bulk curves everywhere in the spacetime .",
    "in this section we consider a construction based on a proper subset of ( a cauchy slice of ) the boundary : the causal wedge .",
    "consider first an asymptotically ads spacetime and focus on a spacelike co - dimension one boundary region @xmath113 with boundary domain of dependence @xmath114 .",
    "the bulk causal wedge @xmath115 is the intersection of the causal past and the causal future of @xmath114 .",
    "its boundary in the bulk is generated by null geodesics that end on the boundary of @xmath114 .",
    "given the knowledge of the reduced density matrix in @xmath113 , it was argued in @xcite that one should be able to reconstruct at least the corresponding bulk causal wedge in the dual spacetime    in an asymptotically ads spacetime , we only have to send null geodesics from the future- and past - most tips of @xmath114 in order to obtain a wedge that is a closed subset of the bulk .",

    "the differential entropy approach to building spacelike bulk curves succeeds for constant radius curves , when the bulk curve has tangents satisfying . indeed , even the cut - off necessary to define the differential entropy drops out of the final result .",

    "however both the height and the bulk depth of the wedge shrink to zero as we remove the cut - off .",

    "the light - sheets from the holographic entanglement extremal surface do not reach the boundary and thus do not enclose a bulk region . continuing the light - sheets past caustics",

    "an interval of width @xmath116 in lif@xmath9 with @xmath83 , the light rays have momentum as high as @xmath241 , which corresponds to a geodesic that turns around at @xmath242 , so a small cut - off alone can not close the wedge .",
    "instead , we must additionally include light - sheets emanating from the boundary region @xmath113 : these light - sheets combined with those from the extremal surface @xmath199 do form a closed subregion of the bulk .",
    "this change in the formation of the entanglement wedge does not alter the identification of intersections of entanglement wedges with the spacelike curve reconstructed via the differential entropy , as mentioned at the end of section  [ sec : differentialentropy ] .",
    "although the light - sheets emanating from a single extremal surface do not enclose a bulk subregion , a pair of neighboring light - sheets still may .",
    "however , the change in the formation of the entanglement wedge does indicate a concern regarding the hrt proposal in a lifshitz spacetime .",
    "one justification of this proposal begins with a series of past and future light - sheets that asymptotically approach the past and future of the boundary causal diamond ; where each pair of light sheets intersects , hrt define a candidate surface . among these candidate surfaces ,",
    "their proposal picks out the surface that extremizes its area , as justified by the bousso entropy bound . in the lifshitz case , it is still possible to construct many light - sheets that do asymptote to the boundary causal diamond in asymptotically lifshitz spacetime ; however the light - sheets emanating from the spacelike geodesic corresponding to the ryu - takayangi or hrt proposal are not in this class . if we insist on considering light - sheets that asymptote to the boundary causal domain , we would then need another prescription to decide between the many possible light - sheets .",
    "we have limited our discussion here to vacuum lifshitz spacetimes in three dimensions . for the differential entropy ,",
    "this means both that we study only spacelike geodesics rather than higher - dimensional extremal surfaces , and also that there is only one spacelike geodesic homologous to a given boundary region . from our experience with non - vacuum ads spacetimes",
    ", we expect that considering instead just asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes may require choosing between two ( or more ) extremal surfaces .    for the causal wedge",
    ", our restriction to three dimensions means that the boundary domain of dependence is fairly trivial : domains of dependence in two dimensions are necessarily composed entirely of causal diamonds . in higher dimensions",
    "the boundary domain may be more complicated , but we do not believe this will alter our result ; we will still require a cut - off surface in order to define a non - degenerate wedge , but with a cut - off the construction should be successful",
    ".    we are left with many unresolved questions .",
    "first , naive application of the ryu - takayanagi proposal to lifshitz spacetimes may not be justified ; there are few field theory calculations to compare to",
    ". the lack of dependence on the dynamical exponent @xmath4 in the vacuum could be physical but may also be indicative of a required modification of this proposal",
    ". it would be interesting to see if the justification of this proposal given in @xcite can be extended to asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes .    in order to study dependence on @xmath4",
    "more thoroughly we could consider boundary regions of non - constant time , defined on a cut - off surface .",
    "however it is unclear to us what meaning an entanglement entropy on such a region would have in the boundary field theory , much less that said quantity should be associated with the area of a homologous extremal surface .",
    "in fact , if we wish to consider boundary regions at something other than constant @xmath98 , we should instead consider the field theory symmetry algebra directly , rather than just inheriting the relativistic bulk symmetry at a cut - off surface ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps a galilean boosted region might be more interesting to consider .",
    "we should note that the lack of physical interpretation in the boundary field theory for the entanglement entropy of a boosted region means that even curves that can be successfully reconstructed via a differential entropy approach have not really been built from boundary information ; or rather , we do not understand the physical boundary information required to compute the length of such curves if they are not on a constant time slice .",
    "this problem , coupled with the lack of field - theoretic calculations for lifshitz field theories , also precludes using the variational approach of @xcite to rebuild lifshitz spacetime .",
    "given the differences between lifshitz and ads that we have exhibited here , we expect that other entanglement - reconstruction ides , including universal properties of entanglement reconstruction @xcite and entanglement holography @xcite , will also be altered when studied for non - relativistic duals .    even outside of the question of asymptotically lifshitz spacetimes , some of our results also affect asymptotically ads spacetimes , provided they have a lifshitz - like interior .",
    "for example , reconstruction of bulk curves deep in a lifshitz - like region may fail due to a lack of boundary - anchored extremal surfaces .",
    "such problems may additionally generalize to other spacetimes with light rays that do not reach the boundary , such as black holes in ads .",
    "this possible generalization , which remains to be explored fully , is evidenced by the connection between our work and that of @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to explore the relationship between boundary and bulk causality in an asymptotically lifshitz spacetime . in asymptotically ads spacetimes , the gravitational time - delay theorem of gao and wald  @xcite implies that bulk causality agrees with boundary causality for local cft observables .",
    "( in brief : a signal connecting two boundary points can not propagate more quickly through the bulk than along the boundary . )",
    "it was proven in  @xcite that the hrt prescription for entanglement entropy ( a non - local quantity ) also satisfies this basic consistency requirement .",
    "both results assume that the bulk obeys the null energy condition . whilst many theories admitting asymptotically lifshitz solutions satisfy this condition , the degeneracy of the lifshitz boundary and its presumed non - relativistic dual makes this issue very different to the ads case .",
    "one possible in - road to this subject is to study the lieb - robinson bound  @xcite on the speed of entanglement propagation for non - relativistic systems holographically .",
    "there is a stronger possible interpretation of the difficulties with bulk reconstruction in lifshitz spacetimes : perhaps they arise not from problems with holographic entanglement entropy prescriptions , but instead because we are attempting to construct the wrong spacetime . in order to reconstruct a bulk dual geometry to non - relativistic theories ,",
    "perhaps we should begin by studying the boundary symmetries , viewing the field theory in a newton - cartan approach as in @xcite .",
    "then we may hope to construct a new spacetime dual that we are able to more fully reconstruct , as done for warped cfts in @xcite .",

    "additionally , we use lemma 2 from @xcite to show that spacelike geodesics with radii above ( [ eq : umaxgenz ] ) never reach a smaller @xmath35 and thus can not touch the boundary or participate in the hole - ography approach .    to define a holographic screen , @xcite begin with a null foliation of ( a region of ) the spacetime , defined via the foliation s null generator @xmath243 .",

    "it is a future holographic screen if @xmath250 , and a past holographic screen if @xmath251 . in our case below , however , we will find @xmath244 and @xmath249 vanish at the same location .",
    "even though the theorems in @xcite are not applicable because both @xmath244 and @xmath249 vanish at the same location , we can still use lemma 2 ( conveniently applicable in 2 + 1 dimensions ! ) to show that geodesics with turning radii between ( [ eq : umaxgenz ] ) and the spacelike limit @xmath252 can not reach the boundary .",
    "lemma 2 shows that in a region of a null congruence with @xmath253 , for a given leaf @xmath248 of the associated foliation , any spacelike geodesic @xmath254 that is tangent to the leaf @xmath248 at a point @xmath255 has some neighborhood @xmath256 such that @xmath257 is nowhere to the past of  @xmath248 .",

    "we will not need it here .",
    "instead , we now compute @xmath244 by first defining the reduced induced metric @xmath266 : @xmath267 and then computing @xmath268 similarly for the expansion of @xmath246 we find @xmath269 in both cases , the @xmath247 , where @xmath270 , occur at constant radius @xmath271 given by @xmath272 note for @xmath273 , the expansion @xmath244 becomes negative for @xmath274 .",
