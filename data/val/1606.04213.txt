    "a fragmentation function contains important information on the strong dynamics of producing a hadron in high - energy scattering process .",
    "it describes the probability of a parton to emit mesons with certain fractions of the parent parton momentum , and serves as a crucial input to a framework for hadron production based on factorization theorem .",
    "for example , one needs unpolarized fragmentation functions for the analysis of semi - inclusive deeply inelastic scattering , electron - positron annihilation into hadrons , and hadron hadroproduction @xcite .",
    "quark fragmentation functions in the low energy limit have been calculated in effective models recently , such as the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite and the nonlocal chiral quark model @xcite .",
    "a concern is that gluon fragmentation functions are assumed to be null at a model scale , due to the absence of gluonic degrees of freedom in the corresponding lagrangians .",
    "a gluon can certainly fragment into hadrons at a low scale , just like a quark does . without the gluon fragmentation functions at a model scale , qcd evolution effects can not be complete , and the resultant quark fragmentation functions at a high scale are not reliable .",
    "a simple argument is as follows .",
    "the quark fragmentation function @xmath2 of a hadron @xmath3 with a momentum fraction @xmath4 obeys the sum rule @xmath5 for 100% quark light - cone momentum transfer to hadrons at a model scale .",
    "setting the gluon fragmentation function @xmath6 to zero will violate the sum rule @xmath7 , so the quark and gluon fragmentation functions invalidate the sum rules after qcd evolution .",
    "in this paper we attempt to derive the gluon fragmentation functions in the njl model . though there are lack of gluonic degrees of freedom , we regard a gluon as a pair of color lines formed by fictitious quark and anti - quark ( @xmath0 ) in a color - octet state .",
    "a requirement is that the @xmath0 pair remains flavor - singlet after meson emissions .",
    "namely , the quark @xmath8 emits a hadron @xmath9 and the anti - quark @xmath10 emits an anti - hadron @xmath11 at the same time , resulting in a flavor - singlet fictitious @xmath12 pair .",
    "the idea originates from the color dipole model , in which a gluon is treated as a pair of color lines , and parton emissions are turned into emissions of color dipoles composed of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "the simplest version of our proposal leads to the formulation of the gluon fragmentation functions in terms of the quark fragmentation functions , similar to that in the lund model @xcite .",
    "a refined version is to include the mechanism of quark annihilation , which respects the flavor - singlet requirement on the @xmath0 pair , such that the specific flavor of the fictitious quarks is irrelevant .",
    "gluon elementary fragmentation functions in the refined version are constructed from the quark and anti - quark elementary fragmentation functions for emitting specific mesons in one step .",
    "an integral equation , which iterates the gluon elementary fragmentation functions to all orders , is then solved to yield the gluon fragmentation functions .    it will be verified that our results are stable with respect to variation of relevant model parameters , including the model scales and the fictitious quark masses , especially after qcd evolution to a higher scale is implemented . the possible effect from branching of a gluon into more , i.e. , from the multi - dipole contribution , is also investigated , and found to be minor . with the gluon and quark fragmentation functions obtained in this paper , we predict the @xmath13 differential cross section at the scale @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the @xmath16 boson mass , and compare it with the measured ones , such as those from tasso @xcite , tpc @xcite , hrs @xcite , topaz @xcite , sld @xcite , aleph @xcite , opal @xcite , and delphi @xcite . since the above data are similar , we will focus on the sld one .",
    "it will be demonstrated , as an appropriate model scale is chosen , that the inclusion of the gluon fragmentation functions into the predictions from only the quark fragmentation functions greatly improves the agreement with the sld data for the pion and kaon productions .",
    "this work explores the behavior of the gluon fragmentation functions at low energy , and their importance on phenomenological applications .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review the evaluation of the quark fragmentation functions in the njl model in sec .",
    "the color dipole model is briefly introduced in sec .",
    "iii , which motivates our proposal to treat a gluon as a pair of color lines .",
    "the gluon fragmentation functions are then formulated in the simple version , which is consistent with the lund model , and in the refined version , which includes the quark annihilation mechanism and the multi - dipole contribution .",
    "numerical results of the gluon fragmentation functions for the pion and kaon , before and after the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) qcd evolution , are presented .",
    "these results are compared to the hirai - kumano - nagai - sudoh ( hkns ) @xcite and de florian - sassot - stratmann ( dss ) @xcite parameterizations of the quark and gluon fragmentation functions in sec .",
    "iv , and then to the sld data of the @xmath13 differential cross sections at @xmath14 .",
    "section v contains the conclusion .",
    "some numerical results from the leading - order ( lo ) qcd evolution are collected in the appendix for reference .",
    "the njl model @xcite is a low - energy effective theory , like the bcs theory , to demonstrate the chiral symmetry breaking and appearance of nambu - goldstone bosons .",
    "a non - vanishing chiral condensate would be generated as the coupling of the four - fermion interaction is greater than a critical value .",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking then gives rise to dynamical quark mass from a gap equation .",
    "the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking also induces massless nambu - goldstone bosons , represented by the pole of the summation of fermion loops to all orders in the four - fermion coupling , and regarded as quark - antiquark excitations of the spontaneously broken vacuum . to get massive nambu - goldstone bosons ,",
    "one adds a bare fermion mass term , i.e. , explicit chiral symmetry breaking , into the effective theory .",
    "the njl model has been applied to the calculation of quark distribution functions @xcite and fragmentation functions @xcite for massive pseudoscalar mesons .    in this section",
    "we briefly review the derivation of quark fragmentation functions for pseudoscalar mesons in the njl model , which starts with the construction of an elementary fragmentation function @xmath17 .",
    "this function represents the probability of a quark @xmath8 to emit a meson @xmath18 in one step , which carries a light - cone momentum fraction @xmath4 of the quark momentum in the minus direction , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in the light - cone frame",
    "the quark possesses vanishing transverse momentum before the emission , and nonzero @xmath19 with respect to the direction of the emitted meson .",
    "the elementary quark fragmentation function has been computed as @xcite @xmath20\\\\ & \\times \\delta(k_--p_-/z ) 2\\pi \\delta((k - p)^2-m_2 ^ 2)\\\\ = & \\frac{c_q^m}{2 } g_{mqq}^2 \\frac{z}{2}{\\int}\\frac{d^2p_\\perp}{(2\\pi)^3}\\frac{p_\\perp^2+[(z-1)m_1-m_2]^2 } { [ p_\\perp^2+z(z-1)m_1 ^ 2+zm_2 ^ 2+(1-z)m_m^2]^2},\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\label{dqm}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is a flavor factor , @xmath22 denotes the quark propagator , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the quark constituent masses before and after the emission , respectively , and @xmath25 is the meson mass .",
    "the dipole regulator in @xcite has been employed to avoid a divergence in the above integral .",
    "the quark - meson coupling @xmath26 is determined via the quark - bubble graph @xcite : @xmath27,\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the number of colors @xmath28 .",
    "we adopt the values @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the couplings , @xmath31 gev and @xmath32 gev for the quark constituent masses , and @xmath33 gev and @xmath34 gev for the meson masses .",
    "the curves of @xmath35 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] indicate that the probability for emitting a meson with a vanishing momentum is tiny , and the meson which can be directly formed from the quark @xmath8 in one step , such as the @xmath36 and @xmath37 channels , prefers a momentum fraction as high as @xmath38 - 0.8 . since a kaon is more massive than a pion , it tends to carry a bit larger momentum fraction @xmath4 .",
    "these features will help understanding our numerical results for the gluon fragmentation functions to be evaluated in the next section .",
    "the integral equation based on a multiplicative ansatz for a fragmentation function is written as @xcite @xmath39 where the elementary fragmentation function has been normalized into @xmath40 in order to have the meaning of probability .",
    "equation  ( [ dqm ] ) , which iterates eq .",
    "( [ dqm ] ) to all orders , determines the probability of emitting a meson @xmath18 by the quark @xmath8 with a momentum fraction @xmath4 through a jet process : the first term @xmath41 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ dqm ] ) corresponds to the first emission of the meson @xmath9 in the jet process , and the second term , containing a convolution , collects the contribution from the rest of meson emissions in the jet process described by @xmath42 with the probability @xmath43 .",
    "equation  ( [ dqm ] ) can be solved in at least three different ways to get the quark fragmentation functions , by iteration , by inverse matrix inversion , and by monte carlo simulation . here",
    "we take the former two methods , and have confirmed that the results are the same . the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 at a model scale is exhibited in fig .",
    "it is found that the quark fragmentation functions will have peaks in the high @xmath4 region , if the mesons can be formed directly from the quarks ( referred to the discussion on fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , such as the @xmath47 and @xmath37 channels . otherwise , the mesons come from the secondary emissions , and the corresponding fragmentation functions are larger at low @xmath4 .",
    "it is expected that the @xmath48 channel has a smaller probability than the @xmath36 one does , because a kaon is more massive .",
    "the same explanation applies to the comparison of the @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) channels .",
    "due to the absence of the gluonic degrees of freedom at the lagrangian level in the njl model , a gluon fragmentation function can not be computed directly .",
    "as stated in the introduction , we propose to derive this fragmentation function by treating a gluon as a pair of color lines formed by fictitious quark and anti - quark ( @xmath0 ) in a color - octet state .",
    "the idea originates form the color dipole model developed by gustafson and andersson in 80 s @xcite .",
    "the large @xmath28 limit is assumed in this model , under which parton emissions are turned into emissions of color dipoles composed of quarks and anti - quarks in , for instance , a shower process .",
    "the color dipole model has been also extended to handle onium - onium scattering at high energy @xcite , for which a high energy onium state , consisting of numerous @xmath53 pairs and soft gluons , is regarded as a collection of color dipoles in the large @xmath28 limit .",
    "the result has been compared with that from the formalism with balitskii - fadin - kuraev - lipatov pomerons @xcite .",
    "a requirement is that the fictitious @xmath0 pair remains flavor - singlet after meson emissions , which can be achieved by the simultaneous emissions of @xmath9 and @xmath11 as illustrated in fig .",
    "that is , if the @xmath54 quark of the @xmath55 pair fragments a @xmath56 meson , the @xmath57 quark of the pair must fragment a @xmath58 meson .",
    "the @xmath59 pair after the @xmath56 and @xmath58 emissions remains in the flavor - singlet state , and then repeats meson emissions .",
    "applying fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] to generate the jet process , we write the resultant gluon fragmentation functions @xmath60 as a combination of the fragmentation functions @xmath61 from the quark and @xmath62 from the anti - quark , @xmath63dx , \\end{aligned}\\label{dglm}\\ ] ] for @xmath64 in @xmath65 and @xmath66 in @xmath67 .",

    "the average over the three fictitious quark flavors @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 has been made explicit . because @xmath74 is defined for an initial quark @xmath8 with 100% momentum to fragment mesons , its argument should be rescaled , leading to @xmath75 and @xmath76 in eq .",

    "we explain why all the gluon fragmentation functions decrease with @xmath4 by taking the fragmentation into the @xmath56 meson as an example : the major contributions of @xmath83 arise from the high @xmath4 region , which is suppressed by the phase space @xmath84 in eq .",

    "we have demonstrated that the inclusion of the gluon fragmentation functions into the theoretical predictions from only the quark fragmentation functions greatly improves the agreement with the sld data for the pion and kaon productions in @xmath1 annihilation at the scale @xmath14 .",
    "especially , our predictions for the pion emission from the nlo evolution are well consistent with the sld data , and with the hkns and dss parameterizations .",
    "this nontrivial consistency implies that our proposal may have provided a plausible construct for the gluon fragmentation functions , which are supposed to be null in the njl model .",
    "the framework presented in this paper is ready for a generalization to the quark and gluon fragmentation functions for other pseudoscalar mesons , such as @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "wide applications are expected .",
    "the heavy - quark ( charm and bottom ) fragmentation functions should be included for a complete qcd evolution to @xmath129 as high as @xmath130 , which have been taken into account in the hkns and dss parameterizations .",
    "how to establish the heavy - quark fragmentation functions in an effective model is another challenging and important mission .",
    "we will address these subjects in future works .",
    "we collect some results from the lo evolution in this appendix .",
    "figure  [ fig19 ] displays the similarity of the quark and gluon fragmentation functions from the the three different schemes , namely , the scheme consistent with the lund model , the scheme including the quark annihilation mechanism , and the scheme including the multi - dipole contribution , under the lo evolution .",
    "this similarity supports the consideration of only the scheme with the quark annihilation mechanism .",
    "our results for the quark and gluon fragmentation functions are compared with the hkns and dss parameterizations at the scales @xmath124 gev@xmath120 and @xmath14 under the lo evolution in figs .",
    "[ fig23]-[fig29 ] .",
    "similar to the observation drawn from the nlo evolution , the obvious difference between the curves labeled by `` njl with g '' and by `` njl without g '' indicates the importance of the gluon fragmentation functions .",
    "for any quark or gluon to the @xmath56 meson channels , the `` njl with g '' results agree better with the hkns and dss ones than the `` njl without g '' results do at @xmath124 gev@xmath120 and @xmath135 in the almost entire region of @xmath4 . for the @xmath118 meson channels ,",
    "it is hard to tell which curves , `` njl with g '' or `` njl without g '' are closer to the hkns and dss ones .",
    "again , all the curves are more distinct in the low @xmath4 region .",
