    "since hydrogen is one of the best clean fuels in the future , looking for an ideal storage material has become an important task for experimental and theoretical researchers . among all the candidates , magnesium ( mg ) based materials are widely concerned because they are relatively inexpensive and can hold a high weight percentage of hydrogen @xcite .",
    "so the interaction between hydrogen and mg has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "the main disadvantage that prevents the vast applications of mg for hydrogen storage lies in that the corresponding hydrogenation and dehydrogenation temperatures are large @xcite .",
    "recently , it is found that the aluminum ( al ) doped mgal thin films have much lower hydrogenation temperatures than pure mg films @xcite .",
    "however , the specific reason for the improvement as well as the influence of al doping on the electronic properties of mg films , remains unclear .",
    "so , in order to advance the searches for ideal hydrogen storage materials and applications of hydrogen fuels , it become quite important to make clear the influence of al doping on the electronic structure of mg and the the interaction between hydrogen and mg .",
    "apart from the potential usages in hydrogen storage , mgal alloys are also important industrial materials used in aerospace applications @xcite .",
    "it is always believed that the al doping makes mg more resistent to being corrupted by air .",
    "so lots of efforts have been applied to upgrade the manufacturing techniques to dope al in mg materials , and now the technology has become quite mature .",
    "studying the interactions between small molecules and al - doped mg surfaces can give us critical information about the mechanisms for al doping to improve the resistance of mg to corruption , and thus are very meaningful and necessary .",
    "based on this background and the requirements of hydrogen storage materials , we here perform first principles calculations to systematically study the influence of al doping on the electronic properties of the mg(0001 ) surface and the adsorption behavior of hydrogen molecules .",
    "previous studies have revealed that the mg(0001 ) surface has both considerable @xmath1 and @xmath2 electronic states distributing around the fermi energy , because of the @xmath3 hybridizations @xcite .",
    "here we further find that after doping of an al atom , the electronic structures around the fermi energy mainly distribute around the doping layer .",
    "for the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the clean mg(0001 ) surface , it has been found that the most energetically favored site is the surface bridge site @xcite , with the corresponding minimum energy barrier of 0.85 ev @xcite . through our present first - principles calculations , we find that al - doping will not change the most energetically favored dissociation channel .",
    "however , the minimum energy barrier for dissociation of hydrogen is critically dependent on the doping depth of al , and the values are all larger than that on the clean mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our fist - principles calculation method and the models used in this paper . in sec .",
    "iii , we present in detail our calculated results , including the comparisons of the electronic structures of the mg(0001 ) surface before and after al doping , and the dissociation of hydrogen molecules on the al - doped mg(0001 ) surface . at",
    "last , the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "our calculations are performed within density functional theory ( dft ) using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the pw91 @xcite generalized gradient approximation and the projector - augmented wave potential @xcite are employed to describe the exchange - correlation energy and the electron - ion interaction , respectively .",
    "the cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion is set to 250 ev , which is large enough to make the calculational error of the adsorption energy below 0.01 ev .",
    "the clean and al - doped mg(0001 ) surface are modeled by a slab composing of five atomic layers and a vacuum region of 20  .",
    "the @xmath4 supercell in which each monolayer contains four mg atoms are adopted in the study of the h@xmath0 adsorption .",
    "our test calculations have shown that the @xmath4 supercell is sufficiently large to avoid the interaction between adjacent hydrogen molecules .",
    "integration over the brillouin zone is done using the monkhorst - pack scheme @xcite with @xmath5 grid points .",
    "a fermi broadening @xcite of 0.1 ev is chosen to smear the occupation of the bands around the fermi energy ( e@xmath6 ) by a finite-@xmath7 fermi function and extrapolating to @xmath8 k. during geometry optimizations , the bottom layer of the clean and al - doped mg(0001 ) surface is fixed while other mg and al atoms are free to relax until the forces on them are less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the calculation of the potential energy surface for molecular h@xmath0 is interpolated to 209 points with different bond length ( @xmath9 ) and height ( @xmath10 ) of h@xmath11 at each surface site . the calculated lattice constant of bulk mg ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) and the bond length of a free h@xmath11 molecule are 3.21  , 5.15    and 0.75  , respectively , in good agreement with the experimental values of 3.21  , 5.20   @xcite and 0.74   @xcite .",
    "as shown in fig . 1 , we have employed 3 different doping depths for al in the mg(0001 ) surface , with the al atom respectively in the first ( mgal1 ) , second ( mgal2 ) and third monolayer ( mgal3 ) .",
    "for the clean mg(0001 ) surface , our calculations reveal that the distances between the three topmost atomic layers are expanded from their bulk values , in accordance with previous theoretical @xcite and experimental reports @xcite .",
    "it is because that due to its special surface charge redistribution , the topmost three layers of the mg(0001 ) surface are negatively charged and hence repel each other .",
    "in fact , the surface expansion is a special phenomena for the mg(0001 ) surface , which is not seen for other surfaces of mg @xcite . and instead of expansions , the surface relaxations of many metals show contractions @xcite . the relaxation calculation for the clean mg(0001 ) surface also confirms the precise of our methods .",
    "however , after the doping of an al atom , the surface relaxation is changed . to describe more clearly the changes , here",
    "we define the surface relaxation as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the distance between the @xmath17th and @xmath18th layer of the relaxed surface , and the lattice spacing along the ( 0001 ) direction of bulk mg .",
    "table i summarizes the calculated relaxations for the clean mg(0001 ) , mgal1 , mgal2 , and mgal3 surfaces .",
    "we can easily see from table i that the results critically depend on the doping length of the al atom .",
    "if the al atom is doped at the first ( i.e. the topmost ) layer , then the distance between the first and second layers is contracted by 3.00 % . and",
    "if the al atom is doped at the second layer , then @xmath19 and @xmath20 respectively decreases by 2.60 % and 2.12 % .",
    "one can see that for the layer containing the doped al atom , the lattice spacings with its nearest mg layers are decreased a lot from that of bulk mg .",
    "this result is confirmed by the relaxation results of the mgal3 surface , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are decreased by 2.25 % and 2.12 % . by analyzing the atomic charges , we find that the neighboring mg atoms always lose electrons to the doped al atom .",
    "so the charging state of the doping layer and its neighboring mg layers are respectively negative and positive , and the interactions between them become attracting forces . thus the surface relaxation changes from expansion of the clean mg(0001 ) surface to the contraction after al doping .",
    ".surface relaxations ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 and work function ( @xmath25 ) of the mg(0001 ) , mgal1 , mgal2 , and mgal3 surfaces .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tableii ]    for the dissociation of h@xmath0 molecules on most metal surfaces , it has been revealed that two different interactions exist , which are respectively the orthogonalizations between molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 and electronic states of metal , and the charge transfer from metal atoms to hydrogen atoms @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we find that the al - doping did not change the metallic properties of the mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "so such two different interactions still exist for the dissociation of h@xmath0 on the mgal1 surface .    /mgal1",
    "system with the height of h@xmath0 to be 2.00 ( a ) and 0.92    ( b ) .",
    "mg , al , and h atoms are shown in grey , dark grey , and red balls respectively .",
    "all the values are in unit of electrons per @xmath26.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    figures 6(a ) and ( b ) respectively show the difference electron density for the adsorption system of h@xmath0/mgal1 before ( @xmath27=2.00  ) and after ( @xmath10=0.92  ) the transition state along the bri-@xmath28 channel , namely , @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the electron density of the adsorption system , the h@xmath0 molecule and the mgal1 surface . to calculate @xmath33 , the atomic positions in the last two terms in eq .",
    "2 have been kept at those of the first term . through careful wavefunction analysis",
    ", we find that at the beginning of the adsorption process , the molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 orthogonalize with electronic states of the mgal1 surface and are thus broadened .",
    "this orthogonalization is very similar to that has been observed during the interaction of h@xmath0 with the mg(0001 ) @xcite and al(111 ) @xcite surfaces . as shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) , there is an electron - depletion region on top of the al atom , which is formed because electrons around the al atom are repelled by the h@xmath0 bonding electrons due to the orthogonalization . in comparison , on the clean mg(0001 ) surface",
    ", the electrons of mg are repelled from the surface at the beginning of the adsorption of a h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "6(b ) that the h@xmath0 molecule begins to get some electrons from the mg and al atoms , when it gets more closer to the mgal1 surface .    as we have already seen , extra electrons on the mgal1 surface trends to distribute around the al atom .",
    "thus during the initial stage of the adsorption of a h@xmath0 molecule , the molecular orbitals of h@xmath0 orthogonalize only with electronic states around the al atom , while on the clean mg surface , the molecular orbitals orthogonalize with electronic states around the two nearest mg atoms . besides , the ability to lose electrons is stronger for a mg atom than an al atom . therefore , the h@xmath0 molecule is more difficult to get electrons from the mgal1 surface .",
    "and so the dissociation energy barrier is larger on the mgal1 surface .",
    "in summary , the electronic structures of the al - doped mg(0001 ) surfaces and the dissociation behaviors of h@xmath0 molecules on the doped surfaces are systematically studied , using the first - principles calculations .",
    "our calculational results show that after al - doping , the surface electronic structure is largely changed . due to the electrons redistribution , the surface relaxation changes from expansion to contraction around the doping layer . for different doping lengths , the work function of the mg(0001 ) surface",
    "are all enlarged . through careful electronic structure analysis , we further find that the electronic states around the fermi energy mainly distribute around the doping layer for al - doped mg(0001 ) surface . by calculating the potential energy surface of a h@xmath0 molecule on the al - doped mg(0001 ) surfaces , we find that the doping of an al atom does not change the dissociation path with the lowest energy barrier , but enlarges the energy barrier . and",
    "for the first layer doping , the energy barrier is changed by 0.30 ev . from wavefunction and charge - density analysis",
    ", we reveal the two interaction stages during the dissociation of the h@xmath0 molecule , i.e. the first orthogonalization and later charge - transfer stages .",
    "we find that because more surface electrons distribute around the al atom , the orthogonalization mainly happens between the h@xmath0 molecule and the surface al atom .",
    "in addition , since al atom has a weaker ability to lose electrons , the dissociation energy barrier for h@xmath0 is enlarged on the mgal1 surface than on a clean mg(0001 ) surface .",
    "our studies provide a detailed mechanism for explaining the improvement on the resistance to corrosion for the mg(0001 ) surface by doping of al atoms ."
