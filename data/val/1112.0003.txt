    "if the scalar sector contains colored fields , there are two basic cases - either the scalars can couple to fermions or they can not .",
    "if their gauge quantum numbers forbid couplings to fermions , then in order to enable the new scalars to decay they must be in a real representation of the color gauge group , which allows a cubic coupling in the scalar potential .",
    "the lowest dimensional real representation is a color octet . on the other hand ,",
    "if the new colored scalars can couple to fermions , then one wants to impose minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) to forbid tree - level flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "if the new scalars are singlets under the flavor group , then the only representation that can couple to fermions is a color octet .",
    "so there are a number of reasons to focus on the color octet representation .",
    "color octet scalars appear in many models of new physics currently tested at the lhc .",
    "the literature on the subject is vast , covering the case of @xmath0 singlets @xcite , as well as doublets @xcite and triplets @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of color octet scalars on the high transverse momenta four - jet cross section at the lhc .",
    "we note that the analysis of multijet events is very promising @xcite and may give clues about new physics in the near future .",
    "in the first part of the paper , we concentrate on color octet scalars with no weak quantum numbers . it is a simple extension of the standard model , naturally being anomaly - free and not affected by precision electroweak constraints .",
    "the second part concerns weak doublet color octet scalars , namely the manohar - wise model @xcite .",
    "our interest in @xmath1 doublets is motivated , in part , by the observation that the principal of mfv restricts gauge quantum numbers of any scalar sector coupled directly to quarks @xcite .",
    "the allowed quantum numbers are those of the standard model higgs doublet , or a color octet scalar with the higgs weak quantum numbers . in our analysis , we concentrate on cases with small couplings to quarks .    for both weak singlets and doublets ,",
    "we impose cuts on transverse momenta ( @xmath2 ) of the jets , which significantly reduces the standard model background . in the singlet case ,",
    "we implement also restrictions on the invariant mass of jet pairs .",
    "we find that , after performing such cuts , the color octet scalar contribution to the four - jet cross section at the lhc is significant in a large region of parameter space .",
    "furthermore , we identify other weak doublet scalar signatures , which may be used to distinguish the doublets from the singlets .",
    "however , for those additional processes involving weak doublets , the cross section depends also on other parameters in the scalar potential , which we keep fixed at certain values .",
    "we begin by investigating the standard model with the addition of @xmath1 singlet color octet scalars .",
    "such scalars are coupled to the standard model at tree - level only through the @xmath3 gauge sector , @xmath4 \\!=\\ !",
    "\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_{\\mu } s^a \\!-\\ !",
    "g_s f^{a b c } g_{\\mu}^b s^c)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the self - coupling term enabling the scalar decay is , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the scalar mass . the complete form of the scalar potential is given in ref.@xcite . constraints considered there yield @xmath7 .",
    "we are interested in the effects of color octet scalars on the process @xmath8 at the lhc .",
    "the cross section for such a process should be modified by the existence of the @xmath9 channel .",
    "there are four tree - level diagrams contributing to @xmath10 scattering ( figure [ fig : fd1 ] ) , while the scalar singlet decay , @xmath11 , occurs only through loop diagrams ( figure [ fig : fd2 ] ) .",
    "the effective scalar - gluon - gluon vertex can be calculated from the diagrams in figure [ fig : fd2 ] .",
    "the corresponding effective lagrangian term is , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "we note that decays of the weak singlet scalar to quarks ( and gluons ) can be induced by higher dimensional operators ( for a detailed discussion , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . however , in our analysis we assume that the effect of such operators is negligible .",
    "we expect the impact of @xmath0 singlet color octet scalars on the standard model cross section for the process @xmath14 to be especially pronounced for high @xmath2 four - jet events , where the background is highly suppressed .",
    "in addition , appropriate cuts on the invariant mass of jet pairs should further increase the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "our results are summarized in section iv a.",
    "the second part of the paper is focused on signatures involving @xmath0 doublet color octet scalars .",
    "the motivation for such scalars was outlined in the introduction . a thorough discussion is given in ref",
    ". @xcite . following this reference",
    ", we denote the new weak doublet scalar by , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the index of the adjoint color representation .",
    "one can split the neutral component of the new doublet into its real and imaginary parts , @xmath17 the tree - level masses are @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lagrangian mass parameter , @xmath20 are dimensionless parameters in the scalar potential , and @xmath21 is the vev of the standard model higgs . the full lagrangian is given in ref.@xcite .",
    "apart from the gauge coupling terms and the scalar potential , one must also consider terms corresponding to the allowed couplings of color octet scalars to quarks . in the quark mass eigenstate basis ,",
    "the new yukawa sector becomes , @xmath22    direct coupling to quarks is an important source of jet production in this model , but it is not the only one .",
    "one must also consider decays of @xmath23 to gluon pairs through scalar loops ( see , ref .",
    "@xcite ) similar to those in figure [ fig : fd2 ] .",
    "this time , however , additional decays through quark loops ( figure [ fig : fd3 ] ) are allowed , with the diagram including a top loop contributing the most .",
    "when color octet scalars are coupled to quarks through the lagrangian terms ( [ ql ] ) with large enough @xmath24 , the dominant decay channel ( for sufficiently large scalar masses ) is to third - generation quarks , giving distinctive @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 signatures at the lhc ( see , ref .",
    "however , when the coupling to quarks is very small , the neutral real component @xmath28 decays predominantly to gluon pairs through scalar loops ( the top quark loop contribution becomes negligible in this regime ) . the effective lagrangian term describing this decay is , @xmath29 where @xmath30",
    ", @xmath31 are two of the couplings in the scalar potential ( see , eq .",
    "( 6 ) in ref .",
    "in addition , the imaginary part of the neutral component @xmath32 and the charged components @xmath33 decay through diagrams shown in figure [ fig : fdn ] .",
    "we note that the decays @xmath34 and @xmath35 can also occur through a scalar loop , but this effect turns out to be negligible .    in the case of small couplings to quarks , the weak doublet color octet scalars are produced similarly as the weak singlets ( see , figure 1 ) , with the scalar pairs being either : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , or @xmath39 .",
    "the scalar production in the first three cases has contributions from all diagrams shown in figure 1 , whereas the last process is described only by the diagram in figure 1 ( b ) .",
    "each of those cases corresponds to a different lhc signature : 4 jets , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "once again , the signal - to - background ratio can be improved by adopting high @xmath2 cuts .",
    "we used madgraph / madevent @xcite ( version 1.3.1 of madgraph 5 ) to simulate the standard model background and calculate the scalar signal cross section at the lhc running at 7 and 14 @xmath43 center of mass energy , for different jet @xmath2 cuts and , in the weak singlet case , cuts on jet pair invariant masses . apart from this ,",
    "the default madgraph run card was used , along with the @xmath44 pdfs .",
    "jets were ordered by @xmath2 , from highest to lowest . for the simulation of events involving scalars , we used feynrules @xcite to generate a model file for madgraph / madevent .",
    "events were run through pythia and pgs .",
    "madanalysis was used to plot the results .",
    "we point out that a similar analysis for weak singlet scalars was performed in ref.@xcite using pythia 5.7 . in this paper , however , we improve their analysis by running the events simulated using madgraph / madevent through pythia 6.420 and pgs4 .",
    "we also implement a larger set of @xmath2 cuts and impose a slightly different invariant mass cut .",
    "in addition , we present plots of the differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass of jet pairs and discuss the current constraints on the color octet scalar masses .",
    "we note that cuts can be tuned based on the scalar mass in order to maximize the effects of the scalars , at the same time leaving a large enough data sample .",
    "the restriction on the invariant mass of jet pairs we adopted is , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the invariant mass of the @xmath47-th and @xmath48-th jet as ranked by @xmath2 , and `` perms . ''",
    "denotes the other two possible pairings of the four jets .",
    "this cut simply requires that for at least one of the possible pairings the resulting invariant masses of jet pairs are within @xmath49 of each other .",
    "this should significantly suppress the standard model background , whereas the scalar signal is expected to essentially remain unchanged .",
    "figure [ fig : scalarm14 ] shows the four - jet differential cross section as a function of the invariant mass of jets 1 and 4 for various weak singlet color octet scalar masses after adopting the jet invariant mass cut ( [ masscut ] ) and different @xmath2 cuts .",
    "the signal is compared to the standard model background .",
    "the cross sections corresponding to several invariant mass windows are given in table i. in each case one can calculate the predicted number of events by multiplying the cross section by the integrated luminosity , and estimate the significance using the standard formula , @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ fig : muvspt ] shows the weak singlet scalar signal significance for different scalar masses and three sample data sizes at 14 tev lhc center of mass energy .",
    "we choose @xmath51 since the discovery significance for higher @xmath2 cuts does not improve by much .",
    "for scalar masses above 1 tev the significance is too small for the signal to be detected with @xmath52 of data . on the other hand , according to figure [ fig : muvspt ] , if there exists a low mass color octet scalar , it should be discovered relatively early at the lhc running at 14 tev .",
    "we also investigated current lhc constraints on the scalar masses with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath52 of data collected at @xmath55 center of mass energy .",
    "figure [ fig : muvspt2 ] shows the plot of the signal significance in this case as a function of the scalar mass .",
    "those data samples are still too small to extract any constraints on the color octet scalar masses from the four - jet analysis .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have investigated the effect of @xmath56 singlet and doublet color octet scalars on high @xmath2 four - jet events at the lhc .",
    "we analyzed part of the available parameter space , concentrating on the region least explored so far , i.e. , with no couplings or very weak couplings to quarks .",
    "we identified the proper signatures in both cases and imposed cuts which improved the signal significance .    in case of weak singlet",
    "color octet scalars , one of the best signatures to look for are four - jet events . the standard model background is significantly suppressed by choosing high transverse momenta jets and cuts on the invariant mass of jet pairs .",
    "the signal is then strongly peaked around the invariant jet pair mass equal to the scalar mass .",
    "this method can be used to look for low mass scalars already in the first few inverse femtobarns of data from the lhc running at 14 tev center of mass energy .",
    "the same four - jet signature can be used to search for weak doublet color octet scalars with no couplings or very small couplings to quarks . however , in this case there are also other channels involving four jets accompanied by weak vector bosons in the final state . because the standard model background is extremely small for those additional processes",
    ", such channels might be better to look at in search for weak doublet color octet scalars , especially since for massive scalars this signal should be much more significant than the four - jet signal .",
    "we performed such an analysis for particular values of the scalar potential parameters . in the case of stronger couplings between the @xmath0 doublet scalars and quarks , final states involving bottom and top quarks",
    "are more promising channels for discovery .",
    "the authors would like to express their special thanks to mark wise for inspirational discussions and many extremely helpful comments at all stages of the work on this paper .",
