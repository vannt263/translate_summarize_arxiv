    "a cosmographical description of the galaxy distribution is crucial to our understanding of the mechanisms of structure formation that generate the complex pattern of sheets and filaments comprising the ` cosmic web ' . today , there are many more redshifts available for galaxies than velocity measurements .",
    "this discrepancy has inspired a great deal of work on methods for the reconstruction of the mass and velocity fields from redshifts alone .",
    "these methods use a variety of functional representations ( e.g. cartesian , fourier , spherical harmonics or wavelets ) and smoothing techniques ( e.g. a gaussian or a top - hat sphere ) .",
    "however , several complications arise when one tries to reconstruct peculiar velocity and real - space mass density fields directly from redshift surveys .",
    "first , one must relate the light distribution to the mass field . on large scales ,",
    "this relationship is generally assumed to be linear with a proportionality constant ( but see e.g. wild 2005 ; conway 2005 ; marinoni 2005 who argue that biasing is non - linear and redshift dependent even on large scales ) .",
    "another common assumption is that the galaxy distribution samples the underlying smooth mass field and the finite sampling of the smooth field introduces poisson ` shot noise ' errors .",
    "yet another important physical problem associated with the recovery of the real - space mass density field from the galaxy density field is the correction of the distortions in the redshift space clustering pattern .",
    "furthermore , in redshift surveys the actual number of galaxies in a given volume is larger than the number observed , particularly in flux limited samples where at large distances only the very luminous galaxies can be seen .    in this paper , we recover the real - space density and predicted velocity fields of the 2mrs ( huchra 2005 ) .",
    "the reconstruction procedure used is based on linear theory and closely follows fisher ( 1995 , hereafter flhlz ) .",
    "the density field in redshift - space is decomposed into spherical harmonics and bessel functions ( _ fourier - bessel functions _ ) .",
    "then the real - space density and velocity fields are reconstructed from those in the redshift - space using a wiener filter .",
    "the idea of cosmography using spherical harmonics goes back to peebles ( 1973 ) but the method only gained popularity with the advent of all - sky surveys .",
    "since then , it has been applied to the infrared astronomical satellite ( @xmath7 ) selected galaxy surveys ( e.g. to the @xmath7 1.2 jy survey by fabbri & natale 1990 ; scharf 1992 ; scharf & lahav 1993 ; fisher , scharf & lahav 1994 ; lahav 1994 ; nusser & davis 1994 ; heavens & taylor 1995 and to @xmath7 point source catalogue redshift survey ( pscz ) by tadros 1999 , hamilton , tegmark & padmanabhan 2000 ; taylor 2001 ) and the peculiar velocity catalogues ( e.g. to elliptical galaxy sample by regs & szalay 1989 ; to mark iii galaxy sample by davis , nusser & willick 1996 and hoffman 2001 ) .",
    "the spherical harmonics technique has proven to be very convenient for addressing many of the problems inherent to the analyses of redshift surveys .",
    "the spherical harmonics are one of the most convenient ways of smoothing the noisy data .",
    "a careful choice of spherical coefficients greatly reduces the statistical uncertainties and errors introduced by the non - linear effects .",
    "furthermore , the treatment of linear redshift distortions are particularly straightforward in fourier - bessel space , especially for surveys which have almost all - sky coverage and dense sampling such as 2mrs .",
    "the wiener - filtered fields are optimal reconstructions in the sense that the variance between the derived reconstruction and the underlying true field is minimised . as opposed to _ ad hoc _ smoothing schemes , the smoothing due to the wiener filter is determined by the data . in the limit of high",
    "signal - to - noise , the wiener filter modifies the observed data only weakly , whereas it strongly suppresses the contribution of the data contaminated by shot noise .",
    "the three - dimensional wiener reconstruction of cosmological fields in fourier - bessel space was first developed by flhlz and applied to the @xmath7 1.2 jy survey .",
    "webster ( 1997 , hereafter wlf ) expanded on the initial results of flhlz .",
    "later , schmoldt ( 1999 ) applied the same method to the @xmath7 pscz survey to recover density and velocity fields .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in the next section , we describe the two micron redshift survey . in section",
    "[ sec:2mass : sph ] , we give a brief summary of the decomposition of the density field in redshift - space into a set of orthogonal spherical harmonics and bessel functions . in section",
    "[ sec:2mass : zdistort ] , we discuss how these redshift - space harmonics are related to those in real - space . in section  [ sec:2mass : wf ] ,",
    "we give expressions for the wiener filter in fourier - bessel space .",
    "the implementation of the method to 2mrs is given in section  [ sec:2mass : app ] , along with the maps of the density and velocity fields .",
    "in the same section , we also show reconstruction of the local group ( lg ) acceleration determined directly from harmonic coefficients .",
    "the last section contains a discussion and summary of the work . throughout this paper , we assume that the galaxy distribution is related to the underlying smooth mass density field by the linear bias parameter , @xmath8 , so that @xmath9 . with this notation ,",
    "the constant of proportionality between velocity and the density field is @xmath4 , where @xmath10 .",
    "it is worth emphasising that one of the ultimate goals of this work is to test linear biasing by comparing the reconstructed velocity fields with the observed peculiar velocity field .",
    "the distances are given in units of velocity and the hubble constant is @xmath11 = 100 @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "the two micron all - sky redshift survey ( 2mrs ) is the densest all - sky redshift survey to date .",
    "the galaxies in the northern celestial hemisphere are being observed by the fred lawrence whipple observatory ( flwo ) 1.5-m telescope , the arecibo 305-m telescope and the green bank 100-m telescope . in the southern hemisphere , most galaxies at high galactic latitude ( about 6000 galaxies ) were observed as a part of the 6-degree field galaxy survey ) than 2mrs and contains around 150,000 galaxy redshifts .",

    "the first phase of 2mrs is now complete . in this phase we obtained redshifts for approximately 23,150 2mass galaxies from a total sample of 24,773 galaxies with extinction corrected magnitudes ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) brighter than @xmath0 .",
    "this magnitude limit corresponds to a median redshift of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "almost all of the 1600 galaxies that remain without redshifts are at very low galactic latitudes ( @xmath16 ) or obscured / confused by the dust and the high stellar density towards the galactic centre .",

    "galaxies without measured redshifts are plotted in black .",
    "2mrs can be compared with the deeper 2mass galaxy catalogue ( k@xmath2114th mag ) shown in jarrett ( 2004 , figure 1 ) .",
    "2mass has good photometric uniformity and an unprecedented integral sky coverage .",
    "the photometric uniformity is better than @xmath22 over the sky including the celestial poles ( e.g. jarrett 2000@xmath23 , 2003 ) and at magnitudes brighter than @xmath24 , 2mass is essentially complete down to very low galactic latitudes ( to @xmath25 , e.g. huchra 2005 ) .",
    "the uniform completeness of the galaxy sample is slightly limited by the presence of foreground stars , for a typical high latitude sky less than @xmath26 of the area is masked .",
    "these missing regions are accounted for using a coverage map , defined as the fraction of the area of an 8@xmath278pixel that is not obscured by stars brighter than 10th mag .",
    "galaxies are then weighted by the inverse of the completeness , although the analysis is almost unaffected by this process as the completeness ratio is very close to one for most parts of the sky .",
    "the stellar contamination of the catalogue is low and is reduced further by manually inspecting the objects below a heliocentric redshift of @xmath28 .",
    "the foreground stellar confusion is highest at low galactic latitudes , resulting in decreasing overall completeness of the 2mass catalogue ( e.g. jarrett 2000@xmath8 ) and consequently the 2mrs sample .",
    "stellar confusion also produces colour bias in the 2mass galaxy photometry ( cambresy , jarrett & beichman 2005 ) but this bias should not be significant for 2mrs due to its relatively bright magnitude limit .",
    "2mrs uses the 2mass magnitude @xmath29 , which is definedm@xmath30k20fc ) in the 2mass in the extended source catalogue ( xsc ) ] as the magnitude inside the circular isophote corresponding to a surface brightness of @xmath31 arcsec@xmath32 ( e.g. jarrett 2000@xmath23 ) .",
    "the isophotal magnitudes underestimate the total luminosity by @xmath33 for the early - type and @xmath34 for the late - type galaxies ( jarrett 2003 ) . following kochanek ( 2001 , appendix ) , an offset of @xmath35 is added to the @xmath29 magnitudes .",
    "the galaxy magnitudes are corrected for galactic extinction using the dust maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) and an extinction correction coefficient of @xmath36 ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) . as expected ,",
    "the extinction corrections are small for the 2mrs sample .",
    "the @xmath37 band @xmath38-correction is derived by kochanek ( 2001 ) based on the stellar population models of worthey ( 1994 ) .",
    "the k - correction of @xmath39 , is independent of galaxy type and valid for @xmath40 .",
    "the flux , @xmath41 , for each galaxy is computed from the apparent magnitudes using @xmath42 where the zero point offset is @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the @xmath37 band ( cohen , wheaton & megeath 2003 ) .",
    "the redshift distribution of 2mrs is shown in figure  [ fig:2mrsnz ] .",
    "the @xmath7 pscz survey redshift distribution ( saunders 2000 ) is also plotted for comparison .",
    "2mrs samples the galaxy distribution better than the pscz survey out to @xmath45 .",
    "the selection function of the survey ( i.e. the probability of detecting a galaxy as a function of distance ) is modelled using a parametrised fit to the redshift distribution : @xmath46dz\\ ; , \\label{eqn : dnz2mrs}\\ ] ] with best - fit parameters of @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . this best - fit is also shown in figure  [ fig:2mrsnz ] ( solid line ) .",

    "this section describes the spherical harmonic expansion of the density and velocity fields .",
    "spherical harmonics are commonly employed in cosmography of whole - sky surveys for two main reasons .",
    "firstly , separating the observed density field into angular and radial modes concentrates the linear scale redshift distortions into one dimension , making distortions easier to deconvolve . secondly ,",
    "both spherical harmonic and bessel functions are orthogonal and together they form eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator .",
    "these properties lead to very simple relationships between the density , the velocity and the potential fields in harmonic space , allowing the straightforward reconstruction of one field from another observed field .",
    "the method used in this paper is based on that developed by flhlz .",
    "therefore , we do not give a full description of our method , we only outline the formalism .",
    "the density field , @xmath55 , can be expanded as a fourier - bessel series in the following way : @xmath56 here , @xmath57 is the density coefficient , @xmath58 is the spherical harmonic corresponding to the spherical angular coordinates , @xmath59 is the spherical bessel function and @xmath60 is the normalisation constant of the spherical bessel function .",

    "tend to infinity . in practice , since the distances which galaxy surveys probe are finite , @xmath63 and @xmath62 need to be truncated at finite numbers .",
    "this truncation is an effective smoothing of the density field and limits the resolution of the structure in the reconstruction such that the structures smaller than the effective resolution of the highest harmonic , @xmath64 ( cf .",
    "peebles 1980 , section 46 ) and the highest radial mode , @xmath65 , will be lost . on the other hand , if the expansion is continued to a very high order the resolution of expansion will be higher than the size of the real structure , introducing artifacts into the reconstruction of density field .",
    "the choice of @xmath63 and @xmath62 is discussed in section 6 .",
    "the radial modes , @xmath66 , correspond to a given angular mode @xmath67 and the @xmath60s are chosen according to the boundary conditions and to ensure the orthogonality of the spherical bessel functions . it is assumed that the data are only given within a sphere of radius @xmath68 and that the logarithmic derivative of the gravitational potential is continuous at @xmath69 . the corresponding value of @xmath60 is @xmath70 ^ 2\\right)$ ] . the derivation of this result is given in flhlz , appendix a.    given that the data from a flux - limited redshift catalogue are a set of n discrete points with a redshift - space position vector * s * and a weighting function @xmath71 , the harmonic density coefficients in redshift space can be derived using the inversion formula , @xmath72 where the superscripts @xmath41 and @xmath68 hereafter denote redshift and real - space , respectively .",
    "we give each galaxy the weight @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the selection function of galaxy @xmath75 .    the density fluctuations , @xmath76 , can be estimated in terms of the fourier - bessel function @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the mean density of the survey and the second term @xmath79 represents a monopole correction ( cf .",
    "flhlz , equation d14 ) .",
    "the linear theory velocity field in spherical harmonics is given by regs & szalay ( 1989 ) .",
    "it is derived by expanding the gravitational potential @xmath80 and the density fluctuations @xmath81 in fourier - bessel series , and substituting these into poisson s equation .",
    "since @xmath82 is an eigenfunction of the laplacian operator , @xmath83=-k_n^2 j_l(k_nr)y_{lm}(\\theta,\\phi),\\ ] ] the harmonics of the gravity field can be related to those of the galaxy density field as : @xmath84    the radial component of the velocity field , @xmath85 , can be decomposed into harmonics as in equation  [ eq : denexp ] .",

    "the harmonics of the transverse velocity field ( @xmath94 $ ] ) are also related to those of the density field .",
    "they can be derived using quantum mechanical methods ( see flhlz , appendix c2 ) .",
    "the galaxy peculiar velocities will only introduce distortions in the radial direction , leaving the angular parts intact .",
    "thus , if the density field in redshift - space is expressed in terms of the orthogonal radial and the angular components , as it is the case in the fourier - bessel space , the redshift distortions will only couple the radial modes of the real space density field .",
    "this coupling is described by a coupling matrix , @xmath95 ( fisher 1994 and flhlz ) : @xmath96 where @xmath97 depends only on @xmath11 , @xmath4 , @xmath98 and @xmath51 and is independent of the power spectrum and @xmath99 for catalogues with incomplete sky coverage .",

    "the full derivation of the coupling matrix is given in flhlz , appendix d. we note that equation  [ eq : rhostorhor ] is calculated for linear scales only .",
    "on small scales , the peculiar velocities introduce radially extended distortions called _ fingers of god_. these distortions can be corrected for either by collapsing the fingers to a point at high density regions or by assuming a maxwellian distribution for the peculiar velocities ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) and deconvolving this distribution from the reconstructed fields ( heavens & taylor 1995 ; erdodu 2004 ) . in any case , they will not change the constructed fields substantially as they are smoothed out due to the resolution of the spherical harmonics ( see erdodu 2004 who use who a similar resolution ) .    in the absence of shot - noise , the real - space density harmonics",
    "can simply be obtained by inverting the coupling matrix in equation  [ eq : rhostorhor ] .",
    "however , in the presence of shot - noise , a straight inversion becomes unstable leading to inaccurate estimation of the real - space harmonics .",

    "the formulation of @xmath95 involves the taylor expansion of the velocity field out to first order in @xmath109 ( see appendix d of flhlz ) .",
    "as such , the reconstruction will be more accurate in the frame in which @xmath110 is smaller .",
    "nearby where the galaxies share the lg motion , it is more accurate to correct for the redshift distortions in the lg frame . at larger distances ,",
    "galaxy motions are independent of the lg velocity and thus @xmath110 is smaller in the cmb frame .",
    "since 2mrs probes the local universe ( @xmath111 ) , we will work with the lg frame redshifts .",
    "we will present the dipole velocity results from redshifts in both frames .",
    "the choice of frame for the redshifts will not affect the frame of the reconstructed density field . in both cases",
    ", the reconstructed harmonics will be in real - space .",
    "consequently , the reconstructed velocity field ( equation  [ eq : vlmn ] ) will be in the cmb frame .",
    "it is possible to convert the velocity field into the lg frame by subtracting the local group velocity ( @xmath112 , towards @xmath113 , @xmath114 , bennett 2003 and courteau & van den bergh 1999 ) . in the following section",
    ", the reconstructed velocity maps will be presented in either the lg or the cmb frames .",
    "up to 8000 ( figures  [ fig : velshells(a ) ] ,  [ fig : velshells(b ) ] ,  [ fig : velshells(c ) ] and  [ fig : velshells(d ) ] ) it is difficult to see the real nature of the structures in the lg frame as the lg velocity dominates .",
    "therefore , the maps will be plotted in the cmb frame . on larger distances",
    "( figures  [ fig : velshells(e ) ] ,  [ fig : velshells(f ) ] ,  [ fig : velshells(g ) ] and  [ fig : velshells(h ) ] ) , galaxies have positive cmb radial velocities so it is easier to compare the velocities in the lg frame than in the cmb frame .",
    "the formalism discussed in the previous sections is limited to @xmath115 sky coverage . in principle",
    ", the analysis can be extended to account explicitly for incomplete sky coverage . in this paper",
    ", a simpler approach has been adopted to fill in the galaxies masked by the galactic plane ( the _ zone of avoidance _ ) .",
    "the masked area is divided into 36 bins of @xmath116 in longitude . in each angular bin ,",
    "the distance is divided into bins of 10 @xmath1 mpc .",
    "the galaxies in each longitude / distance bin are then sampled from the corresponding longitude / distance bins in the adjacent strips @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 or @xmath119 ) .",
    "these galaxies are then placed in random latitudes within the mask region .",
    "the number of galaxies in each masked bin is set to a random poisson deviate whose mean equals the mean number of galaxies in the adjacent unmasked strips .",
    "this procedure is carried out to mimic the shot noise effects .",
    "the success of this interpolation method depends on the interplay between the width of the mask , the angular resolution and whether the structure in the adjacent regions physically correlate with the structure in the zone of avoidance .",
    "the method is less robust for masked areas larger than @xmath120 ( lahav 1994 ) .",
    "the width of the 2mrs mask is much smaller than this value and the survey penetrates deep into the zone of avoidance apart from very obscured regions near the centre of the milky way .",
    "we also test the effects of our method by varying the bin sizes and by filling the region uniformly instead of interpolating .",
    "we calculate the angular power - spectrum for each case and find good agreement ( rassat 2006 ) between them .",
    "the density field is expanded within a spherical volume of radius @xmath121 .",
    "we impose the condition that the density field outside @xmath122 is zero and the logarithmic derivative of the gravitational potential is continuous at the boundary ( which holds if @xmath123 for all @xmath67 ) .",
    "there are two other possible boundary conditions discussed in flhlz : setting only the density or the radial velocity zero at the boundary .",
    "we have tested our reconstructions using these boundary conditions . setting the density to zero at the boundary results in a discontinuous potential and",
    "the reconstructed radial velocities become unrealistically high . up to a distance of 10000 @xmath6 ,",
    "the fields reconstructed using the zero velocity boundary condition agree reasonably well with those reconstructed using the continuous potential condition , however the radial velocities of the zero velocity reconstructions are slightly higher . beyond 10000 @xmath6",
    ", the radial velocities of the zero velocity reconstructions tend to zero , however the backside infall into the shapley supercluster still exists .",
    "thus we conclude that setting the logarithmic derivative of the gravitational potential to be continuous at the boundary allows for a _ smooth _ transition of the density and velocity fields from @xmath124 to @xmath125 and as such gives the most robust results .",
    "we also note that flhlz , wlf and schmoldt ( 1999 ) use the same boundary condition for their reconstructions .",
    "the resolution of the reconstruction depends on the maximum values of angular and radial modes ( see figure 6 of wlf ) .",
    "we want to have as high a resolution as possible without introducing artificial structures to the field .",
    "therefore , we compute the harmonics up to @xmath126 angularly and @xmath127 radially",
    ". @xmath128 is chosen so that the angular resolution ( @xmath129 ) is comparable to the width of the interpolated region and the radial modes are chosen to match the angular resolution ( see flhlz , appendix b for a detailed discussion ) .",

    "these artifacts are still clearly evident in the top right plot where the density field is corrected for redshift distortions ( using equation  [ eq : rhostorhor ] ) but without noise supression .",
    "the correction of the redshift distortions reduces the overall amplitude of the density contrasts and makes the structures more spherical .",
    "this reconstruction corresponds to the unbiased minimal variance ( umv ) estimation of zaroubi ( 2002 ) since in our case the redshift distortion matrix is invertible .",
    "the bottom left panel shows the real space density field after the wiener filter has been applied .",
    "as expected the wiener filter mitigates the effects of shot noise , removing the artifacts and high frequency harmonics from the map , however , the wiener reconstructed field is biased towards the mean field which is zero by construction .",
    "in fact , the variance of the wiener filtered field is always smaller than the variance of the _ true _ underlying field . in order to overcome this drawback , yahil ( 1994 ) introduced an alternative filter which preserves the power in the underlying field .",
    "this filter is defined as the square root of the wiener filter . with this definition ,",
    "the filtered field equals to that of the true field .",
    "the bottom right panel shows the real - space density field reconstructed using yahil s filter . whilst the estimated field is unbiased , the reconstruction is not optimal in the sense of minimum variance and there are artifacts due to insufficient reduction of noise .",

    "the lg velocity is reconstructed from the density field .",
    "there are two main advantages of the analysis performed in this paper .",
    "firstly , working with spherical harmonic allows for reliable correction of the velocity flows and secondly , the wiener filtering suppresses the noise self - consistently .",
    "the lg dipole is linear in the galaxy density field ( assuming linear biasing ) .",
    "consequently , the dipole computed from the wiener filter algorithm will be an optimal ( in the sense of minimum variance ) estimate of the dipole due to matter within the reconstruction volume as long as non - linear effects can be neglected .",
    "the reconstructed 2mrs dipole ( equation  [ eq : v(r)lgsph ] ) and the expected scatter ( equation  [ eq : vscatter ] ) in the reconstruction is plotted as a function of distance in the top plot of figure  [ fig : dipolewiener ] .",

    "the black line is the dipole reconstructed with @xmath149 ( rescaled to @xmath250 ) and the dashed line denotes the scatter in the velocity reconstruction .",
    "the inversion of the radial coupling matrix introduces a non - linear relationship between the value of @xmath4 and the amplitude of the reconstructed acceleration . to illustrate this",
    ", we also plot the dipole reconstructed with @xmath250 ( the green line ) .",
    "the amplitudes of the dipole reconstructions using @xmath149 and @xmath250 are in good agreement ( within the expected scatter ) and the misalignment angles are almost the same up to 13000 .",
    "the blue line is the dipole reconstructed with @xmath149 from the cmb redshifts . as expected , the amplitude of the dipole is underestimated at nearby distances and the misalignment angle is bigger than the dipole reconstructed from the lg redshifts . we conclude that , since the lg dipole is dominated by nearby galaxies , it is more accurate to use the lg redshifts in the reconstruction .",
    "we also plot the number - weighted dipole obtained using raw redshifts ( solid red line erdodu 2006 ) and the associated shot noise ( dashed red line ) .",
    "the bottom plot indicates that the direction of the wiener - reconstructed dipole is consistent with the dipole obtained in erdodu 2006 ) .",
    "both dipoles show the ` tug of war ' between the great attractor and perseus - pisce and the dipole velocities are dominated by structure within the distance of 50 @xmath1 mpc . however , the amplitude of the wiener dipole is less than the number - weighted dipole .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the previous paper , we did not filter the shot noise errors .",
    "furthermore , in the previous paper , we did not take peculiar velocities into account when calculating the number - weighted dipole and these will lead to the over - estimation of the lg - frame dipole ( the _ rocket effect _ ) .",
    "the value for @xmath4 we obtain by equating the cmb dipole measurements with our reconstructed dipole reflects the decrease in the amplitude .",
    "we get @xmath251 at 13000 whereas we find @xmath252 at 13000 in erdodu ( 2006 ) . the convergence of the direction of the lg dipole does not seem affected by the velocity corrections but there is in general better alignment between the wiener - reconstructed lg dipole and the cmb dipole than the lg dipole , calculated directly from the raw data and the cmb dipole .",
    "the misalignment angle of the wiener dipole from the lg redshifts is almost as that of the raw - data dipole up to 13000 and the angle is @xmath253 at this distance .",
    "at least half of this misalignment is probably due to the fact that when we modeled the lg dipole , we assumed all the galaxies have the same weight ( see erdodu 2006 ) .",
    "also our analysis uses linear perturbation theory which is correct only to first order @xmath254 .",
    "there may be contributions to the lg dipole from small scales which would cause gravity and the velocity vectors to misalign .",
    "in this paper , the wiener reconstruction technique was applied to recover real - space density and velocity fields from 2mrs .",
    "the observed density field was first expanded in terms of spherical harmonics and spherical bessel functions ( equations  [ eq : denexp ] and  [ eq : deltalmn ] ) which are both orthogonal and which together satisfy poisson s equation .",
    "then , the redshift distortions , described by the coupling matrix @xmath255 , were corrected for by the matrix inversion of @xmath255 in equation  [ eq : rhostorhor ] , assuming linear theory and a value of @xmath256 .",
    "after the inversion , the real - space density field was estimated using the wiener filter for a given cdm power spectrum with @xmath257 and @xmath258 ( equations  [ eq : rholmnwf ] ,  [ eq : s ] and  [ eq : nlmn ] ) .",
    "finally , the velocity field is reconstructed from the wiener - filtered density field using equations  [ eq : vlmn ] .",
    "the reconstructed density field resolves most of the known structures as well as new clusters and voids .",
    "the density and velocity fields agree well with the @xmath7 pscz and 1.2-jy fields derived using the wiener filter technique .",
    "there is a back - side infall towards the great attractor region , in agreement with schmoldt ( 1999 ) and flhlz .",
    "there is a strong outflow towards the shapley supercluster which suggests that shapley plays an important dynamical role in the local velocity field .",
    "the lg dipole derived from the reconstructed velocity field is lower in amplitude at all distances than the lg dipole derived from the raw data by erdodu ( 2006 ) .",
    "the misalignment angle between the cmb dipole and the 2mrs dipole decreases down to @xmath259 at 5000 and its amplitude is about 800 @xmath260 .",
    "if our canonical value for @xmath4 is correct then this suggests most of the acceleration is generated within 5000 and the structure at higher distances contributes less than @xmath261 to the lg dipole . the ` tug - of - war ' between the great attractor and the perseus - pisces supercluster to which the dipole is commonly attributed can clearly be seen in figure  [ fig : velshells(a ) ] .",
    "the 2mrs dipole agrees well with the best - fit value for the canonical model to the data with @xmath149 , for fixed @xmath258 and @xmath257 .",

    "<S> we present the reconstructed real - space density and the predicted velocity fields from the two mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 2mrs is the densest all - sky redshift survey to date and includes about 23,200 galaxies with extinction corrected magnitudes brighter than @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our method is based on the expansion of these fields in fourier - bessel functions . within this framework </S>",
    "<S> , the linear redshift distortions only affect the density field in the radial direction and can easily be deconvolved using a distortion matrix . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this coordinate system , the velocity field is related to the density field by a simple linear transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the shot noise errors in the reconstructions are suppressed by means of a wiener filter which yields a minimum variance estimate of the density and velocity fields . using the reconstructed real - space density fields , we identify all major superclusters and voids . at 50 @xmath1 mpc </S>",
    "<S> , our reconstructed velocity field indicates a back - side infall to the great attractor region of @xmath2 in the local group frame and @xmath3 in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) frame and @xmath4 is the redshift distortion parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the reconstructed dipole agrees well with the dipole derived by erdodu ( 2006 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the misalignment between the reconstructed 2mrs and the cmb dipoles drops to 13@xmath5 at around 5000 @xmath6 but then increases at larger distances .    </S>",
