    "whether the first direct gravitational wave ( gw ) detection will be made during the forthcoming joint ligo - virgo @xcite run , or rather will be claimed by the next generation of interferometers , the intriguing era of gravitational wave astronomy is in any case expected to begin .    in this perspective ,",
    "spherical resonant detectors , having the capability of locating on their own the gravitational wave source in the sky , may represent an important resource for this arising discipline .",
    "contrarily to an interferometer , a sphere is a multichannel detector capable in principle to determine all the four parameters characterizing a gw ( two angles for the arrival direction , and the amplitudes of the two polarizations ) ; in order to deal with this distinguishing feature , several data analysis issues must be however tackled ( see @xcite- @xcite for an incomplete but elucidating historical perspective ) .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite a coherent burst search algorithm has been proposed , that fully exploits the multichannel capabilities of the sphere by transforming the detector s outputs into a five - dimensional time series corresponding to the spheroidal components of the gravitational wave .",
    "this time series is in turn processed by a coherent , wavelet - based module @xcite ( henceforth cws , as coherent waveburst for the sphere ) generating a list of candidate burst events endowed with all the relevant parameters ( arrival time , arrival direction , amplitude , etc ... ) and is also able , to some extent , to reject non - transverse excitations ( which are surely not due to gw s ) , thus reducing the false alarm rate by a factor of about 10 .",
    "the reason of using wavelets rather than the traditional matched filter(mf)-ing technique is two - fold .",
    "mf - based searches are computationally expensive , as they require the exploration of a parameter space which is made extremely large by the presence of several channels ( for example , the multichannel mf is direction dependent , differently from the traditional single channel one ) .",
    "moreover wavelet - based searches , contrarily to a mf one , do not require any detailed prior knowledge of a signal , a very welcome feature for an unmodeled burst search such as the one developed in @xcite .",
    "+ on the other hand , as the use of the mf is known to give the optimal signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite , the wavelets flexibility has a cost in term of accuracy in the determination of the burst parameters .    to this respect ,",
    "the present work can be considered as a natural evolution of @xcite in that it implements a multidimensional coherent mf as a follow - up of the method cited above .",
    "this hierarchical strategy is crucial in reducing the parameters space because for each trigger only a little region is explored around the values indicated by the cws module , thus making the whole procedure reasonably fast .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following : in section [ apip ] the whole pipeline is briefly described , showing in particular how the mf module is interfaced to the previous part of the analysis chain ; then in section [ resu ] the improved method is tested against the same mock data sets ( software injections of signals on a background endowed with both gaussian and non - gaussian noise , generated on the basis of a numerical simulation of the relevant components of the detector ) , thus showing the improvements obtained in the parameters estimation .",
    "finally , section [ conc ] contains our conclusions .",
    "the first part of the pipeline , which is exhaustively discussed in @xcite and @xcite , will be just briefly summarized here , leaving aside many technical details .",
    "the first step consists in converting the six transducers outputs @xmath4 into five channels corresponding to the 5 quadrupolar modes @xmath5 of the gw tensor @xmath6 : @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 labels the components of the real spherical harmonics @xmath10 ( defined and normalized as in @xcite ) , @xmath11 denotes the cartesian component of the tensor spherical harmonics and @xmath12 is the versor of the arrival direction of the gw .",
    "this conversion allows to extract the information about the gw from the detector s outputs ( or , equivalently , to express its noisy content in term of its  gw - equivalent \" ) and is possible once a mathematical model for the detector is available . in the case at hand ,",
    "the model consists of a set of coupled oscillators describing the dynamics of the relevant sphere vibrational modes , of the transducers , and of the electrical circuit that are at the core of the readout devices ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the next step is to combine the fourier transforms of the five @xmath5 channels into a single channel @xmath13 : @xmath14 this process is performed by extracting from the dataset the spectral density matrix , defined from @xmath15 and then by building the following quantity : @xmath16    this quantity is then fed into the cws algorithm , which is a modified version of the coherent waveburst algorithm developed for ligo ( @xcite-@xcite ) , that has been adapted to our computational needs ( a standard macpro machine with two 3ghz processors ) and to our detector configuration .",
    "this algorithm provides a list of triggers containing the various event features ( central time of events , amplitude , arrival direction , central spectral frequency and spectral frequency spread ) .",
    "the trigger list is finally further refined through an independent determination of the arrival direction ( the so - called determinant method ) , and a trigger is vetoed when the two reconstructed directions are not compatible .",
    "to summarize : @xmath17      if the time dependence , arrival direction and polarization of the gw signal were known , that is if the expression for the five functions @xmath18 were available , the optimal detection strategy would be to perform a multidimensional matched filter . as explained in @xcite , the multichannel mf consists in analyzing the following scalar channel : @xmath19 and is the strategy which gives the optimal snr @xmath20 for the given signal @xmath21 .",
    "the integrals are done on both positive and negative frequencies . however , in a real experimental situation @xmath21 is not known a priori and to employ efficiently a mf one should explore a huge number of points in a parameter space describing the temporal profile of the signal , as well as the arrival direction and polarization . thus the use of a mf in such a context is computationally very demanding .    the cws method exposed in the previous paragraph has been shown to find candidate events with a good efficiency / reliability ratio , without need to know the form of the signal .",
    "this allows to keep under control the computation time but of course it comes at a price for what concerns parameter estimation .",
    "the improvement we are introducing in this work consists in performing a multidimensional mf only in the time segments where candidates events have been selected by the cws , and to restrict the analysis to a small portion of parameter space centered around the parameters provided by the cws triggers .    specifically , we consider a two parameter family of sine - gaussian shapes to describe the time profile of the signal @xmath22",
    "y_{m_n}^{(2)}(\\theta,\\phi)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] impinging from the generic direction characterized by polar angles @xmath23 .",
    "since we have verified that the unmodeled search alone already gives a good estimation of the frequency spread @xmath24 ( an estimation which is not improved by the mf procedure ) , we kept it as fixed , in such a way that , for each candidate event we are basically exploring a small portion of the 4-dimensional parameter space @xmath25 .",
    "such a space is explored through a maximum - seeking algorithm , which searches for the point characterized by the maximum snr .",
    "we maximized first on the arrival time , as the peak of the snr is very sharp against this parameter , then on the central frequency and finally over the two angles of the arrival direction together , keeping at each stage the other parameters fixed at the value indicated by the cws triggers .",
    "this is a simplified choice of course , with respect to building a full parameter template bank , for instance , but it allows to obtain good results while keeping a low computational burden",
    ".    once found , the maximum - snr point in the parameter space defines the improved parameters of the candidate event , and if they happen to be too much different from the ones given by the unmodeled search , the event is discarded as spurious .",
    "this means that the mf follow - up procedure , as well as improving the events parameters , acts as a further veto against non - gw triggers , i.e. against signals which are not compatible with the transverse - traceless nature of gw s .",
    "such false triggers can come from gaussian noise or from non - gaussian disturbancies .",
    "the cws method alone is already optimized to reduce the latter s , and we will show that the application of the mf follow - up improves the performance with respect to the rejection of false triggers due to gaussian noise .",
    "we have tested the mf method on the triggers obtained in @xcite , i.e. 50 gw - injections , ( 25 for each polarization ) for each of the four @xmath26 amplitudes : @xmath27 and also on an equal number of non - gw injections ( signals whose power has been distributed randomly among the five sphere channels ) with the same amplitude .",
    "the injected signals are sine - gaussian of the same type of the matching function given in ( [ singau ] ) , this allows us to assess the precision in parameter estimation irrespectively of a mismatch between the filter and the signal in the data .",
    "an eventual mismatch could of course worsen the estimations , but we do not investigate here on that .    for the sake of clarity , we have reported in table [ gwnongw ] the detection efficiency for both gw and non gw - injections obtained in @xcite ; these numbers , which show that the cws alone already reduces by a factor of 5 - 10 the number of non - gaussian false triggers , have not changed in the present analysis",
    ".    .detection efficiency for injected gw signals and non - gw disturbances . adapted from @xcite .",

    "matched filtering techniques are widely used in gravitational wave analysis . however",
    "they can have a high computational cost , because of the possibly large volume of parameter space required by a comprehensive search .",
    "the case of spherical detector is even worse as its multimode feature makes it highly sensitive to the arrival direction , adding the source position in the sky as further parameter .",
    "+ here we have shown how , in the case of burst searches , combining an unmodeled search with a matched one can exploit the goodies of both while taming the baddies of both .",
    "the unmodeled makes no assumption on the type of signal , but gives a non - optimal estimation of the parameters of the burst events triggered .",
    "on the other hand the matched filtered search is optimal once the shape of the signal is known . here",
    "we use the output triggers of the unmodeled search to massively restrict the search in the parameter of the best matching template ; more specifically we used a 4-dimensional parameter space ( arrival time , central frequency and source angles in the sky ) to present an example of matched filtering search .",
    "our search is very much simplified with respect to a general one as the parameter space is not fully explored .",
    "+ to make a comprehensive analysis one would need template banks and systematic scanning of the parameter space , but even with this primitive attempt we have shown how the first estimate made by the unmodeled search can be improved by a very light matched filter search .",
