    "rogue ( freak ) waves can be described as high amplitude waves with a height bigger than @xmath0 times the significant waveheight in a wavefield .",
    "their studies have become extensive in recent years @xcite .",
    "the research has emerged with the investigation of one of the simplest nonlinear models , which is the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse)@xcite . discovery of the unexpected rogue wave solutions of the nlse resulted in seminal studies of rogue wave dynamics , such as @xcite .",
    "their existence is not necessarily restricted to optical media @xcite , they can also be observed in hydrodynamics , bose - einstein condensation , acoustics and finance , just to name a few @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that in a medium whose dynamics are described by the nlse and nlse like equations , rogue waves can also emerge .    analyzing the dynamics , shapes and statistics of rogue wavy optical fields",
    "are crucially important to satisfy certain power and communication constraints . considering that the light can be quantized and the dynamics of atomic particles can be described by the nlse , it is natural to expect that rogue waves can also be observed in quantum mechanical systems . in this study",
    "we consider the rogue waves encountered in optics and in quantum mechanics , for latter the ` rogue wavefunction ' terminology can also be used .    on the other hand ,",
    "zeno dynamics @xcite , which is the inhibition of the evolution of an unstable quantum state by appropriate frequent observations during a time interval has attracted an intense attention in quantum science , usually for protecting the quantum system from decaying due to inevitable interactions with its environment .",
    "it emerged that the observation alters the evolution of an atomic particle , even can stop it @xcite .",
    "duan and guo showed that the dissipation of two particles can be prevented @xcite , viola and lloyd proposed a dynamical suppression of decoherence of qubit systems @xcite , maniscalco et al . proposed a strategy to fight against the decoherence of the entanglement of two atoms in a lossy resonator @xcite , nourmandipour et al . studied zeno and anti - zeno effects on the entanglement dynamics of dissipative qubits coupled to a common bath @xcite , and bernu et al",
    ". froze the coherent field growth in a cavity @xcite .",
    "quantum zeno dynamics can also be used for creating entanglement and realizing controlled operations .",
    "wang et al . proposed a collective threshold measurement scheme for creating entanglement , avoiding the difficulty of applying cnot gates or performing bell measurements @xcite , which can be extended to multipartite entangled states . since the generation of w states is more sophisticated than the generation of ghz states or cluster states @xcite , chen et al .",
    "proposed to use zeno dynamics for generation of w states robust against decoherence and photon loss @xcite and barontini et al . experimentally demonstrated the deterministic generation of w states by quantum zeno dynamics @xcite .",
    "nakazoto et al",
    ". further showed that purifying quantum systems is possible via zeno - like measurements @xcite .",
    "classical analogues of quantum zeno dynamics have also been reported in optical fibers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we numerically investigate the quantum zeno dynamics of the rogue waves that are encountered in optics and quantum mechanics . with this motivation , in the second section of this paper we review the nlse and the split - step fourier method for its numerical solution .",
    "we also review a procedure applied to wavefunction to model the zeno dynamics of an observed system . in the third section of this paper ,",
    "we analyze the quantum zeno dynamics of the akhmediev breathers , peregrine and akhmediev - peregrine soliton solutions of the nlse , which are used as models to describe the rogue waves .",
    "we show that frequent measurements of the wave inhibits the movement of the wave in the observation domain for each of these types of rogue waves .",
    "we also analyze the spectra of the rogue waves under zeno dynamics and discuss the effect of observation frequency on the rogue wave profile and on the probability of lingering of the wave in the observation domain . in the last section",
    "we conclude our work and summarize future research tasks .",
    "the quantum mechanics of atomic particles is generally studied in the frame of the schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "since the linearized schrdinger equation is commonly used , many important nonlinear phenomena is either unknown or ignored by the researchers working in the field of quantum science .",
    "however , in order to study nonlinear phenomena such as rational rogue wave solitons , it is mandatory to utilize nlse @xcite . with this aim",
    ", we consider the nondimensional nlse given as @xmath1 where @xmath2 are the spatial and temporal variables , @xmath3 is the complex number and @xmath4 is the complex amplitude known as the wavefunction .",
    "this notation is mainly used in quantum mechanics and hydrodynamics whereas @xmath5 and @xmath6 axes are switched in fiber optics studies , where nlse is used to describe the dynamics of light pulses in nonlinear fiber optical media .",
    "it is known that the nlse given by eq.([eq01 ] ) admits many different types of analytical solutions .",
    "some of these solutions are reviewed in the next section of this paper . for arbitrary wavefunctions , where the analytical solution is unknown",
    ", the nlse can be numerically solved by a split - step fourier method ( ssfm ) , which is one of the most commonly used forms of the spectral methods .",
    "similar to other spectral methods , the spatial derivatives are calculated using spectral techniques in ssfm .",
    "some applications of the spectral techniques can be seen in @xcite and their more comprehensive analysis can be seen in @xcite .",
    "the temporal derivatives in the governing equations is calculated using time integration schemes such as adams - bashforth and runge - kutta etc .",
    "@xcite , however ssfm uses an exponential time stepping function for this purpose .",
    "ssfm is based on the idea of splitting the equation into two parts , namely the linear and the nonlinear parts .",
    "then time stepping is performed starting from the initial conditions . in a possible",
    "splitting we take the first part of the nlse as @xmath7 which can exactly be solved as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the time step and @xmath10 is the initial condition .",
    "the second part of the nlse can be written as @xmath11 using a fourier series expansion we obtain @xmath12 \\right ] \\label{eq05}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the wavenumber . combining eq.([eq03 ] ) and eq.([eq05 ] )",
    ", the final form of the ssfm becomes @xmath14 \\right ] .",
    "\\label{eq06}\\ ] ] starting from the initial conditions , the time integration of the nlse can be done by the ssfm .",
    "two fast fourier transform ( fft ) operations per time step are needed for this form of the ssfm .",
    "the time step is selected as @xmath15 , which does not cause a stability problem .",
    "the number of spectral components are taken as @xmath16 in order to use the fft routines efficiently .",
    "although it is known that the decay of an atomic particle can be inhibited by zeno dynamics , it remains an open question whether the rogue waves in the quantized optical fields and rogue wavefunctions of the evolving atomic particles in the frame of the nlse can be stopped by zeno dynamics . in this paper",
    "we analyze the zeno dynamics of such rogue waves by using the ssfm reviewed above .",
    "although analytical solution of the nlse is known and used as initial conditions in time stepping of ssfm , after a positive zeno measurement the wavefunction becomes complicated thus numerical solution is needed .",
    "quantum zeno dynamics is generally modeled by some operations on the density matrix or hamiltonian of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "recently a theoretical wavefunction formulation of the quantum zeno dynamics is proposed in @xcite , used in @xcite and experimentally tested in @xcite . in this formulation after a positive measurement the particle is found in the observation domain of @xmath17 $ ] with a probability of @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 , @xmath22 elsewhere @xcite . between two successive positive measurements , the wave evolves according to nlse .",
    "this cycle can be summarized as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the observation index , @xmath25 is the number of observations @xcite and @xmath26 the cumulative probability of finding the wave in the observation domain becomes @xcite @xmath27 using the momentum representation of the linearized schrdinger equation and analogy of optical wave dynamics of fabry - perot resonator , an analytical derivation of the lingering probability of an atomic particle in the interval of @xmath17 $ ] after @xmath28 measurement is given as @xmath29 in @xcite .",
    "after @xmath25 measurements the cumulative probability of finding the particle in the observation domain becomes @xmath30 which can further be simplified using newton s binomial theorem @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite for the details of the derivation of these relations .",
    "we compare the analytical relations given in eqs.([eq10])-([eq11 ] ) with the numerical probability calculations in the next section of this paper .",
    "in order to study the zeno dynamics of rogue waves we first consider the akhmediev breather ( ab ) solution of the nlse given in eq.([eq01 ] ) .",
    "it is known that the nlse admits a solution in the form of @xmath31 \\exp{[it ] } \\label{eq12}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is a free parameter , @xmath33 and @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "this solution is known as ab and plays an essential role in describing the modulation instability mechanism and rogue wave generation .",
    "experiments have demonstrated that the abs can exist in optical fibers @xcite .",
    "the triangularization of the fourier spectrum , i.e. the triangular supercontinuum generation , plays a key role in the generation and early detection mechanisms of rogue waves .",
