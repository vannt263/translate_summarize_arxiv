    "charge transfer in native or designed molecular structures has attracted a substantial amount of research recently @xcite .",
    "this is mostly due to the perspective to exploit corresponding processes in a controlled way in integrated nano - electrical circuits @xcite .",
    "however , even though tremendous progress has been achieved , still various rather fundamental questions need to be elucidated .",
    "certainly , one of these is the role of the environmental degrees of freedom , originating from solvent and/or residual vibronic molecular degrees of freedom , which are often neglected in approaches based on transport theories for clean mesoscopic devices .",
    "nevertheless , they are known to be crucial for charge transfer in condensed phase structures @xcite .",
    "this is assumed to be particularly true in cases where impurities along the transport channel are to be surmounted by an intimate interplay between charge - phonon interactions such as thermal activation , nuclear tunneling , and coherent electronic tunneling ( superexchange ) .",
    "the development of effective approaches to include complex environments in the quantum dynamics of electronic systems has been one of the major goals in chemistry and physics as well @xcite .",
    "the widely used and powerful redfield formulation has revealed important aspects of charge transfer in various systems @xcite . however , as an approximate method it is limited to weak friction with high frequency vibronic modes and sufficiently high temperatures . in a previous paper @xcite , referred to as ref .",
    "[ i ] henceforth , we used a numerically exact monte carlo path integral approach ( pimc ) to capture electronic transfer ( et ) dynamics in donor - bridge - acceptor ( dba ) systems .",
    "in essence , it exploits that the path integral formulation allows for an exact elimination of the bath as well as the quasi - classical electronic degrees of freedom which reduces the dimensionality of the hilbert space considerably @xcite .",
    "the method has the merit of being applicable in the whole parameter space , that is also in those ranges where approximate methods fail , e.g.  for low frequency environments and low temperatures .",
    "it further allows to treat bridges with a larger number of electronic sites and up to sufficiently long times so that in ref .",
    "[ i ] we could investigate the length dependence of the total transfer rate from donor to acceptor , which has also been the subject of recent experiments @xcite .    in ref .",
    "[ i ] we paid particular attention to charge diffusion across a dba complex with energetically degenerated bridge states . here",
    ", we continue this study by analysing the impact of an impurity located in the center of the bridge",
    ". one may expect that the existence of a defect is the typical situation in native degenerated structures .",
    "moreover , meanwhile advanced chemical synthesis allow to `` dope '' molecular chains in a controlled way and study transport properties by linking them to external leads @xcite .",
    "the archetypical case is thereby that of a defect with an energy gap to its surrounding electronic sites as this scenario includes effectively also defects in the electronic intersite coupling .",
    "our main focus here lies on a microscopic description of the transport _ dynamics _ and the total transfer rate , which for isolated dba systems corresponds to the relaxation rate towards thermal equilibrium , and for integrated dba structures subject to a dc - voltage is related to the steady state flux @xcite . in general , the long time limit where a global thermal equilibrium state is established , can not be reached within typical times accessible in pimc simulations , however , our improved method covers time windows from which all dynamical scales including the relaxation rate can be extracted .",
    "thus , we use the exact pimc data to determine and verify a sequential transfer model and , based on this procedure , obtain a complete understanding of the dynamical features of incoherent et in dba structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we briefly outline the model for describing dissipative et dynamics in sec .",
    "[ sec : dynamics of the dissipative d - level system ] and in sec .",

    "some conclusions are given .",
    "we investigate the dynamics of a single electron moving on an impurity flawed molecular chain .",
    "the general approach to describe single charge transfer across bridges has been outlined in ref .",
    "[ i ] . here",
    ", we thus collect only the key ingredients .",
    "the molecular chain consists of @xmath1 discrete sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , where , separated by equal distances @xmath2 , @xmath3 adjacent bridge states @xmath4 are clamped between a donor @xmath5 and an acceptor state @xmath6 .",
    "the latter two are energetically degenerated and define the @xmath7-energy level .",
    "the bare bridge states are also energetically degenerated but at a higher energy @xmath8 , while the impurity , located in the center of the bridge @xmath9 , exhibits an energy gap @xmath10 with respect to the other bridge states ( we only regard chains symmetric with respect to the impurity site , i.e. with an odd number of bridge sites ) .",
    "the focus of our study lies then on the transport across the bridge / impurity compound when this gap is energetically raised or lowered .",
    "we restrict our model to nearest - neighbor coupling , that is , electronic motion is facilitated through tunneling which only occurs between adjacent states with a uniform real tunneling amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "the electronic coordinate can then be expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "the position operator thus is equivalent to the spin @xmath14 operator @xmath15 with @xmath16 denoting the ( orthonormal ) localized electronic states . in terms of electron transfer , @xmath17 and",
    "@xmath18 represent the donor and acceptor @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , while the other states are referred to as the bridge states .    the free @xmath0-level system ( @xmath0ls ) hamiltonian",
    "can then be written as ref .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 describes the energetic distribution of the electronic sites according to @xmath21 while @xmath22 governs the tunneling , @xmath23 the interaction with solvent and vibronic degrees of freedom is introduced within the framework of a system - plus - reservoir model , leading to the total hamiltonian @xcite @xmath24 here , the residual degrees of freedom are archetypically modeled as a harmonic bath coupling bilinearly to the position of the electron ( @xmath25 ) @xcite . as discussed in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , this provides a reasonably accurate description of reality for the great majority of et systems .    for the dissipative electronic dynamics we focus on the _ time - dependent site populations _ , @xmath26 which are normalized , @xmath27 , and where @xmath28 specifies the initial state of the total compound . in most theoretical and experimental works an initial separation of the electron and the environment",

    ", the description of the bath reduces to the celebrated marcus theory @xcite , where the dissipative influence onto the electronic dynamics are fully governed by the classical _ reorganization energy _ @xmath51 .",
    "we perform path - integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulations , utilizing a discretized version of the path - integral expression ( [ populations path - integral ] ) where the electronic system s path @xmath52 is replaced by @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the `` dynamical sign problem '' @xcite notorious for real - time calculations of quantum systems is significantly relieved by employing an optimized filter based on the blocking approach which exploits certain symmetries of the influence functional @xcite .",
    "besides some improvements described below , we used the same computer code as described in detail in ref .",
    "the computational bottleneck of this approach is the creation of the mc trajectory since the evaluation of each trial move requires the calculation of a series of matrix multiplications .",
    "however , here significant saving can be achieved . starting with the standard mc weight , @xmath55 where the exponential is the real part of the influence functional while the second factor represents a product of complex matrices , which include the complex valued contributions from the influence functional and the propagation of the undamped electronic system ( for details , see  ref .",
    "[ i ] app .",
    "a ) , in a first step , these matrices are stripped off all dissipative terms leading to @xmath56 now the matrices @xmath57 can be computed from the free propagator alone and thus are , unlike the @xmath58 matrices in eq .",
    "( [ mc - weight 1 ] ) , _ local in time _ in the sense that they connect only two neighboring time slices .",
    "accordingly , the former can be calculated and stored beforehand for all combinations of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , while the latter have to be recalculated every time a trial move is evaluated .",
    "the respective speed up can be multiplied by computing and storing sequences of @xmath61 matrices prior to performing the mc moves , e.g. with @xmath62 which diminishes the number of matrix multiplications necessary to obtain @xmath63 by a factor of @xmath64 .",
    "of course this approach is limited by its memory consumption which increases exponentially with @xmath0 . however , with the on - board memory facilities of nowadays computer s being in the gbyte range , it still offers tremendous performance improvements in terms of simulation duration .",
    "finally , in a last step the @xmath65 are replaced by real - valued matrices which are obtained from the former by replacing all matrix entries with their modulus . similarly to ignoring the dissipative terms present in the original @xmath58 matrices , this somewhat impairs the statistics of the pimc simulation . however , in both cases the thus necessarily larger number of accumulation processes is more than compensated by the speed up of the evaluation of the trial moves , provided the system is not too far from the coherent - incoherent transition .",
    "fortunately , far away from this transition the application of special techniques to soothe the sign problem usually is not necessary anyway .",
    "note also that the deviation of the improved mc weight  ( [ mc - weight 2a ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ mc - weight 1 ] ) decreases with increasing @xmath64 .    to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach we performed calculations both with",
    "the improved as well as with the original mc weight . for the parameters used in this paper ,",
    "the former achieved a speed up of typically a factor of 12 ; the data for @xmath66 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] , e.g. , were obtained on ibm - p615 within a cpu time of 6.2 days with @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "( [ rest vom fest ] ) and @xmath68 discretization steps on the real - time axis , where @xmath69 accumulation processes were performed ; the statistical error in the average sign was @xmath70 .",
    "for vanishing dissipation , the charge dynamics of an electron initially localized at the donor site displays coherent oscillations corresponding to no net - transfer to the acceptor site .",
    "these oscillations survive for weak coupling to an environment and sufficiently low temperatures , but with decreasing amplitude as the system relaxes towards its equilibrium state . in the sequel ,",
    "we are interested in completely incoherent transport , where , however , quantum mechanical properties of the phonon bath play a substantial role and give rise e.g.  to nuclear tunneling . according to our previous study , we consider a spectral density of the form @xmath71 where the damping strength is chosen as @xmath72 , well below the coherent - incoherent transition @xmath73 , and the cut - off frequency @xmath74 . as seen in ref .",
    "[ i ] , for these parameters coherent oscillations in the electronic dynamics show up for @xmath75 .",
    "therefore we fix the inverse temperature sufficiently above this transition at @xmath76 , which gives still rise to strong quantum effects in the bath ( @xmath77 ) though .    following these lines",
    ", we expect an initial nonequilibrium state to decay  after an initial transient on a time scale @xmath78  multi - exponentially towards thermal equilibrium . according to our previous simulations [ i ]",
    ", the equilibrium occupation probabilities are taken to be boltzmann distributed , i.e. , @xmath79 here , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 denote the populations of donor , acceptor , impurity , and the remaining bridge sites , respectively , for @xmath83 . for intermediate to long times this decay is governed by a mono - exponential relaxation with a time constant that is the inverse of the total transfer rate @xmath84 .",
    "the crucial question is then , to what extent signatures of the impurity can be detected in @xmath84 , which often is the only observable accessible in experiments . in case that the molecular chain is connected to external leads being integrated into an electrical circuit , an applied dc - voltage gives rise to a steady state with a flux that is directly related to @xmath84 @xcite .      for molecular chains with energetically degenerated bridge states , but variable length treated in ref",
    ".  [ i ] , a sequential hopping model turned out to capture the population dynamics for times beyond the transient time scale quite well .",
    "further , direct transfer populating bridge sites only virtually , known as superexchange , turned out to play no substantial role for the bath parameters specified above even for larger energy gaps between the intermediate and donor / acceptor sites .",
    "consequently , we assume first a purely sequential model to be applicable also here which is self - consistently verified by analysing the qmc data .",
    "the influence of superexchange is included in a second step .",

    "( [ differential rate equation ] ) can be derived from an exact non - local retarded master equation @xcite . due to the sequential hopping ,",
    "the intersite rates @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 should be independent of the gap energy @xmath93 of the impurity , as our simulations confirm ( see below ) .",
    "the latter one determines only @xmath94 and @xmath95 which are related by the detailed balance condition @xmath96    the intersite rates were then obtained from our qmc data by the following procedure : for increasing values of the transient time scale @xmath97 starting at @xmath98 , the populations stemming from solving eq .",
    "( [ differential rate equation ] ) with integration constants specified by the qmc results for @xmath99 were fitted to the qmc data for @xmath100 .",
    "this fixed the intersite rates as functions of the transient time scale .",
    "each true rate constant then was extracted as the plateau value of its corresponding rate function with @xmath78 as the actual transient time .",
    "the rates were fitted in sequel rather than at once .",
    "first , @xmath90 and @xmath101 were obtained from a fit to a completely degenerated bridge , i.e.  @xmath102 , with @xmath76 and @xmath103 , yielding @xmath104 which basically coincide with the golden rule values , see ref .",
    "[ i ] , eq .",
    "( 22 ) . for impurity bridges , @xmath105 ,",
    "the bridge - impurity rate @xmath94 remains thus as the only parameter in the sequential population dynamics ( [ differential rate equation ] ) . a subsequent fit yields @xmath94 as a function of the impurity offset @xmath106 .",
    "the existence of time independent intersite rates ( plateau time ) and the accuracy of this procedure proofs in turn the applicability of the hopping model .",
    "we start by presenting as an example in figs .",
    "[ fig2a ] , [ fig2b ] pimc data for the population dynamics of a bridge with @xmath107 .",
    "our simulations included bridges with @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) and gap energies between @xmath110 in steps of @xmath111 . to obtain rate constants with sufficient accuracy , the simulations had to be performed with exceptional small statistical error and up to long times @xmath112 .",
    "for example , for a typical coupling @xmath113  @xmath114 this corresponds to simulation times up to 60  ps .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we display corresponding results for @xmath94 as a function of the energy gap @xmath106 .",
    "qualitatively , the numerical rates follow the golden rule formula , but deviate , as expected , from the classical marcus expression [ see ref .",
    "[ i ] , eq .",
    "quantitatively , however , they are smaller than the golden - rule results by about 10% or less , a fact that can partly be attributed to adiabatic effects like recrossings in the landau - zener region since our bath is not strictly in the nonadiabatic limit where the golden rule expression is valid .",
    "rates for different bridge lengths differ by less than 2% outside the maximum and by about 5% at the maximum where those for shorter bridges exceed those of longer ones . in the classical limit",
    ", the pronounced maximum of @xmath115 corresponds to an activationless transfer at @xmath116 , while for @xmath117 collective quantum effects in the bath promote nuclear tunneling between adiabatic surfaces , shifting its location towards smaller gap energies ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath118 around the maximum .",
    "deviations between rates for different @xmath119 are the largest close to this maximum where adiabatic effects are expected to be the strongest as the bath is directly located around the transition point .    the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath115 is already well - known from marcus theory since the activation barrier between bridge and impurity state is a quadratic function of @xmath120 , see ref .",
    "[ i ] , eq .",
    "therefore , marcus rates show perfect symmetry with respect to @xmath121 .",
    "the fact that acceptor populations in fig .",

    "based on these results and eq .",

    "[ fig4 ] populations @xmath125 and @xmath126 for @xmath127 at fixed times but for varying @xmath106 .",
    "this gives deeper insight in how the final equilibrium populations ( [ equipops ] ) are established during the time evolution .",
    "namely , the impurity population tends to establish an exponential dependence @xmath128 on a much shorter time scale than the donor one displays a behavior @xmath129 $ ] .",
    "we will see in detail below that this is a characteristic facet of the dba dynamics .      with @xmath95 at hand , the transfer dynamics according to eq .",
    "( [ differential rate equation ] ) is known for arbitrary times . in particular",
    ", the least non - vanishing eigenvalue of the rate matrix @xmath130 defines the total transfer rate @xmath84 being typically , e.g.  for longer bridges , much smaller than the intersite rates .",
    "this way , we get access to information in the extreme long time range by extracting intersite rates from exact pimc simulations .    results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for varying gap energy @xmath106 and bridge lengths @xmath131 .",
    "as discussed , the overall values of @xmath84 are smaller by about a factor of 5 to 10 compared to the intersite hopping rates meaning that the time scales for local dynamics are well separated from global relaxation .",
    "strikingly , there is a maximum at @xmath132 which is a signature of the activationless regime found in the @xmath94 rate .",
    "hence , a defect with an appropriate negative gap enhances the global transport dynamics compared to the situation where it is absent .",
    "of course , for very large negative and positive gaps the chain is basically cut into pieces and the sequential transfer to the acceptor tends to vanish .    in our previous studies ,",
    "non - sequential electronic transport processes ( superexchange ) played only a minor role . for the range of gap energies considered in the pimc simulations , the same holds true here .",
    "since the rates gained from the pimc data are close to the golden rule rates , particularly for higher / lower impurity sites , we analyse the situation for extreme gap energies by additionally including direct transfer without populating the impurity , i.e.  from @xmath133 to @xmath134 , into the rate matrix @xmath130 via a superexchange rate @xmath135 . knowing that superexchange is relevant for high lying impurities only , we estimate @xmath135 from a quantum mechanical golden rule expression as well ( forth order perturbation theory in @xmath136 ) , see eqs .",
    "( 23 ) , ( 25 ) in ref .",
    "the corresponding @xmath137 is shown together with @xmath84 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and verifies that for the total transfer , sequential hopping dominates by far up to impurities with @xmath138 .",
    "superexchange dominates for larger gaps though , where the transport to the acceptor is almost frozen . in this latter regime _ electronic tunneling _ through",
    "the impurity exceeds the effect of _ nuclear tunneling _ in the sequential hopping mechanism .      even though the molecular bridge including the defect plays a key role in the charge transfer from donor to acceptor , typically in experiments individual bridge site populations are not accessible .",
    "thus , the question arises whether the bridge compound considered as a sub - unit of the entire molecular dba structure exhibits a characteristic dynamics on its own . for that purpose",
    ", we look at the total bridge population @xmath139 where the sum runs over all bridge sites including the impurity .",
    "clearly , due to normalization @xmath140 .    upon closer inspection",
    "one finds that due to the symmetry of the rate matrix in eq .",
    "( [ differential rate equation ] ) , every second term in @xmath141 drops out exactly so that its asymptotic dynamics is governed by the second least eigenvalue of @xmath130 , denoted by @xmath142 , instead of @xmath84 . for times beyond a certain threshold @xmath143 ,",
    "the bridge saturation can thus be captured by @xmath144\\ , { \\rm e}^{-\\gamma_{tb } ( t-\\tau_b)}\\ , \\label{asymbridge}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 ; accordingly , even if the intersite rates in @xmath130 are not known , @xmath142 can still be found by studying the saturation limit of the time dependent expression @xmath146 .",
    "this theoretical prediction from the hopping model is completely verified by the simulations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where @xmath141 for fixed gap @xmath147 is depicted as a function of time .",
    "apparently , it tends to saturate on a considerably smaller time scale than the total chain relaxes towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "an explicit value for the transient time @xmath148 is gained from the condition that the actual @xmath141 and its asymptotics ( [ asymbridge ] ) differ by less than 1% .",
    "this leads to @xmath149 which is considerably below the simulation time . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the bridge relaxation rate takes its maximum not at negative , but rather positive gap energies , where the overall transfer is slowed down . in this case",
    ", the defect facilitates as a scattering center first relaxation to its left side and then to its right one by blocking the flux to the acceptor site .",
    "note again that the asymptotic dynamics ( [ asymbridge ] ) of the total compound does not mean that the _ individual _ bridge site populations have approached their equilibrium values , too .",
    "now , for very long times @xmath150 one has @xmath151 so that then the transport across the dba complex can be described within an effective two state model with a transfer rate being identical to the total transfer rate @xmath84 extracted above , i.e. , @xmath152\\ , { \\rm e}^{-\\gamma_t ( t-\\tau_{d / a } ) } \\nonumber\\\\ p_a(t ) & = & p_d^\\infty - [ p_d(\\tau_{d / a})-p_d^\\infty]\\ , { \\rm e}^{-\\gamma_t ( t-\\tau_{d / a})}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , besides @xmath84 only information about the donor enters .",
    "further , @xmath153 ( extracted similar as described above for @xmath154 ) obeys @xmath155 and lies also well within the simulation time window , thus verifying that the pimc simulations cover the entire relevant time range .",
    "everything beyond this range is in a sense `` simple '' and completely determined by the information retrieved from the numerical data .",
    "the comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig9 ] reveals that indeed @xmath156 .    while this strong time separation is no longer true for a defect located off center , the total bridge population comes still significantly closer to its equilibrium value on a time scale much below @xmath157 than @xmath158 and @xmath159 , see fig .",
    "the remaining deviation falls off with @xmath84 , but practically eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) still gives an accurate description of the d - a transfer at long times .",
    "hence , the underlying scenario for the dba transfer is this : on an intermediate time scale @xmath160 a local steady state for the total bridge population is established , which then acts for larger times merely as an electronic reservoir mediating between d and a. in turn , the comparison between the dynamics of @xmath161 and the individual populations @xmath162 would allow experimentally to gain information about the symmetry of the bridge / defect structure . in this context it is worthwhile to mention that a symmetric situation treated here numerically is not just an idealized toy model but can actually be realized in experiments , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the above findings on the time scale separation allow for a simple recipe to successively extract rate constants from the donor and acceptor dynamics only .",
    "namely , in a first step @xmath84 is obtained from the asymptotic behavior of @xmath125 and @xmath124 .",
    "then , for a symmetric system @xmath163 allows to obtain the second least rate constant @xmath142 .",
    "further , by subtracting the dynamics corresponding to these rates from @xmath125 and @xmath124 the third least eigenvalue shows up etc .",
    "practically , this procedure works for the rate constants governing the dynamics from moderate to long times for which typically a sufficient separation of time scales is guaranteed .",
    "based on a recently improved real - time qmc scheme to treat numerically exact electronic transfer dynamics in condensed phase , we analysed the impact of an impurity on transport across molecular chains .",
    "experimentally , this is not only the typical situation in native structures , but advanced molecular synthesis even allows to assemble corresponding chains in a controlled way .",
    "we restricted our study to the case of an impurity site with an energy gap to its neighboring sites , which can be seen as the archetypical scenario as it provides e.g.  also an effective description of a defect in the electronic intersite coupling .",
    "our main focus was the total transfer rate corresponding to the time scale for global relaxation towards thermal equilibrium .",
    "since for longer bridges this time scale is in general considerably larger than the largest times accessible in real - time pimc simulations , we used the latter ones to extract , beyond a transient time , intersite hopping rates between the electronic sites .",
    "this information was then used in a sequential transfer model , verified by the pimc data , to capture the extreme long time dynamics .",
    "roughly , two dynamical ranges can be distinguished in the charge transfer : in a first step , the total bridge population approaches ( symmetric bridge / defect ) or comes close to ( asymmetric bridge / defect ) its value for thermal equilibrium facilitated by the presence of an impurity , while in a second step overall relaxation sets in associated with a characteristic unique time scale , the total transfer rate .",
    "even though the total bridge population tends to saturate in the first range , intersite relaxation between individual sites still takes place .",
    "nevertheless , the bridge compound including the impurity can basically be treated as a thermal reservoir mediating the transfer from donor to acceptor . the extent to which a time scale separation between bridge and total relaxation can be observed",
    "is directly related to the bridge / defect symmetry .",
    "the total transfer rate exhibits a pronounced maximum at negative values of the impurity energy gap , thus reflecting the enhancement of the local bridge - impurity rate in or near the activationless regime . in principle , a controlled doping with a defect site may therefore accelerate the transfer across a degenerated chain . as in our previous study , superexchange across the impurity",

    "<S> the reduced electronic dynamics is studied for various bridge lengths and defect site energies . by determining intersite hopping rates from pimc simulations up to moderate times </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation process in the extreme long time limit is captured within a sequential transfer model . the total transfer rate is extracted and shown to be enhanced for certain defect site energies . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is revealed that the entire bridge compound approaches a steady state on a much shorter time scale than that related to the total transfer which allows for a simplified description of et along donor - bridge - acceptor systems in the long time range . </S>"
