    "high - energy astrophysics focuses on the study of complex objects such as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , pulsars and gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of which comprise contributions from a number of processes @xcite , including synchrotron emission , synchrotron self - compton scattering ( ssc ) , the inverse scattering of external thermal photons from the accretion disk ( esc ) , and @xmath1 decays .",
    "these studies suffer from the existence of gaps in the sensitivity of the available instruments , such as that between the compton - scattering - based telescopes , that are mostly sensitive below 1 mev , and the pair - based telescopes , that are mostly sensitive above 100 mev .",
    "pair - based telescopes also suffer from a poor angular resolution at low energy , making the analysis of dense regions of the sky difficult .",
    "in this paper we present a characterization of the use of a thin detector as an active target for cosmic @xmath0-ray detection in the pair - conversion regime , with the aim of improving the angular resolution and the sensitivity at low energy .",
    "the past missions and the presently operated fermi / lat and agile use thick detectors for which the photon conversion probability is close to unity and the effective area @xmath2 is the product of the geometrical area of the detector @xmath3 and of the reconstruction efficiency @xmath4 : @xmath5 . in a thin detector for which the conversion probability is small , the effective area becomes proportional to the pair conversion mass attenuation coefficient @xmath6 and to the detector mass @xmath7 , @xmath8 . in a thick detector ,",
    "the optimization of the aspect ratio height / surface is therefore critical , while for a thin detector it does not affect the effective area to first order .",
    "note that in a thick detector , the various possible conversion processes are in competition with each other , and compton scattering prior to- or in place of- pair conversion would become a problem at the lowest energy if low @xmath9 material were considered , an effect strongly reduced for a thin detector .",
    "a sample of previous works on the use of gas detectors for the detection of cosmic @xmath0 rays above the pair - creation threshold , sometimes in relation with a compton telescope , can be found in refs .",
    "we use a time projection chamber ( tpc ) as a test model of a thin detector .",
    "a tpc is a chunk of homogeneous matter , located inside a ( say ) uniform electric field @xmath10",
    "( @xcite , and a recent review @xcite ) . charged tracks crossing the tpc ionize atoms / molecules on their path , after which the ionization electrons drift to the anode plane where ( in a gas tpc ) they are amplified , and collected .",
    "the collecting plane can be segmented so as to provide two coordinates @xmath11 of the location of the ionization .",
    "the third coordinate @xmath12 is provided by the drift time @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the drift velocity @xmath15 ranges from @xmath16 at saturation for liquids and solids , to @xmath17 for gases when used with an appropriate quencher , a multi - atomic molecule on which drifting electrons collide and are cooled down .",
    "the size of the electron `` cloud '' increases during the drift due to diffusion , which places a limit to the useable drift length .",
    "the typical value of the diffusion coefficient is @xmath18 for the three phases considered here .",
    "note that amplification of the signal is easily performed in a gas , but not in a liquid .",
    "the smallness of the collected signal @xmath19 in liquid argon ( lar ) and the limitation of the electrical power available in space for the digitization electronics would make precision tracking difficult . to alleviate this limitation ,",
    "double - phase systems have been developed : the electrons are extracted from a liquid tpc into a gas in which they are amplified efficiently @xcite .",
    "but for a use in space , the instability of the gas / liquid interface would be a problem .",
    "a gas / solid system might be considered such as solid argon and a neon - based gas .",
    "the density and electron parameters of noble - gas solid and liquid are close enough that we neglect the difference and we use the liquid as representing the two dense phases .",
    "these analytical results are exemplified numerically for a few sets of detector parameters : three noble gases : neon , argon and xenon ; three `` densities '' : gas at 1 and 10 bar , and liquid .",
    "we chose on purpose rather modest detector parameters , a detector mass @xmath20 and a tracking length of @xmath21 for gas , @xmath22 and @xmath23 for liquid , except in the case where the radiation length @xmath24 would be shorter than @xmath25 : in that case the propagation of an electron would be affected by radiation after a path length of the order of @xmath24 , and we use @xmath26 .",
    "the tracking length @xmath25 is obviously related to the detector thickness , but they can be different , as in the case of liquid xenon . the sensitive mass for a gas tpc is chosen to be smaller due to the volume limitation of space missions .",
    "we use typical values for the longitudinal sampling of the tpc , @xmath27 , and of the point space resolution , @xmath28 .",
    "we consider a photon with energy @xmath29 converting to an electron - positron pair in the field of a charged particle of the detector .",
    "the conversion is said to be `` nuclear '' in the case of an ion , @xmath30 , and `` triplet '' in the case of an electron @xmath31 . from momentum conservation",
    ": @xmath32 we can identify several contributions to the photon angular resolution : ( 1 ) the single track angular resolution ; ( 2 ) the fact that , in the case of nuclear conversion , the recoil momentum @xmath33 of the ion , of the order of @xmath34 produces a path length that is too small to allow a measurement of @xmath33 ; ( 3 ) the resolution of the norm of the momentum , named here the momentum resolution , for each of the hard tracks",
    ". we examine these three contributions in the following .",
    "the basis of the understanding of tracking in the presence of multiple scattering was settled by gluckstern @xcite .",
    "we make use of the similar results derived by innes for optimal fits @xcite .",
    "we use an approximation of the multiple scattering angle @xmath35 undergone by a particle of momentum @xmath36 crossing a slab of matter with thickness @xmath37 @xcite : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and we have neglected the negative logarithmic correction factor . at high momentum , multiple scattering can be neglected and the detector resolution dominates @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of samplings , @xmath42 . in the expressions of @xmath43",

    "( [ eq : multiple : scattering : base ] ) , we obtain : @xmath47    the expression does not depend on the tracking length .",
    "this is because the end of the track contributes no information about the particle s direction at the detector entrance once there has been sufficient scattering @xcite .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence on momentum obtained here is comparable to the @xmath49 dependence on energy parametrized by the fermi collaboration @xcite .",
