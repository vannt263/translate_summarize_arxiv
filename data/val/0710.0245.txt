    "quark masses are fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) and thus it is desirable to determine their numerical values with the highest possible precision . in order to do so",
    "it is necessary to fix a renormalisation scheme which defines the quark mass .",
    "often physical observables are expressed through some `` short distance '' mass  @xcite to obtain predictions which are free of the renormalon problem .",
    "to do so , one frequently needs the relation between the on - shell and the @xmath0 mass .",
    "many authors contributed to the latter task  @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we present the recently published calculation  @xcite , where we have included the effect of a second nonzero quark mass to the relation between the quarks in those two schemes at the three loop level . after having reduced the problem to the calculation of master integrals we use two different ways to solve them , namely the differential equation and the mellin - barnes method . from the phenomenological point of view",
    "this result is important for the bottom - quark including effects from virtual charm - quarks . as a byproduct",
    "we also obtain the corresponding contribution to the wave function renormalisation constant .",
    "introducing the decomposition of the quark self - energy @xmath1 we can express the renormalisation constants , which are defined through @xmath2 by  @xcite @xmath3 @xmath4 is the quark field renormalised in the on - shell scheme with mass @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the on - shell mass and bare quantities are denoted by a subscript 0 .",
    "thus , to obtain @xmath7 one only needs to calculate @xmath8 for @xmath9 . to calculate @xmath10 ,",
    "one has to compute the first derivative of the self - energy diagrams .",
    "the mass renormalisation is taken into account iteratively by calculating one- and two - loop diagrams with zero - momentum insertions .    in the case of the mass renormalisation",
    "it is convenient to consider the ratio between the on - shell and @xmath11 renormalisation constants @xmath12 which is finite .",
    "here we have introduced the renormalisation dependent @xmath11-mass @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath7 the wave function renormalisation constant contains next to ultraviolet also infrared divergences .",
    "thus it is not possible to construct a finite quantity by considering the ratio between the on - shell and @xmath11 renormalisation constant .",
    "= 1    in order to compute the on shell self energy we use qgraf  @xcite to generate the feynman diagrams and the various topologies are identified with the help of q2e and exp  @xcite . in a next step",
    "the reduction of the various functions to so - called master integrals ( mi s ) has to be achieved .",
    "for this step we use the so - called laporta method  @xcite which reduces the three - loop integrals to 26 mi s .",
    "we use the implementation of laporta s algorithm in the program crusher  @xcite .",
    "it is written in c++ and uses ginac  @xcite for simple manipulations like taking derivatives of polynomial quantities . in the practical implementation of the laporta algorithm one of the most time - consuming operations",
    "is the simplification of the coefficients appearing in front of the individual integrals .",
    "this task is performed with the help of fermat  @xcite where a special interface has been used ( see ref .",
    "the main features of the implementation are the automated generation of the integration - by - parts ( ibp ) identities  @xcite , a complete symmetrisation of the diagrams and the possibility to use multiprocessor environments .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::mi ] a graphical representation of the master integrals can be found . as indicated in the figure ,",
    "many topologies contain more than one master integral .",
    "we have chosen two independent ways to compute the @xmath14-expansion of the master integrals .",
    "the first one relies on the differential equation method  @xcite . with this method",
    "we were able to evaluate all but four master integrals in analytic form . with the help of our second method , based on the mellin - barnes technique ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) we can get numerical results for all master integrals .",
    "here we have used the mathematica package mb.m  @xcite .",
    "first we set up differential equations in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the second nonzero quark mass , for each of the individual integrals .",
    "each equation will contain the master integral itself and integrals belonging to the corresponding topology .",
    "the latter can again be reduced to the set of master integrals .",
    "for all the topologies which contain only one master integral ( e.g. all six - propagator integrals in fig .",
    "[ fig::mi ] ) this gives a ",
    "simple  equation whereas for the other topologies we get two or three coupled equations , respectively . in the next step",
    "we expand the differential equations in @xmath14 . choosing an appropriate basis for the master integrals , all equations decouple order by order in @xmath14 .",
    "we can now solve for all integrals by repeated use of euler s variation of the constant method .",
    "the initial conditions we need are all known from the literature  @xcite .",
    "we were able to get analytical results for all master integrals in terms of harmonic polylogarithms ( hpl s  @xcite ) up to order @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately we were not yet able to get analytical results in higher orders in @xmath14 for the four integrals belonging to the two topologies depicted as the leftmost ones in the second row of fig .",
    "[ fig::mi ] . for all other integrals we provide analytical results up to the order we need in our calculation . to calculate the mi s in terms of hpl s",
    "it is necessary that the ( pseudo)poles in the corresponding differential equations are all of the form @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , were these poles can occur up to arbitrary order .",
    "this is the case in all topologies except for the ones mentioned above .",
    "we have not found a proper change of variables to bring the differential equation into this form . as a consequence we only managed to integrate the integrals in these topologies up to the order @xmath17 .",
    "the remaining parts can e.g. be integrated numerically with mathematica .    to evaluate our results numerically and for general algebraic manipulations of terms involving hpl s we use the mathematica package hpl  @xcite .",
    "the mellin - barnes method as a tool for the evaluation of feynman integrals has become very popular in the recent years .",
    "the basic formula is @xcite @xmath21 which transforms a propagator like term into a complex contour integral .",
    "a common recipe to evaluate feynman integrals is the following : first one introduces feynman parameters for a loop variable .",
    "then one can perform the corresponding momentum integration .",
    "after that one applies formula ( [ eq::mb - basic ] ) to the denominators containing the feynman parameters . finally the feynman parameters can be integrated yielding the mellin - barnes representation of the original integral",
    ". this procedure has recently been automatised @xcite .",
    "the mellin - barnes integration is to be performed along a contour which reaches from @xmath22 to @xmath23 on the imaginary axis with indentations such that the poles of @xmath24 and those of @xmath25 are separated by the contour .",
    "mellin - barnes integrals usually have singularities for certain values of their parameters .",
    "if there are for example gamma functions of the form @xmath26 , it is not possible to find an appropriate integration contour when @xmath27 .",
    "the integral is therefore singular in @xmath14 and this is how uv poles of feynman integrals manifest themselves in their mellin - barnes representation .",
    "one has thus to regularise the integral , that is , identify the @xmath14 poles .",
    "this can be done by shifting the integration contour using the residue theorem .",
    "prescriptions to do so have been given in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the latter has been automatised , see refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally the regularised integrals can be expanded in @xmath14 and evaluated by numerical integration , which is also implemented in the package mb.m @xcite , or by application of the residue theorem and summing up the residues .",
    "depending on the dimension of the integrals and the complexity of the integrand this can be done numerically or analytically .    to calculate the master integrals for this work",
    "we first simplified the mellin - barnes integrals by inserting the representations of known subtopologies .",
    "the regularisation has been done partly using mb.m and the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite . one- and two - dimensional mb - integrals were calculated via their sum representation , higher dimensional integrals using mb.m .",
    "the 4-line integrals can all be represented as mellin - barnes - integrals of maximal dimension 1 , which can be evaluated as single sums .",
    "for the 5 line master integrals we find representations of dimension 2 to 5 .",
    "the integrals with 6 lines have 3 to 5 dimensional representations .",
    "we find good agreement with the results obtained from the differential equation method .",
    "inserting the results for the master integrals into the final result we observe large numerical cancellations near @xmath28 between the contributions originating from different master integrals . on the other hand",
    ", the expansion for @xmath29 converges very fast , which is relevant for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "for this reason we decided to derive an expansion of our result including eighth order terms .",
    "the coefficients that could not be obtained analytically can be evaluated numerically from their mellin - barnes - representation , which is in our case at most two - dimensional .",
    "as an application of our result we want to discuss the charm quark effects in the relations between the pole , the @xmath11 and the @xmath32 quark mass .",
    "for illustration we use @xmath33  gev , @xmath34  gev , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . the relation between the on - shell and the @xmath11 mass leads to @xmath37 \\mbox{gev }    \\ , ,    \\label{eq::mosmms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tree - level , one- , two- and three - loop results are shown separately .",
    "the contributions from the charm quark mass which vanish for @xmath38 are marked by a subscript @xmath39 .",
    "one observes that the higher order contributions are significant .",
    "in particular , the two - loop charm quark effects amount to 9  mev and the three - loop ones to 18  mev .",
    "a similar bad convergence is observed in the relation between the @xmath32 mass  @xcite @xmath40 and the pole mass @xmath41 . for @xmath42  gev , @xmath34  gev , @xmath43 and @xmath44 it is given by @xmath45 \\mbox{gev }    \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq::m1smos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] however , the relation between the @xmath32 and the @xmath11 quark mass is much better behaved as can be seen in the following example where we have chosen @xmath46  gev , @xmath34  gev , @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 \\mbox{gev }    \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq::mmsm1s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the two - loop charm effects amount to only 4.7  mev and three - loop ones to 5.1  mev .",
    "we want to mention that in case only the linear approximation  @xcite of the charm quark mass effects is used the corresponding three - loop results in eqs .",
    "( [ eq::mosmms ] ) and  ( [ eq::mmsm1s ] ) read @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
