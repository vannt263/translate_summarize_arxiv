    "as suggested by the inventors of qcd  @xcite , the colour symmetry of the theory is , conventionally , assumed to be unbroken , so that , theoretically  @xcite , the gluon is supposed to have a vanishing mass .",
    "it was also conjectured , by the same authors , that the resulting infra - red divergences of the theory at large distances ( ` infra - red slavery ' ) might explain the confinement of quarks . as is also well known , in the contrary case that gluons are massive",
    ", there is a possible breakdown of renormalisability as well as violation of unitarity at high energy by certain tree level amplitudes .",
    "these problems are common to all non - abelian gauge theories with massive vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "these problems may be solved , as in the standard electroweak model , by the introduction , also for the strong interaction , of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the higgs mechanism  @xcite . since",
    ", however , there is no experimental evidence for the existence of a higgs boson for the strong interaction , or for electrically charged gluons , which are also predicted by some of these ` broken colour ' theories , it is still generally supposed , in spite of the infra - red divergent nature of such a theory , that the qcd colour symmetry remains unbroken .    a possible way out of this dilemma ( infra - red divergences if the gluon mass is zero , breakdown of renormalisabilty and unitarity if it is not ) was suggested by cornwall  @xcite who suggested that non - vanishing gluon mass might be dynamically generated in a theory in which the colour gauge symmetry remained unbroken .",
    "other authors  @xcite pointed out that a gauge invariant , renormalisable and infra - red finite , version of qcd with massive gluons is possible , provided that a suitable four - vertex faddeev - popov ghost field is introduced into the theory .",
    "the aim of the present paper is not to pursue further these theoretical considerations , but rather to seek _ direct experimental evidence _ on the mass of the gluon .",
    "the processes considered , the radiative decays of ground state vector heavy quarkonia into a photon and light hadrons , are particularly well adapted to such a study , as the observed final state results from the hadronisation of a pure two gluon final state at the lowest order in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "these are the ` golden ' physical processes for the determination of the gluon mass , that may be compared to the neutral kaon system for the study of cp violation or tritium @xmath13-decay for the direct determination of the mass of the electron antineutrino .",
    "indeed , the analogy between the process @xmath0 and tritium @xmath13-decay is a very close one . in both cases",
    "it is the study of the end - point region of a spectrum ( that of the electron for tritium @xmath13-decay , of the photon for the radiative @xmath4 decay ) that give the mass limits on the @xmath14 or the gluon mass .",
    "the @xmath4 , being the lightest quarkonia is the most sensitive to the gluon mass , just as the tritium @xmath13-decay , with a very low energy release , gives the best direct limit on the @xmath14 mass . indeed , as will be shown below , the suppression of the spectrum end point due to gluon mass effects , is much more severe in the case of @xmath4 radiative decays than for the heavier @xmath5 state .    already in 1980 ,",
    "parisi and petronzio  @xcite(pp ) had suggested a mass of @xmath15 800 mev for the gluon , on the basis of the strong suppression of the end point of the photon spectrum in radiative @xmath4 decays , as measured by the mark ii collaboration  @xcite . in order to relate ,",
    "however , in a precise way , the shape of the photon spectrum to the gluon mass , two other important physical effects , which also soften the shape of the photon spectrum , must also be properly accounted for .",
    "these are : ( i ) relativistic corrections and ( ii ) higher order qcd corrections .",
    "because of the only recently available complete next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) pqcd calculation of the photon spectrum in the decays @xmath1  @xcite and a much improved understanding of the phenomenology of relativistic corrections based on several recent and independent potential model calculations , the analysis presented below is the first to take fully into account the important effects ( i ) and ( ii ) and so confirm the conclusion of pp that the gluon mass is @xmath15 1 gev . at the time of writing , no calculation yet exists in which the effects ( i ) and ( ii ) , as well as that of the gluon mass are taken into account in a unified way , so the present analysis is inevitably a phenomenological one where the three different types of corrections are assumed , loosely speaking , to ` factorise ' .",
    "since , however , it is clear that the gluon mass effects are , by far , the most important , no large uncertainity on the results obtained are expected to result from this approximation .",
    "the results presented below also confirm the conclusions of two previous , closely related , papers written by m.consoli and the present author  @xcite(mcjhf1,mcjhf2 ) .",
    "some brief comments are made here on these papers : some more detailed remarks are made in section 8 below .    in mcjhf1",
    "effective gluon masses , @xmath16 , determined from fits to @xmath0 and @xmath1 were used , in conjunction with gluon mass correction factors calculated by pp ( or re - calculated using pure phase - space considerations ) to derive a large number of @xmath9 values from different charmonium and bottomonium branching ratios .",
    "agreement with the expected pqcd evolution of @xmath9 from the scale @xmath17 to @xmath18 was only obtained when the gluon mass corrections were applied .",
    "also , only in this case , was good agreement found between the derived values of @xmath9 and those obtained from deep inlastic scattering experiments . in this paper only the photiadis  @xcite higher order ( ho ) qcd correction ( that is only applicable in the end - point region of the photon spectrum , and does not include real gluon radiation effects ) was used , and relativistic corrections were completely neglected .    the second paper , mcjhf2 , made essential use of the recently proposed non - relativistic quantum chromodynamics ( nrqcd ) formalism of bodwin , braaten and lepage ( bbl )  @xcite , in which both non - relativistic and ho qcd corrections ( but not gluon mass effects ) were treated in a rigorous way , order - by - order in perturbation theory , using an operator product expansion . as suggested by bbl , the values of @xmath9 , and the leading relativistic correction parameter @xmath19 were treated as free parameters in fits to various charmonium and bottomonium decay widths .",
    "similar fits were also performed to the inclusive photon spectra in @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "no consistent values of @xmath20 and @xmath9 were found in the absence of gluon mass corrections .",
    "when the latter were included , consistent values of @xmath9 similar to those found in mcjhf1 were obtained . however , in this case , the values of @xmath20 were found to be much smaller in absolute value than the expectations from potential model calculations , and even ( as discussed further in section 8 below ) of the wrong sign .",
    "the conclusion concerning the inability of the nrqcd formalism to describe the experimental data , in the absence of gluon mass corrections , was not however affected by the incorrect treatment of relativistic corrections .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "sections 2 , 3 and 4 are devoted to descriptions of the implementation of relativistic , ho qcd and gluon mass corrections respectively",
    ". fits to the experimental data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 to obtain , in each case , the corresponding effective gluon mass @xmath16 , are described in sections 5 and 6 .",
    "section 7 describes the determination of @xmath21 and @xmath22 from the experimental branching ratios @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the values of @xmath9 obtained in this way are unaffected by relativistic corrections . in section 8 , the effective gluon mass values obtained in this paper",
    "are compared with other estimates of the gluon mass in the literature .",
    "finally section 9 contains a brief summary and outlook .",
    "details of the method used to simulate the effects of experimental resolution on the inclusive photon spectrum are given in an appendix .",
    "._estimations of @xmath25 for the @xmath26 and the @xmath27 _ [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     pioneering work in this field was done by pp  @xcite .",
    "an estimate of @xmath28 mev for the gluon mass was made from the observed softening of the end - point of the inclusive photon spectrum in radiative @xmath4 decays .",
    "the work presented in this paper is , in essence , a more refined version of the analysis of pp , taking into account experimental resolution effects , and the including @xmath5 decays as well as the best current knowledge on relativistic and ho qcd corrections .",
    "the first extended theoretical discussion of gluon mass effects within qcd was made by cornwall  @xcite .",
    "estimates were made of the possible value of a dynamically generated gluon mass by several different methods : phenomenological glueball regularisation , considerations based on the gluon condensate , the glueball spectrum and lattice gauge calculations .",
    "in fact , many of the gluon mass estimates shown in table 15 are based on the use of the gluon condensate : @xmath29|0\\rangle = m^4_cf(\\frac{x^2}{a^2})\\ ] ] introduced by shiftman , vainstein and zakharov ( svz )  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath30 is the gluon field tensor .",
    "the gluon mass is related to the inverse of the correlation length , @xmath31 , of the gluonic vacuum fields . in reference",
    "@xcite the phenomenological determination of @xmath32 by the use of qcd sum rules is described .",
    "donnachie and landshoff  @xcite , identified the pomeron trajectory , used to describe diffractive scattering , with the qcd two gluon exchange process  @xcite .",
    "they modified the perturbative gluon propagator in the long distance region by introducing a finite correlation length .",
    "the value of the latter was derived from phenomenological pomeron exchange parameters . in table 15",
    "the reciprocal of the correlation length is equated to the gluon mass .",
    "other studies of the sensitivity of the pomeron parameters to non - perturbative modifications of the gluon propagator were made by hancock and ross  @xcite and nickolaev _ et al . _",
    "again , an effective gluon mass of about 800 mev was found .",
    "spiridonov and chetyrkin  @xcite estimated the gluon mass by calculating power corrections to the polarisation tensor @xmath33 of the electromagnetic current of light quarks , and identifying them with the gluon condensate term in the operator product expansion ( ope ) for this quantity derived by svz .",
    "the calculation was later repeated by liu and wetzel  @xcite , who obtained a very similar , though not identical , result ( see below ) .",
    "lavelle  @xcite , by considering a long - distance modification of the gluon propagator in the amplitude for quark - quark scattering , established a relation between a running , dynamically generated , gluon mass and the gluon condensate of svz .",
    "it was emphasised by lavelle that the derived formula , based on the ope is only valid in the deep euclidean region .",
    "even so , in a recent paper mihara and natale ( mn )  @xcite applied the running gluon mass formula of lavelle to decays of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 to ggg of @xmath34gg where the gluons are either on shell or have time - like virtualities .",
    "mn concluded that the average effective gluon mass should be smaller for @xmath5 than for @xmath4 decays , at variance with the results of the fits presented in the present paper .",
    "the correction factors due to gluon mass effects : @xmath35 were calculated for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 and found to be 0.47 @xmath36 0.30 and 0.94 @xmath36 0.03 respectively , to be compared with the values found here ( see table 11 ) of 0.18 + 0.08 - 0.02 and 0.61 + 0.16 - 0.06 . the smaller gluon mass corrections found by mn are unable to explain the large differences in the values of @xmath37 determined from @xmath38 and the the world average value of @xmath9 ( see table 10 and fig.7 ) .",
    "the gluon mass estimates presented in table 15 are , with one exception , in the range from a few hundred mev to about 1.5 gev .",
    "the exception is the paper of yndurin  @xcite which claims that experimental upper bounds in the range from 20 mev to 10@xmath39 mev may be set .",
    "these limits are based on considerations of the quantum mechanical potential between a quark and an anti - quark .",
    "this is assumed to be coulombic for short distances @xmath20 ( @xmath40 ) where @xmath41 is the qcd scale parameter , linear (  @xmath42 ) for @xmath43 and , finally , for @xmath44 , to exhibit a yukawa form : @xmath45 .",
    "the linear portion of the potential gives rise to a barrier of height @xmath46 .",
    "yndurin argues that @xmath47 may be identified with the highest energy at which unsuccessful searches for liberated quarks have been performed .",
    "for example , @xmath48 gev leads to the limit : @xmath49 other limits are given by applying similar arguments to the absence of proton decay into free quarks ( @xmath50 mev ) , and the non - observation of free quarks on cosmological scales ( @xmath51 mev ) .",
    "the arguments leading to these limits are clearly untenable because of the neglect of the quantum field theory ( qft ) aspects of the problem derived from a pure quantum mechanical potential . in the real world",
    "it is impossible to deconfine a quark since the production of low mass @xmath52 pairs ( mesons ) is always energetically favoured . ] .",
    "in fact , when a colour field is stretched between a quark and an anti - quark , the number of colour charges is not conserved .",
    "the vacuum energy materialises as quark - antiquark pairs , which form bound states of light mesons ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 , ... ) this mechanism , as implemented in the jetset monte carlo program  @xcite is found to give a good description of the observed hadron multiplicity in @xmath55 , where the final state is just a colour singlet @xmath56 pair of the type discussed by yndurin .",
    "this neglect of the qft aspects of the problem renders it unecessary to discuss further the contradiction between yndurin s upper limits and the other gluon mass estimates in table 15 .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that the paper of yndurin is the only one cited on the subject of experimental limits on the gluon mass in the current review of particle properties  @xcite .",
    "the estimations of the gluon mass based on the phenomenologically determined value of the gluon condensate  @xcite cited in table 15 are , with one exception , in the range from 500 - 700 mev . as discussed above , such a value for the gluon mass could not explain the much stronger suppression of the end point of the inclusive photon spectrum in @xmath4 decays , as compared to @xmath5 decays .",
    "the exception , that is much more consistent with the gluon mass value suggested by the radiative decays , is the calculation of kogan and kovner  @xcite .",
    "this uses an analytical approach in which the vacuum energy of a gauge - invariant qcd wave functional is minimised .",
    "it leads to the relation , for a pure su(3 ) yang - mills theory : @xmath57 substituting the value of @xmath32 of 0.038 gev@xmath58 from reference  @xcite gives @xmath59 gev .",
    "this value is quite consistent with the effective gluon masses derived earlier  @xcite and confirmed in the present study .",
    "it also agrees well with a previous , independent , estimate of the present author , based on a pqcd analysis of several processes with low physical scales  @xcite , and a recent lattice gauge estimate  @xcite .",
    "an effective gluon mass has also been introduced in the context of the estimation of power - corrections to various hard qcd processes  @xcite .",
    "this was already briefly discussed in mcjhf2 . the leading correction to the mean thrust in @xmath60 annihilation into hadrons , for example ,",
    "is found to be @xmath61 .",
    "the gluon mass appears as an intermediate parameter in these calculations , but no explicit values are quoted , and to date , no comparisons have been made with other estimates of the effective gluon mass , e.g. lattice calculations .",
    "power corrections are an example of ` higher twist ' effects in the language of the ope formalism .",
    "in fact , it was pointed out in reference  @xcite that , as a consequence of the dimensionality of the relevant operators , physical systems described by an ope ( as in the case of qcd sum rules ) are expected to have a leading power correction @xmath62 . a ope description , as used in qcd sum rules , is not appropriate to describe higher twist effects in the quarkonium radiative decay spectrum discussed in the present paper .",
    "as can be seen by inspection of eqns.(7.5 ) and ( 7.6 ) the leading higher twist effects are @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "the gluon mass estimate labelled ` pqcd at low scales ' in table 15 , is based on phenomenological arguments ( similar to those used later in reference  @xcite ) , proposed in reference  @xcite and further developed in references  @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "effective gluon and quark masses are related to the qcd @xmath65 parameter , that plays the role of an infra - red cut - off of the theory .",
    "it is interesting to note that the approach just mentioned , which relates the @xmath65 parameter of pqcd to effective quark and gluon masses , is complementary to the svz approach of describing the perturbative / non - perturbative interface in terms of qcd sum rules . in this context",
    "it is interesting to consider the relation between @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath66  @xcite : @xmath67 the value @xmath68 mev quoted in table 15 , was obtained by setting @xmath69 gev in eqn(8.3 ) , but the equation is expected to be valid for any value of @xmath70 in the perturbative region . substituting the values @xmath71 gev , @xmath72 and @xmath73 gev , which reproduce well the measured value of @xmath74  @xcite , into eqn(8.3 ) gives , for the gluon condensate , @xmath75 ( gev)@xmath58 , which may be compared with the average value derived by narison  @xcite of @xmath76 ( gev)@xmath58 .",
    "liu and wetzel  @xcite derived a formula identical to eqn(8.3 ) except that the term 23/2 is replaced by 10 . with the same parameters as quoted above , the value @xmath77 ( gev)@xmath58 is obtained . in view of the @xmath15 factor of two difference between the original svz estimation of the numerical value of @xmath32 , as compared to that of narison , the overall consistency of the value of @xmath32 derived from the qcd sum rule approach , and the pqcd phenomenology of reference  @xcite , is very satisfactory .",
    "thus , although gluon mass effects are only _ directly _ observable in processes with pure gluonic parton - level final states , such as the radiative heavy quarkonia decays analysed in detail in this paper , the existence of a gluon mass of order one gev is already implicit in all pqcd analyses that use , as an infra - red cut - off , the conventional @xmath65 parameter .",
    "it is important to stress , however , that as previously pointed out  @xcite , the scale at which pqcd is expected to break down is @xmath15 gluon mass @xmath10 gev , _ not _",
    "@xmath41 , which is typically a factor of five smaller .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same conclusion has recently been reached in a study of the five - loop qcd @xmath13-function , using pad - approximant methods  @xcite . from this point - of - view the success of pqcd , in association with the lphd hypothesis , in describing observed particle multiplicity distributions , as well as their energy dependence , using cut - off scales @xmath78 as low as 270 or even 150 mev  @xcite , seems somewhat mysterious and",
    "may be accidental .",
    "as previously mentioned , monte - carlo generators that actually simulate in detail both the partonic and hadronic phases of the space - time evolution of the final state use infra - red cut - off parameters of about 1 - 2 gev , of the same order as the observed gluon mass .",
    "since the main effect of the inclusion of a phenomenological gluon mass on the qcd predictions is phase spaee suppression , it is clear that the associated mass must be time - like : @xmath79 .",
    "this behaviour is also consistent with an analytical parameterisation of the lattice results of reference  @xcite .",
    "another recent lattice study using a coulomb gauge gluon propagator  @xcite has suggested rather a _ pure imaginary _ pole mass : @xmath80 mev .",
    "this work is related to the suggestion of gribov  @xcite that colour confinement is due to a long range coulomb force . in this model",
    "physical ( transverse ) gluons disappear form the physical spectrum in the infra - red region .",
    "this would appear to be at variance with the essential role of massive , time - like , and dominantly transverse , physical gluons in the description of inclusive photon spectra that is demonstrated in the present paper .",
    "actually , renormalisability remains to be proved for the coulomb gauge and , as pointed out by the authors of reference  @xcite , except possibly in a confined phase , in quantum field theory the square of a particle mass identified with the pole of a propagator must be real and positive .",
    "the author s opinion is that pure quantum field theory studies of the type carried out by gribov and zwanziger  @xcite are no better adapted than the quantum mechanical potential model of yndurin  @xcite , discussed above , to understand the physical mechanism of confinement .",
    "this appears to occur via a transition beween partonic and hadronic phases of matter , after which colour charges are all confined within hadrons , which are mostly bound states of quarks .",
    "clearly quenched lattice calulations of the type done in reference  @xcite are unable to describe such a mechanism .",
    "it has recently been pointed out that the introduction of a term containing a tachyonic gluon mass @xmath81 with @xmath82 gev@xmath83 in the ope of qcd sum rules is able to explain some long standing puzzles in the related phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "this approach was justified by evidence from lattice gauge calculations for non - perturbative contributions leading to a linearly increasing term in the static qcd potential at short distances  @xcite .",
    "the connection of this gluon mass parameter , which gives an economical description , within the qcd sum rule formalism , of a non perturbative _ short distance _",
    "effect with the time - like effective mass discussed in the present paper ( and all references cited in table 15 ) , is unclear .",
    "this latter mass describes rather the _ long distance _",
    "behaviour of the gluon propagator .",
    "it is quite possible that both the time - like and tachyonic gluon masses may be appropriate and consistent phenomenological parameters within their different domains of applicablity .",
    "in this paper a phenomenological qcd analysis has been performed using all available data on the inclusive photon spectrum in the decays of the @xmath4 ( mark ii collaboration ) and the @xmath5 ( cusb , argus , crystal ball and cleo2 collaborations ) .",
    "the fits performed to the shape of the spectra included , for the first time , the combined contributions of relativistic corrections , nlo pqcd corrections , and corrections due to the non - vanishing gluon mass . for the relativistic correction , fixed values of @xmath25 of 0.28 , and",
    "0.09 were assumed for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 repectively , in accordance with recent potential model calculations .",
    "both the new , complete , nlo pqcd calculation by krmer  @xcite of the @xmath5 photon spectrum and the old resummed calculation of photiadis  @xcite ( applicable only in the end - point region @xmath84 ) were used in the fits .",
    "gluon mass effects were estimated using the complete tree - level calculation of @xmath85 of liu and wetzel  @xcite .    for neither the @xmath4 nor the @xmath5 was any consistent description of the experimental data possible in the absence of gluon mass corrections .",
    "in this case , for the mark ii data , no fit was obtained with a confidence level greater than 10@xmath86 ( table 5 ) . for the @xmath5 , acceptable confidence levels of 0.17 and 0.13 were found for some fits to the crystal ball and cleo2 data , but not for argus where the best confidence level obtained was @xmath87 ( table 7 ) .",
    "however the best confidence level for the combined fit to these three experiments was only @xmath88 .",
    "including gluon mass corrections yielded confidence levels of greater than 1@xmath89 for all the fit hypotheses tried ( see tables 6 and 8) and values of the effective gluon mass , @xmath16 , of : @xmath90 the first errors quoted are experimental , and correspond to the 68@xmath89 error contour of the fit , while the second errors are theoretical , reflecting the spread in the best fit values of @xmath16 resulting from different treatments of relativistic and ho pqcd corrections .",
    "it is clear from the fit results shown in tables 6 and 8 that the shape of the photon spectrum for both the @xmath4 and the @xmath5 is completely dominated by gluon mass effects . introducing the relativistic correction leaves the fitted values of @xmath16 almost unchanged , while the shifts produced by different ho pqcd corrections are less than , or comparable to , the fit errors .",
    "the gluon mass corrections are due essentially to phase space restrictions .",
    "including or excluding contributions from longitudinal gluon polarisation states changes the fitted values of @xmath16 by only @xmath91 .",
    "it can be seen , from the theoretical photon spectra calculated including the effects given by the experimentally determined values of @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "11 ) , that the suppresssion of the end point of the spectrum is much stronger in the case of the @xmath4 , than that of the @xmath5 .",
    "this is in contradiction with the prediction of the qcd parton shower model of r.d.field  @xcite that agrees well with the measured @xmath5 spectrum , but predicts , for the @xmath4 , a much harder spectrum than that actually observed .",
    "such a strong suppression of the @xmath4 end - point , in comparison with that of the @xmath5 is only possible if the gluon mass is @xmath15 1 gev . all these conclusions are in agreement with those of two earlier , closely related , papers  @xcite , in which it was conjectured , following the work of parisi and petronzio  @xcite , that gluon mass corrections must be much more important than either relativistic of ho pqcd corrections in determining the shapes of the inclusive photon spectra .",
    "the qcd coupling constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 were determined from the experimental measurements of the branching ratio @xmath38 ( eqn .",
    "7.1 ) for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "use of @xmath38 has the advantage of being insensitive to relativistic correction effects . as shown in fig .",
    "7 , even allowing for a variation of the renormalisation scale in the range from @xmath94 to @xmath95 , poor agreement ( deviations of @xmath96 for the @xmath4 , @xmath5 respectively ) is found with the current world average value of @xmath97 . using the measured @xmath16 values to calculate the gluon mass correction factors in the theoretical expressions for @xmath38 ( eqns .",
    "( 7.2 ) and ( 7.3 ) ) leads to values of @xmath9 that are consistent , albeit within much larger errors , ( due mainly to the large theoretical error on @xmath16 ) , with the expected value of @xmath97 ( see fig .",
    "the results obtained in this paper for the effective gluon mass in radiative @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays are compared , in table 15 , with some other estimates of the gluon mass that have appeared in the literature over the last 20 years .",
    "apart from the upper limits of yndurin  @xcite , that have been critically discussed in the previous section of this paper , all the estimates lie in the range from 500 mev to 1.5 gev .",
    "the values of @xmath16 obtained here favour somewhat higher values of the genuine gluon masss @xmath66 of @xmath98 1 gev . in particular",
    ", there is good agreement with the estimates of kogan and kovner  @xcite , ( minimisation of the energy of a pure yang - mills qcd wave functional ) , a previous estimate of the present author , using a pqcd analysis of several processes with low physical scales , and the recent lattice gauge estimate of leinweber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite with improved lattice sampling in the far infra - red region .",
    "it is also mentioned in the previous section that the conventional value for the phenomenological scale parameter @xmath65 of pqcd of several hundred mev actually implies a gluon mass some five times larger . since for scales less than @xmath66 , @xmath65 is actually a ( calculable ) scale dependent parameter  @xcite , there is no landau pole in qcd at the scale @xmath99 , but rather a break - down of pqcd at a much larger infra - red cut - off scale @xmath100 gev .    a model of confinement in which a purely imaginary gluon mass is introduced  @xcite predicts the decoupling of physical gluon states at low physical scales .",
    "such behaviour would seem to be inconsistent with the radiative decay data which can only be described by the contribution , in the same infra - red region , of physical gluons with a time - like effective mass .    a contribution in the ope of qcd sum rules corresponding to a tachyonic gluon mass",
    "was recently proposed  @xcite to describe some short distance properties of the qcd potential suggested by lattice studies  @xcite .",
    "this work has no obvious connection with the present one where it is shown instead that a gluon with a time - like effective mass apparently plays an important role in the long - distance region .",
    "since the theoretical uncertainties on the values of the effective gluon mass , @xmath16 , determined here are much larger than the experimental ones ( the former are @xmath101 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath102 ( @xmath5 ) as compared to @xmath103 ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath104 ( @xmath5 ) for the latter ) the most urgent need is for improved theory predictions rather than more precise experimental data than for the @xmath5 .",
    "this is a consequence of the larger size of the gluon mass corrections for the @xmath4 resulting in a greater sensitivity to @xmath16 . ] . as a first step",
    ", nlo pqcd calculations should be repeated including gluon mass effects , as has been done at tree level by parisi and petronzio and liu and wetzel . of even more interest",
    "may be the calculation of : @xmath105 via the exchange of two massive virtual gluons ( actually a nnlo process ) to test the conjectured dominance of this process as already indicated by the structure of the hadronic final state .",
    "as was already evident from previously presented results  @xcite , the usefulness of the nrqcd approach of reference  @xcite will be very limited unless some means is found of incorporating the numerically very important gluon mass effects within the formalism .",
    "another important problem that this approach must address is the possible double counting of pqcd and relativistic corrections  @xcite .",
    "finally it should not be forgotten that the most dramatic effects discussed in this paper ( in the process @xmath0 ) are based on the results of a single experiment  @xcite performed more than 20 years ago now .",
    "it is clearly important that this remarkable experimental result , strongly suggesting that the gluon mass is   @xmath10 gev should be confirmed . in a world",
    "where half dozen or so b - factories ( or their equivalents ) exist , or are under construction , it is high time that the @xmath106 charm - quark energy region be revisited with modern general - purpose detectors and much higher integrated luminosity than that which yielded the data from the mark ii collaboration that has been analysed in this paper . in view of the less than perfect consistency of the different measurements of @xmath1 , an improved measurement of this process , with at least an order of magnitude greater statistics , and reduced systematic errors , would be of great interest .",
    "this is perhaps possible at existing b - factories .",
    "i specially thank m.consoli for a collaboration that is at the inception of the work described in this paper .",
    "i thank s.catani , m.krmer , m.mangano and d.ross for their interesting critical comments .",
    "finally , i am indebted to d.duchesneau for a careful reading of the manuscript , and a discussion that helped to improve the clarity of the presentation .      in the previously published analysis of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 inclusive photon spectra  @xcite",
    ", resolution effects were simulated by smearing the theoretical distributions with a gaussian random number . in order to obtain stable fit results ,",
    "an unsmeared histogram with a very large number of entries was necessary , and the random number throwing had to be repeated at each fit iteration , which was both time consuming and resulted in different statistical errors in the fitted function at each iteration .",
    "even with @xmath107 events in the histogram , the determination of the exact position of the @xmath108 minimum was quite difficult .",
    "to avoid these problems , a new , purely analytical smearing technique was used for the fits presented in this paper .",
    "the method was faster and eliminated all problems related to the statistical errors inherent in monte carlo methods .",
    "a theoretical histogram of the inclusive photon spectrum , with bin index @xmath109 , @xmath110 , is generated with a fine binning , typically @xmath111 .",
    "the corresponding resolution smeared histogram with bin index @xmath112 , @xmath113 , is the generated according to the following algorithm : @xmath114 where @xmath115}{\\sigma[z(j ) ] }   ~~~~~~~~-6 \\le \\delta(j , js ) \\le 6 \\nonumber",
    "\\\\            & = &   0.0~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\delta(j , js ) > 6,~~\\delta(j , js ) < -6   \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath116}\\ ] ] here @xmath117 is the central value of the scaled photon energy in bin @xmath109 and @xmath118 $ ] is the photon energy resolution at energy @xmath119 .",
    "values of @xmath120/e_{\\gamma}$ ] for the different experiments analysed here are reported in table 2 . in this way , a gaussian resolution",
    "smearing of the photon energy by up to @xmath121 around the true value is performed .",
    "precise results were obtained by normalising the unsmeared histogram to a million events : @xmath122 but , unlike in the case of a monte - carlo simulation , the execution time of the program does not depend on this number . the bins of the smeared histogram",
    "are grouped to correspond to those of the experimental histogram before fitting  @xcite .",
    "in all the fits the relative normalisation of the experimental and the smeared theoretical histogram was allowed to float .",
