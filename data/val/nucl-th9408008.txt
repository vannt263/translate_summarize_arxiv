    "the large body of experiments on deep inelastic lepton ",
    "nucleon scattering performed in the 70-th and 80-th , which resulted in the amazing agreement of the data with the quark - parton model and the confirmation of the phenomenon of logarithmic violation of bjorken scaling , provided the basis for the foundation of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the theory of strong interactions .",
    "however , the latest experimental results in this field seem to display deviations from the predictions of the quark - parton model ( `` free qcd '' ) and perturbative qcd .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", it should be stressed that basic theorems ( sum rules ) of qcd require the knowledge of the spin structure function ( ssf ) @xmath1 of the neutron .",
    "this has been recently extracted by deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons off polarized nuclear targets , e.g. deuteron ( spin muon collaboration ( smc )  @xcite ) and @xmath0 ( e142 experiment  @xcite ) and these data , combined with earlier data of the european muon collaboration ( emc ) on the proton  @xcite , are being currently used to check the predictions of qcd  @xcite .",
    "the bjorken sum rule has been computed from e142 data and , using the result @xmath2 obtained by the emc collaboration  @xcite , the value @xmath3  @xcite has been found , to be compared with the theoretical prediction of @xmath4 . at the same time , the smc collaboration estimated for the first time the first moment of ssf of the `` isoscalar '' nucleon : @xmath5 and combining again these data with the emc proton data , for the bjorken sum rule was found to be @xmath6    new experiments are planned at desy@xcite , cern@xcite and slac @xcite , also aimed at an improved measurement of this fundamental prediction of qcd .",
    "it is worth stressing here that , all information on the neutron ssf have been and will be obtained by analyzing dis off polarized _ nuclear _ targets , in particular @xmath7 and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore such an information can in principle depend upon nuclear structure effects , which however are considered to provide only a minor correction .    as a matter of facts , the possibility to measure the near free isoscalar nucleon structure functions by using polarized @xmath7 target",
    "is motivated by the fact that typical nuclear effects in the deuteron are small and are predominantly determined by well - known spin - orbital structure of the deuteron wave function ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . at the same time",
    ", the interest in polarized @xmath0 targets stems from the observation  @xcite that since the dominant component of the @xmath0 wave function is fully symmetric @xmath8 wave with the two protons in a spin singlet state , a polarized @xmath0 can be associated to a large extent with a polarized neutron .",
    "it should however be pointed out that the precision required by a significant check of the bjorken sum rule would demand a quantitative estimate of all possible nuclear effects .",
    "for example , in case of @xmath0 , the @xmath9 and @xmath10wave components of the small realistic three body wave function generate a proton contribution to the @xmath0 polarization and asymmetry , which has to be subtracted in order to obtain information on the neutron properties .",
    "recently , the proton contribution to the process @xmath11 has been quantitatively evaluated by full convolution approach , where not only fermi motion  @xcite but binding as well  @xcite were taken into account by generalizing the usual convolution approach ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by introducing the concept of spin dependent spectral function  @xcite , and nuclear effects have been indeed found to be small .",
    "relativistic light cone calculations have been performed in ref .",
    "@xcite using the spin dependent spectral function of ref .",
    "@xcite ; the obtained results practically do not differ from the non relativistic ones obtained in ref . @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason for the applicability of the convolution model is the existence of two typical momentum scales in deep inelastic processes , which leads to the factorization of the amplitude of the reaction into two pieces , depending respectively on the  large \" external momentum , i.e. the structure function of the nucleon , and the  low \" typical momenta of nucleons in the nucleus , i.e. the momentum distribution of the nucleons  @xcite .",
    "a rigorous method to analyze such a factorization is based upon the wilson operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "a theoretical approach to investigate deep inelastic scattering on nuclei by using the ope method within the effective meson - nucleon theory with one  boson  exchange ( obe ) interaction has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite ; these calculations have been performed within well  defined approximations , such as the leading twist approximation in the ope and the lowest order approximation on the meson ",
    "nucleon coupling constant .",
    "such an approach allows one to derive a convolution formula which includes binding effects and , at the same time , preserves the energy ",
    "conservation sum rule  @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "the model is extended to deep inelastic scattering of polarized leptons off polarized nuclear targets . to this end",
    ", the set of operators , providing the basis for ope , is extended by considering the axial operators in terms of nucleon fields interacting with meson fields . using the non - relativistic reduction , an explicit form of the operators relevant to describe polarized deep inelastic scattering are found .",
    "a particular attention is paid to the investigation of the properties of the physical nucleon , e.g. the physical mass , the meson cloud , the renormalization constants and the ssf s which appear in the calculation .",
    "the explicit expressions for moments of ssf of the lightest nuclei , the deuteron and @xmath0 , are found and the inverse mellin transform reconstructs the corresponding nuclear ssf in the form of convolution of the nucleon ssf and effective distributions of the nucleons in a nucleus .",
    "the obtained formulae are generalized to the case of heavy nuclei and found to be similar to those used in the conventional convolution approach  @xcite . as an example of applications of the method ,",
    "the ssf of the polarized deuteron and @xmath0 are numerically estimated and compared with recent experimental data .",

    "ii the basic formalism is presented .",

    "let us first of all estimate the contribution due to pions ; a direct numerical computation gives @xmath327 ( if model ambiguities given e.g. by different choices for the form - factors and wave functions are considered , one gets @xmath328 ) .",

    "for such a reason dis experiments off polarized @xmath0 are aimed at obtaining information on the neutron ssf s . however , the non vanishing proton contribution to the total polarization and nuclear structure effects could in principle hinder the direct extraction of the neutron ssf .",

    "( [ pgn1 ] ) at @xmath359 .",
    "the smallness of the difference between the free neutron structure function @xmath1 and @xmath320 is due to the smallness of the nuclear structure effects and is largely independent of the form of the chosen parameterization for the nucleon ssf .",

    "@xcite , the results presented in fig . 5 and 6 change by 20% , i.e. by a quantity well below the experimental errors , hence , eq .  ( [ pg52 ] ) may be considered as a good approximation for the extraction of the neutron ssf .",
    "the necessity of plausible and precise data on the neutron spin - dependent structure function is obvious . since the information about the internal neutron structure is predominantly obtained from nuclear data , usually from the polarized deuteron and @xmath0 , an appropriate nuclear model for subtracting of the effects of nuclear structure is requested .    in this paper",
    "a theoretical approach for the analysis of polarized deep inelastic scattering off light nuclei was proposed , which allows a self consistent consideration of the role of the fermi motion and the meson degrees of freedom . since our model relays on the operator product expansion method within obe approximation , the @xmath360th moment of nuclear ssf",

    "the numerical calculations of the spin - dependent structure functions for polarized deuteron and @xmath0 show that the nuclear corrections are relatively small and essentially depend on the spin - orbital structure of the corresponding nucleus , in agreement with the finding of refs .",
    "@xcite , based upon the conventional convolution approach . for the deuteron the main effect of the nuclear structure is due to the destructive role of the orbital motion of nucleons with @xmath361 and is of the order of magnitude @xmath362 .",
    "the comparison with the smc experimental results  @xcite shows a reasonable agreement of our calculations with the data . in case of polarized @xmath0 the main nuclear structure corrections come from the @xmath363 and @xmath10-waves admixtures to the ground state wave function .",
    "since they lead to a partial depolarization of the neutron inside polarized @xmath0 and to an effective proton polarization , @xmath345 slightly differs from the free neutron spin - dependent structure function @xmath364 .",
    "the binding effects in both cases are found to be small .",
    "these results agree with those obtained within the convolution approach@xcite .    to sum up , we can conclude that the convolution approaches so far proposed describe fairly well the peculiarities of polarized dis off polarized nuclei , so that nuclear corrections can be estimated in a reliable way . in closing",
    ", we would like to point out that our method based upon the ope within the effective meson nucleon theory , allows one to microscopically understand the origin of the binding effect which is present in the convolution approach .",
