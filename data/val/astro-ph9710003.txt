    "smail , ivison & blain ( 1997 , hereafter sib ) recently detected a new population of distant galaxies in a deep survey of gravitational lensing clusters in the submillimetre waveband using scuba on the jcmt ( holland et al .",
    "subsequent deeper integration in these fields , and observations of another five cluster fields confirm the results ( smail et al .",
    "1998 ; blain et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the identification of the brightest 850-@xmath2 m source with a dust - shrouded starburst / active galactic nucleus at redshift @xmath3 ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 ) and the non - correspondence of the detected sources with cluster galaxies support these claims . prior to these observations the surface density of faint galaxies in this waveband was uncertain by up to three orders of magnitude ( blain & longair 1993 , 1996 , hereafter bl96 ) , but it is now known to an accuracy of about 50 per cent .",
    "the estimation of the magnitude of confusion noise ( scheuer 1957 ) due to the submillimetre - wave continuum radiation of discrete extragalactic sources has previously required extensive extrapolation from the results of observations of low - redshift galaxies ( longair & sunyaev 1969 ; franceschini et  al .",
    "1989 ; helou & beichman 1990 ; fischer & lange 1993 ; toffolatti et  al . 1995",
    "; gawiser & smoot 1997 ) , and so the uncertainties in the estimates obtained were large as compared with those in the radio and far - infrared wavebands .",
    "our new direct observations allow more reliable estimates to be made .",
    "first , we briefly discuss our observations at 850@xmath2 m .",
    "we introduce a simple parametric model of galaxy evolution , which is similar in form to the _ iras_-based models discussed by bl96 , but fitted to the counts derived by sib , to predict the properties of confusing sources at other millimetre / submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "these models include _ only _ the contribution from dusty extragalactic objects . at the longest and shortest wavelengths in this waveband a significant contribution to confusion",
    "is expected due to other sources of radiation  discrete extragalactic non - thermal radio emission and galactic dust emission respectively .",
    "secondly , we present our estimates of confusion noise as a function of both the angular scale and wavelength of observations . finally , we discuss the relevance of confusion for observations of both distant galaxies and the cmbr using existing and planned millimetre / submillimetre - wave telescopes : the jcmt / scuba ; the airborne stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia : becklin 1997 ) ; the large millimeter telescope ( lmt / gtm ) , a ground - based 50-m single - antenna telescope ( schloerb 1997 ) that will incorporate the bolocam bolometer array receiver ( mauskopf & bock 1997 ) ; large ground - based millimetre / submillimetre - wave interferometer arrays ( mias : brown 1996 ; downes 1996 ) ; the esa _ far - infrared and submillimetre telescope _ ( _ first _ : pilbratt 1997 ) and _ planck surveyor _ ( bersanelli et al . 1996 ) space missions , and balloon - borne instruments , for example boomerang ( lange et al . 1995 ) .",
    "parameters of these instruments and telescopes are listed in table1 .",
    "an advanced - technology 10-m ground - based telescope is also planned for the south pole ( stark et al .",
    "1998 ) .",

    "it is proposed to attach a prototype of the bolocam instrument destined for the lmt to the 10.4-m caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) . unless otherwise stated the sensitivities quoted refer to a 1@xmath0 detection in a 1-h integration including overheads .",

    "1 .   we have estimated the source confusion noise expected in millimetre / submillimetre - wave observations , based on direct observations of distant galaxies at a wavelength of 850@xmath2 m ( sib ) .",
    "although comparable in magnitude to previous estimates of the confusion noise , our predictions are much less dependent on either extrapolations or model - dependent factors . 2 .",
    "reliable limits to the maximum depth of galaxy surveys that can be carried out using either ground - based or space - borne telescopes are imposed by these estimates . for example , a 1@xmath0 sensitivity limit of about 0.4mjy is predicted for the jcmt / scuba at 850@xmath2 m .",
    "this limit could be reached in a fully - sampled map after about 300h of integration in a single field , and so is unlikely to present a problem to planned surveys .",
    "future airborne and space - borne submillimetre - wave telescopes are expected to be confusion limited much more quickly , and so extremely deep millimetre / submillimetre - wave galaxy surveys will require the subarcsecond resolving power of large ground - based interferometer arrays . 3 .",
    "our estimates will be useful for planning and operating future millimetre / submillimetre - wave telescopes .",
    "a _ first _",
    "survey should cover a large area of sky and not involve integrations longer than a few hours in any single - pointed field .",
    "confusion noise arising from distant dusty galaxies will dominate instrumental noise in the planned all - sky survey using the _ planck surveyor _ hfi instrument at frequencies greater than 350ghz .",
    "confusion noise will be more severe in the fields of clusters , reducing the efficiency of _ planck surveyor _ for the detection of the sunyaev ",
