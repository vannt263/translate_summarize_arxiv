    "relativistic heavy ion collisions are an abundant source of strangeness . as strange quarks",
    "have to be newly produced during the hot and dense stage of the collision , they are thought of carrying information on the properties of the matter that was created @xcite .",
    "together with other probes like the elliptic flow and jet quenching , the enhancement of strange particle production is discussed @xcite as a possible signal for the creation of a deconfined phase .",
    "+ although abundantly produced , the strong interactions of strange hadrons are not well understood .",
    "such interactions are not only important for the description of the hadronic phase of a heavy ion collision but also play an important role for the description of dense hadronic matter . in this context hyperon interactions",
    "are key to understand the phase structure of qcd at large densities and the interior of compact stars .",
    "one way to tackle the problem of hyperon interactions is to study the formation of hyperclusters and/or hypernuclei .",
    "hypernuclear physics offers a direct experimental way to study hyperon  nucleon ( @xmath5 ) and hyperon  hyperon ( @xmath6 ) interactions ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the nucleus serves as a laboratory offering the unique opportunity to study basic properties of hyperons and their interactions . even the confirmation or exclusion of the existence for such objects",
    "can be used as an input for models that try to describe hyperonic interactions .",
    "+ more exotic forms of deeply bound objects with strangeness have been proposed @xcite as states of matter , either consisting of baryons or quarks .",
    "the h di - baryon was predicted by jaffe @xcite and later , many more bound di - baryon states with strangeness were proposed using quark potentials @xcite or the skyrme model @xcite .",
    "however , the non - observation of multi - quark bags , e.g. strangelets is still one of the open problems of intermediate and high energy physics .",
    "lattice calculations suggest that the h - dibaryon is a weakly unbound system @xcite , while recent lattice studies report that there could be strange di - baryon systems including @xmath1 s that can be bound @xcite .",
    "because of the size of these clusters lattice studies are usually very demanding on computational resources and have large lattice artifacts , it is not clear if lattice qcd predicts a loosely bound h - dibaryon or if it is unbound @xcite .",
    "an experimental confirmation of such a state would therefore be an enormous advance in the understanding of the hyperon interaction . + for completeness we also include in our analysis a hypothetical n@xmath8 di - baryon with mass 2.054 gev ( see table 1 ) , a weakly bound state of a @xmath8-hyperon and a neutron .",
    "the search for such an exotic object is underway at gsi @xcite .",
    "+ hypernuclei are known to exist and be produced in heavy ion collisions already for a long time @xcite .",
    "the recent discoveries of the first anti - hypertriton @xcite and anti-@xmath9 @xcite ( the largest anti - particle cluster ever reported ) has fueled the interest in the field of hypernuclear physics .",
    "metastable exotic multi - hypernuclear objects ( memos ) as well as purely hyperonic systems of @xmath8 s and @xmath1 s were introduced in @xcite as the hadronic counterparts to multi - strange quark bags @xcite .",
    "+ hypernuclear clusters can be produced and studied in various experimental setups , e.g. from proton or anti - proton induced reactions @xcite as well as pion and kaon beams @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on the production of hypernuclei in high energy collisions of au+au ions @xcite . in such systems strangeness",
    "is produced abundantly and is likely to form clusters of different sizes .",
    "our aim is to determine which processes are most efficient in searching for hypernuclei including exotic ones .",
    "presently , we can discriminate two distinct mechanisms for hypercluster formation in heavy ion collisions .",
    "first , the absorption of hyperons in the spectator fragments of non central heavy ion collisions . in this scenario one is interested in hyperons which propagate with velocities close to the initial velocities of the nuclei , i.e. , in the vicinity of nuclear spectators @xcite .",
    "the hyper - systems obtained here are rather large and moderately excited , decaying into hyperfragments later on @xcite .",
    "alternatively , ( hyper-)nuclear clusters can emerge from the hot and dense fireball region of the reaction . in this scenario",
    "the cluster is formed at , or shortly after , the ( chemical-)freeze out of the system .",
    "a general assumption is , that these clusters are then formed through coalescence of different newly produced hadrons @xcite .",
    "to estimate the production yield we can employ two distinct approaches which allow us to estimate the theoretical uncertainties associated with different treatment of the process . first we use a hadronic transport model to provide us with the phase space information of all hadrons produced in a heavy ion collision .",
    "this information then serves as an input for a coalescence prescription . on the other hand",
    "it has been shown @xcite that thermal models consistently describe the production yields of hadrons ( and nuclei @xcite ) very well .",
    "we can therefore assume thermal production of clusters from a fluid dynamical description to heavy ion collisions .",
    "+ both approaches differ significantly in their assumptions and one would expect to obtain different results , depending on the method used .",
    "hence it has been proposed ( e.g. see @xcite ) that the yield of an exotic hadronic state may depend strongly on its structure .",
    "the purpose of this paper is therefore to , comprehensively , compare hypernuclei and di - baryon production from a coalescence and thermal / hydrodynamical approach , and interpret the differences .",
    "one particular important point is that we deliberately compared two distinctively different models to explore the robustness of our predictions . in this way",
    "we can estimate systematic differences introduced by the two models features , for example a difference in the baryon stopping or hyperon phase space distributions .",
    ".properties of all considered multibaryonic states [ table1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition we point out that the coalescence results depend on the parameters of the model . as mentioned , in the presented results the parameter @xmath10 for @xmath8 s was taken equal to the one of the nucleon s .",
    "however , the hyperon - hyperon and hyperon - nucleon interactions are not very well known and we expect that these parameters may be different for clusters containing @xmath8 s or even @xmath1 s . in table",
    "[ tablecoal ] we demonstrate how the yields of strange dibaryon nuclei depend on the momentum parameter @xmath10 . as discussed previously , we have accordingly restricted the @xmath11 parameter , however , by imposing an empirical limitation related to the nuclear force properties that @xmath11 can not be larger than 4 fm .",
    "one can see , we expect a very large variation of the yields depending on the parameters .",
    "for instance , the probability of a bound @xmath8nucleon state may decrease by many orders , if we assume a small @xmath10 corresponding to a low binding energy of this state .",
    "usually the parameters are fixed by comparison with experiment .",
    "nevertheless , ratios of hypernuclei yields should not be changed in the coalescence model .    ) of most central collisions of pb+pb / au+au as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "shown are only the results from the thermal production in the urqmd hybrid model ( lines with symbols ) .",
    "[ antimidy ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    when the beam energy of the collisions is increased , the system created becomes almost net - baryon free .",
    "this means that the probability to create an anti - particle cluster approaches that of the particle cluster .",
    "figure [ antimidy ] shows the results for anti - particle cluster production at mid - rapidity ( @xmath13 ) in collisions of pb+pb / au+au at center of mass energies of @xmath14 - @xmath15 gev .",
    "we show only results for the urqmd hybrid model because the dcm calculations are restricted to energies up to @xmath16 gev where the statistics needed for a meaningful estimate are quite significant .",
    "the yields of the anti - particle clusters show a monotonous increase with beam energy .",
    "they show that , at the highest rhic energy ( and at the lhc ) the reconstruction of @xmath17 might be a feasible task .      in the following we will discuss the double ratio @xmath18 defined as : @xmath19 for collisions of pb+pb / au+au and a wide range of beam energies .",
    "this ratio is especially interesting , as in thermal production , it does not depend on the chemical potential of the particles ( as fugacities cancel ) , and any canonical correction factors for strangeness are canceled .",
    "it has been proposed that this ratio is sensitive to the local correlation of strangeness and baryon number , therefore being a measure of @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath21    to calculate @xmath4 we use the above obtained yields for hypernuclei and the proton and @xmath8 yields from the same model . for the hadrons",
    "the feed down from resonances is taken into account as well as the feed down to the @xmath22 from the hypertriton .",
    "+ our results for @xmath4 are shown in figure [ rh ] as an excitation function of the beam energy @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath4 is evaluated for the mid rapidity region of most central ( @xmath23 fm ) heavy ion collisions .",
    "the lines depict results from the urqmd - hybrid model and the symbols denote dcm coalescence results .",
    "experimental data are depicted as green symbols with error bars . because experiments usually can not distinguish between @xmath8 s and @xmath24 s",
    ", we show @xmath4 in the cases where the @xmath8 yield includes @xmath24 ( black solid line and squares ) and where the yield is corrected for the @xmath24 ( red dashed line and circles ) .",
    "this is in fact important as there is no experimental indication for a bound @xmath25 hypernucleus .",
    "+ the double ratio @xmath4 from the hybrid model turns out to be almost energy independent .",
    "the same behavior has been observed in previous thermal calculations @xcite . on the other hand , the coalescence result increases with decreasing beam energy and",
    "is in general larger than the thermal result .     as a function of @xmath12 for most central collisions of pb+pb / au+au .",
    "we compare results from the thermal production in the urqmd hybrid model ( lines ) with coalescence results with the dcm model ( symbols ) .",
    "the red line and symbols denote values of @xmath4 where the @xmath8 yield has been corrected for the @xmath24 contribution .",
    "[ rh ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to understand this behavior we plotted the single ratios @xmath26 and @xmath27 from our two approaches ( lines hybrid model and symbols dcm coalescence ) in figure [ special ] .",
    "here it is obvious that even though the dcm calculation produces less @xmath8 s per proton , the hypernuclei to nuclei ratio is still larger .",
    "hence , the @xmath8 is more likely to form a hypernucleus .",
    "there seems to be a stronger correlation in the transport calculation as in the hydrodynamic description .",
    "in fact the qualitative behavior of @xmath4 closely resembles the behavior that is expected for @xmath20 , the baryon - strangeness correlation , for a hadronic gas @xcite .",
    "this observation leads to the conclusion that the information on correlations of baryon number and strangeness is lost in the thermal calculation because here @xmath4 essentially only depends on the temperature . on the other hand , in the microscopic treatment",
    "the correlation information survives and @xmath4 captures the trend of @xmath20 .",
    "( black solid line and circles ) and @xmath27 ( blue dashed line and squares ) from the urqmd hybrid model ( lines ) and dcm model ( symbols ) .",
    "[ special ] , scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have presented results on hyper - nuclei , anti - nuclei and di - baryon production in heavy ion collisions over a wide beam energy range . to explore the theoretical uncertainties we applied two distinct approaches : firstly , the thermal production with the urqmd - hydro hybrid model and secondly , the coalescence calculation within the dubna hadron cascade model .",
    "concerning most hyper - nuclei and di - baryons both approaches agree well in their predictions which gives us confidence in robustness and significance of the obtained results .",
    "we find that both the non - equilibrium and thermal models may be considered as appropriate approaches to describe strange cluster production . in agreement with previous studies",
    "we demonstrate that the most promising energy range to produce hyper - clusters will be provided by the fair and nica facilities , @xmath28 - @xmath29 gev .",
    "anti - matter clusters heavier than @xmath30 are only feasible at rhic and lhc energies",
    ". + the most interesting result of our study is the apparent difference in the double ratio @xmath4 when we compare our thermal results with the coalescence .",
    "this difference indicates that the information on correlations of baryon number and strangeness are visible in the microscopic coalescence approach , while they are washed out in the thermal picture .",
    "this could open the opportunity to directly measure the strangeness - baryon correlation , which may be sensitive to the onset of deconfinement .",
    "the present status of the experimental data does unfortunately not allow for a comprehensive comparison with our model calculations .",
