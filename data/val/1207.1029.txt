    "the portfolio selection problem is one of the most interesting and important topics in investment theory which plays an important role in financial research nowadays .",
    "a huge number of papers are dealing with a mean - variance portfolio and its characteristics ( e.g. , markowitz ( 1952 ) , tobin ( 1958 ) , merton ( 1972 ) , gibbons et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , jobson and korkie ( 1989 ) , white ( 1998 ) , korkie and turtle ( 2002 ) , okhrin and schmid ( 2006 ) , basak et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ) .",
    "currently , the mean - variance analysis derived by markowitz ( 1952 ) is of great importance for both researchers and practitioners on the financial sector ( cf . litterman ( 2003 ) , brandt ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "it is the first systematic treatment of an investor s conflicting objectives , a high return versus a low risk .",
    "the mean - variance analysis is based on a quadratic parametric optimization model for the single - period portfolio selection problem .",
    "an explicit analytical solution is obtained for an investor trying to maximize his expected wealth without exceeding a predetermined risk level and an investor trying to minimize his risk ensuring a predetermined wealth respectively .",
    "alternatively , two other quadratic optimization procedures have been recently considered in literature ( see , e.g. , ingersoll ( 1987 ) , brandt and santa - clara ( 2006 ) , bodnar and schmid ( 2008b , 2009 ) , elikyurt and zekici ( 2007 ) , fu et al . , ( 2010 ) , cesarone et al.,(2011 ) ) .",
    "note that a quadratic optimization problem satisfies the bernoulli principle without imposing the assumption of normality on the distribution of the asset returns ( see tobin ( 1958 ) ) .    in the",
    "following we consider an investor who holds a portfolio consisting of @xmath4 assets .",
    "the @xmath4-dimensional vector of the asset returns is denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the mean vector of @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 , and @xmath9 be its covariance matrix .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is positive definite .",
    "the vector @xmath11 and the vector @xmath12 denote the @xmath4-dimensional vector of portfolio weights and the @xmath4-dimensional vector of ones , respectively .",
    "the first problem considered in the paper is the so - called mean - variance optimization problem suggested in the seminal paper of markowitz ( 1952 ) .",
    "kroll et al .",
    "( 1984 ) showed that the mean - variance optimal portfolio also possesses a maximum expected utility or is very close to this value for utility functions commonly used in financial literature . in the optimization problem of markowitz",
    "an investor is considered who minimizes the portfolio risk for a given level of the expected return .",
    "it is formulated as @xmath13 throughout the paper we refer to ( [ problem1 ] ) as the markowitz mean - variance ( m ) optimization problem .",
    "secondly , we consider an investor who maximizes the mean - variance utility function .",
    "the corresponding optimization procedure , to which we refer as the mean - variance utility ( mvu ) problem , is given by @xmath14 the quantity @xmath15 is the slope parameter of the quadratic utility function . in general",
    "it is not equal to the risk aversion coefficient as defined by pratt ( 1964 ) .",
    "moreover , the quantity @xmath16 determines the risk of the investor under the assumption of a normal distribution .",
    "note that the mean - variance utility function assuming normally distributed asset returns coincides with the exponential ( or cara ) utility function @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the investor s wealth ( see , e.g. , merton ( 1969 ) , elikyurt and zekici ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "the comparison of different utility functions can be found in yu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "the portfolio that maximizes ( [ problem2 ] ) is called the expected utility ( eu ) portfolio .",
    "it has been heavily discussed in financial literature recently ( see , e.g. , ingersoll ( 1987 ) , okhrin and schmid ( 2006 ) , bodnar and schmid ( 2008b , 2009 ) ) . while okhrin and schmid ( 2006 ) obtained the first two moments of the estimated weights of the eu portfolio , bodnar and schmid ( 2008b , 2009 ) derived the sample distributions of its estimated expected return and variance .    finally , our third optimization procedure is , usually , considered in the multi - stage portfolio selection theory ( see , e.g. , brandt and santa - clara ( 2006 ) ) .",
    "it is based on the following quadratic utility function @xmath19 , where @xmath18 denotes the investor s wealth and @xmath20 determines the investor attitude towards risk .",
    "it is formulated as @xmath21 where @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the initial value of the wealth . without loss of generality",
    "we put @xmath26 .",
    "we refer to ( [ problem3 ] ) as the quadratic utility ( qu ) optimization problem .    in table 1",
    "we summarize the optimization problems ( [ problem1])-([problem3 ] ) and present their solutions .",
    "although these three quadratic optimization problems , i.e , the markowitz mean - variance problem ( m ) as well as the problems based on the mean - variance utility function ( mvu ) and the quadratic utility ( qu ) , are intensively discussed in financial theory and financial practice we have not found papers which compare the three considered quadratic optimization problems with each other .",
    "the comparison of different existing models is always meaningful to understand the theory more deeply .",
    "the only papers , where a similar problem has been briefly discussed , are the papers written by li and ng ( 2000 ) and leippold et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . in these papers",
    "it was pointed out that the three quadratic optimization problems are mathematically equivalent but not economically .",
    "although their solutions are lying on the same set in the mean - variance space , we show that they are not obviously the same.@xmath27the solutions of the three considered optimization problems lie on a parabola in the mean - variance space .",
    "however , only using the ( mvu ) optimization problem , the investor always gets a mean - variance efficient portfolio because only in this case all solutions lie on the upper part of the parabola .",
    "this is not the case for the optimization problem ( m ) and ( qu ) since in these cases we can get portfolios from the lower part of the parabola .",
    "nevertheless , they can be made equivalent by adding a corresponding constraint in markowitz s problem as well as in the problem based on the quadratic utility function .",
    "however , the constraints themselves depend on the unknown quantities and , hence , they can not be checked in practice . as a result , the three problems are mathematically equivalent but not from a stochastic point of view . ]     @xmath28&@xmath29    ' '' ''    ' '' ''     + @xmath30&@xmath31    ' '' ''    ' '' ''     + @xmath32&@xmath33    ' '' ''    ' '' ''     +    in this paper these results are extended in several directions .",
    "first , we derive sufficient conditions for the mathematical equivalence which are new and have not been previously discussed in financial literature to the best of our knowledge .",
    "these conditions only depend on the parameters of the asset returns .",
    "the investor only has to change his risk aversion parameter to obtain an equivalent solution for another optimization problem .",
    "second , the influence of parameter uncertainty on the three optimization problems is investigated .",
    "it holds that the parameters of the asset returns , namely the mean vector and the covariance matrix , are usually unknown in practice . as a result",
    ", the sufficient conditions for the equivalence can not be directly verified in practice since they are functions of these two parameters .",
    "the question arises whether the solutions of markowitz s problem and of the quadratic utility problem are always mean - variance efficient . if not then we would like to know how likely are inefficient portfolios obtained . in order to take the parameter uncertainty into account",
    "we replace the parameters in the equivalence conditions by their sample estimators .",
    "we derive the distributions of these estimated quantities assuming that the asset returns are independently and identically normally distributed .",
    "although the assumption of normality is heavily criticized in financial literature , it can be applied in the case of the mean - variance investor ( see tu and zhou ( 2004 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , by the detailed analysis of the probability that the solutions of the optimization problems coincide , we derive a test whether a given solution is mean - variance efficient .",
    "contrary to the classical testing theory for the mean - variance efficiency of a portfolio ( see e.g. gibbons et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , britten - jones ( 1999 ) , bodnar and schmid ( 2009 ) ) , the suggested test on efficiency is constructed under the alternative hypothesis and , consequently , it can be accepted . in order to obtain the finite sample distributions of the estimators and exact tests on the corresponding population quantities ,",
    "the results of bodnar and schmid ( 2008b , 2009 ) are used .",
    "moreover , using real data we show that if these parameters are estimated and replaced by the corresponding estimators then the probability of getting an inefficient portfolio by using markowitz s optimization problem and the optimization problem based on the quadratic utility function can reach @xmath34 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the case with known parameters . in theorem 1",
    "conditions are derived under which the solution of ( [ problem1 ] ) coincides with the solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) and as the solution of ( [ problem3 ] ) is the same as the solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "it appears that these conditions depend on the unknown parameters @xmath6 and @xmath10 . in section 3 the problem of parameter uncertainty",
    "is taken into account .",
    "we replace the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath10 in ( [ problem1])-([problem3 ] ) by their sample estimators . by doing this",
    "we get estimators of the corresponding optimal portfolio weights . in theorem 2",
    ", we derive the probability that the estimated portfolio based on ( [ problem1 ] ) ( as well as the estimated solution based on ( [ problem3 ] ) ) are not mean - variance efficient . in section 3.2 a test theory for the mean - variance efficiency is developed . an empirical illustration is provided in section 4 .",
    "section 5 presents final remarks .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 is given in the appendix ( section 6 ) .",
    "throughout this section we assume that both parameters of the asset return distribution , i.e. @xmath6 and @xmath10 , are known quantities . under this assumption merton ( 1972 )",
    "showed that all solutions of ( [ problem1 ] ) are lying on a parabola in the mean - variance space .",
    "the upper part of this parabola is called the efficient frontier , which is the set of all optimal portfolios .",
    "the parabola is fully defined by the three parameters @xmath35 , which are known as the efficient set constants ( see , e.g. pennacchi ( 2008 ) ) .    using ( [ problem2 ] ) bodnar and schmid ( 2008b ) suggested an equivalent representation of the efficient frontier given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the expected return and the variance of the global minimum variance portfolio ( gmv ) which is the portfolio with the smallest variance .",
    "the quantity @xmath38 denotes the slope coefficient of the parabola .",
    "the set of characteristics @xmath39 is easier tractable than the set of the constants @xmath40 introduced by merton ( 1972 ) .",
    "moreover , bodnar and schmid ( 2008b ) showed that the solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) for @xmath15 coincides with the efficient frontier , i.e. all optimal portfolios obtained by maximizing @xmath41 given @xmath42 are mean - variance efficient .",
    "it is important to note that in general the solution of ( [ problem1 ] ) as well as the solution of ( [ problem3 ] ) do not coincide with the efficient frontier .",
    "they both lie on the parabola in the mean - variance space , but these sets can be larger or smaller than the efficient frontier .",
    "the aim of this section is to provide a comprehensive analysis of this point .",
    "first , we present a short illustration that fully motivates the topic . for this reason ,",
    "we make use of @xmath43 which are considered as the true parameters of the efficient frontier in this example . in figure 1",
    "we plot the solutions of the m problem and of the qu problem for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we observe that the graphs of the solutions of ( [ problem1 ] ) as well as ( [ problem3 ] ) include that of ( [ problem2 ] ) . while the graph of the solutions of ( [ problem2 ] ) is equal to the upper part of the parabola , the efficient frontier , the solutions of ( [ problem1 ] ) and ( [ problem3 ] ) may lie on the lower part , respectively .",
    "it has to be noted that the lower part of the parabola does not consist of optimal portfolios any longer , since for the same value of the variance we are able to specify a portfolio from the upper part of the parabola which has a larger expected return .",
    "moreover , the lower parts of the corresponding solutions are quite large in both cases , especially in the case of the qu optimization procedure .    in theorem 1 we state the conditions under which the optimization problems ( [ problem1 ] ) , ( [ problem2 ] ) , and ( [ problem3 ] ) are equivalent ,",
    "i.e. they all generate a solution that lies on the efficient frontier .",
    "let @xmath7 be a random return vector with mean vector @xmath6 and positive definite covariance matrix @xmath10 .",
    "a.   let @xmath46 be given .",
    "then a solution of ( [ problem1 ] ) is a solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) and it is obtained by choosing @xmath16 equal to @xmath47 if , however , @xmath48 then the solution of ( [ problem1 ] ) does not lie on the efficient frontier and thus it is not a solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) .",
    "b.   let @xmath49 be given .",
    "then a solution of ( [ problem3 ] ) is a solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) and it is obtained by choosing @xmath16 equal to @xmath50 if , however , @xmath51 then the solution of ( [ problem3 ] ) does not lie on the efficient frontier and thus it is not a solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) .",
    "the proof of theorem 1 is given in the appendix .",
    "for @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) the solution is the global minimum variance portfolio .",
    "similar findings are also given in leippold et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who pointed out that the optimization problems are mathematically equivalent but not economically .",
    "however , no condition of the equivalence of ( [ problem1 ] ) , ( [ problem2 ] ) , and ( [ problem3 ] ) is presented in that paper . if @xmath54 is a known quantity then the conditions of mean - variance efficiency in theorem 1a can be directly checked .",
    "however , the quantities @xmath6 and @xmath10 are unknown in practice and have to be replaced by the suitable estimators . in this case",
    "we are unable to guarantee that the solution of ( [ problem1 ] ) or / and ( [ problem3 ] ) lies always on the estimated efficient frontier .",
    "the problem is much more difficult in this case and it will be treated in section 3 .    in the empirical illustration considered in figure 1 , it holds that @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 . for these values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 the corresponding solutions of ( [ problem1 ] ) and ( [ problem3 ] ) are no longer mean - variance optimal portfolios .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the above discussed testing procedures possess several nice interpretation .",
    "they present us an intuition about how large the values of @xmath59 and @xmath61 have to be chosen in order to guarantee investors using ( [ problem1 ] ) and ( [ problem3 ] ) to get an efficient portfolio and , consequently , avoid unexpected losses .",
    "moreover , the importance of these tests seems to increase in the multi - period portfolio context where the above mentioned optimization problems are commonly used and the unexpected loss can be accumulated from one period to another .",
    "thus , for investors using ( [ problem1 ] ) and ( [ problem3 ] ) it is reasonable to correct the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 before constructing the portfolio .",
    "no correction is necessary for investor using the optimization problem ( [ problem2 ] ) .",
    "the assumption of normality and independence of the asset returns is , of course , very restrictive .",
    "however , assuming more complicated distributions or processes it is very difficult to get such expressions as derived in section 3 .",
    "the real asset returns are heavily tailed with a high peak in the center so that the probability of getting an inefficient portfolio can be even larger .",
    "that is why we consider the above mentioned procedure as a benchmark how the probability of mean - variance inefficiency can be determined .",
    "in 1952 g. markowitz suggested a novel approach how a optimal portfolio can be constructed .",
    "the idea of markowitz was to minimize the portfolio variance for a given level of return .",
    "this optimization problem is known in literature as the mean - variance analysis .",
    "recently , other optimization procedures have been suggested ( see , e.g. , ingersoll ( 1987 ) , brandt and santa - clara ( 2006 ) , bodnar and schmid ( 2008b , 2009 ) ) which are based on quadratic utility functions .    in the present paper",
    "we compare three approaches with each other .",
    "it turns out that under some conditions they are mathematically equivalent but not always mean - variance efficient .",
    "it holds that only all optimal portfolios obtained by maximizing the mean - variance utility function are mean - variance efficient .",
    "conditions are derived under which the solutions of the other considered optimizations problems lay on the efficient frontier .",
    "these conditions , however , can not be checked in a practical situation because they all depend on the unknown parameters of the asset returns .",
    "we provide a comprehensive treatment of this problem by deriving the exact expressions of the probabilities that the estimated solutions of the markowitz problem and the one obtained by maximizing the quadratic utility are mean - variance efficient . because the derived probabilities deviate from one",
    "we conclude that the three optimization problems are not stochastically equivalent .",
    "finally , exact tests for the mean - variance efficiency of the obtained solutions are developed .",
    "in this section the proof of theorem 1 is given .",
    "* proof of theorem 1 : *    a.   from merton ( 1972 ) the solution of ( [ problem1 ] ) is given by @xmath62 where the constants @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath54 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are defined at the beginning of section 2 . with some mathematical calculations ,",
    "we get @xmath68 + the last expression is the solution of ( [ problem2 ] ) with @xmath69 ( see , e.g. , bodnar and schmid ( 2008b , p. 1003 ) ) .",
