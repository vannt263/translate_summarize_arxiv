    "the 1996 paper by rozansky and witten @xcite opened up a very interesting new area of geometry and topology .",
    "they wrote down a physical path integral , a sigma model involving integration over the space of all maps from a closed oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath1 into a hyperkhler manifold @xmath2 , which should give rise to a numerical invariant @xmath3 , at least in the case when @xmath4 is compact or asymptotically flat .",
    "we can view this as a construction of a family of invariants @xmath5 of @xmath0-manifolds , or of a family of invariants @xmath6 of hyperkhler manifolds .",
    "part of the appeal of the theory is the marriage of such different worlds .",
    "subsequent work by kontsevich , kapranov , hitchin and sawon @xcite has developed the theory from the geometer s point of view .",
    "in particular , kapranov showed that the hyperkhler condition is unnecessarily strong , and that the theory works for _ holomorphic symplectic manifolds_. this is the point of view we take here .",
    "there are three natural contexts for rozansky - witten theory , each with its own motivations :    _ 1 .",
    "_ perhaps the most concrete application of rozansky - witten theory is to study hyperkhler manifolds .",
    "compact hyperkhler manifolds seem quite rare , though as yet there is no guess at a classification theorem . the rozansky - witten invariants amount to various complicated computations involving the curvature tensor of the manifold , and as such can be related to characteristic numbers . by combining the rozansky - witten invariants with the wheeling theorem of bar - natan , le and thurston @xcite , hitchin and sawon obtained a formula for the @xmath7-norm of the curvature in terms of a topological invariant , which is described in section 9 .",
    "one might hope to extract ( perhaps using the tqft structure ) further identities of this type , and obtain more constraints on the topology of compact hyperkhler manifolds .",
    "a more extensive discussion of the geometrical point of view and its potential applications , together with a list of problems , appears in @xcite ; the present paper will concentrate on the other two viewpoints .",
    "vassiliev theory .",
    "_ a compact holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath8 , together with a holomorphic vector bundle @xmath9 , defines a _ vassiliev weight system _ @xmath10 on the usual algebra @xmath11 of jacobi diagrams with an external circle .",
    "this should be compared with the more familiar construction : a metric ( for example , semisimple ) lie algebra @xmath12 , together with a representation @xmath13 , defines a weight system @xmath14 .    in sections 2 - 4",
    "i will describe the differential - geometric construction of the weight systems , following kapranov . in sections 5 - 8",
    "i describe how simon willerton and i have integrated these two rather different - looking constructions , using the derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath4 .",
    "our original motivation in studying rozansky - witten theory was in fact to try to understand better the algebra @xmath11 and its relatives .",
    "all our intuition about such diagram algebras seems to be derived from the _ invariant theory of lie algebras _ , but as vogel @xcite has shown , there is more to them than that . in rozansky - witten theory ,",
    "diagrams behave more like _",
    "cohomology classes _ , and this seems a valuable alternative point of view .",
    "whether we will gain true insight remains to be seen .",
    "_ 3 . tqft . _",
    "a compact holomorphic symplectic manifold @xmath15 defines a _",
    "@xmath0-dimensional topological quantum field theory _ @xmath16 , a functor from the category of @xmath0-dimensional cobordisms to the category of finite - dimensional complex vector spaces .",
    "again , there is a more familiar example : the _ chern - simons theory _ of witten , reshetikhin and turaev @xcite , in which a semisimple lie algebra @xmath12 and a root of unity @xmath17 define a tqft @xmath18 .",
    "the work of rozansky and witten does not actually give a rigorous construction of such a theory , but justin sawon , simon willerton and i are currently working on providing one : this is described in sections 10 and 11 .",
    "this theory is a really non - trivial new kind of tqft in three dimensions , and exhibits important differences from chern - simons theory , most notably that it is _ not semi - simple _ , and therefore does not satisfy the usual kinds of gluing and splitting axioms .",
    "though many generalisations of the original axioms of tqft have been investigated since their introduction twelve years ago , there were until now no compelling examples to make such study worthwhile .",
    "the tqft also appears to be related to quantum cohomology , quantum @xmath19-theory , and mirror symmetry .",
    "perhaps the techniques of _ @xmath0-dimensional _ tqft will prove useful in these areas , and this theory will finally provide a link between the mysterious world of quantum and vassiliev invariants and the more concrete geometric world of gromov - witten - type invariants , which seems to include almost all the other modern topological invariants .",
    "the _ kontsevich integral _ is an invariant of framed oriented knots in @xmath20 which takes values in ( the completion of ) a certain rational , graded , algebra @xmath11 .",
    "this algebra is defined as the rational span of vertex - oriented trivalent _ jacobi diagrams _ which have a preferred oriented circle , modulo the vertex - antisymmetry and ihx / stu relations .",
    "the relations are like the skein relations in knot theory : they relate diagrams which differ only locally .",
    "the pictures below shows an example jacobi diagram and the three relations . in planar pictures such as these , vertex orientations are taken to be anticlockwise .",
    "we grade diagrams by their total number of vertices ; this is _ twice _ the conventional grading .",
    "@xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24    a _ weight system _ is a linear map @xmath25 , or perhaps to some other finite - dimensional vector space .",
    "such maps enable us to study the structure of @xmath11 , and by composing with the kontsevich integral , to construct more manageable scalar - valued knot invariants , the vassiliev invariants .",
    "this is described by bar - natan @xcite .",
    "the standard examples of weight systems , for a long time believed to be essentially the only examples , are those coming from _ metric lie algebras_. let @xmath26 be a finite - dimensional lie algebra with a non - degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form @xmath27 , and let @xmath13 be a finite - dimensional representation of @xmath26 .",
    "these structures are encoded by linear maps @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "using the metric to identify @xmath31 enables us to transform these into equivalent but more suitable structure tensors : a totally skew version @xmath32 of the bracket ; the casimir @xmath33 ; and the action @xmath34 .    a jacobi diagram of the kind spanning @xmath11 defines a procedure for contracting these tensors together and obtaining simply a rational number .",
    "to do this , associate a copy of @xmath35 with each `` internal '' vertex , a copy of @xmath36 with each `` external '' vertex ( those on the preferred circle ) , and a copy of @xmath37 with each edge of the graph ; now contract the @xmath26@xmath38 and @xmath13@xmath39 pairs throughout .",
    "note that the orientation conventions correspond : we associate skew @xmath0-tensors to skew vertices , and symmetric @xmath40-tensors to unoriented edges .",
    "the jacobi identity and the identity expressing that @xmath13 is a representation of @xmath26 correspond to the ihx and stu relations , showing that this evaluation descends to the algebra @xmath11 and gives a weight system @xmath41 .",
    "an attractive way to introduce rozansky - witten invariants is as a generalisation of the usual chern - weil theory .",
    "suppose @xmath42 is a smooth complex vector bundle on a smooth manifold @xmath4 .",
    "picking any smooth connection on @xmath43 defines a curvature form @xmath44 , from which we seek to produce _ topological _ invariants of @xmath43 , quantities independent of the choice of connection .",
    "it is well - known that the forms @xmath45 are closed , and that varying the connection alters them by coboundaries , so that their de rham cohomology classes in @xmath46 are indeed invariants , namely the components of the chern character of @xmath43 .",
    "the theory of characteristic classes shows that these are the only functions of the curvature one need consider ; in any case , there are no other sensible ways to combine an endomorphism - valued @xmath40-form with itself and end up with a complex - valued differential form on @xmath4 . a schematic picture of the form representing @xmath47 ( in the case @xmath48)is shown below .",
    "each arrow represents a copy of @xmath49 , the blob denoting the `` @xmath40-form - ness '' and the arrow shows that @xmath49 , as a section of an endomorphism bundle has one `` input '' and one `` output '' .",
    "eight disjoint arrows would represent the wedge product @xmath50 ; the circle illustrates the contraction of consecutive inputs and outputs which computes the trace of the product of the endomorphisms .",
    "@xmath51    if we look at a bundle with a structure group other than @xmath52 then there may be more subtle algebraic operations we can use ; in fact , the ring of invariant polynomials on the lie algebra parametrises the different ( complex - valued ) characteristic classes for @xmath53-bundles .",
    "for example , in the case real oriented case with structure group @xmath54 , the ring is generated by the traces of even powers ( corresponding to the pontrjagin classes ) together with the pfaffian , corresponding to the euler class .",
    "the basis of the rozansky - witten refinement ( due , in this form , to kapranov ) occurs when @xmath43 is a _",
    "bundle on a _ complex manifold _ @xmath4 . in this case",
    "there is a preferred class of connections , namely those compatible with the holomorphic structure and with some smooth hermitian metric on @xmath43 .",
    "the curvature form @xmath55 of such a connection lies in @xmath56 , but can also be thought of as an element @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the holomorphic cotangent bundle of @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath59 denote a corresponding curvature form @xmath60 for the _ holomorphic tangent bundle _ @xmath61 .",
    "each of these can be pictured as a _ trivalent vertex _ with two input legs , one output leg , and a vertex carrying the `` @xmath62-form - ness '' ; larger trivalent graphs can then be used to index the ways in which they can be combined tensorially , yielding a richer range of possibilities than in the basic chern - weil case .",
    "@xmath63    in particular , the following three pictures denote elements of @xmath64 obtained by forming the exterior products @xmath65 and then contracting tensorially according to the graph .",
    "the fundamental lemma is that the sum of these three elements is a @xmath66-coboundary .",
    "cohomologically , it will become the jacobi or ihx identity . @xmath67",
    "a similar lemma shows that the element @xmath59 is symmetric in its two inputs , up to a coboundary .",
    "kapranov shows how this identity ( which is really just the bianchi identity on @xmath68 , expanded using the leibniz identity ) , defines the structure of an _",
    "@xmath69-algebra _ on the dolbeault complex of forms with values in @xmath61 .",
    "we will not use this result here , preferring to work at the level of cohomology .",
    "now let @xmath8 be a _",
    "holomorphic symplectic manifold _ , that is a complex manifold of _ real _ dimension @xmath70 , with @xmath71 a holomorphic non - degenerate skew @xmath40-form on @xmath4 .",
    "non - degeneracy of @xmath72 gives a holomorphic identification @xmath73 , and we can use this to convert the curvature form @xmath59 and symplectic form @xmath72 itself into alternative versions @xmath74 the @xmath62-form @xmath75 turns out to be totally symmetric in its three tensor indices .",
    "suppose we take a @xmath76-vertex trivalent graph with a preferred oriented circle . by associating @xmath75 to its internal vertices , @xmath77 to its edges , @xmath78 to its external vertices and wedging / contracting accordingly",
    ", we obtain an element of @xmath79 .",
    "this element is @xmath80-closed , and varying the connections on @xmath81 alters it by a coboundary , giving a well - defined cohomology class .",
    "to avoid a sign ambiguity here we need to orient the edges of the graph ( because @xmath77 is skew ) and order its vertices ( because the vertices carry @xmath62-forms , which anticommute ) .",
    "remarkably , such an orientation of a graph is naturally equivalent to a vertex - orientation of the kind required in defining @xmath11 .",
    "the ihx and stu identities are satisfied because of the bianchi identity , and the result is that we have a weight system @xmath82    if @xmath2 is _ compact _ then we can make a weight system @xmath83 by associating to a graph @xmath84 the integral @xmath85 these numbers are the original rozansky - witten invariants studied by sawon @xcite .",
    "now compact holomorphic symplectic manifolds seem quite rare : khler ones are hyperkhler , by a theorem of yau , and the known examples comprise two infinite families ( the hilbert schemes of points on the @xmath86-torus or @xmath87 surface ) and two exceptional examples due to ogrady ; even non - khler ones are relatively few .",
    "however , the construction of the cohomology - valued @xmath88 described above does _ not _ require @xmath4 to be compact .",
    "although in general we may know little about the target dolbeault cohomology groups , these cases may turn out to be the most interesting for geometers , simply because there are so many examples of ( non - compact ) moduli spaces arising in geometry and physics which are naturally hyperkhler , and therefore holomorphic symplectic .",
    "let @xmath4 be a holomorphic symplectic manifold .",
    "we know that we can construct weight systems @xmath88 out of holomorphic vector bundles @xmath43 on @xmath4 . in order to fit these into the framework of section 5 , we want to view these bundles as _ modules _ over a lie algebra in some category .",
    "ignore the symplectic structure for now and think of @xmath4 simply as a complex manifold .",
    "let @xmath130 be its _ structure sheaf _",
    ", the sheaf of germs of holomorphic functions on @xmath4 .",
    "it is a sheaf of _ rings _ , and the sheaves of germs of sections of vector bundles are examples of sheaves of _ @xmath130-modules _ , in fact _ locally - free _ ones .",
    "if we consider the more general _ coherent sheaves of @xmath130-modules _ , those which are locally quotients of finite - rank locally - free sheaves , then we obtain an _",
    "abelian category_. it is then a natural step to pass to the derived category , which we denote by @xmath131 .",
    "the objects of @xmath131 , then , are bounded chain complexes of coherent sheaves , though thinking of them as complexes of holomorphic vector bundles wo nt do too much harm .",
    "the morphism sets are cohomology groups : in particular , for a pair of sheaves @xmath132 ( viewed as complexes concentrated in degree zero , as described earlier ) we have @xmath133)=\\ext^i(e , f),\\ ] ] a convenient description of the usual sheaf cohomology @xmath124-groups . this language subsumes the earlier differential - geometric language : in fact , when @xmath43 is a holomorphic vector bundle , we can identify the dolbeault cohomology groups , via sheaf cohomology groups , as morphism sets : @xmath134).\\ ] ] notice that @xmath130 is the _ unit object _ in the tensor category @xmath131 , and that the last term in this sequence may be thought of as a kind of `` space of invariants '' of the object @xmath135 $ ] , by analogy with the situation in a module category .    in order to construct a lie algebra in this category",
    "we need a sheaf - theoretic version of the curvature form of a bundle .",
    "suppose @xmath43 is a holomorphic vector bundle on @xmath4 .",
    "its _ atiyah class _ @xmath136 is the extension class ( obstruction to splitting ) arising from the exact sequence @xmath137 where @xmath138 denotes the bundle of @xmath62-jets of sections of @xmath43 .",
    "( see @xcite for the details . )",
    "it corresponds to the cohomology classes of the curvature forms @xmath78 and @xmath55 used in section 3 under the isomorphisms @xmath139    for our purposes it is better to make the identification @xmath140),\\ ] ] because this begins to look like the structural map of a right module .",
    "applying the shift functor @xmath141 $ ] to each side produces a morphism @xmath142 \\ra e.\\ ] ] repeating this for the tangent bundle @xmath61 , with a shift of @xmath143 $ ] gives @xmath144 \\otimes t[-1 ] \\ra t[-1].\\ ] ] this is in fact a lie bracket : it is _ skew _ rather than symmetric , because of the parity shift , and the earlier bianchi identity becomes the jacobi identity .",
    "it is possible to extend the definition of the atiyah class @xmath145 to arbitary coherent sheaves and even complexes of them , so that we have the following theorem .",
    "if @xmath4 is a complex manifold then the object @xmath146 $ ] is a lie algebra in the category @xmath131 , and all other objects in @xmath131 are modules over it .",
    "note that this is true for _ any complex manifold_. so what about the symplectic structure ? by viewing @xmath72",
    "first as as a morphism @xmath147 and then dualising and shifting judiciously , we construct a pair of morphisms @xmath148 \\otimes t[-1 ] \\ra \\oo_x[-2 ] , \\qquad \\omega^{-1 } : \\oo_x \\ra t[-1 ] \\otimes t[-1 ] [ 2].\\ ] ] these are actually _ symmetric _ rather than skew , again as a result of the interaction of the shift with the notion of commutativity .",
    "because these morphisms have non - trivial `` degrees '' , namely the outstanding shifts @xmath149 $ ] , we have to alter the category @xmath131 in order to be able to interpret them correctly as defining a non - degenerate metric .",
    "define the _ graded derived category _",
    "@xmath150 to have the same set of objects as @xmath131 , but with the space of morphisms @xmath151 being the graded vector space @xmath152 , instead of just @xmath153 .",
    "composition of morphisms in @xmath150 is graded bilinear . ) after this `` deformation '' , we can view @xmath72 as a genuine morphism @xmath146 \\otimes t[-1 ] \\ra \\oo_x$ ] , and hence as a metric .",
    "this deformation seems pleasing rather than puzzling if one compares it with the deformation quantization of the category of representations of a semisimple lie algebra arising from the knizhnik - zamolodchikov equation , which is explained further in section 10 . in summary :    if @xmath4 is a holomorphic symplectic manifold then @xmath146 $ ] is a metric lie algebra in the graded derived category @xmath150 , and all other objects are modules over it .    from this theorem and the methods of section 5 we get weight systems @xmath154 for each object @xmath43 of @xmath131 .",
    "what i will now explain is how to bring together the two extremely different constructions of weight systems we have seen .",
    "the basic ingredient is a reformulation of the construction of section 2 in a way that generalises to metric lie algebras _ in categories other than the category of vector spaces_. we will see subsequently that a holomorphic symplectic manifold gives rise to such a category and lie algebra .",
    "suppose @xmath89 is a _",
    "symmetric @xmath90-linear tensor category_. this is a category whose morphism sets are complex vector spaces , and which is equipped with an associative tensor operation @xmath91 , commutative in the sense that there are isomorphisms @xmath92 , for all pairs of objects @xmath93 , satisfying @xmath94 .",
    "the most obvious example other than the usual category of complex vector spaces is the category of _ super_- ( or _ @xmath95-graded _ ) vector spaces , in which the commutativity isomorphism incorporates a sign to make odd elements _ anticommute _ with one another .",
    "it is the fact that this commutativity isomorphism can not be ignored that led vogel and vaintrob @xcite to the picture i am about to describe : for lie superalgebras , the standard construction explained earlier just does nt work .",
    "an object @xmath96 in @xmath89 is a _ lie algebra _ if it is equipped with a morphism @xmath97 satisfying the jacobi identity , interpreted as a linear relation between three morphisms in @xmath98 .",
    "pictorially this is described by @xmath99 where the pictures are read from bottom to top , the trivalent vertex represents the bracket , and the quadrivalent crossing represents the commutativity morphism @xmath100 .",
    "such planar pictures are very useful for describing compositions in a tensor category , and are very common in the tqft literature .",
    "see bakalov and kirillov @xcite , for example .",
    "let @xmath62 be the unit object for the tensor product in @xmath89 .",
    "non - degenerate metric _ on a lie algebra is a pair of morphisms @xmath101 , pictured using a `` cap '' and `` cup '' , which satisfy a certain `` @xmath102-bend '' relation .",
    "left module _ @xmath103 over @xmath96 is an object with a morphism @xmath104 , pictured as a trivalent vertex with a special oriented line marking the legs corresponding to @xmath103 .",
    "a pair @xmath105 determines a weight system @xmath106 to compute it , a diagram in @xmath11 must first be drawn in the plane in a morse position with respect to the vertical coordinate .",
    "slicing it into horizontal bands , each containing a single vertex , cup or cap , defines a way to compose the structural morphisms above , starting and ending at the trivial object @xmath62 .",
    "( an attempt at morsifying the example diagram from section 1 is shown below . )",
    "the result turns out to be independent of the planar picture used ( remember that the diagrams in @xmath11 are simply abstract trivalent graphs ) and satisfies the correct orientation and ihx relations .",
    "the use of derived categories is necessary for the algebraic unification we are proposing , and is even more important for the construction of the tqft .",
    "this section contains a brief description of their structure , concentrating on the fact that _ morphism sets in a derived category are cohomology groups_. because of this , the derived world is the natural place to work if one wants to _ compose _ lots of cohomology classes",
    ". for details , see thomas @xcite and gelfand and manin @xcite .",
    "let @xmath89 be an abelian category , for example the category of modules over some ring @xmath108 .",
    "thus , @xmath89 has direct sums , kernels and cokernels , and it makes sense to consider the category of ( bounded ) chain complexes @xmath109 . the most straightforward notion of equivalence for chain complexes is _ chain homotopy equivalence _ , and it is straightforward to pass to the corresponding homotopy category @xmath110 . but this is not really the correct notion : better is to use the _ quasi - isomorphisms _ , the chain maps which induce isomorphisms on homology , to generate the equivalence .",
    "( whitehead s theorem in topology , that a map between simply - connected cw - complexes inducing isomorphisms on homology is a homotopy - equivalence , is a helpful justification here . )",
    "now homotopy - equivalences are always quasi - isomorphisms , but the converse is not true .",
    "for example , a quasi - isomorphism from a complex of free modules to a complex of torsion modules has no inverse , and this also shows that quasi - isomorphism is nt an equivalence relation .",
    "thus , by _ forcibly _ symmetrising the quasi - isomorphisms in @xmath110 , we obtain a quotient category @xmath111  the derived category of @xmath89 .",
    "it is characterised by the universal property that any functor defined on @xmath109 which takes quasi - isomorphisms to isomorphisms ( the most obvious example being the homology - group functors @xmath112 ) factors through @xmath111 .",
    "the _ objects _ of the derived category are the same as those of @xmath109 .",
    "in particular , objects of the original category @xmath89 may be identified with chain complexes whose only non - zero term lies in degree zero .    under suitable conditions , a _",
    "@xmath113 between abelian categories may also be derived to a functor @xmath114 .",
    "the _ classical derived functors _ associated to @xmath49 are just the composites of the homology functors @xmath115 with @xmath116 . for example , if @xmath89 is the category of @xmath108-modules and @xmath11 the category of abelian groups , then the `` @xmath108-invariant part '' functor @xmath117 has a derived functor denoted @xmath118 , whose classical derived functors @xmath119 are the standard cohomology functors for @xmath108-modules , and are computable using resolutions .",
    "( in classical homological algebra there is an inessential distinction between applying such a functor to an object of @xmath11 , computing e.g. the cohomology of a module , and to an object of @xmath120 , computing e.g. the hypercohomology of a complex of modules . )",

    "the _ poincar - birkhoff - witt theorem _ says that the map @xmath157 , given by including @xmath156 into the tensor algebra @xmath158 and then projecting , is an isomorphism of ( filtered ) vector spaces .",

    "as we have seen , a vector bundle or sheaf @xmath43 on @xmath4 gives a weight system @xmath154 , and therefore a @xmath226-valued vassiliev invariant @xmath227 of framed knots .",

    "equally remarkably , the @xmath223$]-valued invariants coming from lie algebras turn out to be the expansions , on setting @xmath230 , of laurent polynomials in @xmath231 .",
    "is there some analogous hidden structure to the rozansky - witten link invariants ?",
    "the basis of rozansky and witten s work is the path integral which defines the partition function for a closed oriented @xmath0-manifold @xmath103 : @xmath232 the integral is over all smooth maps @xmath233 , and the action @xmath102 is an expression involving a riemannian metric on @xmath103 and the hyperkhler metric on @xmath4 .",
    "it turns out to be independent of the metric on @xmath103 , meaning that the associated quantum field theory , too , is _",
    "topological_. the link invariants described above may also be formulated using the path integral , by insertion of suitable `` wilson loop '' observables .",
    "we would like to have a rigorous construction of this tqft , with which we can calculate and explore .",
    "that is , we would like to build a tqft which shares the predicted properties of the genuine physical theory ; a `` reshetikhin - turaev invariant '' for our `` witten invariant '' .",
    "this is underway in joint work with justin sawon and simon willerton .    to do it we have to work combinatorially .",
    "we will build the tqft by specifying its values on elementary pieces of surfaces and @xmath0-manifolds , calculate for larger manifolds by means of decompositions into such pieces , and prove that our specified elementary data satisfies the coherence relations which ensure that different decompositions of a @xmath0-manifold compute the same invariant .",
    "this is not , in all honesty , a very satisfactory method , but there s little reasonable alternative .",
    "a standard tqft , such as witten s chern - simons theory @xcite , is a functor from the category of @xmath234-dimensional cobordisms to the category of vector spaces .",
    "it is typically a _ tensor functor _ , taking disjoint unions to tensor product ; and a _ unitary _ one , taking surfaces to hermitian vector spaces .",
    "there is a way to enhance such a tqft into an _ extended _ or _",
    "@xmath235-dimensional _ theory , in which we also assign a _ category _ to each closed @xmath62-manifold . in the usual theories this category is _ semisimple _ , with finitely many simple objects , and is promptly replaced by a set of _ colours _ corresponding to these objects . in chern - simons theory ,",
    "the category for a single circle is the ( truncated ) representation category of a quantum group at a root of unity .",
    "its simple objects correspond to the irreps of the classical group which lie inside a certain compact weyl alcove .",
    "the rozansky - witten tqft is somewhat different , and requires a different formalism , which has been studied by freed , segal , tillmann and khovanov @xcite , amongst others . in this formalism",
    "we view a @xmath235-dimensional tqft as a functor from the @xmath40-category of @xmath0-cobordisms with corners , to the @xmath40-category of linear categories .",
    "thus , a @xmath62-manifold is sent to a category ; a `` vertical '' @xmath40-dimensional cobordism between @xmath62-manifolds defines a functor between these categories ; and a `` horizontal '' @xmath0-dimensional cobordism between two surfaces which have common lower and upper @xmath62-manifolds defines a natural transformation of functors . there s no good reason here for imposing a tensor product axiom , unitarity , or semisimplicity of the categories associated to @xmath62-manifolds .    indeed , our theory has none of these .",
    "its basic feature is that a @xmath62-manifold consisting of @xmath236 circles gets sent to the graded derived category @xmath237 : clearly @xmath150 is not semisimple and it is _ not _ true that @xmath238 .    to construct the functor associated to a surface , we break it using morse theory into elementary pieces , and write down the basic functors associated to the different types of handles . for example",
    ", a @xmath40-handle gives the pushforward functor @xmath239 ; a @xmath240-handle , the functor @xmath241 which sends @xmath90 to @xmath130 ; and an index @xmath62-handle which joins two circles , the functor @xmath242 obtained by taking derived tensor product with the structure sheaf of the diagonal , then pushing forward once .    to prove independence of the decomposition we have to use the ribbon structure on @xmath150 , and some extra properties resembling modularity which arise from diagrammatic identities and the kontsevich integral .",
    "these are enough to check that the moore - seiberg equations are satisfied .",
    "to define the invariants for elementary @xmath0-manifolds is more complicated , and uses walker s framework @xcite .",
    "it is possible to recover a traditional @xmath234-dimensional tqft functor which sends surfaces to vector spaces instead of functors from our axioms .",
    "the _ empty _",
    "@xmath62-manifold is sent to @xmath243 , which is essentially the category of graded vector spaces .",
    "a _ closed _ surface defines a functor @xmath244 , which when applied to the generating object @xmath90 in @xmath243 outputs the desired graded vector space .    using the basic data specified above",
    ", we can compute that the graded vector space associated to a closed surface @xmath245 is isomorphic ( non - canonically ) to the cohomology @xmath246 , as postulated by rozansky and witten .",
    "an action of the mapping class group on this space emerges from the moore - seiberg equations .",
    "the superdimensions of these spaces are given for the sphere and torus by the todd genus and euler characteristic of @xmath4 , respectively , and they vanish for @xmath247 .",
    "the space associated to @xmath248 , which is naturally an associative algebra in any tqft , is in fact the ring @xmath226 , which for an irreducible hyperkhler @xmath4 is the truncated polynomial ring @xmath249/(\\bar \\omega^{n+1})$ ] .",
    "it is not semisimple , which shows that the tqft can not be unitary .",
    "this tqft has a close relationship with the le - murakami - ohtsuki invariant @xcite , which is a kind of extension of the kontsevich integral to @xmath0-manifolds , with values in the algebra of trivalent jacobi diagrams . in principle",
    ", the tqft invariant of a closed @xmath0-manifold should equal the lmo invariant , evaluated using a weight system coming from @xmath4 ; the tqft itself should be the evaluation of the universal tqft constructed by murakami and ohtsuki @xcite , which underlies the lmo invariant .",
    "however , their tqft is somewhat badly behaved axiomatically , and there are subtle differences in normalisation which make it unsatisfactory to try to use this approach as a definition .",
    "the @xmath235-dimensional framework seems to work so well when we are building the specific theory associated to @xmath4 that it is better to use it as a foundation , and to make connections with the universal theory in retrospect .",
    "in @xcite we give an extensive discussion of the potential applications of rw invariants to the geometry of hyperkhler ( and certain other types of ) manifolds , and conclude with a problem list .",
    "further discussion of the interaction with vassiliev theory , the theory of quantum invariants and tqft will appear in @xcite .",
    "but it is worth mentioning a few problems here , just to give the flavour of possible future research .",
    "this genus appears in kontsevich s theorem and the hitchin - sawon theorem , as we have seen .",
    "but it also appears in physics , in the context of cohomological @xmath251-brane charge .",
    "it seems natural that these two occurrences are related , but how and why ? ( with impeccable timing , physicists are also now adopting derived categories of coherent sheaves as basic structures in string theory ! )",
    "a straightforward question is whether the root - a - hat genus , like the honest a - hat genus , has interesting integrality properties , and can be interpreted for manifolds with some appropriate geometric structure as the index of a natural elliptic operator .",
    "vogel showed that the primary examples of vassiliev weight systems , those coming from complex semisimple lie algebras and superalgebras , do not span the whole space of weight systems .",
    "but we do not yet know whether the rozansky - witten weight systems lie outside their span or not .    it s easy to prove that the vassiliev invariants coming from lie algebra weight systems are unable to distinguish knots from their reverses .",
    "it is in fact thought likely that _ no _ vassiliev invariants can separate knots from their reverses , and there is an alternative purely diagrammatic statement of this conjecture .",
    "but the proof that lie algebra weight systems fail does nt work for rozansky - witten invariants , so there is still potential here .",
    "these vector spaces , as we have seen , can be constructed from a combinatorial approach to the tqft .",
    "this is a reasonable but crude approach : much better would be to give a direct geometric ( and completely functorial ) construction . in witten s chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath53",
    ", there is an approach via geometric quantization of the moduli space of flat @xmath53-connections on a surface .",
    "is there an analogue in rozansky - witten theory ?",
    "a straightforward guess is that it might be possible to define a virtual structure sheaf of the moduli space of holomorphic maps from a closed riemann surface @xmath245 to @xmath4 , and take its cohomology as the graded vector space .",
    "we would then require a `` projectively flat connection '' , a system of coherent isomorphisms between these sheaves , as the complex structure on @xmath245 varies .",
    "going a level deeper , how does one construct the category @xmath150 functorially from a given circle and manifold @xmath4 ? in the chern - simons case , one uses the representation category of the group of loops from the circle to @xmath53 .",
    "what is the analogue ?",
    "we would require surfaces with boundary to generate functors between such categories by means of a fourier - mukai transform operation .",
