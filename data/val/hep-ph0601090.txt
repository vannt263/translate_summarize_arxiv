    "the dark matter content of the total energy density in the universe is now well - measured , with several experiments determining an abundance of @xmath4 @xcite . so far",
    "the presence of dark matter was deduced only through its gravitational interaction , and thus its identity remains a mystery .    among numerous candidates for dark matter suggested in the literarture , the weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are the most interesting from the point of view of particle physics .",
    "the residual abundance of such particles in the early universe is well understood , with the observed dark matter abundance providing a measure of the wimp couplings through their annihilation cross section at freeze - out ( for a review , see ref . ) .",
    "furthermore the inferred couplings of wimps to the standard model fields are sufficiently large that detection of wimp pair - production via a missing energy signal is possible in current particle physics experiments .    the mass of the wimp can be constrained from above and below using certain theoretical arguments .",
    "the assumptions that the mass scale of the particles that mediate interactions between standard model and wimps is not lighter than the weak scale , and couplings are perturbative produce the wimp annihilation cross sections that vanish both in the limits of very large and very small wimp masses . comparison with @xmath5 , which is required to reduce the dark matter abundance to an acceptable level during freeze - out , produces the allowed mass range , referred to as the lee - weinberg window @xcite . obviously , such a window is very model dependent . in many popular models",
    "this limit requires the wimp mass to be larger than a few gev .",
    "however it is possible to construct simple models in which the required masses can be as low as 100 mev ( e.g. ref ) .",
    "the lee - weinberg limit is usually quoted for fermions , in which case the annihilation cross - section is suppressed by a factor of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the mediator particle , which requires large couplings for light wimps .",
    "however if the cross section is enhanced , or if scalars are used instead of fermions , the lower limit on wimp masses can be significantly reduced .",
    "light dark matter models have several interesting features .",
    "the dedicated dark matter searches , such as dama and cdms , rely on measuring the recoil of nuclei from wimp scattering and as such are less sensitive to wimps which are significantly lighter than the nuclei used .",
    "light wimps produce small recoil energy , which is usually well under the background that peaks at small @xmath8 .",
    "as indicated in figure [ figure : limits ] this insensitivity to sub - gev wimps will not be solved with the next generation of underground experiments , although the cresst experiment is expected to provide an improved probe of dark matter as light as @xmath9 gev ) due to its low recoil threshold .",
    "interestingly enough , there is a possibility that a light wimp could explain the positive signal observed in the annual modulation at dama without violating the bounds from other experiments @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the annihilation of light wimps could explain the galactic positron excess @xcite .",
    "the positron excess has been measured through the flux of @xmath10-rays meassured by the integral / spi experiment @xcite , and seems to require non - standard sources of positrons .",
    "although there are other possible astrophysical explanations ( see for example ref . ) , positron production by annihilations @xcite or decays of light dark matter particles @xcite remains as one of the more attractive solutions due to its natural explanation of the nonlocalized nature of the observed @xmath11-rays .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that the annihilation of light dark matter does not conflict with measurements of either the galactic @xmath11-ray flux @xcite or the extragalactic @xmath11-ray background@xcite , and may also provide an explanation for the observed flux of @xmath11-rays in the 1 - 20 mev range@xcite .",
    "as we recently demonstrated , an intriguing possibility of a sub - gev wimps is the opportunity of detecting a pair of wimps as a missing energy signal in @xmath1 meson decays @xcite . indeed , as dedicated underground searches for dark matter remain largely insensitive to sub - gev wimps , their production is possible in experiments such as  and belle , which produce large numbers of @xmath1-mesons , and can study their rare decay modes . as a result",
    "such facilities provide a new opportunity to search for light dark matter . for the minimal scalar wimp model these experiments",
    "have already excluded most of the parameter space with @xmath12 gev , while future data from @xmath1 factories will be able to probe as high as @xmath13 gev @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the question of how generic the limits on light wimps derived in ref .",
    "are , and whether all dark matter models with sub - gev wimps can be efficiently constrained by @xmath1-physics .",
    "to answer these questions we study the class of models where the interaction between standard model sector and wimps is mediated by one or more higgs particles .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath14 decays with missing energy provide important constraints on the parameter space of such models .",
    "we also point out the possibility , based on the two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) at large @xmath15 , that these constraints can be circumvented .",
    "in section [ msm ] we review our previous results on the minimal scalar model and extend the result for more general scalar models with an additional singlet scalar that mixes with the higgs boson . in section [ 2hdm ]",
    "we apply the same tecniques to a related model with two higgs doublets and calculate the branching ratios of wimp - producing decays of @xmath1-mesons .",
    "this model has the additional benefit of relaxing the fine tuning condition required for a sub - gev scalar wimp in the minimal model . in section [ fermion ]",
    "we introduce some simple models of fermionic dark matter , calculate the wimp production in @xmath1-decays , and discuss the limitations on such models from the lee - weinberg limit .",
    "we also address the case of nmmsm ( next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ) where we show that wimps under 200 mev are generically excluded except special points in the parameter space with @xmath14 transitions being fine - tuned well below its natural scale . in section [ experiment ]",
    "we review the experimental bounds on the decay @xmath16 , and discuss the potential for future searches .",
    "before we present our calculations , we would like to make several important comments . in our discussions of the lee - weinberg limit",
    ", it should be noted that there is no clear division between the perturbative and non - perturbative regions of parameter space and therefore no definitive lower bound on the wimp mass .",
    "however in this paper we will require the wimps to be sufficiently heavy that the abundance constraints satisfy @xmath17 , with @xmath18 representing an effective coupling in each model .    as it is done in ref .",
    ", we treat the significant hadronic uncertainties in the annihilation cross section using the most `` optimistic '' and `` pessimistic '' scenarios .",
    "that results in the certain range for predicted wimp - producing branching ratios . in most of the models we present",
    ", the largest uncertainty exists for a wimp with mass @xmath19 mev that could annihilate through the @xmath20 resonance potentially enhancing the cross section and resulting in weaker couplings .",
    "however , it is unclear whether such resonances exist at the freeze - out temperature of @xmath21 mev ) .",
    "the heavier resonances are not expected to contribute to the annihilation cross section as the higher freeze - out temperatures will significantly reduce the strength of the resonances .",
    "we also will assume that wimps heaver than @xmath22gev will freeze - out before the transition from quarks to hadrons .",
    "we will also limit our discussion to the decay channel @xmath16 . while it is possible to produce wimps in other decays , such as @xmath23 or @xmath24 , the experimental limits on such decays are inferior to @xmath16 .",
    "heavier wimps could be produced in @xmath25 , however a sm decay of @xmath26 is due to strong interactions , which greatly reduces the branching ratio of wimp production compared to weak @xmath1-meson decays .",
    "finally , it should be noted that the collection of models presented in this paper is not exhaustive .",
    "there are other possibilities which could result in light dark matter @xcite , that generically require relatively light particle mediating the interaction between the dark matter sector and the sm sector . in this paper",
    ", we will breifly touch a possibility of a lighter pseudoscalar higgs particle discussed in ref .",
    ", and omit the models with an extra @xmath27 gauge group that have an additional @xmath28 in the sub - gev range .",
    "the latter possibility is interesting , and should such @xmath28 have axial - vector couplings to fermions , one expects large flavour - changing @xmath29 amplitudes induced by radiative corrections .",
    "however , should this new force couple to a pure vector current ( with _ e.g. _ @xmath30 quantum numbers ) , the constriants from flavour - changing decays will be greatly relaxed .",
    "the detailed analysis of models with light wimps supplemented by light @xmath28 goes outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "the simplest wimp model is a singlet scalar@xcite which interacts with the standard model through exchange of the higgs :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the sm higgs field doublet , @xmath33 gev is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) and @xmath34 is the corresponding physical higgs , @xmath35 . the physical mass of the scalar @xmath36 receives contributions from two terms , @xmath37 , and requires significant fine - tuning to provide a sub - gev mass . in this section",
    "we will calculate the branching ratio for the pair production of scalars in the decay @xmath38 , which contributes to br@xmath39 .",
    "being minimal , this model obviously possesses maximum predictivity , and the branching ratio of wimp production can be calculated as a function of dark matter mass only .    it should be noted that the decay @xmath16 is actually expected to occur regardless of the existence or nature of light dark matter . as shown in figure [ diagram : msmgraphs]a and [ diagram : msmgraphs]b , the standard model predicts the transition @xmath40 at one loop , so that the @xmath1-meson can decay to neutrinos @xcite , with br@xmath41 .",
    "however as demonstrated before @xcite , the decay @xmath38 ( resulting from the @xmath14 transition shown in figure [ diagram : msmgraphs]c ) can enhance the missing energy signal by up to two orders of magnitude .",
    "the transition @xmath42 occurs as a loop process , which at low momentum transfer can be calculated by differentiation of the @xmath0 self - energy operator with respect to @xmath43 ,    @xmath44    as the higgs is significantly heavier than the other particles involved in the process , it can be integrated out leaving an effective lagrangian for the @xmath0 transitions with missing energy :    @xmath45    leading order wilson coefficients for the transitions with dark matter scalars or neutrinos in the final state are given by @xmath46 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 . from this effective theory and the hadronic form factors calculated in the light - cone sum rules @xcite , the partial width for decays with missing energy can be calculated    @xmath48    where we use the parametrization @xmath49    and the available phase space as a function of the unknown @xmath50 , @xmath51^{-1},\\ ] ] with @xmath52^{\\frac{1}{2 } } [ 1 - 4m_s^2/\\hat s]^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ]    [ figure : branchratio ]    @xmath53    \\(a ) constraints on @xmath54 from dark matter abundance .",

    "parameter space above curves i , ii and iii is excluded .",
    "the grey bar shows the expected @xmath57 signal .",
    "parameter space to the left of the vertical dashed line can also be probed with @xmath58 .    for comparison",
    ",  recently reported@xcite a limit of br@xmath59 at @xmath60 c.l . which is well above the sm prediction .",
    "belle s preliminary results were reported at br@xmath61 level @xcite .",
    "similar calculations can be used for the decay @xmath62 ,    @xmath63    with an analogous form factor .",
    "even before we perform the freeze - out abundance calculation and extract @xmath54 , it is obvious that the decay into wimps would dominate the standard model rate to neutrinos by one - to - two orders of magnitude near the lee - weinberg bound of @xmath64 . to make this statement more precise , we extract the parameter @xmath54 using the relation of the wimp annihilation cross section ,    @xmath65    with the observed dark matter abundance @xcite , @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the total decay width for a virtual higgs of mass @xmath68 , and in our calculation we utilize the zero temperature decay widths which were studied previously in early searches for a light higgs @xcite as explained in our previous paper @xcite .",
    "the allowed range of @xmath54 is plotted in figure [ figure : branchratio]a , where the main uncertainty comes from @xmath69 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that the domain of @xmath54 s _ below _ curve b gives an over - production of dark matter and therefore is firmly excluded .",
    "inserting @xmath70 domain allowed by the relic abundance into the result for the branching ratio gives the prediction of br@xmath71 as a function of @xmath50 , figure [ figure : branchratio]b .",
    "these results can be easily generalized to models of scalar dark matter coupled to the sm via an additional singlet higgs particle @xmath72 .",
    "the simplest model of this type has the potential    @xmath73    where in the second line we retained only mass terms and relevant interaction terms .",
    "@xmath74 denotes the excitation around the vev of @xmath72 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 stand for dimensionful parameters presumably of order the electroweak scale .",
    "the last term in the second line of ( [ tsdm ] ) gives the mixing between scalars @xmath74 and @xmath34 .",
    "if such mixing is significant , the existing bounds on the higgs mass would also place a lower bound on the mass of the @xmath74-boson .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath77 transitions is the same as eq .",
    "[ bse ] , with the wilson coefficient given by    @xmath78    which , with the redefinition    @xmath79    results in the same abundance constraints and the same branching ratio for @xmath80 , as plotted in figure [ figure : branchratio ] .",
    "thus , we see that the model with more parameters in the singlet sector ( [ tsdm ] ) in the limit of light wimps gives identical predictions to the minimal model ( [ lagr ] ) , and in this sense the predictions of figure [ figure : branchratio]b are generic .",
    "the singlet scalar model of wimps coupled to the sm is the most economical model of dark matter , and for sub - gev wimps can be well constrained with existing @xmath1-factory experiments",
    ". however , the light masses of wimps in this model are not natural , as it requires significant fine - tuned cancelation between @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "however , if the electroweak sector of the sm is modified , this fine - tuning can be significantly relaxed .    in this section ,",
    "we consider a singlet scalar wimp which interacts with two higgs doublets , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "@xmath85    we assume the most conservative flavour arrangement in which the up- and down - types of quarks originated from the expectation values of different higgses , exactly as it happens in supersymmetric models ( see _ e.g. _ ref . ) .",
    "this model differs from the sm in a significant way : due to two different vev s of the two higgs doublets , there is an additional parameter @xmath86 , which is large when yukawa couplings in the down - sector are enhanced .",
    "indeed , there are many theories which attempt to unify the yukawa couplings of the third generation of the standard model ( eg see ref . ) .",
    "such unification typically requires @xmath87 or @xmath88 and thus @xmath89(few gev ) .",
    "therefore in the regime of large @xmath15 the mass corrections which depend only on @xmath90 will in general be small and may lead to minimal fine tuning .",
    "for example , the physical mass of the wimp scalar in the model given above is    @xmath91    if @xmath92 , sub - gev wimps would require the same amount of fine tuning as before .",
    "however in the special case of large @xmath15 and the hierarchy of @xmath93 s , @xmath94 the mass correction depends only on @xmath90 , resulting in @xmath95 for a gev - scale wimp mass , which then does not require significant fine tuning . in the case of @xmath96",
    ", the fine - tuning is also relaxed , especially if the abundance constraint allows for @xmath97 . in the rest of this section",
    ", we analyze the wimp production in the model , assuming large @xmath15 .",
    "the additional diagrams which contribute to the decay @xmath38 and give the leading - order contributions in @xmath15 are given in figure [ figure:2hdmdiagrams ] .",
    "the effective lagrangian is of the same form as eq [ bse ] , and in the limit of large @xmath99 and @xmath100 the wilson coefficient is    @xmath101    where @xmath102 .",
    "the branching ratio is calculated as before ,    @xmath103    here we use the parameterization ,    @xmath104    and unlike the minimal case there is an additional rather mild dependence on @xmath105 through @xmath106 .",
    "it disappears in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "we also make a safe assumption that additional diagrams with charged higgses are not going to alter the branching to neutrinos .",
    "as before , @xmath108 is constructed such that @xmath109^{-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for @xmath112 .",
    "the branching ratio is plotted in figure [ 2hdm : br1]b with the current experimental bounds from  @xcite , belle @xcite and cleo @xcite .",
    "@xmath113    the abundance constraint on @xmath54 is calculated as in section [ msm ] , with one important difference .",
    "when @xmath15 is large , the scalars predominantly couple to leptons and down - type quarks .",
    "consequently , the charm and top loops do not contribute in the effective couplings to gluons , leading to the reduction in the cross - sections for @xmath114 by a factor of @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the number of heavy quark flavors that convert virtual higgs to hadrons .",
    "@xmath117 in the minimal model , and @xmath118 in the 2hdm with large @xmath15 .",
    "the charm threshold also does not offer additional annihilation channels . as a result , the values of @xmath98 that would fit the observed abundance of dark matter are higher than the corresponding values for @xmath93 in the minimal scalar model studied previously .",
    "the resulting @xmath54 , figure [ 2hdm : br1]a , clearly corresponds to a strong interaction regime below wimp masses of 500 mev .",
    "the case in which the scalars couple predominantly to @xmath83 produces results similar to the minimal model of section [ msm ] . in the large @xmath99 limit @xmath120 and therefore the fine - tuning of the scalar mass is significant , while the branching ratio for @xmath38 and constraints on @xmath119 are not expected to be significantly different from the minimal model with one higgs doublet .",
    "the third possibility is that the dark matter scalars couple to the @xmath122 combination of the two higgs fields . in this case",
    "the mass of the scalar is    @xmath123    which in the large @xmath99 limit requires less fine - tuning to produce sub - gev wimps than in the minimal scalar model .",
    "we find that in this model the branching ratio of wimp pair production in @xmath1-meson decays is suppressed .",
    "it turns out that two @xmath124 diagrams that have @xmath99 enhancement shown in figure [ figure : l3diagrams ] exactly cancel each other so that @xmath125 .    at the same time , the abundance constraint is similiar to the @xmath98 dominant case , except that the scalar annihilation cross - section is enhanced by a factor of @xmath126 , resulting in @xmath121 being @xmath15 times smaller than @xmath98 from the previous example . a combination of the enhanced annihilation cross section and cancellation of @xmath127 amplitude at leading order in @xmath99 , results in @xmath128 suppression of @xmath127 branching ratio relative to previous examples .",
    "consequently ,    @xmath129    and therefore this model can not be constrained by @xmath1-decays .",
    "it is then clear that a generic case with both couplings , @xmath98 and @xmath121 , being important can create a large range for @xmath130 even for a fixed value of @xmath50 , and therefore the model of scalar dark matter coupled to 2hdm is far less predictive than the minimal model .",
    "it also interesting to note that the elastic scattering of dark matter on nucleons is enhanced by @xmath131 when @xmath121 is dominant , and therefore this model will indeed create a measurable signal for detectors with low recoil energy threshold such as cresst .",
    "detailed analysis of such constraints goes outside the scope of the present paper .",
    "in the previous two sections the wimps were presumed to be scalar fields .",
    "this is common in models of light dark matter , as the lee - weinberg limit on the wimp mass is in general lower for scalar wimps .",
    "however fermionic dark matter could still be light if its annihilation cross section is enhanced . in this section",
    "we will present some simple models of fermionic dark matter , and review the constraints from @xmath1-decays .",
    "the simplest renormalizable model of fermionic dark matter is the analogue of the scalar model given in eq [ tsdm ] ,    @xmath132    where @xmath133 is a majorana fermion and @xmath32 is the standard model higgs field . as before , @xmath134 .",

    "the second model we will consider is the analogue of the model presented in section [ 2hdm ] . for the model to be renormalizable , the majorana fermions can not couple directly to the higgs fields , but must instead couple through an intermediate scalar .",
    "@xmath139    as in the previous model , the inclusion of fermions in this model requires an increase in the coupling constants by a factor of @xmath140 , with @xmath141 , to produce the same abundance of dark matter .",
    "however in the special case of @xmath142 the annihilation cross section is also enhanced by a factor of @xmath126 , and so @xmath133 could be light without requiring large @xmath121 .",
    "the abundance constraints are given in figure [ figure:2hdmchi ] , with    @xmath143    as in the @xmath121 dominant case presented in section [ 2hdm ] , the @xmath144 contributions ( see figure [ diagrams : fermion2 ] ) to the process @xmath145 cancel and as a result @xmath146    the final model we will consider is a majorana fermion @xmath133 coupled to higgs - higgsino pairs . by `` higgsinos '' we mean an @xmath147 charged fermionic fields with the same quantum numbers as the higgs fields but do not impose supersymmetry requirements on the size of the couplings . by the same token @xmath133 can be called the neutralino .",

    "we express the @xmath1-decay misisng energy signal as @xmath190 with @xmath191^{-1}.\\ ] ]    using the freeze - out abundance to constrain @xmath54 ,    @xmath192    and imposing the experimental bound of br@xmath193 on the branching ration , we arrive at the following constraint on @xmath180 , @xmath194 this is a requirement on @xmath180 to be suppressed relative to its natural value by three orders of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that unless an unnatural cancellation of @xmath180 occurs , the possibility of a @xmath195 mev neutralinos in nmssm is excluded",
    ". however , even if the susy contribution vanishes for some reasons , the next - to - leading order in @xmath15 contribution mediated by charged higgs loops is still capable of producing an observable signal , which from existing bounds still excludes a @xmath195 mev neutralino .",
    "the decays of the type @xmath196 discussed here involve missing energy but provide no constraint on the associated missing mass .",
    "this is problematic experimentally , even for a hypothetical detector with full solid angle coverage , unless one of the two @xmath1 mesons in the event is fully reconstructed .",
    "similarly , it is hard to imagine that a sensitive search can be done without the well - constrainted initial state provided by experiments at the threshold for @xmath197 production .",
    "this discussion will therefore focus on experiments at the @xmath198 .",
    "the @xmath1 reconstruction can be done using either hadronic or semileptonic decays .",
    "after the decay products of one @xmath1 are removed from consideration , signal events should contain only a single kaon while background events will generally contain additional charged or neutral particles . in reality ,",
    "beam - related backgrounds tend to leave additional energy in the electromagnetic calorimeter and interactions of particles from the fully reconstructed @xmath1 with material in the detector can lead to additional , spurious charged or neutral particles .",
    "the selection criteria balance the loss of efficiency from strict vetoes on additional activity against the suppression of background . after removing particles associated with the fully reconstructed @xmath1 ,",
    "no charged tracks are allowed beyond the identified kaon , and the neutral electromagnetic energy deposition is restricted to be less than 200 - 300  mev .",
    "the background is negligible for @xmath2 energies near @xmath199 and rises steadily toward lower @xmath2 momenta . as a result ,",
    "the experiments place a requirement on the minimum accepted @xmath2 momentum ; this is further discussed below .",
    "the cleo measurement reconstructs @xmath1 mesons in hadronic decays and requires @xmath200  gev , providing sensitivity to dark matter particle masses up to 2.1  gev and placing a limit of br@xmath201 for the sm decay .",
    "the  and belle measurements each require @xmath202  gev , thereby restricting sensitivity to dark matter particle masses below 1.9  gev",
    ".  reconstructs @xmath1 mesons in both hadronic and semileptonic modes with comparable sensitivity in each , and determines br@xmath203 based on a sample of @xmath204 @xmath205 decays .",
    "belle uses only events with one @xmath1 reconstructed in a hadronic decay mode and find the preliminary result br@xmath206 based on a sample of @xmath207 @xmath205 decays .",
    "the expected background from normal @xmath1 decays with two or more missing particles is several times higher than the signal expected from the sm process with neutrino pair .",
    "this background has contributions from semileptonic decays ( e.g. @xmath208 with @xmath209 or @xmath210 ) where the the detectable particles other than the @xmath211 lie outside the detector acceptance , as well as from hadronic @xmath1 decays involving one or more @xmath212 , which have a non - negligible probability of traversing the electromagnetic calorimeter without depositing significant energy .",
    "the latter decays in some cases still have poorly known branching ratios , but these can be measured ( or more stringently bounded ) with larger @xmath1-factory data sets .",
    "the sensitivity can be expected to improve as @xmath213 as more data are analyzed .",
    "the decay @xmath214 does nt add much sensitivity due to the smaller reconstruction efficiency for both the @xmath215 ( about 1/2 that of @xmath216 ) and the @xmath217 ( only 1/3 decay to @xmath218 ) .",
    "the decays @xmath219 have sensitivity comparable to @xmath196 ( the branching ratios for both the sm and new physics transitions are higher due to the higher probability of producing a @xmath3 in the fragmentation of the @xmath220 quark , offsetting the lower experimental efficiency ) .",
    "the @xmath221 channel should be sensitive to dark matter masses only slightly smaller than those explored in the @xmath196 channel , allowing for an improvement in overall sensitivity to light dark matter .",
    "this , coupled with the @xmath222  ab@xmath223 data samples that will soon be available from the @xmath1 factories , should push the sensitivity to missing energy processes to @xmath224 times the level of the sm branching ratio .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that @xmath1-decays with missing energy provide a viable method for exploring light dark matter models .",
    "this alternative to dedicated underground experiments has considerable sensitivity to light wimps , and can probe dark matter using existing experimental results .",
    "while this result has been previously demonstrated in ref , this paper extends the result to include several different models .",
    "in particular it has been demonstrated that the 2hdm+scalar model , in the case of @xmath98 dominant , can satisfy the abundance constraint with br@xmath225 .",
    "this model has an additional benefit , as it requires only minimal fine tuning to achieve sub - gev wimps in the large tan @xmath226 limit .",
    "data from  and belle excludes the parameter space below @xmath227gev , while future measurements are expected to probe up to @xmath228gev .",
    "the case of @xmath121 dominant also provides sub - gev wimps with minimal fine - tuning .",
    "however in that case the branching ratio br@xmath229 is suppressed by factor of @xmath126 relative to the @xmath98 dominant case , and therefore is significantly smaller than the standard model signal . in this case , only the direct searches with the low recoil energy threshold has a chance of detecting these wimps .",
    "furthermore we have demonstrated that it is possible to search for fermionic dark matter in @xmath1-decays , though in the models presented the couplings are required to be non - perturbative to meet the abundance constraint for @xmath230 gev .",
    "while it is possible that heavier fermions could be produced in @xmath1-decays , the branching ratio for such a process is significantly smaller than the standard model predictions .",
    "it is also possible to lower the lee - weinberg limit in these models by allowing other light particles which are very weakly coupled to the standard model , such as in the nmssm with one light pseudoscalar higgs . in such a model",
    ", it would be possible to have weak couplings and still produce an observable increase in br@xmath231 .",
    "our analysis shows that indeed @xmath232 mev neutralinos of nmssm are generically excluded by the @xmath1 decay data , while heavier ( above 1 gev ) neutralinos would probably be compatible with existing constraints .    except for the case of nmssm ,",
    "we have limited the discussion to models which do not include new forces below the electroweak scale .",
    "models with new resonances below @xmath167 can be explored using @xmath1-decays , but in addition they might be well constrained by existing experiments and therefore should be introduced with caution .",
    "such models can be analyzed in exactly the same manner as presented in this paper .",
