    "let @xmath0 be a field of characteristic zero .",
    "based on the construction of the motivic algebraic cobordism spectrum @xmath4 by voevodsky , levine and morel @xcite gave a geometric construction of the algebraic cobordism and showed that this is a universal oriented borel - moore homology theory in the category of varieties over the field @xmath0 .",
    "their definition was extended by deshpande @xcite in the equivariant set - up that led to the notion of the equivariant cobordism of smooth varieties acted upon by linear algebraic groups .",
    "this in particular allowed one to define the algebraic cobordism of the classifying spaces analogous to their complex cobordism .",
    "apart from its many applications in the equivariant set up which are parallel to the ones in the non - equivariant world , an equivariant cohomology theory often leads to the description of the corresponding non - equivariant cohomology by mixing the geometry of the variety with the representation theory of the underlying groups .    our aim in this first part of a series of papers is to develop the theory of equivariant cobordism in the category of all @xmath0-schemes with action of a linear algebraic group .",
    "we establish the fundamental properties of this theory and give applications . in the second part",
    "@xcite of this series , we shall give other important applications of the results of this paper .",
    "some further applications of the results of this paper to the computation of the non - equivariant cobordism rings appear in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now describe some of the main results in of this paper .",
    "let @xmath1 be a linear algebraic group over @xmath0 . in this paper , a scheme will mean a quasi - projective @xmath0-scheme and all @xmath1-actions will be assumed to be linear . if @xmath2 is a smooth scheme with a @xmath1-action , deshpande defined the equivariant cobordism @xmath5 using the coniveau filtration on the levine - morel cobordism of certain smooth mixed spaces .",
    "this was based on the construction of the chow groups of classifying spaces in @xcite and the equivariant chow groups in @xcite .    using a _ niveau _ filtration on the algebraic cobordism , which is based on the analogous filtration on any borel - moore homology theory as described in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  3 ) , we define the equivariant algebraic cobordism of any @xmath0-scheme with @xmath1-action in section  [ section : ec ] .",
    "this is defined by taking a projective limit over the quotients of the levine - morel cobordism of certain mixed spaces by various levels of the niveau filtration . in order to make sense of this construction",
    ", one needs to prove various properties of the above niveau filtration which is done in section  [ section : niv ] .",
    "these equivariant cobordism groups coincide with the one in @xcite for smooth schemes .",
    "we also show in section  5 how one can recover the formula for the cobordism group of certain classifying spaces directly from the above definition , by choosing suitable models for the underlying mixed spaces",
    ".    the first main result on these equivariant cobordism groups is to show that they satisfy the localization exact sequence , a fundamental property of any cohomology theory . for smooth schemes ,",
    "a version of the localization sequence was proven in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  7.3 ) . however , the proof given there is not complete ( _ cf . _ remark  [ remk : incomplete ] ) .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that the projective limit is not in general a right exact functor . hence to prove the equivariant version of the localization sequence",
    ", one needs a stronger version of the levine - morel localization sequence involving the above niveau filtration . we prove this refined localization sequence in theorem  [ thm : rls ] which is then used to give the complete proof of the equivariant localization sequence in theorem  [ thm : els ] .",
    "we prove the other expected properties such as functoriality , homotopy invariance , exterior product , projection formula and existence of chern classes for equivariant vector bundles in theorem  [ thm : basic ] .    in section  7",
    ", we show how the equivariant cobordism is related to other equivariant cohomology theories such as equivariant chow groups , equivariant @xmath3-groups and equivariant complex cobordism . using some properties of the niveau filtration and known relation between the non - equivariant cobordism and chow groups ,",
    "we deduce an explicit formula ( _ cf . _ proposition  [ prop : cbch ] ) which relates the equivariant cobordism and the equivariant chow groups of @xmath0-varieties . using this and the main results of @xcite",
    ", we give a formula in theorem  [ thm : cktheory ] which relates the equivariant cobordism with the equivariant @xmath3-theory of smooth schemes .",
    "we also construct a natural transformation from the algebraic to the equivariant version the complex cobordism for varieties over the field of complex numbers .",
    "our next main result of this paper is theorem  [ thm : w - inv ] , where we show that for a connected linear algebraic group @xmath1 acting on a scheme @xmath2 , there is a canonical isomorphism @xmath6 with rational coefficients , where @xmath7 is a split maximal torus of a levi subgroup of @xmath1 with weyl group @xmath8 .",
    "this is mainly achieved by the morita isomorphism of proposition  [ prop : morita ] and a detour to the motivic cobordism @xmath4 and its extension @xmath9 to singular schemes by levine @xcite .",
    "this motivic cobordism @xmath9 comes into play due to the advantage that it is a bigraded borel - moore homology which has long exact localization sequences .",
    "what helps us in using this theory in our context is the recent comparison result of levine @xcite which shows that the levine - morel cobordism theory is a piece of the more general @xmath9-theory .    as an easy consequence of proposition  [ prop : cbch ] ,",
    "we recover totaro s cycle class map ( _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite ) @xmath10 for a complex linear algebraic group @xmath1 .",
    "it is conjectured that this map is an isomorphism of rings .",
    "this conjecture has been shown to be true by totaro for some classical groups such as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "although , we can not say anything about this conjecture here , we do show as a consequence of theorem  [ thm : w - inv ] that the map @xmath15 is indeed an isomorphism of rings with the rational coefficients ( see theorem  [ thm : acc * ] for the full statement ) .",
    "we do this by first showing that there is a natural ring homomorphism @xmath16 ( with integer coefficients ) which lifts totaro s map .",
    "we then show that this map is in fact an isomorphism with rational coefficients using theorem  [ thm : w - inv ] .    as some more applications of theorem  [ thm : w - inv ]",
    ", we aim to compute the cobordism ring of certain spherical varieties in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we briefly recall the definition of algebraic cobordism of levine - morel . we also recall the other definition of this object as given by levine - pandharipande .",
    "since we shall be concerned with the study of schemes with group actions and the associated quotient schemes , and since such quotients often require the original scheme to be quasi - projective , we shall assume throughout this paper that all schemes over @xmath0 are quasi - projective .",

    "this assumption is always satisfied for normal schemes ( _ cf . _",
    "* theorem  2.5 ) , @xcite ) .",
    "before we define the algebraic cobordism , we recall the lazard ring @xmath21 .",
    "it is a polynomial ring over @xmath22 on infinite but countably many variables and is given by the quotient of the polynomial ring @xmath23 $ ] by the relations , which uniquely define the universal formal group law @xmath24 of rank one on @xmath21 .",
    "this formal group law is given by the power series @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the equivalence class of @xmath27 in the ring @xmath21 .",
