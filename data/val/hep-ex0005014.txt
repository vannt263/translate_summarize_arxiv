    "the deficit of neutrinos coming from the sun , known as the solar neutrino problem , has long been established by past experiments@xcite .",
    "a global analysis of these experimental results suggests an energy dependent suppression in the flux of solar neutrinos@xcite .",
    "this suppression , via neutrino oscillations@xcite , could produce spectral distortions in the measured solar neutrino spectrum .",
    "super - kamiokande is the first experiment in a new generation of neutrino observatories that set out to measure the spectrum of neutrinos from the sun@xcite .",
    "super - kamiokande ( sk ) , a water cherenkov detector , is sensitive only to the high energy and rare hep neutrinos from the sun .",
    "detection of lower energy neutrinos is impeded by the high energy threshold of a water detector .",
    "the recoil electrons resulting from the elastic scatter of these neutrinos are observed in sk , providing energy and directional information in real time . since the angular resolution of the detector for electrons of these energies is limited by multiple coulomb scattering , performing a kinematic reconstruction of the incident neutrino energy is precluded .",
    "the measured electron energy is a lower limit of the neutrino energy and the shape of the solar neutrino energy spectrum must be inferred from the measured recoil electron spectrum .",
    "this situation increases the sensitivity to errors in the absolute energy scale when making solar neutrino flux and spectrum measurements . to set the energy scale , an electron linear accelerator ( linac ) was installed at sk to inject electrons of known energies into the detector@xcite . in order to cross check this calibration ,",
    "the decay of is used .",
    "first , a portable neutron generator has been employed to obtain high statistics data samples of at many positions in the detector to accurately check the absolute energy scale .",
    "second , the rate of from the capture of stopped @xmath0 is measured as a check of the solar neutrino analysis tools .",
    "super - kamiokande is a water cherenkov detector located in the kamioka mine in gifu , japan .",
    "the walls of the cylindrical detector are constructed from welded stainless steel plates , backed with concrete .",
    "the detector is divided into an inner and and outer detector ( i d and od respectively ) by a stainless steel frame structure that serves as an optical barrier and a mounting point for all photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "cherenkov light in the i d is collected by 11,146 inward facing 50 cm pmts mounted uniformly on the wall , providing 40% photocathode coverage . in the od ,",
    "1,885 20 cm pmts monitor the 2.5 meter thick veto region .",
    "the veto is used to tag incoming particles and serves as a passive shield for gamma activity from the surrounding rock .",
    "the i d encloses 32,500 metric tons of water in a volume that is 36.2 m in height and 33.8 m in diameter .",
    "the fiducial volume for the solar neutrino analysis starts 2 m inward of the walls of the i d and contains 22,500 metric tons of water .",
    "the i d is accessible by a set of calibration ports 30 cm in diameter leading from the top of the tank directly to the i d .",
    "solar neutrinos measured in sk have energies that range from 5 to 18 mev . at these energies ,",
    "the recoil electron is limited to a few centimeters in range and the vertex position is found using the relative timing of hit pmts , assuming all cherenkov photons came from a single point .",
    "once a vertex is reconstructed , the direction of the electron is determined using the characteristic shape of the emitted cherenkov radiation . since roughly 6 photoelectrons in total",
    "are collected per mev of energy , very few pmts will have more than one photoelectron and the number of hit pmts is used as a measure of the energy .",
    "this number is corrected for pmt dark noise , absorption and scattering of cherenkov photons , and geometrical acceptance of the pmts , which depends on the reconstructed vertex position and direction in the detector .",
    "this corrected number of hit pmts must be properly translated into energy and should be uniform in all directions and throughout the volume .",
    "the linac calibration provides this translation from the corrected number of hit pmts to total energy .",
    "the linac@xcite is located 15 meters from the top of sk , inset into the rock wall of the cavern .",
    "the electron beam is directed in a beam pipe through 9 meters of rock shielding , across the top of the sk tank , and down into the water by a series of bending and focusing magnets .",
    "the beam momentum is adjustable from 5 to 16 mev , matching the range of energies of solar neutrinos .",
    "the absolute energy of the beam is measured with a germanium detector .",
    "linac data taken at several different positions and energies are used to set the absolute energy scale of the monte carlo ( mc ) detector simulation .",
    "the mc extrapolates this calibration to the entire range of energies , over the entire volume , in all directions .",
    "the resulting absolute energy scale is thought to be known with better than 1% uncertainty . to be confident with such a precise measurement , a secondary check with a calibration source of comparable precision is desirable .",
    "the linac calibration has limitations .",
    "the electrons are only moving in a downward direction when they exit the beam pipe , possibly introducing systematic errors due to direction dependences of the detector .",
    "the presence of the beam pipe in the tank while calibration data are taken is another limitation .",
    "while this is modeled in the simulation , it is still the largest source of systematic error for the calibration , especially at low energies .",
    "additionally , the beam pipe and equipment associated with the linac calibration can only be operated at a restricted set of calibration ports , so the calibration must be extrapolated to the entire fiducial volume .",
    "operating the linac also requires a great deal of manpower and results in significant detector down time .",
    "the deuterium - tritium neutron generator ( dtg ) pulsed calibration source was built to address the limitations of the linac calibration system , while providing a cross check of the absolute energy scale .",
    "the dtg creates by the ( n , p ) reaction on in the water of the detector .",
    "the decay of , with a q value of 10.4 mev , is dominated by an electron with a 4.3 mev maximum energy coincident with a 6.1 mev gamma ray and is well suited to check the absolute energy scale for the solar neutrino measurement . with a half life of @xmath1 sec ,",
    "is created _ in situ _ by lowering the dtg into the detector on a computer - controlled crane .",
    "after firing , the dtg is withdrawn , leaving the produced to decay removed from the presence of any calibration equipment .",
    "decays isotropically , making direction dependence studies on the energy scale possible .",
    "the calibration system is designed to be portable , permitting operation at virtually any calibration port , and providing a more complete mapping of the position dependence of the energy scale .",
    "the dtg is also designed to be easy to operate , requiring less manpower and down time for setup and data taking .",
    "the sno experiment uses a similar dtg , externally located to their detector , as a neutron activation source for calibration purposes@xcite .",
    "an additional source of used for calibration at sk is the capture of cosmic ray @xmath0 on .",
    "these events are collected as a natural background in the solar neutrino analysis .",
    "these events occur at a comparable rate to solar neutrinos , and comparing the measured event rate to the expected rate serves as a check of the solar neutrino signal extraction method .",
    "these events , although limited in statistics , can also be used to check the absolute energy scale .",
    "the following sections will describe the two methods by which is produced for calibration in sk , including a description of the experimental setup used in taking dtg data , a discussion of from the capture of @xmath0 , as well as information regarding the simulation of the beta decay .",
    "the results of the analysis of both data sets are also presented .",
    "the used as a calibration source for sk are produced by two different mechanisms .",
    "the first source results from the interaction of 14.2 mev neutrons in the water of the detector .",
    "these neutrons are from a deuterium - tritium neutron generator ( dtg ) , and produce a high statistics sample of at a set position in the detector .",
    "the second source of is the capture of stopped @xmath0 in the water of the detector .",
    "these events , like solar neutrinos , are uniformly distributed throughout the detector volume . for both of these data sets ,",
    "the beta decay of is carefully modeled , and the corresponding mc is compared to the data . since the energy scale of the mc is set by the linac calibration , a comparison of data to mc serves as a cross check of the energy scale .      at the center of the dtg setup is a mf physics model a-211 pulsed neutron generator .",
    "this neutron generator creates neutrons by the deuterium - tritium reaction , +    + @xmath2 + n.    this reaction yields isotropically distributed neutrons with an energy of 14.2 mev .",
    "the neutron generator consists of three main components , ( 1 ) an accelerator control unit , where high voltage ( @xmath3500 v ) , operational interlock , and fire controls are located , ( 2 ) a pulse - forming electronics unit , where the @xmath3100 kv pulses needed by the accelerator are created , and ( 3 ) the accelerator head , containing the deuterium / tritium ion source and target .",
    "for operation at sk , where the separation between the accelerator control unit and the accelerator head could be up to 50 meters , the pulse - forming electronics were repackaged and attached directly to the accelerator head . the combined accelerator head and pulse electronics",
    "are encased in a stainless steel water - tight housing ( figure  [ f : dtinternal ] ) .",
    "the housing measures 150 cm in length and 16.5 cm in diameter , fitting easily into the calibration ports at sk .",
    "the pulse - forming electronics are attached to the accelerator control unit by a cable bundle , containing 10 coaxial cables for high voltage and generator control signals .",
    "these cables pass through an epoxy filled cable feed - through on top of a pvc plate , which serves as the lid for the stainless steel housing . a water leak sensor is also included in the housing so that the generator can be removed in case of a water leak .",
    "an ultrasonic water sensor is also attached to the top of the steel housing and serves as an operational interlock , preventing operation of the generator when not in the detector .",
    "the entire dtg apparatus is moved into position in the detector using a custom built computer - controlled crane .",
    "the dtg generates neutrons by colliding deuterium and tritium ions with a fixed metal hydride target , also containing equal parts of deuterium and tritium .",
    "these ions are created by a penning ion source , using electric and magnetic fields to create a plasma along the source anode , and trapping the resulting electrons which ionize gas in the source region ( see figure  [ f : dtinternal ] ) . the gas pressure is regulated by the gas reservoir element .",
    "the deuterium and tritium ions are accelerated toward the target through an accelerating voltage of 80 - 180 kv .",
    "the target is biased positively with respect to the accelerating anode to prevent secondary electrons from damaging the ion source .",
    "the ion source , accelerating anode and target are enclosed in an evacuated enclosure , which is in turn enclosed in a protective aluminum housing .",
    "the pulse - forming electronics are enclosed in a similar aluminum housing and both units are filled with shell diala ax transformer oil for insulation and cooling . )",
    "reaction on . ]",
    "the neutron generator can be pulsed at a maximum rate of 100 hz , with each pulse yielding approximately @xmath4 neutrons .",
    "the 14.2 mev neutrons produced by the dtg are energetic enough to produce by the ( n , p ) reaction on @xcite in the water of sk , which requires neutron energies greater than @xmath311 mev.@xcite .",
    "the ( n,@xmath5 ) and ( n , d ) reactions on result in the creation of stable isotopes , while the creation of by the ( n,2n ) reaction is energetically forbidden . the ( n , p ) reaction on and are suppressed by the low isotopic abundance and smaller reaction cross sections , which results in yields @xmath6 that of .",
    "a simulation of neutrons in water using gcalor and geant@xcite indicates an expected yield , defined as the fraction of neutrons that create , of 1.3% .",
    "the actual yield of @xmath31% found while taking data at sk agrees with this figure , given the uncertainties in the absolute neutron flux .",
    "these simulations also indicate that the mean distance these neutrons travel in water before they create is about 20 cm .",
    "when taking data at sk , the dtg is lowered to a position 2 meters above the intended production point , and the data taking cycle is started ( figure  [ f : dtoper ] ) .",
    "the data taking cycle is controlled by computer , directing the crane , the generator and data collection of sk .",
    "first , the crane lowers the dtg 2 meters , to the data collection position .",
    "next , the generator is fired , creating a bubble of surrounding the end of the dtg .",
    "every time the dtg is fired , the generator is pulsed 3 times , at the maximum rate of 100 hz , producing @xmath33 million neutrons .",
    "third , the dtg is raised 2 meters , removing the generator from the area containing .",
    "after the dtg is fired , @xmath310 seconds are required before the apparatus is completely withdrawn , and @xmath360% of has decayed .",
    "no data are collected while the crane is moving to prevent electrical noise generated by the crane from contaminating the data .",
    "once the crane has stopped moving upward , data are collected in sk for 40 seconds .",
    "this cycle is repeated @xmath325 times at a single location in the sk tank , yielding a data sample of @xmath3300,000 events collected by sk .",
    "this data sample is later analyzed using the standard analysis tools .",
    "the creation of occurs naturally as a background to the solar neutrino measurement .",
    "a stopped @xmath0 can be captured by a nucleus in the water of the detector ,    + @xmath7 + @xmath8 .",
    "a fraction of created will be in the ground state , and beta decays with a 7.13 sec half life .",
    "these events are found by collecting events that occur in the area surrounding the stopping point of a captured muon and subtracting random background events .",
    "the expected rate of events from muon capture per day in the inner 11.5 kton fiducial volume is given by +    @xmath9 ,    where : +    * @xmath10 is the rate of stopping muons found in the 11.5 kton volume per day .",
    "this rate is measured using the same stopping muon fitter that is used in the search for events and is found to be @xmath11 per day . *",
    "@xmath12 is the fraction of events that are @xmath0 , taken to be @xmath13@xcite .",

    "* @xmath18 is the triggering and reconstruction efficiency for and is determined by mc simulation to be @xmath19 .",
    "this results in a predicted event rate in the 11.5 kton fiducial volume of @xmath20 events per day .",
    "the inner 11.5 kton fiducial volume is chosen for the rate analysis to avoid contamination of the stopping muon sample from misidentification of through going muons near the walls of the detector .",
    "this contamination has no effect on the solar neutrino analysis .",
    "careful modeling of the beta decay is crucial in order to perform accurate mc simulations of data .",

    "these included corrections for nuclear recoil , the nuclear coulomb field , finite nuclear size corrections , dirac wave function corrections , radiative corrections and atomic screening . additionally , the unique first forbidden transitions require corrections for the electron spectral shape@xcite .",
    "these corrections tend to be significant only for very low energy electrons . in our case ,",
    "individual corrections to the peak energy are all @xmath220.2% , and since they have different signs , the overall shift in the peak energy is only 0.14% .",

    "data resulting from the capture of stopped @xmath0 are simultaneously collected during normal data collection runs with solar neutrino events . in order to extract these few events per day from the data set , a specialized data search is implemented .",
    "first , stopping muon events are found and the stopping positions reconstructed .",
    "these fit results are used as an input , along with the input data for the solar neutrino analysis , to the search program .",
    "the search program finds stopping muon events that are not followed by a decay event in 100@xmath23s , as a muon that decays can not be captured on , preventing additional background contributions .",
    "once an `` undecayed '' muon is found , any events in the solar neutrino data sample are saved that occur within 335 cm of the stopping muon point , as well as in a time window of 100 ms to 30 seconds following the stopping muon .",
    "the distance of 335 cm is used as it is large enough to contain all expected signal events while keeping contributions from random backgrounds as small as possible .",
    "no limit is placed on the number of candidate signal events a stopping muon can produce to prevent biasing from the random background in sk .",
    "the result of this search is called the signal sample , and contains the events as well as natural background events . to account for this natural background ,",
    "a so - called background sample is also obtained by offsetting the times of the `` undecayed '' muons by 100 seconds into the future and again performing the same search .",
    "once the signal and background samples are compiled , the solar neutrino analysis algorithms are applied to all events .",
    "the effects of the natural background are removed by performing a statistical subtraction of the results for the background sample from the signal sample . in 1003.8 days of data ,",
    "41,059 signal sample events and 20,025 background sample events are found , resulting in an excess of 21,034 events attributed to decay . in the inner 11.5 kton fiducial volume , 17,714 signal , with 6267 background events",
    "are found in this same live - time period , resulting in a rate of events of 11.4@xmath240.2 events / day .",
    "this result agrees well with the predicted rate of 11.9@xmath241.0 events / day and indicates that no loss of signal is found for events in the same energy range of solar neutrinos .",
    "these data are also used to check the absolute energy scale of the detector by comparing the energy distribution of the background subtracted sample to mc .",
    "a mc event sample is generated with measured decay electron positions used as input vertices .",
    "these events are reconstructed using the same tools as the signal and background samples .",
    "the background subtracted energy distribution is presented in figure  [ f : nat_energy ] along with the results from the mc .",
    "the fitted peak position for data and mc are found and compared , yielding a deviation @xmath25 of + 0.9%@xmath240.7% .",
    "the background subtracted distribution of time since the stopping muon for events is used to measure the half life , and is presented in figure  [ f : nat_halflife ] .",
    "the measured half life of @xmath26 sec is in poor agreement with the expected half life of @xmath27 sec , with a 3.2 sigma difference .",
    "the poor agreement of the half life seems to indicate the presence of contamination in the data sample . has been suggested , with a half life of 2.45 sec .",
    "it can be created by proton emission of some excited states of formed during the capture of the @xmath0 .",
    "little is known about the highly excited states of the nucleus@xcite , and this is taken as a systematic error for this analysis .",
    "the deviation of the measured half life from the accepted value can be interpreted as a @xmath34% contamination from and a mc of decay events indicates that this would shift the energy distribution by -0.4% .",
    "this type of contamination is not energetically possible for the dtg data sample .",
    "additionally , the systematic error in modeling the decay of from the dtg analysis also applies here , resulting in a total energy scale deviation for the @xmath0 capture of @xmath28",
    "the absolute energy scale of the super - kamiokande detector for solar neutrinos has been verified by the decay of . in particular , resulting from the ( n , p ) reaction of 14.2 mev neutrons on water provides a high statistics data sample with comparable systematic uncertainties to the linac .",
    "our analysis shows excellent agreement ( better than @xmath29 ) between data and a linac - tuned mc simulation .",
    "the position and direction dependence of the energy scale have also been studied and are within our systematic uncertainties for the energy scale of the detector .",
    "the analysis of events resulting from the capture of stopped @xmath0 shows good agreement between the expected and measured rates of events and verifies solar neutrino flux measurements .",
    "dtg data are periodically being collected to study the time dependence of the energy scale , and the dtg will continue to be used as a calibration tool for super - kamiokande .",
