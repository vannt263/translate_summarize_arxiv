    "here we will briefly review the geometric optics approach developed in i. the basic assumption is that we may use a ray tracing method to determine the functional form of the high frequency modes , which will in turn give the dominant contribution to the expectation values of squared field operators .",

    "one could also in principle adopt a wavepacket basis , in which @xmath7 is replaced by a localized wavepacket . because the time evolution preserves the klein - gordon norm ,",
    "if the various modes are orthonormal in the past , they will remain so after reflection from the mirror .",
    "thus we can view eq .",
    "( [ eq : mode ] ) as the limit of a set of orthonormal wavepacket modes in which the modes become sharply peaked in frequency and hence delocalized .",

    "the various interference terms in the above expression yield contributions to @xmath0 which are proportional to the inverse square of the appropriate path difference .",
    "thus in the vicinity of the focus , the interference terms between different reflected rays will dominate over that between the incident and a reflected ray . in the present paper",
    ", we will consider cases with no more than two reflected rays , and write @xmath10    in the case of a parabolic cylinder , this may be expressed as @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the path difference for the two reflected rays , and the integration is over the reflection angle of one of the rays .",

    "5 of i are incorrect . in sects .",
    "[ sec : exact ] and [ sec : num ] of the present paper , we will give new results which replace and generalize the older results .",
    "there is an alternative way to implement the above integration by parts prescription .",
    "this is simply to evaluate the integral as an indefinite integral , and evaluate the result at the endpoints , ignoring the singularity within the integration range .",
    "even if it is not possible to find a closed form expression for the indefinite integral , one can expand the integrand in a laurent series about @xmath66 and integrate term by term , using the relation @xmath67 one can verify this relation for the case @xmath68 using the above integration by parts method .    the integrands in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : phisqren4 ] ) and ( [ eq : esqren2 ] ) arise from the integrals @xmath69 and @xmath70 respectively .",

    "the singularities at @xmath66 are due to the contributions of arbitrarily large values of @xmath73 .",
    "if there were to be a physical cutoff at high frequencies , then these singulariries would disappear .",

    "this arises when @xmath52 , the extremum of @xmath24 , approaches the edge of the mirror , @xmath84 .",
    "the mathematical reason for the divergence is that one limit of integration is approaching a point at which @xmath85 and the integrand is singular .",

    "if @xmath174 is of order @xmath175 ( the time needed for an atom with a kinetic energy of order 300k to travel a few centimeters ) , and @xmath147 is of order @xmath176 , the fractional deflection is significant .",
    "an alternative to measuring the deflection of the beam might be to measure the relative phase shift in an atom interferometer , which are sensitive to phase shifts of the order of @xmath177 radians @xcite .",
    "if one path of the interferometer were to be parallel to the focal line at a mean distance of @xmath89 and the other path far away , the phase difference will be @xmath178 both deflection and phase shift measurements would require the atoms to be rather well collimated and localized near the focal line .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic confirmation of enhanced vacuum fluctuations would be the trapping of atoms near the focus .",
    "this would require a mirror with @xmath140 so that there is a region with @xmath142 .",
    "it would also require the atoms to be cooled below a temperature of about @xmath179 thus at temperatures of the order of @xmath180 , atoms could become trapped in a region of the order of @xmath176 from the focus",
    ". this type of trapping would be quite different from that currently employed @xcite in that it would require no applied classical electromagnetic fields .",
    "the peculiar property that the force on an atom can be attractive from certain directions and repulsive from other directions requires some discussion .",
    "if one approaches from an attractive direction , the potential energy is becoming increasingly negative , @xmath181 , whereas from a repulsive direction it is becoming large and positive , @xmath182 . in both cases , @xmath183 for large @xmath89 . at some minimum value of @xmath89 ,",
    "the inverse fourth power behavior has to be modified .",
    "thus the exact potential energy @xmath184 must be a continuous function with a stable minimum , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : potential ] .",
    "note that the requirement that @xmath183 for large @xmath89 in all directions rules out the possibility that there is only a saddle point , and no minimum .",
    "although we can infer the existence of the minimum from our results , the detailed form of @xmath184 near the minimum could only be found by an analysis which goes beyond the approximations made in the present paper .",
    "in this paper we have further developed a geometric optics approach to the study of vacuum fluctuations near the focus of parabolic mirrors .",
    "the main result of this approach is that the mean squared scalar field @xmath0 and mean squared electric field @xmath1 grow as inverse powers of @xmath89 , the distance from the focus , for small @xmath89 .",
    "the key justification of geometric optics is its self - consistency .",
    "when @xmath0 and @xmath1 are large , the dominant contributions must come from short wavelengths for which geometric optics is a good approximation .",
    "this was discussed more quantitatively in sect .",
    "[ sec : limits ] .",
    "we have given some explicit analytic and numerical results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 near the focal line of a parabolic cylindrical mirror .",
    "in this paper , we restricted our attention to the case that the angular size of the mirror , @xmath185 , is less than @xmath186 .",
    "this insures that there are never more than two reflected rays for a given incident ray and simplifies the analysis we find that for smaller mirrors , @xmath137 , @xmath138 and @xmath187 everywhere . in this case",
    ", an atom will feel a repulsive force away from the focus . for larger mirrors , @xmath188 , these mean squared quantities can have either sign , depending upon the direction from the focus . in directions nearly perpendicular to the symmetry axis , @xmath189 , we find @xmath190 and @xmath142 . in this case , the force on an atom is attractive toward the focus and trapping becomes a possibility .    in the geometric optics approximation ,",
    "the mean squared electric and magnetic fields are equal , so the local energy density is equal to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , when @xmath139 , the local energy density is negative , and one has columns of negative energy density running parallel to the focal line of the parabolic cylinder .",

    ", we will develop a method which goes beyond the geometric optics approximation , and use it to estimate the size of the corrections due to diffraction effects . here",
    "we will discuss only a scalar field which satisfies dirichlet boundary conditions on the mirror .",
    "the basic method is to write down and then approximately solve an integral equation for the scattered wave .",

    "we can solve it in an approximation in which an incident wave scatters only once from the surface .",

    "let the incident wave be a plane wave @xmath211 and the surface @xmath200 be the portion of the @xmath66 plane in the interval @xmath212 .",
