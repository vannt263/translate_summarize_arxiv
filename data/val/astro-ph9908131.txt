    "de jong ( 1996b ) and courteau , de jong , & broeils ( 1996 ) have suggested that `` the hubble sequence of spirals is scale - free '' .",
    "they claim that `` the constant ratio of bulge - to - disk scale - lengths appears to be independent of galaxy type '' .",
    "if true , this would not only be at odds with the classification scheme posed by hubble ( 1926,1936 ) and later sandage ( 1961 ) - in which the bulge - to - disk ratio progressively decreases as one goes from early to late type spirals ( simien & de vaucouleurs 1986 ) - but would have consequences for theories of galaxy formation .    while the surface brightness profiles of the disks of spirals are well described by exponential models ,",
    "the light profiles of the bulges are known to possess a range of structural shapes ( andredakis , peletier & balcells 1995 ; carollo , stiavelli & mack 1998 ) .",
    "these can be easily modelled with the sersic ( 1968 ) @xmath4 law .",
    "a generalization of de vaucouleurs ( 1948 ) @xmath1 law , the free parameter @xmath5 can describe the observed range of bulge profile shapes .",
    "indeed , a subset of this model ( namely @xmath5=1 , 2 , 4 ) was applied by de jong ( 1996b ) to the surface brightness profiles of the bulges in his sample of 86 face - on spiral galaxies .",
    "de jong found that 60% of his sample were better modelled ( based on the @xmath6 statistic ) with an @xmath5=1 model , while 40% preferred a larger value of @xmath5 , with 15% preferring @xmath5=4 .",
    "similarly , courteau ( 1996 ) found , when fitting both an @xmath5=1 and an @xmath5=4 profile model , that 15% of the bulges in his sample of spiral galaxies were better modelled with the @xmath5=4 profile ( courteau et al .",
    "1996 ) .    given these results , courteau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reported that late - type spirals are best fitted by two exponential models , and they chose to represent all their spiral galaxies this way .",
    "subsequently , their claim for a scale - free hubble sequence for spirals was based upon structural parameters obtained from fitting exponential light profile models to both the disk and the bulge .",
    "however , the above percentages become most interesting when one notes that the galaxies preferring the larger values of @xmath5 are the early - type spirals , while the late - type spirals prefer values of @xmath5@xmath71 ( andredakis et al .  1995 ; moriondo , giovanardi , & hunt 1998 ) . additionally , andredakis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown that the bulge - to - disk ratio of luminosities varies systematically with profile shape , such that galaxies with larger bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio have larger shape parameters .",
    "logically , any conclusions drawn from structural parameters which have ignored these structural differences must surely be questioned ( moriondo et al .",
    "1998 ) . by using the best - fitting profile models ( either @xmath5@xmath81 , 2 , or 4 ) this paper reinvestigates the claim for a scale - free hubble sequence of spiral galaxies",
    "we have re - analyzed the data presented by courteau et al .",
    "they presented two data sets , however , only one is appropriate for explorations of galaxy properties as a function of morphological type .",
    "lahav et al .  ( 1995 ) showed that the dispersion in galaxy type index , t , between six experienced galaxy classifiers was on average 1.8 t - units , and 2.2 t - units when comparing the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) t - index with those of the six classifiers .",
    "a similar figure of disagreement ( 2.0 - 2.5 t - units ) was obtained by four human classifiers of hst images ( odewahn et al .",
    "1996 ) . unfortunately , because of this , the larger of the two data sets presented in courteau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) - 243 sb  sc galaxies from the 349 sb",
    " sc galaxies of courteau ( 1996 ) - can not in themselves be used to explore possible trends within the hubble sequence of spiral galaxies .",
    "what the r - band data of courteau ( 1996 ) does enable , is to show that the individual ratios of bulge - to - disk scale - lengths span a broad range of values ( courteau et al .  1996 ,",
    "figure 1 ) .",
    "scale - length ratios within just one standard deviation of the median are shown to span a range greater than a factor of 4 , with the 1@xmath9 confidence interval ranging from 0.029 to 0.135 , and a long tail in the distribution stretching to 0.35 . to obtain the ratio of the bulge effective radius @xmath10 to the disk scale - height @xmath11",
    ", these numbers should be multiplied by 1.679 , giving ratios of @xmath2 up to @xmath70.6 .",
    "therefore , in passing , we stress that caution should be employed when using any sort of mean bulge - to - disk scale - length ratio , since a broad range of values spanning one order of magnitude exists amongst the real galaxy population .    the second data set , that of de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 ) , is however useful .",
    "it includes galaxy types from sa through to sm .",
    "this sample of 86 galaxies actually includes two s0 galaxies which are removed here as de jong ( 1996b ) notes that their surface brightnesses are significantly below the trend seen for the rest of the spiral galaxies , and their connection with the early - type spiral galaxies is still unclear .",
    "the sole irregular galaxy ( t=10 ) is also removed , leaving 83 face - on ( minor over major axis ratios greater than 0.625 ) sa to sm galaxies , imaged in six passbands ( bvrihk ) .",
    "in recent years , some of the limitations of the classical surface brightness profile models , such as the exponential or the @xmath1 law , have been realised .",
    "departures in the radial falloff of light from these models has been not only detected but successfully modelled for : the dwarf galaxy population ( davies et al .",
    "1988 ; young & currie 1994 ; binggeli & jerjen 1998 ) , the ellipticals ( caon et al .  1993 ; graham & colless 1997 ) , brightest cluster galaxies ( graham et al .",
    "1996 ) , and for the bulges of spirals ( andredakis et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "the sersic ( 1968 ) law has proved successful in parameterizing such departures from the traditional models and can be written as @xmath12 \\nonumber \\\\      & = & i_{e}\\exp \\left [ -(2n-0.327 ) \\left\\ { \\left ( \\frac{r}{r_e } \\right ) ^{1/n } -1 \\right\\ } \\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first line shows how the intensity @xmath13 varies with radius @xmath14 ; @xmath15 is the central intensity where @xmath14@xmath80 .",
    "we use @xmath16 here to denote the bulge scale - length and avoid confusion with the disk scale - length which is denoted by @xmath11 elsewhere in this paper . the third model parameter , @xmath5 , describes the level of curvature in the light profile . for example , when @xmath5=1 the sersic law is equivalent to an exponential light distribution ; when @xmath5=4 it mimics the de vaucouleurs @xmath1 law .",
    "the value of @xmath5 is of course not restricted to integer values and remains meaningful up until values of around 10 - 15 .",
    "the second line is a variant of the first expression , with the model parameters now @xmath17 , the intensity at the radius @xmath18 which encloses half of the total light of the bulge . equating like - terms",
    ", one has that @xmath19@xmath8@xmath20 and @xmath21@xmath8@xmath22 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath5@xmath81 , @xmath10@xmath81.67@xmath16 , and when @xmath5@xmath82 , @xmath10=13.5@xmath16 .",
    "one can also easily see why effective radii rather than scale - lengths are used for the @xmath1 law , since @xmath16=@xmath10/3466 .",
    "given that this paper uses parameters from @xmath5=1 , 2 , and 4 sersic models , we have used effective radii rather than scale - lengths .    de jong ( 1996a ) fitted three models to the surface brightness profiles of the bulges , all with an accompanying exponential profile model to the disk .",
    "the goodness - of - fit for each model was measured using the @xmath6 statistic . for the b , v , h and k passbands ,",
    "it is observed that for every two galaxy bulges that are best fit with an @xmath5=2 or @xmath5=4 profile , there are three galaxy bulges whose best - fitting profile model is the @xmath5=1 model . for the r and i passbands , the number of galaxy bulges best fit with the @xmath5=1 model",
    "equal the number of bulges better fitted with the alternative @xmath5=2 or @xmath5=4 models ( table  [ chi2-tab ] ) .    in using the best - fitting bulge models",
    "( either @xmath5@xmath81 , 2 , or 4 ) the associated model parameters were not always reliable .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1 model sometimes resulted in values for @xmath10 that were either inaccurately determined and/or were unrealistically large . to accommodate for this",
    ", each value of @xmath10 was inspected and the galaxy either retained , or rejected if @xmath23@xmath2440% or @xmath25@xmath240.5 , where @xmath26 is the maximum radius for which the the surface brightness profiles extend ( @xmath726@xmath271 in b ) .",
    "this typically resulted in the exclusion of only 1 or 2 galaxies from each of the morphological type bins t=1 - 3 and t=7 - 9 used in this comparative study .",
    "table  [ stats - tab ] shows the difference in the mean value of @xmath2 for the early- and late - type morphological class bins used by courteau et al .",
    "it shows this ratio for the k- and r - band data fit with an exponential bulge model by de jong ( 1996b ) and courteau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . using the best - fitting @xmath5@xmath81 , 2 , and 4 models , we present this difference of means for all six passbands ( bvrihk ) . however , this difference in the ratio is meaningless on its own .",
    "what is important is the significance of this difference , and this depends on the sample size and standard deviation of the distributions . to this end , we have applied student s t - test .",
    "the probability , prob(t ) , that the difference in means could be as large as it is by chance is given in table  [ stats - tab ] ; small values indicate that the means are significantly different from each other .",
    "the majority of the early - type spirals ( @xmath28sb ) prefer to have values of @xmath5@xmath241 , while late - type galaxies ( @xmath29sd ) are better fit with an exponential bulge ( see table  [ chi2-tab ] ) .",
    "the universal application of the exponential fitting function ignores from the start real differences in galaxy structure , and introduces a systematic bias into the parameterization of these galaxies - under - estimating the effective half - light radius of the bulge .",
    "modelling of the light profiles of elliptical galaxies ( graham & colless 1997 , figure 11 ) . ]",
    "figure  [ 4to1-fig ] shows the ratio of the effective radii derived from the @xmath1 model ( @xmath30 ) and the effective radii derived from the exponential model ( @xmath31 ) , plotted against the ratio of the exponential model disk scale length co - fitted with the @xmath1 bulge model ( @xmath32 ) and the exponential disk scale length co - fitted with the exponential bulge model ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it shows that @xmath34@xmath241 , while the exponential disk scale - length remains largely unchanged as the bulge profile model is adjusted .",
    "similarly , fitting an @xmath5=1 profile will over - estimate the half - light radii for some of the late - type spirals .",
    "although de jong ( 1996a ) shows for the late - type spirals that an @xmath5=1 model provides a better representation of the bulge than an @xmath5=2 or @xmath5=4 model , he also notes that values as low as @xmath5=0.5 are obtained when applying the sersic profile to the bulge ( de jong 1996a ) .",
    "furthermore , andredakis et al .  (",
    "1995 ) , in fitting the sersic model to the k - band bulge light profiles of 30 spiral galaxies , found some sb  sd galaxies to have bulge profiles with shape parameters smaller than 1 .",
    "consequently , restricting the structural profiles of all late - type galaxies to be described by an @xmath5=1 model may be increasing their mean bulge scale - length and hence reducing the true difference between the @xmath2 ratio of the early- and late - type spirals .",
    "that is , the probabilities in table  [ stats - tab ] may be larger than they should .",
    "as stated by de jong ( 1996b ) , k - band data is the passband of choice for such studies , making it `` possible for the first time to trace fundamental parameters related to the luminous mass while hardly being hampered by the effects of dust and stellar populations . ''",
    "indeed , some of the galaxies in de jong sample were noted to possess dust lanes and circumnuclear star formation .",
    "furthermore , bulges are brighter in k than in b with respect to the disk , and since the bulge / disk decomposition is easier when the bulge is relatively brighter , the fitting algorithm therefore works better in the k - band ( de jong 1996b ) .    using exponential bulge models , courteau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) mention that the @xmath2 ratios of the early - type spirals appear systematically below the average @xmath2 value for all spiral galaxy types .",
    "they assert that this difference is not large , and claim that the constant ratio of bulge - to - disk scale - length is independent of hubble type .",
    "however , our analysis of the exponential models fitted to the k band data of de jong ( 1996b , figure 18 ) reveals that the mean value of @xmath2 for the sa ",
    "sb type galaxies is actually smaller than that for the late - type spirals at a significance of 98% ( 3@xmath3 ) ! ( table  [ stats - tab ] ) .",
    "similarly , with the r - band data presented by courteau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and in fact for all wavelengths used ( excluding the v - band ) , the ratio of @xmath2 is smaller for the sa  sb galaxies than it is for types @xmath29sbc .",
    "this result is at odd with the classical picture of the hubble sequence , where early - type spirals have larger bulge - to - disk scale - length ratios than late - type spirals . due to the use of exponential bulge models for the sa ",
    "sb type galaxies , the above result can be understood in terms of systematically under - estimating the size of these bulges . correcting for this , by taking the best - fitting structural parameters , from either the @xmath5=1 , 2 , or 4 models , we find that the situation reverses itself . the average value of @xmath2 for the sa ",
    "sb type galaxies is found to be larger than the average value of @xmath2 for galaxy types @xmath29sd , in all six passbands .",
    "table  [ stats - tab ] shows that the probability that the sa ",
    "sb type galaxies have the same mean @xmath2 as the sd  sm type galaxies is weakly ruled out at the 1.52 @xmath3 level in five of the six passbands used by de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 ) .",
    "interestingly , it is the k - band data which suggest that the difference in means is not significant .",
    "however , this result in itself is significant when compared to the result obtained using only exponential bulge profile models . using the best - fitting models ,",
    "the average @xmath2 ratio for the sample is larger  at the 3 @xmath3 significance level  than when obtained using only the @xmath5=1 model .",
    "we plan to refine this work by fitting a sersic profile with free ( i.e.  not fixed ) shape parameter , @xmath5 , to the bulges of the spirals in the sample of de jong & van der kruit ( 1994 )",
    ". furthermore , courteau et al .  (",
    "1996 ) noted that about 1/3 of the sample of galaxies from de jong ( 1996a ) had a bar modelled as an additional component - requiring eight structural model parameters for these galaxies .",
    "while de jong modelled a bar when fitting the exponential bulge models to the 2d images , his one - dimensional decomposition technique which he used to fit the @xmath1 and @xmath0 bulge models did not allow for the influence of a bar .",
    "subsequently , we must caution that failure to model the bar in the 1d data used here may influence the scale - lengths obtained .",
    "arguments for secular evolution , namely the exponential bulge light profile and the restricted range of bulge - to - disk scale - lengths , are either wrong or questionable .",
    "andredakis et al.s ( 1995 ) alternative to secular evolution - based upon the continuous trend between galaxy structure , as measured by @xmath5 , and galaxy type - is largely supported by the data of courteau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in the framework of this model , n - body simulations ( andredakis 1998 ) have shown how the imprint of disk formation is left upon the bulge , creating the observed trend between shape parameter and morphological type .",
    "yet another alternative is offered by aguerri & balcells ( 1999 ) , where the shape of the bulge grows from an @xmath5=1 profile to larger values of @xmath5 as shown through n - body simulations of merger events .    whether the bulges of spiral galaxies formed after the disk , as in the secular evolution model ( courteau et al .",
    "1996 ) , or , whether the bulge is in fact older than the disk ( andredakis 1998 , and references within ) may be better answered when the range and trends of bulge - to - disk ratios are better known .",
