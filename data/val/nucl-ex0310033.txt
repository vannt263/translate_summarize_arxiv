    "projectile fragmentation at high energies ( @xmath1 gev ) has proven to be a powerful tool to produce clean secondary beams of exotic nuclei that can be used for a wide variety of nuclear - structure , nuclear - reaction , or nuclear - astrophysics studies . to make full use of this potential of projectile fragmentation",
    ", the reaction mechanism has to be understood in detail in order to predict precisely the properties of the secondary beams .",
    "pioneering experiments were performed at the lbl bevalac accelerator  @xcite .",
    "later , more detailed studies have been undertaken at the sis / frs exotic beam facility at gsi , darmstadt @xcite .",
    "comprehensive datasets have been obtained with respect to formation cross sections of exotic fragments as well as their kinematic properties ( mainly centroids and widths of longitudinal momentum distributions ) . both types of observables could be fitted by empirical parametrizations : the former by the widely used epax parametrization  @xcite , the latter by the morrissey systematics  @xcite .",
    "these parametrizations have turned out to be useful within simulation programs of projectile fragment separators ( e.g. mocadi  @xcite or lise  @xcite ) .",
    "more insight into the underlying physical processes was provided by comparison to physical models like abrasion - ablation ( abrabla  @xcite ) or intranuclear - cascade models ( isabel  @xcite ) .",
    "since most projectile - fragmentation experiments aim at producing exotic nuclei near the limits of the presently known regions , and since the fragment neutron- or proton - excess is correlated with the neutron- or proton - excess of the projectile  @xcite , fragmentation of stable projectiles outside the valley of @xmath2-stability has received most interest .",
    "quite a few studies of neutron - rich projectiles like @xmath3ca , @xmath4kr , and @xmath5xe have been reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "on the proton - rich side , fragmentation cross sections for @xmath6ni , @xmath7sn , and @xmath8xe have been published  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the empirical epax parametrization could fit the measured cross sections with good accuracy down to sub - nanobarn levels  @xcite .",
    "the present paper aims at complementing the data base for the fragmentation of proton - rich projectiles by studying @xmath0ar fragmentation .",
    "the isotope @xmath0ar is important for producing light proton - rich nuclei at the proton drip line ; their properties can be compared to those from @xmath9ar fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the formation cross sections ( down to a level of @xmath10barn ) , widths of longitudinal momentum distributions could be measured ; both will be compared in the following to the respective systematics as well as to physical model predictions .",
    "the results reported in the present paper were obtained as a by - product of a secondary - reaction experiment aimed at measuring total interaction cross sections of ar and cl isotopes @xcite as well as measuring longitudinal momentum distributions of knock - out products in coincidence with @xmath11-rays  @xcite .",
    "this is the reason for certain experimental limitations of the present experiment that will be discussed below .",
    "the experiment was undertaken at the sis / frs facility at gsi in darmstadt , germany  @xcite .",
    "sis delivered a @xmath0ar beam with 1050 @xmath12 mev in spills of 8 @xmath13 duration with a repetition rate of 1/16 @xmath14 .",
    "typical beam intensities varied between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ions per spill , depending on the cross section to be measured .",
    "the primary - beam intensities were measured with a secondary - electron transmission monitor ( seetram )  @xcite that was calibrated with respect to a fast scintillator detector .",
    "fragments were produced in a thick ( 1625 mg/@xmath17 ) @xmath18be target located at the entrance of the frs .",
    "fragments were identified with respect to their nuclear charge , @xmath19 , and their mass - over - charge ratio , @xmath20 , by a combination of energy - deposition , magnetic rigidity and time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements .",
    "the set - up used is shown in fig.[f : frs ] .",
    "while in principle both observables can be measured in both sections of the frs , only the first half up to f2 was used to identify and count the fragments . to this end",
    ", the energy deposition in an ionization chamber at f2 was measured together with the time of flight ( tof1 ) between scintillators `` sc1 '' and `` sc2 '' . positions and angles at f2 could be determined with the help of two position - sensitive detectors ( tpc ) .",
    "the tof was calibrated with the primary @xmath0ar beam from sis with several known energies which allowed to determine the length of the flight path and the offset . together with magnetic rigidity ( @xmath21 ) determined from hall - probe measurements and corrections for deviations from the optical axis , the tof gave @xmath20 of the fragments . at the same time , the velocity - dependent energy deposition of the beam was recorded and calibrated in terms of nuclear charge , @xmath19 .",
    "typical results of the isotope identification obtained are visualized in fig.[f : id ] .",
    "the non - observation of the unbound nuclei @xmath22na and @xmath23f allowed to verify independently the isotope identification .",
    "in the present experiment , the requirements of the main secondary - reaction study dictated an experimental setup that was not optimum for the present purpose .",
    "the main limitation was the width of the f1 start scintillator ( `` sc1 '' in fig.[f : frs ] ) of only 2 cm in x- ( bending ) direction .",
    "this leads to important cuts in the fragment longitudinal momentum distributions such that several @xmath21 settings had to be analyzed to cover the entire phase space distribution of each fragment .",
    "each @xmath21 setting allowed to produce a two - dimensional spectrum as the one shown in fig.[f : id ] . for each isotope selected by a two - dimensional condition in fig.[f : id ] , its x - distribution in the f2 momentum - dispersive focal plane was converted to a longitudinal momentum distribution and properly normalized with the help of the seetram beam current detector .",
    "the reconstructed magnetic rigidity distribution of the isotope @xmath24o is shown in fig.[f : br ] .",
    "the reconstructed gaussians for each isotope yield directly the average longitudinal momentum in the laboratory frame and the momentum width . from their areas ,",
    "production cross sections can be determined once the necessary corrections have been applied .",
    "an important ingredient in determining the production cross sections is the transmission calculation . in bending direction",
    ", a @xmath21 scan allows to cover the entire longitudinal momentum distribution of each fragment or at least to cover enough momentum space that a gaussian fit to the data is possible .",
    "the same is not possible , however , perpendicular to the bending plane .",
    "this means that the angular acceptance for each isotope has to be calculated numerically , based on its measured longitudinal momentum width and assuming that longitudinal and transverse momentum widths are identical .",
    "the numerical procedures have been published in ref .",
    "it is well known that the momentum widths depend approximately on the square root of the mass difference between projectile and fragment ( e.g. ref .",
    "consequently , the transmission of fragments close to the @xmath0ar projectile ( like the ar or cl fragments in table  [ table1 ] ) are transmitted with about 100% , whereas the isotopes @xmath25n are transmitted only with about 33% efficiency .",
    "further corrections to the isotope yields are due to the dead time of the data acquisition ( approximately between 50% and 70% ) and secondary reactions of the produced residues in the target ( of about 10% ) .",
    "finally , the observed number of counts of each isotope is converted to a cross section using the number of target atoms and the number of incident ions as determined from the seetram beam intensity monitor .",
    "the resulting production cross sections for 38 isotopes are listed in table  [ table1 ] and visualized in fig.[f : xsec ] .    0.7    [ table1 ]    ._production cross sections of neutron - deficient fragments from @xmath0ar measured at 1050 @xmath12 mev _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the present data constitute an excellent data base to benchmark the predictive power of different fragmentation models at the limit of unbound nuclei . at these energies ,",
    "the fragmentation process is described in terms of a two - step model . in the first step",
    ", the collision between the nucleons in the overlap region between projectile and target leads to the formation of two residues of both reaction partners called prefragments , with similar kinematical properties , smaller mass and a given excitation energy . in the second step ,",
    "the residues of both reaction partners release their energy excess by evaporating nucleons and @xmath11-rays .",
    "the proximity of the investigated nuclei to the proton drip line is expected to increase the sensitivity of their production cross sections to the excitation energy induced in the first stage of the collision or the competition between proton and neutron evaporation during the second stage .    to investigate the reaction mechanism leading to the formation of the measured nuclei we have performed calculations using two different models to describe the first stage of the reaction , the intranuclear - cascade model isabel @xcite and the abrasion model of gaimard and schmidt @xcite .",
    "both models were coupled to the abla evaporation code @xcite to describe the second stage of the reaction .",
    "these two models follow completely different approaches . in the intranuclear - cascade model isabel",
    ", the interaction between projectile and target is described as a sequence of elastic or inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "the moving nucleons follow classical trajectories and the only quantum mechanical ingredient is the pauli blocking .",
    "nucleons with sufficiently high momenta can leave their respective nuclear volumes , the leftover nucleons form the prefragment .",
    "the final prefragment excitation energy is obtained from particle - hole excitations in the initial fermi distribution of the removed nucleons plus the energies of the scattered nucleons that end up below the `` cutoff energy '' ; the latter has been introduced to terminate the history of cascade nucleons with energies too low to escape their respective potential wells  @xcite .",
    "the abrasion model follows geometrical considerations , the size of the projectile and target prefragments is given by the non - overlapping region between both partners , which is defined by the impact parameter .",
    "the excitation energy induced in the collision is determined by the energy of the holes of the removed nucleons , assuming a fermi distribution of nucleons inside the nucleus , which has been empirically demonstrated to be on average around 27 mev per abraded nucleon  @xcite .",
    "other than the physical models discussed above , the empirical parametrization of fragmentation cross sections , epax  @xcite , has little physical input and merely aims at reproducing measured data by numerical expressions .",
    "such an approach is nevertheless useful e.g. for planning experiments or for cases where fast iterative calculations of secondary cross sections are needed . in the present context",
    ", the epax formula is particularly useful since it contains a parametrization of the `` memory effect '' , i.e. the influence of the proton excess of the projectile on the proton excess of the fragments . as explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the numerical form of this `` memory effect '' has been adjusted to measured @xmath6ni fragmentation cross sections .",
    "a comparison with the present high - precision @xmath0ar cross sections can serve as a check of the predictive power of epax for proton - rich projectiles .    in figure",
    "[ f : xsec ] we compare the measured production cross sections with the results of the calculations obtained with the intranuclear - cascade model isabel ( dotted lines ) and the abrasion model of gaimard and schmidt abra ( dashed lines ) coupled with the abla evaporation model .",
    "the predictions obtained with the semi - empirical parametrization epax are included in this figure as well ( solid line )",
    ".    in general the three calculations provide a very good description of the measured cross sections even for weakly bound nuclei at the proton drip line .",
    "only a detailed comparison shows some trends .",
    "the isabel calculation seems to overestimate the production cross sections of heavy - projectile residues while the abrasion model provides an excellent description of all the data .",
    "since both calculations use the same evaporation model the observed deviations must be due to the different models used to describe the first stage of the collision .",
    "in addition , residues close to the projectile do not reach the limiting fragmentation regime and consequently their production cross section is sensitive to the entrance channel .",
    "the observed overestimation of the production cross section with isabel can be explained if one considers that this code produces fragments with 20% less excitation energy on average than the abra code . as pointed out ,",
    "the production of heavy projectile residues is very much affected by the first stage of the collision .",
    "in particular , a lower excitation energy leads to shorter evaporation chains and consequently an increase of the production cross section of heavy residues .",
    "the good description of these data with the abrasion - ablation model abrabla confirms its predictive power and validates the physical assumptions used in this code .",
    "+ the overall agreement of the measured production cross sections with the epax formula  @xcite is excellent , as can be seen in fig.[f : xsec ] . the present experiment reaches the proton drip line up to @xmath26 , al .",
    "even drip - line nuclei are produced with cross sections that lie well on the epax predictions .",
    "this confirms observations that were made for another neutron - deficient projectile , @xmath6ni  @xcite .",
    "our new data for @xmath0ar ( @xmath27 ) allow to test the epax predictions for the production of exotic nuclei over a wide range of projectile-@xmath28 values by comparing them to similar data from @xmath29ar ( @xmath30 ) on @xmath31c at 222 @xmath12 mev  @xcite .",
    "we assume that for both incident energies , 222 and 1050 @xmath12mev , the cross sections are largely energy - independent , so that epax can be applied .",
    "[ f : ar3643 ] demonstrates that at least the proton - rich slopes of the @xmath0ar - induced distributions and the neutron - rich slopes of the @xmath29ar - induced distributions are correctly predicted by epax .",
    "similarly good agreement was found for isotope distributions from @xmath32ru and @xmath32zr fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "a precise knowledge of the kinematics of high - energy projectile fragmentation is essential to correctly predict the yields of secondary beams from an in - flight separator like the frs .",
    "we have discussed in subsect._3.1 _ how the transmission of the frs is affected by the momentum distributions .    in the traditional two - step model of high - energy projectile fragmentation , the momentum widths are largely determined by the random addition of the fermi momenta of the nucleons that are knocked out in the first ( `` abrasion '' ) phase of the reaction .",
    "the corresponding prefragment momentum widths have been given by goldhaber  @xcite as @xmath33 where @xmath34 refers to the projectile ( prefragment ) mass ; the latter can not be observed . the quantity @xmath35 denotes the fermi momentum of the nucleons in the projectile .",
    "subsequent evaporation ( `` ablation '' ) of nucleons in the second phase additionally broadens the momentum distributions somewhat , but the most important effect here is that the number of nucleons is reduced , so that the original `` goldhaber '' distribution becomes flatter and can be better described ( at least for fragments close to the projectile mass ) by morrissey s formula  @xcite : @xmath36 where now @xmath37 denotes the ( observed ) fragment mass .",
    "systematic studies of the validity of the morrissey systematics have been undertaken about a decade ago at the frs ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "up to about a mass loss of 10 units , the present data follow nicely the morrissey systematics ( dashed curve in fig .  [",
    "f : pwidth ] ) . for fragments further removed from the projectile , however",
    ", the widths tend to saturate .",
    "similar observations were made in a comprehensive study of @xmath4kr fragmentation at 500 @xmath12 mev  @xcite , where it was found that the widths even became smaller again for fragments with masses smaller than about half the projectile mass .",
    "one practical solution is to keep the goldhaber formula ( eq .  [ eq : gold ] ) but fit the width coefficient @xmath38 to the measured data of fig .",
    "[ f : ar3643 ] ( full line ) .",
    "this leads to a parameter of @xmath39  mev / c , smaller than the goldhaber prediction ( for _ prefragments _ ) of @xmath40 mev / c .",
    "the latter value is based on a fermi momentum in @xmath0ar of @xmath41250 mev / c  @xcite .",
    "the smaller @xmath42 value reflects the evaporation mass loss as discussed above .",
    "it compares well with other data found in the literature for light nuclei , e.g. viyogi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) found @xmath43  mev / c for @xmath9ar at 213 @xmath12mev .",
    "we have studied the fragmentation of neutron - deficient @xmath0ar at relativistic energies and have obtained precise values for production cross sections and longitudinal momentum widths of very neutron - deficient fragments , reaching the proton - drip line up to aluminum .",
    "both observables can be reproduced well by their respective empirical parametrizations : the cross sections match excellently those predicted by the epax formula , thus confirming its validity also for the case of very neutron - deficient projectiles .",
    "the longitudinal momentum widths are best fitted by a modified goldhaber formula , where the width constant @xmath38 is replaced by an empirical value .",
    "the measured production cross sections are also compared with physical - model calculations performed with ( i ) the isabel intranuclear - cascade model , and ( ii ) the gaimard - schmidt abrasion model , both coupled to a standard evaporation code ( abla ) .",
    "the isabel code gives an overall good description of the data however , some discrepancies are observed for the heavier residues . for",
    "these nuclide very close to the projectile the isabel code clearly overestimate the production cross sections .",
    "this result is interpreted as a consequence of an underestimation of the excitation energy induced in the reaction ; lower excitation energies lead to shorter evaporation chains which increase the production of residues close to the projectile .",
    "the abrasion model abrabla provide an extremely good description of all the data .",
    "these results indicate that in the range of fragment masses studied here the assumption of a two - stage model works well ; the model consists of a fast removal of quasi - free nucleons during the geometrical overlap of projectile and target , followed by evaporation of particles from a thermally equilibrated prefragment .",
    "in addition , we confirm the predictive power of the abrasion code that can also be used to describe the production of residual nuclide in more complex reactions where the epax formula can not be applied , as it is the case for fissile projectiles .",
    "the authors wish to express their gratitude to their colleagues from the accompanying experiments for their help with the experimental setup .",
