    "one of the insights provided by observations of seyfert galaxies and some quasars is the prevalence in their x - ray spectra of spectral lines and bound - free continua from ions of intermediate - z elements .",
    "early observations of seyfert 1 galaxies using proportional counters and solid state detectors revealed spectra with strong absorption features in the 0.1 - 10 kev range @xcite .",
    "these features were attributed mostly to the edges of hydrogen and helium - like oxygen .",
    "the term `` warm absorber '' was proposed owing to the fact that the observed x - ray absorbing gas has an electron temperature lower than it would be if a similar level of ionization were produced by collisional ionization .",
    "however , more detailed spectroscopic studies were hampered by the limited x - ray resolution of the asca and rosat satellites .",
    "the grating spectrographs on the x - ray telescopes _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ provide unprecedented spectral resolution up to @xmath0 .",
    "these show that x - ray spectra obtained from @xmath1 half of low - red - shift active galactic nuclei ( agn ) contain many lines from ions of fe , si , s , o , mg , and ne , and that these are generally broadened and blueshifted by 100 - 500 km / s @xcite .",
    "the presence of x - ray absorbing gas has been confirmed in the majority of agns which are bright enough to allow detections @xcite .",
    "there is also a partial correspondence between uv and x - ray absorbers @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of warm absorbers are consistent with the seyfert 1/seyfert 2 dichotomy .",
    "for example , the properties of the x - ray emission in the seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 1068 corresponds to the scattered emission expected from warm absorbers in seyfert 1 galaxies @xcite .",
    "constraints on the position and dynamics of the x - ray absorbing gas can be deduced from the observed widths and virial arguments , and also from the variability studies of these spectra @xcite .",
    "these show an absence of correlated response of the warm absorber gas to rapid changes ( @xmath1 days ) of the continuum .",
    "this implies that the ionization time scale in the warm absorber gas is long ( @xmath2 months ) .",
    "combined together , the line blueshifts , widths , and time variability analysis favors an origin of the warm absorber gas at @xmath3 away from the bh .",
    "this estimate coincides with the likely location of absorbing matter responsible for obscuration in seyfert 2 galaxies @xcite .",
    "the existence of an outflow from the torus has been suggested by @xcite , and as the source of warm absorber flows by @xcite .",
    "it is believed that this matter is in the form of a molecular torus which is responsible for obscuring the broad line region in seyfert 2 galaxies , and which is thought to exist in most low and intermediate luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "a growing body of direct observational evidences advocates for the existence of the obscuring torus .",
    "mid - infrared high spatial resolution studies of the nucleus of ngc 1068 using the very large telescope interferometer have resolved a dusty structure which is 2.1 pc thick and 3.4 pc in diameter  @xcite .",
    "observations support a multi - temperature model : the temperature of the warm component was established to be 300 k and inside of it a second , compact and hot ( @xmath4800k ) component has been found .",
    "further studies of ngc 1068 systematically reduced estimates of the temperatures of different components @xcite .",
    "observations of the circinus galaxy , which is among the closest prototype seyfert 2 galaxies , also revealed a dense and warm @xmath5 k component at about @xmath6 from bh and cooler @xmath7 k component at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "if the hotter component is located closer to the x - ray source , it may be attributed to the inner part of the torus , heated by the radiation of the compact nucleus .",
    "although the evidence is strongest for nearby active galaxies , there is also a strong motivation to think that within the same obscuring torus paradigm exist those quasars whose central regions are heavily obscured by gas and dust ( type ii quasars ) .",
    "evidence for this comes from spectro - polarimetric observations by @xcite .",
    "this paper is part of a series whose main goal is to test the hypothesis that the torus is the origin for the warm absorber flow .",
    "preliminary results of this work have been reported in  @xcite ( paper 1 ) , in which we presented the results from a sample model and showed that the adopted model is promising in explaining the warm absorber phenomenon . in this paper",
    "we provide more details of our methods , and display results of models which span the space of input parameters .",
    "we present and discuss the hydrodynamic quantities which characterize our models : mass fluxes , velocity fields , and temperature structure .",
    "we also show sample x - ray spectra , which we will discuss extensively in a later paper of this series .    our approach can be described as having three basic parts : i ) setting up initial conditions , which requires defining an initial torus configuration and making assumptions about the external source of radiation ; ii ) implementation of the wind driving force ( local heating - cooling rates and radiation pressure force ) and actual 2d hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "the latter includes the numerical solution of the time - dependent 2d ( so called 2.5d ) system of equations , which takes into account centrifugal forces , and radiation pressure and heating terms ; iii ) calculating of the x - ray line spectra using a code which adopts sobolev radiation transfer and ionization calculations for plasma in the intense x - ray field .",
    "each of these steps is described in what follows .",
    "we solve the following system of equations :    @xmath9    these are the conservation equations for : mass , momentum and energy .",
    "heating and cooling processes are described by the function @xmath10 ; @xmath11 - is the sum of the kinetic and internal energy densities : @xmath12 .",
    "these equations should be supplemented by the equation of state which we assume to be polytropic : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the polytrope index and @xmath16 . a one - component , one - temperature @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mean molecular weight per particle , @xmath19 is the universal gas constant and plasma with @xmath20 is assumed to constitute the flow .",
    "all three components of the flow velocity @xmath21 are calculated , assuming azimuthal ( @xmath22 ) symmetry .",
    "equations ( [ eqcont])-([eqenergy ] ) are cast in a non - dimensional form with the characteristic scales set by the properties of the plasma orbiting at a characteristic distance , @xmath23 from a black hole of mass @xmath24 ( in units of @xmath25 ) .",
    "the characteristic scales are respectively : @xmath26 for the time , where @xmath27 is the distance in parsecs , and @xmath28 for the velocity .",
    "the forces accelerating the wind in our model result from the gradient of gas pressure and from radiation pressure .",
    "the thermodynamic properties of x - ray heated gas depend on the spectrum of the incident radiation as well as on the local atomic physics . under the assumption of photo - ionization equilibrium the thermodynamic state of photoionized gas",
    "can be parameterized in terms of the ratio of radiation energy density to baryon density @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the local x - ray flux , @xmath31 is the x - ray luminosity of the nucleus , and @xmath32 - is the optical depth , and @xmath15 is the number density .",
    "we assume that the attenuation is dominated by thomson scattering @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the mass fraction of hydrogen , and the factor @xmath35 , accounts approximately for the attenuation of the radiation flux on the way from the source toward a fiducial point .",
    "the methods adopted in this paper for treating the effects of radiation are essentially the same as those described in @xcite , and have been applied to various problems in the study of agn and x - ray binaries .    assuming that the there is a fraction @xmath36 of the total accretion luminosity @xmath37 available in x - rays and that the disk radiates a fraction @xmath38 of its eddington luminosity @xmath39 we estimate : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the column density in @xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "if the dynamical time within the flow is much larger than the characteristic time of the photoionization and recombination then the ionization balance is determined by the condition of photo - ionization equilibrium .",
    "the rates of compton and photo - ionization heating and compton , radiative recombination , bremsstrahlung and line cooling are then given by approximate formulas , modified from those of @xcite , for these processes :    @xmath44    [ heating1 ] for the compton heating - cooling ;    @xmath45    [ heating2 ] for the photo - ionization heating - recombination cooling , and for the bremsstrahlung and line cooling :    @xmath46    these formulae have been originally derived for a 10 kev bremsstrahlung spectrum ( @xmath47 k ) and were found to be in a reasonable ( @xmath48 ) agreement with numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "equations ( [ heating1])-([heating3 ] ) are slightly modified version of those of @xcite , which accommodates new atomic data . using the xstar code @xcite we recalculated heating - cooling rates for the incident spectrum which is a power law with energy index @xmath49 , and found results essentially equivalent to those given by equations ( [ heating1])-([heating3 ] ) .",
    "notice that in the case of a bremsstrahlung spectrum a formal value of @xmath50 should be used in ( [ heating3 ] ) .",
    "for a power law with energy index @xmath51 the results differ by @xmath52 30 @xmath53 ( see figure [ figheatcool ] ) . given these rates of energy deposition from the radiation to the flow ,",
    "we write the total radiative heating - cooling function : @xmath54 .",
    "we have also performed several runs of our hydrodynamical models with different assumptions about heating - cooling , and found no important difference in the flow dynamics if using equations ( [ heating1])-([heating3 ] ) or the original formulae of @xcite , and also between bremsstrahlung and power law spectra for several values of @xmath49 .",
    "it appears that , for example , the effects of the optical depth are much more important .",
    "that is , the difference between curves for the power law and the bremsstrahlung spectrum at small @xmath55 ( correspondingly high density ) in figure [ figheatcool ] becomes unimportant .",
    "the radiation pressure force consists of the force due to continuum absorption @xmath56 and due to lines :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the force multiplier @xcite , and @xmath59 is the local uv flux .",
    "we make use of the particular form @xcite :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 is the optical depth parameter , @xmath62 is the line strength parameter , @xmath63 is the thomson cross - section , and @xmath64 .",
    "a parameter @xmath65 was introduced by @xcite and @xcite in order to limit the effect of very strong lines .",
    "that is , they assume a line number distribution which satisfies : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the line number distribution . if @xmath68 , so that lines are distributed as a power law , one recovers the result of @xcite : @xmath69 . in the opposite case of @xmath70 , the force multiplier is independent of @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . as a result of this maximum line strength cutoff",
    "a correction factor appears in the relation for @xmath58 , ( [ mt1 ] ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath73 and @xmath74 on @xmath55 has been numerically calculated and then fitted by the analytical formulae @xcite : @xmath75    @xmath76 from these , one can see that @xmath58 can depend sensitively on the ionization parameter . taking a fiducial @xmath77 ( the value , adopted in all our calculations )",
    ", one finds that @xmath78 at @xmath79 , then has two local maxima : @xmath80 at @xmath81 , and @xmath82 at @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 then drops to @xmath85 at @xmath86 and decreases gradually to @xmath87 at @xmath88 .",
    "we begin from a rotating toroidal configuration which is in equilibrium in the external gravitational field of the bh .",
    "the equation of state of the torus interior is described by the polytrope @xmath89 .",
    "the distribution of the density ( or pressure ) in the torus interior was given by @xcite ( in what follows refer to pp - torus for short ) , who assumed that the distribution of the specific angular momentum inside the torus is constant .",
    "in our case such a torus would not be in equilibrium because of the radiation pressure from the central object .",
    "thus we modify equilibrium equations of @xcite to include the radiation pressure term .",
    "since this can not be done in a closed analytical form , we can write an approximate equation :    @xmath90    note that equation ( [ pp - torus ] ) must be understood as a bridging formula between two limiting cases : optically thin @xmath91 ( in which case it is the pp - torus with @xmath92 reduced gravity ) , and optically thick , when @xmath93 ( pp - torus case ) .",
    "a constant @xmath94 in the equation ( [ pp - torus ] ) , parameterizes the distribution of the torus models and is connected with the distortion of the torus ( this is described in more detail below ) . including the radiation pressure",
    "reduces the effective gravity , and thus the torus gas needs less entropy to sustain it against vertical collapse . in both of these limiting cases",
    "this equation is exact .",
    "notice that the problem of toroidal equilibrium in the presence of heating ( or other radiation transfer effects ) introduces a characteristic length scale through the optical depth @xmath95 , leading to non - self - similarity of the model .",
    "equation ( [ pp - torus ] ) was derived by assuming that the distribution of the specific angular momentum inside the torus is constant .",
    "choosing non - dimensional units and working in terms of @xmath96 , the cylindrical radius in units of @xmath23 , if we define the non - dimensional density @xmath97 such that @xmath98 , and the non - dimensional pressure @xmath99 and internal energy @xmath100 such that : @xmath101 , and @xmath102 then @xmath103 .",
    "the inner and outer edges of the torus are located at @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively . bounded",
    "configurations exist only for @xmath106 and the distortion of the torus is described by the parameter @xmath107 .",
    "the boundary of the torus is matched to the exterior by the condition @xmath108 .",
    "the pp - torus is unstable to _ non - axisymmetric _",
    "perturbations @xcite .",
    "however , this effect can not be numerically investigated in the azimuthal symmetry which we adopt , since no signals can propagate in the @xmath109 direction . at @xmath110 ,",
    "matter that constitutes the torus has an excess of angular momentum with respect to the local equilibrium keplerian value , @xmath111 , and vice versa , in the inner parts of the torus @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "it is the internal pressure of the torus  ( equation [ pp - torus ] ) that inhibits matter from settling to smaller ( or larger , depending on angular momentum ) orbits .",
    "the gas first evaporates from the part of the torus which is closer to the source of radiation and tends to settle at larger @xmath96 , as soon as the back pressure supporting it drops .",
    "we begin our simulations from the stationary configuration determined from equation ( [ pp - torus ] ) .",
    "we follow the torus evolution as it is being heated by x - rays .",
    "no replenishing of the gas which constitutes the initial torus is provided : therefore , the torus will eventually lose all its mass and will completely evaporate .",
    "however , in the regime we are looking for , the evaporation is not dramatic and does not significantly deplete the torus during the characteristic dynamical time .    in the following sections we will show that the existence and character of the flow from the heated torus depends critically on the geometry .",
    "that is , it depends on the divergence of the flow streamlines , the strength and incident angle of the x - ray illumination , and on the direction of the effective gravity in the rotating frame of the torus .",
    "the flow is intrinsically two - dimensional , and therefore can not be adequately described _ a priori _ by 1d models , such as those preformed by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the shape of the torus , and thus the launching surface for the flow , is affected by the flow .",
    "so the torus interior can not be considered as a boundary condition ( e.g. as in @xcite ) ; we need to include it in the computational domain .",
    "for our computations we adopt a spherical - polar coordinate system @xmath114 , extending the computational domain @xmath115 from @xmath116 to @xmath117 in radius , and from @xmath118 to @xmath119 in the polar domain making no assumption about equatorial symmetry . the number of points in the radial , @xmath120 , and polar , @xmath121 , directions are taken to be equal : @xmath122 , in low resolution and @xmath123 in high resolution grids .",
    "the @xmath124 grid is non - uniformly spaced , i.e. @xmath125 , and @xmath126 , for @xmath127 , and the refinement factor is @xmath128=4 . in order to achieve better resolution of the flow itself rather than the torus interior",
    "we also adopt a polar grid which has non - uniform spacing @xmath129 , so that the maximum refinement is approached at @xmath130 : @xmath131 at @xmath132 , and @xmath130 : @xmath133 at @xmath134 ( and analogously spaced in the southern hemisphere ) .",
    "boundary conditions are axially symmetric at @xmath135 and outflowing at @xmath136 and @xmath137    to solve numerically the system of hydrodynamical equations ( [ eqcont])-([eqenergy ] ) we use the code zeus2d  @xcite .",
    "note that the characteristic time of x - ray heating / cooling can be much shorter than the dynamical time , which in such a case introduces strong stiffness to the system of equations ( [ eqcont])-([eqenergy ] ) . to overcome this difficulty , some modifications have been made to the code .",
    "the most important one is the implementation of a fully implicit update of the energy in equation ( [ eqenergy ] ) just prior to the transport step in zeus2d .",
    "addionally , we account for the radiation pressure ( equation ( [ radforcelines ] ) ) term . as an initial test",
    "we have evolved a toroidal distribution of matter for two rotational periods and found the configuration to be stable .",
    "the gas is illuminated by the incident x - ray radiation with a power law spectrum with an energy index , @xmath138 .",
    "the heating / cooling rates are described by the approximate analytical formulae give in equations ( [ heating1])-([heating3 ] ) .",
    "we test output of our hydrodynamical models against the ability to predict warm absorber spectra .",
    "to do this we use the output from the hydrodynamical code , of @xmath139 , and @xmath140 as an input to the calculation of x - ray line and photoelectric absorption spectra .",
    "the numerical code has been specifically developed for calculation of spectra in the x - ray domain and makes use of procedures developed for the xstar @xcite code , while calculating the ionization structure and distribution of opacities , and treating the radiation transfer in the sobolev approximation @xcite .",
    "although the goal of this paper is to show that pure hydrodynamic 2d models can produce warm absorber spectra , we present here only sample spectra , assuming pure absorption .",
    "we postpone a more detailed discussion , including a full 3d transfer calculations , to a separate publication .",
    "the most important parameters which determine the properties of the warm absorber flow are the initial compton optical depth @xmath141 of the torus ( or equivalently the maximum initial torus density @xmath142 ) , and the distance from the bh , @xmath23 .",
    "we also explore the dependence on @xmath38 and @xmath143 .",
    "other parameters are chosen having some typical values : the mass of the black hole : @xmath144 , the compton temperature of the x - ray radiation @xmath145 , and the fraction of x - rays and uv radiation @xmath146 .",
    "( for rotating flows exposed to a multi - temperature radiation , see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is consistent with typical energy distributions of the radiation close to the bh @xcite .",
    "we neglect any changes in the bh luminosity .",
    "the important thermal time scales within the flow , namely the compton heating and cooling time , @xmath147 and the dynamical time , @xmath148 , may be of the same order @xmath149 .",
    "this is discussed in more detail later in this section .",
    "thus the outflowing gas may not be in thermal equilibrium and adiabatic losses are likely to be important .",
    "notice that a nearly hydrostatic compton heated corona can exist only at @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the compton temperature in terms of @xmath152k . in all of our models",
    "the major flow is located at @xmath153 .",
    "we have calculated 20 models , including combinations for : @xmath154 , and 40 ( models @xmath155 ) ; @xmath156 ; @xmath157 all with @xmath158 ; and two models with @xmath159 ( models @xmath160 ) .",
    "these are summarized in table 1 where some of the characteristic results from the computed models are presented . in what follows",
    "we describe in detail the cases which best illustrate the most important results .",
    "we also discuss the dependence of our results on parameters , based on the behavior of the ensemble of models .",
    "the model @xmath161 is similar to that described in paper 1 , although the initial torus in the model which is described here has a different distribution of @xmath97 and @xmath100 ( see equation ( [ pp - torus ] ) , and the discussion thereafter ) , and smaller @xmath162 . in paper 1 this model has been described in detail .",
    "calculations presented here reveal more details and confirm the conclusions of paper 1 .",
    "we begin here by describing results from model @xmath163 , and later discuss how it differs from model @xmath161 .",
    "model , @xmath163 has @xmath164 , @xmath165 and @xmath166 and corresponds to a compton thick ( @xmath167 ) torus having large @xmath168 and mass @xmath169 .",
    "results are displayed in figure [ fig1_0 ] , where the evolution of the distribution of density is shown as a function of time ( the density scale is such that 0 corresponds to @xmath170 ) ; figure [ fig1_2 ] where the distribution of pressure is shown at @xmath171 ( the pressure scale is such that 0 corresponds to @xmath172 ) ; figure [ fig1_1 ] for various quantities as a function of the inclination @xmath173 ; figure [ fig2_0 ] ( left panel ) , where the effect of the distortion parameter @xmath143 is demonstrated ; and figure [ fig2_1 ] showing horizontal slices of the velocity and temperature at constant height , @xmath174 . in the case of this model , the torus column is high enough to effectively screen the torus interior from penetrating x - rays .",
    "this leads to formation of a nearly pure funnel flow , i.e. the torus interior , and hence the shape of the surface responsible for launching and collimating the flow , is essentially unaffected by x - ray heating on time scales @xmath175 .    here and in what follows",
    "we discuss the time evolution of our models in terms of @xmath71 , measured in units of the characteristic time of rotation , @xmath176 .",

    "the distortion parameter has a value @xmath180 , i.e. the torus shape is almost unchanged from its initial value .",

    "we see that there exists a region , behind the dense torus , where outflow is switched to inflow .",
    "this gas rejoins the torus in the shadowed region .",
    "for example , taking the model @xmath161 , and integrating the mass flux over the region where @xmath374 , we obtain @xmath375 at t=3 .",

    "matter that is removed from the funnel is replaced by gas from the torus interior .",
    "thus , a weak large scale convection flow is observed in the simulations .",
    "this effect is most clearly seen in models with large @xmath143 , such as model @xmath258 , shown in figure [ fig2_0 ] and is due to a strong drop of @xmath382 as the outflowing gas is passing the shock wave front behind the torus ( c.f .",

    "is determined mainly by the properties of the x - ray heating ( i.e. @xmath395 ) rather than by the attenuation of the uv flux . at",
    "higher @xmath173 smaller maxima occur at smaller @xmath396 ; the inner skin of the torus exerts considerable radiation pressure , although at large @xmath173 it is opposed by the back pressure of the torus interior .",
    "we calculated a model which has the same parameter values as model @xmath161 but with @xmath397 . at @xmath171 this model gives @xmath398 and @xmath399 . comparing with table 1 values",
    "we see that for the range of angles where warm absorber flow is observed the radiation pressure does nt play a major role in the flow acceleration . in models @xmath155 the attenuation is much stronger than in models @xmath250 and consequently the secondary maxima of @xmath394 which were observed in models @xmath250 are suppressed by the @xmath35 attenuation .",
    "the radiation pressure is important only on the skin of the torus but almost everywhere points in the wrong direction , opposing the back pressure of the torus interior . only at @xmath400",
    "it points in the direction tangential with the torus surface , but as @xmath401pc the density drops and @xmath55 rises so that @xmath402 becomes small .",
    "if the interior of the torus is optically thick to x - rays then the torus loses mass mostly from the surface , much as in the self - excited wind scenario for x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "as shown above , in such a case the torus throat serves as a funnel and the gas is injected to the flow from the funnel walls .",
    "notice that the location of the narrowest part of this funnel determines the characteristic terminal speed of the wind . in order to explore this ,",
    "we have made a set of runs similar to models @xmath298 and @xmath161 , but with reduced @xmath162 . for model @xmath404 which has @xmath405 and @xmath406 , we find that for @xmath407 and @xmath408 , the maximum velocity @xmath409 equals @xmath410 . for model @xmath411 which has @xmath405 and @xmath165 ,",
    "we find @xmath412 for the same @xmath173 .",
    "if in the latter model we make optical depth smaller , @xmath413 we obtain : @xmath414 .",
    "this shows , in accord with our expectations of the mass flux conservation , that the torus is losing mass from deeper inside .",
    "as shown in table 1 , reducing @xmath23 has the effect of increasing the maximum velocity .",
    "an increase of @xmath38 has the same effect .",
    "however , this maximum velocity may be observed at a different inclination .",
    "increasing the distortion parameter , @xmath143 has an effect of some increase of the maximum velocity , redistributing @xmath415 to higher inclinations . from numerical solution",
    "we notice that the torus aspect ratio , @xmath416 does not strongly influence the evolution .",
    "that is because it is the most inner part of the throat which determines the dynamics of an evaporative flow .",
    "this inner throat is located at high @xmath173 so that it remains optically thick most of the time .",
    "numerical experiments confirm that the geometry of this inner throat remains approximately unchanged in time .",
    "figure [ fig1_0 ] shows that the geometry of the innermost part of the torus , i.e. the densest part ( roughly located between 0.5 and 2 pc ) shrinks considerably in the vertical direction during the process of the evolution .",
    "this is the result of the joint action of the radiation pressure and the back pressure of the hot evaporative flow .",
    "this is particularly interesting as it resembles the geometrically thick outskirts of agn accretion disks which are known to be unstable to self - gravity @xcite .",
    "the physics of such systems is complicated , and is subject to various possible competing effects .",
    "the self - gravitating instability may operate also in the torus body , perhaps leading to a dynamical system of molecular - dusty self - gravitating clouds ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , the optical depth of the torus , @xmath417 is crucial as in the optically thin case the torus will effectively cool and collapse to a thin disk with subsequent star formation @xcite . in the other extreme ( @xmath418 )",
    "the released energy can go to increase the velocity dispersion of the clouds , effectively supporting the torus thickness  @xcite .",
    "strong ir radiation pressure exerted on these clouds , which can come from internal reprocessing of x - rays , can produce significant vertical force @xcite , and may suppress the self - gravity instability and at the same time provide pressure support against vertical collapse @xcite . vertical support , and partial suppression of gravitational collapse ,",
    "may also be provided by radiation pressure from star formation within the torus or the obscuring flow @xcite .",
    "further heating and loosing mass induces a torus to expand and change of shape .",
    "we have calculated models @xmath163 and @xmath161 with 100x100 resolution further in time to learn the late time evolution . at @xmath419 in the @xmath163 model",
    "the torus has two extended lobes in both hemispheres with an opening angle @xmath420 .",
    "they have a certain degree of asymmetry with respect to the equatorial plane .",
    "the shape of the obscuring structure no longer resembles the initial torus ; the column densities are in the range of @xmath421 at @xmath422 , and @xmath423 at @xmath422 .",
    "the radial velocities in this structure are in the range of @xmath424 .",
    "our model does not allow for the replenishing of the torus ; obviously the torus will evaporate completely if given enough time .",
    "thus , in the the model @xmath161 the torus evaporates completely by the time @xmath425 .",
    "these results imply that in order to get a quasi - stationary warm absorber flow the replenishing time should be of the order of the mass - loss time",
    ". the whole torus configuration may be unstable in a secular sense ; the instability is driven by the long characteristic time of the _ global _ torus heating / cooling ( due to expansion , winds , radiation loses ) , advection of heat in the torus body by internal flows etc .",
    "for example , the mass - loss rate , @xmath426 ; the surface area @xmath427 increases during the torus expansion .",
    "if after some time of extensive heating , the torus separates into several parts , further mass loss will increase due to the larger total surface area of the fragments .",
    "we have studied x - ray excited winds from the putative gas - dusty torus in agn .",
    "we approach this problem using numerical methods combining detailed hydrodynamical modeling with calculation of the warm absorber spectra .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations include two - dimensional , axially - symmetric rotating flow , driven primarily by x - ray heating .",
    "compton , bremsstrahlung , and photoionization heating / cooling processes were taken into account as well as the radiation pressure force , which was calculated in the sobolev approximation .",
    "a code combining xstar for photoionization calculations with the sobolev radiation transfer has been developed for the calculation of the spectra .",
    "we find that a rotationally supported torus heated by radiation from the inner accretion disk and black hole can indeed be a source of the material we observe in the warm absorber flow .",
    "we find that the inner throat of the torus is not only important as a source of the gas but also because it creates a funnel for the outflowing wind .",
    "this leads generally to larger velocities within the funnel , and different velocity distribution within the warm absorber flow from those derived from models based on spherically - symmetric winds .",
    "the wind mass - loss rate within the funnel is not very sensitive to the details of the initial torus distribution and approaches @xmath428 .",
    "strong x - rays heat the gas within the funnel , producing a fast , @xmath429 , ionized flow near the axis , and slower , @xmath430 , flow closer to the funnel walls .",
    "this is where optical depth effects become important and a warm absorber spectrum is produced . using methods",
    "developed in studies of x - ray binaries we were able to estimate the mass - loss rate from such funnel flow , finding it to be in a good agreement with our numerical solution .",
    "the funnel flow is found to be promising with respect to obtaining high velocity warm absorber flows .",
    "what is beyond the scope of our models is the possibility of having multiple phases in such high velocity flow , on spatial scales smaller than our grid resolution .",
    "our treatment of the gas thermal properties will produce two - phase behavior at our grid resolution ; we do not find this behavior , owing to the fact that the cooling timescales are generally too long .",
    "the answer to the question of whether there can be high velocity bullets or embedded clouds  on length scales smaller than the resolution of the grid is related to the problem of the origin of broad and narrow uv / optical line emitting clouds , and requires different computational methods from those employed here .",
    "our models which have initial compton depths @xmath431 , aspect ratio @xmath432 , and located at @xmath433 pc predict warm absorber spectra , thus confirming the main conclusion made in paper 1 .",
    "the existence of such spectra depends on the fact that the flow is intrinsically two - dimensional , meaning that both the dynamics of the funnel flow is different from 1d models and optical depth effects are important as they strongly depend on inclination .",
    "the latter point requires that we include the entire torus in the computational domain rather than considering it as a boundary condition .",
    "the distribution of the ionization parameter , @xmath55 depends strongly on @xmath173 , further confining the range of angles where conditions are right for the warm absorber flow to be observed . in most of our models",
    "warm - absorber - like spectra are produced in a @xmath434 range , at @xmath435 .",
    "this range is set both by the initial aspect ratio of the torus , which we take to be @xmath436 , and by the thickness of the x - ray heated skin of the torus .",
    "more optically thin models produce warm absorber - like spectra for @xmath437 , as they potentially provide more partially optically thin gas for evaporation .",
    "the bulk of the gas in this scenario has a terminal velocity of the order of the escape velocity at the inner torus edge . because of the funnel mechanism part of",
    "the gas is re - distributed to lower inclinations and acquires a higher terminal speed , @xmath438 . in a real agn environment",
    "such flow may contain clumps and irregularities and even dust , which are not captured in our studies because of the intrinsic limitations our methods .",
    "accounting for the multiple phases of a gas ( on a subcellular level ) may reveal this in more detail and may also broaden the range of angles where the warm absorbers appear .",
    "the part of the flow that is shielded by the optically thick part of the torus body can also flow out as part of a torus global expansion .",
    "thus it strongly depends on the deposition of energy directly to its interior .",
