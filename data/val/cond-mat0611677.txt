    "magnetic information storage is one of the major applications of magnetic nanoparticles , though magnetic nanoscale structures in general have been identified as offering a great potential in applications ranging from nano `` spin '' electronics , innovative complex materials like magnetically controlled shape memory alloys to medical applications in medical diagnosis and therapy .",
    "the objective of achieving high - density requires rather small sizes , high anisotropies , and imposes severe constraints on the microstructure and the magnetic properties to ensure a good stability against thermal demagnetization over several years . on the other hand ,",
    "the same material must be magnetized by the writing head in a time interval as short as a nanosecond .",
    "however , smaller sizes induce stronger surface effects and higher densities induce stronger inter - particle interactions .",
    "unfortunately , surface effects and inter - particle interactions have the drawback to negatively affect the signal - to - noise ratio . optimising the underlying material in view of technological applications",
    "requires taking account of and understanding the effects of surface and interactions , both on the static and dynamic level . at present",
    "there are mainly two types of nanoparticle samples : i ) assemblies of nanoparticles embedded in a non - magnetic matrix with volume distribution and randomly oriented easy axes , with negligible to strong dipole - dipole inter - particle interactions ( ddi ) @xcite .",
    "ii ) isolated single particles measured by the technique of @xmath0-squid @xcite . from a theoretical point of view , none of these sample prototypes is so far fully satisfactory : while in the case i ) one can measure by commercial squid most of the magnetic properties , e.g. , field - cooled ( fc ) , zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) magnetization and ac susceptibility , in a wide temperature range ( 4.2 - 300k ) and in any applied magnetic field available ( 0 - 30 t ) , this case presents tremendous difficulties for modeling because of the volume and anisotropy easy axes distributions and ddi . indeed , these interactions , because of their long - range character , together with the two distributions , require prohibitively long cpu times to deal with realistic assemblies of , say @xmath1 particles of @xmath2 spins each .",
    "besides , the physical quantities , such as the magnetization of the assembly , are only known on average . in the case",
    "ii ) , one gets rid of these difficulties but then the experimental results are limited to low temperature and applied field , and more importantly the magnetization itself is not accessible , and for very small particles the signal is rather  noisy \" , which hinders any measurement of hysteresis loops , and one makes do with the angular dependence of the switching field , the so - called _ stoner - wohlfarth astroid_. in many theoretical approaches the magnetic state of a small magnetic particle is represented by a single magnetic moment regardless of its microscopic origin , this is the _ one - spin approximation _ , or one - spin problem ( osp ) , which can only be justified for particles that are not too large to be single - domain , and not too small to be surface - effects free . within this approximation ,",
    "it is well known by now that the magnetization of a nanoparticle can overcome the anisotropy - energy barrier and thus reverse its direction , at least in two ways : either under applied magnetic field which suppresses the energy barrier , or through thermally activated statistical fluctuations .",
    "switching under applied field , at zero temperature , is described by the stoner - wohlfarth ( sw ) model @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has recently been shown @xcite , experimentally and theoretically , that efficient magnetization switching can also be triggered by transverse field pulses of a duration that is half the precession period .",
    "the sw model accounts for the hysteretic reversal of a magnetic moment over the potential barrier under the influence of the magnetic field applied in an arbitrary direction and at zero temperature .",
    "in fact , at zero temperature the magnetization switching is only possible when the field reaches a critical value that suppresses the energy barrier .",
    "at finite temperature and short - time scales , crossing of the energy barrier is triggered by statistical thermal fluctuations and is described by the nel - brown ( nb ) model @xcite and its extensions , which took several years to be fully accomplished [ see the review article @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "both the sw and nb models have been confirmed , to some extent , by experiments on individual cobalt particles @xcite through measurements of the switching field distribution , the non - switching probability , and the time evolution of the direction of the particle s magnetization . at finite temperature , but at quasi - equilibrium , the magnetization switching occurs according to two distinct regimes @xcite : at very low temperature , switching operates by coherent rotation of all spins , as in the sw model , whereas at higher temperatures , the magnetization switches by changing its magnitude .",
    "the latter effect results in a shrinking of the sw astroid as qualitatively described by the modified landau theory @xcite , and confirmed by experiments @xcite . however , it is clear that the change of the magnetization magnitude during its switching can not be explained in the framework of the osp approximation .",
    "indeed , it can only be understood as the result of a successive switching of individual ( or clusters of ) spins inside the particle @xcite , which should then be necessarily dealt with as a many - spin system . in more general terms , the picture of a single - domain magnetic particle with all spins pointing into the same direction , leading to coherent relaxation processes becomes unsatisfactory as soon as one comes to deal with small particles with a surface that makes up to @xmath3 of the total volume .",
    "this is to say , the surface entails strong effects that can not be neglected .",
    "in fact , deviations from the osp approximation , and thereby from both the sw and nb models , have been observed in metallic particles @xcite , ferrite particles @xcite , and maghemite particles  @xcite .",
    "these deviations have materialized in terms of the absence of magnetization saturation at high fields , shifted hysteresis loops after cooling in field , and enhancement at low temperature of the magnetization as a function of the applied field . in most cases",
    ", surface effects happen to be strong enough as to compensate for the work needed against the exchange energy that favors full alignment , and it is conceivable then that the magnetization vector points along the easy axis in the core of the particle , and then gradually turns into a non - collinear direction when it approaches the surface .",
    "moreover , in addition to exchange interactions , which are the strongest interactions between atomic moments in a magnetic system , there are also the purely magnetic dipole interactions between the magnetic moments of the atoms and the interactions between the magnetic moments and the electric field of the crystal lattice ( spin - orbit interactions ) .",
    "the last two types of interactions , being relativistic in origin , are much weaker than the exchange energy on a short - distance scale . however , on a long - distance scale they are non - negligible because they are of long range .",
    "these interactions have two important features : they induce inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the magnetization , and introduce a preferred direction in the system @xcite . roughly , ddi lead to two energy terms corresponding to the volume and surface charges . in a small magnetic system , such as a nanoparticle ,",
    "only the second contribution is significant and it accounts for the shape anisotropy , and the former becomes negligible as one integrates over a small volume @xcite .",
    "therefore , to study a small magnetic system where inhomogeneities are necessarily present , one has to take into account all different contributions to the energy : exchange and ddi , core and surface anisotropies , and zeeman energy .",
    "so , one of our goals is to understand surface effects on the thermodynamic and spatial behavior of the magnetization in small systems .",
    "this is also of crucial importance to the study of their dynamics .",
    "however , this requires a microscopic approach that accounts for the local environment inside the particle and the above mentioned contributions .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to a rather difficult , if not insuperable , task owing to the large number of degrees of freedom which hinders any attempt to analyze the energyscape whose knowledge is indispensable for understanding the dynamics and switching mechanisms .",
    "for this reason , inter alia , calculations of the reversal time of the magnetization of fine single - domain ferromagnetic particles , for instance , initiated by nel @xcite , and set firmly in the context of the theory of stochastic processes by brown @xcite , have invariably proceeded by ignoring all kind of interactions .",
    "thus , the only terms which are taken into account in these calculations are the internal magneto - crystalline anisotropy of the particle , the random field due to thermal fluctuations , and the zeeman term @xcite . however , before attacking the general problem of the effect of interactions and that of the surface on the dynamical properties , one has to gain a sufficient understanding of the static properties . yet before tackling the effect of surface anisotropy , one has to clearly define , understand , and when possible evaluate in a separate way , finite - size effects ( artificially ) induced in theoretical calculations by considering a system of finite size , and  true \" boundary effects ( naturally ) induced by crystal field symmetry breaking on the surface .",
    "finite - size effects in magnetic systems have been of much interest for decades now , and have been extensively studied by many authors  @xcite , just to cite a few .",
    "one of the difficulties , inherent to systems of  round \" ( spherical or ellipsoidal ) geometries , as is the case with nanoparticles , is the separation of boundary effects due to defects in coordination on the boundary and the unavoidable finite - size effects . in hypercubic systems ,",
    "this problem is handled by using periodic and free boundary conditions , but this is not possible in other topologies , and thus boundary and finite - size effects are tangled together .",
    "more difficulties come into play when the spins on the surface are attributed some anisotropy .",
    "while for thin films and layered systems the direction of the anisotropy on the surface is clearly determined and its intensity estimated  @xcite , especially in @xmath4 elements , for various thicknesses , no definite answer is yet available for nanoparticles .",
    "nevertheless , there are some estimations of the surface anisotropy constant  @xcite obtained in an indirect way by fitting magnetic measurements and assuming an effective anisotropy constant .",
    "unfortunately , today the experimental techniques are not so advanced as to allow for probing the crystallographic structure of a nanoparticle surface , in the same manner as is done for @xmath5 magnetism , and hence no information is yet available as to the precise nature of the anisotropy on the surface . as such ,",
    "theorists have no definite answer as to what is the most adequate model for describing surface anisotropy in nanoparticles .",
    "to the best of our knowledge there are mainly two models with positive or negative constants : the _ transverse surface anisotropy _",
    "( tsa )  @xcite model where a surface spin is attributed a single - site anisotropy axis that is normal to the surface , and nel s model ( nsa )  @xcite .",
    "one may also find in the literature a model with random anisotropy .",
    "nel s model is more physically plausible because the anisotropy at a site occurs only if the latter presents defects in its environment , e.g. , if it lacks some of its neighbors .",
    "when a nanoparticle is embedded in an assembly dispersed in a non - magnetic matrix ( of polymer , silica , etc . ) , still more interesting challenging physical phenomena are observed , such as the disappearance of the maximum of the temperature at the peak of the zero - field - cooled magnetization of an interacting assembly , the magnetization enhancement at low temperature and high field in dilute maghemite particles  @xcite , and the appearance of spin - glass states at low temperature in concentrated assemblies  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the volume and anisotropy easy axes distributions , particle assemblies also introduce a new physical parameter , namely the inter - particle interactions , as discussed earlier , and in particular ddi .",
    "these interactions have been studied for many decades in different areas of physics , and in particular in magnetism  @xcite .",
    "there is an overwhelming literature investigating the influence of ddi on both static and dynamic properties of nanoparticles , and it would be almost impossible to provide a fair account of all of them . however , we do not know of theoretical work that deals with ddi between particles taking at the same time account of their internal structure and thereby surface effects . in ref .",
    ", the landau - lifshitz thermodynamic perturbation theory  @xcite is used to tackle the case of weakly dipolar - interacting monodisperse assemblies of magnetic moments , in the osp approximation , with uniformly or randomly distributed anisotropy axes .",
    "the authors studied the influence of ddi on the susceptibility and specific heat of the assembly . on the other hand ,",
    "monte carlo technique has been used to study the effect of ddi ( of arbitrary intensity ) on the temperature behavior of the coercive field and remanent magnetization in a uniform assembly of magnetic moments  @xcite .",
    "the situation involving both surface effects and ddi has never been considered so far because of its tremendous complexities . needless to say that , already at the static level , no exact analytical treatment of any kind is ever possible even in the osp approximation , i.e. , ignoring the internal structure of the particles .",
    "this review is organized as follows : in section ii , which deals with the intrinsic features of nanoparticles , we emphasize the difference between finite - size , boundary and surface effects . then we introduce our many - spin approach and discuss and compare two surface anisotropy models ( transverse and nel ) .",
    "next , we present and interpret some of the main results on the static behavior of many - spin particles , and in particular on the role of surface anisotropy .",
    "we end this section with a discussion of the crossover between the osp and msp regimes .",
    "section ii deals with the collective behavior of nanoparticle assemblies with special emphasis on ddi : i ) we summarize our work on the effect of anisotropy and weak ddi on the magnetization of a polydisperse assembly of magnetic moments , i.e. , osp particles .",
    "we provide the corresponding approximate analytical expressions and compare them with monte carlo simulations .",
    "ii ) we investigate the effect of ddi on the zfc magnetization , and in particular on the temperature at its maximum as a function of the applied magnetic field .",
    "iii ) we end this section with a very short discussion , together with a preliminary result , of assemblies of non - interacting msp particles .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , when dealing with fine magnetic systems , such as a nanomagnet , one should distinguish , at least from a theoretical point of view , between finite - size , boundary , and surface effects .",
    "for instance , for a simple cubic ( sc ) lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ pbc ] left ) with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) , there is only one environment ( crystal field ) with coordination number @xmath6 .        in this case , the temperature behavior of the magnetization is marked by the well - known @xmath7 tail in the critical region , where @xmath8 is the total number of spins in the particle ( fig .",
    "[ pbc ] , right ) .        in the case of more realistic free boundary conditions ( fbc ) ,",
    "a cube with sc structure shows four different environments with @xmath9 ( see fig .",
    "[ fbc ] left ) . in this case ,",
    "in addition to the previous finite - size effects , one is faced with boundary effects .",
    "these induce stronger fluctuations that suppress the magnetization of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fbc ] right ) . considering both cases of pbc and fbc allows for a separate estimation of the related effects .",
    "now , if the boundary of a system with fbc is endowed with a surface anisotropy , which is indeed a consequence of boundary defects , we may then speak of surface effects , in addition to the finite - size and boundary effects .    for both pbc and fbc ,",
    "we have shown @xcite that the magnetization can be written in a simple form . at low temperatures and zero field",
    "@xmath10 deviates from 1 , its saturation value , according to @xmath11 where @xmath12 and for a three - dimensional ( @xmath13 ) sc lattice @xmath14 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath15 in ( [ wn ] ) for pbc and fbc differ only by the definition of the discrete wave vectors , since @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 this subtle difference is responsible for much stronger thermal fluctuations in the fbc model due to boundary effects .",
    "the difference between the sums @xmath15 ( with finite @xmath18 , which is the side of the cube ) and the so - called watson s integral ( for bulk ) @xmath19 with @xmath20 for @xmath13 , describes the finite - size effects for the pbc case @xcite and boundary effects in the fbc case @xcite .",
    "indeed , we have @xcite @xmath21    therefore , fig .",
    "[ sef_del ] shows that the coefficient in the linear-@xmath22 term in eq .",
    "( [ mlowth0 ] ) is smaller than in the bulk for the pbc system and greater for the fbc system .",
    "consequently , this means that the boundary effects suppress the magnetization while finite - size effects enhance it .",
    "moreover , fig .",
    "[ sef_del ] also shows that boundary effects render a larger contribution than finite - size effects , making the net magnetization below that of the bulk .",
    "surface effects are due to the breaking of crystal - field symmetry at the boundary of the nanoparticle , and in reality they can not be separated from boundary effects . in order to study such effects",
    "one has to resort to microscopic theories , unlike the macroscopic sw model @xcite , capable of distinguishing between different atomic environments and taking account of physical parameters such as single - site surface anisotropy , exchange and ddi , in addition of course to the magneto - crystalline anisotropy in the core and magnetic field .",
    "unfortunately , this leads to difficult many - body problems which can only be efficiently dealt with , in general , using numerical approaches .",
    "in this section we will summarize some of the main results obtained so far .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic particle of @xmath8 spins cut from a cube of side @xmath18 ( i.e. , @xmath23 atomic spacings ) with a given lattice structure .",
    "due to the underlying ( discrete ) lattice structure , the particle thus obtained is not a sphere with smooth boundary because its outer shell presents apices , steps , and facets , resulting in many sites with different coordination numbers .",
    "the model hamiltonian we use is the ( classical ) anisotropic dirac - heisenberg model  @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the unit spin vector on site @xmath26 , @xmath27 the uniform magnetic field , @xmath8 the total number of spins ( core and surface ) , and @xmath28 the nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic exchange coupling .",
    "@xmath29 is the uniaxial single - site anisotropy energy @xmath30 with easy axis @xmath31 and constant @xmath32 .",
    "if the spin at site @xmath26 is in the core , the anisotropy axis @xmath31 is taken along the reference @xmath33 axis and @xmath34 . for surface spins , this axis is along the radial ( i.e. , transverse to the cluster surface ) direction and @xmath35 . in this case , the model in ( [ uaa ] ) for surface spins is called the tsa model introduced earlier .",
    "we use the more general model of transverse direction given by the gradient [ the vector perpendicular to the isotimic surface @xmath36 defining the shape of the particle , e.g. a sphere or an ellipsoid ] . in the case of a spherical particle",
    "the transverse and radial directions coincide , whereas for another geometry such as an ellipsoid they do not .",
    "a more physically appealing microscopic model of surface anisotropy was introduced by nel @xcite with @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the coordination number of site @xmath26 and @xmath39 is the unit vector connecting the site @xmath26 to its nearest neighbors @xmath40 .",
    "this model is more realistic since the anisotropy at a given site occurs only when the latter loses some of its neighbors , i.e. , when it is located on the boundary . the model in ( [ nsa ] ) is referred to as the nel surface anisotropy ( nsa ) model @xcite .",
    "qualitatively , the nsa model is not quite different from the tsa model .",
    "for example , consider a site @xmath26 sitting on a @xmath41 $ ] facet , e.g. in the upper most plane normal to the @xmath33 axis .",
    "it has @xmath42 neighbors on that facet and one below it along the @xmath33 axis . from ( [ nsa ] ) ,",
    "the corresponding energy reads @xcite    @xmath43 \\\\ & = & k_s\\left[2s_{i , x}^{2 } + 2s_{i , y}^{2 } + s_{i , z}^{2}\\right ]   = 2 k_s - k_s\\,s_{i , z}^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that if @xmath45 the easy direction is along @xmath46 , i.e. , normal to the facet , and if @xmath47 the facet becomes an easy plane .",
    "therefore , upon dropping the irrelevant constant , we rewrite the above energy as @xmath48 which is the same as the tsa in eq .",
    "( [ uaa ] ) for the site considered . more generally , averaging the nsa over a surface perpendicular to the direction @xmath49 leads to [ see eqs .",
    "( 6 , 7 ) in ref .  ]",
    "@xmath50 thus favoring among @xmath51 the direction closest to the surface normal .",
    "this explains the similarity between the results obtained with tsa and nsa .",
    "using the components @xmath52 , the atomic surface density reads @xcite @xmath53 and thereby we have the particular cases @xmath54 for comparison , taking account of the atomic surface density , the tsa model is described by @xmath55 and the whole effect comes from the atomic surface density .",
    "quantitatively , in the nsa model the effect is bigger , since for the surface cut perpendicular to the grand diagonal of the cubic lattice the anisotropy completely disappears , whereas in ( [ esperp ] ) the surface anisotropy is only reduced by the factor @xmath56 .      the static properties of magnetic nanoparticles as many - spin systems have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite using the classical heisenberg model involving the atomic spin , as the elementary building block , with continuous degrees of freedom . in these works we investigated the field , temperature , and spatial behavior of the net as well as the local magnetization .",
    "we adapted and applied the existing theoretical approaches , such as spin - wave theory , spherical model , monte carlo simulation , and numerical techniques to nano - scaled magnetic systems .",
    "in particular , we studied the magnetic structure and found new switching mechanisms of the particle endowed with surface anisotropy .",
    "it was possible to estimate and compare finite - size , boundary , and surface effects , and to show that the latter two effects are of long - range and progressive , and that surface effects induce non - saturation of the magnetization , as observed in experiments @xcite . in the particular ( and typical ) situation where the exchange interaction is much stronger than the anisotropy energy we found that the magnetization can be represented as the spatially homogeneous",
    " global \" magnetization plus a small inhomogeneous contribution that we calculated analytically and numerically @xcite .",
    "the latter is induced by surface anisotropy and it is maximal near the surface but can extend deeply into the body of the particle .",
    "it describes the adjustment of the magnetization to the conditions at the surface by minimizing the total energy with fixed direction of the global magnetization . as a result we obtained",
    "the effective particle s energy that depends on the orientation of its net magnetization and arises because of surface anisotropy .",
    "this contribution is of second order in the surface anisotropy and it adds to other terms , such as the bulk anisotropy and the first - order contribution from the surface anisotropy , which disappear in samples of cubic or spherical shape .",
    "these contributions to the energy of a magnetic nanoparticle are crucial to its dynamical behavior , in particular , in the ferromagnetic resonance ( fmr ) . accurately taking all of them into account",
    "should make it possible to determine the bulk and surface anisotropies from the experimental data .",
    "an interesting problem is the dynamical aspect of the magnetization adjustment mentioned above .",
    "if the anisotropies are much smaller than exchange interaction , the exchange - driven adjustment is much faster than the global precession of the magnetization induced by the anisotropy .",
    "then , these adjustment modes behave adiabatically at low frequencies and the effective osp energy is a good approximation . for materials with a very strong surface anisotropy such separation of dynamical scales is no longer valid , and the dynamics of such nanoparticles becomes an essentially many - body process .",
    "fmr experiments on magnetic nanoparticles should allow to estimate the values of the surface anisotropy and detect different regimes of their dynamical behavior .",
    "let us now review with data plots a few typical results obtained for an msp particle with core and surface anisotropies , together with intra - exchange interactions and magnetic field . at zero temperature , in refs .",
    "we studied the magnetic state and switching mechanisms of model particles of spherical shape , sc lattice , uniaxial anisotropy in the core and both tsa and nsa , by varying the size , the exchange couplings , surface anisotropy intensity , and the field direction .",
    "the main result of this work is that varying the surface anisotropy one observes a crossover from i ) the coherent - reversal regime , as obtained by representing the particle as a macrospin according to the models of sw ( for statics ) and nb ( for dynamics ) , into ii ) the incoherent - reversal regime with cluster - wise switching . in the latter regime ,",
    "the particle exhibits ( due to strong surface anisotropy ) new features that are reminiscent of a many - spin system and which can not be described by a macroscopic approach . fig .",

    "the field is applied at an angle @xmath60 with respect to the core easy axis .",
    "these results show that as the surface anisotropy constant increases , one starts to observe steps in the hysteresis loop corresponding to the successive switching of spin clusters , defined as the groups of spins whose anisotropy axes make the same angle with the field direction .",

    "we investigated , in a somewhat phenomenological way , the effect of varying the ratio of the exchange coupling at the surface to that in the core in maghemite particles .",
    "the idea was to model the influence of the matrix in which the particles are embedded .",
    "the exchange coupling at the surface is meant to be an effective coupling resulting from the various chemical and physical interactions between the matrix and the particles . using the monte carlo technique we computed the thermal variation of the surface magnetisation as a function of the ( reduced ) temperature for a ratio of the exchange coupling at the surface to that in the core @xmath74 and for a surface contribution of @xmath75 .",
    "we found that the surface critical region is shifted to higher temperatures upon increasing @xmath76 , and only when @xmath77 do both the core and surface magnetic phase transitions occur in the same temperature range .",
    "the results also showed that the weaker is the exchange interactions on the surface the lower is the magnetisation of the latter .",
    "this result remains the same upon decreasing the outer shell thickness . in this case the number of spins having smaller coordination numbers than in the core , and hence weaker effective exchange energy , i.e. , those spins on the outer shell of the particle , is very small as compared to the rest of spins in the particle .",

    "@xmath256 can be calculated by postulating that at a given temperature and given measuring time , certain particles are in the superparamagnetic state and that the others are in the blocked state .",
    "the susceptibility is then given by the sum of the two contributions @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the  critical volume \" defined as the volume that discriminates between superparamagnetic particles of volume @xmath261 and blocked particles with @xmath262 , and is experiment - dependent . equation ( [ susc5 ] )",

    "we compute the contribution of ddi to @xmath264 and @xmath265 and use the relaxation rate in ( [ ddirr ] ) to compute the ddi contribution to @xmath267 .",

    "we observe that indeed the effect of ddi is to change @xmath203 from a bell - like curve with a maximum to a monotonic decreasing function , and this compares well with the experimental results [ see fig . 1 of ref .  ] . as was stressed in ref .",
    "the effect of ddi is not only to change the potential energyscape , as was argued in many previous publications @xcite , but also to introduce a transverse field that induces saddle points in the potential @xcite .",
    "this in turn makes the relaxation rate quite sensitive to the damping strength , and for low damping , as is the case in fig .",
    "[ tmaxh_maghemite5nm_delta1p1_ddi ] ( @xmath271 ) , the probability of switching increases . then , if a magnetic field is added with increasing intensity the energy barrier is lowered and the magnetic moments switch at lower temperatures .      in this last section we briefly comment on some recent ( raw ) results of the monte carlo calculations of the magnetization of a polydisperse assembly of msp nanoparticles as dealt with in section [ intrinsic ] .",
    "so far we have only considered non - interacting assemblies , and the work on the effect of ddi is still in progress .    in fig .",

    "the particles in the assembly of @xmath273 spins are smaller .",
    "these preliminary results show that the magnetization of the assembly with smaller particles requires higher fields to saturate even at very low temperature , as can be seen by comparing the two upper curves for @xmath72 which corresponds to @xmath275 k. as the temperature increases the spin disorder caused by the boundary and surface effects becomes stronger leading to a decrease of the magnetization [ see the curve at @xmath276 . ]",
    "contrary to the introduction , the conclusion is kept rather short .",
    "we will limit ourselves to emphasizing the unresolved issues owing to the complexities inherent to the systems under study , to the lack of sufficient experimental information , and to the deficiencies of the actual models .",
    "nonetheless , we may confort ourselves saying that so far within the framework of the present models we have achieved a fair understanding of the static properties of nanomagnets , namely the spatial distribution of the magnetization and its switching mechanisms . in particular , it becomes clearer , to both experimentalists and theorists , that the many - spin aspect of the nanomagnets is a prerequisite for a better understanding of their properties when their size is reduced towards the nanometer .",
    "we believe that the work done so far by many authors has set the pace to future faster developments towards mastering and controlling the novel extraordinary features of nanomagnets in view of efficient and practical technological applications . from the viewpoint of fundamental physics the facts established so far constitute a stepstone towards ever richer areas with more challenges to come .",
    "however , a great deal of work and endeavor still lies ahead of us because our actual knowledge of the subject is still plagued with quite a few obscure areas owing to the lack of sufficient pertinent information .",
    "this of course prevents us today from building a complete picture of the puzzle and makes our approach rather approximate .",
    "information is gained by experimental investigation along with theoretical predictions and attempts of interpretation . at present ,",
    "the theoretical models developed so far present a few deficiencies .",
    "for instance , it is commonly assumed that the crystal structure on the surface is the same as in the core with the same atomic lattice parameters .",
    "this can not be wholly true considering the possibility of surface reconstructions .",
    "of course , some models , including those presented here , do include apices , edges and facets , and the possibility of taking the exchange coupling on the surface as different from that in the core , or that between the core and the surface",
    ". however , there is no guarantee that it will become experimentally possible in the near future to estimate the atomic positions and lattice parameters and may be theoretically possible to perform crystal field calculations , and eventually check these assumptions .",
    "the magneto - crystalline anisotropy constant and exchange coupling in the core are also taken as those in the bulk underlying material .",
    "however , we have shown that the core of a nanoparticle does not enjoy the properties of the underlying bulk material .",
    "for a given material such parameters could vary with the radius of the particle .",
    "in addition , the intensity and nature of surface anisotropy constitute a real challenge .",
    "there are many estimates but no firm understanding is achieved yet as to how surface anisotropy stems from the atomic structure in nanoparticles of reasonable size . for these interrogations to receive answers experimentalists will have to devise ever more sensitive equipments and measurement techniques in order to probe the intrinsic properties of nanomagnets and have direct access to the related physical observables .",
    "this , of course , will require new strategies for further isolating the nanomagnets and rid them off the influence of their hosting matrices and mutual interactions .",
    "on the other hand , understanding the influence on the particles static and dynamic behavior of the surrounding matrix and the inter - particle interactions , is of paramount importance to efficient practical applications ."
