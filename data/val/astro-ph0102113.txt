    "the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) of a galaxy is the relative number of its globular clusters per luminosity ( or magnitude ) interval .",
    "it is usually unimodal and nearly symmetric with a peak at a characteristic ( turn  over ) magnitude .",
    "empirically it was found that turn  over magnitudes for galaxies at the same distance ( e.g.  in the same galaxy cluster ) differ by @xmath8 , which makes the gclf a good standard candle ( harris  @xcite ; jacoby _ et al . _",
    "however , the full calibration of the gclf is incomplete .",
    "the essential problem is that the galaxies at large distances , for which the gclf method is mostly used , are giant ellipticals in which globular clusters are found in largest numbers and in which there are usually fewer problems with extinction , whilst the primary calibration of the standard candle @xmath9 rests on the mw and m31 , which are spiral galaxies .",
    "in fact , evidence that gclfs depend on hubble type and environment has been claimed ( fleming _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , but the former is probably due to differences in mean metallicity of the globular clusters and the latter was never reliably demonstrated ( kissler - patig @xcite ) .",
    "there is strong observational evidence that most luminous giant ellipticals have a bimodal globular cluster metallicity distribution ( gebhardt & kissler - patig @xcite ; kundu @xcite ) .",
    "the globular cluster specific frequencies ( the number of clusters normalized to the galaxy luminosity ; harris & van den bergh @xcite ) are typically higher in ellipticals than in spirals ( harris @xcite ) . to explain the high number of globular clusters and the presence of several populations indicated by the bimodal metallicity distributions ,",

    "on the basis of the near ir colors for a magnitude  limited sample of 12 globular clusters , frogel  ( @xcite ) found one third of the sample to be super metal rich ( above solar metallicity ) and luminous .",

    "however , it is comforting to see that almost all the objects are concentrated towards the isochrones in excess of 1 gyr .",
    "this is additional evidence that they are indeed globular clusters .",
    "a spread of metallicities of more than 1.5 dex is also evident .    in fig .",
    "[ uvk ] most of the clusters lie slightly to the right and below the model lines .",
    "there are two possible explanations .",
    "first , a difference with the ssp models , particularly significant in u - v and b - v colors , has already been pointed out by barmby & huchra ( @xcite ) .",
    "they suggested u fluxes from the stellar libraries , systematic problems with modeling hb color and observational errors as possible causes of this offset .",
    "second , in the data presented here additional offset may arise from the difference between the bessel and johnson u - band transmission curves ( bessel @xcite ) .",

    "[ lfmag ] .",
    "the actual shape of the luminosity function depends on the size of the bins and on the bin - centers .",

    "[ kolmogorov ] the cumulative distribution functions for the three gclfs are shown .",
    "the thick line is used for ngc  5128 , thin line for the mw and dotted line for m31 .",
    "absolute magnitudes for ngc  5128 globular clusters were calculated using the distance modulus value of ( m@xmath4m@xmath34 ( soria _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) and reddening value of e(b@xmath4v@xmath31 .",
    "the ks statistic measures the maximum value of the absolute difference between two cumulative distribution functions from which a probability that the two distributions are drawn from a common distribution can be calculated .",
    "the probability that the gclf of ngc  5128 matches the one of the mw is 89% , comparable to the probability that m31 gclf matches the mw one ( 85% ) .",
    "the difference is slightly bigger in the u - band distributions ( fig .",
    "[ kolmogorov ] right panel ) , but it is also probable that the three luminosity functions are essentially similar for the three galaxies .",
    "i conclude that the ngc  5128 gclf is as similar ( or as different ) to the mw gclf as the m31 one .",
    "usually the gclf is fitted with a gaussian or @xmath35 distribution function in order to determine its peak magnitude .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the reasonably complete luminosity functions are known only for the two spiral galaxies , the mw and m31 .",
    "both of these gclfs appear to depart from the gaussian distribution ( ashman _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , while there is no complete gclf for any elliptical galaxy .",
    "the dependence of the turn  over magnitude on the detection of the faint end of gclf is discussed in ashman _",
    "et al . _  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the determination of the turn  over magnitude for ngc  5128 is left for a subsequent paper where the complete analysis of wfi data is going to be presented .",
    "the detection of the faint end of the gclf in an elliptical galaxy is also important from the dynamical point of view .",
    "the faint globular clusters are typically also the less massive ones and their presence in the deep potential of a giant elliptical puts strong constraints on the potential itself as well as on the effects of tidal forces in the halo . unfortunately the faintest globular clusters , corresponding to the mw pal  1 , am  4 , terzan  1 , pal  13 are probably not detectable on fors1 images ( see sect .",
    "[ completenesstest ] ) .",
    "the processes that destroy globular clusters can be divided into internal , like two - body relaxation and mass loss during stellar evolution , and external .",
    "the external processes depend greatly on environment and therefore on the position of the clusters in the galaxy .",
    "while tidal shocks preferentially destroy less dense clusters , dynamical friction brings more massive clusters very close to galactic centre .",
    "both of these external processes are much stronger in the inner part of the galaxy . according to theoretical simulations",
    "( vesperini  @xcite , ostriker & gnedin @xcite ) in a galaxy like ngc  5128 , with the total mass of @xmath36 m@xmath37 ( israel  @xcite ) and r@xmath38 kpc ( dufour _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) , a strong disruption and mass loss are efficient only within a galactocentric distance of @xmath39 r@xmath40 , while at larger radii most of the mass loss is due to effects of stellar evolution .",
    "field  1 is located at @xmath41 r@xmath40 and field  2 at @xmath42 r@xmath40 . while the dynamical effects may still be important for field  2 clusters , they are probably completely negligible for clusters in the outer field .",
    "it is not possible to quantify these effects by simple comparison of the two subsamples , because of the small number statistics .",
    "the ( u@xmath4v)@xmath5 color histogram for 71 globular clusters in ngc  5128 indicates a bimodal distribution ( fig .",
    "[ lfcolor ] ) . note that the ( u@xmath4v)@xmath5 color distribution of the mw globular clusters does not show bimodality while the one of m31 does .",
    "the ( u@xmath4v)@xmath5 color distribution of the mw globular clusters is in fact biased due to lack of u - magnitude and higher reddening values ( only clusters with e(b@xmath4v@xmath43 are plotted ) of bulge ( more metal - rich and redder ) cluster .",
    "the blue peaks of the mw , m31 and ngc  5128 globular cluster color distributions coincide .",
    "the blue cutoff in the three galaxies is quite sharp and is driven principally by the colors of blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "the red side of the color distribution is much broader . in m31",
    "it can be partially driven by differential reddening inside the host spiral galaxy , because the colors for m31 clusters presented here were corrected only for the mean foreground reddening of e(b@xmath4v)=0.08 .",
    "examination of the stellar ( u@xmath4v ) _ vs. _  ( v@xmath4k ) diagram in the two fields in ngc  5128 indicates that the amount of reddening does not vary much in the halo of this giant elliptical ( rejkuba _ et al . _",

    "the differences in the color ( metallicity ) distribution of clusters and stars in the halo of a spiral , like mw and a ge like ngc 5128 , are reflected in figure 10 with a much larger metallicity spread in ge galaxy .",
    "the line overplotted on the color distribution of ngc  5128 is the best nonparametric kernel estimate ( silverman @xcite ) of the color distribution used to measure accurately the blue and the red peaks of the distribution .",
    "the blue and red peaks are measured at ( u@xmath4v)@xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .    from the color - color diagram ( fig .",

    "assuming that the globular clusters in ngc  5128 have similar ages as the mw ones , one can use the galactic globular clusters to calibrate the metallicity scale .",
    "it is known that for the very low and very high metallicities the color - metallicity relation can not be expressed by a simple linear function , but extrapolation from lower metallicities towards the higher ones by using the higher polynomial fit might lead to unphysical results .",
