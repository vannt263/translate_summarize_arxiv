    "it is now generally assumed that electron - positron pair creation immediately above the magnetic poles is essential for coherent radio emission in pulsars .",
    "muslimov & tsygan ( 1992 ) have made an important contribution in their recognition of the significance of the lense - thirring effect in the generation of adequately strong electric fields ( see also the paper of muslimov & harding 1997 ) .",
    "it is remarkable , and must be almost unique , that a general - relativistic effect changes the order of magnitude of a field component in a system that can be described , ostensibly , perfectly well in euclidean space as in the paper of goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) .",
    "at least initially , finding the acceleration field @xmath3 which is the component locally parallel with the magnetic flux density @xmath4 , can be regarded as a problem in electrostatics within a volume in the corotating frame of reference having well - defined boundary conditions .",
    "this is defined by the neutron - star surface and the surface separating open from closed magnetic flux lines and is assumed to have the electric potential boundary condition @xmath5 .",
    "it is possible that this surface is actually a current sheet of some complexity ( see , for example , arons 2010 ) , but we shall assume that , near the neutron - star surface , the time - dependence of @xmath3 within it is not sufficiently rapid to hinder the charge movement necessary to maintain the boundary condition .",
    "thus there are three possible cases depending , firstly , on the relation between rotation spin @xmath6 and @xmath4 and hence the sign of the polar - cap goldreich - julian charge density @xmath7 , and secondly on the neutron - star surface value of @xmath3 .",
    "they are : ( i ) @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 with electron acceleration ; ( ii ) @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 with positron and positive baryon acceleration or ( iii ) @xmath13 , @xmath12 and @xmath14 . throughout this paper , for brevity",
    ", these conditions will be referred to as cases ( i ) , ( ii ) or ( iii ) .",
    "there is no further possible case because free emission of electrons is always possible at neutron - star surface temperatures . a previous paper ( jones 2010a , hereafter paper i ) reported some preliminary work on the relation between these sets of boundary conditions and observed phenomena , in particular , the existence of pulse nulls in a significant fraction of radio pulsars .",
    "there seems to be no reason why neutron stars satisfying ( i ) , ( ii ) and even exceptionally ( iii ) should not exist and it is the purpose of the present paper to continue the attempt to see if features of the predicted plasma acceleration in these cases correlate with observed properties of subsets of the pulsar population .",
    "there can be little doubt that in this context nulls and subpulse drift are important phenomena .",
    "although there must be reservations about assigning undue weight to the properties of a single neutron star , nulls in the isolated pulsar psr b1931 + 24 are informative .",
    "kramer et al ( 2006 ) found that spin - down in the on - state is approximately twice as fast as in the off - state .",
    "it is difficult to see , in a pulsar of this age ( @xmath15 yr ) , how the geometrical shape of the acceleration volume or the magnitude of the current density @xmath16 within it can change by a factor of this order in less than the rotation period @xmath17 .",
    "time - varying fields near the light cylinder can further accelerate ultra - relativistic particles of both signs and therefore the most obvious explanation for the change in spin - down torque is that the particle and field components of the magnetospheric momentum density and stress tensor near the light cylinder differ between on and off - states . a cessation of pair creation during nulls would greatly change the charged particle number density even though @xmath16 remains essentially unchanged . in this connection , it is interesting that a recent paper by lyne et al ( 2010 ) suggests quasi - periodic switching between two different spin - down rates as the origin of the peculiar timing residuals seen in many pulsars .",
    "the presence of nulls might be thought of as evidence that a pulsar is in the final phase of evolution prior to complete cessation of radio emission .",
    "however , we suggest that this view is not consistent with a specific feature of the 63 nulling pulsars listed in tables 1 and 2 of the paper by wang , manchester & johnston ( 2007 ) . the maximum potential difference @xmath18 available for acceleration at the polar cap is proportional to @xmath19 , in which @xmath20 is the effective dipole field inferred from the spin - down rate .",
    "it is approximately independent of the ratio of @xmath20 to the actual polar - cap field @xmath21 .",
    "the distribution of this quantity for all radio pulsars in the atnf catalogue ( manchester et al 2005 ) has a relatively sharp cut - off at @xmath22 g s@xmath23 , equivalent to the existence of a well - defined death line in the distribution of @xmath20 versus @xmath17 .",
    "it might be expected that nulls should be seen only as a pulsar rotation slows so that it approaches this value .",
    "but the form of the distribution of @xmath19 for the nulling pulsars listed by wang et al is broadly indistinguishable from that of the whole atnf catalogue and instead is consistent with nulls being a long - term property of a certain sub - set of radio pulsars .",
    "it is , of course just possible that the observed sharp cut - off is itself a statistical fluctuation and that individual pulsar deaths actually occur at values of @xmath19 throughout the whole distribution because some other variable is involved , such as flux - line curvature .",
    "but we shall discount this possibility and in the present paper adopt the view that pulsars with boundary condition ( ii ) and , exceptionally , ( iii ) form the sub - set that null .",
    "a recent large - scale survey by weltevrede , edwards & stappers ( 2006 ) has revealed that subpulse drift is a common phenomenon . under the assumption that electron - positron pairs are the source of the coherent radio emission",
    ", it implies that compact zones of pair creation exist and move in an organized way within the open magnetosphere area of the polar cap .",
    "this motion has been assumed to be an @xmath24 drift velocity under the case ( iii ) surface electric field boundary condition , following the original paper of ruderman & sutherland ( 1975 ) .",
    "there have been many later papers on this subject and we refer to gil , melikidze & geppert ( 2003 ) for recent developments which have sought to refine the calculation of the drift velocity .",
    "the problem is that the case ( iii ) boundary condition is implausible as a common property of the pulsar population and that cases ( i ) and ( ii ) have not hitherto provided any immediate and obvious basis for the formation of organized subpulses .",
    "it was shown in paper i that short time - scale instability in the composition of accelerated plasma exists in case ( ii ) . in this paper , it is shown to be a plausible mechanism for subpulse formation and drift .    under the assumption of an actual dipole field , pair creation is possible , in principle , in all observed pulsars through the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) of polar - cap photons by accelerated electrons or positrons ( hibschman & arons 2001 , also see fig . 1 of harding & muslimov 2002 ) , but",
    "curvature radiation ( cr ) can produce pairs only in those with high values of @xmath19 . however , there is a problem , noted by harding & muslimov , in the formation of a dense pair plasma because the number of ics pairs formed per primary electron or positron accelerated can be smaller than unity ( see also fig . 8 of hibschman & arons ) .",
    "they suggest that the pair density required for coherent radio emission may be far smaller than previously thought . although higher multipole field components may be present in most pulsars , so increasing flux - line curvature , the existence of this problem must remain a matter of concern perhaps even leading to doubts about the role of pair plasma as the source of coherent radio emission .    the existence of solutions of the electrostatic problem under boundary conditions ( ii ) or ( iii ) is no more than a preliminary because we are concerned in this paper with the presence of instabilities which arise from the reverse electron flow at the polar cap .",
    "it might be questioned whether or not the charge density on the surface separating open from closed magnetic flux - lines needed for the condition @xmath25 can be maintained in the presence of instability .",
    "but we shall find that , even at short time - scales , instability principally changes the nature of the particles accelerated rather than the current density @xmath16 and the acceleration field .",
    "the instabilities considered here are not , of course , a feature of case ( i ) in which electrons are the primary component of @xmath16 .",
    "establishing instability in this case is a purely electromagnetic problem which has been considered by levinson et al ( 2005 ) , melrose & luo ( 2009 ) and reville & kirk ( 2010 ) .",
    "non - stationary flow in case ( iii ) has been investigated by timokhin ( 2010 ) .",
    "the properties of the condensed matter surface are naturally important in cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) , in particular , the production of protons by the reverse flux of electrons described previously ( paper i ; see also jones 1981 ) .",
    "this is a characteristic of electromagnetic showers that is usually of little practical significance .",
    "the form of the shower depends principally on electron - photon interactions but shower photons also interact directly with nuclei .",
    "the cross - section is a maximum with the excitation of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) , a broad collective state , at a photon momentum @xmath26 mc .",
    "( electroproduction cross - sections are smaller by a factor of the order of the fine - structure constant and can be neglected . )",
    "photon track length per unit interval of @xmath27 in a high - energy shower is @xmath28 so that to a good approximation , photoproduction of baryons can be assumed to occur entirely through gdr formation .",
    "known cross - sections and electromagnetic shower theory allow the calculation of production rates , and we define @xmath29 as the number of protons produced per unit primary shower energy .",
    "protons are initially of the order of a few mev but are very rapidly moderated to thermal energies without further strong interaction , and then diffuse to the surface with a time delay that is of prime significance for the stability of plasma acceleration . for further details",
    "we refer to paper i , also to jones ( 2010b ) for the cross - sections at high values of @xmath21 for processes of second order in electron - photon coupling . in the early stages of acceleration ,",
    "partially - ionized atoms interact with the polar - cap blackbody radiation field and this is the source of the reverse - electron flux that is considered here .",
    "it has proved convenient to combine rates for this process with values of @xmath29 by defining , for a particular pulsar , the parameter @xmath30 which is equal to the number of protons produced per unit nuclear charge accelerated .",
    "instabilities in solutions of the time - independent electrostatic problem referred to above exist as a consequence of proton formation and we propose that they are the basis for the nulling phenomenon and for subpulse formation and drift .",
    "the complexity that arises is unfortunate because it limits what can be achieved in terms of a physical theory of the acceleration process .",
    "thus we shall be able to expose the general properties attaching to cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) but are not always able to give quantitative predictions .",
    "we shall show in section 2 that general consideration of polar - cap parameters rule out the possibility that the relatively numerous subsets of pulsars that exhibit nulls and subpulse drift belong to case ( iii ) .",
    "therefore , sections 3 and 4 of this paper are restricted to further consideration of case ( ii ) for which short time - scale instability in plasma acceleration has been described previously in paper i. its properties are summarized in section 3 .",
    "the previous treatment of medium time - scales was , however , inadequate and contained an error .",
    "the appropriate analysis is given here in section 4 .",
    "the relations between these instabilities and the observed properties of nulls and of subpulse drift are described in section 5 and , in particular , the relation beween the subpulse band separation periodicity @xmath1 and proton diffusion time is given .",
    "many of the polar - cap properties and parameters that will be required for the arguments of sections 3 - 5 have been given previously in paper i. the properties of the polar cap atmosphere are of particular importance and will be further considered in section 3 .",
    "but it will be convenient to summarize the remainder here with some additions .",
    "the most basic parameter is the ion number density @xmath31 of the condensed matter at zero pressure .",
    "the magnetic dipole fields @xmath20 inferred from pulsar spin - down rates vary over about five orders of magnitude , but the median value for the 63 nulling pulsars listed by wang et al is @xmath32 g , which is significantly larger than for the whole atnf catalogue .",
    "it is also possible that the actual polar - cap field @xmath21 is larger than @xmath20 . for these reasons ,",
    "we adopt the expression , @xmath33 fitted to values computed by medin & lai ( 2006 ) , primarily for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the magnetic flux density in units of @xmath36 g and @xmath37 is the atomic number .",
    "the convenient unit of depth below the surface at @xmath38 is the radiation length , @xmath39 defined here in terms of the zero - field bethe - heitler bremsstrahlung cross - section with screening factor modified for the neutron - star surface density ( see paper i ) .",
    "the critical temperature above which the ion thermal emission rate is high enough to maintain the case ( ii ) boundary condition is related to the cohesive energy @xmath40 by @xmath41 ( see the discussion of atmospheric properties in section 3 ) .",
    "cohesive energies have been calculated by medin & lai as functions of @xmath21 . for @xmath42 and @xmath43 ,",
    "their value is in good agreement with that obtained by jones ( 1985 ) using a different representation of the three - dimensional condensed matter state . in the interval @xmath44 ,",
    "their values can be fitted by the expressions @xmath45 kev for @xmath46 and @xmath47 kev for @xmath42 giving , @xmath48 these are to be seen in relation to other temperatures that are significant .",
    "paper i contained a calculation of the rate of proton formation in the electromagnetic showers formed by reverse electrons incident on the polar cap . from the energy flux needed to produce a proton current density @xmath49 , we can infer a maximum steady - state polar - cap temperature , @xmath50 in this expression , @xmath29 is the number of protons produced per unit primary shower energy .",
    "we can approximate it initially by @xmath51 which was obtained in paper i by using the zero - field bethe - heitler pair creation cross - section with screening modified for the condensed matter density at the neutron - star surface .",
    "its values , given in table 1 of that paper , can be summarized conveniently in the intervals @xmath52 and @xmath53 by the expression @xmath54 in which the nuclear charge is the average in the region of the shower maximum .",
    "the angle @xmath55 is that between @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "the general - relativistic correction contained in the surface value of the goldreich- julian charge density @xmath7 is @xmath56 ( see muslimov & harding 1997 ) , and @xmath57 is stefan s constant . equation ( 4 ) also contains a further temperature , @xmath58 , which is the polar - cap temperature in the absence of any reverse electron or photon energy flux ( approximately the observed whole - surface temperature corrected to the local proper frame ) .",
    "the presence of @xmath58 assumes that there is a constant heat flow to the surface driven by the very much higher temperature of the inner crust . with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we find , @xmath61 equating this with @xmath62 allows us to estimate the minimum polar - cap magnetic flux densities necessary to sustain the case ( iii ) boundary condition @xmath63 .",
    "these are , @xmath64 comparison with the median value of @xmath65 for the 63 nulling pulsars listed by wang et al shows that case ( iii ) can be widely realized only with implausibly large deviations from a central dipole field .",
    ".the table gives values of @xmath29 for high magnetic flux densities @xmath66 and nuclear charge @xmath37 .",
    "the effective total cross - sections @xmath67 for pair creation in the gdr photon energy band are for transverse momenta below the lowest magnetic conversion threshold at @xmath68 mc and are in units of barns .",
    "they are estimates obtained from table 3 of jones ( 2010b ) by averaging over photon polarization and over photon transverse momenta @xmath69 and @xmath70 mc , and are equivalent to a mean free path for coulomb pair creation lengthened by a factor @xmath71 compared with that for the modified zero - field bethe - heitler cross - section .",
    "the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal effect is not significant in the gdr photon energy band [ cols=\">,^,^,^ , > \" , ]     however , the screening - modified zero - field bethe - heitler pair creation cross - section is not obviously valid at magnetic flux densities of the order of the critical field @xmath72 g. thus we have been obliged to calculate the second - order bremsstrahlung and pair creation cross - sections using landau function solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "the photoproduction of protons by giant - dipole resonance ( gdr ) decay is determined by the total photon track length in the gdr band , centred on a momentum @xmath73 mc , which occurs almost entirely in the late stages of shower development .",
    "the track length at these energies is limited by coulomb and magnetic pair creation , also by compton scattering the effect of which is almost always to scatter the photon so that its transverse momentum component @xmath74 ( perpendicular to the field ) exceeds the threshold for magnetic conversion to electron - positron pairs .",
    "we refer to sections 2 and 3 of paper i for a more detailed description of these processes .",
    "approximate values of the coulomb pair creation cross - section at magnetic fields @xmath75 are given in table 3 of jones ( 2010b ) and are the basis for the values of @xmath29 given here in table 1 .",
    "these are not easily summarized as a simple expression analogous with equation ( 5 ) .",
    "the cross - section at @xmath76 is at least an order of magnitude smaller the the modified zero - field bethe - heitler cross - section but the effect on @xmath29 is not large because the photon track length in this region is limited by compton scattering .",
    "substitution into equation ( 4 ) gives values of @xmath77 that typically are reduced by a factor of approximately @xmath78 from those of equation ( 6 ) .",
    "but the complexity of the second - order processes at @xmath79 is such that we have not reconsidered shower development and , specifically , have not allowed for the production by cyclotron emission or coulomb bremsstrahlung of photons with @xmath74 above the thresholds for magnetic conversion .",
    "this becomes significant at @xmath80 , as shown in tables 2 and 4 of jones ( 2010b ) , and the high magnetic conversion transition rates reduce gdr - band photon track length in the shower .",
    "the reduced @xmath29 values increase @xmath77 . owing to this complexity at @xmath79",
    "there are inevitable uncertainties in our estimates of @xmath29 , but we believe that they do not seriously invalidate the estimates of the minimum polar - cap magnetic flux densities needed to support the case ( iii ) boundary condition and our conclusion that it can exist only in a very small subset of pulsars .",
    "our conclusions drawn from equation ( 3 ) are also independent of the spectrum of the reverse electron - photon flux because @xmath29 is almost completely independent of primary shower energy provided that is large compared with the gdr energy .",
    "there appear to be no published estimates of the melting temperature of condensed matter that are specific to very high magnetic fields .",
    "consequently , we are obliged to adopt the standard one - component coulomb plasma expression ( see , for example , slattery , doolen & dewitt 1980 ) which , with equation ( 1 ) , gives , @xmath81 in terms of an effective valence charge @xmath82 .",
    "this latter parameter represents the fact that the deeply - bound landau states certainly do not participate significantly in the melting transition , but its estimation at higher values of @xmath37 is quite difficult .",
    "it is possible that the work of potekhin , chabrier & yakovlev ( 1997 ; see fig .",
    "1 ) could provide guidance although it is at zero field and was directed toward a different problem . on this basis , we assume for @xmath42 a value in the interval @xmath83 . in a typical polar - cap field ,",
    "@xmath43 , the melting temperature is as low as @xmath84 k for @xmath85 but exceeds @xmath86 k for @xmath87 .",
    "thus the state of the polar cap may be a sequence of melting and solidifications .",
    "the order of magnitude of the shear modulus is a further source of complexity .",
    "the standard ( zero - field ) expression for a body - centred cubic lattice ( fuchs 1936 ) can be adapted , with equation ( 1 ) , to give , @xmath88 however , the polar - cap gravitational constant is @xmath89 cm s@xmath23 so that any density inversion may well induce a form of rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "the final condensed - matter parameter that is important is the thermal conductivity parallel with @xmath4 , which is extremely high ( see potekhin 1999 ) .",
    "thermal energy is deposited at shower maxima a distance @xmath90 below the surface @xmath38 , which is defined as that separating condensed matter from the atmosphere , and is then dissipated as blackbody radiation from the polar cap .",
    "the value of @xmath90 in the high - density condensed matter of the neutron - star surface depends on shower energy owing to the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect but for the order of magnitude of the characteristic time we can assume @xmath91 cm using the radiation lengths @xmath92 given by equation ( 2 ) or in table 1 of paper i. the characteristic time for shower energy input to produce a surface - temperature fluctuation is then , @xmath93 in which typical values of the parameters are the specific heat @xmath94 erg @xmath95 k@xmath96 and the longitudinal coefficent of thermal conductivity @xmath97 erg cm@xmath96 s@xmath96 k@xmath96 . but for a surface temperature of @xmath86",
    "k , the internal temperature gradient needed to conduct the radiated energy flux is extremely small , of the order of @xmath99 k cm@xmath96 , within the condensed matter at @xmath100 . in effect , heat is more easily conducted to greater depths than radiated from the surface .",
    "consequently , the green function @xmath101 giving the internal temperature distribution must be almost independent of @xmath90 and very close to that for zero temperature gradient at the surface @xmath102 .",
    "thus a shower heat input @xmath103 produces a temperature distribution within the condensed matter at @xmath104 , @xmath105 it is asymptotically @xmath106 so that the polar - cap temperature arising from a sequence of heating events , each producing a maximum temperature @xmath77 , has fluctuations away from @xmath107 whose magnitude is a function of the time - scale concerned .",
    "further discussion of this is deferred until our consideration of observed polar - cap blackbody temperature in section 5 .",
    "under the assumption that the case ( ii ) boundary condition is satisfied , the neutron - star surface has an atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) with approximate scale height @xmath108 cm at temperature @xmath109 k , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the mean ion charge and mass of the partially ionized atom .",
    "the expression for the chemical potential of an ideal boltzmann gas gives the lte atmospheric number density at @xmath38 , @xmath112 for atmospheric temperatures such that @xmath113 .",
    "its order of magnitude is @xmath114 @xmath95 for @xmath115 .",
    "we estimate the critical temperature @xmath62 which must not be exceeded if the case ( iii ) boundary condition is to be valid by equating the flux of ions in such an lte atmosphere that are incident on the neutron - star surface with the ion flux needed to give an open magnetosphere current density equal to @xmath116 .",
    "this gives @xmath117 @xmath95 and @xmath118 .",
    "but the extent to which the atmosphere can be described as thin is very temperature - dependent .",
    "thus for @xmath119 and @xmath42 , @xmath120 is of the order of @xmath121 @xmath95 and the whole atmosphere contains ions equivalent to about @xmath122 . at a density @xmath123 @xmath95 , the boltzmann gas estimate of @xmath124 assumed here is unreliable and it becomes necessary to allow for the interaction of protons with the ion atmosphere .    if instabilities in plasma acceleration with time - scales as short as@xmath125 s are considered , the temperature at @xmath38 is constant apart from very small fluctuations , as shown by the green function given at the end of the previous section .",
    "consequently , the temperature distribution and number density of ions in the atmosphere are also constant in time and the atmosphere is in local thermodynamic equilibrium in the interval @xmath126 , where @xmath127 is the top of the ion atmosphere , defined as the surface of last scattering . for time - scales of the order of @xmath128 , the temperature and depth of the atmosphere can change appreciably but there is no doubt that it is always in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the processes of proton formation by gdr decay followed by diffusion to the surface were described in paper i , which assumed a very thin atmosphere .",
    "therefore , we need to consider here , in more detail , diffusion in the atmosphere @xmath126 .",
    "the number of protons is very many orders of magnitude smaller than that of ions so that the properties of the atmosphere , its scale height and equilibrium electric field given by the electrical neutrality condition , are determined solely by the latter . with the assumption of a single ion component",
    "we can determine the equilibrium electric field within the lte atmosphere in the presence of a gravitational acceleration @xmath129 and find that the proton potential energy is , @xmath130 for ions of charge @xmath110 and mass number @xmath131 , and that this transports protons to @xmath132 from which region they are accelerated to relativistic energies in preference to the ions .",
    "proton diffusion at a rate greater than is needed for a current density @xmath133 therefore cuts off ion acceleration and produces a thin electrically neutral proton atmosphere at @xmath132 .",
    "there appears to be no reason why this atmospheric structure should be disturbed by turbulent mixing",
    ".    the proton average potential energy at @xmath100 is close to @xmath134 but the jump bias , @xmath135 for ion separation @xmath136 , is too small to be significant because @xmath137 .",
    "the atmospheric proton density at @xmath38 is necessarily some orders of magnitude smaller than the density at @xmath100 owing to the density discontinuity at the surface .",
    "thus diffusion to the surface at @xmath38 is little changed by the presence of an atmosphere that is not necessarily very thin .",
    "movement of the protons through the ion atmosphere is effected by the chemical potential gradient which is a function of ion number density . at high densities , as in the solid at @xmath100 , this is determined principally by entropy but as the density reduces , the potential energy given by equation ( 12 ) becomes the more important factor . in effect",
    ", the motion changes from a random walk to a drift velocity .",
    "the dividing ion density is given by the condition @xmath138 and is @xmath139 @xmath95 , below which it is appropriate to define a drift velocity determined by the local value of the mean free path @xmath140 derived from the total cross - section for rutherford back - scattering , @xmath141 in which , @xmath142 the drift velocity is @xmath143 cm s@xmath96 at this density and @xmath144 .",
    "the consequence for a @xmath119 atmosphere is that the diffusion time to @xmath145 is increased , by some orders of magnitude , compared with the values assumed in paper i which were for diffusion through the condensed matter only .",
    "also , the change from random walk to drift velocity in the atmosphere has a significant effect on the distribution of diffusion times because it removes the long tail in the distribution that is a feature of random walks .",
    "some effort has been made here to confirm that there is outward proton diffusion because the process is of crucial importance .",
    "it was shown in paper i that plasma acceleration is unstable , consisting of alternate bursts of proton and ion acceleration , with time - scale determined by the time for proton diffusion from @xmath146 to @xmath147 .",
    "the polar - cap current density @xmath16 is essentially time - independent for relativistic flow ( as is the charge density ) so that there is no fluctuation in polar - cap electric field other than that arising from the reverse flow of photo - electrons from accelerated ions ( see section 5 ) .",
    "the instability is in the nature of the plasma accelerated and remains adequately described by the analysis given in paper i which will not be repeated here .",
    "the maximum acceleration potential difference , given a current density @xmath148 , is almost entirely dependent on the muslimov & tsygan ( 1992 ) general - relativistic correction .",
    "there is a separate contribution arising from ion inertia ( michel 1974 ) but it is important only at very low altitudes . neglecting this , the maximum potential difference is approximately @xmath149 and , unless restricted by pair creation at lower altitudes , is reached at an altitude @xmath150 of the order of the neutron - star radius @xmath151 which is roughly two orders larger than the polar - cap radius .",
    "we refer to harding & muslimov ( 2001 , 2002 ) for a complete account .",
    "we assume here that for this current density , spontaneous pair creation by curvature radiation is not possible .",
    "then the primary source of any positron component in @xmath16 can only be the reverse flow of photo - electrons from accelerated partially - ionized atoms as discussed in paper i. but there is an essential difference here in that protons in the very low density region at @xmath152 are almost completely ionized ( here , we refer to fig.1 of potekhin et al 2006 ) so that both track length and energy flux of reverse - flow electrons from photo - ionized hydrogen atoms are negligibly small .",
    "thus positron production in any interval of proton acceleration is negligible .",
    "this is also true for ions of low atomic number @xmath153 which are completely ionized , but for higher @xmath37 , the reverse flux of inward accelerated electrons produces polar - cap ics photons , as would outward accelerated electrons in case ( i ) .",
    "pairs are produced by photons that are scattered to transverse momenta above the magnetic conversion thresholds .",
    "the only difference is that the photons are inward moving .",
    "but even if spontaneous cr pair formation is not possible , positrons accelerated outward will produce cr pairs at higher altitudes , as in case ( i ) , though superimposed on a flux of ions .    in case ( i ) , the reverse flux of positrons must form protons which are not accelerated but form an atmosphere at @xmath154 whose equilibrium is defined by various diffusion processes perpendicular to the magnetic flux .",
    "backward moving photons from the electron or positron showers are a further source of pair creation in each of cases ( i ) - ( iii ) .",
    "these arise from the decay of residual nuclei following proton or neutron emission in gdr formation , and from @xmath155 reactions .",
    "those photons that are not absorbed in the more dense part of the atmosphere can produce pairs if their transverse momenta exceed the threshold .",
    "the lpm effect , which in the high - density condensed matter at @xmath156 is significant for electrons of more than @xmath157 gev or photons of more than @xmath158 gev , is less important in the atmosphere within which there will be some gdr formation .",
    "but we have been unable to make a satisfactory quantitative estimate of pair formation through this process .",
    "instability on time - scales some orders of magnitude longer than those of section 3 is also of interest and can appear as a fluctuation in the charge of nuclei reaching the polar - cap surface which we shall define here to be always at @xmath38 although it may move with respect to coordinates fixed at the centre of the star .",
    "ions of initial charge @xmath159 move upward through the region of the shower maxima at @xmath90 and , with nuclear charge reduced to @xmath160 by gdr formation and decay , enter the atmosphere at @xmath154 .",
    "we wish to find if there are conditions under which the local average nuclear charge @xmath161 fails to be a time - independent function of position with limits @xmath162 .",
    "the work of this section replaces that of section 4.1 in paper i which contains an error .",
    "the longer time - scales here enable us to assume the proton and ion current densities @xmath163 and @xmath164 are the time averages of those described in the previous section .",
    "there is , of course , a distribution of discrete nuclear charges in the shower region , but we shall work in terms of the average @xmath165 , the corresponding number density @xmath166 given by equation ( 1 ) , and the velocity @xmath167 with which nuclei approach the polar - cap surface at @xmath102 .",
    "proton formation by gdr decay occurs predominantly in the very late stages of shower development , as explained in section 1 , and so we shall assume that it is confined within limits @xmath168 and @xmath169 and is defined by the normalized function @xmath170 , @xmath171 the physical basis for our study of the system is that the total numbers of nuclei and of protons ( bound or unbound ) are conserved . because both neutrons and protons are produced in gdr decay , we can make the approximation of neglecting the effect of @xmath172-transitions .",
    "therefore , the continuity equations are , @xmath173 and with neglect of the relatively short proton diffusion time so that within medium time - scales all protons produced in the shower are assumed to be promptly accelerated from the atmosphere at @xmath174 , @xmath175 because the reverse electron flux from photo - electric ionization is the source of the showers , we shall find it convenient here , as in paper i , to introduce the parameter @xmath30 which is a function of the atmospheric nuclear charge and is the number of protons produced per unit positive nuclear charge accelerated . with the representation of equation ( 1 ) in the form @xmath176 , equations ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) can be combined to give , @xmath177 it has the obvious time - independent solution , @xmath178 and the time - independent velocity of nuclei is such that @xmath179 is independent of @xmath150 .",
    "a natural fluctuation away from @xmath180 would be of the form @xmath181 with , @xmath182 giving similar fluctuations in @xmath163 , @xmath31 and @xmath183 , in which @xmath184 is infinitesimal and independent of @xmath150 and @xmath185 . from equation",
    "( 17 ) we then have , @xmath186 where , @xmath187 substitution into equation ( 19 ) with the retention of terms of first order in @xmath184 gives , @xmath188 the current densities , averaged over short time - scales , are @xmath189 and , from the definition of @xmath30 , @xmath190 .",
    "the fluctuation away from the time - independent solution is @xmath191 , which we assume to be maintained by the boundary conditions on @xmath192 . to express @xmath193 in terms of @xmath194",
    "we represent the @xmath37-dependence of @xmath30 in the vicinity of @xmath160 as a power law @xmath195 .",
    "we find , after eliminating the velocity fluctuation @xmath196 , that @xmath197 the relationship with equation ( 24 ) is established by noting that , @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the time interval of nuclear movement from @xmath200 to @xmath102 . from equations ( 24 ) -",
    "( 26 ) , the equation whose root @xmath201 we require can be expressed as , @xmath202 in which the function @xmath203 has been removed by partial integration .",
    "the only assumptions we need make about the depth distribution of proton formation in the late stage of shower development are that it is small outside the interval @xmath204 and that @xmath205 is smaller than @xmath206 though not necessarily so by as much as an order of magnitude .",
    "a suitable function would be , @xmath207 in terms of which we could express @xmath180 as an explicit function of @xmath150 , which would be needed to obtain numerical values for the root @xmath208 of equation ( 27 ) .",
    "however , we are primarily concerned here not with growth rates but with the boundary between stability and instability and so shall not proceed with numerical solutions for @xmath201 . fortunately , it is possible to obtain a sufficient condition for the existence of instability independently of the form of @xmath209 .",
    "provided @xmath210 , which is clearly satisfied , we can see directly from the values of the integrand in equation ( 27 ) at the limits and from its lack of an extremum that , @xmath211 and therefore that equation ( 27 ) can be replaced by the inequality , @xmath212 thus@xmath213 satisfy the inequalities , @xmath214 from the first of these , we can see that the real part of @xmath201 must satisfy @xmath215 , provided the proton formation region in the shower is sufficiently compact that , @xmath216 with greater compactness , @xmath217 , as would be expected .",
    "the second inequality gives the condition for @xmath218 , that is , fluctuation growth .",
    "at the threshold where @xmath219 , and for @xmath220 , it is simply @xmath221 .    the @xmath37-dependence of @xmath30 was represented in paper i as an approximate power law , @xmath222 with @xmath223 for @xmath224 but with the reservation that this would certainly become invalid for an atmosphere of ions with @xmath225 which would be almost completely ionized .",
    "therefore , we should anticipate quite large values of @xmath226 at small @xmath37 , sufficient to give the unstable behaviour found here .",
    "stability clearly depends on the energy flux from photo - ionization .",
    "low fluxes and moderate rates of proton formation in the gdr region of the showers , such that the nuclear charge inferred from equation ( 20 ) is @xmath227 , allow a stable time - independent progression of nuclear charge as a function of depth below the polar - cap surface as given by @xmath161 .",
    "but larger values of @xmath30 and smaller @xmath160 lead to instability . (",
    "the value of @xmath159 is unimportant , provided it is not small , and for order of magnitude estimations in this paper we have assumed @xmath228 unless otherwise stated . )    unfortunately , our analysis of the instability of nuclear movement to the polar - cap surface is limited to small fluctuations and does not extend to large amplitudes .",
    "but it is not difficult to see the form it would take .",
    "an atmosphere of high-@xmath37 ions at time @xmath185 produces a high reverse - electron energy flux which creates a layer of low-@xmath160 ions in the shower maximum region @xmath204 .",
    "these flow toward the surface at @xmath38 and form a low-@xmath37 atmosphere at time @xmath229 which produces a low reverse - electron energy flux and correspondingly large values of @xmath160 .",
    "the ions accelerated alternate between high and low-@xmath37 values .",
    "the basic unit of time is given by the time @xmath230 for the emission at the goldreich - julian current density of one radiation length of ions , @xmath231 the high-@xmath37 intervals are subject to short time - scale instability as described in section 3 , but low-@xmath37 intervals have little or no reverse - electron flux and therefore no possibility of significant positron acceleration and electron - positron pair production .",
    "the instability outlined here is of quite simple form , but there are complicating factors that have been mentioned earlier in the section 2 consideration of polar - cap parameters .",
    "evaluations of the melting temperature discussed following equation ( 8) show that there is every possibility that the condensed matter state below the atmosphere may be liquid , or a solid close to melting with a high self - diffusion rate .",
    "this would have no effect on short time - scale instability but could complicate the behaviour of the system over medium time - scales .",
    "the melting temperature is @xmath37-dependent so that a density inversion is possible , the upper layer of higher-@xmath37 being either liquid or solid . in the liquid case , we must anticipate rayleigh - taylor instability , which may also exist in the solid case because its shear modulus ( see equation 9 ) may not be adequate to maintain mechanical stability .",
    "all these processes are occurring at depths @xmath232 cm but over a polar cap whose radius is of the order of @xmath233 cm .",
    "consequently , a further complication is that different polar - cap areas are unlikely to be in phase with each other .",
    "these problems are considered further , though necessarily in a qualitative way , in section 5 .",
    "the time - dependent phenomena considered in sections 3 and 4 are local and one - dimensional because both shower depth @xmath90 and atmospheric scale height are very many orders of magnitude smaller than the polar - cap radius .",
    "this introduces the question of whether or not there is coherence over the whole polar - cap area .",
    "both instabilities are dependent on the parameter @xmath30 which is a function of the surface nuclear charge @xmath234 and to a lesser extent of surface temperature and acceleration field .",
    "for this reason alone , we see no case for assuming complete coherence and anticipate that the polar cap we describe has zones of proton and ion emission which can not be stationary , the total areas of each being determined , approximately , by the average value of @xmath30 . for neutron stars that are unable to support spontaneous pair production by curvature radiation ,",
    "the proton zones have no reverse electron flux , do not support pair production , and hence merely produce an accelerated one - component plasma as described in section 3 .",
    "but the ion zones will support ics pair production and so appear as moving sources within the polar cap . in this section , we shall attempt to compare possible forms this motion might take with some of the observed phenomena in radio pulsars .    the distinction between the average pulse profile and individual sub - pulses within it",
    "was noted almost immediately following the discovery of pulsars ( see , for example , smith 1977 ) .",
    "the amplitude and form of successive sub - pulses can vary in times of the order of the rotation period and in some pulsars , observed with higher resolution , sub - pulses have micro - structure of @xmath235 s time - scale .",
    "there are also more organized phenomena , and for recent extensive surveys of these we refer to wang et al ( 2007 ) in the case of pulse nulls and to weltevrede , edwards & stappers ( 2006 ) for sub - pulse drift .",
    "there is a move toward a consensus ( lyne et al 2010 ) that quasi - periodic switching between magnetospheric states with different spin - down rates is the basis of mode - changing .",
    "these authors even suggest that it is the source of a large component of pulsar timing noise .",
    "however , it is also true that the subpulse characteristics observed in a small number of pulsars are quite singular , but here discussion is confined to the general features of subpulses .    given the properties of the medium time - scale instability described in section 4 , it is natural to associate with nulls those intervals in which high-@xmath37 ion zones either do not exist or are confined to areas of the polar cap from which radiation produced by the plasma is not visible to the observer . for sufficiently low values of @xmath160 , ions are accelerated from the surface completely ionized so that there is no reverse - electron flux and hence no pair creation and radio emission .",
    "the current density is little changed in the open sector of the magnetosphere but the absence of pair creation means that the particle content near the light cylinder is quite different as are the components of the momentum density or stress tensor on any spherical surface in this region centred on the star .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that the spin - down torque is reduced during the interval of a null , as has been observed in psr b1931 + 24 ( kramer et al 2006 ) .",
    "neutron stars with small @xmath30 such that @xmath227 are likely to have @xmath236 and so will have a steady - state progressively reducing nuclear charge @xmath161 , no medium time - scale instablity , and no long - term nulls .",
    "but the questions about melting and mechanical stability of the polar cap which were mentioned at the end of section 4 remain and the whole system is so complex and difficult to describe in physical terms that we are unable to give useful quantitative predictions .",
    "however , incomplete nulls , having a low but detectable level of emission should be observed .",
    "it is also unsurprising that nulls are observed to be not completely random ( redman & rankin 2009 ) .    to some extent and unfortunately , the same remarks have to be made about the effects of short time - scale instability . for temperatures",
    "@xmath237 , the proton diffusion time is much longer than in the case of the very thin atmosphere assumed in paper i but remains difficult to calculate with complete confidence . in order to describe the polar cap it is necessary to introduce coordinates @xmath238 on a surface perpendicular to @xmath4 . as in paper",
    "i , the proton current density at any point @xmath239 can be related to the ion current density through the definition of @xmath30 , @xmath240 in which @xmath241 is the normalized proton diffusion - time distribution . without the @xmath242 term , whose significance is described below , this would be a homogeneous volterra equation of the second kind having no non - zero square - integrable solution .",

    "most of the diffusion time is in the drift - velocity phase , in which case the time distribution would be more suitably approximated by a normalized gaussian function centred at @xmath243 or , in the limit , by @xmath244 , where @xmath245 is derived from equation ( 13 ) of section 3 .",

    "the total current density @xmath249 is fixed by the boundary conditions and at @xmath38 differs little from the goldreich - julian value .",
    "thus @xmath248 and @xmath250 until the instant at which the atmosphere is exhausted and @xmath163 falls to some residual value @xmath251 .",
    "then ion flow recommences almost immediately ( in a time much shorter than the growth time for spontaneous curvature radiation pairs ) and continues until proton diffusion grows sufficiently to re - form the proton atmosphere .",
    "the durations of the time intervals for ion and proton emission are those for electron - positron pair creation or otherwise , and labelled @xmath252 and @xmath253 are given by , @xmath254 therefore @xmath252 and @xmath253 both depend on the smallness of @xmath241 for small values of @xmath255 . in the @xmath256-function limit for @xmath241 , we have @xmath257 .",
    "estimates of the parameter @xmath222 were given in paper i , but are repeated here , @xmath258 with @xmath223 for @xmath259 . in these expressions , @xmath260 is not the local surface temperature but is an average for radiation emitted over the whole polar - cap , and @xmath21 is the actual polar - cap magnetic flux density . for @xmath261 ,",
    "the values of @xmath262 given need to be modified , though not greatly , to allow for the high-@xmath21 values of @xmath29 contained in table 1 .",
    "guided by the estimates contained in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , we anticipate that except for a very small number of neutron stars , the surface temperature is at all times @xmath263 so that the case ( ii ) boundary condition is always maintained and ion emission is never temperature - limited .",
    "it is limited instead by the fact that the proton atmosphere forms above the ions and the protons are preferentially accelerated , as described in section 3 .",
    "the only effect of the temperature variations described by equation ( 11 ) that occur as a result of alternating proton and ion emission is to change the density of the lte ion atmosphere .",
    "it is also worth observing that the local nature of equation ( 34 ) is not disturbed by the presence of @xmath24 drift above the polar cap .",
    "although this slightly displaces a reverse electron shower relative to the point from which the ion was accelerated , it has no effect on ion emission , which is not temperature - dependent .    in view of the time - variation described by equations ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) , is it possible to imagine organized rather than chaotic motion of ion zones on the polar cap ?",
    "an example of chaotic motion would be the existence of very many small zones without obvious organization .",
    "two simple organized cases would be motion along a slot of constant rotational latitude and circular motion at constant @xmath264 . with the deshpande & rankin ( 1999 ) analysis of psr b0943 + 10 in mind , we consider circular motion .",
    "equations ( 34 ) and ( 35 ) are local in @xmath265 and contain no information that can determine an ion zone movement velocity @xmath266 .",
    "the quantities that are essentially constant are @xmath30 and , apart from the effect of varying lte atmospheric temperature , @xmath245 .",
    "thus the circulation time for @xmath267 ion zones , is @xmath268 , where @xmath1 is the band separation in the usual notation by which subpulse drift is described , and here is given by @xmath269 in the @xmath256-function limit of the diffusion function @xmath241 .",
    "in this system , the velocity @xmath266 is determined by @xmath267 for fixed values of @xmath30 and @xmath245 .",
    "for the same reason , drift direction is also unspecified and there is nothing to preclude a change in @xmath267 or a reversal following some disturbance to the polar - cap surface such as might be a consequence of the kind of mechanical instability briefly described in section 4 . the drift time is determined principally by diffusion through the more dense layers of the atmosphere . from equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) it is , @xmath270 in section 3 we observed that atmospheric density at @xmath38 is an exponential function of @xmath263 so that its value is essentially unpredictable .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the density discontinuity at @xmath38 is small and that the reverse - electron showers may be contained entirely within the atmosphere . in this case , the lower integration limit in equation ( 38 ) must be replaced by @xmath271 .",
    "the diffusion time is then not directly a function of @xmath21 , but is dependent on surface gravity and on @xmath110 . but",
    "its distribution for all pulsars should be compact .",
    "the distribution in the values of @xmath30 , given by equation ( 36 ) , is probably the more important source of the observed spread in the values of @xmath1 .",
    "detailed calculation of @xmath245 has not been attempted here . in particular ,",
    "our estimates of @xmath272 and @xmath124 are subject to some uncertainty .",
    "the fact that @xmath1 is constant for a particular pulsar whereas the circulation time @xmath273 is dependent on @xmath267 could in principle allow comparison with @xmath274 drift - velocity polar - cap models in which @xmath273 is constant .",
    "it is also worth considering the effect of mechanical instability in allowing leakage of protons ( or low-@xmath37 ions ) to limited areas of the surface as described at the end of section 4 .",
    "the excess protons form a localized atmosphere of greater depth than in surrounding areas , so that ion zones ( with consequent pair creation ) do not form there until it is exhausted .",
    "the observer of radio emission probably sees plasma from no more than a strip of polar - cap area at roughly constant rotational latitude so it is possible that intervals of null emission would be be observed at fixed longitude in a sequence of subpulse bands .    in a survey of @xmath275 pulsars , selected only by",
    "signal - to - noise ratio , weltevrede et al ( 2006 ) found that reversals do occur and that roughly equal numbers of pulsars have subpulse drift to smaller or greater longitudes .",
    "they also comment that subpulse drift is so common a phenomenon that it can not depend on pulsar parameters having extraordinary values .",
    "the band separation @xmath1 is independent of radio frequency , and is not correlated with period @xmath17 , age @xmath276 , or with the inferred dipole field @xmath20 .",
    "measured values of @xmath1 given for 77 pulsars in table 2 of weltevrede et al are mostly contained within a single order of magnitude , @xmath277 s although the distribution has a small tail extending to @xmath278 s. this is quite compact ( for a neutron - star parameter ) and is not inconsistent with the interpretation of subpulse drift given here and with equation ( 37 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath1 , with estimates of @xmath30 found from equations ( 36 ) , indicate @xmath279 s and @xmath280 @xmath95 , values that are by no means unreasonable .",
    "it is necessary to compare our polar - cap model with two other sets of pulsar observations . given that protons are the major fraction of particles accelerated and produce no electron - positron pairs , it is worthwhile considering the radio luminosity @xmath281 .",
    "the order of magnitude of this can be expressed as , @xmath282 in terms of the neutron - star radius @xmath151 and the inferred dipole field @xmath20 . from this",
    "we can estimate the energy @xmath283 radiated into solid angle @xmath284 within bandwidth @xmath285 per unit charge ( baryonic or leptonic ) accelerated at the polar cap . using the 400 mhz luminosities listed in the atnf catalogue ( manchester et al 2005 ) and a bandwidth @xmath286 mhz , we find by evaluating equation ( 37 ) for a small sample ( b0826 - 34 , b0834 + 06 , b0943 + 10 , b0950 + 08 , b1055 - 52 , b1133 + 16 , b1929 + 10 ) that typical values are in the interval @xmath287 mev .",
    "even though the emission solid angle is likely to be as small as @xmath288 sterad , there must be some concern here because the number of ics pairs produced per primary accelerated positron ( harding & muslimov 2002 ) is not large so that either the conversion of electron - positron energy to coherent radio emission is efficient or other plasma components are involved , as in the paper by cheng & ruderman ( 1980 )",
    ".    a second set of observations that are relevant are those of polar - cap blackbody x - ray luminosities .",
    "the blackbody x - ray emission expected from a polar - cap of ion and proton zones can be found from equation ( 11 ) .",
    "the reverse - electron flux from photo - ionization heats an ion zone at a rate @xmath289 within a time interval @xmath290 .",
    "an estimate of this can be obtained directly from the mean electron energy per unit nuclear charge accelerated , given by equation ( 29 ) of paper i , and is , @xmath291 in units of erg cm@xmath23 s@xmath96 .",
    "in this expression , @xmath260 is not the local surface temperature but is an average for radiation emitted over the whole polar cap .",
    "the surface temperature derived from equation ( 11 ) with neglect of radiative loss is @xmath293 and increases very rapidly , so that the limiting temperature , @xmath294 derived from @xmath289 is reached at @xmath295 .",
    "the cooling at @xmath296 is also rapid so that the major part of the x - ray luminosity is that of a black body at @xmath297 and of area approximately equal to the canonical dipole - field area @xmath298 divided by @xmath299 .",
    "there have been many attempts to measure the polar - cap blackbody temperature and source area of a subset of radio pulsars .",
    "we refer to zavlin & pavlov ( 2004 ) for b0950 + 08 ; de luca et al ( 2005 ) for b0656 + 14 and b1055 - 52 ; tepedelenliolu & gelman ( 2005 ) for b0628 - 28 ; zhang , sanwal & pavlov ( 2005 ) for b0943 + 10 ; kargaltsev , pavlov & garmire ( 2006 ) for b1133 + 16 ; gil et al ( 2008 ) for b0834 + 06 ; misanovic , pavlov & garmire ( 2008 ) for b1929 + 10 .",
    "five pulsars ( b0628 - 28 , b0834 + 06 , b0943 + 10 , b1133 + 16 , b1929 + 10 ) have source areas one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the canonical area , but unfortunately , a systematic comparison with equations ( 40)-(42 ) is not possible because in most instances the authors are able to say only that the observed x - ray spectrum is consistent with the stated temperature and source area .",
    "the quoted source temperatures are @xmath300 k and are larger than those predicted by equation ( 42 ) unless it is assumed that @xmath301 .",
    "they are also uncomfortably large in the context of @xmath274 drift - velocity polar - cap models such as that developed by gil , melikidze & geppert ( 2003 ) although it must be conceded that this model allows an interesting test of its validity ( see gil , melikidze & zhang 2007 ) .",
    "however , the case ( iii ) surface electric - field boundary condition on which these models rely could be maintained only for ion cohesive energies of @xmath302 kev which in turn would imply actual fields two orders of magnitude or more larger than the atnf catalogue dipole field .",
    "this paper is a continuation of a previous study ( paper i ) of isolated neutron stars with positive corotational charge density and surface electric - field boundary condition @xmath0 at the polar cap .",
    "the reverse flux of electrons arising from photo - ionization of accelerated ions is incident on the neutron - star surface and produces protons through formation and decay of the giant dipole resonance in the later stages of electromagnetic shower development .",
    "protons are the major component of the accelerated plasma but we find that a time - independent composition of ions , protons and positrons is usually unstable .",
    "the consequences of these phenomena should be observable in pulsars unless , of course , rendered nugatory by some factor not properly taken into account here .",
    "but we emphasize that there are almost certainly other sources of instability contributing to the complex behaviour observed in radio pulsars that may be present in each of cases ( i ) - ( iii ) .",
    "there are two instabilities which result in transitions between states of different plasma composition above localized areas on the polar cap and it is suggested here that these are the basis for the commonly observed phenomena of nulls and of subpulse drift .",
    "the basic units of time are @xmath303 s for the short time - scale instability and for the medium time - scale , @xmath304 s. these instabilities are not primarily electromagnetic in origin and will not be present in neutron stars with negative corotational charge density and electron acceleration .",
    "micropulses of @xmath305 s duration are also present in some pulsar emissions but are unlikely to be associated with the instabilities we consider here",
    ". there appears to be no reason why both signs of corotational charge density should not be present in the isolated neutron - star population and it would be interesting to see if there is any observational evidence for an associated division of the atnf catalogue pulsars .",
    "the transitions are principally in plasma composition and the current density at the neutron star surface remains close to @xmath306 .",
    "the electric potential @xmath307 in the open magnetosphere above the polar cap is also almost unchanged .",
    "these transitions are , in principle , observable because there are no processes by which electron - positron pair creation can occur in a plasma containing only protons , whereas it does occur in the ion plasma .",
    "thus there will be no coherent radio emission in the proton phase if we assume , as is usual , that a pair plasma is a necessary constituent for it .",
    "both the medium time - scale instability and the mechanical instability of the neutron - star surface mentioned in section 4 provide a basis for pulse nulls , but unfortunately , not one that is suitable for quantitative prediction .",
    "the short time - scale instability is more interesting .",
    "we show that at any instant , the polar cap is divided into moving ion and proton zones and consider organized motion of these , specifically the circular movement of compact ion zones around the magnetic pole .",
    "we make the hypothesis that such motions can occur ( following recent work by deshpande & rankin 1999 ) but have not attempted to show that they have long - term stability , to the extent indicated by observation , against decay to a chaotic state .",
    "this is of some interest because it shows that features usually considered to require the surface - field boundary condition @xmath308 are possible under the @xmath0 condition .",
    "actual polar magnetic flux densities exceeding @xmath309 g are necessary for the former condition and it must be doubtful that such fields , two orders of magnitude greater than the inferred ( catalogue ) dipole field , are likely to exist in the very large number of pulsars observed by weltevrede et al ( 2006 ) to show subpulse drift .",
    "our view of subpulse drift is also interesting in that the motion is not an @xmath274 drift velocity as in the model of ruderman & sutherland .",
    "the fixed parameters for a given neutron star are the band separation @xmath1 , and @xmath30 which is the number of protons produced per unit ion charge accelerated .",
    "this latter parameter approximately determines the ratio of the total areas of proton and ion zones on the polar cap at any instant .",
    "thus the circulation time @xmath268 depends on @xmath267 , the number of ion zones , and is not necessarily constant as it would be in the @xmath2 drift velocity model .",
    "the band separation @xmath1 is dependent on @xmath30 and on the diffusion time @xmath245 and so is independent of rotation period @xmath17 and almost independent of @xmath21 .",
    "we have assumed here , following the pair formation calculations of hibschman & arons ( 2001 ) and harding & muslimov ( 2002 ) , that spontaneous pair creation by curvature radiation is not possible in most isolated neutron stars . those with a sufficiently large value of @xmath310 to support spontaneous cr pair creation , predominantly young high - field pulsars , are not expected to show the instabilities we have considered here .",
    "these authors actually considered case ( i ) in which the basis of plasma formation is an electron current density close to @xmath311 at the surface accelerated to energies sufficient for ics or spontaneous cr pair formation . in case ( ii )",
    ", the protons and ions form the basic current component with @xmath312 broadly the same as in case ( i ) apart from the ion inertia term which is very small for electrons .",
    "thus the condition for the spontaneous growth of cr pair formation is very similar in cases ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "although the reverse electron flux arising from cr pair formation in case ( ii ) is probably quite a small fraction of @xmath313 , it is likely that , for the large values of @xmath314 that are necessary , there will be a proton atmosphere which is never exhausted . in this instance ,",
    "steady - state plasma formation and low - altitude acceleration appear probable , though subject to possible instabilities at those higher altitudes where the coherent radiation is formed .",
    "the same statement can be made about all case ( i ) pulsars whether or not spontaneous cr pair formation is supported .",
    "microstructure with @xmath315 s timescales is likely to be a consequence of such higher - altitude instabilities .",
    "the reason for this assumption is that the case ( i ) boundary condition on @xmath192 needs only an electron density on the surface separating open from closed magnetospheres .",
    "the small electron cohesive energy means that there is no reason why this should not be maintained at all times , as is also true for the goldreich - julian electron current density . for this boundary condition",
    ", there is no obvious way in which non - electromagnetic time - constants can influence plasma formation and acceleration at altitudes less than @xmath316 cm above the polar cap .",
    "it is possible , perhaps , to assign either this boundary condition or case ( ii ) with spontaneous cr pair formation to those pulsars in the systematic study of weltevrede et al ( 2006 ) , approximately one half of the total in number , that do not exhibit subpulse drift .",

    "<S> the two states coexist at any instant of time above different moving elements of area on the polar cap and provide a physically consistent basis for a description of pulse nulls and subpulse drift . in the latter case , it is shown that the band separation @xmath1 is determined not by the @xmath2 drift velocity , as is generally assumed , but by the diffusion time for protons produced in reverse - electron showers to reach the region of the atmosphere from which they are accelerated . </S>",
