    "to accomplish spin dependent conduction in electronic devices has become a very intense quest in recent years .",
    "@xcite the ii - vi dilute magnetic semiconductors , like cdmnte and znmnse , seem to be the most promising materials for achieving this goal . at low doping levels",
    "these systems exhibit an enhanced zeeman splitting of the electronic levels that arises from strong kondo - like exchange between the embedded mn ions and the delocalized electronic states .",
    "moreover , the ii - vi dilute magnetic semiconductors are n - type conductors with relative good mobility and large spin coherence times ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "however , an open question remains as to how the magnetic interaction between the localized spins and the itinerant carriers reflects on the transport properties of these structures .",
    "the purpose of this work is to analyze some aspects of this problem .    since the zeeman splitting of the electron levels was found to be independent of the local magnetic environment @xcite , a simple model of a ii - vi magnetic semiconductor is a spin polarized electron gas in the presence of a static magnetic field .",
    "the field lifts the spin degeneracy and induces an equilibrium polarization , @xmath1 .",
    "the strong magnetic interaction between the itinerant carriers and the localized spins is reflected in the large value of the effective gyromagnetic factor , @xmath2 , up to hundreds of times the band value . on account of the large @xmath2 ,",
    "even low magnetic fields are enough to produce large polarizations , and it is assumed that @xmath3 can vary continuously between @xmath4 and @xmath5 as a function of the static magnetic field .",
    "this approximation integrates out the degrees of freedom of the static spins under the enlarged value of @xmath2 and focuses on the itinerant carriers and the many body interaction among them .",
    "the latter is independent of the source of the spin polarization , and we expect our results to maintain their validity also in the case of a self - consistent magnetic field as source of the spin polarization , a situation which is consistent with an itinerant ferromagnet .",
    "the model can also be extended to describe the paramagnetic state of the iii - v magnetic heterostructures where a mostly uniform internal magnetic field is created by having a magnetic ion density much larger than the itinerant - carrier density .",
    "@xcite however , the small electronic densities in the iii - v based compounds make difficult the blind use of the paramagnetic electron gas model .",
    "the explicit spin dependence of the electron - electron interaction becomes manifest when the exchange ( x ) and correlation ( c ) effects of the local coulomb repulsion are included . at finite values of the polarization ,",
    "the many - body short range interaction , which is density dependent , is different for up and down spin electrons .",
    "a realistic picture of the electronic interaction and its screening is obtained by using spin dependent local field correction functions , @xmath6 , that describe the exchange and correlation hole around each electron .",
    "the self consistent treatment of exchange and correlation effects has proved very important in understanding the physics of normal metals , @xcite but to our knowledge it has not been fully analyzed in spin - polarized systems , where the spin dependence of the local field corrections becomes manifest .",
    "in addition , the relevance of exchange and correlation effects increases as the dimensionality of the electron gas is lowered .",
    "for example , the importance of local effects is clearly reflected in the dielectric function of an unpolarized two - dimensional electron gas , which becomes overscreened in a wide range of momenta and electronic density .",
    "@xcite however , calculations where these effects are absent , such as the conventional random phase approximation , predict a positive dielectric function for the whole parameter range .",
    "therefore , we believe it is fundamental to include these local effects in a complete treatment of the quasi - two - dimensional diluted magnetic semiconductors .    obtaining the exact frequency and",
    "wave vector dependence of the local field corrections is a very difficult problem which remains unsolved even in the case of the unpolarized electron system .",
    "fortunately , the asymptotic values of the local field factors can be obtained exactly in two limiting cases . at zero frequency and small wavevectors , sum rules",
    "are used to connect the static limits of the response functions to certain thermodynamic coefficients . @xcite for large frequency and large wavevector , an iterative method generates the exact expressions for the local field functions up to second order .",
    "@xcite this approach uses the equation of motion satisfied by the wigner distribution function of the particle density .",
    "numerical estimates of the response functions of the three dimensional unpolarized electron gas have shown that local field factors smoothly interpolate between the asymptotic small and large wave - vector behavior.@xcite this feature is expected to exist also in the case of a spin polarized system , and , consequently , we use the exact asymptotic values of @xmath6 for large and small momentum at zero frequency @xcite as a starting point in obtaining their approximate expressions across the whole spectrum of momentum .",
    "then , @xmath7 are used to calculate the spin dependent effective electron interaction potentials , @xmath8 .",
    "we compare two interpolation schemes to conclude that the effective potentials are qualitatively independent of the approximation used for the local field correction functions at intermediate momenta .    in section",
    "ii , we present the self consistent formulation of the effective interaction that incorporates the spin dependent local field corrections following the approach of kukkonen and overhauser @xcite generalized for a spin polarized electron system.@xcite this formalism permits the derivation of the effective spin dependent scattering potentials experienced by an electron and of the response functions . in section iii , we discuss in detail the procedure used to obtain the approximate expressions for the local field factors .",

    "the simplest approximation of the effective interaction in the electron gas is the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , which incorporates the screening but ignores the exchange and correlation effects .",

    "@xcite in their model of the electron - electron interaction , the exchange ( x ) and correlation ( c ) are explicitly incorporated by considering associated local field factors , @xmath13 , in the expression of the effective potential experienced by one electron in the presence of all the rest . in a self - consistent formulation ,",
