    ". therefore realistic modifications of gravity should contain a mechanism to suppress scalar interactions at small scales  @xcite or ( to be interesting ) satisfy weak - field tests , but deviate from gr at some energy scale .",
    "some models satisfying these requirements belongs to the so - called horndeski theory  @xcite , the most general scalar - tensor theory with second - order equations of motion .    in scalar - tensor theories ,",
    "the scalar field may directly couple to matter , and hence matter does not follow geodesics associated with the metric @xmath0 but with another @xmath1 . in the simplest case",
    "these two metrics are related as @xmath2 which is known as the conformal coupling @xcite .",
    "the two frames described by @xmath0 and @xmath1 are often referred to as the einstein and jordan frames , respectively .      for relativistic stars , such as neutron stars ( nss ) ,",
    "the conformal coupling to matter can trigger a tachyonic instability ( due to a negative effective mass ) of the scalar field when the star has a compactness above a certain threshold .",
    "this instability _ spontaneously scalarizes _ the ns , whereupon it harbors a nontrivial scalar field configuration which smoothly decays outside the star . in its simplest realization",

    "this theory passes all weak - field tests , but the presence of the scalar field can significantly modify the bulk properties of nss , such as masses and radii , in comparison with gr .",
    "this effect was first analyzed for isolated nss by damour and esposito - farse  @xcite .",
    "the properties and observational consequences of this phenomenon were studied in a number of situations , including stability  @xcite , asteroseismology  @xcite , slow ( and rapidly ) rotating ns solutions  @xcite , its influence on geodesic motion of particles around nss  @xcite , tidal interactions  @xcite and the multipolar structure of the spacetime  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dynamical process of scalarization was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and stellar collapse ( including the associated process of scalar radiation emission ) was investigated in refs .",

    ", the presence of matter can cause the appearance of a nontrivial scalar field configuration , growing `` hair '' on the bh .    on the experimental side",
    ", binary - pulsar observations  @xcite have set stringent bounds on @xmath4 , whose value is presently constrained to be @xmath6 .",
    "this tightly constrains the effects of spontaneous scalarization in isolated nss , for it has been shown that independently of the choice of the equation of state ( eos ) scalarization can occur only if @xmath7 for nss modeled by a perfect fluid  @xcite .",
    "these two results confine @xmath4 to a very limited range , in which , even if it exists in nature , the effects of scalarization on isolated nss are bound to be small ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for examples where the threshold value of @xmath4 can be increased and refs .",
    "@xcite for recent work exploring the large positive @xmath4 region of the theory .",
    "it was recently understood that modern scalar - tensor theories of gravity , under the umbrella of horndeski gravity  @xcite , offer a more general class of coupling  @xcite between the scalar field and matter through the so - called _ disformal coupling _  @xcite @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the covariant derivative of the scalar field associated with the gravity frame metric @xmath0 , and @xmath10 is a constant with dimensions of @xmath11 .",
    "for @xmath12 we recover the purely conformal case of eq .  .",
    "disformal transformations were originally introduced by bekenstein and consist of the most general coupling constructed from the metric @xmath0 and the scalar field @xmath13 that respects causality and the weak equivalence principle  @xcite .",
    "disformal couplings have been investigated so far mainly in the context of cosmology  @xcite .",
    "they also arise in higher - dimensional gravitational theories with moving branes @xcite in relativistic extensions of modified newtonian theories , the tensor - vector - scalar theories  @xcite , and in the decoupling limit of the nonlinear massive gravity @xcite . moreover , in ref .  @xcite it was shown that the mathematical structure of horndeski theory is preserved under the transformation , namely if the scalar - tensor theory written in terms of @xmath0 belongs to a class of the horndeski theory the same theory rewritten in terms of @xmath1 belongs to another class of the horndeski theory .",
    "thus disformal transformations provide a natural generalization of conformal transformations .",
    "disformal coupling was also considered in models of a varying speed of light  @xcite and inflation  @xcite .",
    "the invariance of cosmological observables in the frames related by the disformal relation   was verified in refs .",
    "although applications to early universe models are still limited , disformal couplings have been extensively applied to late - time cosmology  @xcite .",
    "a new screening mechanism of the scalar force in the high - density region was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where in the presence of disformal coupling the nonrelativistic limit of the scalar field equation seemed to be independent of the local energy density . however , a reanalysis suggested that no new screening mechanism from disformal coupling could work @xcite .",
    "it was also argued that disformal coupling could not contribute to a chameleon screening mechanism around a nonrelativistic source @xcite .",
    "experimental and observational constraints on disformal coupling to particular matter sectors have also been investigated .",
    "disformal couplings to baryons and photons have been severely constrained in terms of the nondetection of new physics in collider experiments  @xcite , the absence of spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background and the violation of distance reciprocal relations  @xcite , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "disformal coupling to the dark sector has been proposed in  @xcite and is presently less constrained in comparison with coupling to visible matter sectors .",
    "when conformal and disformal couplings are _ universal _ to all the matter species , they can only be constrained through experimental tests of gravity .",
    "a detailed study of scalar - tensor theory with the pure disformal coupling @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the weak - field limit was presented in  @xcite and the post - newtonian ( pn ) corrections due to the presence of pure disformal coupling were computed  @xcite . in these papers",
    "@xcite , in contrast to the claim of refs .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that no screening mechanism which could suppress the scalar force in the vicinity of the source exists and the difference of the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) parameters from gr are of order @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the present - day hubble scale . the strongest bound on @xmath18 comes from the constraints on the ppn preferred frame parameter @xmath19 .",
    "the near perfect alignment between the sun s spin axis and the orbital angular momenta of the planets provides the constraint @xmath20 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion ) , which implies that @xmath21 . with the inclusion of the conformal factor ,",
    "i.e. @xmath22 , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite argued that the cassini bound @xmath23 @xcite imposes a constraint on @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the cosmological background value of the scalar field and @xmath26 on the other hand the disformal part of the coupling @xmath27 remains unconstrained , because corrections to the ppn parameters which include @xmath28 are subdominant compared to the conformal part .",
    "these weaker constraints on the disformal coupling parameters are due to the fact that in the nonrelativistic regime with negligible pressure and a slowly evolving scalar field the disformal coupling becomes negligible .",
    "we also point out that in the weak - field regime such as in the solar system , typical densities are small therefore preventing the appearance of ghosts in the theory for negative values of @xmath10 .    in the strong - gravity regime such as that found in the interior of nss ,",
    "the pressure can not be neglected and the disformal coupling is expected to be as important as the conformal one .",
    "this would affect the spontaneous scalarization mechanism and consequently influence the structure ( and stability ) of relativistic stars , or have significant impact on gravitational - wave astronomy  @xcite .",
    "the influence of disformal coupling on the stability of matter configurations around bhs was analyzed in ref .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite derived the stability conditions of the system by generalizing the case of pure conformal coupling  @xcite .",
    "they also generalized these works to scalar - tensor theories with noncanonical kinetic terms and disformal coupling , finding that the disformal coupling could make matter configurations more unstable , triggering spontaneous scalarization . in the present work within the same class of scalar - tensor theory considered in ref .",

    "<S> we present a general formulation to analyze the structure of slowly rotating relativistic stars in a broad class of scalar - tensor theories with disformal coupling to matter . </S>",
    "<S> our approach includes theories with generalized kinetic terms , generic scalar field potentials and contains theories with conformal coupling as particular limits . in order to investigate how the disformal coupling affects the structure of relativistic stars , we propose a minimal model of a massless scalar - tensor theory and investigate in detail how the disformal coupling affects the spontaneous scalarization of slowly rotating neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for negative values of the disformal coupling parameter between the scalar field and matter , scalarization can be suppressed , while for large positive values of the disformal coupling parameter stellar models can not be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to put a mild upper bound on this parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that these properties can be qualitatively understood by linearizing the scalar field equation of motion in the background of a general - relativistic incompressible star . to address the intrinsic degeneracy between uncertainties in the equation - of - state of neutron stars and gravitational theory </S>",
    "<S> , we also show the existence of universal equation - of - state - independent relations between the moment of inertia and compactness of neutron stars in this theory . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in a certain range of the theory s parameter space the universal relation largely deviates from that of general relativity , allowing , in principle , to probe the existence of spontaneous scalarization with future observations . </S>"
