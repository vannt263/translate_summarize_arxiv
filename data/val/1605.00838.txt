    "quantum statistics is among the most fundamental concepts in physics and is at the basis of the existence of formidable physical systems at all scales , from bose - einstein condensates to neutron stars .",
    "while in three ( and higher ) spatial dimensions , bosonic and fermionic statistics exhaust all the possibilities , physicists have postulated and then investigated the existence of ( quasi-)particles with generalized statistics , or anyons , in lower dimension for some decades @xcite . in two dimensions , the fractional statistics of the elementary excitation of the quantum hall effect",
    "has certainly represented a huge physical motivation in this direction @xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "numerous models of anyons have been proposed ( @xcite among others ) , but most of them have been thought to be essentially playgrounds for theoreticians for quite a long time .",
    "this perspective seems bound to change in view of the new experimental achievements , in particular concerning cold atoms in optical lattices .",
    "in fact , in the cold atom framework a number of proposals have been formulated that indicate the realization of one - dimensional anyons as feasible within the current experimental techniques . among those proposals , the one elaborated by keilmann et al . @xcite and subsequently refined by greschner and santos @xcite appears to be particularly promising .",
    "their idea starts from ordinary bosonic or fermionic atoms and employs a raman - assisted tunneling process to induce an effective occupation - dependent hopping ; the system obtained in this way can be shown to be equivalent to the anyonic hubbard model , in which the statistical parameter and the on - site interaction can be changed continuously .",
    "more recently , another very interesting experimental scheme has been suggested by strter et al .",
    "@xcite , which makes use of the so - called lattice shaking technique combined with a static tilt of the potential in order to realize the occupation - dependent tunneling .",
    "this scheme does not require any additional lasers other than the ones that form the lattice nor any assumptions on the internal atomic structure .",
    "this kind of developments give reasonable expectations that the knowledge of generalized statistics and its implication on quantum many - body physics collected in extensive studies of one - dimensional models can be progressively tested against experiments .",
    "in fact , one - dimensionality brings about a wealth of theoretical tools that are unavailable in the study of quantum many - body physics in higher dimension , the bethe ansatz being a prominent example .",
    "however , despite the fact that the bethe ansatz solution provides information about the spectrum , the thermodynamic properties , etc .",
    ", in general it does not make the calculation of correlation functions straightforward , so that one has to ultimately rely on extensive numerical computation @xcite . among the most interesting quantities",
    "is the one - body reduced density matrix ( or off -diagonal correlation ) , that is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the @xmath0-body ground - state wavefunction , and gives access to fundamental physical observables such as momentum distribution , one - particle entanglement entropy , natural orbitals and their occupation , etc .",
    "whereas its analytic determination remains a challenging task in general ( see @xcite ) , there is at least a class of models , namely models of impenetrable particles ( or tonks - girardeau models ) in various geometries ( circle , interval with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , harmonic well ) , in which this problem has enjoyed a sensible progress over the last years .",
    "this model is a limiting case of the bethe ansatz integrable lieb - liniger model of bosons @xcite ( or anyons ) in which the zero - range mutual interaction ( @xmath3-interaction ) is infinite ( impenetrable , or hard - core , limit ) .",
    "the relative simplicity of the tonks - girardeau model lies mainly in the fact that the @xmath0-body ground - state wavefunction can be related to the one of free spinless fermions via the boson - fermion @xcite ( or anyon - fermion @xcite ) mapping . starting from this",
    ", it has been shown that @xmath4 in the bosonic case can be exactly expressed as the determinant of a matrix whose symmetry depends on the geometry , _",
    "e.g. _ toeplitz type for circular geometry , hankel type for harmonic well , etc . @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this construction to anyons on a circle has been performed in refs .",
    "besides , in a remarkable work @xcite , gangardt was able to find the full large distance expansion of @xmath4 in a closed form for bosons on a circle and in a harmonic well ; this expansion , which is valid for distances larger than @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a characteristic length depending on the geometry , has the advantage of being analytic and , in practice , yielding very accurate results also for finite @xmath0 .",
    "building upon this , a prescription to apply the replica method to anyons in circular geometry has been proposed and tested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the study of the one - body reduced density matrix to tonks - girardeau anyons trapped by a harmonic potential within the framework described above , possibly providing a theoretical tool for future cold atom experiments which are indeed mainly performed in the presence of the harmonic trapping potential .",

    "since the power series depends on @xmath10 , one must be careful in choosing an appropriate truncation of the double sum . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents ] we plot the powers of @xmath84 corresponding to the first few terms as a function of @xmath10 ; clearly the term @xmath123 shares the same power with the term @xmath124 and the two must be always considered together .",

    "in fact , oscillation are sensibly suppressed , as it appears especially in the real part , but the average does not benefit very much ; this is because an improvement in the average actually requires perturbative corrections to the zero mode . by proceeding to the more refined truncation @xmath148 ( appropriate for this value of @xmath10 ) we note a further improvement in the oscillations , particularly in the imaginary part , and overall a very good agreement which stays within @xmath149 unless @xmath57 is very close to the edges .     for @xmath142 ( black ) , @xmath143 ( blue ) and @xmath150 ( red).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    for @xmath142 ( black ) , @xmath143 ( blue ) and @xmath150 ( red).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in fig .",

    "the @xmath147 truncation , instead , is to some extent more efficient than in the @xmath145 case , which is due to the higher terms being comparatively more suppressed .",
    "it is however important to take the truncation @xmath152 , consistent with this intermediate value of @xmath10 , to further get rid of oscillations , especially in the region of small @xmath57 ( close to @xmath153 ) where the saddle point treatment is only marginally valid .    finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : k07diff ] , which refers to @xmath154 , we immediately note that both the zero - mode and the @xmath147 truncation are worse than in the previous cases by an order of magnitude .",
    "this is explained by the fact that the @xmath132 term is actually quite close to the first two modes for large @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : exponents ] ) and should be consistently included ; indeed the truncation @xmath155 provides the same quality of approximation as achieved by @xmath148 or @xmath152 for lower statistical parameter .     for @xmath142 ( black ) , @xmath143 ( blue ) and @xmath156 ( red).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]    for @xmath142 ( black ) , @xmath143 ( blue ) and @xmath156 ( red).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "in conclusion , we have presented two approaches to the calculation of the one - body reduced density matrix @xmath157 of a gas of @xmath0 harmonically trapped anyons with repulsive @xmath3-interaction in the tonks - girardeau , or hard - core , limit . in the first one we find an exact representation as the determinant of a hankel matrix of dimension @xmath158 ; this generalizes the corresponding construction for bosons . in the second approach ,",
    "we use the replica method with the correct anyonic prescription for the analytic continuation and find a complete asymptotic expansion in analytic form .",
    "we showed that , even for relatively small @xmath0 , the truncation to the first few terms ( appropriately chosen according to @xmath10 ) gives an extremely precise approximation ( within a few percent except near the @xmath139 line and when @xmath159 or @xmath160 get close to the fermi - thomas radius ) .",

    "first , it could be theoretically interesting and in principle doable to extend our work to a system of hard - core anyons in a finite linear geometry with dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions ( the first is physically related to trapping in an infinite square well ) . another promising line of research concerns the study of the non - equilibrium properties of anyon gases .",
