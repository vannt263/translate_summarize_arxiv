    "recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background by the wmap and planck collaborations  @xcite support the inflationary scenario .",
    "most of inflationary models predict a nearly gaussian and scale invariant power spectrum of adiabatic perturbation modes , which can be realized by the single field slow - roll inflationary model .",
    "however , the most recent data released by planck collaboration  @xcite reported a statistically significant anomalies at low multipoles , which corresponds a power deficit 5 - 10@xmath6 at multipole range @xmath7 with @xmath8 - @xmath9 level",
    ". therefore , the usual single field inflation model needs some modification to express the large scale scalar power suppression .",
    "this suppression of the scalar power spectrum was then used to explain the observed low quadrupole in the cmb anisotropy .",
    "there are several interesting approaches which address the scalar power suppression and are relevant to the suppression method pursued in this paper .",
    "the first one is the mechanism studied by hazra et al  @xcite , where the authors introduced a steep potential during the first few e - foldings of inflation",
    ". then there appears a fast roll phase during the large scale modes cross the horizon and the resulting scalar power spectrum is suppressed since it is inversely proportional to the inflaton velocity .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "the second one is related to a nonzero spatial curvature in a single field inflation model . in this case",
    "one can also induce the suppression of the scalar power spectrum on large scales  @xcite . in the same line of thought , recently white et al revisited the open inflation model  @xcite , which gives rise to a suppression of the scalar power on large scales . here",
    "the main source of the suppression is also the steepening of the potential due to the barrier that separates the true and false vacua .    in this paper",
    "we consider a modification of the canonical single field inflation model , which induces large negative running of @xmath10 and results in a suppression of scalar power spectrum on large scales .",
    "can be introduced in the context of reconciling the results of planck and bicep2 collaborations  @xcite , though it has been pointed out that uncertainty from the foreground effect can dominate the excess  @xcite observed by the bicep2 collaborations .",
    "see also for the suppression of the scalar power spectra on large scales  @xcite after the bicep2 observation . ] as a specific model , we consider a deformation of a single field inflation model by adding kinetic terms for a number of scalar moduli fields , @xmath11 we also consider a background solution with spatially linear configurations , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "then the usual cosmological evolution for the single field under the frw metric with the background solution for @xmath16 guarantees the homogeneity and isotropy of the cosmological principle  @xcite . in the perturbation level ,",
    "fluctuations for @xmath17 , ( @xmath15 ) , are decoupled and have no influence to cosmological observables  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we consider the @xmath18 case for simplicity .",
    "this model corresponds to the case with @xmath19 in the work  @xcite . on the other hand , without the usual single inflaton field contribution , inflation is also possible when one uses higher order combination of @xmath20 , ( @xmath21 ) , with spatially linear configuration of @xmath16 .",
    "this inflation model is known as the solid inflation  @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .    in our model",
    "the background evolution is the same with that of the single field model with the curvature term of the open universe .",
    "that is , the solution @xmath12 induces the curvature term of the open universe in the friedmann equation , though we start from the flat frw metric . in the background evolution as _",
    "spatial condensation_. ] the curvature term is proportional to inverse square of the scale factor , and so the effect of _ the spatial condensation _ appears during the very early stage of the inflation and disappears quickly as the scale factor grows up .",
    "since we start from the phase where the curvature term is much more dominant than the potential term of the single field , there appears a phase transition from the curvature term dominant phase to the potential term dominant phase .",
    "due to the phase transition in the early stage of the background evolution , there appears the suppression of the scalar power spectrum .",
    "this situation has some resemblance to that of inflation models referred as ` whipped inflation '  @xcite and ` open inflation '  @xcite , in which there exist phase transitions from the fast - roll phase to the slow - roll phase of the single scalar field model .",
    "these phase transitions during the early stage of inflation induces the suppression of the scalar power spectrum on large scales , though the detailed suppression mechanisms are different from that in our model .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain the properties of the background evolution under the spatial condensation . in section 3 ,",
    "we investigate the effects of the spatial condensation in linear perturbation level .",
    "we find the suppression of the scalar power spectrum and large value of the running of the scalar spectral index on large scales .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "we start from the action for the single field inflation model with an additional triad of moduli scalar fields , @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath23 denotes the planck mass , @xmath24 .",
    "the so(3)-symmetric fields @xmath16 have no potential . then equations of motion of the scalar fields @xmath16 are read as @xmath25 under the background frw metric , @xmath26 with the scale factor @xmath27 , the spatially linear configuration @xmath28 satisfies the equations . here",
    "the constant gradient @xmath29 is an arbitrary dimensionless parameter . as usual inflation models which are not compatible with the cosmological principle of homogeneity and isotropy in the background evolution , we assume that the field @xmath30 depends on time only .",
    "then the remaining equations of motion of @xmath31 and @xmath30 in are given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 . as was discussed in @xcite , the @xmath29-terms in correspond to the curvature terms by identifying the curvature constant @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "since the curvature constant is negative in this case , the equations representing the background evolution in are the same with those of the open universe in the single field inflation model .",
    "though the single field model in the open universe is the same with our model in the background level , they are different in the perturbation level due to the contribution of fluctuation modes of @xmath16 . in our case",
    "three degrees of freedom ( one scalar mode and two vector modes ) originated from the triad of scalar fields appear in the perturbation level , while there is no additional perturbation degree of freedom in the usual single field inflation model with negative curvature constant .",
    "now we investigate some characteristic properties of the background evolution of our model .",
    "the effect of @xmath29-terms in is decreasing rapidly during the inflation and has some influence on the early time of the inflation period .",
    "especially as we see in the first line of the hubble horizon @xmath37 starts from a small value when we introduce a large value of the @xmath29-dependent term at the initial state , increases during the early stage of the inflation , and approaches the value of the single field inflation model at late time .    in our model",
    ", the suppression of scalar power spectrum on large scales can be achieved by introducing a large value of @xmath29-term at the early time of inflation . for that purpose",
    ", we consider the case that the @xmath29-term in the first equation of is much larger than the potential term of the inflaton field , i.e. , @xmath38 obtaining analytic solution for the equations in is a formidable task for the potentials of the large field inflation models .",
    "so we rely on a semi - analytic way to figure out the behaviour of the background evolution governed by the equations in , based on numerical method . by employing the simplest scalar potential @xmath39 , for concreteness , we find that the scalar field @xmath30 remains almost constant until the e - folding number @xmath40 .",
    "see fig.1 . then there appears a stage that the value of @xmath29-term is comparable to that of the potential , i.e. , @xmath41 after the universe passes through this stage , the scalar field starts to decrease and follows the behaviour of the canonical slow - roll inflation .",
    "the behaviours of the background scalar field and the hubble horizon with respect to the e - folding number @xmath42 are plotted in fig.1 .",
    "[ nsolbk ]    [ 0.57 ]  [ fig1 ]    as we see in fig.1 , there is a sharp transition point near @xmath43 where @xmath44 represents the e - folding number when the @xmath29-term is the same with the potential of the scalar field .",
    "after the transition point the background evolution rapidly follows the behaviour of the usual slow - roll inflation by rolling down the potential slop . for this reason",
    ", we can approximate the background equations in under the assumption of the slow - rolling of the scalar field as follows : @xmath45 where @xmath46 with an initial value of the scalar field @xmath47 . from the relation we also have the relation @xmath48    in the early time",
    ", the background equation has a solution  @xcite .",
    "@xmath49 where @xmath50 is the initial time with the scale factor @xmath51 . on the other hand ,",
    "in the late time for a given value of @xmath29 , the scale factor ` @xmath52 ' is already very large , and then the @xmath29-term in becomes much smaller than the potential term .",
    "based on the numerical result during the late time in fig.1 , we see that the scalar field starts to roll down the potential slope matching the behaviour of the usual slow - roll approximation .",
    "since the behaviour of the background evolution for the case @xmath53 was already investigated in @xcite , we omit the detailed background behaviours in this paper .",
    "we consider the linear scalar perturbation of the frw metric , @xmath54dx^i dx^j,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 are four scalar modes . in the linear perturbation",
    ", there is also a contribution from fluctuations of scalar fields , @xmath59 the three perturbation modes @xmath60 are decomposed into one scalar and two vector modes , @xmath61 in this work , we focus on the scalar mode @xmath62 in perturbation level .",

    "to see this fact explicitly , one can read the @xmath63-component of the perturbed einstein equation @xmath64 as @xmath65 taking the curl of both sides of , we obtain @xmath66 .",
    "that is , only the longitudinal scalar mode can satisfy this relation . ]",
    "since the kinetic term of @xmath16 in is a well - defined quadratic form , the kinetic term of the three perturbation modes @xmath67 s is also well - defined and does not violate the energy condition . here",
    "we express the longitudinal mode @xmath62 in terms of a scalar mode @xmath68 with a normalization  @xcite , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the comoving wave number .",
    "we introduce the @xmath71 factor to define the canonical kinetic term for the scalar mode @xmath68 in the form of the perturbed lagrangian .    employing the spatially flat gauge @xmath72 ,",
    "the perturbed scalar equations are reduced to @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are gauge invariant quantities  @xcite .",
    "scalar modes @xmath55 and @xmath56 satisfy the constraints , @xmath76 using these constraints one can express the modes @xmath55 and @xmath56 in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in this multifield perturbation system , the comoving curvature perturbation is written as  @xcite @xmath79 . \\label{icp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] differently from the single field inflation model , there is also non - vanishing isocurvature perturbation  @xcite .",
    "however , here we only concentrate on the adiabatic curvature perturbation .      as we discussed in section 2",
    ", there are two inflation phases in the background evolution , the @xmath29-term dominant phase and the scalar potential dominant phase . due to the phase transition during the inflation",
    ", the computation of the power spectrum is different from that of the usual single scalar field model . in order to calculate power spectrum and related observational quantities , such as the scalar spectral index @xmath10 and the running of the spectral index @xmath80 , we use the method developed in @xcite , where the authors calculated the power spectrum of the single scalar field model with the potential having a step transition . due to the shape of the scalar potential , there are two inflationary phases , fast - roll phase and slow - roll phase .",
    "the origin of the phase transition in @xcite is different from ours , but there is a robust similarity between these two cases in the sense that there is a transition during the inflation and the background evolution approaches the usual slow - roll inflation phase of the single field model at late time .",
    "for this reason , we follow the method developed in @xcite to compute the power spectrum and related perturbation quantities . due to the phase transition in the background level",
    ", there is also a phase transition to the perturbed equations in .",
    "we try to solve the perturbed equations for the @xmath29-term dominant phase and the scalar potential dominant phase separately and apply the matching condition at the transition point .      in the early time having the limit @xmath81",
    ", we obtain @xmath55 , @xmath56 from in the leading order of the limit as @xmath82 using the relation and the fact that @xmath30 is almost a constant during the @xmath29-term dominant phase , we conclude that the @xmath55-dependent term in is negligible .",
    "one can also neglect @xmath83 and @xmath84-dependent terms in since @xmath85 is almost constant in the early time phase . introducing the sasaki - mukhanov variables , @xmath86 and the conformal time coordinate @xmath87 , we obtain the decoupled differential equations for @xmath88 and @xmath89 as @xmath90 where the prime represents the differentiation with respect to the conformal time , the subscript ` @xmath91 ' denotes the early time phase , and @xmath92 using general solutions for @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we obtain normalized solutions  @xcite , @xmath95 here we adjusted the integration constants for the solutions @xmath93 and @xmath94 to get the bunch - davis vacua in @xmath96 limit , @xmath97    as we see in , effective wave numbers for oscillation modes @xmath93 and @xmath94 at early time are @xmath98 and @xmath99 which are deformed from the wave number @xmath70 due to the non - vanishing value of @xmath29 .",
    "then we find that there is minimum value of the comoving wave number @xmath70 .",
    "the modes below the minimum value always stay in super horizon scale and never cross the horizon , so those modes do not contribute to current observable quantities .",
    "now we try to obtain the minimum value of the wave number .",
    "as we will see later , the leading contribution to the power spectrum comes from @xmath93 mode in the limit we are considering .",
    "so we focus on the mode @xmath93 .",
    "horizon crossing condition for the mode @xmath93 at the early stage of inflation is given by @xmath100 and the corresponding conformal time @xmath101 is @xmath102 from this relation , we notice that at the early stage of inflation , the hubble crossing occurs only when perturbation modes satisfy the condition to give a real value of @xmath101 , @xmath103 this condition determines the minimum value of the comoving wave number , @xmath104 in the current observation for perturbation modes , the minimum comoving wave number is in the range @xmath105 .",
    "due to this fact , one can roughly estimate the value of @xmath29 as @xmath106      on the other hand , in the late time satisfying the condition @xmath107 , one can express the scalar modes @xmath55 and @xmath56 in terms of the gauge invariant variables , @xmath77 and @xmath78 from the constrain , @xmath108 using , one can easily see that the coefficient of the @xmath55-dependent term in the first line of is belonged to higher order for slow - roll parameters . for this reason ,",
    "the differential equations for @xmath77 and @xmath78 are decoupled in the leading contribution of slow - roll parameters .",
    "then we obtain differential equations for @xmath109 and @xmath110 in the conformal time coordinate as @xmath111 where the subscript ` @xmath112 ' denotes the late time phase and @xmath113 here the slow - roll parameters , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , are defined as @xmath116 general solutions of @xmath109 and @xmath110 modes for differential equations in are given by @xmath117 where @xmath118 ( @xmath119 ) are the first and second kinds of the hankel functions and @xmath120 are integration constants .",
    "as we discussed in the previous section , there are two phases in our model and we obtained perturbation modes for each phase separately . then all perturbed modes should satisfy matching conditions at the transition point @xmath121 in conformal time , @xmath122 here we notice that the perturbed modes @xmath88 and @xmath89 satisfy the same type of differential equations with different parameters .",
    "so in what follows , we only consider the matching condition for the mode @xmath88 .",
    "then the results can be extended to the case of the mode @xmath89 as well . from the matching condition in we obtain the corresponding integration constants , @xmath123   \\ , , { \\nonumber}\\\\ c_1+c_2 = & { -ie^{-i\\beta\\tau_{eq}}\\sqrt{\\pi }   \\over   \\sqrt{2 } \\,k\\sqrt{-k_{e1}\\tau_{eq } } } \\biggr[(k_{e1}+i \\alpha m_{{\\rm p}})k_{l1}\\tau_{eq}y_{\\mu_1 -1 } { \\nonumber}\\\\ & ~+\\left ( \\left(k_{e1}+i \\alpha m_{{\\rm p}}\\right ) \\left(\\mu-{1\\over2}\\right ) + \\left(i \\alpha^2 m_{{\\rm p}}^2 + 2\\alpha k_{e1 } m_{{\\rm p}}-2ik_{e1}^2\\right)\\tau_{eq } \\right)y_{\\mu_1 } \\biggr ]   \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we used the relations between the hankel functions and bessel functions , @xmath124 and defined the quantities at the transition point as @xmath125",
    "now we try to obtain the power spectrum for the curvature perturbation @xmath126 in and related observational quantities . for a single scalar model ,",
    "one usually reads the power spectrum at the horizon crossing point since it is guaranteed in the absence of the transition point that curvature perturbations of perturbed modes are frozen after the horizon crossing . in our case with two inflationary phases , however , reading",
    "the power spectrum at the horizon crossing point can cause some possible errors for large scale modes which are deformed due to the presence of the nonvanishing @xmath29-term .",
    "that is , one can not guarantee the freezing of the curvature perturbation after the horizon crossing for large scale modes .",
    "for this reason , we read the power spectrum at the limit @xmath127 for all values in the region @xmath128 .    using the relation in the limit @xmath129",
    ", we obtain leading contributions for the curvature perturbation  @xcite , @xmath130 as we see in , the comoving wave number has a minimum value , and so we notice that all comoving wave numbers relevant to the observation are in the range @xmath131 . due to this fact , from now",
    "on we neglect the contribution of @xmath132 in by keeping the leading contribution of @xmath133 since the @xmath132-term in gives @xmath134 contribution to the the resulting power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "then the power spectrum of the curvature perturbation is given by @xmath135 where the subscripted asterisk indicates the value at the horizon crossing point @xmath136 and we take the late time limit @xmath137 to read the power spectrum . plugging the first line of into , we obtain @xmath138 where @xmath139 denotes the power spectrum of the canonical single inflation model , @xmath140 here , @xmath141 with the euler - mascheroni constant @xmath142 and @xmath143,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath144 .",
    "[ 0.80][fig2 ]    as discussed previously , we notice that during the early time phase , modes satisfying the condition @xmath145 can only cross the hubble horizon . in other words , modes in the range @xmath146 stay outside the hubble horizon and never cross the horizon .",
    "therefore , those super horizon modes are causally disconnected to our universe and irrelevant to observational quantities . as we see the plot of power spectrum in fig.2 , the power spectrum in our model asymptotically",
    "approaches that of the single field model ( dashed blue line ) by increasing the comoving wave number @xmath70 , while it is strongly suppressed by decreasing the value @xmath70 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the behaviour of power spectrum in terms of the value @xmath70 . to do that",
    ", we divide the values of @xmath70 into two regions , @xmath147 and @xmath148 . at first in the region @xmath147 , from we have the following asymptotic form of power spectrum @xmath149 . \\label{resultpps2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the power spectrum is almost scale invariant but modulated with small oscillation .",
    "this oscillation behaviour of power spectrum was also reported in different inflation model with phase transition  @xcite . the corresponding spectral index @xmath150 and the running of the spectral index @xmath151 at the pivot scale @xmath152 in the leading order of @xmath153 with small slow - roll parameters are given by @xmath154 where @xmath155 denotes the spectral index at the pivot scale @xmath152 for the single field inflation model .",
    "we notice that the spectral index is slightly increasing and the running is negative and slightly decreasing by decreasing the value @xmath70 due to the spatial condensation . on the other hand for the region @xmath148",
    ", we obtain the behaviour of the power spectrum as @xmath156 this behaviour was plotted in fig.2 in terms of the red line in logarithmic scale of the wave number .",
    "then the corresponding spectral index and its running are given by @xmath157 from this behaviour of the power spectrum in the spatial condensation , one can clearly notice a strong suppression of the scalar power spectrum on large scales .",
    "since the spectral index is approaching a constant on these large scale limit , the running of the spectral index becomes almost zero .",
    "we analysed the behaviour of the power spectrum in terms of semi - analytic methods for large scales @xmath148 and small scales @xmath147 in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , as we see the numerical result shown in fig.2 , there is a sudden transition of the power spectrum for intermediate scales between @xmath148 and @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , for this region , the spectral index is growing suddenly by decreasing the comoving wave number , i.e. , the scalar power spectrum starts to be suppressed strongly , and then one has large negative running of the spectral index in the intermediate region .",
    "there are several models to accomplish the suppression .",
    "one common property of these models is that there exists a phase transition of the background evolution and it is connected to the slow - roll phase of the single field inflation model at late time . in this paper",
    ", we showed that a deformed single field inflation model in terms of _ the spatial condensation _ has a phase transition which is similar to that of models in @xcite and the suppression of scalar power spectrum on large scales .",
    "we deformed a single field inflation model in terms of three so(3 ) symmetric moduli fields @xmath16 .",
    "on the solution with constant gradient @xmath158 , the background evolution is equivalent to that of the single inflation model with curvature term of the open universe . during very early time",
    ", the background evolution is governed by the curvature term but soon after the curvature term is rapidly decreased .",
    "then at the late time , the evolution is governed by the potential term of the single scalar field and asymptotically approaches that of a single field inflation model .",
    "this means that there exists a phase transition of the background evolution , and so , for an analytic approach we divided the background evolution into two phases , the @xmath29-term dominant phase and the potential term dominant phase .    during the @xmath29-term dominant phase",
    ", we assumed that the inflation started with a very large value of the @xmath29-term ( curvature term ) and then the e - folding could be accumulated very rapidly .",
    "therefore , during the early time phase with a short cosmic time process , the single scalar field remains almost constant .",
    "assuming the scalar potential is a constant , there is an exact solution governing the background evolution . on the other hand , in the late time phase",
    ", the @xmath29-term becomes very small and the evolution is governed by the potential term and asymptotically approaches that of the single field inflation . under the slow - roll assumption ,",
    "the system is governed by slow - roll parameters and small contribution of the @xmath29-term .    under the above circumstance of the background evolution , we investigated the behaviour scalar modes in linear perturbation level .",
    "we considered the perturbation modes in the early and late time phases separately .",
    "for perturbed modes in the two phases , we applied the junction condition at the transition point .",
    "then we obtained the power spectrum , the spectral index , and the running of the spectral index for scalar modes .",
    "we found that the power spectrum is apparently suppressed by decreasing the comoving wave number , while it approaches the value of the single field inflation model for large value of the comoving wave number .",
    "therefore , one can obtain large negative running of the scalar spectral index on large scales .",
    "we also found a oscillation behaviour of the power spectrum at late time .",
    "we focused on the suppression of the scalar power spectrum on large scales .",
    "however , we also expect that there will be a nontrivial contribution to the isocurvature perturbation since our model has two perturbed scalar modes .",
    "actually our model introduces a free gradient parameter @xmath29 to a single field inflation model in isotropic and homogeneous way .",
    "therefore , in order to accommodate observational data , similar analysis as we did in this paper can be applied to various inflation models by adjusting the free parameter @xmath29 .",
