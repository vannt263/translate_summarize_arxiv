    "the lg potentials ( [ lgpot ] ) appear also in the description of the relevant perturbations of virasoro minimal models of conformal field theory @xcite , as well as of the renormalization group flows between them .",
    "the physical quantities associated with a field theory  partition function , energy spectrum , correlation functions , etc .  strongly depend on the geometry of the considered problem ( cylindrical , strip , plane , etc . ) , on the boundary conditions chosen ( periodic , dirichlet , etc . ) and on the range of the values of the couplings @xmath5 . for several integrable quantum field theories in 2d ,",
    "the above quantities have been exactly computed in finite volume with the so - called thermodynamics bethe ansatz method @xcite or destri  devega equations @xcite .",
    "these techniques , however , require the integrability of the model , and can not be applied to the lg theories ( [ lgpot ] ) , due to their non  integrable nature . in this case , the analysis of the finite  size effects is based on approximative methods as perturbative renormalization group ( see @xcite and references therein ) , transfer integral techniques @xcite and numerical methods .    the low temperature ( broken symmetry ) phase of these models exhibits , however , specific features  multiple degenerate vacua , non  trivial topological sectors and non  perturbative kink solutions ( domain walls )  which require certain improvements of the standard perturbative methods .",
    "the non  perturbative semiclassical expansion @xcite is known to be an effective method for the quantization of the kink solutions in an infinite volume , independently of the integrability of the model .",
    "its recent extension to finite geometries @xcite allowed us to derive analytic expressions for the scaling functions of the sine  gordon model defined on a cylinder with quasi",
    " periodic b.c .",
    "( i.e. in the one  kink sector ) and on a strip with dirichlet b.c.s .",
    "it is then natural to address the problem of the finite  size effects in 2d lg models within the context of the semiclassical quantization of kinks in finite volume .",
    "the present paper is devoted to the derivation of the scaling functions of the 2d @xmath0 theory on a cylindrical geometry with _ antiperiodic _ b.c .",

    "this continues our analysis of finite - size effects in the @xmath0 model , which begun in @xcite with the derivation of the finite  volume form factors and spectral functions for the same kind of geometry .    from the mathematical point of view , the derivation of the scaling functions for the @xmath0 theory on the _ twisted _ cylinder is analogous to the one performed in @xcite for the sine ",
    "gordon model on a cylinder with _ quasi - periodic _",
    "b.c .. this is due to the fact that the finite volume kinks are expressed in both cases in terms of a jacobi elliptic function , and the computation of the corresponding energy levels is therefore based on the solution of the so  called lam equation .",
    "besides a minor technical difference ( the equation appears now in a more complicated form , the so",
    " called @xmath7 lam form ) , an important new feature emerges in the antiperiodic case : the oscillating background can not be defined for any value of the size of the system , so that the complete description of the problem is achieved in this case by also including a constant background below a specific value of the size .    our main result , presented in sect.[sectphi4 ] , consists in the analytic expression of the kink scaling functions ( for arbitrary value of the size of the system @xmath8 ) , which describes the flow between the twisted sector of @xmath1 cft in the uv region and the massive particles in the @xmath9 topological sectors of the broken @xmath0 theory in the infrared ( ir ) limit .",
    "this section also includes a comparison between the large@xmath8 corrections to the kink masses , as obtained from the ir asymptotic behaviour of the scaling functions , and the values expected from the infinite  volume scattering data through luscher s theory @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of the uv regime is left to sect.[sectkinkop ] .",
    "here we analyse the properties of the @xmath1 cft fields that play the role of creating operators for the @xmath0 kinks , as well as of the kinks of generic lg models .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath10invariant polynomial potentials ( in their broken phase ) the disorder field @xmath11 of dimension @xmath12 ( and its descendants ) from the twisted sector of the @xmath1 cft are the only operators local with respect to the potential and carrying topological ( @xmath10 ) charges .",
    "therefore they must describe the uv limit of the lg  kinks .",
    "sect.[sectkinkop ] actually begins with the more familiar discussion of soliton  creating operators for the sine - gordon model in the winding ( i.e. quasiperiodic ) sector . due to the compactification of the field , indeed , this theory admits more types of b.c .",
    ", including the antiperiodic ones .",
    "we have then devoted sect.[sectsg ] to the analysis of this interestingly rich model , which displays two types of non - trivial classical solutions in finite volume , respecting two different b.c.s ( quasiperiodic and antiperiodic ) .",
    "their uv limits are described , respectively , by the standard soliton  creating operators from the winding sector of @xmath1 cft and by the disorder field in its twisted sector , i.e. that one which creates the @xmath10 charged kinks .",
    "the two corresponding types of scaling functions are given explicitly , and their difference is observed at any finite volume , except for their identical ir limits .",
    "it is therefore clear that passing from periodic to @xmath10symmetric polynomial potentials only the kink  type ( antiperiodic ) solution survives , which explain why the finite volume kink  type solutions of sg and @xmath0 models ( as well as their uv limits ) share many common properties .",
    "the explicit analytic form obtained in the present paper for the scaling functions of the @xmath0 model ( and in previous works @xcite for the sine  gordon model ) is intrinsically related to the fact that the stability equations to be solved are of lam type , and the corresponding solutions are well known . as we shall show in sect.[sectphin ] , similar construction for @xmath4 and higher ( @xmath13 ) lg models leads again to schrdinger  like equations for periodic potentials , but it turns out that these are more complicated generalizations of the lam equation .",
    "the derivation of the finite  volume energy spectrum of these models thus depends on the further progress that will be achieved in the future on their analytical or numerical solutions .",
    "the standard perturbative methods of qft s in @xmath14-dimensions ( including the @xmath15 case we are interested in ) are known to be inefficient for the description of the quantum effects in the topologically non  trivial sectors of an important class of theories with non  linear interactions and multiple degenerate vacua . as a rule ,",
    "such theories admit finite  energy non  perturbative classical solutions ( kinks , vortices , monopoles etc . ) carrying topological charges .",
    "the quantization of these solutions ( both static and time ",
    "dependent ) requires non  perturbative techniques , developed by dashen , hasslacher and neveu ( dhn ) in @xcite for theories in infinite volume .",
    "the dhn method consists , for static backgrounds , in splitting the field @xmath16 in terms of the classical solution and its quantum fluctuations , i.e. @xmath17 and in further expanding the lagrangian of the theory in powers of @xmath18 , keeping only the quadratic terms . as a result of this procedure",

    "in fact , this kind of background , regarded however as a time ",
    "dependent solution in zero space dimensions , has been proposed in @xcite to describe dominating contributions to the partition function at finite temperature @xmath111 , i.e. when the euclidean time variable is compactified on a circumference @xmath112 with _ periodic _ b.c .. in this case , the finite value of @xmath111 which corresponds to @xmath113 is naturally interpreted as a limiting temperature , above which no periodic solutions exist .",

    "their imaginary contributions to the energy levels indicate the instability of the considered background , which is explained in @xcite by noting that in the @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) limit the solution tends to a single kink , instead of keeping its periodic nature of a train of kinks and antikinks .",
    "all this reflects the ambiguity present in the definition of the size of the system @xmath8 in terms of the elliptic modulus @xmath60 , simply due to the periodicity of the jacobi function @xmath119 , and correspondingly in the interpretation of the solution for a chosen definition of @xmath8 .",
    "however , choosing ( [ sizephi4 ] ) , i.e. _ antiperiodic _ b.c . , the infinite volume limit is smoothly recovered as @xmath117 , and the corresponding single kink solution is stable .",
    "it is then natural to expect that for any value of @xmath8 of the finite system , also time ",
    "dependent solution exist , which describe multikink or kink  antikink configurations .",
    "such solutions can be quantized in finite volume as well , although this is a subject that is out of the scope of the present paper .",
    "finally , in the recent paper @xcite the orbifold geometry @xmath120 is considered , instead of the circle , for the worldsheet space coordinate @xmath121 , and a classical background very similar to ( [ phi4kinkcomplete ] ) is introduced . the analogy with our case ,",
    "however , is only apparent .",
    "in fact , due to the absence of translational invariance , on the orbifold the kink and the antikink have to be considered as two distinct degenerate solutions , suggesting therefore a phase transition at @xmath87 . in our case ,",
    "on the contrary , the lowest energy level is never degenerate , consistently with the fact that the behavior of the scaling functions at @xmath87 does not hint at any underlying conformal field theory .",
    "the discontinuity of the derivative of @xmath122 at @xmath87 should be then interpreted as just an effect of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "as it is well known , starting from @xmath1 cft in two dimensions and adding to its lagrangian different relevant operators with an appropriate choice of the coupling constants , one can construct many integrable and non - integrable 2d massive qft s having degenerate vacua @xcite .",
    "they can be classified according to the symmetries preserved by the perturbation .",
