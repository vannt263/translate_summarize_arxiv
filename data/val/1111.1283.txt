    "the rayleigh - taylor instability  @xcite ( rti ) is an instability of an interface between two fluids in a metastable state . for instance ,",
    "when a layer of a heavier fluid is laid on a lighter fluid , the system is energetically unfavorable and the two fluids tend to exchange their positions .",
    "however , if the two fluids are immiscible and their interface is flat , the exchange can not occur without breaking the translation symmetry of the interface .",
    "once an infinitesimal modulation arises on the interface , it exponentially grows due to the rti , and the interface develops into complicated patterns such as a mushroom - shaped pattern .",
    "this kind of phenomena is found through nature in a wide scale ranging from laboratory to astronomical scales  @xcite .",
    "recently , the rti was predicted to be observed in a two - component bose - einstein condensate ( bec )  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a two - component bec trapped in a tight pancake - shaped trap is considered , in which the two components separate into two semicircular shapes in the trap . when an external force is applied to each component in the direction to the other component , the rti sets in and the interface deforms into a mushroom - shaped pattern . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the initial state of a two - component bec forms a domain structure in the axial direction of a cigar - shaped trap .",
    "the interaction between atoms in one component is then increased , and the rti arises at the domain wall .",
    "the rti is a symmetry breaking phenomenon , that is , even when the interface has symmetry ( e.g. the translation symmetry of a flat interface ) an infinitesimal modulation grows exponentially and the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "however , in the above mentioned studies in refs .",
    "@xcite , the symmetry breaking can not be observed explicitly , since the relevant symmetry is broken from the initial state : the interfaces have edges or rims and have no translation symmetry .",
    "the inhomogeneous interfaces of the initial state strongly affects the deformation dynamics of the interfaces , obscuring the symmetry breaking nature of the rti .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a system to observe the symmetry breaking rti for a trapped two - component bec .",
    "we consider a two - component bec with rotation symmetry , in which the two components separate radially and a `` bubble '' of inner component is surrounded by a shell of outer component .",
    "the interface between the two components has a spherical shape for an isotropic trap and a circular shape for a quasi-2d axisymmetric trap .",
    "if we change a parameter in such a way that the inner component tends to go out of the outer shell component , the rti breaks the rotation symmetry of the interface and the spherical or circular interface is deformed into various patterns .",
    "the symmetry breaking rti can thus be realized in a trapped bec .",
    "the rti that breaks rotation symmetry occurs in a variety of systems , such as supernova explosion  @xcite , imploding targets in inertial - confinement fusion  @xcite , and collapsing cavitation bubbles  @xcite .",
