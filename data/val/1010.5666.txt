    "the standard set - up for a quantum dot consists of a small quantum system described by a finite - dimensional hilbert space which is coupled to several infinitely large reservoirs via energy and/or particle exchange .",
    "a difference in the chemical potentials of the reservoirs will generically lead to particle transport and thus a finite current through the dot . here",
    "we will study the arguably simplest but non - trivial quantum dot system , namely the interacting resonant level model ( irlm ) .",
    "it is given by a local level coupled to two leads of non - interacting spinless fermions .",
    "the fermions can hop on and off the level .",
    "in addition , there is a coulomb interaction between the level and the reservoirs ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the irlm constitutes the minimal model for a quantum dot dominated by charge fluctuations as spin degrees of freedom are not taken into account .",
    "originally the ( one - lead ) irlm was introduced independently by wiegmann and finkelstein  @xcite as well as schlottmann  @xcite to study the anisotropic kondo model .",
    "they generalized earlier works by anderson et al .",
    "@xcite at the toulouse point  @xcite , where the coulomb interaction between the level and the reservoir vanishes .",
    "in particular , in refs .",
    "it was shown that the irlm and the anisotropic kondo model possess the same partition function in the so - called long - time approximation and thus share the same universal low - temperature characteristics .",
    "equilibrium properties like the static and dynamic susceptibilities and the relaxation rate of the irlm have been intensively studied in the early 1980 s using the bethe ansatz  @xcite as well as renormalization group ( rg ) techniques  @xcite .",
    "the equivalence between the irlm and the anisotropic kondo model can be shown by bosonization and refermionization of the latter model  @xcite .",
    "recently the interest in the irlm has been revived as a minimal model to describe non - equilibrium transport through quantum dots .",
    "initialized by the work of mehta and andrei  @xcite the model has been investigated using the hershfield @xmath0-operator  @xcite , keldysh perturbation  @xcite and scattering theory  @xcite , field theory approaches  @xcite , the numerical renormalization group method ( nrg )  @xcite and the time - dependent density matrix renormalization group technique ( td - dmrg )  @xcite .",
    "most of these studies were performed at the special point of particle - hole and left - right symmetry .",
    "the quantity of main interest has been the steady - state current through the resonant level .",
    "the main conclusions were that ( i ) at sufficiently large bias voltages a negative differential conductance appears , and that ( ii ) in the scaling limit , where all bare energy scales are much smaller than the bandwidth of the leads , the current decreases as a power law in the applied voltage .",
    "however , only at the self - dual point  @xcite it has been possible to derive closed analytic expressions for the current as a function of the applied voltage .",
    "recently , perturbative rg techniques in non - equilibrium  @xcite have been applied to obtain more insight into the physics of the irlm at finite bias . in ref .",
    "a poor man scaling analysis has been performed up to next - to - leading order providing power - law exponents up to second order in the coulomb interaction . in a non - equilibrium situation",
    ", the rg flow was cut off heuristically by the voltage which induced an emergent power - law behavior of the current as a function of the voltage .",
    "subsequently , this analysis has been put on a more firm basis by the application of recently developed rg methods in non - equilibrium , the functional rg @xcite and the real - time rg method @xcite , see ref .   for a recent review .",
    "a short summary of the main results of the two methods for the irlm has been presented in ref .  , where a leading order expansion has been performed giving rise to power - law exponents linear in the coulomb interaction .",
    "the results were compared to numerically exact nrg and dmrg methods and a good agreement has been observed for moderate coulomb interactions . in particular , the conclusion was drawn that power - law behavior does not take place in the generic case of asymmetric coulomb interactions between the dot and the left and right reservoir .",
    "in addition , the scaling behavior at resonances away from the particle - hole symmetric point has been reexamined  @xcite .",
    "details of the functional rg method have been presented in ref .  .",
    "in this paper we will present an extended version of ref .   concerning the real - time rg method , supplemented by a generic treatment of strong charge fluctuations , a next - to - leading order analysis in the coulomb interaction and a new result concerning power laws as function of the level position away from the particle - hole symmetric point .",
    "the real - time renormalization group in frequency space ( rtrg - fs )  @xcite has recently been introduced in the theory of dissipative quantum systems .",
    "it provides a powerful tool in the description of non - equilibrium transport , in particular the relaxation and decoherence rates naturally arise within the proposed formalism .",
    "previous applications to the kondo model  @xcite in the weak coupling regime are here generalized to include charge fluctuations in strong coupling . to this end",
    "we develop rg equations , where we expand all quantities around zero matsubara frequency , in contrast to previous treatments @xcite , where a systematic expansion around the poor man scaling solution has been performed .",
    "the rg equations are set up in a generic form , which can also be used for other models with strong charge fluctuations .",
    "in particular , for the irlm we demonstrate that this scheme allows the study of observables close to resonances where the tunneling rate is the only relevant energy scale quantifying charge fluctuations .",
    "furthermore , we extend the analysis in ref .   by including subleading terms , which gives the exponents of power laws consistently up to second order in the coulomb interaction .",
    "a corresponding comparison of the power - law exponent with nrg results for the charge susceptibility in equilibrium at the particle - hole symmetric point yields excellent agreement .",
    "we present approximate analytical solutions which are confirmed by numerically integrating the corresponding full rg equations and which describe the steady state as well as the quench dynamics for arbitrary system parameters .",
    "thereby various microscopic cutoff scales of the rg flow can be identified , which is essential for the precise determination of the scaling behavior of observables . in particular , we derive closed analytic expressions for the charge susceptibility , the steady - state current and the differential conductance .",
    "we find ( i ) a negative differential conductance for arbitrary system parameters , ( ii ) that for asymmetric coulomb interactions the current does in general not follow a power law as a function of the bias and is recovered only in the limit of extremely large voltages , ( iii ) that at resonance , i.e. when the level position is aligned with one of the fermi levels in the leads , the current does not follow a power law even in the symmetric model , and ( iv ) that the current or the linear conductance reveals a power law as function of the level position in the generic case , i.e. even for asymmetric coulomb interactions and/or asymmetric tunneling couplings .",
    "the latter result was not reported in ref .  .",
    "in addition , we use the analytical solution of the rg equations to study the quench dynamics in the irlm , where we assume the couplings to the leads to be switched on suddenly .",
    "we derive closed integral representations for the resulting time evolution of the dot occupation and the current .",
    "the most notable characteristics of the time evolution of both observables are : ( i ) the relaxation towards the stationary values is governed by two different decay rates describing the charge relaxation on the level and its broadening induced by the coupling to the leads , respectively , ( ii ) the voltage appears as an important energy scale for the dynamics setting the frequency of an oscillatory behavior , and ( iii ) the exponential decay is accompanied by an algebraic behavior with an interaction - dependent exponent .",
    "similar results have been obtained recently for the dynamics of the non - equilibrium kondo model  @xcite , showing that these features are generic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we introduce the irlm and discuss its description in liouville space . in section  [ sec : rg ] we summarize and solve the rg equations . in section  [ sec : res ] we present the results for steady - state quantities as well as for the time evolution .",
    "here we also provide a simple derivation of the appearance of the negative differential conductance .",

    "in particular , in the presence of both spin and charge fluctuations , as e.g. in the non - equilibrium anderson model , the level position itself becomes renormalized and it is still an open question what the precise line shape of resonances looks like . whereas strong charge fluctuations at resonances seem to be described by the rtrg - fs method , an open question remains whether strong spin or orbital fluctuations can be covered as well . in both cases , a single energy scale dominates the physics and cuts off the rg flow .",
