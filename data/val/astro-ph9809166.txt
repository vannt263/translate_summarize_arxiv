    "new generation of large telescopes enables to study the intergalactic and interstellar absorbing gas with high instrumental resolutions sufficient to resolve absorption features into the individual subcomponents . from absorption - line spectra ,",
    "one usually estimates the column densities of absorbing species , @xmath5 , the doppler @xmath6-parameter of the diffuse gas , and the positions ( i.e. radial velocities ) of the subcomponents which are traditionally considered as being caused by the intervening ` clouds ' .",
    "the observations show the ubiquitous asymmetry of the line profiles ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 ; huang _ et al .",

    "_ 1996 ; prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) .",
    "their widths are believed to reflect the sum of thermal and non thermal ( ` bulk ' or ` turbulent ' ) motion .",
    "it should be noted that the term ` turbulent ' used in spectroscopy is less distinct as compared with hydrodynamic turbulence and labels the _ lack _ of information about the nature of the broadening mechanism ( traving 1975 ) .",
    "therefore to treat observations a model of the line broadening is to be specified first of all .",
    "it is a commonly used assumption that both thermal and turbulent velocities along a given line of sight can be represented by gaussian distributions , i.e. thermal and non thermal broadening can be added quadratically @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the rms turbulent velocity and @xmath9 is the thermal velocity @xmath10 where @xmath11 is boltzman s constant , @xmath12 is the mass of the element , and @xmath13 the kinetic temperature .    to separate the contribution of thermal and turbulent motion one",
    "usually utilizes the line profiles of different elements assuming that they have the same temperature and the velocity distribution within the individual components .",
    "if this is the case , then higher mass elements should have lower apparent @xmath6-values provided the measurements have a sufficiently high spectral resolution . with such reservations one can solve equation  ( [ eq : e1 ] ) for @xmath13 and @xmath8 for different species",
    ".    applied to the real absorption - line spectra , this technique often leads , however , to the implausible wide range of @xmath13 among individual ` cloudlets ' yielding for some of them even unphysical negative kinetic temperatures  clearly an absurdity ( spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 , 1995 ; fitzpatrick & spitzer 1997 ; tripp , lu & savage 1997 ) .",
    "this suggests that in general the problem of the @xmath6-parameter measurement from the interstellar and/or quasar metal absorption - line spectra is _ far from being solved_.    to a certain extent this problem is connected with the interpretation of complex absorption features as being caused mainly by the density fluctuations .",
    "however , as shown by levshakov & kegel ( 1997 ) the intensity fluctuations within the line profile can occur due to correlation effects in the large scale velocity field even for the homogeneous gas density .",
    "the present paper is primarily aimed at the problem of the kinetic temperature measurement accounting for these correlation effects .",
    "the analysis employs absorption profiles of two species with different atomic weights .",
    "these profiles are considered to arise in a transparent absorbing region of thickness @xmath14 with a correlated velocity field and a homogeneous temperature @xmath13 .",
    "although in principle density fluctuations can be incorporated , here we confine ourselves to the case of the homogeneous gas density and , hence , the density ratio of the chosen elements is constant along the line of sight .",
    "these conditions yield the similarity in the observed profiles of different elements ( examples can be found in spitzer & fitzpatrick 1993 , or in songaila 1998 ) .",
    "the assumption of constant @xmath13 is supported by the fact that the states of thermally stable , optically thin interstellar gas take only limited temperature ranges over a relatively wide range of density variations ( see , e.g. , figure  8.9 in shu 1992 ) .",
    "the entropy - regularized @xmath0-minimization ( the erm method ) we propose allows a robust measurement of a single value of @xmath13 from the multicomponent ( complex ) absorption spectra in cases where the standard voigt - profile fitting procedure yields different values of @xmath13 for the different subcomponents .",
    "the description of our model and its basic assumptions is given in   2 .",
    "a study of the accuracy of the method is provided through a series of numerical simulations of complex spectra produced in the correlated velocity fields of different structure which is presented in   3 .",
    "we proceed further in this approach with high resolution c  ii@xmath2 and fe  ii@xmath15 synthetic spectra in   4 , in order to derive the gas temperature and to compare its value with the standard voigt fitting procedure yield . an example based on real observations of high - redshifted metal absorption lines",
    "is presented in this section as well .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in   5 .",
    "in this section we present a compendium of the standard radiative transfer equations describing pure absorption in spectral lines , and the consecutive analytical technique to derive the @xmath13-estimation and the radial - velocity distribution function @xmath16 from the line profiles of two elements with different atomic weights . here",
    ", we are dealing with noiseless data , assuming that the given spectra are exact .",
    "if the interstellar ( intergalactic ) absorption line is optically thin , one observes directly the apparent optical depth @xmath17 as function of wavelength @xmath18 @xmath19\\ : , \\label{eq : e4}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the intensities with and without the absorption , respectively .",
    "the recorded spectrum is a convolution of the true spectrum and the spectrograph point - spread function @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the true ( intrinsic ) optical depth .",
    "the intensity of the background continuum source @xmath21 changes usually very slowly over the width of the spectrograph function , and hence  ( [ eq : e5 ] ) becomes @xmath25    for the following it is convenient to change from @xmath18-space to the radial - velocity @xmath26-space .",
    "further , let the line - absorption coefficient reckoned per atom ( the absorption cross - section ) at radial velocity @xmath26 within the line profile be denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "then the optical depth at velocity @xmath26 is @xmath28    for the case of unsaturated absorption lines when the effect of radiation damping is negligible @xmath27 may be described by the doppler kernel of the voigt function ( spitzer 1978 ) . then the profile function is defined _ locally _ by the thermal broadening , i.e. the linewidth is determined by the kinetic temperature only ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "now @xmath27 can be expressed as the product of a constant @xmath30 for a particular line and the gaussian line profile function @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mass and charge of the electron , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the oscillator strength and the wavelength of the line center at which the corresponding radial velocity is equal to @xmath37 .",
    "if atoms are involved in both thermal and hydrodynamic motions and the temperature is constant along the line of sight , then the total line profile function is a convolution of @xmath31 and the radial - velocity distribution function @xmath38 caused by bulk motion @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "both functions @xmath16 and @xmath41 are normalized so that @xmath42 . in principle , @xmath16 reflects the density fluctuations as well , and in reality is the density weighted radial - velocity distribution .",
    "but while we are dealing with the similar profiles the explicit treatment of the density fluctuations can be avoided .",
    "the instrumental point - spread function @xmath22 can be determined experimentally , whereas @xmath16 and @xmath41 are the two contributions of astrophysical interest .",
    "we now consider how to measure the kinetic temperature @xmath13 from the complex profiles of a pair of elements with different masses .",
    "it is a task to deconvolve the thermal and the turbulent profiles both of which are unknown a priori .",
    "we are mainly interested in cases when line profiles are dominated by non thermal broadening , @xmath43 , otherwise the problem is trivial .",
    "let us assume that two ions have different masses , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "for a fixed value of @xmath26 within the line profile the optical depth is given according to  ( [ eq : e7]-[eq : e9 ] ) by @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "this equation is a convolution of two functions .",
    "its fourier transform is @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the fourier transforms of the line profile function @xmath51 and the radial - velocity distribution function @xmath52 , respectively .    if the chosen ions trace the _ same _ volume elements and the ionization fraction is _ equal _ for both of them ( this assumption may not be universally true for any pair of ions but is expected to be valid for ions with similar ionization potentials ) , then @xmath53 .",
    "in this case two fourier transforms @xmath54 and @xmath55 yield the _ exact _ equations relating the line shapes in the fourier space to the kinetic temperature _ independently _ of the velocity and density fluctuations along a given line of sight  : @xmath56 & = &   \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1 } { \\rm e}^{q^2 \\pi^2 ( v^2_{\\rm th,1}-v^2_{\\rm th,2 } ) } \\equiv \\frac{\\omega_2}{\\omega_1 } { \\rm e}^{a t q^2 \\pi^2}\\ : , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the first step is to determine the fourier transforms @xmath58 and @xmath59 . the most appropriate way would be to represent @xmath60 by a set of functions which have analytical fourier transform .",
    "we have chosen gaussian functions since irregular doppler shifts of the local absorption coefficient ( [ eq : e8 ] ) along the sightline , yielding the apparent complexity of the line profiles , result in a mixture of gaussians ( [ eq : e9 ] ) .",
    "the line profiles are modeled using the following sum of gaussians @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the number of modes and @xmath63 and @xmath64 are their weights . since basic assumptions of our method",
    "lead to the similarity of both profiles , we may set the number of modes and their centers to be identical , i.e. @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "all modes describing the individual profile have the same dispersion , denoted @xmath67 for the first profile and @xmath68 for the second , with @xmath69 .",
    "the choice of the equidispersion gaussians is by no way restrictive in our case because the modes in  ( [ eq : e13 ] ) are used only to describe the entire shape of each line profile and do not bear any physical sense as it is in the voigt profile fitting procedures .",
    "the number of modes @xmath62 is an arbitrary parameter and is determined by a satisfactory fit of @xmath70 and @xmath71 solely .",
    "the equidispersion modes with identical positions allow very easy to meet the second condition in  ( [ eq : e12 ] ) ,  zero imaginary part of the ratio @xmath72 ,  resulting in the requirement @xmath73 for all @xmath74 .",
    "it should be noted that the multi - gaussian model  ( [ eq : e13 ] ) is not the unique one to describe the shape of profiles .",
    "any other representations can be used as well .",
    "nevertheless the model  ( [ eq : e13 ] ) has been favored because of its clearness and easiness in realization .",
    "the similar profiles can be always fitted by using this model .",
    "and on the contrary , if the fitting according to  ( [ eq : e13 ] ) fails then the profiles are non - similar and hence our method can not be applied .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : e13 ] ) shows that the total number of free parameters to be found is equal to @xmath75 , and that @xmath76 can be calculated as @xmath77 with @xmath78 .    using expansion ( [ eq : e13 ] ) , the fourier transforms of the line profiles",
    "can be expressed as @xmath79    from equations  ( [ eq : e12][eq : e15 ] ) it follows that the kinetic temperature is determined by @xmath80    having estimated the kinetic temperature , the radial - velocity distribution function @xmath38 can be calculated through the inverse fourier transform @xmath81 of the function @xmath82 from equations  ( [ eq : e15 ] ) , ( [ eq : e17 ] ) and ( [ eq : e18 ] ) we can readily show that @xmath83\\ ; , \\ ; \\iota = 1\\ , { \\rm or}\\ , 2\\ ; .",
    "\\label{eq : e19}\\ ] ] although in our model @xmath67 and @xmath68 are arbitrary parameters without any physical meaning , their natural lower limits should not be smaller than the corresponding thermal widths , otherwise one may be trapped into the fitting of noise .",
    "then it follows that the ratio @xmath84 ranges between @xmath85 and 1 yielding @xmath86 for any parameter sets .",
    "in the foregoing section we formulated a method to derive the kinetic temperature by using the fourier transform technique .",
    "we have so far dealt with noiseless data .",
    "now we turn our attention to the case of noisy data .    to calculate @xmath13 from equation  ( [ eq : e16 ] ) we need first of all to estimate @xmath87 parameters of model defined by equation  ( [ eq : e13 ] )  : @xmath88 , where @xmath89",
    ". since we are primarily interested in the recovery of @xmath13 , another set of the parameters appears to be more convenient  : @xmath90 , with @xmath91 standing for a parameter vector .",
    "the standard @xmath0 minimization is used to estimate @xmath91  : @xmath92 ^ 2 \\ ; , \\label{eq : e20}\\ ] ] where @xmath93 is the simulated ( or observed ) normalized intensity within the @xmath94th pixel of the line profile and @xmath95 is the calculated intensity .",
    "both are convolved with the instrumental function @xmath22 .",
    "further , @xmath96 is a simulated ( or experimental ) error , @xmath97 is the number of pixels involved in the sum , and @xmath98 is the number of degrees of freedom . as already mentioned above the choice of the number of modes @xmath62 is somewhat arbitrary but the minimum number of @xmath62 is determined by the appropriate quality of the fit ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "model calculations with different synthetic spectra have shown , however , that the minimization according to  ( [ eq : e20 ] ) does not allow to recover the kinetic temperature with a sufficiently high accuracy ( say 10% ) .",
    "the deviations of the recovered temperature from its underlying value exceeded in some cases 100% .",
    "this failure is easy to understand  : our model for @xmath100 is constructed using several smoothing operators [ convolution with the instrumental function and summing in ( [ eq : e13 ] ) ] and , as a result , we have here a typical _ ill - posed _ problem ( see , e.g. , tikhonov & arsenin 1977 ) .",
    "parameters in ill - posed problems are known to be very sensitive to data perturbations , which results in the inappropriate large dispersions .",
    "the ill - posed problems often occur in the astronomical image reconstructions as well , and several methods have been developed to overcome this obstacle ( see wu 1997 and references cited therein ) . in order to stabilize the estimation of @xmath91 , we need to augment @xmath0 by a regularization term penalizing large values of parameters errors . applied to our particular problem this technique",
    "is described below .",
    "this section concerns the entropy - regularized @xmath0-minimization [ erm ] procedure developed to estimate the best fit value for the parameter vector @xmath91 . to begin with ,",
    "we formulate the erm method .",
    "then we state the problem in mathematical language .",
    "finally , we discuss some practical implementations .    instead of minimizing @xmath0",
    "defined in equation ( [ eq : e20 ] ) , we now seek for the minimum of another objective function @xmath101 where @xmath102 is a penalty function and @xmath103 the regularization parameter which is to be estimated . by minimizing  ( [ eq : e21 ] ) we find the most probable value of the parameter vector @xmath104 .",
    "the choice of @xmath102 , especially for nonlinear problems , occurs rather heuristically .",
    "since our purpose is to get the most accurate estimation of @xmath13 , it is reasonable to make @xmath102 penalize large error in temperature .",
    "having @xmath105 and @xmath106 the easiest choice will be @xmath107 which means that @xmath103 is in units of velocity .    in spite of its simplicity",
    "this function works quite effectively and enables us to locate the true value of temperature very closely .",
    "[ it should be noted that when we change the parameter set and make @xmath13 be a free variable , the form of the regularization term remains the same but with @xmath108 .",
    "this corresponds to the minimization of the relative error in @xmath67 ] .",
    "the determination of the optimal value of @xmath103 is the most crucial point in all regularization procedures .",
    "it remains an open question still for linear problems , although the method of lagrange multipliers , bayesian estimations and maximum entropy ( maxent ) concept proved to be very successful in many cases .",
    "optimality criterion applied for our problem is motivated by the idea of minimization of the cross - entropy which is in principle equivalent to the maxent approach ( wu 1997 ) . in detail",
    "our procedure is described as follows .",
    "since entropy is a probabilistic measure of the uncertainty of the information obtained , we will consider the parameter vector @xmath91 as a random variable with the probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath110 .",
    "in this notation index @xmath103 marks the pdf which corresponds to a given value of the regularization parameter @xmath103 .",
    "although @xmath110 may have in general a skew peak , we will assume that a gaussian distribution centered at @xmath104 captures most of the probability mass of the true pdf .",
    "then @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the error - covariance matrix .",
    "this matrix may be estimated through the matrix of second derivatives of @xmath113 according to its expansion into a taylor series in the vicinity of the minimum  : @xmath114 and @xmath115    if the errors are uncorrelated , equation  ( [ eq : e23 ] ) simplifies to the product of the individual parameter distributions  : @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the parameter dispersions .    to estimate exactly the level of @xmath119 that corresponds to the region containing a certain percentage ( say 68% = @xmath120 for normal distribution ) of the total probability we would need to carry out quite extensive monte - carlo simulations at each step of our iterative procedure .",
    "however , in order to estimate roughly the parameter dispersions we may use instead of @xmath121 the corresponding value of @xmath122 which is computed according to press _",
    "since the regularization term in @xmath119 is kept small as compared with the @xmath0 term , this estimation of the dispersions is expected not to deviate significantly from the true value .",
    "then the variances in  ( [ eq : e26 ] ) can be evaluated as @xmath123    the definition of the cross - entropy which is the distance between the two distributions @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( called also kullback measure ) is given by ( cf . ,",

    "now suppose that the optimal pdf @xmath128 is known .",
    "then to estimate the appropriate @xmath103-value we have to minimize the distance between @xmath129 and @xmath130 , i.e. the cross - entropy @xmath131 .",

    "\\label{eq : e29}\\ ] ]    in general we are not given a priori the optimal distribution , but we can construct it adaptively from the sequence of solutions obtained for successive values of @xmath103 ranging from @xmath133 to @xmath134 with a step of @xmath135 . using the estimation from the previous step as a current approximation for @xmath129",
    "we obtain the following iterative sequence  : @xmath136 .",
    "numerical experiments with synthetic spectra have shown that this sequence really converges to 0 .",
    "the optimum value of @xmath137 , i.e. the value for which the recovered @xmath138 was most close to the underlying @xmath13 used to produce the spectrum was found to coincide with the point where the curvature of the trajectory @xmath139 passed through the maximum ( cf .",
    "lucy 1994 ) .",
    "1 illustrates this behavior .",
    "as known , the curvature of the continuous curve @xmath140 is @xmath141 where dots indicate differentiation .",
    "it is obvious that the value of @xmath142 depends on the units in which @xmath143 and @xmath144 are measured .",
    "therefore in order to get uniform results we always computed @xmath142 for the values @xmath145 and @xmath103 normalized to 1 , i.e. in the coordinates @xmath146    the derivatives in  ( [ eq : e30 ] ) are computed numerically through the common finite differences : @xmath147 and @xmath148 . since numerical differentiation is rather sensitive to any even small uncertainties in the function values , to get the smooth distribution of @xmath142 we need to calculate the @xmath145 values with very high accuracy .",
    "this means that the minimization of @xmath149 is to be continued till the stable global minimum with @xmath150 is achieved .",
    "the approximation of @xmath151 with smoothing spline can be used as well to obtain the stable numerical derivatives .",
    "but it should be noted that if @xmath151 is computed with significant errors , then the smoothing spline may noticeably move the maximal curvature point to a wrong value of @xmath137 .",
    "thus the only way to derive the reliable estimation of @xmath137 ( and hence of @xmath13 ) is to carry out the calculations on each step of the procedure as accurate as possible .",
    "it should be pointed out before going ahead that we can test the estimated value of @xmath137 by using the intrinsic properties of the kullback measure . as noted above",
    ", cross - entropy is the non - symmetric measure , that is , @xmath152 .",
    "this property can be used to verify the obtained estimations in the following way  : we compute @xmath145-values for both upward @xmath153 and downward @xmath154 sequences and then estimate the corresponding optimal values of @xmath103 .",
    "their coincidence for both directions may be considered as a simple validity proof .",
    "another useful property is the non - additivity of the kullback measure , i.e. @xmath155 .",
    "it means that if the solution of the inverse problem does exist then the @xmath151-sequences should yield the same @xmath137-value independently of the step size @xmath135 .",
    "the limiting values of @xmath133 and @xmath134 should be chosen in such a way that the expected goodness - of - fit does not deteriorate strongly ( @xmath99 ) . although the natural choice of the minimum value seems to be @xmath156 , in some cases the @xmath103-sequence may be continued into the region of negative @xmath103 keeping inequality @xmath157 valid .",
    "the extension of the @xmath103-sequence below zero becomes especially essential step when the preliminary calculations reveal a low gradient @xmath151-curve over the whole interval @xmath158 $ ] indicating that the maximum curvature point lies outside .",
    "the method described makes it possible to recover the underlying kinetic temperature from spectra of different complexity and quality .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that the procedure yields only a ` best fit ' value for parameter(s ) without confidence intervals ( a point - like estimation ) since the dispersions obtained can be over- or underestimated due to the reasons considered above .",
    "the actual error limits may be revealed only through the numerical experiments with synthetic spectra .",
    "the model calculations with noisy data ( snr = 100 ) and spectral resolutions ( fwhm ) ranging from 3  km  s@xmath159 to 12  km  s@xmath159 have shown , however , that similar unsaturated profiles of c@xmath1 , si@xmath1 and fe@xmath1 ions provide the accuracy of the kinetic temperature estimation as high as 10% .      in the previous section we have considered the erm algorithm . the remaining problem now is to show the accuracy of the erm solutions and hence their reality .    since our computational procedure contains several _ ad hoc _ assumptions which can hardly be backed with unambiguous mathematical justification , it is natural to prove its validity through the recovering the kinetic temperature from the synthetic absorption - line spectra at first . for this purpose we have generated a variety of line profiles employing different sets of physical parameters and several random realizations of the one - dimensional velocity fields .",

    "the model parameters are listed in table  1 .    to calculate synthetic spectra we need to generate stochastic velocity fields at first .",
    "modeling of the stationary random velocity fields @xmath160 with different correlation ranges in space is performed through the moving average method described in appendix a. to generate the correlated fields , the following parameterized family of correlation functions was chosen ( see elliott _ et al . _",

    "the synthetic spectra were calculated for the fixed values of @xmath167 k and @xmath168  km  s@xmath159 , using different velocity fields .",
    "the velocity fields were chosen rather at random because our aim was mainly to show the ability of the method to recover the correct temperature from almost any velocity fields .",

    "this is the case when the ratio @xmath169 is large and the intensity fluctuations within the line profiles are considerably smoothed which in turn makes the widths of the subcomponents practically indistinguishable .",

    "the c  ii and si  ii lines were fitted simultaneously employing ( [ eq : e13 ] ) , ( [ eq : e20 ] ) and ( [ eq : e21 ] ) . the fit was performed with the increasing number of modes @xmath62 until a @xmath0-value of @xmath184 was achieved . in panels ( c ) and ( d )",

    "the optimal value of @xmath189 corresponding to the maximum curvature of the trajectory @xmath187 leads to the estimation @xmath190 k. given the kinetic temperature , we may calculate the radial - velocity distribution function @xmath38 using equation  ( [ eq : e19 ] ) and either c  ii or si  ii spectrum . for both sets of data",
    "the solution is expected to be identical .",
    "the results obtained are shown in panel ( f ) by solid curves .",
    "the histogram plotted in panel ( f ) is the underlying distribution function @xmath191 which corresponds to the velocity profile @xmath192 shown in panel  ( b ) .",

    "it seems quite natural to apply the standard voigt fitting procedure to our synthetic spectra to compare its result with the estimation obtained by the proposed method .    to carry out such analysis",

    "the parameter estimates are listed in table  3 along with the corresponding values of the gas temperatures @xmath197 and the turbulent velocities @xmath198 for the ` individual cloudlets ' .",

    "the corresponding equidispersion deconvolution ( with @xmath206 components ) is plotted in panels @xmath207 and @xmath208 in fig .",
    "these results lead to the conclusion that the spread of the gas temperature found in some regions of the ism and in the extragalactic intervening clouds may be unphysical and stems purely from an inappropriate method of data analysis .",
    "we turn now to a brief discussion of the application of the present computational technique to recover the kinetic temperature from observational data . for this purpose",
    "we have chosen the high quality keck spectra of the quasar q  19371009 ( tytler _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) showing metal absorption lines at the redshift @xmath4 .",
    "since this system is the only one where the deuterium absorption was observed at high redshift in both the d  ly@xmath103 and ly@xmath209 lines , it has been thoroughly studied using different methods ( tytler & burles 1997 ; levshakov _ et al . _ 1998a ; burles & tytler 1998 ) .    according to tytler & burles ,",
    "all metal absorption lines seen at this redshift ( c  ii , c  iv , si  ii , si  iv ) ` appear to have the same profiles ' .",
    "this may lead to the suggestion that these metals are similarly distributed in the velocity space and hence a single gas temperature could be sufficient to describe their profiles . to estimate its value ,",
    "we have selected the c  ii@xmath2 and si  ii@xmath3 lines observed with fwhm  = 8  km  s@xmath159 and s / n  = 56 and 100 , respectively .",
    "the original normalized data are shown in fig .  6 by dots with the corresponding error bars .    the voigt fitting analysis previously performed by tytler _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) revealed two gas clouds separated by 15  km  s@xmath159 ( the _ blue _ and the _ red _ components ) .",
    "the physical parameters found for these components are the following   ( tytler & burles )  : @xmath210  k , @xmath211  km  s@xmath159 , @xmath212  k , @xmath213  km  s@xmath159 ( where @xmath214 ) .    this system has also been analyzed by different method based on the mesoturbulent concept ( levshakov _ et al . _",

    "the gas temperature , @xmath138 , and the ensemble turbulent velocity dispersion , @xmath215 , estimated within the framework of the one - cloud model were found to lie in the ranges from 10900 to 14300  k and from 18.5 to 22.3  km  s@xmath159 , respectively .    applying the present procedure to the c  ii and si  ii lines , we obtained the gas temperature @xmath216  k. table  4 and fig .",

    "the square root of the central second moment of this distribution @xmath219  km  s@xmath159 depicted in panel @xmath207 may be considered as a measure of the one - dimensional velocity scatter along the space coordinate .",
    "this quantity naturally falls below the ensemble velocity dispersion @xmath215 because the sample of the velocity components parallel to the line of sight is not complete in the statistical sense ( see levshakov & kegel 1997 , for details ) .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "6c is a histogram which represents the velocity distribution derived from the analysis of the hydrogen and deuterium lines by the rmc procedure .",
    "in general we would expect and metals to give similar temperatures",
    ". they would be identical if absorbing gas was fully homogeneous .",
    "analyzing our results on the @xmath4 system we may conclude that both rmc and erm methods give the consistent estimate of the kinetic temperature , @xmath220  k. as for the velocity distribution of neutral hydrogen and deuterium and the velocity distribution of ionized metals , they apparently differ ( see fig .",
    "this difference , however , stems from the observed asymmetry of the deuterium and the optically thin metal absorption lines ( tytler & burles )  : the former exhibits the blue - side asymmetry , whereas the latter show the red - side skewness .",
    "the interpretation of this result may be as follows .",
    "it is generally believed that most metal absorption - line systems observed in qso spectra arise in the far outer parts of intervening galaxies or in the intergalactic medium where the main source of ionization is photoionization due to the background uv - flux . if the temperature of about 14000  k is the mean value for the absorbing gas at @xmath4 which is in thermal equilibrium , then variations in the fractional ionization of different species along the line of sight are mainly governed by the density fluctuations @xmath221 within this region because the thermal and ionization state of the gas is described by the ionization parameter @xmath222 which is the ratio of the density of ionizing photons to the total gas density .",
    "ionization models of optically thin in the lyman continuum intergalactic gas at constant pressure , photoionized by qsos , show that the equilibrium temperature is weakly dependent on @xmath222 for metallicities below solar and @xmath223 , where @xmath224 ( donahue & shull 1991 )",
    ". the deviations between the apparent radial - velocity distribution functions may occur when the fractional ionization of different elements responds in different ways to the changes in @xmath222 .",
    "such deviations may be utilized to place constraints on the density fluctuations within the absorbing gas .",
    "this problem will be studied in detail elsewhere .",
    "the outcome of our study , aiming to provide a measurement of the gas kinetic temperature from _",
    "similar _ complex absorption - line spectra of ions with different atomic weights is the following .",
    "\\(1 ) a new method is developed for using interstellar and intergalactic absorption - line spectra to investigate the intervening gas temperature .",
    "it is based on the assumption that a pair of elements has the same temperature and bulk motion within the absorbing region resulting in the similar observed spectra .",
    "the method utilizes the fourier transform of the observed profiles with the subsequent entropy - regularized minimization of the @xmath0 function augmented by a penalty function to gain a stable solution of the inverse problem of spectral analysis [ the erm method ] .",
    "\\(2 ) the computational procedure has been tested on a variety of synthetic spectra being generated in stochastic velocity fields with different correlation scales .",
    "the procedure proved to be very effective and robust allowing to recover the temperature with high accuracy , @xmath225  % , in the range of spectral resolutions from 3  km  s@xmath159 to 12  km  s@xmath159 ( fwhm ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the application of the standard voigt fitting analysis to the synthetic spectra calculated in the framework of the homogeneous temperature model with @xmath226  k revealed a wide scatter of the gas temperature among the individual ` cloudlets ' ,  from 10  k to @xmath227  k. this result demonstrates that the scattering of @xmath13 reported in the literature may have non - physical nature and may be caused by an inappropriate methodology .",
    "\\(4 ) the asymmetric c  ii@xmath2 and si  ii@xmath3 lines observed with the keck  i telescope at the redshift @xmath4 towards quasar 19371009 by tytler _",
    "_ have been treated by the proposed method in order to evaluate the underlying gas temperature .",
    "the obtained estimation of @xmath228  k lies in the range consistent with the previously derived values of @xmath13 from the analysis of the h+d ly@xmath103 and ly@xmath209 and higher order lyman series profiles by the reverse monte - carlo method ( levshakov _ et al . _",
    "1998a ) .",
    "it should be emphasized once again that the proposed method can be applied to the similar spectra only . in reality",
    "different ( non - similar ) profiles are observed as well ( see , e.g. , huang _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 , or songaila 1998 ) .",
    "they may be caused by a variety of physical reasons ,  overlapping of cold and hot gas clouds due to the doppler shifts of their radial velocities , variations in the ionizing flux produced by local sources and/or collisional ionizations in higher density sub - regions both leading to the diversity in the ionization fractions for different elements , etc .",
    ",  and hence there can not be a single physical model to treat such observational data .",

    "gaussian random fields arise in a wide variety of astrophysical problems including gas flows , large scale motions , turbulence etc . to study these problems one needs to model the stochastic fields with given characteristics ( power spectrum or covariance function ) .",
    "the moving average method employed in our modeling the intervening velocity fields is able to reproduce the true covariances over the larger scales as compared with the most common spectral ( fourier ) approximation ( pen 1997 ; elliott _",
    "the description below follows in general that presented in elliott _",
    "et al._.    consider the gaussian random field @xmath160 with the covariance function @xmath229 and the power spectrum @xmath230 . @xmath229 and @xmath230 are related through common equations representing the direct and inverse fourier transforms correspondingly  : @xmath231 and @xmath232        the moving average method stems from the discretization of  ( [ eq : a4 ] ) , resulting in the approximation @xmath237 where @xmath238 is a gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance @xmath239 , and @xmath240 being the step of the equally spaced grid points .",
    "gaussian fields are considered to be equal if they have the same mean and covariance function . therefore to test whether the approximation  ( [ eq : a6 ] ) represents the real field , we have to compare the covariance function of the approximated field with that which was adopted . in this way we may estimate the appropriate step size @xmath240 and the number of the grid points @xmath241 .",
