    "the description of hadron dynamics at large distances remains a crucial challenge of elementary particle physics for a long time . on the one hand ,",
    "the asymptotic freedom of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) allows one to apply perturbation theory to study some `` short  range '' phenomena , for instance , the lowest  lying bound states of heavy quark  antiquark systems . on the other hand , for the consistent description of many phenomena related to the `` long  range '' dynamics ( such as confinement of quarks , structure of the qcd vacuum , etc . ) something more than the usual perturbative approach has to be involved .",
    "theoretical analysis of the strong interaction basically relies upon the renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "usually , in order to describe the hadron dynamics in the asymptotical ultraviolet ( uv ) region , one applies the rg method together with perturbative calculations .",
    "however , this leads to unphysical singularities of the outcoming solutions to rg equations , that contradicts the general principles of local quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "an effective way to overcome such difficulties consists in invoking the analyticity requirement . this prescription became the underlying idea of the so - called analytic approach to qft,@xcite which was lately extended to qcd by shirkov and solovtsov.@xcite    in the framework of the analytic approach to qcd a new model for the strong running coupling",
    "has recently been developed.@xcite its basic idea is to impose the analyticity requirement on the rg @xmath1 function perturbative expansion for restoring its correct analytic properties ( see sec .  2 for the details ) .",
    "the analytic invariant charge possesses a number of profitable properties , in particular , it contains no unphysical singularities ( see also refs .   for the description of its traits ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that this analytic running coupling incorporates the perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative features of the strong interaction , and enables one to describe a wide range of hadron processes .",
    "a crucial insight into the nonperturbative aspects of the strong interaction at large distances can be provided by lattice simulations .",
    "this may be , for instance , the static quark ",
    "antiquark ( @xmath2 ) potential calculated up to the significantly large distances@xcite ( @xmath3fm ) , or the investigation of the topological structure of the qcd vacuum.@xcite certainly , a decisive test of any model for the strong interaction is its comparison with the lattice results .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study the asymptotic behavior of the static quark ",
    "antiquark potential constructed by making use of the analytic invariant charge .",
    "it is also of a primary interest to collate the derived @xmath2 potential with the relevant lattice simulation data . for verification the consistency of the results it is worth to evaluate the corresponding parameter @xmath0 and to compare it with its previous estimations obtained in the framework of approach in hand .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the model for the qcd analytic invariant charge is briefly described and its basic features are outlined . in sec .",
    "3 the asymptotic behavior of the quark ",
    "antiquark potential , constructed by making use of this strong running coupling , is examined .",
    "a technique for treating the divergent integrals encountered is developed here .",
    "the explicit expression for the @xmath2 potential , which possesses the obtained asymptotics , and satisfies the concavity condition , is derived . in sec .",
    "4 these results are applied to study of the relevant lattice simulation data .",
    "the constructed quark  antiquark potential agrees fairly well with the lattice data in the nonperturbative physically  relevant region . at the same time",
    ", it coincides with the perturbative @xmath2 potential at small distances .",
    "the fitted parameter @xmath0 is found to be in a good agreement with all its previous estimations , implying the consistency of obtained results . in the conclusion ( sec .",
    "5 ) the achieved goals are formulated in a compact way .",
    "as it has been mentioned in the introduction , the perturbative approximation of the @xmath1  function in the rg equation for the strong running coupling @xmath4 @xmath5}{d\\,\\ln\\mu^2 } = \\beta\\left(g(\\mu^2)\\right)\\ ] ] leads to unphysical singularities of the outcoming solutions , that contradicts the general principles of local quantum filed theory . a plausible way to overcome such difficulties",
    "consists in imposing the analyticity requirement on the perturbative expansion of the rg @xmath1  function for restoring its correct analytic properties .",
    "this prescription is a distinctive feature of the recently developed model for the qcd analytic invariant charge.@xcite at the one - loop level the corresponding renormalization group equation can be solved explicitly : @xmath6 while at the higher loop levels only the integral representation for the analytic invariant charge has been obtained ( see refs .  ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : aic ] presents the analytic running coupling @xmath7 at different loop levels .    .",
    "[ fig : aic],width=245 ]    the developed model for the qcd analytic invariant charge possesses a number of appealing traits ( see refs .  ) .",
    "namely , it has no unphysical singularities at any loop level ; it contains no adjustable parameters ; it incorporates ultraviolet asymptotic freedom with infrared ( ir ) enhancement in a single expression ; it has universal behavior both in uv and ir regions at any loop level ; it possesses a good higher loop and scheme stability .",
    "this model also enables one to describe various strong interaction processes both of perturbative and intrinsically nonperturbative nature ( see papers   and references therein ) .",
    "it is of a primary importance to mention here that the analytic invariant charge  ( [ aic ] ) has recently been rediscovered when studying the conformal inversion symmetry related to the size distribution of instantons.@xcite in particular , eq .",
    "( [ aic ] ) was proved to reproduce explicitly this kind of symmetry . in turn , the latter is in a good agreement with the relevant lattice data by the ukqcd collaboration@xcite ( see refs .   and   for the details ) .",
    "let us proceed now to the construction of the static quark  antiquark potential . in the framework of the one - gluon exchange model it is related to the strong running coupling @xmath8 by the 3-dimensional fourier transformation",
    "@xmath9 strictly speaking , this definition of the potential is justified for small distances ( @xmath10fm ) only .",
    "for example , the lowest  lying bound states of heavy quarks can be described by employing the perturbative qcd.@xcite however , at large distances ( @xmath11fm ) , which play the crucial role in hadron spectroscopy , the perturbative approach blows up due to unphysical singularities ( such as the landau pole ) of the strong running coupling .",
    "nevertheless , the model ( [ vrgen ] ) , being complemented with a certain insight into the nonperturbative behavior of the qcd invariant charge , has proved to be successful for description both heavy ",
    "quark and light  quark systems ( see , e.g. , reviews   and references therein for the details ) .    in this paper , for the construction of the static potential of the quark ",
    "antiquark interaction , we shall use the analytic invariant charge ( [ aic ] ) .",
    "after integration over angular variables , eq .",
    "( [ vrgen ] ) in this case takes the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is a reference scale of the dimension of length , which will be specified below .",
    "this integral diverges at the lower limit , that is a common feature of the models of such kind ( see , e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "we shall treat this divergence by employing the analytical regularization ( see eq .",
    "( [ intcont ] ) ) .    the analysis of eq .",
    "( [ vrint ] ) , performed in ref .  ,",
    "elucidated only the leading asymptotic behavior of @xmath16 at large distances .",
    "however , it is still desirable to examine at a more precise level the asymptotics of the quark ",
    "antiquark potential  ( [ vrint ] ) in the both , ultraviolet and infrared regions .",
    "this objective can be achieved in the following way .",
    "first of all , let us introduce a dimensionless variable @xmath17 and rewrite eq .",
    "( [ vrint ] ) : @xmath18 then , formally expanding the denominator of the integrand , one can find the asymptotic behavior of @xmath16 at both small and large distances : @xmath19 .",

    "( [ vrintexp ] ) it is worth considering an auxiliary integral of the form : @xmath22",
    "differentiating this equation @xmath23 times with respect to variable @xmath24 we obtain @xmath25 where @xmath26.\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( [ intaux1 ] ) the parameter @xmath24 takes the values @xmath27 ) , one has to go to the point @xmath28 , which is outside of this range .",
    "nevertheless , it can be done by making use of the analytic continuation of the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ intaux1 ] ) .",
    "this continuation is unique and it is defined obviously by the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ intaux1 ] ) all over the complex @xmath24plane except for the points @xmath29 , with  @xmath30 being a natural number .",
    "fortunately , we are not dealing with these values of the parameter  @xmath24 , and we can put @xmath31 it should be noted here that this analytical continuation plays the role of regularization of the expansion coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ vrintexp ] ) .",
    "it is also convenient to introduce the notations @xmath32 a few first coefficients ( [ uwdef ] ) have a quite simple form , namely @xmath33,@xmath34 @xmath35,@xmath34 @xmath36 ; and @xmath37,@xmath34 @xmath38,@xmath34 @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the euler s constant ( see ref .  ) .",
    "it is worth noting here that the leading coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 have also been calculated in ref .  , but by making use of another technique .",
    "thus , the static quark ",

    "it is of a particular interest to mention here that a similar rising behavior of the @xmath2 potential has been proposed@xcite a long time ago proceeding from the phenomenological assumptions .",
    "equation ( [ vrasympt ] ) describes the behavior of the static quark ",
    "antiquark potential  ( [ vrint ] ) at small and large distances .",
    "however , its straightforward extrapolation to all distances encounters poles of different orders at the point  @xmath47 , which apparently is an artifact of the expansion  ( [ vrintexp ] ) . for the practical purposes it would be undoubtedly useful to derive an explicit expression for the @xmath2 potential applicable for @xmath48 .    in order to construct an explicit interpolating formula for the quark ",
    "antiquark potential  ( [ vrint ] )",
    "we shall employ here the following method .",
    "let us modify the expansion ( [ vrasympt ] ) in a `` minimal '' way , by adding terms which only subtract the singularities at the point @xmath47 and do not contribute to the derived asymptotics .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the static quark ",
    "antiquark potential @xmath49_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize reg}}}+ \\sum_{m=0}^{m_0 } \\omega_m \\left [ \\frac{r}{(\\ln r)^{m+1}}\\right]_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize reg}}}\\right\\ } , \\label{vrreg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , and at the leading orders @xmath51_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize reg}}}= 1/(r\\,\\ln r ) - 1/p$ ] , @xmath52_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize reg}}}= 1/(r\\,(\\ln r)^2 ) - 1/p^{2}$ ] , and @xmath53_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize reg}}}= r/\\ln r - 1/p$ ] , @xmath54_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize reg}}}= r/(\\ln r)^2 - 2/p - 1/p^{2}$ ] , @xmath55 ( see also ref .  ) .    ) in dimensionless units at different levels of approximation : @xmath56 ( dashed curve ) , @xmath57 ( solid curve ) , @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) , and @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the one - loop perturbative result is shown by dotted curve.,width=245 ]    the numerical analysis of eq .",
    "( [ vrreg ] ) revealed that for practical purposes it is enough to retain the first five expansion terms ( @xmath57 ) therein .",
    "it turns out that the potential  ( [ vrreg ] ) itself and the corresponding estimation of the value of parameter @xmath0 are not affected by higher ",
    "order contributions .",
    "in particular , the curves ( [ vrreg ] ) for @xmath62 and for @xmath60 are practically indistinguishable of the curve corresponding to @xmath57 over the whole region @xmath63 ( see figure  [ fig : vrappr ] ) . and the higher  order estimations of the parameter @xmath0 vary within @xmath64 of the value obtained at the @xmath57 ( see sec .  4 further ) .",
    "thus , we arrive at the following explicit expression for the static quark ",

    "the correct short - distance behavior of the @xmath2  potential , the dimensional parameter  @xmath15 in this equation has to be identified with @xmath66 by the relation @xmath67 ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the potential ( [ vr ] ) satisfies also the concavity condition @xmath68 which is a general property of the gauge theories ( see ref .   for the details ) .",
    "in this section we are going to apply the obtained results to the study of recent quenched lattice simulation data@xcite on the static quark ",

    "defined by eq .",

    "the values of the parameters are : @xmath70mev , @xmath71 , @xmath72gev .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the relevant one - loop perturbative result .",

    "( [ vr ] ) were @xmath15 and the additive self  energy constant @xmath73 .",
    "the result of the fit is presented in figure  [ fig : vr ] .",
    "this figure shows that in the nonperturbative physically  relevant range @xmath74 , in which the average quark separations @xmath75 for quarkonia sits,@xcite the @xmath2 potential ( [ vr ] ) reproduces the lattice data@xcite fairly well . at the same time , in the region @xmath76 the derived potential coincides with the perturbative result ( dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : vr ] ) .",
    "the difference between the lattice data and the expression ( [ vr ] ) in the intermediate range @xmath77 may be explained by the presence of additional nonperturbative contributions at these distances ( see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "but the detailed investigation of this matter is beyond the scope of the paper .",
    "thus , the estimation of the parameter @xmath0 in the course of this comparison gives @xmath78mev ( this value corresponds to the one - loop level with @xmath79 active quarks ) .",
