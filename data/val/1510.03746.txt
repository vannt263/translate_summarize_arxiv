    "although there is another theory that describes the melting in two dimensional systems via the spontaneous generation of grain boundaries  @xcite , in this case , all the results strongly suggest the existence of an intermediate hexatic phase at high densities and temperatures on the phase diagram ( light purple area in fig .  [",
    "fig : pd ] ) , and that the phase transition follows the kthny theory , as observed for a single layer ( continuous phase transition ) and double layer ( weakly first - order phase transition ) of lennard - jones particles  @xcite .",
    "the question of whether the observed phase transition is strictly continuous or very weakly first order can not be answered with certainty from current results and is left for future studies .",
    "concerning the origin of the difference between the two melting processes ( one continuous , one discontinuous ) , it could be inferred from the previous discussion that it is stemming from the h - disorder kept in the hexatic and triangular phases , as opposed to the square - shape tubes ( and honeycomb ) phase .",
    "indeed , the thermal delocalization in the hexatic and triangular phases implies both , an effective monoatomic system , giving rise to a 2d close - packing in each layer , and an effective screening of the electrostatic interactions among water molecules .      after analyzing the different phase transitions , we focus on the characterization of the liquid . some of the properties of the liquid agree well with previously reported works  @xcite : the oxygens are organized into two main layers that are bridged by a constant flux of molecules .",
    "when the density of the liquid is increased , these two main layers become more pronounced and the flux of molecules is reduced .",

    "we choose a path within the phase diagram that connects the two phases ( see arrow 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd ] ) and we analyze the rdfs at each calculated point along this path .",
    "figure  [ fig : rdf ] shows the rdfs obtained from md and aimd calculations . although the water obtained from aimd tends to be more structured than the one obtained by md , the two are in reasonable agreement for the purposes of this study .",
    "one clear difference between the rdf of the honeycomb and triangular phases is the position of the second neighbor peak : for the honeycomb phase it is at @xmath29 , where _ a _ is the first neighbor distance , while for the triangular phase it is at @xmath30 .",
    "it is important to note that the peak at @xmath31 is also present for the triangular phase ; however , the large oxygen lattice vibrations caused by the hydrogen disorder broaden it out sufficiently for it to be no longer distinguishable .",
    "although we observe a continuous shifting of the second neighbor peak from @xmath32 towards @xmath33 as we get closer to the honeycomb ice rdf in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] , it is very significant how all the rdfs coming from the liquid samples show the characteristic peak of the triangular phase at @xmath32 , suggesting that the liquid maintains the local structure of triangular phase .",

    "as all the rdfs in fig .",
    "[ fig : rdf ] show a pronounced peak at this position , we conclude that there is a strong correlation between the two layers , with a strong tendency for every o in one layer to have another one just across in the other layer .",

    "the vertical dashed line represents the estimated density in which the liquid - hexatic transition occurs.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]    our various indicators suggest that the high - density liquid maintains many of the characteristics of triangular ice : high interlayer correlation and a local triangular structure of the oxygens , as shown in the rdfs , and a distinct separation between the two layers , as shown in the density profiles ( see appendix  [ a4 ] ) . in order to verify the latter , we estimate the average time ( @xmath37 ) that a molecule stays within a layer before jumping to the other layer .",
    "to do so , we divide the cell along the confining direction into two equal parts , and we extract the number of jumps that have occurred during the run from one side of the cell to the other .",
    "second , we estimate from the calculated diffusivity @xmath38 , the time needed by a molecule to jump a distance _ a _ within one layer ( which coincides with the interlayer distance ) using a random walk model : @xmath39(4@xmath38)@xmath26 .",
    "figure  [ fig : life ] shows these two values at @xmath15 @xmath28 g  @xmath10 and different temperatures ( following arrow 4 in fig .  [ fig : pd ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath37 obtained from empirical md and aimd calculations at t @xmath40 k are almost identical , supporting the reliability of our calculations . in all cases , @xmath37 is around 50 times larger than @xmath27 , which shows that the velocity scale of the diffusion in _ xy _ is much larger than in _",
    "z_. these results , together with the high interlayer correlation shown by the rdf , confirm that a molecule remains for an average of 10 ns in one layer before jumping to the other layer , and that its in - layer motion is closely mirrored by a partner molecule in the other layer ; in other words , the aa stacking is maintained by the liquid .",
    "furthermore , the decoupling in the dynamics between o and h that occurs in the hexatic and triangular phases is also clearly observed in the high - density liquid .",
    "figure  [ fig : factor ] shows the ratio ( @xmath41 ) with respect to density at @xmath42 300 k. this ratio is given by @xmath41 @xmath43 c@xmath44  c@xmath45 , where the characteristic time @xmath46 of each correlation function is obtained from c(@xmath46 ) @xmath43 0.5 . the larger the value of @xmath41 , the larger the decoupling between the dynamics of o and h. we estimate the density at which the liquid - hexatic phase transition occurs by looking at the 2d o - o correlation function ( insets in fig .  [ fig : factor ] ) , which are analogous to the rdfs but take into account both the @xmath47 and @xmath48 coordinates of the oxygens instead of the radial coordinate .",
    "the 2d o - o correlation function at @xmath15 @xmath35 g  @xmath10 shows a spherically symmetric first - neighbor ring , characteristic of the liquid , while at @xmath15 @xmath18 g  @xmath10 it transforms into a hexagon , characteristic of the hexatic phase .",
    "therefore , the phase transition at @xmath11 k is estimated to occur at @xmath15 @xmath49 g  @xmath10 . the important point to note",
    "is the behavior of alpha : it increases not only within the hexatic phase , but also from low- to high - density liquid .",
    "this means that the decoupling between the dynamics of o and h already occurs within the liquid .",
    "this points to a regime constituted by the triangular , hexatic , and liquid phases , in which the complexity of bilayer water seems to disappear , resulting in what resembles a simple monoatomic fluid .",
    "our simulations for bilayer water indicate the presence of two types of melting at high densities : a first order phase transition into an ice made of square tubes , at low temperature , and a continuous phase transition into triangular ice at higher @xmath50 . for the latter",
    "the observed phenomenology strongly suggests kthny two dimensional melting , including the observation of an intermediate hexatic phase between the solid and the liquid . during this continuous melting",
    "only the oxygens are affected , while the hydrogens keep behaving liquid - like , resulting in a unusual decoupling in the dynamics of each species .",
    "the characterization of the liquid shows that the triangular local structure is maintained , and the two layers are strongly correlated with very infrequent exchange of matter .",
    "we observe that the decoupling between the dynamics of o and h already starts in the liquid phase , showing the existence of a regime in the phase diagram constituted by the triangular , hexatic , and liquid phases , in which water resembles a simple monoatomic fluid .",
    "the unusual characteristics of the system in this regime allows us to expect that the dielectric properties of bilayer water differ markedly from the ones observed for its bulk counterpart . a preliminary estimation of the relative dielectric constant @xmath51 along the planar direction of the triangular ice shows that its value is slightly larger than 200 , substantially higher than the 53 obtained at room pressure and @xmath52 k for ih ice using the tip4p/2005 model  @xcite .",
    "due to the large constraints along the confining direction , the out - of - plane component of @xmath51 is expected to be very low : for the liquid at @xmath15 @xmath53 g  @xmath10 and @xmath11 k , we have obtained a value of @xmath51 = 3.1 .",

    "<S> moreover , we find an intermediate hexatic phase for the oxygens between the liquid and a triangular solid ice phase , following the kosterlitz - thouless - halperin - nelson - young theory for two - dimensional melting . the liquid itself tends to maintain the local structure of the triangular ice , with its two layers being strongly correlated , yet with very slow exchange of matter . </S>",
    "<S> the decoupling in the behavior of the oxygens and hydrogens gives rise to a regime in which the complexity of water seems to disappear , resulting in what resembles a simple monoatomic liquid . </S>",
    "<S> this intrinsic tendency of our simulated water may be useful for understanding novel behaviors in other confined and interfacial water systems . </S>"
