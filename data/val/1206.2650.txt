    "the center of the milky way galaxy has been the subject of intense study since the observation of infrared emission from the central star cluster @xcite and radio wavelength emission from the ionized gas in sgr  a west  @xcite and the central compact object sgr  a@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "being nearly 100 times closer than any other major galactic nucleus , our galactic center provides the best opportunity to observe the interaction of stars and gas with a super - massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "numerous authors have reviewed the contents and phenomena found in the galactic center .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite discuss observations of the interstellar gas that is most relevant for this paper .",
    "observations of stellar proper motions and radial velocities @xcite give a distance to the galactic center of 8.3kpc ( corresponding to an image scale of 25/pc ) and a black hole mass of 4.3 .",
    "stellar spectra and imaging give evidence for recent star formation or the capture of a recently formed star cluster @xcite .",
    "the stellar mass distribution in sgr  a west  is not well known .",
    "if there is an equilibrium stellar cusp , as expected for a cluster around a smbh @xcite , the radial dependence of the stellar density can be described by a broken power law with a slope @xmath1 for the cusp and @xmath2 outside the cusp @xcite .",
    "@xcite describes how the absence of a bahcall - wolf cusp is plausible assuming that the mass in the inner parsec is traced by old stars which would indicate a low - density core with radius @xmath30.5pc .",
    "some recent papers @xcite have suggested that there may be a relatively flat stellar density inside of @xmath41  pc .",
    "the most prominent interstellar matter in the central 1.5pc is the ionized gas and the associated warm dust @xcite .",
    "this gas has the appearance of a clumpy , filamentary multi - armed spiral @xcite .",
    "the mass of the ionized gas is several tens of .",
    "neutral atomic gas is also present in the inner few pc @xcite .",
    "although it is more difficult to observe , its mass is a factor @xmath410 times that of the ionized gas . beyond @xmath41.5  pc and extending out to @xmath410  pc ,",
    "the interstellar gas is mostly molecular , and is referred to as the circumnuclear disk or cnd @xcite .",
    "estimates for the mass of the cnd range from a few , based on millimeter dust emission @xcite , to , based on virial masses of molecular clumps @xcite .",
    "observations of infrared and radio hydrogen recombination lines ( rrls ) @xcite and infrared fine - structure lines @xcite provide information on the motion of the ionized gas through doppler shifts .",
    "the overall pattern is consistent with expectations for orbital motions in a potential dominated by the massive black hole : the highest velocities are found within a few arcseconds of sgr  a@xmath0 , and velocities tend to decrease going outward .",
    "much of the gas appears to be near a plane tipped @xmath5 from the galactic plane , with redshifts seen toward positive galactic longitudes and blueshifts generally seen toward negative longitudes .",
    "the motions of the molecular gas in the cnd are also mostly in the sense of galactic rotation , but with a roughly flat rotation curve , as distributed mass makes a larger contribution to the gravitational potential farther from the center .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the gas kinematics .",
    "@xcite originally saw the gas as being in a number of independently orbiting clouds , but better imaging , especially with the vla @xcite , showed that the ionized gas was better described as a collection of streamers , with the ` clouds ' being peaks in the emission along the streamers . @xcite and",
    "@xcite found that doppler shifts vary smoothly along the streamers .",
    "they modeled the ` western arc ' ( see fig .",
    "1 ) as the ionized inner rim of the cnd in a nearly circular orbit around the center , and the ` northern arm ' as a flow of gas approaching the center . @xcite obtained a complete data cube of the [ neii ]  emission from the inner 60@xmath690  and concluded that the gas kinematics of the western arc and northern arm were better modeled with circular motions , rather than motions along the streamers .",
    "they argued that the western arc and northern arm are orbiting in the same plane as the cnd and that they could be joined at their north ends to form a single spiral feature .",
    "the main problem with their interpretation was the lack of a physical explanation for the spiral .",
    "they suggested that it could be a density wave or a spiraling inflow affected by both gravitational and viscous forces , but in both cases it was hard to identify the forces responsible for organizing the gas into a spiral pattern .",
    "observations of infrared and radio hydrogen recombination line emission led various authors @xcite to return to the tidally stretched cloud model .",
    "@xcite strengthened this model by including proper motions of the ionized gas streamers .",
    "they fitted observations of the western arc , northern arm , and eastern arm with elliptical keplerian orbits in the potential of the central black hole .",
    "non - gravitational forces may also influence the gas distribution and motions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed polarized emission from the dust in the northern arm and bar region , indicating that mgauss magnetic fields are aligned along the ionized streamers . @xcite",
    "interpreted variations in the polarization to give a measure of the inclination of the magnetic fields from the plane of the sky . assuming that the flows are along the field lines",
    ", they obtained information about the 3-dimensional structure of the gas orbits .",
    "stellar winds apparently also affect the ionized gas .",
    "in several cases bow shocks are seen around stars , presumably as the stars move through the ionized medium or a wind from the central region blows past the stars @xcite .",
    "we have made new observations of the [ neii ]  emission from sgr  a westwith improved spectral and spatial resolution , as well as improved sensitivity . in this paper , we present these observations and compare them to the different models of the ionized gas kinematics .",
    "[ neii ]  line emission from sgr  a west  was observed in june 2003 with texes on the nasa irtf .",
    "texes , the texas echelon cross echelle spectrograph @xcite , is a high resolution spectrograph for wavelengths of 5 - 25@xmath7 m . at the 12.8@xmath7 m",
    "( 780.42@xmath8 ) wavelength of the [ neii ]  fine - structure line it has a spectral resolution of @xmath4.01@xmath8 , or 4 , and a spatial resolution along the entrance slit of @xmath41.3 .",
    "spectral and spatial sampling is 4 pixels per resolution element .",
    "this is a significant improvement over that of the data cube used by @xcite , which had a spectral resolution of 33and a spatial resolution of @xmath42 . for comparison ,",
    "the observations presented by @xcite have a spectral resolution of 14  ( with an hi thermal linewidth @xmath420 ) and a spatial resolution of @xmath41.25 .",
    "to map sgr  a west , the spectrograph slit was oriented n - s and stepped in 0.7  steps to the east , covering 76 . as the slit length is only 10 , multiple scans were made , separated by 5  in declination , to cover a region of @xmath9  centered near sgr  a@xmath0 . at 12.8@xmath7 m  the echelon spectral orders",
    "are about 10% longer than the detector width , leaving gaps between orders , with @xmath4230of each 255  order covered . to fill in these gaps , we made two sets of observations : one with the spectrum offset to center the red side of each echelon order on the detector array and one with the blue side centered .",
    "the spectral coverage of the combined data cube is -1300800 .",
    "the individual scans were reduced as described by @xcite , and the sky emission was subtracted from each using the median value along the scan as sky for each spectral pixel .",
    "we also subtracted fluctuating water vapor emission by subtracting a multiple of a spectrum obtained from the correlation of each spectral pixel with pixels containing strong water lines .",
    "the scans were merged to make two large maps with the spectral settings described above .",
    "the merging procedure involved cross - correlating contour maps of the scans to determine the appropriate offsets .",
    "the two maps were then combined , averaging overlapping spectral pixels , to complete the data cube .",
    "absolute coordinates were obtained by aligning ionized gas peaks with peaks in the vla continuum maps . due to uncertainties in the procedure to merge scans into a map , absolute and relative coordinates have uncertainties @xmath41 .",
    "the data cube was deconvolved using a maximum entropy method ( mem ) deconvolution routine , utilizing an algorithm from @xcite .",
    "this routine is designed to sharpen the image when the signal is high , while smoothing low signal regions .",
    "the routine effectively smoothed out the noise while slightly enhancing the resolution in regions where the line is apparent .",
    "the contour map of the data cube , summed over doppler shifts from @xmath10  to @xmath11  is shown in figure 1 , with the various filaments labeled .    a fits format deconvolved data cube , spectrally binned by two pixels and including -670  to + 345  is available in the on - line journal .",
    "using the new galactic center observations of [ neii ]  emission , we compare two models for the ionized gas motions in the region . the first models the filaments as tidally stretched clouds in which the gas is flowing along the streamers . for this model",
    ", we use the fitting parameters of @xcite where the gas filaments are taken to be on separate keplerian orbits .",
    "we refer to this as the  ellipse model . \"",
    "this model is the most widely accepted explanation for the ionized gas kinematics .",
    "the second model we discuss is similar to the model of @xcite .",
    "this model fits the gas on nearly circular orbits around sgr  a@xmath0  and connects the northern arm and the western arc into a single feature in one plane .",
    "we will refer to this model as the  circular orbit model , \" although we will allow the orbits to have a nonzero radial component .",
    "the circular orbit model has not received as much attention , but we are motivated to reevaluate it with the improved data and some discrepancies between the data and the ellipse model .",
    "the orbits fitted by @xcite are shown on the [ neii ]  image in figure 2 . to compare our data to this model , we first smoothed the [ neii ]  data cube spatially over a square box on the sky of width [ 17r@xmath12 pixels ] , where r@xmath12 is the radial distance from the center in parsecs .",
    "the data cube was then tagged with points along the ellipses separated by 1@xmath13 in the orbital planes , and spectra were extracted from the tagged points and used to construct the position - velocity diagrams shown in figure 3 .",
    "the model curves in figure 3 assume keplerian motions along the ellipses and a smbh mass of 4.2 .",
    "the elliptical orbit models fit rather well spatially , with emission seen typically for @xmath4180  along each orbit .",
    "the spectral fit , however , shows some discrepancies from the data . for the northern arm ( fig .",
    "3a ) the data are systematically offset in velocity from the model .",
    "this would be explained if the velocities in the northern arm are not aligned with the streamer as assumed , but are systematically tipped toward circular motions .",
    "this anomaly supports the previous assumption by @xcite that the gas is moving in circular orbits across the filaments .",
    "there is a similar anomaly in figure 3b , though less pronounced , as the proposed orbit for the western arc is almost circular .",
    "we note that figure 20 of @xcite shows a similar discrepancy between the elliptical orbit model and the rrl data . in general , the [ neii ]",
    "data agree with the rrl data , giving us confidence that the [ neii ]  line is a good tracer of the ionized gas .",
    "the kinematic model for the eastern arm ( figure 3c ) seems to be the least convincing .",
    "unfortunately , the circular orbit model also does not fit the eastern arm kinematics , so it is clear that more work is needed to accurately describe that filament .",
    "@xcite proposes a combined model for the eastern arm and the bar that deserves further study .",
    "the disagreement between the elliptical orbit models and the kinematic data indicates that the gas does not move along the ionized streamers , especially the northern arm .",
    "but before discarding this type of model , we should ask whether a tidally stretched cloud is necessarily stretched along its direction of motion . to answer this question we ran a simple two - dimensional hydrodynamic model , similar to that discussed in section 5.2 .",
    "in fact , whether the particles in an infalling cloud follow along a narrow streamer depends on the initial conditions of the simulation .",
    "in particular , if the cloud initially rotates in the prograde direction it forms an arc as it approaches the center , with the particle motions tipped from the arc toward more circular paths .",
    "although this suggests that a tidally stretched cloud model could be made which would agree better with the observations than those we considered , we were not able to find a very acceptable model of this type .",
    "consequently , we now proceed to consider other types of models .",
    "the discrepancies in the ellipse models provide motivation to reevaluate the circular orbit model of @xcite with the improved texes data . assuming circular velocities",
    ", we fit the [ neii ]  emission spectrally with parameters describing the plane in which the gas is moving ( that is , an inclination angle , @xmath14 , and the position angle of the line of nodes , @xmath15 ) , along with those describing the mass distribution in the region .",
    "the orbital speed was taken to be @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] , appropriate for orbital motions in a spherically symmetric mass distribution . if non - gravitational forces act on the gas or if the mass distribution is not spherically symmetric , @xmath17 can be taken to be a way of parameterizing the forces acting on the gas .",
    "the best fit was that plane which fit the most gas from the entire data cube on circular orbits , using a procedure described below .",
    "we also considered models in which we included a correction to the circular doppler velocity by adding an inward ( or outward ) radial component that allows the gas to be spiraling into ( or out of ) the galactic center .",
    "this radial component was made a free parameter , and could take the value zero .    for our calculations , we used two different stellar mass distributions .",
    "the first is a power law distribution adopted from @xcite noting that our observations are not particularly sensitive to the stellar mass and that these numbers contain large systematic uncertainties . ]",
    "@xmath18 here , we did not allow m@xmath19 and the power @xmath20 to be free parameters as the ionized gas is not especially sensitive to the stellar mass distribution , so they will take the values @xmath21 and 1.2 , respectively .",
    "the second mass distribution considered assumes a lorentzian density distribution @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the density at the center and @xmath24 is the core radius .",
    "this distribution flattens out within the core radius and drops as @xmath25 outside the core radius , roughly approximating an isothermal star cluster .",
    "equation 2 can be integrated to arrive at a mass distribution @xmath26    for each mass distribution model , we determined the best fit allowing the dynamical mass of sgr  a@xmath0  and the core stellar density , as well as the disk plane orientation , to be free parameters .",
    "because the black hole mass is well known from stellar observations @xcite and the [ neii ]  data are not especially sensitive to the stellar mass , it was useful to also find the best fits holding these parameters constant ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29pc ) .",
    "to determine the best parameters for the orbiting gas , we first searched through parameter space to find the best - fit orbital plane .",
    "for each set of parameters describing a plane and orbital motion , we calculated the doppler velocity at each spatial point in the data cube .",
    "we then shifted the spectrum at each point by that velocity so that all the emission fitting circular velocities in that plane would be aligned at the zero velocity wavelength , and collapsed the map into a single spectrum .",
    "we then compared how well the emission in the data cube fit the model velocities in a given plane with any other plane .",
    "to illustrate what this routine does we show in figure 4 the collapsed spectrum before the spectral shifting ( 4a ) and the spectrum corresponding to a good fit ( 4b ) .",
    "of course this method will always provide a  best fit \" set of parameters for any velocity model , and it is necessary to determine how good such a fit is .",
    "we have no quantitative way of stating error bars for the fit parameters because some velocity variations are expected due to turbulence , and the discrepancies from the fit are probably not due to random noise with any known distribution .",
    "in addition , we do not expect our model to fit all of the emission , as we know that not all of the gas lies in a single plane .",
    "after smoothing the shifted spectrum with a gaussian , we can determine the flux at zero doppler velocity , and compare the results with each set of parameters .",
    "alternatively , we can compare the flux in an interval around zero doppler velocity .",
    "the fitting procedure utilized the first method with a smoothing gaussian defined by @xmath30 $ ] , where @xmath31 is the separation from the spectral pixel to the zero velocity pixel and @xmath32 .",
    "we also give the results using the second method using a @xmath3330interval in table 1 . for a good fit",
    ", we would expect to gather a higher percentage of the total [ neii ]  emission in a lower percentage of the total velocity range .",
    "we provide these ratios as an easy way to interpret the results of the fitting , though this can be done essentially by looking at the gaussian fit to the collapsed spectrum that results from this routine .    in order to allow the gas to spiral into or out of the galactic center , we added to the calculated circular velocities a radial component which is equal to the fraction @xmath34 of the angular component , where @xmath35 is a free parameter .",
    "the gas can then be viewed as flowing along a linear spiral , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is measured in radians . the collapsed spectrum in figure 4b",
    "was made using the mass distribution in equation 3 and the parameters , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , m@xmath40 , @xmath41pc@xmath42 , r@xmath43pc , and @xmath44pc .",
    "the results of this fitting are compiled in table 1 .",
    "it includes the best fits for both stellar mass distributions , equation 1 and equation 3 , holding the black hole mass fixed and allowing it to change .",
    "we also determined the best fit using hcn(4 - 3 ) data from @xcite , to determine whether the orbital plane and mass distribution that fit the ionized gas also fit the molecular gas in the cnd .",
    "we also quote a  goodness parameter \" which is just the ratio of the emission that fits within @xmath3330  to the total emission in the map .",
    "again , this is not the same as quoting error bars , but it provides a rough measure of whether this fit could have been achieved by accident .    to accompany table 1 and the  goodness parameter , \" figure 5 shows the collapsed , shifted spectra corresponding to the different fits in the table .",
    "each set of conditions in table 1 provides an acceptable best fit , as seen in figure 5 .",
    "the ionized gas is not a good measure of the shape of the mass distribution and whether the mass should be in the black hole or in the stars . with the different mass distributions and mass constraints ,",
    "the best fits all give roughly the same orbital plane , with the exception of row 8 , which is described below .",
    "note that when using equation 3 for the stellar mass distribution , the best fit black hole mass is smaller than the accepted values from the literature .",
    "alternatively , if we constrain the mass to be 4.2 , we prefer no stars in the region .",
    "although there clearly are stars in sgr  a west , this result may be consistent with the suggestion that the stellar density is flat within @xmath41  pc , with a possible hole in the inner few arcseconds @xcite .",
    "we will speculate further on the low mass results in section 5 , but for now we will just examine the results shown in the fifth row of table 1 .",
    "in figure 6a we show the spatial distribution of the emission within @xmath3330  of the velocity of the best - fitting disk model .",
    "this emission gives a strong impression of a spiral pattern , as noted by @xcite , and ( partly to lead the eye ) we superimpose on the image a nearly linear ( archimedean ) spiral in the disk plane given by @xmath45pc@xmath46 .",
    "note that the disk plane used is that derived from the gas kinematics , not the spatial pattern , but it allows a good fit to the pattern . to define the spatial distribution for the spiral",
    ", we must specify another parameter which we take as the third euler angle , @xmath47 , ( the others being @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "the angle @xmath47 describes the starting point of the spiral .",
    "its effect is the same as adding a constant to @xmath48 and letting @xmath37 go negative .",
    "in figure 6a , @xmath49 .",
    "we note that our kinematic model involves gas moving along almost circular orbits , not along the spiral , implying that gas moves across the streamers . for the kinematic model presented here we use the parameters from the fifth row of table 1 .",
    "the disk parameters for the spiral structure are similar to those used by @xcite and by @xcite for the western arc , with an inclination angle @xmath38 and an angle of line of nodes @xmath39 .",
    "we display in figure 6b the integrated [ neii ]  emission with the emission shown in figure 6a masked out to see the gas that does not lie in the fitted plane . comparing to figure 1",
    ", we can see from figures 6a and 6b that most of the northern arm and western arc emission fits the velocity pattern described above , while the eastern arm and bar , as well as diffuse emission do not .",
    "note that the integrated intensity in figure 6a is 45% of that for the whole map ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this is the basis of the  goodness of fit \" for our method .",
    "it strengthens the argument that the fitting routine is not merely collecting random gas coincidentally if the percentage of the total emission that fits within a certain velocity range is greater than the percentage of the total velocity range in which it fits .",
    "so , in this case , the @xmath3330  range is less than 10% of the total velocity range for the map , while the emission collected in this range is about 45% of the total emission .    to determine how well the velocities of the gas match circular orbits as opposed to motions along the features we compare the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagrams for gas along the spiral shown in figure 6a , using the velocity patterns for purely circular orbits ( row 5 in table 1 , but with @xmath50pc ) and for motion along the spiral ( row 5 in table 1 , but with @xmath51pc ) .",
    "these two models are superposed on the p - v diagram in figure 7a .",
    "the best fit parameters include a small inward radial component to the velocity ( @xmath52pc ) , which is included in the p - v diagram in figure 7b . for the purely circular velocity pattern ( lower curve in figure 7a )",
    ", there is a slight offset in position angle along the northern arm , which validates the small nonzero inward radial velocity component in the best fit .",
    "the best fit parameters , including the radial velocity correction , make an excellent fit to the data ( figure 7b ) .",
    "we also tried to apply an inward radial velocity component with a constant pitch angle , so the radial component would be @xmath53 rather than @xmath54 . here , the parameter @xmath55 just shifts the p - v diagram up or down depending on the sign .",
    "the best fit in this case had a much smaller pitch angle , which had a negligible effect on the p - v diagram .",
    "this is because when the model is shifted up to agree with the data along the northern arm , the model along the western arc no longer fits .",
    "therefore , spiraling motion described by @xmath56 fits the data best .",
    "the top curve in figure 7a is for motion along the physical spiral in the best fit plane .",
    "we note that the model is offset from the data in the same way the ellipse model was offset .",
    "this is further confirmation that the gas is not flowing along the streamers .    although the best kinematic fit to gas near the northern arm / western arc plane involved little inward motion , we wanted to determine whether motion along a spiral in a different plane could fit the kinematic data while providing an acceptable fit to the spatial distribution .",
    "there was not a good fit that worked both spatially and spectrally .",
    "the best fit spectrally ( for motion along a spiral ) corresponded to a very poor fit spatially . by allowing the plane orientation parameter to vary substantially",
    ", we were able to fit the kinematics with a larger value of @xmath35 ( @xmath57pc ) , but the spiral described by this value of @xmath35 does not follow the observed spatial distribution .",
    "we show in figure 8 a contour map of hcn(4 - 3 ) emission from data by @xcite superposed on the grayscale image of the [ neii ]  emission .",
    "we used a procedure like that used with the [ neii ]  data to find the best - fitting plane and mass distribution to explain the hcn kinematics .",
    "much of the gas in the circumnuclear disk has been found to fit in a plane with inclination , @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "we can see from rows 3 and 7 of table 1 that our results are similar and that this plane is near the plane that fits the [ neii ]  kinematics .",
    "note that the cnd data are relatively insensitive to the inclination parameter as the rotation curve is mostly flat . when fitting the hcn(4 - 3 ) emission , we constrained the black hole mass , as the gas motions in the cnd are more sensitive to the stellar mass .",
    "the resulting stellar mass parameters are consistent with those derived in row 5 of table 1 .",
    "however , the inward radial velocity component , @xmath35 , is consistent with motions along the spiral that fits the ionized gas observations . at @xmath59pc , in the cnd , @xmath60pc corresponds to a pitch angle of @xmath61 and an inward velocity of 20 .",
    "the western arc has been described as the ionized inner rim of the cnd , so it is interesting to ask if the spiral pattern continues into the molecular gas .",
    "the hcn(4 - 3 ) emission that fits circular velocities in the plane of the spiral within @xmath3330   is shown in figure 9 .",
    "included on the hcn image is the spiral from the [ neii ]  map in figure 6a ( tagged every 1@xmath13 ) , and the same spiral offset in starting position by 75@xmath13 ( tagged every 3@xmath13 ) .",
    "much of the hcn(4 - 3 ) emission lies just outside the spiral used for the ionized gas , or along the second spiral .",
    "figure 10 shows the hcn p - v diagram extracted from along the outside spiral from figure 9 .    the model in figure 10",
    "does not fit as well as we had hoped , perhaps because the random motions in the cnd are a larger fraction of the orbital speed than those in the ionized spiral , though it does fit acceptably well , particularly in the region southwest of sgr  a@xmath0 .",
    "before discussing theoretical models and implications from our observations , we state the conclusions we have drawn that are independent of those models .",
    "approximately half of the ionic line emission from sgr  a west  comes from gas orbiting in a plane tipped about 25  from the galactic plane .",
    "this plane is coincident within uncertainties with that of the molecular circumnuclear disk .",
    "the gas in the disk plane moves on nearly circular orbits , with only a small inward velocity component .",
    "the doppler pattern is not consistent with motion along the northern arm ionized streamer .",
    "the observed speeds are close to , but probably somewhat less than expected for orbital motions in the gravitational potential of the central super - massive black hole and the distributed mass , as derived from the orbital motions of stars near the black hole and the distribution of stars .",
    "the spatial distribution of the ionized gas in the western arc and northern arm could be described by two ellipses in a plane close to that derived from the [ ne  ii ] line kinematics , but is somewhat better fitted with a single , approximately linear ( archimedean ) spiral .",
    "the fact that the doppler shifts of the ionized gas in the northern arm and western arc require nearly circular motions rather than motions along the streamers has been pointed out before @xcite .",
    "the elliptical model has become prevalent , perhaps mostly because the interpretation of these features as tidally stretched clouds is so natural , and because it is hard to understand how the ionized gas could be concentrated in an eccentric streamer like the northern arm if the gas motions are circular .",
    "we now add to this puzzle about the direction of motion of the gas the observation that the gas speed is probably less than expected in the potential of the black hole and star cluster . both of these observations need to be explained .",
    "we first ask about the possible significance of the fact that the best fit to the kinematic data involves orbital motions somewhat less than the expected keplerian velocities .",
    "one explanation for sub - keplerian velocities is that there are non - gravitational outward forces on the ionized gas , which might be caused by radiation pressure or by ram pressure of a hot wind .",
    "these forces might also contribute to the organization of the gas into the observed spiral pattern .",
    "the radiation pressure due to thomson scattering of photons from the central star cluster off of electrons can easily be shown to be negligible , as the electron scattering opacity is very small .",
    "the dust opacity is larger , so radiation pressure on dust mixed with the ionized gas should be considered .",
    "the importance of radiation pressure can be estimated by comparing the momentum flux from a stellar luminosity of a few  to the gravitational force on a parcel of gas with a column density corresponding to an optical depth to starlight of order one , assuming a normal interstellar dust to gas ratio .",
    "this calculation indicates that radiation pressure is a factor @xmath4100 less important than gravity , so probably not enough to account for the sub - keplerian velocities .",
    "if we assume that the x - ray emitting hot gas in the region generates a ram pressure equal to the thermal pressure of the gas , i.e. that the gas moves at the sound speed , we can estimate the ratio of the outward force from the hot gas to the gravitational force .",
    "using reasonable estimates for the size of a gas cloud and the hot gas temperature and electron density from @xcite , that ratio is about to . as an outward force",
    ", this will not cause the low velocities observed , but if it is seen as a drag force as the ionized gas flows past the hot gas , it might be enough to cause the slight spiraling inward motion observed in the ionized gas .    rather than explaining the possible sub - keplerian velocities with an outward force",
    ", we could explain them by hypothesizing that the gas slows its orbital motion due to a shock as it enters the spiral , and possibly the dissipation of kinetic energy is at least partially responsible for the ionization of the gas .",
    "a 20% decrease in the gas speed would be consistent with the observed doppler shifts and would correspond to a 40% loss in kinetic energy .",
    "however , even if all of the kinetic energy of the gas entering the northern arm were converted to ionization , the ionization rate would not balance the recombination rate derived from the free - free observation .",
    "so although a shock might contribute to the ionization of the gas , and it may affect the orbital speed of the gas , it is not likely to dominate the ionization .",
    "magnetic forces are likely to be greater than other non - gravitational forces",
    ". we can estimate their importance by comparing the magnetic energy density , or pressure , with the kinetic energy density of the orbiting gas and the gas pressure .",
    "@xcite give a lower limit on the field strength of 2 mg .",
    "this corresponds to an energy density of @xmath62erg .",
    "if we estimate the ionized gas density to be cm@xmath42 ( based on our unpublished observations of [ s  iii ] , which has a critical density of 1.7 ) , a mean particle mass of g , an orbital speed of 100 , and a temperature of 8000k , we calculate a kinetic energy density of 5erg   and a gas pressure of 8erg . apparently the magnetic pressure is substantially greater than the gas pressure , but probably substantially smaller than the kinetic energy density .",
    "consequently , we would expect the field to be carried along by the gas without altering the orbital speeds significantly , although it may exert forces which could perturb the gas motions , possibly influencing the density wave discussed below .",
    "we now turn to the origin of the spiral pattern and the observation that the gas moves across the northern arm and western arc streamers .",
    "there are two main problems with the idea that the gas motions do not align with the streamers .",
    "first , if the streamers move with the gas , they would wrap up quickly .",
    "the orbital period varies from a few @xmath64 years at the inner end of the northern arm , @xmath40.1 pc from the center , to @xmath65 yr at the inner edge of the cnd , so that a wrap should be added to the spiral pattern every few @xmath64 yr . on the other hand , if the gas moves across the streamers we need to explain why the emission is concentrated there .",
    "we also should explain how ionized gas could move across magnetic field lines , which the observations of @xcite clearly show to be aligned with the northern arm .    in the case of galactic spiral arms ,",
    "the wrapping problem is normally resolved by assuming that the gas and stars move through the arms , and are observed to be concentrated there because their orbits crowd and spend more time in the arms .",
    "perhaps the ionized gas spiral in the galactic center is also caused by a density wave . this possibility is supported by the fact that a one - armed spiral is the dominant instability in a disk with a nearly keplerian rotation curve @xcite .",
    "however , both the ionized and the atomic gas in sgr  a west  have densities which are much too small to support a gravitational instability , with toomre q parameters @xcite of @xmath41000 and @xmath450 , respectively .",
    "the molecular gas in the cnd could be gravitationally unstable if its mass is as large as concluded by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , if the smaller mass derived from far - infrared  dust emission @xcite is assumed , even the cnd should not support gravitational instabilities .",
    "the mass density of the stellar distribution is large enough to be gravitationally unstable if it is flattened into a disk , but the distribution of the older stars , which constitute the bulk of the stellar mass , is probably not highly flattened .",
    "we conclude that most likely the ionized spiral is not a result of a density wave caused by gravitational interactions within the disk . but",
    "a wave might be induced by another perturbing force , perhaps due to magnetic fields .",
    "alternatively , a perturbing force may not be necessary to organize the gas in sgr  a west  into a spiral pattern .",
    "the reason that a one - armed spiral is the main instability in a potential dominated by a point mass is that orbits are approximately elliptical , with one focus at the center , so that if gas orbits are eccentric with orientations varying with radius they crowd along a one - armed spiral .",
    "in addition , the presence of distributed mass in the star cluster modifies the potential in such a way as to cause the orbits to precess , which could cause their orientations to vary with radius .    to investigate the possibility that gas orbits in the galactic center gravitational potential naturally set up a spiral pattern we ran a simulation of orbits in a mass distribution like that in eq .",
    "1 . we started the simulation with orbits along aligned ellipses , with all ellipses having one focus at sgr  a@xmath0  and a distance between the two foci varying as @xmath66 , with @xmath67 , and with the orbital plane uniformly populated with particles representing the gas .",
    "each particle was allowed to orbit in the potential of a black hole plus a power - law stellar mass distribution , with no interactions between the particles . with this potential ,",
    "orbits are well approximated with ellipses that precess in the retrograde direction . that is , the time from apocenter to apocenter is less than the time for a 360@xmath13 motion . for a mass distribution power law steeper than r@xmath68 inner orbits",
    "precess faster than outer , causing the orbits to crowd along a leading spiral , whereas for a shallower power law outer orbits precess faster , causing a trailing spiral .",
    "the starting point of the simulation for an r@xmath69 stellar density distribution is shown in figure 11a , and the distribution of particles after 1.4yr is shown in figure 11b .",
    "the spiral persists for several times longer than it took to form since it wraps on a precession time scale , which is several @xmath70  yr , rather than the orbital time scale , which for the smallest orbits is several @xmath64  yr .",
    "the spiral in the simulation strongly resembles that which we observe , in that it is quite open ( not tightly wrapped ) and approximately linear or archimedean .",
    "in addition , the initial conditions of our simulation seem plausible as a situation that could result from the infall of a molecular cloud into the central region , and the relatively flat stellar density distribution required to produce a trailing spiral is consistent with recent observations @xcite .",
    "we also note that the differential precession that causes the orbit crowding only occurs within @xmath42  pc of the center , consistent with the lack of a prominent spiral pattern in the molecular gas in the cnd .",
    "our main concern about this model is that in the time required for an orbit at 1.5pc to precess by 360 , gas at 0.1pc will have orbited around the center roughly 100 times .",
    "whether gas could orbit this many times without being disrupted by stellar winds or other infalling clouds is unclear .",
    "we also compared the spiral wave model to the kinematic distribution observed with the [ neii ]  line by making a synthetic data cube with doppler shifts calculated for orbits along a set of ellipses with orientations varying linearly with radius and eccentricities varying with radius to a power .",
    "the resulting orbits agree well with those in our simulation .",
    "the orbital velocities were calculated assuming constant angular momentum and energy along each ellipse . for our calculations",
    ", we used the effective potential : @xmath71 which corresponds to a stellar mass distribution varying as @xmath72 . with this synthetic data cube",
    "we could calculate the predicted doppler shift at each point in the sky , allowing us to spectrally shift and collapse our observed data cube as we did for our circular orbit model , and to search for parameters that give the best agreement between the model and the data .",
    "the relevant parameters are the orientation for @xmath50 ( @xmath73 ) , the rate of change of orientation ( @xmath74 ) , and the rate of change in eccentricity ( given by @xmath75 , the eccentricity at @xmath76pc , and the power , @xmath77 , such that @xmath78 ) , as well as the potential energy parameters , @xmath79 , @xmath20 , and @xmath80 .",
    "we held the disk parameters constant at @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "the best fitting parameters were @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 .",
    "this corresponds to a stellar mass within r = 1pc of 1.16 .",
    "the spatial distribution of ellipses is shown plotted on the [ neii ]  data in figure 12a , and a p - v diagram extracted from along the northern arm and the western arc is shown in figure 12b .",
    "note that the density wave spiral model lies significantly outside the [ neii ]  spiral , which causes the model p - v diagram in the northern arm to turn to the red . by adjusting the starting position , @xmath73",
    ", we can bring the model closer spatially to the data . with @xmath90 , the density wave model lines up with the [ neii ]  emission , and , perhaps as expected , the p - v diagram looks like figure 7a for motion along the spiral . with @xmath91 ,",
    "the density wave peak lies just outside the [ neii ]  spiral ( figure 13 ) , and the model p - v pattern agrees well with the observations .",
    "we choose to manually adjust this parameter to specifically fit the observed spatial pattern .",
    "the original fit ( @xmath83 ) must have been affected by emission that is not part of the spiral pattern , resulting in a worse fit for the p - v diagram . by adjusting @xmath73 ,",
    "we see a far superior fit to the spiral , while presumably causing a worse fit for the material elsewhere in the map . that the ionized gas peak would lie inside of the density peak ( figure 13 ) is sensible if the gas becomes ionized on entering the spiral or if ionizing radiation illuminates the inner edge of the spiral .",
    "it is important to note that we now get a mass distribution similar to that determined by stellar observers .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the orbit crowding is strongest just beyond apocenter where the particles are moving more slowly than the circular speeds and are moving slightly inward , which is consistent with the slight inward velocity derived for the circular orbit model .    to test this model more",
    "thoroughly would require a hydrodynamic , or perhaps a magneto - hydrodynamic simulation , which will have to be a project for the future .",
    "one problem with a density wave model of the ionized spiral is explaining the high contrast seen , especially between the northern arm and the region just to its west , where the emission is a factor @xmath4100 fainter .",
    "a possible explanation is that the gas is not just compressed in the spiral , but is also more highly ionized there",
    ". the gas could be largely neutral over most of its orbit , but become ionized as a result of passing through a shock or by interacting with the magnetic field when entering the northern arm and western arc .",
    "although stellar ultraviolet radiation appears to be sufficient to account for the ionization of the gas in sgr  a west , the fact that the stars can only be observed in the infrared , making it difficult to determine their ultraviolet luminosities , leaves open the possibility of contribution by other sources of ionization .",
    "we can place an upper limit on the rate of conversion of kinetic energy into ionization in a shock by estimating the rate at which gas carries kinetic energy into the northern arm .",
    "if we estimate the mass of ( predominantly neutral ) gas in the inner 1.5 pc to be 1000 , take a typical speed of 100 , and assume 1/4 of its kinetic energy is dissipated once per orbit , or each time it passes through the spiral pattern , we estimate a power of 2 .",
    "this is much less than the ionizing luminosity of @xmath92needed to maintain the ionization @xcite .",
    "apparently shocks make at most a minor contribution to the ionization of the gas .",
    "we also have not explained the orientation of the magnetic field that runs along the northern arm .",
    "we ( perhaps naively ) would have expected the field lines to be aligned with the gas motions , which we conclude run diagonal to the northern arm . but compression of a field in a spiral shock may instead cause the field to be aligned parallel to the shock .",
    "a magneto - hydrodynamic simulation may be able to resolve this question .",
    "finally , we note that we have not proposed a model of the eastern arm and bar region , which account for about half of the ionic emission from sgr  a west .",
    "the elliptical orbit model of @xcite fits the spatial distribution of these features rather well , but does not agree well with the observed [ neii ]  kinematics .",
    "neither are these features fitted by circular motions of gas in a plane . as a speculative suggestion ,",
    "we note the morphological similarity of the eastern arm , especially its northeastern loop ( which is most prominent in the vla free - free maps ) to solar prominences .",
    "perhaps magnetic fields very close to the center are strong enough to lift ionized gas out of the center along this feature",
    ". a measurement of the magnetic field in this region would be difficult due to the faintness of the dust emission there , but would be of interest .",
    "the [ neii ]  observations strongly favor a model in which much of the ionized gas in sgr  a west  orbits in a plane close to that of the cnd , with nearly circular motions . the spatial pattern of the gas in this plane is well described by an approximately linear spiral , which includes the western arc and the northern arm .",
    "this model requires the gas orbits to cross the spiral , especially in the northern arm region .",
    "we have considered several implications of and physical models to explain these conclusions .",
    "the most promising physical model involves a spiral density wave resulting from the precession of elliptical orbits in the potential of the central super - massive black hole and star cluster .",
    "in addition to providing an explanation for the origin of the spiral , this model results in a best - fitting mass distribution in agreement with that derived from orbital motions of stars around the smbh , and with relatively flat stellar mass distribution in the inner parsec .",
