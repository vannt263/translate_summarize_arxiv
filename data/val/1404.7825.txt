    "a genuine connection between the laws of black holes mechanics and those of thermodynamics is widely believed today .",
    "it started out with a mere analogy connecting these two sets of laws which was first pointed out by bardeen , carter and hawking@xcite . only after the discovery of hawking radiation @xcite",
    ", it has been realized that these thermodynamic relations describe the thermal properties of a black hole . in this work",
    "hawking was able to show that a black hole behaves quantum mechanically as a black body radiator , with a temperature proportional to its surface gravity and entropy proportional to its horizon area @xcite .",
    "based on the above connection between entropy and horizon area , and that of temperature and surface gravity , jacobson @xcite found that einstein field equations can follow exactly from the fundamental thermodynamic relation between heat , entropy , and temperature @xmath5 , i.e. , clausius relation .",
    "the argument is based on demanding that clausius relation holds for all the local rindler causal horizons through each spacetime point .",
    "jacobson interpreted @xmath6 as the energy flux and @xmath7 as unruh temperature seen by an accelerated observer just inside the horizon .",
    "jacobson s work can be stated as follows ; from a thermodynamic point of view , einstein field equations are nothing but an equation of state for the spacetime under consideration . inspired by jacobson approach , cai et.al @xcite derived friedman equations of @xmath8-dimensional friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , from the clausius relation @xmath9 with the apparent horizon of frw universe , assuming that the entropy is proportional to the area of apparent horizon @xcite .",
    "the derivation of cai et al . was based on assuming that the apparent horizon has an entropy @xmath10 , and a temperature @xmath7 ;    s&= & , [ entropy ] + t&= &   [ hawking ] notice here that the entropy is proportional to the area , but the temperature is not proportional to the surface gravity @xmath11 , since = - ( 1- ) . as a result , the first law in this context is an approximation , where @xmath12 , has to be satisfied .",
    "this has been noticed and discussed by the authors in @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this approximation is that it constrains possible equations of state ( eos ) to be @xmath13 , i.e. , eos has to be close enough to that of the vacuum energy or de sitter spacetime .",
    "this can be shown clearly through the cosmological equation @xmath14 for a non - vanishing @xmath15 . to improve this thermodynamic description of frw cosmology , akbar and cai@xcite used the misner - sharp energy relation inside a sphere of radius @xmath16 of an apparent horizon and rewrite the dynamical friedman equation in the form of the first law of thermodynamics with a work term .",
    "de= t  ds+ w  dv , where the work density @xmath17 is given in terms of the energy density @xmath18 and the pressure of matter in the universe @xmath19 as follows :    w=(-p ) .",
    "in addition , they considered the misner - sharp energy to be the total energy of the matter existing inside the apparent horizon which is given by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the volume of the apparent horizon .    motivated again , by black hole physics , there is an another interesting connection between the hawking radiation and the uncertainty principle @xcite where the black hole can be modeled as @xmath22-dimensional sphere of size equal to twice of schwarzschild radius .",
    "since the hawking radiation is a quantum process , one could assume that the emitted particles should obey the heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "from this , one can derive exactly the hawking temperature and the thermodynamic properties of the black hole @xcite . from the black hole thermodynamics",
    ", it has been realized that ; as the black hole approaches zero mass , its temperature approaches infinity with infinite radiation rate which is considered a _",
    "catastrophic _ evaporation of the black hole .    a generalized uncertainty principle(gup ) was proposed by different approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory and black hole physics@xcite in which planck length plays an important role .",
    "the existence of planck length as a minimal observable length @xmath23 is a universal feature among all approaches of qg @xcite .",
    "this minimal length works as a natural cutoff , which is expected to have a crucial role in resolving curvature singularities in general relativity . by employing this gup",
    ", it was found that the black hole thermodynamics quantities , such as temperature , and entropy are completely modified such that the end - point of hawking radiation is not catastrophic anymore .",
    "this is because the gup implies the existence of black hole _",
    "remnants _ at which the specific heat vanishes and , therefore , the black hole can not exchange heat with the surrounding space @xcite .",
    "this means that gup prevents the black hole from evaporating completely , just like the standard uncertainty principle prevents the hydrogen atom from collapsing .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the gup modifies , significantly , the entropy - area law as has been pointed out by several authors ( see for example ref.s @xcite ) .    in this work we study exact modifications of the entropy - area law due to gup , which is used to modifying friedmann equations derived by akbar and cai in @xcite at very high densities .",
    "it is worth mentioning that gup has been studied with friedmann equations through different frameworks in @xcite . in this paper , we first derive the modified friedmann equations for a general form of the entropy as a function of area using the first law of thermodynamics @xmath24 .",
    "this generalization can host all possible correction to the entropy - area law like the logarithmic correction and power law corrections which are motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity such as string theory and loop quantum gravity@xcite .",
    "we then investigate an important entropy - area law which is motivated by the gup and study the modified friedmann equations derived through the first law approach introduced by akbar and cai in @xcite .",
    "studying the resulted friedmann equations reveals the existence of a maximum energy density closed to planck density . assuming a general continuous pressure @xmath0 leads to bounded curvature invariants and a general nonsingular evolution . as a result",
    ", the maximum energy density is reached in a finite time and there is no cosmological evolution beyond this point from a spacetime prospective .",
    "the existence of maximum energy density and a general nonsingular evolution is independent of the equation of state and the spacial curvature @xmath1 . as an example we study the evolution of the equation of state @xmath25 , using a phase - space diagram@xcite , to show the existence of a maximum energy density and a finite time to reach it .",
    "our results reveal that the big bang singularity is not accessible in this description since the spacetime itself can not be extended beyond planck density as a result of the gup and the thermodynamic approach to gravity which modifies friedmann equations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows , in sec .",

    "we conclude by showing the general implications of the modified friedmann equations that we found due to the exact entropy - area law obtained from the gup .",
    "in this section , we review the derivation of friedmann equations from the first law of thermodynamics relation with the apparent horizon of frw universe with assuming that the entropy is proportional to the area of the apparent horizon @xcite .",

    "the dynamical apparent horizon is determined by the relation @xmath31 , which would give the radius of the apparent horizon to be@xcite :    [ app - radius ] _ a = a  r= , where @xmath32 is the hubble parameter . by assuming that the matter which occupy the frw universe forms a perfect fluid , so the energy - momentum tensor would be : t_=(+p)u_u_+pg_. where @xmath33 is the four velocity of the fluid .",
