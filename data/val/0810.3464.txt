    "hadronic @xmath11 decays with kaons provide a good probe for the strange sector of a weak charged current .",
    "the decays of @xmath12 and @xmath13 are cabibbo suppressed decay . from the study of these modes",
    ", one can determine the strange quark mass and the ckm matrix of @xmath14 .",
    "on the other hand , the decay of @xmath15 , including @xmath16 occurs through a vector and axial - vector current .",
    "therefore , it is sensitive to the wess - zumino anomaly for su(3)@xmath17su(3)@xmath18 .",
    "this study was performed at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath2 collider  @xcite with the belle detector  @xcite .",
    "the kekb collider has realized the world - highest luminosity of @xmath19@xmath20s@xmath1 .",
    "the belle detector shows good particle identification ( pid ) ability .",
    "pid is based on the energy deposit and shower shape in the electromagnetic calorimeter , the momentum and @xmath21 measured in the drift chamber , the particle range in the muon chamber , the light yield in the aerogel threshold cherenkov counters , and the particle s time - of - flight from the tof counter  @xcite .",
    "the efficiency and fake rate for kaon identification is about 90% and 6% , respectively .    in following studies ,",
    "the detection efficiency for each signal mode and the amount of the background ( bg ) contribution are estimated from the data itself as well as monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . to generate signal events as well as",

    "the background from the @xmath22 process is simulated using evtgen  @xcite .",
    "the detector response is simulated by a geant3  @xcite based program .",
    "in the analysis , we select 3 - 1 topology events divided by the thrust axis , and require no energetic photon on the 3-prong signal side . the large amount of @xmath23 and two - photon bg processes are removed by requiring the missing energy to be due to the @xmath11 neutrinos in the signal candidates , and the lepton on the tag side .",
    "we apply the kaon identification to the charged particles on the signal side and categorize the final state .",
    "the main bg source after event selection is the @xmath11 decays with a mis - identified pion as a kaon .",
    "therefore , in order to suppress the systematic uncertainty , we analyze the cross - feed bg events simultaneously .",
    "figures  [ fig : m3h ] show the invariant mass distributions of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for samples with the corresponding pid selection , using data of 669fb@xmath1 .",
    "the contribution of @xmath23 and two - photon processes are found to be negligible from a mc estimation .",
    "the decays of @xmath12 and @xmath13 have large bg contributions due to a mis - identification of kaons . on the other hand ,",
    "the result of @xmath15 shows less bg because of a relatively high branching fraction .    ,",

    "cross points are data .",

    ", width=642 ]    considering the cross - feed contributions between @xmath27 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we evaluate the branching ratios ( br ) by solving the relation of the number of events using a matrix of efficiencies and fake rates , given in table  [ tbl : efficiencytable ] . the correlation matrix and the number of other bg events",
    "are evaluated by using mc samples .",
    ".summary of the efficiencies and fake rates . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with the normalization correction by leptonic @xmath11 decays and a systematic error evaluation , we obtain a preliminary result of br for @xmath12 as @xmath33 , together with @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty is an estimation of the track - finding efficiency , 3.2% .",
    "our result is consistent with the world average in pdg2006  @xcite .",
    "we study @xmath16 with data of 545fb@xmath1 by requiring the decay @xmath37 exclusively .",
    "the signal yield is evaluated using the invariant mass distribution of @xmath38 with an additional selection of the @xmath39 momentum , @xmath40gev/@xmath41 , and the @xmath42 system momentum , @xmath43gev/@xmath41 , in the center - of - mass ( cm ) system .",

    "the dashed , dot - dashed and dotted curves indicate the spectra of the interference term , the inverse of interference term and the non - resonant term , respectively . in figure ( b ) , the dotted and dash - dotted curves indicate @xmath46 contamination and the non-@xmath39 bg . ,",

    "we evaluate the contamination in the @xmath51 samples , from data samples by replacing the kaon selection by the pion , and taking into account the pid fake rate .",
    "another @xmath52% of bg is from @xmath53 , @xmath54 ( excluding @xmath39 ) , @xmath55 and non - resonant @xmath31 , and is estimated by mc .",
    "a possible peaking bg is @xmath56 ; however , this has not been measured yet . in order to measure the br , @xmath57",
    ", we apply the same criteria as that for the @xmath58 , but with additional requirements of @xmath50 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mkstar](b ) shows the @xmath38 mass distribution for @xmath45 .",
    "the large peaking bg is from @xmath16 with fake photons due to a hadronic shower in the calorimeter . by applying a fit with the breit - wigner ( bw ) function for the @xmath3 yield and the landau function for combinatorial bg",
    ", we obtain a signal yield of @xmath59 events after subtracting the peaking bg s of @xmath60 events .",
    "the signal efficiency is 0.54% . as a result",
    ", we obtain the first measurement of the br , @xmath61 .",
    "after the bg evaluation , we perform a fit to the @xmath38 mass distribution , with the following function : @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the invariant mass of @xmath38 , @xmath64 is the phase space and kinematical factor , @xmath65 is the bw function for @xmath3 , considering the spin , parity and damping factor discussed in the lass  @xcite and focus  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : mkstar](a ) and the br of @xmath78 with a non - resonant @xmath31 br of @xmath79 .",
    "the dominant systematic uncertainty is the errors of the track - finding and the pid efficiencies .",

    "the non - resonant @xmath81 contribution is @xmath82% , which agrees well with the focus result of @xmath83% .",
