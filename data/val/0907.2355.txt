    "adding a second component to a one - component liquid changes its static and dynamical properties .",
    "for instance , if one adds a low concentration of rather small species , depletion forces between the larger particles are induced @xcite .",
    "these effective forces are attractive for small separations and tend to stabilize the liquid phase in addition to influencing the transport properties @xcite .",
    "such mixing effects are interesting from a fundamental point of view , but also for applications .",
    "it is our main goal to study the influence of mixing on the glass transition of binary systems with hard core interactions in two and three dimensions .",
    "this will be done in the framework of mode coupling theory ( mct ) @xcite .    mixing effects on the mct glass transition",
    "were studied first by barrat and latz @xcite for binary soft spheres .",
    "however , the first _",
    "systematic _ investigation was performed by gtze and voigtmann @xcite for binary hard spheres with moderate size ratios @xmath0 . @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the radii of the small and big spheres , respectively . for size ratios close to unity , a slight extension of the glass regime was observed .",
    "larger size disparities induce a plasticization effect , leading to a stabilization of the liquid due to mixing .",
    "the results qualitatively agree with those from dynamic light scattering experiments @xcite and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to this , a recent theory of jurez - maldonado and medina - noyola based on the self consistent generalized langevin equation ( scgle ) @xcite predicts a plasticization effect also for size ratios close to unity .",
    "these authors argue that the data available from simulations and experiments are not sufficiently accurate to rule out one of the scenarios .",
    "size ratios far from unity , i.e. @xmath3 , may be problematic . first , the quality of e.g. percus - yevick ( py ) theory used to calculate the static input for mct may become less reliable .",
    "second , phase separation ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and third , a sequential arrest of the big and small particles ( by a type - a transition ) could occur .",
    "the diverging lengthscale associated with a type - a transition affects the quality of the mct approximations .",
    "the results of gtze and voigtmann @xcite exhibit four mixing effects , two of which were mentioned above . the two remaining mixing",
    "effects are an increase of the plateau values of the normalized correlation functions for intermediate times for almost all wave numbers upon increasing the concentration of the smaller particles , and a slowing down of the initial part of the relaxation of the big - big correlators towards these plateaus .",
    "our motivation is twofold .",
    "_ first _ , we want to explore whether these effects also exist in a corresponding _ two - dimensional _ liquid of binary hard discs . a recent experiment @xcite has given evidence for glassy behavior in a similar two - dimensional liquid including dipolar interactions .",
    "_ second _ , we will investigate in more detail the influence of mixing _ close _ to the monodisperse system , i.e. fixing the packing fraction @xmath4 at @xmath5 ( the critical packing fraction of the _ monodisperse _ system ) , how does a very small perturbation of the _ monodisperse _ system influence the glass transition ?",
    "the arbitrary small perturbation can be achieved in three ways , either by adding a very small concentration of smaller or bigger species for given arbitrary @xmath6 , or by a slight decrease of the diameter of an arbitrary concentration @xmath7 of the smaller particles , accompanied by a slight increase of the remaining particles , i.e. @xmath8 .    the mixing effects in the low concentration limits follow directly from the slopes @xmath9 at @xmath10 and @xmath11 of the glass transition lines ( gtls ) @xmath12 at fixed @xmath13 . if @xmath14 is positive ( negative ) , the liquid ( glass ) is stabilized .",

    "[ fig.6 ] and [ fig.7 ] ) .",
    "the second remaining mixing effect is the slowing down of the initial part of the relaxation towards the plateau values for the correlators of the big particles in the sense that @xmath216 versus @xmath225 becomes flatter upon increasing @xmath198 .",

    "more generally , eq .  ( [ slope1 ] ) holds for _ any _ system which has at least two control parameters and exhibits the generic @xmath123 bifurcation scenario @xcite .",

    "particularly , the same four mixing effects have been found as for hard spheres @xcite .",
    "however , we have also found some differences .",
    "the main difference is the fact that the extension of the glass regime due to mixing for size ratios close to unity is more strongly pronounced in 2d then in 3d .    for small size disparity",
    "we have presented analytical and numerical evidence that the stabilization of the glassy state is quadratic in @xmath228 and that the gtls are almost symmetric with respect to their equimolar concentration @xmath129 . at this concentration the stabilization is maximal .",
    "these properties have not been noticed before .",
    "finally , we have shown that the qualitative @xmath229-dependence of @xmath172 for some representative values of @xmath13 is identical to that of the random close packing @xmath189 .",
    "this is particularly true for the s - shape dependence for intermediate values for @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite is a nonequilibrium process which maximizes the density locally , it is not obvious that the stabilization effect is of entropic origin , at least for @xmath13 not too small .    at this point",
    "we should also remember that @xmath189 is not uniquely defined .",
    "for instance , a subsequent shaking of the configurations produced by the infinitesimal gravity protocol used in ref .",
    "@xcite would typically lead to random structures at even higher densities .",
    "hence , one may ask whether the qualitative trends shown in fig .  [ fig.4 ] are reproducible by using different procedures for calculating @xmath189 . a different approach is the investigation of jamming transitions of hard discs or hard spheres .",
