    "rich superclusters are the ideal environment for the detection of cluster mergings , because the peculiar velocities induced by the enhanced local density of the large scale structure favour the cluster - cluster and cluster - group collisions , in the same way as the caustics seen in the simulations .",
    "the most remarkable examples of cluster merging seen at an intermediate stage are found in the central region of the shapley concentration , the richest supercluster of clusters found within 300 h@xmath0 mpc ( zucca et al . 1993 ; hereafter h = h@xmath1/100 ) . on the basis of the two - dimensional distribution of galaxies of the cosmos / ukstj catalogue ,",
    "it is possible to find several complexes of interacting clusters , which suggest that the entire region is dynamically active .",
    "therefore , this supercluster represents a unique laboratory where it is possible to follow cluster mergings and to test related astrophysical consequences .",
    "it is believed that such dynamical events may modify the properties of the emission of cluster galaxies favouring the formation of radio halos , relicts and wide angle tail radio sources and the presence of post - starburst ( e+a ) galaxies .",
    "the a3558 cluster complex is a remarkable chain formed by the aco clusters a3558 , a3562 and a3556 , located at @xmath2 km / s and spanning @xmath3 h@xmath0 mpc perpendicular to the line of sight ( see fig .",
    "1 ) this structure is approximately at the geometrical centre of the shapley concentration and can be considered the core of this supercluster .    by the use of multifibre spectroscopy",
    ", we obtained 714 redshifts of galaxies in this region , confirming that the complex is a single connected structure , elongated perpendicularly to the line of sight .",
    "in particular , the number of measured redshifts of galaxies belonging to a3558 is @xmath4 , and thus this is one of the best sampled galaxy clusters in the literature .",
    "moreover , two smaller groups , dubbed sc 1327 - 312 and sc 1329 - 313 , were found both in the optical ( bardelli et al 1994 ) and x - ray band ( bardelli et al 1996 ) .    after a substructure analysis , bardelli et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that a large number of subgroups reside in this complex , meaning that this structure is dynamically active .",
    "it is possible to consider two main hypothesis for the origin of the a3558 cluster complex : one is that we are observing a cluster - cluster collision , just after the first core - core encounter , while the other considers repeated , incoherent group - group and group - cluster mergings focused at the geometrical centre of a large scale density excess ( the shapley concentration ) .",
    "the second hypothesis seems to be favoured by the presence of an excess of blue galaxies between a3558 and a3562 , i.e. in the position where the shock is expected .",
    "in order to test the effects of merging and group collision on the radio properties of clusters of galaxies , and on the radio properties of the galaxies within merging clusters , we started an extensive radio survey of the a3556-a3558-a3562 chain ( hereinafter the a3558 complex ) in the shapley concentration core .",
    "our survey is being carried out at 22/13 cm with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the main aims of our study can be summarised as follows :    _ ( a ) _ derive the bivariate radio - luminosity function for the early type galaxies in the complex , and compare it to that of galaxies in more relaxed environments and in the field ;    _ ( b ) _",
    "search for extended radio emission , in the form of _ relics _ or _ radio halos _ , associated with the clusters rather than with individual galaxies and presumably consequences of merging precesses ;    _ ( c ) _ study the physical properties of the extended radio galaxies in the complex , in order to derive information on their age , on the properties of the external medium , and on the projection effects in the groups or clusters where these sources are located .    the observational data available in the optical band and at x  ray energies ensure a global analysis of the environment and of the dynamical state of the structure .      our starting catalogue is the sample observed at 22 cm .",
    "the atca observations were carried out with a 128 mhz bandwidth , and in order to reduce bandwidth smearing effects , we took advantage of the spectral - line mode correlation , using 32 channels .",
    "the data were reduced using the miriad package ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ) , and the analysis of the images was carried out with the aips package .",
    "the resolution of our survey is @xmath5 , and the noise ranges from @xmath6jy to 0.2 mjy / beam .",
    "we considered reliable detections all sources with flux density @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 mjy .    in fig .",
    "2 the pointing centres are superimposed to the optical isodensity contours .",
    "the diameter of the circles in the figure corresponds @xmath9 arcmin , which is the size of the primary beam of the atca at 22 cm .",
    "a region of @xmath10 deg@xmath11 around the centre of a3556 was mosaiced in 1994 - 1995 with ten pointing centres ( venturi et al .",
    "1997 ) , numbered 1 to 10 in fig .",
    "three more pointings were placed south of a3558 , at the centre of the group sc 1329 and east of a3562 ( n1 , n2 and n3 respectively ) .",
    "furthemore , in order to completely cover the a3558 complex , archive atca data at the same resolution and band were reduced .",
    "these are the three fields centered on a3558 , sc1327 and a3562 ( hy31 , hy3 and hy22 respectively , from reid & hunstead ) . even if not part of the optical region , we included also archive observations of a3560 ( hy13 in fig .",
    "2 ) , located half degree south of the a3558 complex .",
    "the proximity of this cluster to the complex suggests that a3560 is probably infalling toward this structure and possibly at the early stages of interaction .",
    "we will not include the analysis of the a3560 image in the present paper , and the sources found in this field are not included in the discussion , however in this paper we will present the peculiar extended radio galaxy associated with the dominant giant multiple nuclei galaxy in the next section .    as it is clear from fig .",
    "2 we completely and nearly homogenously covered the a3558 complex with our radio survey , going from the western extreme of a3556 to the eastern extrem of a3562 .",
    "the total area covered is 2.9 deg@xmath11 , corresponding to @xmath12 sr .",
    "such good coverage allows us to study all the possible environments along the structutre : from the regions directly involved in the merging , where shocks , heating of gas and galaxy - galaxy interactions are expected to play an important role , to the more external ones , only mildly perturbed by tidal forces .",
    "we detected 323 radio sources with @xmath13 mjy . because of the primary beam attenuation , which increases the noise in the external part of the field , our survey is not complete down to this flux density limit .",
    "taking into account this effect , it is possible to consider our survey complete down to a flux density limit of 2.3 mjy .    among the 323 radio sources , 69 have an optical counterpart , which corresponds to 21% .",
    "27 out of the 69 identifications are in the redshift range of the shapley concentration , one is a foreground spiral galaxy ( v = 9066 km sec@xmath0 ) and two are background objects with a recession velocity v @xmath14 km sec@xmath0 .",
    "most of the 16 optical identifications brighter than m@xmath15 = 18.5 and without redshift information are very likely to be part of the supercluster , so the number of radio galaxies in the a3558 complex may increase once more redshifts are available in this region .",
    "the situation is summarised in fig .",
    "3 .    we can make very preliminary considerations .",
    "a first glance at fig .",
    "3 reveals that the radio sources are not uniformly distributed in the a3558 complex .",
    "comparison between fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 ensures us that gaps in the distribution of the radio sources do not correspond to uncovered regions in our survey . moreover , from fig .",
    "3 it is also clear that the radio galaxies in the complex are not clustered in the same way as the galaxy density peaks .",
    "we point out that the inner 20 arcmin in a3558 , the richest and most massive cluster in the chain , contain only two faint radio galaxies , while the much poorer cluster a3556 and the outermost region of a3562 contain a large number of radio galaxies .",
    "the peculiarity of a3556 at radio wavelengths was presented and discussed in venturi et al .",
    "1997 .",
    "four of the 27 radio galaxies belonging to the a3558 complex exhibit extended radio emission .",
    "in addition , very extended and peculiar emission is associated with the dominant galaxy in the a3560 cluster .",
    "their global properties are reported in table 1 .",
    ".properties of the extended galaxies in the a3558 complex [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,^,<,<,^ \" , ]     all these extended sources are associated with bright elliptical galaxies , and their radio power range is typical of low luminosity fri radio galaxies ( fanaroff & riley , 1974 ) , as it is commonly found in clusters of galaxies .",
    "this radio galaxy was presented and commented briefly on in venturi et al .",
    "we remind here that it is very unusual , in that it exhibits a _ wide - angle tail _",
    "morphology , all embedded in the optical galaxy , despite the large projected distance from the centre of a3556 ( 26 armcin , corresponding to 1 h@xmath0 mpc ) .",
    "wide - angle tail radio galaxies are always found at the centre of clusters : this large distance from the cluster centre raised the question of what bent the tails .",
    "reanalysis of rosat archive data and of the rosat all sky survey ( kull & boheringer 1998 ) shows that the gas distribution in the a3558 complex follows closely the distribution of the optical galaxies reported in fig . 2 and 3 , and has a low surface brightness extension which reaches the location of j1322@xmath163146 .",
    "a detailed study of this radio galaxy , including its dynamics and comparison with the properties of the intergalactic medium as derived from the x  ray data , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "a multiwavelength detailed study of this source was presented in venturi et al .",
    "here we summarise the most important conclusions , and present further considerations on the geometry of the a3556 core .",
    "j1324@xmath163138 ( see figs . in venturi et al .",
    "1998a ) is characterised by a steep spectrum both in the extended emission ( @xmath17 in the range 843 mhz - 4.9 ghz ) and in the `` nuclear '' component coincident with the optical counterpart .",
    "the source has low surface brightness and lacks polarised emission at any frequency .",
    "its internal pressure and magnetic field are lower than in typical radio galaxies in the same power range , and are intermediate between what is found along the tails of radio sources in galaxies in clusters , and in the few known relic source . by fitting the spectra of the extended and nuclear components with a model taking into account reisotropisation of electrons ( jaffe & perola 1973 )",
    ", we found that the age of last acceleration of the emitting electrons is @xmath18 yrs .",
    "we drew the conclusion that this radio galaxy is a _",
    "dead _ tailed source , in which the nuclear activity has switched off .",
    "the final evolution of the source is presently dominted by synchotron losses .",
    "we interpreted the lack of polarisation assuming that the source is seen through a dense screen of gas , and concluded that it is located beyond the core of a3556 and that a major merging event between the core of a3556 and the subgroup hosting this radio galaxy has already taken place .",
    "our suggestion is that merging triggered the radio emission in the associated optical galaxy .",
    "the old age derived for this source is consistent with the timescale of merging . by estimating the distance of the shock front of the merging from the centre of a3556 ( kang et al .",
    "1997 , ensslin et al .",
    "1998 ) , and comparing with the projected one , we found that the viewing angle is @xmath19 implying a maximum dimension for the source of @xmath20 1 h@xmath0 mpc .",
    "reduction of the archive 22 cm atca data centered on a3560 ( field hy13 in fig .",
    "3 ) , at the resolution of @xmath21 revealed the presence of a s@xmath22 = 943 mjy source , misplaced from the centre of the multiple nuclei cd galaxy located at the cluster centre and characterised by a very unusual morphology .    in order to understand the morphology of this source , and to study how it relates to the dominant cluster galaxy , we asked for a vla ad - hoc short observation at 20 cm and 6 cm , with the array in the hybrid configuration bna , suitable for the low declination of the source .",
    "the results of these observations are given in figs . 4a and 4b , where the vla images at 20 cm and 6 cm respectively are superimposed on the dss optical image .",
    "as it is clear from figs . 4a and 4b , the morphology of j1332@xmath163308 is complex , and it is suggestive of two distinct components .",
    "the 20 cm emission departs from the northernmost optical nucleus , in the shape of a wide - angle tail radio galaxy .",
    "the nucleus of the emission is visible in the 6 cm image , coincident with the norhernmost brightest optical nucleus and this reinforces the idea that this radio galaxy is a wide - angle tail source associated with an active nucleus , despite the lack of a visible jet in the high resolution map .",
    "the ridge of emission south of the secondary optical nucleus , well visible at 6 cm , and the southernmost amorphous extended emission are difficult to be interpreted .",
    "it seems unlikely that they are related to the wide - angle tail component . in the 6 cm map",
    "the ridge seems to point to the southernmost diffuse component .",
    "the overall structure of j1332@xmath163308 is reminescent of 3c338 , seen under a different viewing angle .",
    "3c338 is an extended classical double source associated with the multiple nuclei galaxy ngc6166 , located at the centre of the abell cluster a2199 .",
    "the steep spectrum ridge visible in 3c338 south of the location of the presently active nucleus was interpreted by burns et al .",
    "1993 as the remnant of a previous activity in the galaxy , associated with a different optical nucleus",
    ". the resolution and u - v coverage of our observations at 20 cm and 6 cm are too different to carry out a spectral index study , which is essential to derive the intrinsic properties of the various components , including their age , and to test our preliminary hypothesis that j1332@xmath163308 is a _ reborn _ radio galaxy , similarly to 3c338 .",
    "we are currently engaged in a detailed multifrequency study of this source , in order to disentangle its nature .",
    "22 cm maps of these two radio galaxies were presented in venturi et al .",
    "1998b . they both belong to a3562 , the easternmost cluster in the a3558 complex .",
    "the head - tail source j1333@xmath163141 is associated with a 17th magnitude elliptical galaxy located at @xmath23 from the centre of a3562 , and it is possibly orbiting around the cd galaxy in the potential well of the cluster .",
    "the total extent of the source is @xmath23 corresponding to @xmath20 40 kpc .",
    "the tail is straight up to @xmath24 from the nucleus , then the bending becomes relevant and the emission diffuse , suggesting that the two jets forming it ( not visible in our map because of resolution effects ) open at this distance from the core . in order to derive some global properties of this radio galaxy we studied in the wavelength range 13 - 22 cm .",
    "5 shows the 13 cm flux density contours of this source , superimposed on the dss optical image .    the total spectral index @xmath25 in this source at the resolution our the 22 cm image survey is 0.9 .",
    "this should probably be considered an upper limit since the 13 cm u - v plane is not well covered at the short spacings , and extended flux from the tail might have been missed in our image . with this preliminary value of the spectral index we derived the equipartition magnetic field and internal pressure in the source , computed assuming a filling factor @xmath26=1 , k=1 ( ratio between protons and electrons ) and integrating over a frequency range 10 mhz - 100 ghz .",
    "we obtained h@xmath27 g and p@xmath28 dyne @xmath29 .",
    "as stated above , these values should probably be considered lower limits , however , though preliminary , they are consistent with the average intrinsic physical quantities of the extended emission in cluster galaxies , and are significantly different from what is derived for j1324@xmath163138 , the extended radio galaxy at the other end of the a3558 complex .",
    "j1335@xmath163153 is a double source located at @xmath30 from the centre of a3562 , in the east direction .",
    "the radio morphology is asymmetric , with the western lobe longer and more distorted than the eastern one .",
    "it is possible that this source has a bent or distorted morphology and that we see it face - on .",
    "a more detailed study and comparison with the properties of the intergalactic medium as derived from the x  ray data is in progress .",
    "it is now well established that the gas distribution in the a3558 complex perfectly matches the distribution of the galaxy density , with galaxy density peaks coincident with gas density and temperature peaks .",
    "this result further reinforce the physical connection of gas and galaxies in the shapley concentration core ( bardelli et al .",
    "1994 , bardelli et al .",
    "1996 , ettori et al .",
    "1997 , kull & boehringer 1998 ) .",
    "since the 22 cm radio survey presented here covers the whole extent of the optical and x  ray data , we carried out a comparison between the x  ray distribution and the radio source distribution , in order to see if the radio galaxies also peak in galaxy and gas density peaks .",
    "we referred to kull & boehringer 1998 for our comparison , and binned the radio sources in our survey in the same 30 bins chosen by those authors to derive the gas density profile along the a3558 complex .",
    "we computed and plotted the ratio between the radio source counts and the x  ray luminosity ( in counts sec@xmath0 arcmin@xmath31 ) in each bin , both for the uncomplete ( but deeper ) 1 mjy sample and for the complete 2.3 mjy sample .",
    "we comment here that the sources in our survey obviously include the radio background .",
    "however , since it can be considered constant over the whole region of the a3558 complex it does not affect the shape of the radio source distribution .",
    "our preliminary result , shown in fig .",
    "6 , indicates that there is a deficiency of radio sources in the the x  ray peaks , i.e. in coincidence with the core of a3558 and a3562 .",
    "alternatively our plot can be interpreted as an excess of radio sources in those regions where ongoing merging is thought to be present .",
    "the most strinking result of our 22 cm survey is the non - uniform distribution of radio sources in the a3558 complex .",
    "the most massive and relaxed cluster in the chain , a3558 , exhibits very little radio emission , while the two extremes of the chain , where interactions and merging are supposed to dominate the dynamics , are populated by a large number of radio galaxies .",
    "a peak in the radio source distribution is also found in coincidence with the two groups sc1327 and sc1329 , known to be dynamically active .",
    "the apparent anticorrelation between the radio source counts and the x  ray emission in the chain also points towards the same considerations .",
    "our radio counts versus x  ray emission preliminary analysis on the a3558 complex suggests that the radio galaxies seem to avoid either very high gas density environments or evolved clusters . at this stage",
    "we can not discriminate between these two possibilities .",
    "comparison and analysis of literature data is essential to further study this effect .",
    "the study of the extended radio galaxies in this complex has revealed the presence of a complex source associated with the multiple nuclei dominant galaxy in a3560 , which could be the result of a restarted radio activity , possibly connected with merging processes ."
