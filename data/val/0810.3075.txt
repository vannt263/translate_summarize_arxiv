    "one of the most exciting aspects of modern physics is the investigation of emergent collective structures in many - body problems .",
    "spontaneous synchronization in networks of interacting nonlinear oscillators with different ( often randomly distributed ) frequencies is one of the best understood collective phenomena in nonequilibrium systems  @xcite . if the interaction between the oscillators is weak , then the oscillators will evolve in an uncoordinated fashion .",
    "in contrast , with proper connectivity and coupling strength , the population can display the same frequency as order forms .",
    "this collective behavior has been observed in diverse systems including neural networks  @xcite , josephson junctions  @xcite , lasers  @xcite , electronic circuits  @xcite , and a range of biological systems , including sleep cycles  @xcite , animal gaits @xcite and biological rhythms in general @xcite .",
    "useful insights into the phenomenon of synchronization are obtained by analyzing the idealized case of all - to - all coupling in the limit of a large number of oscillators . in one of the most common models",
    "each oscillator is described by a single variable , phase , that advances at a constant rate in the absence of coupling .",
    "this model is exactly soluble using a mean - field approach , and it provides a framework for understanding synchorinzation  @xcite . in this model , above a critical coupling strength the synchronized phase appears : a finite fraction of oscillators evolve at a common frequency .",
    "many features of this phase , such as the growth of the fraction of locked oscillators as a function of the coupling strength , can be calculated .    in many physical systems finite range interactions",
    "are a more realistic description .",
    "the simplest of these interactions are nearest neighbor couplings  @xcite . in general , finite range coupled systems are much harder to analyze , and , as a result , there are few theoretical tools that produce a quantitative description of the collective motion .",
    "much of our understanding of these systems rests on numerical solutions of the governing equations .",
    "we propose an alternative method to attack the synchronization problem .",
    "the method we develop is a real - space renormalization group ( rg ) designed to work well on systems with strong randomness , where both the intrinsic oscillation frequencies and coupling constants are random variables taken from distributions with long tails .",
    "the specific example we investigate contains lorentzian distributions .",
    "this method is shown to be accurate in systems with short range interactions .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze a one dimensional chain of oscillators interacting with their nearest neighbors . despite the relative simplicity of the model",
    ", it can exhibit complex behavior since randomness competes with a tendency to establish macroscopic order .",
    "this system is below the lower critical dimension for a synchronization transition ( strogatz and mirollo  @xcite showed that a nearest - neighbor chain can not exhibit extensive synchronization ) , and therefore can not be analyzed with mean - field techniques .",
    "collective behavior still arises , albeit at a finite length scale : the chain becomes fragmented into finite length clusters of coherently moving oscillators .",
    "we are interested in the distribution of cluster lengths , cluster frequencies , and how these change as a function of the coupling strengths and bare frequencies .",
    "additionally , we seek to develop a renormalization group scheme that will allow us to predict with some accuracy the _ individual _ local behavior of oscillators .",
    "we also carry out an extensive numerical study of the problem and use it as a benchmark for comparison with the rg .",

    "to analyze the random oscillator chain we develop a strong - disorder real space rg technique .",
    "a similar method has been used successfully in quantum mechanical systems to analyze the ground state of the random heisenberg model @xcite , and the superfluid - insulator transition in random bosonic chains  @xcite ( a quantum reactive analog of the nearest - neighbor chain , where the @xmath0 replaces @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is a quantum operator ) .",

    "the number of free spins is gradually decreased ; at the stage when all spins are bound into singlets , we obtain the ground state of the hamiltonian .",

    "we seek to understand the statistics of the cluster sizes and frequencies .",
    "the renormalization group approach is based on two observations .",
    "a strong coupling between two oscillators tends to force them to rotate at the same frequency forming a cluster that we can then treat as a single effective oscillator .",
    "concomitantly , oscillators with anomalously large frequencies rotate essentially independently , with little effect from their neighbors .",

    "the simulations are performed for a relatively long time of @xmath154 . running phases at each site",

    "the time @xmath157 is chosen to eliminate transients : increasing values are tried until average frequencies remain unchanged . in these simulations , the value of @xmath158 sets the resolution limit in @xmath159 to distinguish two neighboring frequency clusters .",
    "a group of oscillators is determined to be members of a synchronized cluster only if all the members ( @xmath160 ) have the same value of @xmath159 as the neighboring sites within some tolerance @xmath161 @xmath162 and @xmath163 . since @xmath164 is @xmath165 the tolerance @xmath166 is set to @xmath167 .",
    "while we are primarily interested in correctly capturing the statistical characteristics through rg , the local validity of our procedure can be established by comparing the frequency cluster structure that it predicts with results from the simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : real_space_comparison ] plots these comparisons over a representative sample of 150 oscillators from chains of @xmath150 at 3 different coupling distribution widths .",

    "as expected , the characteristic size of these clusters grows with @xmath136 .",
    "there is excellent agreement of the cluster sizes , locations , and frequencies between the two approaches .",
    "this provides some confidence that the essential mechanisms are captured by the rg procedure .",
    "analysis of these and similar plots , shows that the agreement of the cluster frequencies becomes more accurate with increasing cluster size .",
    "the reason for this result is the smaller boundary - to - bulk ratio of larger clusters , which is more apparent if eqs .",
    "( [ eq : model_general ] ) is rewritten as @xmath168 as clusters become larger , the importance of the coupling to the rest of the chain is weighted down by a @xmath169 factor . in the fast oscillator decimation",
    ", this is manifested by the appearance of this factor in the frequency correction .",
    "also , when a cluster is built up by a strong coupling decimation step , any frequency renormalizations of the component oscillators by prior fast oscillation decimation steps cancel when the weighted sum of the frequencies is calculated to give the frequency of the new cluster .",
    "thus the cluster frequencies @xmath170 are given to a good approximation by the average of the constituent bare @xmath108 values , plus the small correction due to the fast oscillator decimation step that yields the final cluster .",

    "the rms difference between the rg generated and numerically calculated curves ranges between @xmath172 , with the worst agreement in panel ( b ) , and best agreement in panel ( l ) .",
    "the region of the greatest discrepancy , small @xmath17 and @xmath108 , is in fact where the fast oscillator decimation is expected to be least accurate , since by the time the rg sweep reaches these frequencies , the distributions of remaining frequencies and couplings are no longer expected to be wide so that the approximations based on strong randomness are not as accurate .",
    "however the disagreement decreases with increasing @xmath17 , because , as described above , the frequencies of larger clusters are insensitive to the corrections from neighbors .",
    "let us now use the results of the rg and the simulations to discuss the statistical properties of the frequency clustering in the one dimensional oscillator chain with strong randomness .",

    "we proceed by making the assumption that the oscillators form just two synchronized clusters , and identify the break between the two clusters as where the condition @xmath193 is violated in the presumed cluster .",
    "thus if @xmath194 exceeds @xmath21 at some @xmath7 , we do not allow the cluster to form .",

    "[ fig : xi versus mu ] is the fit to the simulation results , suggesting the behavior @xmath196 while the fits to the rg data with and without the strain check give @xmath197 and @xmath198 .      given the simplicity of the renormalization group approach , one may wonder whether we can capture the behavior of the oscillator chain with a simple _ one - loop _ argument , based on the role of weak couplings in the limitation of cluster sizes .    indeed , the small clusters are likely to form between weak couplings , and since the distribution of separations between such weak couplings follows poisson statistics , an exponential distribution arises naturally . using this hypothesis the probability of finding a cluster of size @xmath7 ( i.e. , a cluster delimited by two weak couplings @xmath7 units apart ) is @xmath199 where @xmath200 and @xmath201 is a probability that any randomly chosen coupling is weak .",

    "[ fig : xi versus mu ] .",
    "the expression gives a good description of the data for @xmath209 , but overestimates the characteristic cluster size for larger values of @xmath136 .",
    "the renormalization group method , which does not treat all scales of frequencies and couplings at once , clearly provides better predictions then an estimation based on bare distributions .",
    "in this paper we investigated the collective behavior of a one - dimensional chain of coupled non - linear oscillators with random frequencies and nearest - neighbor couplings . for this purpose",
    "we developed a real space renormalization group approach , which is expected to be reliable in analyzing chains with large disorder .",
    "as we report above , our rg approach did an excellent job in capturing both the dynamics of individual oscillators , and the large scale behavior of the chain .",
    "the disordered oscillator chain has the potential of establishing macroscopic order , which is exhibited by a finite fraction of all oscillators in the system moving in accord with the same frequency . indeed in systems with higher connectivities ,",
    "such global synchronization may occur , but in the limit of short ranged interactions , the macroscopic order is stymied by fluctuations .",
    "this dynamical behavior is reminiscent of critical phenomena in equilibrium statistical mechanics , where for each system there exists a lower critical dimension , and only dimensionality higher than that allows macroscopic ordering . in our analysis , we concentrated on the quantities that most directly capture the collective aspects of the chain s behavior , and therefore also the competition between the interactions which seek to establish a synchronized phase , and the disorder - induced fluctuations which destroy it .",
    "this physics is fully contained in the cluster - size distribution , @xmath210 , which we find as a function of the interaction - strength tuning parameter , @xmath136 .",
    "the behavior of the average cluster size , @xmath178 , acts as an effective correlation length for the oscillator chain , where we once more think of our system in terms of the theory of critical phenomena .",
    "since our oscillator chain is below its lower critical dimension , it s phase diagram resembles that of the one - dimensional ising model , with @xmath136 serving the role of inverse temperature @xmath211 .",
    "the chain has an ordered phase , where all oscillators are synchronized , which is reached in the limit @xmath212 ( analogous to the ferromagnetic phase at @xmath213 ) .",
    "this phase , however , is described by an _",
    "unstable _ fixed point .",
    "if an rg flow can be extended to the entire parameter space , the full - synchronization fixed point flows under rg to the stable fixed point found at the non - interacting point , @xmath214 , which describes the unsynchronized phase ( analogous to the paramagnetic fixed point at @xmath215 ) .",
    "the putative flow diagram of the chain is shown in fig .",
    "the flow from the fully - synchronized point to the unsynchronized @xmath214 point is indeed associated with a length scale , whose meaning is the coarse - graining length at which the chain seems fully unsynchronized , _",
    "i.e. _ , consisting of single free oscillators .",
    "this length is the size of synchronized clusters in the original chain , @xmath178 .",
    "since @xmath178 serves as an effective correlation length , it may diverge in a universal fashion in the limit @xmath212 . while our rg method can only access moderate values of @xmath136",
    ", we cautiously argue that we can access the critical region , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster statistics mu ] . from our results",
    "we obtain the critical exponent @xmath216 of the synchronization transition : ( ) ~^ 0.48 [ nu ] note that this behavior is not analogous to the divergence of the ising chain correlation length @xmath217 .",
    "the method by which we obtained the above results constitutes the main achievement of this work .",
    "we developed a real space renormalization group scheme that successfully predicts the detailed behavior of a nonlinear oscillator chain with short - range interactions .",
    "we have implemented the rg scheme numerically on a chain of @xmath137 oscillators and compared its results with essentially exact simulations of the model equations , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : model ] ) ( see sec . [",
    "sec : results ] ) .",
    "the agreement is very good , and for some characteristics , such as the cluster frequency distributions at low frequencies , it improves with larger cluster sizes .",
    "this indicates particularly that our local rg scheme successfully captures the non - trivial collective features of the chain expressed in large synchronized clusters .",
    "one practical implication of our analysis may be found when considering coupled laser arrays , where only limited connectivity can be achieved .",
    "diode lasers , for example , are manufactured in one - dimensional bars that allow for evanescent coupling through overlapping electric fields . due to the exponential fall - off in the electric field envelope with distance",
    ", the coupling between well - behaved diodes can only be short ranged .",
    "the tools developed here could be used to study the extent of coherence that such systems exhibit .",
    "a potentially promising area of current research is constructing grids of diodes coupled in 2-dimensions by stacking 1-dimensional bars .",
    "our rg technique could possibly also be extended to such a system , and help clarify both its properties , and whether it can establish macroscopic coherence .",
    "our work suggests several other directions for future research .",
    "first , we may ask how can one improve the applicability of our rg scheme to larger values of the interaction parameter @xmath136 .",
    "this may be pursued by focusing on the concept of intra - cluster strain , which is roughly the variance of phase differences between neighboring oscillators within a cluster . as interaction increases ,",
    "cluster sizes grow , and bigger strain is needed to accommodate the spread of frequencies within a cluster ( cf .",
    "[ sec : xi_vs_mu ] ) . in our current scheme",
    "we made the first attempt to take this into account with the strain check based on the argument of  @xcite , a condition expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq : str_chk ] ) .",
    "this led to some improvement - for example , @xmath178 was modified in the right direction , but this modification was over - estimated .",
    "the strain check may be augmented in the future .",
    "a second natural question is the degree of universality in the oscillator chain .",
    "our result for the correlation length critical exponent @xmath216 , eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) , was obtained using lorentzian distributions .",
    "it is possible that the exponent depends on the nature of the tails of the distributions used ; lorentzians , for instance , do not have a variance .",
    "we intend to investigate the universality of @xmath216 alongside investigating the applicability of our rg scheme to distributions with narrower tails .",
    "a more general question concerns the development of an rg scheme and the analysis of synchronization in short - range networks at higher dimensions , and especially at two dimensions , which is very close to the lower critical dimension : refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that in two dimensions there may be a transition to a macroscopically synchronized phase , or that @xmath218 is the lower critical dimension giving rise to interesting anomalous behavior ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the development of a decimation procedure at dimensions higher than one is quite challenging because of the higher connectivity of the system , and the possibility that real - space local decimation steps change the geometry of the system .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank heywood tam for numerous discussions and tony lee for carefully checking the rg procedure .",
