    "people have studied reaction - diffusion systems , using analytical techniques , approximation methods , and simulation .",
    "the approximation methods may be different in different dimensions , as for example the mean field techniques , working good for high dimensions , generally do not give correct results for low dimensional systems .",
    "a large fraction of analytical studies , belong to low - dimensional ( specially one - dimensional ) systems , as solving low - dimensional systems should in principle be easier .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the term exactly - solvable have been used with different meanings . in @xcite",
    ", integrability means that the @xmath0-particle conditional probabilities s - matrix is factorized into a product of 2-particle s - matrices . in @xcite",
    ", solvability means closedness of the evolution equation of the empty intervals ( or their generalization .    in @xcite , a ten - parameter family of reaction - diffusion processes",
    "was introduced for which the evolution equation of @xmath1-point functions contains only @xmath1- or less- point functions .",
    "we call such systems autonomous . the average particle - number in each site has been obtained exactly for these models . in @xcite ,",
    "this has been generalized to multi - species systems and more - than - two - site interactions .    among the important aspects of reaction - diffusion systems ,",
    "is the phase structure of the system .",
    "the static phase structure concerns with the time - independent profiles of the system , while the dynamical phase structure concerns with the evolution of the system , specially its relaxation behavior . in @xcite , the phase structure of some classes of single- or multiple - species reaction - diffusion systems have been investigated .",
    "these investigations were bases on the one - point functions of the systems .    here",
    "we want to study the two - point functions of autonomous single - species one - dimensional reaction - diffusion systems . throughout this study",
    ", the initial condition of the system is taken to be translationally - invariant , so that it remains translational - invariant during the evolution . the two - point function for such systems",
    "is obtained , and it is shown that it exhibits a non - trivial dynamical phase structure . in section 2 ,",
    "the evolution equation of the two - point function is obtained . in section 3 , this equation is solved and the corresponding energy - spectrum is obtained . in section 4 , the parameter space of the system is analyzed . in section 5 ,",
    "the dynamical phase structure of the system ( the different phase regions in the parameter space ) is investigated .",
    "finally , section 6 is devoted to a one - parameter example family , which can be in all five phases .",
    "consider a one - dimensional periodic lattice , every point of which is empty or contains one particle .",
    "let the lattice have @xmath2 sites .",
    "the observables of such a system are the operators @xmath3 , where @xmath4 with @xmath5 denotes the site number , and @xmath6 denotes the hole or the particle : @xmath7 is the hole ( vacancy ) number operator at site @xmath4 , and @xmath8 is the particle number operator at site @xmath4 .",
    "one has obviously the constraint @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a covector the components of which ( @xmath11 s ) are all equal to one .",
    "the constraint , simply says that every site is either occupied by one particle or empty .",
    "a representation for these observables is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a diagonal @xmath14 matrix the only nonzero element of which is the @xmath15th diagonal element , and the operators 1 in the above expression are also @xmath14 matrices .",
    "it is seen that the constraint can be written as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a vector the components of which are @xmath13 s .",
    "the state of the system is characterized by a vector @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a @xmath20-dimensional vector space .",
    "all the elements of the vector @xmath21 are nonnegative , and @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the tensor - product of @xmath2 covectors @xmath10 .",
    "as the values of the number operators @xmath24 are zero or one ( and hence @xmath24 s are idempotent ) , the most general observable of such a system is the product of some of these number operators , or a sum of such terms .",
    "moreover , the constraint shows that the two components of @xmath25 are not independent .",
    "so , one can express any function of @xmath25 in terms of @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an arbitrary covector not parallel to @xmath10 .",
    "our aim is to study the evolution of the two - point functions constructed by @xmath28 s .",
    "the evolution of the state of the system is given by @xmath29 where the hamiltonian @xmath30 is stochastic , by which it is meant that its nondiagonal elements are nonnegative and @xmath31 the interaction is nearest - neighbor , if the hamiltonian is of the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 ( it has been assumed that the sites of the system are identical , that is , the system is translation - invariant .",
    "otherwise @xmath34 in the right - hand side of would depend on @xmath4 . )",
    "the two - site hamiltonian @xmath34 is stochastic , that is , its non - diagonal elements are nonnegative , and the sum of the elements of each of its columns vanishes : @xmath35 here @xmath34 is a @xmath36 matrix ( as the system under consideration has two possible states in each site and the interactions are nearest neighbor ) .",
    "the non - diagonal elements of @xmath34 are nonnegative and equal to the interaction rates ; that is , the element @xmath37 with @xmath38 is equal to the rate of change of the state @xmath39 to the state @xmath15 . @xmath15 and @xmath39 ,",
    "each represent the state of two adjacent sites .",
    "for example if @xmath40 and @xmath41 , then @xmath37 is the rate of particle diffusion to the right .    using @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are arbitrary covectors , one can write down the evolution equations of the one- and two - point functions of @xmath28 s . it turns out that in the evolution equation of the one - point function , there are two - point functions , and in the evolution - equation of the two - point function , there are three point functions , unless the reaction rates satisfy the following constraints  @xcite . @xmath45 where @xmath46 it can be seen that one can summarize the constraints in the compact form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and it is obvious that @xmath49    now , consider a system satisfying the constraints ( or equivalently ) , and take the vector @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 and the covector @xmath27 such that @xmath52 that is , the basis @xmath53 is dual to @xmath54 .",
    "this choice of @xmath55 makes the evolution equation of @xmath56 homogeneous . in @xcite",
    ", it is shown that the matrix in the left - hand side of the first equation in , has a left eigenvector with the eigenvalue zero .",
    "( this left eigenvector is @xmath10 . )",
    "so it does have a right eigenvector with the eigenvalue zero as well .",
    "that is , there does exist a vector @xmath50 satisfying .",
    "in fact , one can even find a real vector @xmath50 satisfying .",
    "from now on , @xmath27 in is assumed to satisfy .",
    "assume further , that the initial condition is translational - invariant .",
    "this means that the one - point function is independent of the site , and the two - point function depends on only the difference of the sites numbers .",
    "it turns out that the evolution equation for the one - point function is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 also , taking @xmath60 one arrives at @xmath61 where @xmath62 from the definition , it is also seen that @xmath63 it is seen that only five parameters enter the evolution equation of the up - to - two - point functions , and all of these can be expressed in terms of the matrix elements of @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the permutation matrix .",
    "these parameters can be rewritten as @xmath66",
    "the solution to ( the evolution equation of the one - point function ) is easily seen to be @xmath67.\\ ] ] putting this in , the second equation becomes @xmath68+\\sigma.\\ ] ] this , combined with the first equation of , and the constraint , are sufficient to obtain the two - point functions from their initial value .",
    "to do so , one takes a solution like @xmath69 and puts it in the equations .",
    "from the first equation of , one arrives at @xmath70 + 2\\nu\\ , f_{i\\ , e}(0),\\qquad 1<i < l.\\ ] ] becomes @xmath71 to solve , one takes @xmath72 putting this in , one arrives at @xmath73 the equation for @xmath74 is similar , and in fact @xmath74 is the inverse of @xmath75 .",
    "then , using , one can write as @xmath76 putting this in , one can obtain the coefficient @xmath77 .    for @xmath78 , or @xmath79 , the equation for @xmath77 is a nonhomogeneous one , and @xmath77 is obtained . for @xmath80 different to the above values ,",
    "the equation for @xmath77 is a homogeneous one , and only for certain values of @xmath80 there exist nonzero solutions for @xmath77 .",
    "these values of @xmath80 are among the eigenvalues of @xmath81 , of course .",
    "using , , and , the condition for @xmath77 being nonzero is seen to be @xmath82=(\\lambda-\\nu ) [ z^{-(l-1)/2}+z^{(l-1)/2}].\\ ] ] some of the roots of this equation ( for @xmath75 ) are phases ( their absolute value is one ) . in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath83 to infinity )",
    "it is easy to find the nonphase solutions .",
    "it is seen that if a solution has absolute value less than one , then in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath84 and it is obvious that such roots of are real .",
    "so , in the thermodynamic limit , the energy values @xmath80 entering the translationally - invariant two point function are zero , @xmath85 , the values coming from with @xmath86 , and possibly only one other value coming from with @xmath75 satisfying .",
    "the largest nonzero value of @xmath80 , determines the relaxation time towards the equilibrium .    one point should be noted . in general , the limit of the largest relaxation time of a finite system , as its size tends to infinity , may differ from the relaxation time of the infinite system .",
    "it can be shown , however , that it is not the case for our system .",
    "in fact , if one solves the eigenvalue equation for the infinite system , one has to omit the periodicity condition , and use instead a condition that the two - point function does not blow up in the limit that the distance between the two points tends to infinity .",
    "this means that either @xmath75 and @xmath74 ( the inverse of @xmath75 ) are unimodular , or in there remains only one term , the term corresponding to the one with modulus less than one . for the latter case , one again recovers .",
    "so , the spectrum of the infinite system , is in fact equal to the limit of the spectrum of the finite system with periodic boundary conditions , in the infinite - size limit .",
    "it is of course true that if in the initial condition , the coefficients of some eigenvectors vanish , then the relaxation time may differ from the largest relaxation time . but",
    "this happens independent of the size of the system .",
    "another case when the relaxation behavior of the infinite system differs from the limit that of the finite system , is when the spectrum becomes continuous to zero , that is , in the infinite limit system , there is no eigenvalue gap between zero and the other part of the spectrum . in this case , the relaxation behavior of the infinite system may be a power law , rather than exponential decaying .",
    "but again this is not the case for the present system .",
    "to summarize , in the present system the largest relaxation time of the infinite system is equal to the limit of of the largest relaxation time of the finite system .",
    "consider a one - dimensional single - species nearest - neighbor - interacting system , for which the evolution equations of up - to-@xmath1-point functions are autonomous .",
    "( we call such systems autonomous . )",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath34 characterizing such a system ( hence satisfying ) , contains 10 parameters . as it was seen from the previous section , of the parameters entering @xmath34",
    ", only five parameters enter in the evolution equation of the two - point functions .",
    "all of these are expressible in terms of the symmetrized ( with respect to permutation ) hamiltonian @xmath87 .",
    "it is easily seen that as @xmath34 satisfies , @xmath87 satisfies as well .",
    "so the system characterized by @xmath87 , is autonomous as well .",
    "such a system contains 6 independent rates .",
    "in fact , one can write @xmath87 as @xmath88 with @xmath89 of the five parameters entering the evolution equation of the two - point function , only three parameters determine the energy - spectrum .",
    "these are @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 : @xmath93 from these relations , it is seen that @xmath94 as the rates are nonnegative , if @xmath95 , then @xmath96 , which makes the two - point functions constant .",
    "assuming @xmath97 , one can scale time and make @xmath98 .",
    "so , apart from a time - scale , there are only two parameters determining the energy - spectrum , @xmath90 and @xmath92 : @xmath99 it can be shown that the whole region of the above is physical .",
    "that is , corresponding to any @xmath92 and @xmath90 satisfying the above inequalities , there are autonomous systems yielding the desired @xmath92 and @xmath90 . to prove this ,",
    "first consider four specific systems :    * @xmath100 .",
    "* @xmath101 .",
    "* @xmath102 .",
    "* @xmath103 .",
    "any point @xmath104 in the region described by , can be written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 s are nonnegative .",
    "a system with the rates @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the rate @xmath109 of the @xmath110th system introduced above , gives the desired @xmath104 .",
    "it was shown in the previous section , that for any nonzero hamiltonian @xmath97 , so that one can normalize @xmath91 to @xmath111 . in section 3",
    ", it was shown that the energies entering the two - point function are @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , where in the thermodynamic limit @xmath86 , or at most one non - unimodular @xmath75 exists , the value of which comes from .",
    "this is provided the absolute - value of the left - hand side of is less than one .",
    "so , the energies ( apart from @xmath112 ) are @xmath115 , any number in the interval @xmath116 $ ] , and possibly @xmath117 the largest relaxation time of the two - point function is @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the largest nonzero value of the energy spectrum .",
    "the relaxation time of the one - point function is @xmath120 .",
    "the fact that the energy spectrum of the one - point function consists of a single value , is a result of the translational - invariance of the initial state of the system .",
    "otherwise , there would be many energies for the one - point function , which could lead to a dynamical phase - transition in the one - point function @xcite .",
    "the comparison of the relaxation times of the two - point- and the one - point - functions , is a comparison of @xmath119 and @xmath115 .",
    "if the former is larger , the largest relaxation time of the two - point function is larger than the relaxation time of the one - point function ( the slow phases ) .",
    "if the two are equal , the relaxation - times are equal ( the fast phases ) .",
    "so , the relation of @xmath115 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 , determines the relaxation behavior of the two - point function ( its dynamical phase ) .",
    "it is seen that @xmath123 where @xmath124 has also been used . if @xmath125 , then the relaxation time of the one - point function is equal to the largest relaxation time of the two - point function . if @xmath126 , the the largest relaxation time of the two - point function is larger .    for @xmath121 to be among the energies ,",
    "the absolute value of the left - hand side of should be less than one .",
    "so , @xmath127    finally , @xmath128 from which ( using @xmath129 is nonnegative ) , @xmath130 @xmath131 is an ellipse , the interior points of which correspond to @xmath132 , and the exterior points of which correspond to @xmath133 .",
    "these three inequalities divide the whole phase space @xmath134 into five phases :    * @xmath135 + in this phase , @xmath126 , and @xmath121 is not an energy .",
    "this is the slower phase , and the largest energy is @xmath136 .",
    "* @xmath137 + in this phase , @xmath126 , and @xmath121 is an energy , in fact the largest one .",
    "this is the slowest phase , and the largest energy is @xmath138 .",
    "* @xmath139 + in this phase , @xmath140 , and @xmath121 is not an energy .",
    "this is the fastest phase , and the largest energy is @xmath141 .",
    "* @xmath142 + in this phase , @xmath140 , @xmath121 is an energy , and @xmath132 .",
    "this is the fast phase , and the largest energy is @xmath141 .",
    "* @xmath143 + in this phase , @xmath140 , @xmath121 is an energy , and @xmath133 .",
    "this is the slow phase , and the largest energy is @xmath138 .",
    "this phase structure is summarized in fig . 1 .",
    "as previously mentioned , these phases arise from the fact that the energy - spectrum of the two - point function consists of a continuous part , an energy equal to the energy appearing in the one - point function , and possibly another energy .",
    "this shows that the relaxation of the two - point function is at least as slow as that of the one - point function , and may be slower , depending on the relative position of the discrete and continuous parts of the spectrum .",
    "the fast phases ( phases * iii * and * iv * ) , are those in them the relaxation time of the one- and two - point functions are equal , while in the slow phases ( phases * i * , * ii * , and * v * ) , the relaxation of the two - point function is slower than that of the one - point function .",
    "consider a system with the hamiltonian @xmath144 this hamiltonian describes a system with the following reactions .",
    "@xmath145 it is seen that for this system , @xmath146 and @xmath147 for this system , @xmath148 defined through is equal to zero , hence there is no term proportional to @xmath149 in the right - hand side of .",
    "however , it is seen that adding a term @xmath150 to the hamiltonian @xmath34 in , changes the values of @xmath148 , @xmath91 , @xmath90 , and @xmath92 to @xmath151 for small values of @xmath152 , one can use @xmath153 , and @xmath90 and @xmath92 as in . then , with different values of @xmath154 , this system can exist in all the above five phases : @xmath155 it is seen that increasing @xmath154 , the system undergoes phase transitions from the phase * i * to * ii * , then * v * , * iv * , and finally * iii*.    99 g. m. schtz ; `` exactly solvable models for many - body systems far from equilibrium '' in `` phase transitions and critical phenomena , vol . * 19 * '' , c. domb & j. lebowitz ( eds . ) , ( academic press , london , 2000 ) . f. c. alcaraz , m. droz , m. henkel , & v. rittenberg ; ann . phys .",
