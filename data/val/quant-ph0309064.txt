    "feynman famously conjectured that unlike classical computers , quantum computers should be efficient at simulating quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "this was verified by lloyd @xcite , and further developed by several other authors , who demonstrated exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithms for a variety of quantum mechanical problems such as solution of the constant potential schrdinger and dirac equations using lattice gas automata @xcite , solution of the schrdinger equation in the circuit model @xcite , simulation of fermionic systems @xcite , computation of the thermal rate constant of chemical reactions @xcite , computation of correlation functions @xcite , simulation of topological field theories @xcite , and simulation of pairing hamiltonians such as the bcs model @xcite .",
    "a naturally related question is whether quantum computers can efficiently solve problems in _",
    "classical physics_. this question was first raised , and partially answered , in the context of ising spin glasses @xcite .",
    "it has recently received renewed attention in the context of hydrodynamics @xcite ( with polynomial speedups ) , chaos @xcite ( with exponential speedups , though some of these have been challenged @xcite ) , and knot theory @xcite ( so far without speedup ) , which has a deep connection to classical statistical mechanics @xcite .    here",
    "we revisit classical ising spin glasses and also address knot theory .",
    "the canonical problem of classical statistical thermodynamics is the calculation of the partition function @xmath1 . for a system in thermodynamic equilibrium ,",
    "if the partition function is known , one can obtain exact results for all thermodynamic quantities such as the magnetization , susceptibility and specific heat .",
    "models for which analytical calculations of this type can be performed include a variety of one dimensional ( 1d ) models and the 2d ising model @xcite",
    ". however , for most systems of interest , including the 3d ising model and most ising spin glass models , no analytical calculation of the partition function is available @xcite .",
    "we consider classical spin systems , in particular the ising model @xcite in which each spin has two states @xmath2 , and spins interact pairwise with an interaction energy of the form @xmath3 . from a computational complexity perspective",
    "this provides a rich class of problems .",
    "in particular , the problem of finding the ground state of the short range 3d ising spin glass ( quenched random @xmath4 ) , as well as the fully antiferromagnetic ( all @xmath5 ) 2d ising model in the presence of a constant magnetic field was shown by barahona to be np - hard , by a mapping to problems in graph theory .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that there exists a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme for the ferromagnetic ising model ( all @xmath6 ) , on arbitrary graphs @xcite .",
    "the problem of sampling from the gibbs distribution of the @xmath7 ( with random signs ) spin glass on a quantum computer was addressed in @xcite .",
    "a linear - time algorithm was found for the construction of the gibbs distribution of configurations in the ising model , including _ partially _ frustrated models .",
    "a magnetic field can be incorporated as well without increase in the run - time .",
    "the algorithm was designed so that each run provides one configuration with a quantum probability equal to the corresponding thermodynamic weight .",
    "i.e. , the probabilities of measuring states are ordered by the energies of the corresponding spin configurations , with the ground state having the highest probability .",
    "therefore the partition function is approximated efficiently and statistical averages needed for calculations of thermodynamic quantities obtained from the partition function , are approximated in the fastest converging order in the number of measurements . unlike monte carlo simulations on a classical computer , consecutive measurements on a quantum computer can be totally uncorrelated .",
    "thus the algorithm neither suffers from critical slowing down ( a polynomial slowdown in monte carlo moves associated with large correlated spin clusters forming near the critical temperature ) @xcite , nor gets stuck in local minima .",
    "this _ uniform _ performance is an advantage over the best known classical algorithms , which are tailored to specific lattices or graphs @xcite .",
    "however , the main problem of the algorithm is the limited control it offers in the construction of a _ specific _ realization of bonds on the ising lattice .",
    "indeed , since the run - time of the algorithm is linear , it is reasonable to suspect that it can not simulate a hard instance of an ising spin glass .    a completely different approach to sampling from the gibbs distribution for the _ ferromagnetic _ ising model was recently developed by nayak , schulman and vazirani ( nsv ) @xcite , which however does not appear to provide a speedup over the best known classical algorithm @xcite .",
    "the vns algorithm for the ferromagnetic ising model uses an interesting representation of the partition function as a discrete fourier transform , in conjunction with a markov chain sampling procedure .",
    "two of the main results of the present paper are ( i ) the generalization of this fourier transform representation to the @xmath0 spin glass case , ( ii ) ( the central result ) a connection of this representation to certain simple sums known as quadratically signed weight enumerators  ( qwgts ) . let us now motivate the importance of result ( ii ) .    in virtually all previous work on simulation of physical systems on quantum computers @xcite ,",
    "the approach pursued was one of attempting to find a _",
    "concrete algorithm _ for a specific simulation problem .",
    "a fruitful alternative is to consider instead the question of the _ complexity class _ that the simulation problem belongs to .",
    "we do this here by following a lead due to the knill and laflamme ( kl ) : kl showed that quantum computing is polynomially equivalent to classical probabilistic computing with an oracle for estimating qwgts @xcite .",
    "combined with our results ( i),(ii ) , this suggests that the quantum computational complexity of sampling from the gibbs distribution for the ising spin glass problem can be understood in terms of qwgts .",
    "however , we have unfortunately not yet been able to establish the connection at this level . nevertheless , the _ possibility _ of a ( spin glass)-(qwgts)-(quantum computation ) connection is sufficiently tantalizing to point it out in detail .",
    "we hope that by expressing the partition function as a qwgt we have taken the first step in a direction that will allow future research to explore the important question of the quantum computational complexity of the ising spin glass problem .",
    "in fact , the connections do not end here .",
    "there is a rich inter - relation between classical statistical mechanics and topology , in particular the theory of classification of knots .",
    "the first such connection was established by jones @xcite , who discovered knot invariants ( the jones polynomial ) during his investigation of topological properties of braids @xcite .",
    "it is known that classical evaluation of the jones polynomial is # p - hard @xcite .",
    "the connection between knots and models of classical statistical mechanics was greatly embellished by kauffman @xcite . here",
    "we will exploit this connection to show [ our main result ( iii ) ] that the evaluation of another knot invariant , the kauffman polynomial , can also be cast in some cases as a qwgt evaluation problem .",
    "thus a quantum algorithm for qwgt evaluation should shed light on the quantum computational complexity of knot invariants , a subject which has been explored by freedman et al .",
    "@xcite and by kauffman and lomonaco @xcite .",
    "knot invariants are , in turn , also tightly related to graph theory ; e.g. , the graph coloring problem can be considered an instance of evaluation of the kauffman polynomial , via the tutte polynomial @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the reason that these seemingly unrelated subjects are all inter - related is due to the fact that key properties can be expressed , in all cases , in terms of certain polynomials .",
    "while these polynomials originate from widely distinct problems , from the point of view of computational complexity their evaluation is one and the same problem , much in the same spirit as the fact that solving one problem in the class of np - complete problems solves them all @xcite .",
    "the present work contributes to this unification .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ fourier ] we derive our first main result : we rewrite the ising spin glass partition function for an arbitrary graph as a discrete fourier transform .",
    "this motivates the consideration of the partition function evaluation problem in terms of its computational complexity , which we formalize in sec .",
    "[ complexity ] .",
    "we then review qwgts in sec .",
    "[ qwgt ] . in section  [ connection ]",
    "we derive our second main result : the connection between the evaluation of the ising spin glass partition function and qwgts . in sec .",
    "[ knots ] we continue the program of connecting disparate objects to the problem of qwgt evaluation , and obtain our third main result : we show that the kauffman polynomial too can be expressed a qwgt .",
    "we do this after first reviewing the connection between knots and classical statistical mechanics . section  [ conclusion ] concludes .",
    "some further observations concerning the representation of the partition function are collected in appendix  [ further ] .",
    "let @xmath8 be a finite , arbitrary undirected graph with @xmath9 edges and @xmath10 vertices .",
    "identify each vertex @xmath11 with a classical spin ( @xmath12 ) and each edge @xmath13 with a bond ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "denote a given spin configuration by @xmath14 and a bond configuration by @xmath15 .",
    "we assume that the bond configuration is chosen at random and then remains fixed ( quenched randomness ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is    @xmath16    ( we remark on the case with a magnetic field in appendix [ appa ] . ) the probability of the spin configuration @xmath17 in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath18 is given by the gibbs distribution :    @xmath19    where the boltzmann weight is @xmath20 ,   \\label{eq : boltz}\\]]@xmath21 is the inverse temperature , and @xmath1 is the partition function : @xmath22 .",

    "let @xmath38 denote such a subgraph , with @xmath39 edges .",
    "there are @xmath40 ways of choosing subgraphs with @xmath41 edges .",
    "thus the total number of subgraphs is :        @xmath42    this suggests to label the subgraphs in a binary fashion ( to be explained below ) : let @xmath43 ( where @xmath44 ) be the binary number of subgraph @xmath45 .",
    "the numbering is such that @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) indicates the presence ( absence ) of edge number @xmath48 of @xmath49 .",
    "further , we will use the convention that first all @xmath9 single - edge subgraphs are counted ( i.e. , vectors @xmath45 with a single @xmath50 entry , all the rest @xmath47 ) , then all @xmath51 double - edge subgraphs ( vectors @xmath45 with two @xmath50 entries , all the rest @xmath47 ) , etc . thus ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath52 could corresponds to the subgraph containing only the first edge ( or bond ) : @xmath53 , whereas @xmath54 could correspond to the subgraph containing only @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "note that @xmath41 is the hamming weight of @xmath45 . since the total number of subgraphs is @xmath56 ,",
    "the above numbering scheme is a one - to - one covering of the subgraph space , and moreover , the subgraphs are labeled in increasing order of @xmath41 .",

    "it is more convenient to transform to a binary representation for the spins as well .",

    "we have @xmath71 so that @xmath72 . therefore :    @xmath73    where @xmath74  stands for the ( mod 2 ) bit - wise scalar product .",
    "the same change can be affected for the bonds by introducing :    @xmath75    so that the binary vector @xmath76 of length @xmath9 specifies whether edge @xmath77 supports a ferromagnetic ( @xmath78 ) or antiferromagnetic ( @xmath79 ) bond . again , @xmath80 , so that :    @xmath81    using eqs .

    "( [ eq:2 ] ) it is now possible to rewrite the boltzmann weight of a particular spin configuration @xmath82 as :    @xmath83    now , the partition function is just the sum over all spin configurations .",

    "this immediately implies that dangling - bond  subgraphs are not included in the sum .",
    "we note that @xmath94 can also be rewritten as a power series in @xmath95 , which is useful for a high - temperature expansion ; this is discussed in app .",

    "it is well known @xcite that there is a connection between knot polynomials and the partition function of the potts spin glass model , a generalization of the ising spin glass model to @xmath152 states per spin : @xmath153 where @xmath154 and @xmath155 ( @xmath47 ) if @xmath156 ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "we first briefly review this connection .    consider a knot embedded in 3d - space ( imagine , e.g. , a piece of rope ) . in the standard treatment @xcite",
    ", the knot is projected onto the plane and one obtains a `` 2d - knot diagram '' .",
    "the essential topological information about the knot is contained in the pattern of `` crossings '' , the 2d image of where one rope segment went over or under another rope segment .",
    "a crossing takes values @xmath158 according to fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] @xcite .",
    "a connection to spin glasses can be made by assigning quenched random values to the crossing variables @xmath159 , so that the links cross above and below at random .",
    "it was shown by nechaev @xcite that in this case the kauffman polynomial is identical , up to an irrelevant multiplicative factor , to the potts model partition function , @xmath160 $ ] . to explain this connection we need to introduce some terminology .",
    "the 2d - knot diagram lives on a lattice @xmath161 composed of lines oriented at @xmath162 , intersecting at the crossings  @xmath159 , that carry the disorder .",
    "one can define a dual lattice @xmath163 , rotated by @xmath164 , so that its horizontal and vertical edges ( denoted @xmath165 ) are in one - to - one correspondence with the vertices @xmath159 of @xmath161 ( fig .  6 in nechaev:98 ) .",
    "let @xmath166the potts spin states @xmath167 are connected to knot properties in an abstract manner ; they are related to the kauffman polynomial variable @xmath88 , which in turn is a weight for the manner in which 2d - knot diagram is disassembled into a set of microstates ( and also related to the jones polynomial variable @xmath168 :  the jones and kauffman polynomials coincide when @xmath169 ) .",
    "precise definitions can be found in @xcite ; for our purposes what matters is that the equivalence of the kauffman polynomial to the potts spin glass partition function is established once one assigns the potts variables @xmath170 and @xmath171 the values @xmath172with these identifications nechaev has shown that the kauffman polynomial ( knot invariant ) @xmath173 where the constant @xmath174 does not depend on the spin states nechaev:98 . solving for @xmath88 we find @xmath175^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath171 can be real only for @xmath176 . in the ising spin glass case ( @xmath177 ) we obtain a complex - valued @xmath178 , which in turn implies complex - valued @xmath179 , and hence the estimation of the qwgt polynomial with complex - valued @xmath124 .",
    "finally , we note that a physically somewhat unsatisfactory aspect of the knots - potts connection is that now the ( complex - valued ) temperature can not be tuned independently from the bonds @xmath4 .",
    "however , this does not matter from the computational complexity perspective : we have established our third main result :    computing the kauffman polynomial at @xmath177 is equivalent to the problem of computing the qwgt polynomial with complex - valued @xmath124 .",

    "hence an efficient quantum algorithm for estimating qwgts will be decisive for knot and graph theory as well .",
    "the connection between qwgts and quantum computational complexity established by kl on the one hand , and the connection between qwgts and the spin glass and knots problems established here on the other hand , suggests that the quantum computational complexity of spin glass and knots problems may be decided via the connection to qwgts .",

    "the author thanks the sloan foundation for a research fellowship and joseph geraci , louis kauffman , emanuel knill , ashwin nayak , and umesh vazirani for useful discussions .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath116 can be included in the hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ eq : h ] ) ] , by adding a term @xmath182 .",
    "we can repeat the analysis above by introducing a fictitious always - up  spin , numbered @xmath47 . in this manner we can rewrite the magnetic field term as @xmath183 where @xmath184 .",
    "the corresponding graph has a `` star '' geometry , with spin @xmath47 in the center , connected to all other spins , which in turn are connected only to spin @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : graphs]c ) .",
    "the analysis above can then be repeated step - by - step , with the relevant subgraphs being those of the star graph .",
    "however , we then can not recover the qwgt form , due to the extra summation over the star - graph subgraphs :  denote the latter @xmath185 .",
    "since each spin in @xmath186 is connected once to the central spin @xmath187 , the star graph subgraphs all have trivial parity vectors , @xmath188 .",

    "( [ eq:7 ] ) is replaced by @xmath189\\cdot s}=2^{|v|}\\delta _ { ( { \\alpha } ^{b}+{\\alpha } ^{b^{\\prime } } , 0)}.\\ ] ] this causes a violation of the condition @xmath190 needed in the definition of the qwgt sum .",
    "thus it appears that qwgts do not include the case with a magnetic field .",
    "another useful representation of eq .",
