    "in the process of high - harmonic generation ( hhg ) high - frequency coherent radiation is emitted from an atom or molecule when exposed to intense femtosecond laser light .",
    "this process has been the subject of extensive studies during the last couple of decades due to possible applications , including , e.g. , generation of coherent uv attosecond pulses  @xcite , carrier - envelope phase retrieval  @xcite and tomographic reconstruction of molecular orbitals  @xcite .    whereas early hhg studies focused on atomic systems , it was not until the new millennium that experimental work on molecules gathered pace .",
    "studies on hhg from molecules is motivated by the expectation that the more degrees of freedom and non - spherical symmetry as compared to atoms may lead to richer physics and a higher degree of control . hitherto the molecules considered have mostly been diatomic or linear systems and it is only just recently that experimental results on hhg from more complicated molecules have become available  @xcite . here",
    "we apply a quantum mechanical three - step model to investigate theoretically hhg from polyatomic molecules of current interest to experimentalists  @xcite . in our theory",
    ", we use a detailed description of the molecular orbitals , obtained from hartree - fock calculations .",
    "we illustrate the effect of orbital symmetry on hhg by studying the orientation dependence of the harmonic signal from ethylene ( c@xmath0h@xmath1 ) .",
    "the methane molecule ( ch@xmath1 ) is used to demonstrate how degenerate homos influence the harmonic spectrum . in particular",
    ", we show the importance of including coherently the contribution from every single homo when calculating the harmonic yield from an oriented molecule .",
    "we demonstrate how the extended and non - spherical molecules propane ( c@xmath2h@xmath3 ) and butane ( c@xmath1h@xmath4 ) give rise to harmonic spectra with a rather complex orientational dependence . in the case of propane harmonics near the cutoff can be selected by orienting the molecule , and since we expect such harmonics to be synchronically emitted  @xcite orientation of propane is identified as a tool for generating attosecond pulses .",
    "it is the first time , to our knowledge , an investigation of the detailed orientational dependence of the single molecule high - harmonic signal from such complex systems is presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ theory ] we derive formulas for the single - particle respons from a system with degenerate homos , and we review the quantum mechanical three - step model used to calculate the harmonic yield  @xcite . in sec .",

    "[ we use atomic units @xmath5 throughout . ]",
    "the complex amplitude for the emission of harmonics with frequency @xmath6 polarized along the linear polarization vector @xmath7 is obtained from the fourier transform of the dipole acceleration @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the expectation value of the dipole operator @xmath10 of the molecule .",
    "the corresponding power density is given by @xcite : @xmath11 the quantum state will be a mixed state , since several unobserved variables appear in a measurement of the harmonic signal .",
    "first , typically several electrons from a given molecule will contribute significantly to the hhg because of degeneracy of the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) .",
    "an experiment recording the total harmonic yield from an ensemble of ground state molecules can not distinguish contributions from the individual degenerate homos .",
    "second , since perfect orientation of molecules is unrealistic , the measured harmonic yield arises from an ensemble of molecules with different orientations . in this section",
    "we treat these unresolved degrees of freedom , using and elaborating the results of recent work  @xcite .",
    "initially , the molecule is in a stationary thermal state at temperature @xmath12 , and the system is completely characterized by the density matrix @xmath13 , with partition function @xmath14 $ ] , @xmath15 the field - free molecular hamiltonian and @xmath16 boltzmann s constant .",
    "we want to resolve the molecular initial state on energy eigenstates .",
    "the molecules we consider are , however , so complex that several simplifying assumptions have to be made in order to obtain a practical theoretical formulation .",
    "according to the born - oppenheimer approximation , we can separate the electron and nuclear motion , and we will assume only the electronic ground state be populated .",
    "next we adapt the single - active - electron ( sae ) approximation , and introduce an index @xmath17 in order to be able to discriminate between the degenerate homos of this active electron .",
    "the nuclear motion consists of rotation and vibration .",
    "we shall assume that only the vibrational groundstate is occupied , whereas the rotation needs to be treated in more detail to take account of an oriented molecule .",
    "in doing so , we neglect the rovibrational interaction such that rotation and vibration can be treated separately .",
    "the rotation is characterized by the asymmetric top quantum numbers @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "we may , accordingly , specify the energy eigenstates by their electronic and rotational degrees of freedom , @xmath20 .",
    "when the system interacts with a laser , the energy eigenstates will evolve according to a unitary operator that describes any number of orienting pump pulses followed by a short , intense laser pulse that drives the hhg [ spontaneous decay processes can be neglected on the timescales we consider ] .",
    "the orientation pulses are not strong enough to affect the electronic motion appreciably  @xcite , while the nuclear dynamic can be considered as frozen during the short high - harmonic generating pulse  @xcite .",
    "thus , if the delay between the final orienting pulse and the driving pulse is denoted by @xmath21 , we can split the time evolution operator according to @xmath22 for a description of the evolution when the hhg is produced , where @xmath23 propagates the electronic part of the molecular state during the pulse of the driving laser and @xmath24 accounts for the evolution of the rotational state of the molecule .",
    "the energy eigenstates then evolve as follows @xmath25 we return to the time evolution of the system in sec .",
    "[ timedevolution ] .",
    "our current goal is to calculate the expectation value of the dipole operator as this enters eqs .   and  .",

    ", the harmonic signal is given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 in general , the degenerate homos will interfere due to the coherent sum over @xmath17 in eq .  .",
    "nevertheless , there are special cases where the degeneracy enters simply as a factor multiplying the signal from a single homo .",
    "for example we mention that if the degeneracy is due to spin multiplicity , @xmath34 , the sum over different homos yields a factor @xmath35 in the signal .",
    "another instance occurs when the homos differ simply by a rotation .",
    "then , in the case of a randomly oriented ensemble of molecules , i.e. , @xmath36 , it is obvious that homos must each give rise to the same complex number when the single homo amplitude , @xmath37 , is averaged over all orientations .",
    "it then follows from eq .   that the degeneracy will again enter as a factor multiplying the signal from a single homo .",
    "as described in the previous section the system starts out in a statistically mixed state composed of the energy eigenstates .",
    "each @xmath20 state evolves according to eq .  .",
    "in this section we focus on the time evolution of the system .",
    "first , propagating the asymmetric top energy eigenstates , @xmath38 , to obtain the @xmath39s at the time @xmath21 of the high - harmonic probing pulse is a numerically demanding task .",
    "the issue has already been addressed in several studies  @xcite , and in the present work , we will assume either @xmath40 to be simply uniform ( no preferred orientation ) or use an idealized orientational distribution to be specified in sec .  [ results ] .",
    "next , we focus on the electronic part of the time evolution . in the field - free initial state",
    "the homo wave function is conveniently expressed in a spherical expansion in the body fixed ( bf ) frame @xmath41 asymptotically this expression must follow the coulomb form @xmath42 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 the ionization potential , @xmath45 the net charge of the molecule when the homo electron is removed and where the @xmath46 s are fitting coefficients . more detail on how to obtain wavefunctions in eqs .   and   is given in sec .",

    "we wish to carry out calculations in a laboratory fixed ( lf ) system defined by the laser polarization , and for a molecule of arbitrary orientation lf and bf coordinate axes do not in general coincide .",

    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows hhg spectra from ethylene at different orientations corresponding to the orientational distributions of eqs .   and  .",
    "the overall effect of orienting the molecule is a scaling of the spectrum .",
    "the reason for this scaling is that all harmonics have similar orientational dependence .",
    "we also note the absence of even harmonics in the spectrum , which is easily explained from the inversion symmetry of the homo of ethylene : the inversion symmetry means that the homo is composed of angular momentum states separated by even multiples of @xmath92 ( see table  [ tab : table1 ] ) . at the same time absorption and emission of laser photons change the size of the electronic orbital angular momentum by @xmath93 , so in order both to start off and end up in one of the angular momentum states of the homo an even number of dipole transitions is necessary .",

    "the homo is inversion symmetric which excludes the presence of even harmonics.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as with propane we observe a complicated behavior of the individual harmonics upon the orientation .",
    "opposite to the case of propane , there is no particular orientation that favors harmonics near the semiclassical cutoff energy .",
    "in the present work we have discussed general issues related to the effects of molecular symmetry , degeneracy and orientation in hhg . to this end , we have considered the high - harmonic signal from several polyatomic molecules , namely ethylene , methane , propane and butane . in the case of ethylene",
    "we have shown how the dependence of orientation reflects the homo : the strength of the harmonics is increased when the laser polarization is directed away from the nodal plane , but the detailed orientational dependence differ from one harmonic to another .",
    "we have used methane as an example of a molecule with degenerate homos .",
    "then harmonic amplitudes of different homos need to be added coherently , and interference effects are in general unavoidable .",
    "although , some information about the individual homos can be extracted by orienting the molecule we illustrated the importance of including all homos when calculating the harmonic signal from one - dimensionally oriented methane .",
    "finally , the propane and butane molecules served as illustrations of hhg from extended structures , and the individual harmonics carry their own characteristic orientational dependence . in the case of propane harmonics near the cutoff can be promoted by means of orientation and a selection of these energetic harmonics is of interest to attosecond pulse generation .",
    "while we expect the conclusions drawn above to be fairly model independent we would like to mention a few open theoretical questions that should be addressed in the near future . in the present paper a relatively simple model using several approximations , including the strong - field approximation and a saddle - point approximation , has been applied to describe hhg .",
    "the model is formulated in length gauge , but at this level of approximation it is still to be settled wether another gauge would be more appropriate  @xcite .",
    "in addition , a future challenge is to take into account the finite duration of the harmonic driving laserpulse .",
    "this is necessary in order to investigate further the possibility of using large molecules as sources of attosecond pulses ."
