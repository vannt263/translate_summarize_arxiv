    "it is widely accepted that the physical conditions for the formation and evolution of stellar clusters can be inferred on basis of embedded clusters structure , which depends on the distribution of dense gas of their original cloud .",
    "numerous clusters embedded in clouds are found in the galaxy .",
    "@xcite suggested that most of them shall lose their dynamical equilibrium , been dissolved in a few tens of myr .",
    "based on the surface density profile of the distribution of members , they proposed two types of cluster structure : centrally concentrated and hierarchical .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the fractal origin of the relations of size and mass distribution in the interstellar gas , determined from clouds surveys in the literature .",
    "more recently , @xcite used hydrodynamic simulations of formation of filaments and protostars , in different initial configurations , aiming to evaluate the statistical properties of embedded clusters in the early star - forming phases .",
    "they found that more substructures are formed by flat density profiles and compressive modes , instead of to produce centrally concentrated profiles .",
    "classical open clusters are characterized by a centrally concentrated surface distribution , whose radial profile is smooth and can be reproduced by a simple power law function . on the other hand ,",
    "hierarchical type clusters show multiple peaks , or substructures in their surface density distribution , like ngc  1333 @xcite , for instance .",
    "more recently , @xcite discussed the structure of this cluster based on _ spitzer _ observations of 137 members , whose surface density map shows an elongated distribution , not centrally concentrated , suggesting a low velocity dispersion and that ngc  1333 is not in virial equilibrium .    in spite of the large number of different clusters found in the galaxy , their relative occurrence remains to be verified , requiring the investigation of clustering properties in a as large as possible sample of studied objects .",
    "for instance , @xcite studied the structure of a huge sample of young stars detected by ray - x observations in the _ chandra _ carina complex project ( cccp ) .",
    "they found three different types of clustering properties in their sample that includes previously known clusters and some additional smaller groups identified by cccp .",
    "the classical , centrally concentrated clusters , present an unimodal stellar distribution .",
    "objects showing several substructures , distributed in a circular boundary , are classified as multimodal clumpy structure , which is suggested to be an unequilibrated stage of cluster formation .",
    "the third type of cluster contains sparse compact groups , without any concentration that is possibly due to triggered star formation .",
    "the effects of ionizing fronts on triggered star formation have been evaluated using numerical simulations by @xcite , for instance .",
    "considering the rapid changes on the spatial distribution of forming stars shown by these simulations , it is expected a strong evolution of the clustering structure , that can be evaluated by the statistical parameter @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "indeed , a rapid change of @xmath0 is noted in the simulations of ionization - induced star formation by @xcite .",
    "however , smooth evolution is also found in the simulations with- and without feedback of ionizing source , depending on the initial conditions @xcite .",
    "based on fractal statistics , in a previous work we discussed the formation and evolution conditions of four young clusters ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fgh12 ) .",
    "the preliminary results revealed that one object of the sample has radial stellar density profile that is not similar to the fractal characteristics of the nearby cloud , in a contrary way of the other three studied clusters .    aiming to validate ,",
    "refine and enlarge our previous investigation of fractal statistics and its possible relation to the initial conditions of cluster formation , in the present work the analysis is extended to a sample of 21 open star clusters , selected according to their youth and intermediate distances .",
    "the clusters were characterized by ( * ? ? ? * hereafter sg12 ) by using near - infrared data to derive their structural parameters based on stellar density maps , similar to the study developed by @xcite , for instance .",
    "the dependence of fractal statistics on age and crossing time was also analysed , aiming to investigate the dynamical evolution that is expected for the star distribution in young clusters , which has been extensively modelled by theoretical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; among others ) .",
    "the results were also compared to the observational studies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , ( * ? ? ? * hereafter pzmg10 ) and @xcite , for instance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sect2 ] is dedicated to present the characteristics of the selected clusters .",
    "section  [ sect3 ] summarizes the adopted methodology , describing the calculations of fractal dimension of clouds , clustering statistics of surface stellar density , and error estimation by using the bootstrap method .",

    "[ sect6 ] .",
    "all the selected young clusters have similar angular sizes ( @xmath2 arcmin ) , and intermediate distances , which is @xmath3 2 kpc for most of the objects .",
    "since the observed e(b - v ) is low , varying from 0.1 to 0.7 , we assume that none of them can be considered an embedded cluster .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] lists the 25 young star clusters analysed in the present work , giving the information available in the literature . for comparison purposes ,",
    "the four clusters previously studied by fgh12 have been included in the sample .",
    "the other 21 clusters have structural and fundamental parameters determined by sg12 .",
    "sg12 used surface stellar density to derive the structural parameters of the clusters .",
    "membership probabilities , evaluated according to proper movement @xcite , were used to identify the very - likely members .",
    "sg12 also adopted color - magnitude filters that enable to separate field - stars from candidate members , which were also included in the total number of objects ( @xmath4 ) used to determine the stellar density maps .",
    "table  [ tab1 ] reproduces the structural parameters obtained by sg12 by fitting the observed radial density profile , based on the empirical model from @xcite : @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the stellar surface density ( stars / arcmin@xmath7 ) , @xmath8 is the average density measured in a reference region ( background ) , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are respectively the density and the radius of the cluster core . the cluster radius ( @xmath11 )",

    "no special trend was found when comparing statistical parameters with mass and age of the clusters from sg12 .",
    "this unexpected lack of correlation is probably due to the similarities observed in their fundamental parameters .",
    "therefore , the analysis of age dependence on cluster structure is better illustrated by comparing the sample with objects spread in a larger range of fundamental parameters values , like the young massive clusters ( ymc ) and stellar associations of milky way and other galaxies , using data available in tables 2 to 4 of pzmg10 , for instance .",

    "intermediate values @xmath46 were found , which correspond more likely to substructures than to smooth radial profiles .    the distribution of fractal dimension @xmath47 ( estimated for the observed clouds ) as a function of @xmath0 parameter ( measured for the clusters ) shows that half of the sample tends to follow a theoretically expected @xmath0 @xmath48 relation , calculated for artificial data @xcite .",

    "it should be expected that these two groups of clusters could have had different virial conditions in the early formation , which are related to different thermal paths : cold collapse for objects centrally concentrated , or warm collapse for those showing substructures @xcite .",

    "other young clusters from literature also coincide with these models .",
    "a slight tendency is observed for objects that have smooth density profile ( @xmath50 ) , like ic  348 and @xmath28 oph , being more similar to the calculation with @xmath51 = 24 stars pc@xmath35 . on the other side , taurus , which shows fractal structure ,",
    "coincides with the @xmath51 = 0.6 stars pc@xmath35 model .",
    "our objects are found in between this range of densities .    the observed distribution of @xmath0 as a function of age",
    "was also compared to the simulations by @xcite assuming different values of virial ratio ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the results are quite similar to the calculations that use @xmath52 , corresponding to  supervirial \" fractal .    since no difference concerning the @xmath0 evolution is noted for our objects , independently if they are fractal or have radial density profile , it is not evident to state if they had or not similar conditions in the early formation .",
    "additional discussions on the cluster formation conditions must include the initial density distribution of parental clouds , as well as the effects of turbulence . according @xcite ,",
    "compressive modes in a flat density profiles tend to form substructures , instead of centrally concentrated distributions of stars .",
    "the fractal dimension calculated for clouds , projected in the direction of the studied clusters , allow us to infer the geometric distribution of the dense regions . a more detailed study on dynamical conditions of the gas",
