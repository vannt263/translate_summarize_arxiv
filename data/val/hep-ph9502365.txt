    "some years ago a possibility was discovered to construct @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theories with vanishing @xmath1-functions of the gauge and yukawa couplings in all orders of perturbation theory ( finite theories ) @xcite .",
    "following the algorithm suggested there , a finite @xmath2 grand unification theory was constructed @xcite . compared to the minimal susy @xmath2 model , this model has three additional pairs of higgs multiplets .",
    "peculiar features of the theory are that each generation of matter interacts with its pair of higgs fields and each type of yukawa interactions is degenerate with reference to generations of fermions or , in other words , only three different yukawa couplings @xmath3 in accordance with three types of interaction between higgses and matter fields exist @xcite . testing finite @xmath2 gut for the compatibility with modern precise experimental data for @xmath4 and proton decay",
    "was performed in @xcite .",
    "as it was shown there , these data could be naturally reproduced within finite @xmath2 gut due to proper choosing the mass splitting of additional multiplets in the higgs sector of the model .",
    "recently , it has been noted that this model can possibly explain hierarchy observed in the fermionic mass spectrum by the hierarchy of vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields @xcite . to check this suggestion ,",
    "it is necessary to solve minimization conditions of the scalar higgs potential , written on the scale of quark masses . from the mathematical point of view",
    "we must solve the system of nonlinear equations , and it is a nontrivial problem owing to a large number of higgs fields .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that this system can be solved analytically .",
    "below we find an exact mathematical solution of minimization conditions and analyze types of extrema .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section is devoted to a review of the main ideas and results of [ @xcite,@xcite ] , and formulae , necessary for what follows , are written .",
    "also , we consider the origin and special features of the scalar higgs potential on the @xmath5 scale . the exact solution of the nonlinear minimization conditions for this potential with respect to the neutral @xmath6 components of higgs fields is offered in section 3 .",
    "the domains of the quantities of the potential for which the extrema , presenting interest for us from the physical point of view , exist are outlined there too .",
    "further , in chapter 4 , we analyze the types of those extremal solutions which are gauge equivalent to real field configurations . and ,",
    "finally , we pick out the extremum which is physically acceptable as the only candidate for a nontrivial absolute minimum of the potential necessary for giving a fermion sector of the theory masses . in conclusion , we resume peculiar features of the potential allowing us to find the solutions of the minimization conditions analytically and to derive explicitly masses of the new higgs particles arising after the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "the obvious phenomenological consequences for relations between quark masses are discussed briefly .",
    "the multiplet contents of the unified theory has been described in @xcite . for our purpose",
    "only its higgs part is important .",
    "it consists of four pairs of chiral superfields @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 in @xmath10 and @xmath11 representations of @xmath2 , respectively , and one chiral superfield @xmath12 in @xmath13 representation which breaks @xmath2 down to @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to higgs superfields , the unified theory includes chiral matter superfields usual for the supersymmetric @xmath2 theory of grand unification @xcite .",
    "they are @xmath15 , @xmath16 , in @xmath11 representation and @xmath17 , @xmath16 , in @xmath18 representation of @xmath2 , where @xmath19 is generation index .",
    "the contents of these superfields have standard form like the susy @xmath2 model @xcite .",
    "reviewing the main ideas and basic formulae of @xcite and conserving the notation used there , we write down the higgs and yukawa parts of the unified finite theory lagrangian as    @xmath20    in all the terms of ( [ 1 ] ) with repeating generation indices we imply sum on them .",
    "the @xmath2 indices are omitted here but they can easily be restored in a covariant manner .",
    "the yukawa constants @xmath21 are expressed in polynomial functions of the gauge coupling @xmath22 through the finiteness conditions [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the lagrangian is written in such a way that only the fourth higgs pair couples with matter like the higgs pair in the minimal susy @xmath2 model while other pairs interact with each generation separately",
    ". the orthogonal matrix @xmath23 mixing them in the higgs generation space will play a very important role in this model .",
    "its presence is not in conflict with the finiteness conditions @xcite and a possibility to introduce it in the theory always exists [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "the unitary matrix @xmath24 is the usual ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "the mass parameters of the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) are not fixed by the finiteness conditions and by doing fine - tuning we can choose @xmath25 and @xmath26 so that @xmath2 should be broken in such way that we will have only three pairs light superhiggs @xmath6-doublets    @xmath27    with opposite hypercharges ( -1 and 1 , respectively ) below the unification scale while the fourth pair higgs @xmath6-doublets and all colour higgs @xmath28-triplets remain heavy with masses having an order of the unification scale magnitude [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "at this mechanism of the @xmath2 violation , these three pairs of light higgs doublets come from those higgs @xmath2-quintets that were coupled with matter generations separately . in view of this ,",
    "the higgs part of the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) after the @xmath2 symmetry violation takes the form    @xmath29 we introduce here the following notation for brevity : @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the @xmath6 indices . ]    excluding the auxiliary components of the gauge and higgs superfields and adding soft supersymmetry breaking terms , we get the scalar higgs potential on the unification scale @xmath32 @xcite :    @xmath33 ,   \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the soft breaking parameters . here and below we use the notation @xmath37 for the low scalar components of the higgs superfields @xmath38 the gauge coupling constants @xmath22 and @xmath39 correspond to the @xmath6 and @xmath40 gauge group of the standard model , respectively . also we denoted for brevity @xmath41 in other terms of ( [ 3 ] ) we imply the convolution of the higgs generation indices as well . the quartic terms in the higgs",
    "scalar potential arise after re - expression of highest components of the @xmath6 and @xmath40 gauge supermultiplets through their lowest dynamical components . in this sense , the situation is completely equivalent to that we have in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . the difference is in that we have three pairs of higgs doublets instead of one in the mssm . it slightly complicates the form of the potential but does not result in principal distinctions .    below the unification scale ,",
    "the finiteness property is absent and all quantities start to renormalize while we are evolving our theory to low energies .",
    "the remarkable property of the theory is that the quartic terms in ( [ 3 ] ) , dictated by supersymmetry invariance , maintain their form from high to low energies , apart from the usual renormalization of the gauge coupling constants @xcite .",
    "the soft breaking of supersymmetry does not alter this persistency property shown by the exactly supersymmetric lagrangian .",
    "on the contrary , the quadratic terms in ( [ 3 ] ) are slightly renormalized from their original form , and on the @xmath5 scale we get @xmath42 .",
    "\\label{4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the spontaneous symmetry breaking to occur , this potential should have nontrivial minimum .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of neutral components of the @xmath6 doublets @xmath43 and @xmath44 will generate masses of fermions .",
    "the beauty of this model is in the minimal influence of the yukawa constants on the mass spectrum of the theory . the main load in the explanation of the observed hierarchy in it lies on the vacuum expectation values of the higgs fields @xcite .",
    "this can be shown in the following way . from the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) of the unified theory we can get supersymmetric yukawa lagrangian on the @xmath32 scale :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 are usual matter superfields like ones in the mssm @xcite , being @xmath6 doublets .",
    "if we reexpress ( [ 5 ] ) in terms of the superfield components , yukawa interactions do not change their form .",
    "one loop radiative corrections do not destroy the degeneracy of the yukawa constants with reference to fermionic generations [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "thus , on the @xmath5 scale quarks and leptons will gain masses @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 are vevs of @xmath54 , @xmath55 , respectively . in view of this , it is especially important to have the exact solution of the minimization conditions of potential ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we shall solve this problem in the next section .",
    "for our purpose , it is convenient to rewrite our @xmath6 invariant potential in terms of the @xmath6 components of scalar higgs doublets : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is necessary for us to find the nontrivial extremum of this potential with reference to neutral components , and conditions which must be satisfied for its existence .",
    "for this aim , we need to solve the system of nonlinear equations @xmath60 where we introduced the new notation for brevity : @xmath61 further , we shall also denote @xmath62    although these equations are written in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the neutral components of @xmath6 doublets , it can easily be seen that they are invariant under the abelian gauge transformations @xmath63 as we can see , this system contains nonlinearity as a quadratic combination , whose square was in the potential ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "it is the key property of system allowing us to solve it analytically . as a first step ,",
    "let us rewrite ( [ 8 ] ) in the matrix form denoting the quadratic combination by @xmath64 : @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the real vectors in the higgs generation space : @xmath67 and @xmath68 is matrix with elements @xmath69 operating in the generation space .",
    "it can be found that @xmath70 below we shall suggest @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 now let us reduce ( [ 9 ] ) to an equivalent system @xmath74 it is obvious that if system ( [ 11 ] ) has a nontrivial solution , the condition @xmath75 should be satisfied .",
    "it is equivalent to @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath78 : @xmath79 we shall have two variants of the solution of the system , depending on what eigenvalue is taken into account .",
    "let us consider both the cases .      in this case",
    ", the system ( [ 11 ] ) has the form @xmath81 solutions of the first and second equations are : @xmath82 the fifth equation of ( [ 15 ] ) puts the restriction on @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , from ( [ 15 ] ) we get @xmath85 on the other side @xmath86 hence , @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 from ( [ 18 ] ) we can easily get @xmath90 using the parametrization @xmath91 we can write the solution of ( [ 15 ] ) for @xmath92 and @xmath93 as @xmath94    it is obvious that if @xmath95 is a solution of the system ( [ 15 ] ) , @xmath96 will be its solution as well .",
    "it is a consequence of the abelian symmetry of equations ( [ 8 ] ) .",
    "we need to replace only the angle @xmath97 in ( [ 20 ] ) on the angle @xmath98 . as it can be seen , all solutions ( [ 20 ] )",
    "are gauge equivalent to the real ones . however , > from the physical point of view , we are interested in the solutions equivalent to the real positive field configurations .",
    "it constrains the matrix @xmath23 , which is a parameter of the theory , because to attain it we must choose such @xmath23 that all components of the vector @xmath99 , around which the matrix @xmath23 rotates all other vectors of the three dimensional generation space , have the same signs .",
    "in addition to these constraints there are others . in order to get real and positive right - hand sides of (",
    "[ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) and to have the potential bounded from below in the direction of vanishing quartic terms in ( [ 7 ] ) , the following conditions should be satisfied : @xmath100 arbitrariness in choosing signs in ( [ 20 ] ) originating from ( [ 17 ] ) is fixed in the following way : we take upper sign if @xmath101 and lower sign in the opposite case . knowing ( [ 20 ] ) we can get from ( [ 15 ] ) @xmath102 it is necessary to have such @xmath103 and @xmath104 that @xmath105",
    ". otherwise we can not make solutions ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) real and positive simultaneously .      in the same manner we can analyze the second variant of the extremal solution when @xmath106 . instead of ( [ 15 ] ) we get : @xmath107 it is easy to show that the solution of the first equation is the vector @xmath92 satisfying the equation @xmath108 this is true for the second equation of ( [ 24 ] ) too .",
    "the general solution of the first two equations is @xmath109 where @xmath110 are some quantities .",
    "the fifth equation of ( [ 24 ] ) puts a constraint on them .",
    "from it we find @xmath111 and @xmath112 to get the real and positive right - hand sides of ( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ 30 ] ) and to have the potential bounded from below in the direction of vanishing quartic terms in ( [ 7 ] ) , the following conditions should be satisfied : @xmath113 arbitrariness in choosing the signs originating from ( [ 28 ] ) must be fixed in complete analogy with the previous case .",
    "introducing parametrization @xmath114 we get from ( [ 29 ] ) @xmath115 @xmath116 we have three free parameters that are the angles @xmath117 the gauge symmetry manifests itself in the following way .",
    "if @xmath118 is the solution of ( [ 24 ] ) , @xmath119 is its solution too .",
    "unlike the @xmath80 case , this case contains extremal configurations which are not gauge equivalent to the real ones .",
    "gauge equivalence to the real field configurations takes place only if @xmath120 : @xmath121 let us note that like in the @xmath80 case , for the solution to have physical interest it is necessary that all real parts in ( [ 36 ] ) have the same signs .",
    "this contradicts an analogous constraint in the @xmath80 case . indeed , as it can be seen from ( [ 25 ] ) , if all components of the vector @xmath99 have the same signs , the coordinates of every point on the plane , orthogonal to it and containing zero point , have different signs .",
    "vice versa , if the coordinates of any point belonging to this plane have the same signs , the coordinates of the vector @xmath99 have different signs . this situation is illustrated fig.1 , where the real solutions of the minimization conditions are depicted .",
    "the solution corresponding to the @xmath80 case lies on the axis in the higgs generation space , around which the matrix @xmath23 performs rotations .",
    "the solution corresponding to the @xmath122 case lies on the circle in the plane orthogonal to this axis .",
    "the angle @xmath97 in ( [ 36 ] ) determines the position of the extremum on this circle . knowing the expressions for @xmath92 and @xmath93 we can obtain from ( [ 24 ] ) the expressions for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "let us note that after the gauge transformation of ( [ 36 ] ) to the real configuration the extremal solution for @xmath125 will become real too .",
    "it can be found by using the following formula @xmath126 if ( [ 21 ] ) , ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) are satisfied , both variants of the solution can occur . to decide",
    "finally which extremum is suitable for us from the physical point of view , we need to determine its type .",
    "however , yet now we can say that the solution corresponding to the case @xmath106 has an additional global symmetry . indeed , if @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the solutions of ( [ 24 ] ) , the field configurations @xmath129 and @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is some orthogonal matrix commuting with @xmath23 , will be solutions of ( [ 24 ] ) as well . breaking this symmetry generates additional goldstone bosons , what will be demonstrated explicitly in the next section .",
    "as it has been noted , we are interested in the extremal field configurations which are gauge equivalent to the real ones . in this case",
    ", the phases of @xmath132 and @xmath133 can be put equal to zero simultaneously , and we get @xmath134 let us determine the type of extrema at these points . to do this , we need to find the eigenvalues of the matrices of second derivatives of the potential ( [ 7 ] ) at this point .",

    "we can observe the same situation considering eigenvalues of the matrices ( [ 39 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) .",
    "having written the matrix of second derivatives of the potential ( [ 7 ] ) at zero , we can see that zero is the saddle point for any sign of @xmath178 ( if the conditions ( [ 21 ] ) , ( [ 22 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) , ( [ 32 ] ) are satisfied ) .",
    "goldstone bosons , which we have in the @xmath80 case , are the results of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "they generate masses of gauge @xmath179-boson ( @xmath149-odd goldstone boson ) and @xmath180 bosons ( charged goldstone bosons ) .",
    "the additional zero eigenvalues in the @xmath106 case correspond to the global symmetry breaking .",
    "as we have written in the previous section , this global symmetry is the symmetry of the potential ( [ 7 ] ) with respect to the rotation of fields in the higgs generation space which is performed by the orthogonal matrices commuting with @xmath23 . taking into account the presence of these additional goldstone bosons",
    ", we may conclude that this extremum is not suitable from the physical point of view . for final conclusion to make",
    ", let us calculate the significance of the potential ( [ 7 ] ) on the extremal configurations .",
    "in both the cases we get @xmath181 then , using ( [ 17 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , we calculate @xmath182 @xmath183 thus , for @xmath176 the absolute minimum of the potential ( [ 7 ] ) is the extremum corresponding to @xmath80 , while zero and extremum corresponding to @xmath106 are the saddle points . in the opposite case , for @xmath177",
    "the absolute minimum is the extremum corresponding to @xmath106 while zero and extremum corresponding to the @xmath80 case are the saddle points .",
    "we must discard the second extremum due to additional goldstone bosons .",
    "taking into account the afore - mentioned arguments and conclusions of the previous section , we summarize that the potential ( [ 7 ] ) has an absolute minimum with respect to neutral components of the @xmath6 scalar higgs doublets , interesting physically , on the field configurations ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) under the following restrictions on the quantities of the potential ( [ 7 ] ) : @xmath184 finally , let us make some remarks regarding extremal field configurations in ( [ 34 ] ) , ( [ 35 ] ) discarded by us in view of their inequivalency to the real ones .",
    "the potential ( [ 7 ] ) on these configurations equals the significance ( [ 57 ] ) , which is greater than the absolute minimum ( [ 56 ] ) .",
    "moreover , if our system is in the vicinity of this extremum , the afore - mentioned global symmetry in the generation space is broken and additional goldstone bosons appear .",
    "the main reason why we have succeeded in the exact solution of the system ( [ 8 ] ) is that this system includes nonlinearity as a whole having the form of a quadratic combination of unknowns .",
    "this type of nonlinearity is generated by quartic terms in the potential ( [ 7 ] ) , which , in their turn , arise after excluding auxiliary non - dynamical components of gauge supermultiplets .",
    "therefore , this form of quartic terms in the potential is typical of the @xmath185 supergravity gut s with enlarged higgs sector @xcite .",
    "the quadratic part of the potential ( [ 7 ] ) has a specific form dictated by finiteness .",
    "this fact allowed us to find the nonlinear combination in ( [ 8 ] ) explicitly .",
    "let us note also that , as it is not difficult to see , our result for absolute minimum configurations ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) is a simple generalization of the analogous result in the mssm @xcite .    in conclusion , we would like to attract attention to the interesting phenomenological predictions for the quark mass spectrum .",
    "after the transition of the system to the absolute minimum ( [ 56 ] ) of the potential on the field configurations ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 23 ] ) , we fix the phases of these configurations to equal zero , and the following relations between up and down quark masses can be observed : @xmath186 quark masses in these relations are running masses and must be taken on the @xmath5 scale [ @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "approximate estimations show that this type of a relation between up and down quark masses can take place @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the hierarchy between quark generations is completely controlled by the matrix @xmath23 that is the parameter of the theory .",
    "parametrizing this orthogonal matrix by three eiler angles @xmath187 , we can get the following hierarchy relations between up quarks : @xmath188 it is clear that we can fit these angles in order to guarantee any hierarchy .",
    "unfortunately , we have not succeeded connecting @xmath23 with other parameters of the theory .",
    "a complete analysis of this model with numerical results for masses of all particles of the theory is in preparation @xcite and will be published elsewhere .",
