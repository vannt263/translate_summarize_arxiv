    "most of the history of the theory of stellar evolution is based on the approximation that stars have spherical symmetry , and are quasi  static objects .",
    "this flies in the face of observations of the surface of the sun , as time  lapse videos of sunspots , eruptions and granulation show , so that the approximation must be stated more carefully as _ spherically symmetric on average . _",
    "the sun is a gravitationally  bound thermonuclear reactor , made of plasma which exhibits turbulent convection in its outer layers . _",
    "spherical symmetry on average _ arises from the cancellation of effects , from the combined action of many chaotic fluctuations such as those which the solar videos capture .",
    "the fortunate approximations of spherical symmetry and quasi - static behavior allow the reduction of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) time  dependent problem to a one dimensional ( 1d ) quasi ",
    "static one , which is amenable to numerical simulation by computer as fifty years or so of progress have shown .",
    "direct simulation of turbulent convection in stars is now feasible , and permits a theoretical study of the solutions to the 3d , time  dependent equations of fluid flow in stars , and consequently a critical re - examination of the spherical , quasi - static approximation for stellar evolution .",

    "the basic idea is to use fine zoning in regions where it is needed and coarser resolution elsewhere . for this to be effective there",
    "must be regions on the grid in which little is happening , so the degree of effectivenes of amr may depend upon the problem being tackled .",
    "for example , turbulence expands to fill the volume allowed , and be a broadly distributed , while in contrast , nuclear burning is highly sensitive to temperature , and may be localized .",
    "extensive theoretical , numerical and experimental information from the geosciences has been analysed by @xcite , for application to the problem of stellar convection and mixing .",
    "given the variety in emphasis , resources , and interests , these 3d simulations are strikingly consistent , which encourages this attempt to explore their implications .",
    "]    qualitatively new and previously overlooked behavior appears in the simulations indicated in table  [ table1 ] and referred to in  [ smethods ] above .",
    "stellar turbulent convection is a strikingly dynamic process @xcite .",
    "this is indicated in fig .",
    "[ ob3d - tke ] , which shows the dynamic onset of convection from a carefully zoned 1d initial model mapped to a 3d grid .",
    "because of the inadequacy of present algorithms for 1d turbulent convection , there is always an initial transient in which convective flow is established .",
    "this is followed by bursts of turbulent kinetic energy , recurring on a time interval similar to the time needed to transit the convective layer .",
    "these bursts encounter stable layers , and drive wave motions ( predominantly gravity modes ) from both boundaries , most obviously from the top .",
    "the boundaries are eroded by entrainment .",
    "both the rate of entrainment , and the amplitude of the waves , are affected by the stiffness of the stable layer ( the value of the brunt - visl frequency ) , and are not some universal constant .",
    "the behavior is also modified by radiative effects , as shown by comparison of the oxygen ",
    "burning shell ( ob ) and the lower boundary of the surface convection zone of a red giant ( rg ) in @xcite , which have significantly different values of the pclet number @xcite .      at present",
    "the highest resolution grids have @xmath15 grid points , which for a 25-nucleus network implies a storage requirement of @xmath16 individual numbers per timestep .",
    "the challenge is to abstract the essential features from this flood of data .",
    "the reynolds - averaged navier  stokes ( rans ) equations provide a systematic way to condense the data and to provide insight for the development of approximate equations to describe it @xcite .",
    "two powerful features of this formulation are that it allows a quantitative evaluation of the sub ",
    "grid dissipation , and it explicitly allows the identification of errors due to inadequate resolution @xcite .",
    "the latter is particularly useful in assessing the numerical quality of simulations of boundaries between turbulent and non - turbulent regions .",
    "there is a balance , on average , between buoyancy and turbulent dissipation @xcite .",
    "buoyancy occurs as a radial acceleration at the largest scales . at the large reynolds numbers typical of stars , the motion is unstable and breaks  up into smaller scale motion , becoming isotropic and losing its 1d character",
    "this continues until the kolmogorov scale is reached , at which point dissipative processes can damp the motion . for these iles simulations",
    "this damping occurs at the sub  grid scale . with sufficient resolution ( e.g. ,",
    "see table  [ table1 ] , @xcite ) , the turbulent cascade is reasonably well approximated .",
    "the largest scale ( the _ integral _ scale ) behaves like the convective roll of @xcite , which is a classic example of a dynamic system with a strange attractor and chaotic behavior @xcite . a combination of the lorenz model and the kolmogorov cascade give a simple but qualitatively consistent representation of the 3d simulation @xcite .",
    "the steady  state limit of this combination gives the _ steady vortex _ model , from which the mixing  length theory ( mlt ) cubic equation of @xcite can be derived @xcite , a process which illustrates the strength and limitations of mlt .",
    "if a steady  state constraint is not imposed , the balance between buoyant driving and turbulent damping is not satisfied instantaneously , but only on average .",
    "because driving and damping occur at widely different length scales , they are not synchronized in time , causing the intermittent pulse behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ ob3d - tke ] .",
    "if the driving is sufficiently strong , an explosion may develop instead of steady  state convection , with the rising plumes becoming rayleigh  taylor ( rt ) unstable and , depending upon the structure , turbulent @xcite .",
    "expansion causes a `` freeze  out '' of the motions @xcite and of the compositional structure , tending toward a spherical explosion ( a hubble flow ) .",
    "convective regions possess a basic up  down asymmetry , which increases with stratification . in a hydrostatic stratification ,",
    "rising material expands because it encounters decreasing pressure , and visa versa . to conserve mass",
    ", rising plumes will tend to be broader and slower than descending plumes .",
    "this difference requires a net downward flux of turbulent kinetic energy ( tke ) @xcite .",
    "this is pronounced in convective atmospheres , which are strongly stratified , containing many pressure scale heights .",
    "net flux of turbulent kinetic energy is assumed to be zero in mlt , but is nonzero and a prominent feature of 3d simulations of stellar atmospheres @xcite .",
    "a key feature of sufficiently resolved 3d simulations @xcite is the development of thin layers which separate regions of potential flow ( non - turbulent ) from those of solenoidal flow ( turbulent ) .",
    "because mlt is a local theory , it has no ability to describe such boundaries . by convention this gap",
    "is addressed by linear stability analysis , resulting in use of the criteria of schwarzschild ( no composition gradient ) and ledoux to define boundaries of mixing . in the geosciences",
    "a more sophisticated analysis leads to various versions of the richardson criterion ( see @xcite ,  10.2.3 ) , which includes both the degree of convective vigor and the stiffness of the stable region .",
    "the richardson criterion is a ratio of the potential energy required to mix a stably stratified layer , divided by the turbulent kinetic energy available to do so .",
    "this preference of a richardson criterion for mixing is supported by the simulations (  3.5 , @xcite ) .",
    "the ledoux criterion only includes the effects of a composition gradient , but not convective vigor , and so underestimates mixing .",
    "this may be why the schwarzschild criterion is preferred over the ledoux .",
    "the schwarzschild criterion ignores the inhibiting composition gradient term , is simpler , and better agrees with astronomical observations .",
    "accurate estimates of _ both _ the composition gradient and the convective speed are needed to define the true mixing boundary .",
    "the mixing of composition in the simulations is advective @xcite rather than diffusion ",
    "like @xcite , and transport is dominated by the large eddies . rising and descending flows have differing composition , giving rise to _",
    "composition currents_. mathematically this reduces the highest order spatial derivative by one : the composition flux is propotional to the composition , not its gradient . in practice",
    "this may result in a qualitatively similar difference operator in 1d @xcite , but caution is suggested in use of the eggleton algorithm . while it is robust and useful for rough surveys , it may be inappropriate for more precise use .",
    "in particular , it may not be the best foundation for introducing rotational effects @xcite .",
    "a better approach might involve using the integral  scale flows and rotation directly @xcite .",
    "as indicated in  [ sintro ] , the validity of the spherically - symmetric approximation for the sun depends upon a cancellation of effects from many turbulent cells acting incoherently .",
    "neutrino emission reduces the thermal time scale relative to the hydrodynamic time scale ( the sound travel time ) , so that it becomes computationally easier to directly simulate the late stages of stellar evolution @xcite",
    ".    as collapse is approached , temperature rises .",
    "neutrino cooling increases , balanced by increased heating from nuclear burning , which gives increased turbulent velocity @xcite .",
    "the increased vigor of convection causes increased fluctuation amplitudes for density as well as tangential velocity .",
    "the core is the least stratified part of the star , so that the convective cells are larger and fewer , giving a less smooth cancellation of chaotic behavior .",
    "as collapse is approached , the equation of state ( eos ) is softer ( the adiabatic exponent @xmath17 ) , so that radial restoring forces decrease , giving larger amplitude fluctuations .",
    "this tendency for dynamic behavior was already indicated in 2d simulations , @xcite . at present ,",
    "pre - collapse progenitor models have spherical symmetry , and no fluctuations or tangential velocities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the simulations , both 2d and 3d , show that these progenitor models represent an extreme and non  physical limiting case .",
    "the problem of inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) is similar to core collapse in that a compression by a large factor ( @xmath18 ) is involved @xcite .",
    "experiments show the extreme importance of slight asymmetries in the initial state prior to compression ; these can modify even the qualitative nature of the flow @xcite , a feature shared with core collapse @xcite .",
    "in addition to changes in shape , 3d simulations also show significant additional changes in time , which also can affect the evolution up to and into collapse .",
    "waves are generated at the convective boundaries ( fig .",
    "[ ob3d - tke ] ) , which give rise to entrainment and mass loss @xcite . for the precollapse stages ,",
    "these waves may not have time to travel to the stellar surface , and they may dissipate along the way . the mass loss may be extensive @xcite , and the dynamics may even lead to eruptions prior to collapse @xcite , as suggested by observations of sniin @xcite . in order to get `` type i '' light curves for snibc supernovae , significant mass loss must occur prior to collapse @xcite ; wave  driven mass  loss and eruptions may be alternatives to binary stripping @xcite .",
    "the 3d morphology of silicon  burning @xcite changes from that of oxygen  burning , because the time scale for nuclear burning approaches the turnover time scale for convective flow .",
    "the further evolution of si  burning to nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) in a convection zone corresponds to a system having both mechanical and thermodynamic degrees of freedom ( see @xcite ,  123 ) , an unexplored theoretical aspect of the approach to collapse indicated by 3d simulations .",
    "core collapse of a massive star leads to the formation of a neutron star or a black hole , but the details of this process have presented continuing difficulty .",
    "@xcite have recently reviewed the physics of core  collapse in 3d .",
    "core collapse simulations add the calculation of neutrino spectrum transport to the computational challenges already in 3d simulations of @xcite , and so can not afford equal resolution .",
    "in addition , core collapse simulations require a star  in  box approach ( see  [ smethods ] ) ; a full @xmath19 geometry is necessary .",
    "the oak ridge group used the chimera code with a @xmath20 grid , and the garching group used the prometheus - vertex code with a @xmath21 grid .",
    "if these were box - in - star simulations , they would both correspond to the low ",
    "resolution examples in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "however , as star - in - box simulations , they correspond to a resolution still coarser by roughly a factor @xmath22 , as only @xmath23 of the stellar volume needed to be simulated in the box  in  star case , with a comparable number of zones .",
    "the star  in  box simulation of @xcite used a grid of @xmath13 points _ and _ a refined numerical algorithm to improve resolution ( see their appendix ) .",
    "for comparison , @xcite used grids of @xmath24 and @xmath25 for satifactory resolution of the solar atmosphere , but in the box  in  star mode ; they computed a @xmath26 mm@xmath27 box ( @xmath28 ) , or @xmath29 of the solar volume .",
    "clearly a star  in  box simulation , which is necessary to represent core collapse , would require additional zones to maintain resolution .",
    "this extreme requirement is softened , but not removed , by the fact that the solar opacity is more temperature dependent that the neutrino opacities ( giving stronger gradients ) , and the solar density gradient is steeper ( requiring more convective cells ) for the solar case .",
    "a comparison of zoning in the ash code is more complex .",
    "@xcite quote a value is @xmath30 for a star  in  box simulation , and state that `` previous simulations did not have sufficient resolution to capture such dynamics '' , which is consistent with the general trend discussed above . with their lower demand on computational resources , 2d simulations might seem tempting , but they are inadequate for turbulent simulations due to the different cascade direction relative to 3d .",
    "the flows are simply different ; see fig .  4 in @xcite .",
    "simulations in 2d is more useful for debugging code ( and ideas ) than describing stars .",
    "the 3d simulations in table  [ table1 ] suggest that bulk features of turbulence are reproduced even in the low  resolution cases , but that more resolution is needed for boundaries .",
    "are the problem areas discussed by @xcite more akin to bulk features or to boundaries ?",
    "region is sensitive to differences in tangential flow @xcite , a feature itself affected by resolution .",
    "the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi , @xcite ) seems more global , and might be captured with even the coarse resolution now used .",
    "the lepton ",
    "number emission asymmmetry ( lesa , @xcite ) may be similar to convection currents seen in o - burning and proton ingestion simulations at higher resolution ( see  [ sresults ] ) .",
    "comparison of fig .  4 in @xcite to fig .  2 in @xcite and fig .  1 in @xcite , all star  in  box simulations",
    ", suggests that higher resolution may be needed for the collapse simulations .",
    "the 3d simulations of pre  collapse stages also have implications for the collapse process .",
    "they suggest that the boundaries may become steeper during the neutrino  cooled stages , as collapse is approached . this would affect core size and density stratification in the progenitor",
    ". it may decrease the rate of accretion on the newly - formed neutron star ; this would reduce the photodisentegration losses which kill the original bounce shock and oppose shock rebirth .",
    "a reduced accretion rate might also result from pre  collapse eruption or extensive mass loss .",
    "it should be stressed that the integral scale turbulence carries the most momentum and kinetic energy , does the most transport , and is the least isotropic .",
    "consequently the isotropy of collapse , or lack thereof , is an important feature .",
    "carbon  burning under conditions of high electron degeneracy begins with a stage of convective instability (  simmering \" ) which temporarily delays the thermonuclear runaway @xcite .",
    "this insures that the runaway begins in a fully 3d and chaotic manner .",
    "the time dependent convection algorithm originally used was similar to that subsequently derived from 3d simulations @xcite . under ",
    "resolved simulations would tend toward laminar flow ( a dipole velocity field ) , but finer zoning results in chaotic , turbulent flow .",
    "the first simulations of the delayed detonation model of thermonuclear supernovae , with detailed nucleosynthesis and relatively high 3d resolution , were done by @xcite , using a @xmath31 grid and the leafs code .",
    "they did not model the ignition phase .",
    "they treated the `` unresolved sub - grid acceleration of flame due to turbulence '' with a sub - grid model , and did nucleosynthesis by tracer particles .",
    "@xcite did pure deflagration models with the same code and grid .",
    "the simmering phase was investigated by @xcite and @xcite using the low - mach code maestro , with grids of @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; maestro allowed time steps which were up to a factor of 18 larger than a compressible code .",
    "after the burning developed , this simulation was then continued with the compressible hydrodynamics code castro , @xcite ; using amr the effective resolution was quoted as @xmath11 .",
    "extension of simulations to investigation of the boundary between core collapse and thermonuclear explosion of one cores @xcite , and to the white dwarf merger channel for snia and merger in general and common envelope evolution @xcite is beginning to be made .",
    "the resolution issue seems particularly acute for mergers because of the steep gradient at the surface of each star ( a boundary problem ) .",
    "there is a deep connection between convection and the rayleigh - tayor instability ( rti ) .",
    "the analysis of the rti leads to differential equations @xcite which are similar to those resulting from analysis of the 3d simulations of turbulence @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "convection starts from a plume which breaks up into the turbulent cascade , and being contained in a given volume , repeats the process ( fig .",
    "[ ob3d - tke ] ) .",
    "the rti begins in a similar way , but is uncontained , so that expansion converts internal energy into kinetic energy by @xmath34 work . in this sense",
    ", the rti is a process of _ convective freeze - out_. the rti converts the initial compositional structure of a supernova progenitor into a supernova remnant , so that the composition , distribution , and velocity of the filaments contain information about both the progenitor and the explosion .",
    "this is why young supernova remnants can be poorly mixed @xcite .",
    "this became clear with cas a @xcite , which showed the previously predicted compositional signature of incomplete oxygen burning  overabundances of si , s , ca as well as o ; @xcite  and the velocity signature of plumes from incomplete overturn",

    "structure is an ongoing challenge @xcite , and one which requires self ",

    "see @xcite for an overview , and @xcite and @xcite for some examples .",
    "this is particularly acute for the stage of core helium burning .",
    "asteroseismology indicates that the real stellar cores during he - burning are significantly larger than those predicted , and that adjustment of parameters which were satisfactorily set during hydrogen burning , is no longer adequate .",
    "large adjustments of these parameters (  overshoot \" ) within the accepted algorithmic framework produces implausible results , but still does not resolve the discrepancy with asteroseismology .",
    "it apprears that a better understanding of the boundary physics during he burning is required .",
    "the 3d simulations indicate that the schwarzschild criterion as normally used will underestimate the size of the mixing region , and this error may be exacerbated by the opacity behavior of the he  burning ashes .",
    "h - burning produces he , which reduces the opacity ; he  burning produces c and o , which increase the opacity .",
    "an increased opacity tends to increase convective mixing and core size , so that there may be positive feedback on mixing during core he burning .",

    "<S> the numerical simulation of turbulence in stars has led to a rich set of possibilities regarding stellar pulsations , asteroseismology , thermonuclear yields , and formation of neutron stars and black holes . </S>",
    "<S> the breaking of symmetry by turbulent flow grows in amplitude as collapse is approached , which insures that the conditions at the onset of collapse are not spherical . </S>",
    "<S> this lack of spherical symmetry has important implications for the mechanism of explosion and ejected nucleosynthesis products </S>",
    "<S> . numerical resolution of several different types of three  dimensional ( 3d ) stellar simulations are compared ; it is suggested that core collapse simulations may be under - resolved . </S>",
    "<S> new physical effects which appear in 3d are summarized . </S>",
