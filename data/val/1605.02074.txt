    "we parametrize the gas gap depletion as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the gas surface density in the gap and @xmath12 is the undepleted value extrapolated from the outer disk .",

    "azimuthal variations inside the gap , for example accretion streamers connecting the gap edge to the planets or the star @xcite , may account for some remaining gas , though current data generally lack the needed angular resolution to resolve these structures .    the current observed @xmath16 span 10 - 1000 , but we do not yet have a large enough sample to understand the selection effects . below we will use @xmath32 as a conservative requirement for our planet - opened gaps and also assess our results for @xmath33 and 1000 .",

    "the repulsion is so strong with the fiducial value of @xmath131 g @xmath122 that the planets can not maintain a common gap for 1 myr .",

    "potentially gas outside the common gap could resist the resonant repulsion , but we do not expect this mechanism to be effective for configurations explored here . we expect the timescale to clear a new gap to be much less than the repulsion timescale so that the gap effectively moves with the planet , rather than the gas pushing the planet back toward the gap center . furthermore , only a thin ring of gas with width on the order of the distance moved by the planet , typically a few au , is expected to strongly interacts with the planet . the total mass in that gas ring is expected to be much smaller than the combined mass of the planets responsible for the repulsion .",
    "however , hydrodynamical simulations are necessary to fully explore the effect of the gas outside the common gap on resonant repulsion and the dependence on disk parameters .",

    "we will use the term libration to refer to both true libration where the amplitude is bounded and angles that spend most of their time bounded but technically circulate through all values . in fig .",
    "[ fig : app13 ] row 3 , column 4 is an example of the former and column 1 of the latter . for every configuration ( table [ tab : res ] , column 3 ) gas damping drives one or more pairs into libration of the 2:1 resonance .",

    "other resonances , such as the 3:2 mean motion resonance , librate for a subset of configurations ( e.g. , fig .",

    "we find that the mean motion and three - body resonances generally persist after gas damping shuts off ( table [ tab : res ] , final column ) .",
    "many pairs exhibit libration of the separation of periapses @xmath152 . unlike libration of the 2:1 resonance , libration of @xmath152 is not necessarily a signature of dissipation , particularly for the more widely - spaced planets , because much of the parameter space can librate for hierarchical systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we note that although all configurations feature libration of a resonant argument , not all feature period commensurabilities ( 3 - 10cd , 4 - 2 ) and for many , a different resonant argument is librating than the commensurability .",
    "for example , the inner pair in 3 - 5 ( fig .",

    "many systems featuring libration of the 2:1 argument do not feature 2:1 commensurability .",
    "this poses a challenge for comparing to observations because the damped eccentricities are small ( a few percent or less ) , making it difficult to measure @xmath110 and hence determine whether resonant arguments are librating .",
    "we run additional simulations with @xmath113 ( migration ) and @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( precession ) imposed in addition to @xmath112 but find the same qualitative behavior .",
    "migration can enhance or undo resonant repulsion but requires fine tuning .",
    "for example , recall that in configuration 4 - 10a , the system went unstable with too little gas but repelled each other excessively with too much gas .",
    "migration can counteract the repulsion ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mig ] ) .",
    "however , the migration rate ( @xmath153 ) must be positive for the innermost planet and negative for the other planets .",
    "we fine - tuned the migration timescale to 0.9 myr for the outer three planets and 9 myr for the inner planet . for either type i or type ii migration",
    ", we generally expect the migration timescale to increase with semi - major axis , so these rates would require fine - tuning of the disk conditions to produce the required magnitude and direction of migration .    in principle",

    "however , in practice the precession timescale is slow to make a difference : on a 1 myr timescale , the systems are destabilized by resonant and synodic planet - planet interactions rather than secular planet - planet interactions .",
    "for example , without precession caused by an outer disk , a simulation in the 4 - 10d configuration with @xmath154 g@xmath122 went unstable on a timescale of 0.95 myr and thus barely failed our stability criterion .",
    "next we approximated the outer disk as a 10 jupiter mass ring at 50 au and added the precession to each orbit caused by this ring to each planet . ] .",
    "the system goes unstable on a similar timescale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : precess ] ) . on a much longer timescale than considered here",
    ", a remnant planetesimal disk could affect the system s stability ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but this does not affect the requirements for the gas disk stage .",
    "in this section , we consider the occurrence rates of giant planets at large separations , i.e. , those that could be the survivors of young planetary systems that sculpted transitional disks in the gas disk era .",
    "we compare their occurrence rates ( section  [ sec : fplanet ] ) to the occurrence rate of transitional disks to determine whether there are enough giant planets to account for the occurrence rate of transitional disks ( section  [ sec : fplanetvsftd ] ) .",
    "finally , we connect the initial conditions of the multi - planet systems at the beginning of the post - gas - disk era to the observed properties of these systems at older stages ( section  [ sec : disrupt ] ) .    as shown in section  [ sec : planetrequirements ] and [ sec : stability ] , multiple giant planets with @xmath155 separated by @xmath53 - 6 @xmath104 are necessary to open a common gap as seen in transitional disks and usually get locked into mean motion resonance and are stable for as long as the gas disk is around ( a few myr ) .",
    "such configurations may go unstable sometime after the gas disk dissipates so we can not assume that the resonant chains persist until today . instead , we conservatively assume that systems with giant planets in a wide range of configurations today may have produced transitional disks early in their history .    thoroughly following the evolution of systems similar to those we simulated in section  [ sec : stability ] for gyr after the dissipation of the gas disk is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "of those ten , three went unstable during the gas disk stage , three went unstable throughout the star s lifetime ( at 63 myr , 541 myr , and 1.0 gyr ) , and four remained stable for 10 gyr .",
    "the seven systems that did not go unstable during the gas disk stage each feature between one and three ( out of four ) pairs within 10% of 2:1 commensurability ( with the other pairs within 20% of commensurability ) .",
    "a detailed study of the post - gas stability timescales established by the configuration during gas disk stage is beyond the scope of this paper , but we preliminarily conclude that the resonant configurations sometimes survive to the present day but sometimes are disrupted on a wide range of timescales .",
    "future studies could account for the range of gas disk lifetimes and the gradual dissipation of the gas disk , thoroughly determine the distribution of resonant disruption timescales , and focus on configurations that fulfill the more stringent constraints on @xmath16 expected from ongoing alma observations .",
    "we investigated the hypothesis that transitional disks are common gaps opened by multiple giant planets .",
    "we first synthesized the properties of the extended gaps in transitional disks based on alma gas observations ( section  [ sec : gapproperties ] ) and defined the multi - planet systems that can account for these properties ( section  [ sec : planetrequirements ] ) .",
    "a series of minimally - packed planetary systems were constructed ( table  [ tab : planetarysystems ] ) , and their stability was explored using @xmath0-body simulations ( section  [ sec : stability ] , table  [ tab : stability ] ) .",
    "we then compared the occurrence rate of transitional disks , @xmath35 , with the extrapolated occurrence of giant planets at large separations , @xmath160 and considered the subsequent dynamical evolution of the systems beyond the gas disk era ( section  [ sec : statistics ] ) .",
    "our main conclusions are :    1 .   to open a wide and deep gas gap around a solar type star consistent with observations , a system of 36 giant planets is indeed . the minimum planet mass increases with increasing disk scale height @xmath42 and viscosity @xmath43 ( as gaps become more difficult open ) , and increasing gap depth ( table  [ tab : mplimit ] )",
    "the total number of planets inside a gap depends on the gap size : the planets must be placed close enough together to open a common gap . for given set of gap and disk properties , the less massive the planets , the larger the number and the closer the placement ( table  [ tab : planetarysystems ] ) .",
    "2 .   in general , without the aid from the gas damping , systems with a smaller number of more massive planets tend to be dynamically stable for the typical disk lifetime , while systems with a larger number of less massive planets may be unstable .",
    "eccentricity damping from the residual gas inside the gaps can help stabilize systems by locking planets into mean motion resonances , establishing a chain of pairs resembling the older hr 8799 system @xcite .",
    "however , in some cases eccentricity damping induces resonant repulsion that can drive planets away from commensurate period ratios , resulting in planets that are technically in resonance but not easily identifiable as such .",
    "[ con : stability ] 3 .   the giant planet occurrence rate at wide separations @xmath160 must equal or exceed the occurrence rate of transitional disks @xmath196 for the planet - opening - common - gap scenario to remain viable .",
    "this can only be satisfied under some of the most favorable conditions explored here , namely , @xmath187 and @xmath204 in the gap regions ; more importantly , the occurrence rate of giant planets at @xmath5150 au has to largely follow the radial velocity statistics @xcite , not the direct imaging statistics @xcite .",
    "this situation may be significantly mitigated if the disk viscosity is lower than @xmath205 , enabling low mass planets to open gaps through non - linear wave damping processes ( see discussion in section  [ sec : alpha ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath206 under the most favorable conditions here ( @xmath106 , @xmath70 , @xmath32 ) implies that transitional disks are not a universal , fast disk dispersal phase at the end of protoplanetary disks lifetimes , as assumed by most previous work dating back to @xcite .",
    "instead , the rarity of giant planets at large separations requires ( 1 ) most ( if not all ) giant planets to be at work in transitional disk sculpting in gaseous disks , ( 2 ) the transitional disk phase to be long - lasting , with a timescale comparable to typical disk lifetime , and ( 3 ) that only a small fraction ( @xmath207 ) of protoplanetary disks undergo this phase .",
    "if @xmath35 increases with cluster age , the dependence reflects the time scale of giant planet formation instead of disk clearing.[con : fpvsftd ] 5",
    ".   the formation time scale for giant planets must be short ( i.e. , compared to the gas disk lifetime ) so that they carve and maintain gaps for most of the disk lifetime .",
    "hl tau , if its gaps are opened by giant planets , would be an example of fast planet formation ; the system is believed to be @xmath208 myr based on the youth of the taurus cluster @xcite . 6 .   as a consequence of the dynamical evolution of the multi - giant - planet systems inside the gaps , and the fact that most giant planets at large separations must participate in sculpting transitional disks in the gas disk era , most multi - giant systems have to be in mean motion resonances at the end of the gas disk era .",
    "the fraction of systems in resonance should decrease with time in the post gas disk era .",
    "the properties of transitional disks serve as a helpful check - point for the `` initial '' ( i.e. , post gas - disk ) conditions of giant planet systems .",
    "this subsequent evolution , for which the initial conditions have been a major source of uncertainty , is thought to play a major role in establishing the observed eccentricity distribution and spawning hot and warm jupiters through subsequent tidal evolution from highly elliptical orbits ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we re - emphasize that these conclusions only hold if the planetary sculpting hypothesis is responsible for most transitional disks , a mechanism with footings in both theory and observations ( section  [ sec : intro ] ) , and in particular , supported by the recent detection of three companions inside lkca  15 s wide gap @xcite .    in drawing these conclusions",
    ", we made a couple assumptions that simplified the analysis without losing much generality .",
    "we assumed a single planet mass for each configuration and when comparing @xmath160 to @xmath35 , we did not take into account the different distribution of stellar masses in the samples .",
    "the current limited sample sizes of transitional disks and giant planets at large separations do not permit a detailed @xmath160@xmath35 comparison by subgroups .",
    "[ sec : visc ]    the tension between @xmath160 and @xmath35 can be significantly mitigated if the disk viscosity is lower than @xmath205 .",
    "for a given @xmath16 and @xmath42 , lower @xmath43 leads to a lower gap opening planet mass limit and thus more planets potentially capable of opening gaps .",
    "at least at close separations , the planet occurrence rate increases with decreasing planet mass @xcite .",
    "limited by the availability of the large systematic sets of gap opening simulations used to constructed our multi - planet systems @xcite , we did not go below @xmath209 and @xmath106 .",
    "however , while @xmath42 can hardly go any lower than 0.05 , the tension between @xmath160 and @xmath35 suggests that @xmath43 , a quantity that is hard to measure observationally and whose nature is not well understood theoretically , may span lower values in reality",
    ". we will argue below that a lower @xmath43 can be consistent with recent observational and theoretical work .    as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , alma observations have found that the mm continuum ring in a few transitional disks is asymmetric ( lopsided ) , with most of the emission coming from only one side of the disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one interpretation is that these asymetric features result from vortex formation at the edge of planet - induced gaps , generated by the rossby wave instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and dust trapping in vortices ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a key ingredient in this scenario is a low viscosity .",
    "as @xcite pointed out , @xmath210 is required to form vortices at the gap edge .",
    "other observational evidence comes from alma gas disk observations .",
    "first , non - detections of non - thermal motions induced by disk turbulence in a few systems suggest low viscosity . for example , based on alma co observations of hd  163296 , @xcite determined that the level of turbulence in this disk is lower than @xmath211 of the local sound speed , which implies @xmath212 .",
    "second , through detailed modeling of the gas gap structures and comparing with simulations of gap opening , @xcite also proposed @xmath210 inside the gap of a few transitional disks .    on the theory side , low @xmath43 in protoplanetary disks",
    "has recently gained some footing .",
    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) has been put forward as a prime candidate to provide disk viscosity .",
    "the operation of the mri requires the disk to be sufficiently ionized and well coupled to the magnetic field . in the part of the disk that these conditions are not satisfied , a deadzone with no mri and low viscosity",
    "is expected @xcite .",
    "magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) simulations and chemical disk modeling have shown than non - ideal mhd effects , in particular ambipolar diffusion , can significantly suppress mri in disks at tens of au , resulting in very low viscosity equivalent to @xmath212 at the bulk of the disk @xcite .",
    "the gap opening process in an extremely low viscosity environment with @xmath212 is different from the viscous disk case ( i.e. , the @xcite models used here ) , as the gap is now opened by nonlinear evolution , instead of the viscous damping , of waves . nonlinear evolution of waves was explored by @xcite and @xcite , who predicted that even planets much less massive than the thermal mass , @xmath213 ( about saturn mass at 15 au ) , can open gaps .",
    "their theory was later confirmed by numerical simulations of disk - planet interactions in ( nearly ) inviscid disks @xcite .",
    "we note that gap opening by low mass planets in nearly inviscid disks can be slow ; it has not yet been explored whether the timescale is consistent with observed disk lifetimes .",
    "finally , if future observational and numerical studies demonstrate that disk viscosity is generally very low ( e.g. , @xmath214 ) , _ and _ this low viscosity enables earth and super - earth - like planets to participate in the transitional disk sculpting processes , _ and _ the abundance of such planets found by kepler ( e.g. , @xcite ) extends to tens of au , we caution that the conclusion made in section  [ sec : fplanetvsftd ]  namely the @xmath207 occurrence rate of transitional disks reflects nature not nurture  may be altered .      in this paper",
    "we discussed gaps with @xmath32 , a conservative limit set by most current observations , as well as @xmath32 and 100 , more aggressive limits put forward by pioneering studies with the latest alma results @xcite .",
    "as additional attenae are commissioned for alma , future observations with finer angular resolution and better sensitivity may systematically push @xmath15 to as high as @xmath215 .",
    "if such a large depletion is confirmed , even with the most gap - friendly disk properties in our models ( @xmath70 and @xmath106 ) and rv planet statistics at large separations , there may not be enough giant planets capable of opening such deep gaps to account for @xmath35 ( table  [ tab : mplimit ] ) .",
    "therefore the planetary sculpting hypothesis would only be viable for the ultra - low viscosity @xmath212 discussed in section  [ sec : visc ] and not considered in the configurations explored in the paper .",
    "as we concluded most giant planets have to be at work in gap opening , stars with more ( fewer ) giant planets should show a higher ( lower ) @xmath177 and @xmath35 .",
    "this expected correlation is tentatively supported by the data for different stellar masses ( section  [ sec : fplanetvsftd ] ) .",
    "future measurements of @xmath35 and @xmath160 for subgroups of stars can further test this prediction .",
    "we concluded that most giant planets had to participate in gap opening when they were in protoplanetary disks and gas damping established stable resonant configurations .",
    "for some configurations ( particular those with four or more massive planets ) , the period ratios are commensurate and the system could be identifiable as a resonant configuration .",
    "the young hr  8799 , with all four planets likely in a chain of 2:1 resonances @xcite , is an excellent example . for other configurations ( particularly those with only three planets )",
    ", we found resonant repulsion drives the planets away from recognizable commensurability .",
    "we found that each of the configurations we studied features libration of the 2:1 resonant argument and many feature libration of three - body resonances ( e.g. , laplace ) .",
    "the resonance librations persist after gas damping shuts off but may be difficult to measure from observations because the eccentricities are small .",
    "after the protoplanetary disk phase , the fraction of multi - giant systems in resonance is expected to decrease over time ( section  [ sec : disrupt ] ) , a prediction that can be more robustly tested in the future with a sample planets whose host stars have well - determined ages that span multiple orders of magnitude .",
    "the two major ongoing direct imaging surveys with vlt / sphere @xcite and gemini / gpi @xcite are expected to establish much better statistics of giant planets at tens of au from the star , resolving the question of whether giant planets are sufficiently common for planetary sculpting to be predominant cause of transitional disks .",

    "several years ago , @xcite reported a correlation between stellar chromospheric age ( based on h and k emission lines ) and orbital resonances .",
    "they found that systems containing detected giant planets with period ratios near 2:1 are younger ( median age 4.08 gyr ) than those without ( median age 6.23 gyr ) .",
    "using a permutation test , they found a 0.4% probability that such a difference would occur by chance . in order to believe this result is not due to chance",
    ", we need a viable alternative hypothesis that yields a higher probability for the age difference . below we provide two such alternative hypotheses and make connections to the outcome of the dynamical processes studied in section  [ sec : stability ] .",
    "first we consider the hypothesis that initially a fraction @xmath216 of giant planet systems begin in resonance and exponentially  decay \" out of resonance on a characteristic timescale resonant disruption timescale @xmath217 .",
    "we compute the probability of stellar ages for resonant systems @xmath218 , of which there are @xmath219 in @xcite sample , and non - resonant systems @xmath220 , of which there are @xmath221 , as @xmath222 , \\label{eqn : prob}\\\\      { \\rm prob_{res } } ( t_\\star)= \\exp \\left(-t_{\\star , \\rm res}/t_{\\rm res}\\right ) \\label{eqn : probres}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we contour the probability in fig .",

    "the maximum probability occurs for @xmath223 and @xmath224 gyr and is about 22 times higher than the probability of @xmath225 and @xmath226 ( i.e. , such that systems are non - resonant by nature , not nurture , and the difference in age is due to chance ) .    to choose between the chance hypothesis as an explanation for the data and the hypothesis that all systems start out in resonance and",
    "are disrupted on a character 3 gyr timescale , we also need to consider which is more likely a priori .",
    "our section  [ sec : stability ] and  [ sec : statistics ] results allow us to weigh in .",
    "the @xcite sample has smaller semi - major axes than the configurations studied here ( e.g. , their observed sample of 2:1 resonant pairs have a median @xmath227 au for the outer planet , whereas our configuration 5 - 2b , which features 2:1 commensurabilities , has its innermost planet at 2.4 au ) .",
    "however , the processes we study here may apply to planets at smaller semi - major axes , extending in to the period valley ( e.g. , @xcite ) at 0.8 au .",
    "their sample of 2:1 resonant planets have masses @xmath228 , similar to the masses in our configurations of planets with recognizable commensurabilities ( table [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "we favor a high @xmath216 because nearly all giant planets must participate in the transitional disk stage ( section  [ sec : fplanetvsftd ] ) and the planetary systems that can account for observed transitional disk properties are often configured in resonant chains ( section  [ sec : stability ] ) .",
    "however , in our case study of long - term evolution ( section  [ sec : disrupt ] ) , we did not find a typical resonance disruption timescale of 3 gyr ; instead , we found the timescales spanned many orders of magnitude .",
    "nonetheless , we do find that long resonance disruption timescales of @xmath5 gyr are possible ( section  [ sec : disrupt ] ) , in contrast to other types of processes that would primarily operate on shorter timescales ( e.g. , interactions with a remnant planetesimal disk , @xcite ) .    since our case studies leads us to expect a range of resonant disruption timescales spanning magnitude",
    ", we consider a third hypothesis that replaces eqn .",
    "[ eqn : probres ] with a truncated log - uniform distribution @xmath229 dx \\label{eqn : probres2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we plot the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : res2 ] .",
    "the maximum probability occurs for @xmath223 and @xmath230 gyr and is about four times higher than the probability of @xmath225 and @xmath231 ( i.e. , such that the difference in age is due to chance ) .    based on the assessment here ,",
    "it is unclear whether the average younger ages stellar age of 2:1 resonant planets is due to chance or a manifestation of resonance disruption .",
    "the hypothesis that all systems begin in resonance and are disrupted on a timescale that happens to fall within to the ( single order of magnitude ) range of ages in the sample is best at explaining the age difference but unlikely a priori . an alternative hypothesis  that most planets start out in resonance but that resonances are disrupted on log uniform range of timescales  is more likely a priori from the results of our study but not a clear winner over random chance .",
    "to better study resonance disruption empirically , we need a sample with a wide ( multiple orders of magnitude ) range of stellar ages and reliable stellar age uncertainties ."
