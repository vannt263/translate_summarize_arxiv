    "since the discovery of superconductivity in the cuprates @xcite , enormous theoretical and experimental effort has been made to investigate the superconducting pairing mechanism which leads to an unprecedented high transition temperature @xmath0@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the generic phase diagram of the cuprates shows a wide variety of different behavior as a function of temperature and level of hole doping . in particular , with increasing hole doping away from half - filling , the physical properties completely change at the transition to the superconducting phase .",
    "a large number of experiments using angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) have revealed a strong momentum dependence of the superconducting gap@xcite-@xcite .",
    "an additional puzzle is the unknown connection between the superconducting gap of the superconducting phase and the so - called pseudogap which is a central property of the most unusual normal state of the cuprates .",
    "superconductivity is usually understood as an instability from a non - superconducting state .",
    "therefore , often in theoretical investigations , the starting point was either the fermi - liquid or the anti - ferromagnetic phase at large or low doping . in this paper , we take a different approach and only consider hole fillings , in which either a superconducting or a pseudogap phase is present .",
    "a generally accepted model for the cuprates is the @xmath1-@xmath2 model which describes the electronic degrees of freedom in the copper - oxide planes for low energies .",
    "alternatively , one could also start from a one - band hubbard hamiltonian as a minimal model .",
    "however , for low energy excitations , the latter model reduces to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , so that both models are equivalent . in a preceding paper @xcite , henceforth denoted by i",
    ", we have investigated the pseudogap phase in the cuprates on the basis of the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "our aim is to extent the microscopic approach from paper  i to the superconducting phase .",
    "as our theoretical tool , we use a recently developed projector - based renormalization method which is called prm @xcite .",
    "the approach is based on a stepwise elimination of high - energy transitions using unitary transformations .",
    "we thus arrive at a renormalized free hamiltonian for correlated electrons which can describe both the superconducting phase and the pseudogap phase . for the superconducting phase , the order parameter turns out to have @xmath3-wave symmetry with a coherence length of a few lattice constants . the basic feature for",
    "the understanding of the superconducting pairing mechanism in the underdoped regime is a characteristic electronic oscillation behavior between neighboring lattice sites .",
    "the oscillation becomes less important for larger @xmath4 which agrees with the weakening of the superconducting phase for larger hole doping .",
    "the spectral function , obtained from angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) along the fermi surface , also agrees well with experiment : the spectra display peak - like structures which are caused alone by coherent excitations in a small range around the fermi energy .    after a short introduction of the model in sec .",

    "it hops back to the first site , since this site was certainly empty after the first hop .",
    "thereby , the presence of short range antiferromagnetic correlations in the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath15 is crucial , since it prevents the hopping to more distant sites .    in order to derive an approximate gap equation ,",
    "let us again start from eq .  .",
    "when we restrict ourselves to a weak coupling theory , the @xmath29-dependence of @xmath63 and @xmath228 can be neglected : @xmath229 where the first term from eq .   was already omitted . for a purely qualitative discussion of the gap parameter ,",
    "let us abandon all higher order renormalization effects , which would be included in the full renormalization scheme of sec .",
    "[ re - app ] . inserting the former expression for @xmath230 into eq .",

    "moreover , by replacing on the left hand side also @xmath236 by @xmath196 , we arrive at the following approximate gap equation @xmath237 note that the main features of our numerical results for the full renormalization scheme can already be detected from this equation . due to the doping dependence of @xmath238 , shown in fig .  9 of paper i , superconductivity sets in at the same small @xmath4-value , at which @xmath239 becomes non - zero . with increasing hole doping , @xmath239 increases , which also leads to a strengthening of the coherent excitation in @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , superconductivity is favored for low doping due to the factor @xmath240 in the denominator of eq .  .",
    "both features together , i.e.  the increase of @xmath239 with @xmath4 and @xmath240 lead to a maximum of @xmath0 at a finite doping value which is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig_15 ] .",
    "the property @xmath240 also explains the decrease of @xmath0 in the overdoped region , since renormalization processes become weaker for larger @xmath4 .",
    "the preference of the prm to find solutions with @xmath3-wave symmetry for the gap parameter can also be understood from the gap equation .",

    "finally , let us discuss the arpes spectral function in the superconducting phase .",

    "the spectra in both panels display peak - like structures in a small energy range around @xmath262 .",
    "note that all structures are caused alone by the coherent part of @xmath119 ( first line in eq .  ) , which consists of two peaks at the positions @xmath263 .",
    "for @xmath171-vectors , far away from the fs ( top and bottom plots in figs .",
    "[ fig_17](a ) and ( b ) ) , a dominating peak at @xmath264 is found , which arises from the excitations at @xmath265 , depending on the sign of @xmath266 . by approaching the fs ,",
    "a secondary peak arises at @xmath267 .",
    "an expansion of the prefactors in eq",
    ".   shows that in each case the secondary peak has a smaller weight of order @xmath268 . only for @xmath171-values on the fs ( @xmath269 ) , the two coherent peaks have equal weight",
    "they are separated by an energy distance , which is given by the gap parameter @xmath270 .",
    "note that the gap size is almost the same for the two cases of fig .",
    "[ fig_17 ] .    a comparison of both panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_17 ] also shows that the secondary peak is more pronounced in the anti - nodal region than in - between the anti - nodal and nodal region .",
    "furthermore , the overall dispersion of @xmath271 of the primary peak is weaker in the anti - nodal region than for the case of intermediate @xmath258-values . with respect to the incoherent contributions to @xmath119 , note that for optimal doping the overall weight of the coherent and of the incoherent excitations are approximately the same .",
    "however , the incoherent part of the spectrum is spread over a much larger frequency range",
    ". therefore , in a small @xmath272-range , close to the fermi level , the coherent excitations are dominant .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_18 ] , the spectral function is plotted in the nodal region for fixed @xmath273 and different values of @xmath259 .",
    "thereby , again the fs is crossed .",
    "note that neither a secondary peak nor a superconducting gap is found in the nodal region .",
    "also , the coherent peak moves almost unchanged through the fs , when @xmath259 is varied .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig_19 ] shows the results for the symmetrized spectral functions @xmath119 for two different temperatures ( a ) @xmath274 ( superconducting phase ) and ( b ) @xmath275 ( pseudogap phase ) .",
    "the @xmath276-values proceed on the fs between the nodal ( top ) and the anti - nodal ( bottom ) point .",
    "the hole concentration is @xmath191 ( underdoped regime ) which leads to a critical temperature @xmath277 . in the spectra at temperature @xmath155 ,",
    "one recognizes the opening of a superconducting gap for all @xmath276-vectors except at the nodal point .",
    "the gap size as a function of the fermi surface angle @xmath190 is given by the blue line in fig .",
    "[ fig_11 ] .",
    "similar as before , the peak - like structure arises from the coherent excitations in a small @xmath272-range around @xmath262 . for the higher temperature , @xmath278 ( pseudogap phase ) , the system is in the normal state . on a substantial part of the fermi surface ,",
    "the spectra now show the typical large spectral weight around @xmath279 , indicating a fermi arc of gapless excitations .",
    "the fermi arc extents over a finite @xmath171-range .",
    "in contrast to the superconducting case , the spectrum is now dominated by the incoherent excitations . in the anti - nodal region",
    ", they form the pseudogap around @xmath279 ( see also paper i ) .",
    "note that the pseudogap in fig .",
    "[ fig_19](b ) is about ten times larger than the superconducting gap at @xmath274 ( for the present hole doping @xmath280 ) .",
    "note that for both temperatures , the spectra are in good qualitative agreement with recent arpes measurements@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "let us finally make one remark concerning the linewidth of the coherent peaks . as was already mentioned in sec .",
    "v of paper i , from the experimental point of view , we would expect a temperature dependent broadening of the coherent peaks which is caused by the coupling to other degrees of freedom .",
    "such a broadening was not incorporated in the present approach .",
    "note , however , that a broadening of the spectra is also produced by the incoherent excitations of @xmath119 . in order to include a temperature dependent broadening of the coherent excitations ,",

    "[ fig_19 ] , which is taken of the order of @xmath281 .",
    "in this paper , we have given a microscopic approach to the superconducting phase in cuprate systems at moderate hole doping .",
    "thereby , a recently developed projector - based renormalization method ( prm ) was applied to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model .",
    "our result for the superconducting order parameter shows @xmath3-wave symmetry with a coherence length of a few lattice constants which is in agreement with experiments .",
    "in contrast to usual bcs superconductors , where the pairing interaction between cooper electrons is mediated by phonons , the superconducting pairing interaction in the cuprates can not be interpreted as an effective interaction of second order in some electron - bath coupling . instead , the main contribution to the pairing results from the part of the exchange interaction which commutes with the hopping hamiltonian @xmath19 .",
    "the superconducting state naturally arises from a typical oscillation behavior of the correlated electrons between neighboring lattice sites due to the presence of spin fluctuations .",
    "the theoretical results can explain the experimental findings in the underdoped as well as in the optimal doping regime .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath0 at optimal doping has the correct order of magnitude .",
