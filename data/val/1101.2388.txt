    "recently , significant interests have been focused on generalizing the classical notion of game theory to an analogous quantum version @xcite , the so - called quantum game theory , which is a new born branch of quantum information theory .",
    "quantum games and quantum strategies can exploit both quantum superposition @xcite and quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "meyer has pointed the way for generalizing the classical game theory to quantum domain by utilizing the quantum superposition @xcite , though it has been argued that the meyer s scheme can be classically realized @xcite . by making use of the entanglement resource",
    ", the prisoner s dilemma has been quantized through the scheme of eisert et al . and shown that the game ceases to pose a dilemma if a restricted quantum strategies are allowed for @xcite , which has been experimentally demonstrated by du et al . @xcite . since then more",
    "work has been done on quantum prisoners dilemma @xcite and a number of other games have been generalized to the quantum realm ( for review , see refs.@xcite and references therein ) . besides those games in which the players have finite number of strategies , the quantization of classical cournot s duopoly in which the players can access to a continuous set of classical strategies has been also investigated @xcite .",
    "classical cournot s duopoly exhibits a dilemma - like situation , in which the unique nash equilibrium is inferior to the pareto optimum . for the quantum version of cournot s duopoly , even though two players both act as `` selfishly '' in the quantum game , they are found to virtually cooperate due to the quantum entanglement between them @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement is usually very fragile against the decoherence caused by the interaction with the surrounding environment .",
    "the advantage of most of the previous quantum games are not robust against the noise @xcite and the unique properties of various quantum games different from their classical counterpart will disappear in the limit of decoherence @xcite .",
    "however , chen et al . have discussed decoherence in quantum prisoners dilemma @xcite , and found some kinds of decoherence have no effects on the nash equilibria in the quantized prisoners dilemma with maximally entangled states . here",
    ", we present the simulation schemes of the quantized symmetric or asymmetric cournot s duopoly , in which there is not any entanglement involved .",
    "however , the players can also escape the dilemma - like situation . in this scheme ,",
    "classical measuring apparatus provides more profits than the quantum measuring apparatus . in the asymmetric game , `` virtual cooperation '' does not give any advantage to the weaker of two firms if the degree of the asymmetry exceeds certain threshold value .",
    "the most significant aspect of this scheme is its symmetric decoherence - free , namely certain kind of symmetric decoherence does not alter the unique property of this quantized cournot s duopoly .",
    "to make this paper self - contained , we briefly outline the classical cournot s duopoly and its quantization version in ref.@xcite . in a simple version of cournot s model for the duopoly",
    ", two firms simultaneously decide the quantities @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively of a homogeneous product released on the market .",
    "suppose @xmath2 is the total quantity , i.e. , @xmath3 , and the market - clearing price is given by @xmath4 for @xmath5 and @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "the unit cost of producing the product is assumed to be @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "the payoffs or profits of the firms can be written as u_i(q_1,q_2)=q_i[p(q)-c]=q_i[k-(q_1+q_2 ) ] , where @xmath10 is a constant and @xmath11 .",
    "solving for the nash equilibrium ( immune to unilateral deviations ) yields the cournot equilibrium , q^_1=q^_2=. at this equilibrium the payoff for the firm @xmath12 ( @xmath11 ) is @xmath13 , which is not the optimal solution .",
    "if two firms can cooperate and restrict their quantities to @xmath14 , they can both get higher payoff @xmath15 , which is the highest profits they can attain in this symmetric game . however , in a competing game , the objective of each firm is to maximize its individual payoff , and avoid the unilateral deviation causing decrease of its profit .",
    "this individual rationality confines the strategies of two firms in the nash equilibrium point .",
    "the quantization version of the classical cournot s duopoly showed that quantum entanglement creates virtual cooperation of two firms and the larger entanglement can guarantee the players ( in the nash equilibrium ) a payoff closer to the highest feasible payoff , i.e. the pareto - optimal payoff .",
    "notwithstanding the domination role of entanglement in various quantum strategies , we attempt to present a simulation scheme of quantized cournot s duopoly , in which there is not any intermediate quantum entanglement involved .",
    "we utilize two single - mode optical fields which are initially in the vacuum state @xmath16 .",
    "then , two optical fields are sent to firm 1 and firm 2 , respectively .",
    "the strategic moves of firm 1 and firm 2 are represented by the displacement operators @xmath17 and @xmath18 locally acted on their individual optical fields .",
    "the players are restricted to choose their strategies from the sets s_i=\\{_i(x_i)=|x_i[0 , ) } ,  i=1,2 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the annihilation and creation operators of the @xmath12th mode optical field , respectively . in this stage",
    ", the state of the game becomes a direct product of two coherent states @xmath21 and @xmath22 , |=|x_1|x_2 .",
    "having executed their moves , firm 1 and firm 2 forward their optical fields to the final measurement , prior to which a beam splitter operation @xmath23 $ ] ( @xmath24 ) is carried out .",
    "therefore the final state prior to the measurement can be expressed as |&=&|_1+ix_2 + & & |_2+ix_1 .",
    "then , a measurement on the photon number of the optical fields is carried out , which is usually done by photon - detector .",
    "the measurement is also one of the key issues in quantum games .",
    "different kinds of measurement schemes can alter the characteristics of the games @xcite .",
    "the measurement schemes mainly depend on the measuring apparatus used . in what follows ,",
    "we analyze two kinds of measuring apparatuses and investigate their influence on this simulation scheme : ( 1 ) `` classical '' measuring apparatus which can only give out the expected values of the photon numbers of the optical fields such as the optical power meter .",
    "( 2 ) quantum measuring apparatus , such as the highly sensitive quantum photon - counter which can measure the photon number and its distribution .",
    "firstly , we assume only the expected values of the photon number of the optical fields are measured by the classical measuring apparatus , and the expected values of the photon number are @xmath25 ( @xmath11 ) , which are regarded as the individual quantities .",
    "hence the payoffs are given by u^q_i(_1,_2)=u_i(n_1,n_2 ) , where the superscript `` q '' denotes `` quantum '' .",
    "the classical cournot s duopoly can be faithfully represented when @xmath26 ( the identity operator ) , in which the quantities of firm 1 and firm 2 is @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . for the final state in eq.(5 ) , the measurement gives the respective quantities of two firms n_1=(x^2_1 ^ 2+x^2_2 ^ 2 ) , + n_2=(x^2_2 ^ 2+x^2_1 ^ 2 ) .",
    "then , the quantum profits for two firms are given by u^q_1(_1,_2)=(x^2_1 ^ 2+x^2_2 ^ 2)[k-(x^2_1+x^2_2 ) ] , + u^q_2(_1,_2)=(x^2_2 ^ 2+x^2_1 ^ 2)[k-(x^2_1+x^2_2 ) ] .",
    "solving for the nash equilibrium gives the unique one x^_1=x^_2=. the profits of two firms at this equilibrium are given by u^q_1=u^q_2=. from eq.(10 ) , we can see that the profit at the equilibrium increases from the classical payoff @xmath29 to pareto - optimal payoff @xmath30 when @xmath31 increases in the range of @xmath24 .",
    "obviously , not any intermediate quantum entanglement has been involved in this scheme .",
    "but this fact does not impede the successful escaping from the dilemma when @xmath32 .",
    "it is true that complete classical system can be used to implement the proposed scheme . for example , by making use of the source of classical light or electromagnetic wave , two modulators , beam splitter , and power meters , one can realize this simulation scheme . though there exists",
    "the intermediate entanglement in the quantization scheme of ref.@xcite , the final state in eq.(11 ) in ref.@xcite is also not entangled . in this sense ,",
    "the present scheme and the one in ref.@xcite can be regarded as the same kind but with different definitions of quantum strategies .      in this subsection",
    ", we assume that a quantum measuring apparatus can be used to measure the photon number distributions of the optical fields .",
    "the measured value of photon number is regarded as the quantity of the respective strategy , then the average payoff is calculated based on the probability distribution of the photon number . for the final state in eq.(5 ) , the payoffs are given by u^q_i(_1,_2)= , where = ^_m_1,m_2=0u_i(m_1,m_2)p_m_1,m_2 denotes the average of @xmath33 taken over all possible values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 with the poisson distribution p_m_1,m_2&=&e^-(x^2_1+x^2_2 ) + & & .",
    "for simplicity , we assume @xmath36 and @xmath8 tend to infinity but keeping @xmath37 a finite constant . in this case , the quantum payoffs for two firms are given by u^q_1(_1,_2)=(x^2_1 ^ 2+x^2_2 ^ 2)[k-1-(x^2_1+x^2_2 ) ] , + u^q_2(_1,_2)=(x^2_2 ^ 2+x^2_1 ^ 2)[k-1-(x^2_1+x^2_2 ) ] .",
    "+ in this case , when @xmath38 ( the identity operator ) , the scheme can not return to the classical cournot s duopoly . comparing the payoffs in eq.(14 ) and eq.(8 ) , we can find that quantum fluctuation causes the reduce of the payoffs .",
    "solving for the nash equilibrium yields the unique one x^_1=x^_2=. the profits of two firms at this equilibrium are given by u^q_1=u^q_2=. from eq.(16 ) , we can see that the profit at the equilibrium increases from the @xmath39 to @xmath40 when @xmath31 increases from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the above results show the scheme using classical measuring apparatus has advantage to the scheme using the quantum measuring apparatus .",
    "here , for avoiding the emergence of the situation @xmath43 with nonzero probability , after eq.(13 ) it has been assumed @xmath36 and @xmath8 tend to infinite but keeping @xmath10 a finite constant , which guarantees the payoff summed over @xmath34 , @xmath35 from @xmath41 to infinity in eq.(12 ) has the analytical expression in eq.(14 ) . for very large but finite value of @xmath36 and @xmath8 , the probability @xmath44 in eq.(13 ) corresponding to @xmath43 tends to very very small , and the summation of those terms with @xmath43 in eq.(12 ) should be written as the summation of @xmath45 or @xmath46 which also tends to small enough to guarantee the payoff well approximated by the eq.(14 ) .",
    "however , for other cases with small values of @xmath36 , the situation becomes very complicate .",
    "the payoff in eq.(14 ) is not valid and need to be revised .",
    "it is very difficult to obtain an analytical result in this situation .",
    "our numerical results show the optimal payoff of two firms is between @xmath15 and @xmath47 as @xmath31 tends to @xmath48 . for examples , in the case with @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the optimal payoff is about @xmath53 , which is near @xmath54 ; in the case with @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the optimal payoff is about @xmath57 .",
    "thus it is conjectured that the conclusion that scheme using classical measuring apparatus has advantage to the scheme using the quantum measuring apparatus is valid even in the cases with small values of @xmath36 and @xmath8 .",
    "the most significant characteristics of our simulation scheme is its symmetric decoherence - free .",
    "previous works have shown that the decoherence could destroy the advantage of quantum game @xcite . in our simulation scheme ,",
    "the advantage of quantum game is robust against the symmetric photon - loss , where the decoherence caused by the photon loss can be described by the following master equation @xcite , = ^2_i=1_i(t)^_i- ( ^_i_i(t)+(t)^_i_i ) , where @xmath58 is the decay rate .",
    "@xmath59 represents the whole state of the firm 1 and firm 2 .",
    "the evolving state can be expressed as , |x_1(t)_1|x_2(t)_2 where @xmath60 ( @xmath11 ) . then forward the evolving state into the beam splitter and we have |(t)&=&|_1e^-t+ix_2e^-t + & & |_2e^-t+ix_1e^-t . from the above quantum state",
    ", we can immediately obtain the following conclusion : if both firms have the complete information about the photon loss , they can adjust their strategies according to the transformation @xmath61 , which can guarantee the final payoffs are invariant under the influence of the photon loss process .",

    "<S> a simulation scheme of quantum version of cournot s duopoly is proposed , in which there is a new nash equilibrium that may be also pareto optimal without any entanglement involved . </S>",
    "<S> the unique property of this simulation scheme is decoherence - free against the symmetric photon loss . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we analyze the effects of the asymmetric information on this simulation scheme and investigate the case of asymmetric game caused by asymmetric photon loss . </S>",
    "<S> a second - order phase transition - like behavior of the average profits of the firm 1 and firm 2 in nash equilibrium can be observed with the change of the degree of asymmetry of the information or the degree of `` virtual cooperation '' . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that asymmetric photon loss in this simulation scheme plays a similar role with the asymmetric entangled states in the quantum game .    </S>",
