    "in recent years interest in obtaining wormhole - type solutions has increased appreciably , primarily because of the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the present universe . at the present time",
    "it is widely believed that such an acceleration is due to the presence of some special form of matter  dark energy  ( de )  @xcite .",
    "one of the key features of the latter is its ability to violate various energy conditions . in the most extreme case , de",
    "is modeled by matter violating the null energy condition , when the effective pressure @xmath0 of matter filling the universe is negative and larger ( modulus ) than its energy density @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 .",
    "such matter is called exotic .    in modeling the accelerated expansion of the universe",
    ", it is usually assumed that de is distributed homogeneously and isotropically on the largest scales .",
    "this , however , does not exclude a possibility that de might cluster on relatively small scales comparable to sizes of galaxies or even of separate stars . in the latter case ,",
    "the literature in the field offers compact objects composed of de ( the so - called dark energy stars ) , which are modeled by some form of matter possessing the properties of de @xcite .",
    "such objects may have both a trivial and a nontrivial topology of spacetime . in the latter case , to construct localized solutions , one needs to invoke some form of exotic matter which permits compact configurations to have a nontrivial ( wormholelike ) topology . in the simplest case",
    "one can employ the so - called ghost ( or phantom ) scalar fields , which may be massless  @xcite or possess a potential energy  @xcite ( other examples of phantom field wormholes can be found , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite , and for a general overview on the subject of lorentzian wormholes , see the book  @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is to consider the case where exotic matter is clustered in the presence of ordinary ( baryonic ) matter .",
    "such mixed compact configurations , with a nontrivial topology provided by using ghost scalar fields , have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in that case",
    ", a wormhole is assumed to be filled by ordinary ( neutron ) matter , and the resulting systems possess properties both of wormholes and of ordinary stars : on the one hand , the topology of spacetime is nontrivial , and on the other hand , there is a visible surface created by a neutron fluid . due to the presence of the nontrivial topology , the physical properties ( masses , sizes , distributions of matter ) of such configurations may differ considerably from those of systems with a trivial topology ( for example , ordinary neutron stars ) .    the possibility to construct objects which acquire new properties in the presence of a nontrivial topology motivates one to study mixed systems supported by other sources of exotic matter . in the simplest case",
    "one can modify the systems of refs .",
    "@xcite `` one scalar field plus ordinary matter '' by adding to them one more scalar field interacting with the first one .",
    "systems with two scalar fields are themselves well known in quantum field theory , where they are used to obtain solitary wave solutions  @xcite . when a gravitational field is present ,",
    "such systems have also been repeatedly considered in the cosmological and astrophysical contexts ( see , for example , in refs .",

    "the presence of a second scalar field allows one to get new interesting solutions , not shared by one - field systems ( for example , the cosmological quintom models containing usual and ghost scalar fields and possessing the properties both of quintessence and of phantom models  @xcite ) .",
    "we will show below that the inclusion in our mixed system of the second field will allow us to obtain configurations that possess new physical properties and differ substantially from one - field systems .",
    "consistent with this , in the present paper we consider mixed astrophysical systems consisting of a wormhole supported by two interacting ghost scalar fields and filled by ordinary matter .",
    "our goal is to clarify the question of how the presence of such a wormhole changes the distribution of the ordinary matter and influences the physical characteristics of the resulting objects .",

    "[ conclusion ] we summarize the results obtained .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , here we study a mixed gravitating system consisting of two interacting ghost scalar fields @xmath3 and a perfect fluid .",
    "the lagrangian for this system can be presented in the form @xmath4+l_m,\\ ] ] with the curvature scalar @xmath5 and newton s constant @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the lagrangian of the perfect isotropic fluid ( where isotropic means that the radial and the tangential pressure of the fluid agree ) , which has the form @xmath8 .",
    "we choose the scalar field potential energy @xmath9 as @xmath10 here @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the masses of the scalar fields , @xmath13 are the coupling constants , and @xmath14 is some constant whose value is chosen from the statement of the problem .",
    "( note that one of these free parameters can always be eliminated by the corresponding rescaling . ) using this potential , we obtained earlier a number of solutions which can be employed both in describing astrophysical objects and when considering cosmological problems .",
    "namely , we have shown that : ( a ) for the four - dimensional case , there exist regular spherically and cylindrically symmetric solutions @xcite , and also cosmological solutions both for usual fields ( i.e. , for the fields having the usual sign in front of the kinetic energy term ) and for ghost scalar fields  @xcite ; ( b ) for the higher - dimensional cases , there exist thick brane solutions supported by usual and ghost scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "an important feature of this potential is the presence of two local minima at @xmath15 to which the solutions tend asymptotically at spatial infinity .",
    "these local minima correspond to two vacua . for wormhole - type systems ,",
    "the solution starts in one of these vacua as @xmath16 and returns to it back as @xmath17  @xcite ( @xmath18 is the spatial coordinate ) .",
    "such solutions are called nontopological  @xcite , in contrast to solitonlike solutions with one scalar field when the solution starts in one of the vacua and goes to the other .",

    "one of the simplest ways to describe star s matter is to employ a polytropic fluid .",

    ", it is seen from the table that while the central value of the neutron fluid density increases , the masses of the scalar fields remain practically unchanged .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that the spatial distribution of the scalar fields changes also very slightly for different amount of the neutron matter . in this sense",
    ", the scalar fields can be regarded as the background ones .",
    "but the total mass of the configuration varies substantially that is obviously caused by a change in the number of neutrons @xmath143 in the system ( see the table ) .",
    "2 .   the presence of the ordinary matter results in the following changes in the geometry of the system : ( a ) as the amount of the neutron matter increases , the redshift function @xmath144 increasingly differs from 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_metric ] ) , i.e. , the system becomes more and more relativistic ; ( b ) at @xmath134 two weakly marked throats are necessarily present in the system ( see in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_metric ] ) , in contrast to systems supported by scalar fields only where just one throat is present .",
    "one more interesting feature associated with the presence of the two scalar fields is a unique shape of the neutron matter distribution along the radius .",
    "the literature in the field offers different systems with an isotropic fluid having a maximum density at the center , like that illustrated by the curve labeled by `` neutron star '' in fig .",
    "[ fig_energ_dens ] .",
    "this applies both to systems with a trivial topology of spacetime ( ordinary stars ) and to the mixed systems of the `` wormhole plus ordinary matter '' type of refs .",
    "when a system contains an anisotropic fluid , its maximum density may already be located somewhere between the center and the edge of the system ( see refs .",
    "@xcite concerning ordinary stars and ref .",
    "@xcite where a mixed system is discussed ) .",
    "for the mixed configurations considered here such a shift of the maximum fluid density takes place even for isotropic matter , and the central density of the neutron matter can vary from 0 to the values of the order of nuclear density ( see the table and fig .  [ fig_energ_dens ] ) .    of course , the obtained quantitative characteristics ( masses , sizes , shapes of the neutron matter distribution ) depend essentially on the specific values of scalar field parameters ( coupling constants , boundary conditions ) and of ordinary matter characteristic densities and sizes .",
    "but one might expect that the qualitative behavior of the solutions will remain the same even with a different , physically reasonable choice of the parameters of the system under consideration .",
    "we have studied equilibrium mixed configurations consisting of a wormhole supported by two interacting ghost scalar fields and threaded by a relativistic polytropic neutron fluid .",
    "the scalar fields play the role of exotic matter providing a nontrivial topology of spacetime in the system .",
    "our goal was to investigate the influence that such a nontrivial topology has on the distribution of the neutron matter and on physical characteristics of resulting objects .",
    "in doing so , we compared the obtained mixed configurations with a neutron star modeled by matter with the same eos .",
    "having fixed the polytropic parameters and coupling constants of the scalar fields , we kept track of changes in the distribution of the neutron matter depending on the central value of the neutron matter rest - mass density .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .   there",
    "exist static regular asymptotically flat solutions describing mixed neutron - star - plus - wormhole systems in which the neutron matter is concentrated in a finite - size region . such configurations may be regarded as consisting of a neutron star having either a single throat at the center ( at zero central density of the neutron matter ) or an equator surrounded by a double throat ( see fig .  [ fig_metric ] ) .",
    "2 .   due to the presence of two scalar fields",
    ", the neutron fluid always has a maximum density somewhere between the center of the configuration and the edge of the fluid . in this case",
    "the central density of the neutron matter can vary from 0 to the values of the order of nuclear density ( see table  [ tab1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig_energ_dens ] ) . such a behavior , which is usually characteristic of anisotropic fluids , is attained here even in the case of isotropic fluid .",
    "this is because of the characteristic behavior of the redshift function @xmath144 which , in systems with two scalar fields , has a minimum shifted away from the center ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_metric ] , and also the pure scalar field systems of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    altogether , as regards the form of the neutron matter distribution , the mixed systems `` two scalar fields plus isotropic matter '' discussed here are similar to the mixed systems `` one scalar field plus anisotropic matter '' of ref .",
    "@xcite , with the main difference related to the behavior of the redshift function . on the other hand ,",
    "the mixed two - field systems considered here differ in principle from the mixed one - field systems of refs .",
    "@xcite , for which the maximum of the neutron fluid density is _ always _ located at the center of a configuration .    in conclusion , we may say a little regarding the question of stability of the considered mixed systems .",
    "the results available in the literature indicate that for pure field configurations ( with no ordinary matter ) wormhole solutions are linearly @xcite and nonlinearly @xcite unstable ( see , however , the recent work @xcite where a method of obtaining general - relativistic stable wormhole solutions is presented ) . as shown in our previous studies of mixed `` wormhole plus star '' systems with one scalar field @xcite , the presence of ordinary matter did not result in stabilization of the configuration .",
    "one might expect that the inclusion in the system of one more ghost scalar field will not change the stability situation .",
    "nevertheless , this issue requires special study , and we plan to perform such a stability analysis later on .",
