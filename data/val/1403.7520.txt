    "the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) is a new instrument for the gemini south telescope . designed and optimized only for high - contrast imaging",
    ", it incorporates advanced adaptive optics , diffraction control , and a near - infrared spectrograph and an imaging polarimeter . during first light scientific observations in november 2013 , gpi achieved contrast performance that is an order of magnitude better than conventional adaptive optics imagers .",
    "irect imaging is a powerful complement to indirect exoplanet detection techniques . in direct imaging",
    ", the planet is spatially resolved from its star , allowing it to be independently studied .",
    "this capability opens up new regions of parameter space , including sensitivity to planets at @xmath7 5 au .",
    "it also allows spectroscopic analysis of the light emitted or reflected by the planet to determine its composition@xcite@xcite and astrometry to determine the full keplerian orbital elements@xcite@xcite .",
    "imaging planets is extremely challenging ",
    "jupiter is @xmath8 times fainter than our sun in reflected visible light .",
    "younger extrasolar planets are more favorable targets . during their formation , planets are heated by the release of gravitational potential energy . depending on the exact formation process and initial conditions , a 4 jupiter - mass ( @xmath9 ) planet at an age of 10 million years could have a luminosity between @xmath10 and @xmath11@xcite  but this is still a formidable contrast ratio . to overcome this",
    ", astronomers have combined large telescopes ( to reduce the impact of diffraction ) , adaptive optics ( to correct for phase errors induced by atmospheric turbulence ) , and sophisticated image processing @xcite@xcite .",
    "this recipe in various combinations had achieved several notable successes @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . however , the rate of these discoveries remains low@xcite@xcite@xcite , in part because the number of suitable young stars in the solar neighborhood is low , and , for all but the closest stars , detection is limited to @xmath12 au where planets may be relatively rare . to move beyond this limited sample ,",
    "dedicated instruments are needed that are designed specifically for high - contrast imaging .",
    "one such instrument is the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) .",
    "gpi is a fully - optimized high contrast ao facility deployed on an 8-m telescope and is almost an order of magnitude more sensitive than the instruments of the previous generation . with this powerful dedicated facility",
    ", large - scale surveys could increase the sample of directly imaged giant planets to 2550 , or more @xcite .",
    "we present an overview of the design of gpi , discuss its initial operation and performance , and show first - light science results .",
    "at high dynamic ranges , the point spread function ( psf ) of a bright star imaged through a telescope is complex @xcite@xcite , with light scattered by a variety of different mechanisms and imperfections interacting coherently and varying on different timescales .",
    "atmospheric turbulence induces large wavefront phase errors ( and smaller intensity fluctuations . )",
    "these are corrected ( imperfectly ) by the adaptive optics ( ao ) system ; the residual phase errors produce a halo of scattered light . instantaneously and monochromatically this halo is broken up into individual speckles . over long exposures , these speckles move randomly and the atmospheric component of the halo reduces to a smooth profile . however , if the measurements of the phase used to control the adaptive optics are biased , the residual phase will have a non - zero mean and the speckle pattern will have persistent components that could be mistaken for a planet . these can be attenuated through psf subtraction @xcite , but often the exact bias will vary as , e.g. , the mean seeing changes , resulting in a halo that changes on timescales of minutes@xcite . an additional source of persistent speckles are intensity variations either due to reflectivity variations or to propagation of wavefront errors on surfaces not conjugate to the deformable mirrors ( dm ) @xcite . even in the absence of wavefront errors , the finite aperture of the telescope causes diffraction that can swamp the planetary signal .",
    "gpi is designed to deal with these errors through multiple approaches .",
    "the ao system has a large number of degrees of freedom and operates at high cadence to minimize residual atmospheric turbulence .",
    "an apodized - pupil lyot coronagraph ( aplc ) @xcite removes residual diffraction .",
    "most importantly and uniquely , the entire design of the optical system is intended to minimize biases in the wavefront measurement and in turn minimize quasi - static speckles .",
    "the instrument was also designed to minimize the chromaticity of the psf  the aplc design sacrifices inner working angle for achromaticity @xcite , the number of transmissive elements is kept to a minimum , individual mirrors are polished to @xmath13  nm root mean square ( rms ) surface error , and optics near focal planes are avoided to reduce chromatic fresnel effects . as a result , the residual speckle pattern is highly correlated between different wavelength channels and can be further attenuated through multi - wavelength post - processing@xcite .",
    "table 1 summarizes the properties of the instrument .",
    "the adaptive optics system is intended to improve on previous facilities in two respects  lower total wavefront error from dynamic sources , and also lower quasi - static errors by an order of magnitude .",
    "typical current ao systems such as the 349-actuator system on the keck telescopes @xcite has @xmath14 250  nm rms of dynamic wavefront error on a bright star @xcite ; gpi is designed to achieve @xmath15  nm .",
    "the static errors of current systems are hard to estimate , but generally are 50 to 100  nm rms . for the keck ao system",
    "this number is 113 nm @xcite ; the design goal for gpi was 10  nm .    to achieve this goal",
    ", gpi adopts several novel features .",
    "the high - order ao system has 43 subapertures across the the gemini south pupil .",
    "a conventional piezoelectric dm with this number of subapertures would have a diameter @xmath16 20 cm , resulting in an instrument too large for the cassegrain focus .",
    "instead , gpi uses a silicon mems dm manufactured by boston micromachines corporation @xcite .",
    "this dm has 64 @xmath17 64 ( 4096 ) actuators  gpi uses a 48-actuator circle ( including slaved actuator rings ) within this area .",
    "this compact ( 25.6-mm diameter ) device enables precision ao correction within a small volume and mass ( 2200 kg ) .",
    "the mems dm has two noteworthy limitations .",
    "first , the total displacement range is @xmath18 4  @xmath19 m , insufficient to fully correct atmospheric turbulence .",
    "gpi therefore also employs a piezoelectric , low - order dm , referred to as a `` woofer . ''",
    "second , the mems dm has five defective actuators inside the controlled pupil .",
    "light from these bad actuators is blocked by the coronagraphic lyot mask .",
    "tip / tilt control is provided jointly by a piezoelectric mount for the whole woofer dm ( @xmath20 30  hz ) and actuation of the woofer surface itself ( @xmath7 30  hz ) .",
    "gpi employs a shack - hartmann wavefront sensor ( aowfs ) .",
    "such sensors are susceptible to aliasing of errors outside the nyquist range , which can inject significant mid - frequency wavefront errors into the final image .",
    "a spatial filter@xcite was installed to mitigate this .",
    "the spatial filter is adjustable with size set by the nyquist criterion .",
    "the spatial filter can also be used for calibration . by adjusting it to a pinhole",
    "we can inject a nearly perfect spherical wavefront into the aowfs , allowing fast calibration of the dominant source of non - common - path aberrations in the system .",
    "gpi uses a computationally efficient fourier transform reconstructor@xcite to translate aowfs slopes into dm commands .",
    "the control loop gain of each fourier mode is individually optimized @xcite to minimize total wavefront error as atmospheric turbulence and star brightness vary .",
    "gpi operates at a cassegrain focus and so is subject to a variable gravity vector . the mechanical structure of gpi is therefore designed to minimize and actively control flexure .",
    "individual components such as the dm and lenslets remain optically registered to each other to within a few microns .",
    "gpi uses an aplc , which suppresses diffraction by using a grey - scale mask to taper the transmission near the edges of the pupil .",
    "the transmission profile of this mask is matched to the fourier transform of the hard - edged focal - plane stop ( radius @xmath21 ) such that residual diffraction is channeled outside the telescope pupil at a lyot stop @xcite .",
    "the masks were implemented with a dithered half - tone pattern of 10 @xmath19 m metal dots on a glass substrate ; the focal - plane stop operates in reflection as a gold - coated mirror with a small central hole .",
    "the machined lyot stops are located inside the cryogenic spectrograph . a grid of narrow , widely - spaced lines printed onto the apodizer forms a two - dimensional grating , producing diffracted images of the central star in a square pattern .",
    "these satellite images ( fig .",
    "1 ) track the star s position and intensity , facilitating astrometric and photometric calibration data@xcite@xcite .",
    "a flexible and automated data pipeline transforms raw data into calibrated datacubes and starlight - subtracted images .",
    "steps in this process include removal of detector systematics , wavelength calibration , compensation for time - variable flexure , assembly into multiwavelength datacubes , astrometric and photometric calibration into physical units , and psf calibration and subtraction .",
    "this open - source software and extensive documentation is freely available .",
    "a near - infrared ( ir ) pointing and low - order wavefront sensor maintains the star in the center of the focal plane mask hole through feedback to the ao system .",
    "gpi also includes a high - accuracy near - ir interferometer integrated with the coronagraph optics to provide time - averaged measurements of the wavefront at the focal plane stop , similar to that used with the p1640 instrument@xcite , though this has not yet been tested on sky .",
    "the science instrument is a near - ir integral field spectrograph ( ifs ) @xcite .",
    "similar to the osiris and p1640 instruments , it samples each spatial location in the focal plane using a lenslet array and disperses each resultant sample using a prism producing @xmath22 individual microspectra .",
    "each spatial pixel corresponds to 0.0143 arc seconds on the sky . in a single exposure , for each location in the field of view the ifs produces a @xmath23 3070 spectrum over one of the standard astronomical bands ( @xmath24 , with @xmath25-band split in two . ) the ifs uses a teledyne hawaii 2rg detector . operating in up - the - ramp sampling mode it has a readout noise of 5 electrons rms .",
    "it is cooled to @xmath18 80 k with a pair of 15 w stirling - cycle cryocoolers .",
    "gpi was extensively characterized at the university of california , santa cruz prior to shipping to chile @xcite . in october 2013",
    "it was attached to the bottom cassegrain port of the gemini south telescope .",
    "after some brief alignment tests , first light occurred on november 12 , 2013 ( ut ) ; the first testing run continued until november 18 , with a second observing run from december 9 to 12 .",
    "the instrument met its initial performance goals .",
    "the ao system locked onto every target attempted , even in seeing with a fried parameter of @xmath26  cm .",
    "the ao loop closed on stars @xmath27 mag .",
    "( gpi operates down to @xmath28 mag . in better seeing . )",
    "gpi can save extensive ao telemetry at the full system frame rate , including dm commands , raw wavefront sensor images and centroids , reconstructed phases , and tip / tilt measurements and commands .",
    "these have been used to generate an error budget ( table 2 ) for typical observations of @xmath29 pictoris ( @xmath30 mag . ) from observations taken on december 11 ( ut ) .",
    "the fried parameter @xmath31 was estimated to be 20  cm from measurements earlier in the night with a differential image motion monitor located outside the gemini dome , corresponding to better - than - average seeing .",
    "most error terms are directly estimated from ao telemetry , following methods used in @xcite .",
    "two error terms are worth further discussion .",
    "the first is a quasi - static offset on the mems dm , consisting primarily of a phase excursion in the outer two rings of subapertures .",
    "although this is the largest quasi - static term in the error budget , it likely has only a small effect on final images , since the aplc transmission for those subapertures is low .",
    "the likely cause is a reconstruction of centroid patterns that do not correspond to a physical wavefront ( such as rotation of the whole centroid pattern ) , and it will be mitigated through software changes . the second is a strong 60  hz vibration .",
    "the stirling cycle cryocoolers on gpi induce vibration at harmonics of 60  hz in the gpi mechanical structure .",
    "internal to gpi , these contribute about 68 mas of rms tip / tilt image motion at 120 and 180  hz , as measured with our artificial star unit . observing actual stars through the telescope ,",
    "we see an additional 10 mas of 60  hz image motion , indicating a component external to gpi is vibrating .",
    "more significantly , there is 100  nm ( time - domain root - sum - squared of the spatial rms ) of low - order wavefront vibration at 60  hz , primarily focus , when the cryocoolers are operating .",
    "this may indicate that the telescope s mirrors , which are very lightweight , are being driven by the gpi vibrations .",
    "we carried out measurements both with the cryocoolers at full power and reduced to @xmath32 power .",
    "modifications to the cryocoolers in january 2014 are expected to significantly reduce the vibration .    with the cryocoolers at full power",
    ", we estimate the rms wavefront error to be 134  nm ; with the cryocoolers at minimum power , the rms wavefront error is 98  nm ( exclusive of tip / tilt ) , corresponding to a strehl ratio of 0.87 at 1.65  @xmath19 m .",
    "although this is very good ao performance , it is not vastly better than other high - order ao systems .",
    "however , gpi significantly exceeds the raw image contrast of such systems  we ascribe the difference to much better control of quasi - static and systematic errors .",
    "here we discuss observations of @xmath29 pic .",
    "this young , nearby ( 19.4  pc ) , a6v star has a bright , edge - on debris disk @xcite and a directly - imaged super - jupiter , @xmath29 pic b , orbiting at @xmath1410 au @xcite .",
    "various asymmetries in disk structure have been discovered @xcite@xcite , including a midplane warp at @xmath1850 au that has been attributed to a possible planetary perturbation @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the planet has been detected by vlt / naco@xcite , gemini / nici @xcite , and the magellan ao system @xcite .",
    "we observed the planet in @xmath0 band ( 1.65  @xmath19 m ) on november 18 ( 2013 ) ut .",
    "we obtained 33 individual 60-second images in coronagraphic mode , with the cryocoolers operated at minimum power .",
    "the planet was immediately visible in a single raw 60-second exposure ( fig . 1 . ) for comparison , a lower signal - to - noise @xmath0-band detection using nici @xcite required 3962  s of exposure and extensive psf subtraction .",
    "a set of 30 images were psf - subtracted using a modified version of the tloci algorithm @xcite . for each data cube wavelength slice , the remaining wavelengths , and the images at the same wavelength acquired at a different time , are used as psf reference images .",
    "a simulated planet having either a flat spectrum similar to l - dwarfs or a ch@xmath33-dominated spectrum similar to t - dwarfs is used to exclude reference images with more than 10% self - overlap of the planet with the image being processed .",
    "the selected reference images are then used to subtract the stellar noise by performing a loci least - squares fit constrained to positive coefficients .",
    "all star - subtracted data cubes are then rotated to put north up and median combined ( fig .",
    "we evaluate the contrast of the final image by calculating the standard deviation of the intensity in concentric annuli about the star .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of contrast for a 30-minute set of gpi data . in 30-minute exposures",
    ", gpi is performing @xmath34 magnitudes better than typical contrast obtained at the keck observatory .",
    "we use these images to constrain the orbit of @xmath29 pic b. most astrometric calibrators are unsuitable for gpi because of the small field of view ( 2.8 arc seconds on a side ) and also because for low - contrast ratio binary stars the secondary will either saturate the science detector or light from the secondary will perturb the wavefront sensor .",
    "therefore , we calibrated the scale and orientation of gpi using other extrasolar planets as references .",
    "we compared the offset between hr 8799c and hr 8799d measured at the w.m .",
    "keck observatory in october 2013 with gpi observations of this system .",
    "the position of @xmath29 pic b is measured from the combined tloci image .",
    "the position of @xmath29 pic b is estimated in each raw 60-s image from the center of the square pattern defined by the four reference - grid spots .",
    "the measured separation of @xmath29 pic b is @xmath35 mas at a position angle of @xmath36 degrees .",
    "we fit the new gpi astrometric measurements presented here together with the compilation of data in @xcite .",
    "we use markov chain techniques described in @xcite .",
    "the adaptive metropolis - hasting sampler used in @xcite has been replaced by an affine invariant sampler@xcite@xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows an ensemble of trajectories computed using orbital elements sampled from the joint posterior distribution .",
    "the results show a good fit with a posterior expectation value of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the gpi data point implies that @xmath29 pic b has recently turned around on its orbit and roughly one half an orbital period has elapsed since the first astrometric measurement in 2003 .",
    "the combination of small measurement errors and the lever arm provided by extended orbital coverage yields the best estimate to date of the semi - major axis . our new measurement places @xmath29 pic b at a semi - major axis of @xmath39  au , with a corresponding period of @xmath40  yr .",
    "beta pic b will remain observable ( @xmath7 0.2 arcseconds ) at least until march 2016 and will likely reappear before october 2019 .",
    "a possible transit of the planet across the star was observed in 1981@xcite .",
    "our estimated orbital inclination is @xmath41 ; transits of @xmath29 pic will occur if the inclination is within 0.05@xmath42 of edge on .",
    "the next opportunity to observe such a transit by @xmath29 pic b is in september through december 2017 ( 68% confidence ) .",
    "the orbit has a small but nonzero eccentricity ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the corresponding range between periaspe and apoapse ( 8.89.4  au ; see table [ tab - percentiles ] ) falls neatly between the 6.4 au and 16 au asteroidal belts@xcite@xcite@xcite and places the inner belt close to the 3:2 commensurability with the orbital period of @xmath29 pic b    our results agree with @xcite@xcite  the chief difference is the improvement in the confidence intervals ( see table [ tab - percentiles ] ) .",
    "distinct peaks are beginning to emerge in the posterior distribution for epoch of periapse and for @xmath44 ( which is significant for identifying the perturber of the in - falling evaporating bodies . )",
    "the 68% confidence interval for @xmath45 drops from @xmath46 to @xmath47 .",
