    "there has been much work on designing sources of polarization - entangled photons that display high visibility quantum interference  @xcite .",
    "sources pumped by continuous - wave ( cw ) lasers have demonstrated essentially perfect polarization visibility  @xcite .",
    "sources pumped by ultrashort pulses , however , suffer from comparatively low visibility . in frequency space ,",
    "the broader spectrum of a pulsed pump allows for the generation of down - converted photons whose color provides distinguishing information about the polarization .",
    "this correlation between polarization and frequency reduces the polarization visibility  @xcite .",
    "spectral filtering can be used to eliminate this distinguishing information , while a thin nonlinear crystal can be used to limit distinguishability _",
    "a priori_. experiments that rely only on filtering or the use of thin nonlinear crystals can attain high visibility , but at lower photon count rates  @xcite . another technique to compensate or correct for distinguishable information is the use of interference  @xcite .",
    "these schemes interfere distinguishable amplitudes by using two crystals  @xcite , combining photons at a beam - splitter  @xcite , or overlapping two passes through the nonlinear crystal  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate a scheme which utilizes the third concept .",
    "the amplitudes to produce a distinguishable ( or non - maximally entangled ) photon pair in each pass are interfered to yield highly entangled states .",
    "recently , it has been demonstrated that reflecting the pump pulse and down - converted photon pair back through the nonlinear crystal stimulates the production of another photon pair in the same mode as the first  @xcite .",
    "this double - pass set - up has generated four - photon states used to demonstrate spin-1 singlet states  @xcite and heralded generation of path - entangled states  @xcite , and additionally to investigate entangled modes of up to 100 photons  @xcite . until now",
    "the properties of the two - photon state produced by the type - ii non - collinear double - pass have not been explored . in this paper",
    "we explain how this double - pass set - up can be used to optimally generate pulsed entangled photon pairs by effectively compensating all distinguishing information . using the double - pass to interfere distinguishable pair amplitudes",
    "we demonstrate @xmath0 visibility quantum interference for 200 femtosecond pulses without the use of narrowband filters , as well as 98.1% visibility with 5 nm bandwidth interference filters .",
    "in addition , this purification scheme allows correlated photons emitted in all directions to be collected as polarization - entangled photons .",
    "we conclude by examining the space - time visibility of the set - up and the effects on multiphoton states .",
    "the quantum interference visibility we refer to is the polarization visibility , and it is a common measure of the quality of a polarization - entangled state . in the frame of the lab the nonlinear crystal always produces horizontally and vertically polarized photons , thus the visibility in this basis ( hv ) is high regardless of entanglement . by measuring the correlations in the plus and minus 45 degree linear ( pm ) and right and",
    "left circular ( rl ) polarization bases the quantum entanglement of the state can be determined . the polarization visibility , as defined here , is @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the number of coincidence counts measured between spatial modes @xmath3 and",
    "@xmath4 having polarizations @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , which correspond to hv , pm , or rl depending on the measurement basis . it should be noted that @xmath7 .",
    "so , for example , the @xmath8 bell state has @xmath9 in the hv basis and the @xmath10 bell state has @xmath11 in all bases .    before describing our specific experiment",
    "we should first explain what needs to be compensated or filtered to create maximally - entangled polarization states .",
    "in general we would like to be able to factorize the polarization from the other degrees of freedom ( such as k - vector and frequency ) . when that is possible , gaining information about these observables will not provide any polarization information .",
    "this is not generally the case for photon pairs emitted from a type - ii source .",
    "due to birefringence there is a temporal delay between the photons in each mode , and the extraordinary mode walks - off through the crystal along the optical axis .",
    "these temporal and spatial walk - offs can be effectively eliminated by using compensating crystals as in ref .",
    "a new problem arises when the crystal is pumped by a broadband laser : the dispersion and phase - matching conditions in the nonlinear crystal create differences in the ordinary and extraordinary spectral modes  @xcite . in the case of @xmath12 - barium borate ( bbo )",
    "the spectrum of the ordinary photons is wider than that of the extraordinary photons .",
    "this disparity increases for increasing pump bandwidth . when using type - ii non - collinear pdc sources both spatial modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( defined by the intersection of the well - known rings  @xcite ) receive both extraordinary and ordinary photons .",
    "thus , in principle , the polarization of the photon in each mode can be determined solely by knowledge of its frequency . in the following we concentrate on spectral mode dististinguishablity . as mentioned above",
    ", the spectra of the down - converted photons can be made indistinguishable by filtering tightly , however this causes the photon count rates to decrease as well . following a calculation by grice and walmsley  @xcite",
    ", the polarization visibility and coincidence count rate can be obtained as functions of the filter bandwidth .",
    "figure  [ fig : filtergraph ] shows these functions for typical crystal and pump laser parameters in our experiments .",
    "the visibility without filters is 62.2% , but this can be improved to 90.8% by using 5 nm bandwidth filters centered at 780 nm . if one would like to obtain 95% visibility , then the count rate will be half of the unfiltered rate ( assuming filters with ideal peak transmission ) .",
    "another technique to eliminate the spectral mismatch is the use of a thin nonlinear crystal to increase phase - matching ( e.g. , length @xmath13 0.5 mm for our experimental parameters ) .",
    "this results in both extraordinary and ordinary photons having identical , broad spectra ( fwhm @xmath14 15 nm ) .",
    "the use of a thin crystal ( 100 @xmath15 m ) has been demonstrated to give high visibility fringes ( @xmath16 98% ) , however the resulting coincidence count rates were below 100 hz  @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments have attained much higher count rates using a thin crystal pumped by a cw laser  @xcite .     max . ]",
    "a number of experiments have utilized interference in order to compensate pdc  @xcite .",
    "the first proposal for such a technique was by kwiat , _ et al . _ who suggested using a half - waveplate and polarizing beam - splitter ( pbs ) to combine the output of two type - ii collinearly phase - matched down - converters  @xcite .",
    "this technique , combining photons at a pbs , is the one of three general types of interference compensation schemes .",
    "the others are overlapping the emission amplitudes of two nonlinear crystals and reflecting the down - converted photons and pump back through the nonlinear crystal .",
    "the first two techniques have proven quite effective by demonstrating visibility between 90 - 92% for ultrashort pulses without the use of spectral filters  @xcite .",
    "the pulsed , double - pass schemes reported  @xcite also increase visibility to 64% and 80% , respectively , without filtering .",
    "specific comparisons become difficult due to the various types of measurements performed and the different experimental conditions ( e.g. , phase - matching , pump pulse length , crystal length ) . the double - pass scheme presented here provides high visibility for unfiltered pulses without the need to post - select , while using the same set - up that has reliably produced multiphoton entangled states  @xcite . in the following section we discuss the theory behind the double - pass compensation scheme employed in our experiment .",
    "to explain how the double - pass scheme interferes distinguishable amplitudes to produce a higher visibility state we present a simplified version of the detailed theory for pdc .",
    "typically one begins with the effective interaction hamiltonian for type - ii non - collinear single - pass pdc @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the joint spectral amplitude function  @xcite .",
    "the interaction parameter , @xmath19 , depends on the pump intensity , the crystal s @xmath20 nonlinearity , and the crystal length .",
    "this detailed approach can be somewhat cumbersome , and a simpler technique is to ignore frequency correlations between photons .",
    "the frequency correlations do not affect the two - photon visibility , however they do become important when using more than one photon pair  @xcite . ignoring frequency correlations",
    "means that @xmath21 , and the frequency integrals above can be evaluated separately resulting in @xmath22 the prime indicates that the ordinary photons are emitted into a different spectral mode than the extraordinary photons .",
    "the prime mode can be decomposed as @xmath23 where modes 1 and 2 are orthogonal ( @xmath24=0 $ ] ) .",
    "this characterizes the partial overlap between the ordinary and extraordinary spectral modes parameterized by the value of @xmath25 ( the only parameter of this simplified model ) . for the remainder of the paper",
    "we take `` ordinary '' and `` extraordinary '' to label _",
    "spectral modes _ rather than polarization modes .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be written @xmath26 + h.c . \\label{eq:1pass}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the visibility of the photon pairs generated from such a hamiltonian will be perfect ( v=1 ) in the hv basis . in the pm and rl polarization bases , however , the visibility will be limited to @xmath27 .",
    "the second term does not contribute to the visibility because the terms @xmath28 and @xmath29 will not interfere when measured in the pm or rl basis . although the value of @xmath25 can only be predicted by the more detailed theory , eq .",
    "( [ eq:1pass ] ) conveniently explains the features of the double - pass as described below .",
    "the effect of the double - pass is to add another set of modes , 3 and 4 .",
    "these are analogs to 1 and 2 , distinguished only by their time of arrival at the detectors .",
    "the polarization of the down - converted photons from the first pass is flipped ( h@xmath30v ) before they are reflected back into the crystal ( fig .",

    "the change in polarization labels on the first pass can alternatively be viewed as an exchange of the spectral - mode labels ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "when @xmath33 is much less than the coherence time of the down - converted photons , modes 1 and 3 are equivalent , and modes 2 and 4 are equivalent .",

    "the first pass provides ordinary v - polarized photons and extraordinary h photons , while the second pass creates ordinary h and extraordinary v photons . when both passes are combined , knowing the spectral mode no longer provides any polarization information .",
    "this is equivalent to symmetrizing @xmath18 with respect to interchanging its arguments  @xcite . through this technique",
    "we optimally compensate the spectral mismatch of pulsed pdc .",
    "notice that the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq:2passbzero ] ) can be stimulated ( or suppressed ) as a function of the phase ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the other terms have a constant amplitude since the phase appears inside these terms . when the phase is equal to zero , the state produced by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2passbzero ] ) is a superposition of three @xmath10 bell states , each with visibility equal to one .",
    "even from this simple , two - mode model it becomes evident that this technique only works perfectly on two - photon , pdc events  @xcite .",
    "multiphoton events ( @xmath38 ) result from the higher - order terms of the interaction hamiltonian .",

    "( [ eq:2passbzero ] ) is squared only the terms that square with themselves remain maximally entangled ; the cross terms are multimode in the spectral mode space .",

    "this , however , has a smaller effect on the visibility than mode distinguishability at the pump powers used in our experiment . for small values of @xmath19",
    "the contribution from four - photon events is the dominant noise term , and the visibility decreases linearly .",
    "the visibility data presented in this paper depicts this trend showing a typical 4 - 8% visibility decrease as the pump power is increased by a factor of order 100 .",
    "the spectral compensation was tested experimentally by comparing the visibility of the individual passes to that of the double - pass with and without narrowband filters .",

    "when using narrowband filters the spectral modes are governed by the convolution of the ordinary and extraordinary spectral profiles with those of the filters , and are therefore almost indistinguishable , ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the visibility of the double - pass with 5 nm filters as a function of the coincidence count rate is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intfilters ] .",
    "the count rate was decreased by rotating the pump polarization in steps , which reduced the pump power along the optical axis of the crystal .",
    "a maximum visibility of @xmath46 in the pm basis is considerably higher than the 91% predicted and measured for a single - pass .",
    "the count rate at this point is 519 hz . the double - pass also allows high count rates and visibility simultaneously by displaying over 50000 coincidences per second with 95% visibility .",
    "this corresponds to over five million entangled photon pairs per second produced by the crystal when our 10% collection efficiency is considered .",
    "when only edgepass filters are used to eliminate residual uv light from the pump beam , the ordinary and extraordinary spectra differ and the value of @xmath25 is small ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this can be seen in the rl visibility of the individual passes in fig .",

    "all conjugate points of the type - ii rings can be collected as sources of polarization - entangled photons , rather than just the intersection of the rings .",
    "this allows for an increase in photon flux while preserving high visibility ( for instance , with the use of multimode collection ) .    to verify this",
    "experimentally , the count rates of the individual passes were aligned to two different @xmath51 values : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the average single - pass visibilities at these points were 47.9% and 23.5% , respectively , with 5 nm interference filters .",

    "coincidence count rates were over 5000 hz for both measurements .",
    "these high visibilities indicate that substantial polarization entanglement exists for any photons with correlated k - vectors emitted from the crystal .",
    "so far we have restricted our definition of visibility to polarization visibility , obtained by comparing the signal of terms consistent with the state desired to noise from unwanted terms .",
    "another type of measurement that can be done with the double - pass is the space - time , or path visibility .",
    "this is the visibility of the fringes obtained when the pump mirror is translated along the axis of the pump beam .",

    "all of the terms that contribute to the pm ( rl ) coincidences have a phase - dependent amplitude : ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "therefore , the pm ( rl ) count rate is zero at @xmath60 ( for odd integer @xmath43 ) regardless of @xmath25 , and the pm ( rl ) space - time visibility is one .",

    "the hv fringe visibility is 91.3% with 5 nm filters compared to 48.2% with only edgepass . in contrast , the rl inteference fringes ( fig .",

    "while the double - pass scheme has many advantages , a serious challenge is the required interferometric stability . unlike four - photon experiments with the double - pass  @xcite ,",
    "the phase does not just modulate the intensity of the state , but also the phase within some terms ( see eq .",
