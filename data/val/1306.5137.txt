    "the ads / cft correspondence@xcite-@xcite has proven to be useful in describing several aspects of strongly coupled field theories from their weakly coupled dual gravity theories which lie in one higher dimension . over the past several years",
    "this correspondence has been extensively used to explore certain field theoretic phenomena where conventional perturbation methods fail to give consistent results@xcite .    among many sectors",
    "where this correspondence has been applied successfully , strongly interacting condensed matter theory has been central to the discussion where conventional perturbation techniques appear to be unfaithful . using this holographic conjecture",
    "a holographic model of high @xmath2 superconductors has been proposed@xcite-@xcite .",
    "further study of these phenomenological models reveal many of their interesting features which resemble that of the conventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "gravity theories in higher dimensions ( greater than four ) have earned repeated attentions in the past several decades with the advent of string theory .",
    "the primary motivation comes from the fact that the consistent description of string theory requires the inclusion of higher dimensional space - time .",
    "certain aspects of string theory are well described by associating gravity theories with it .",
    "the effect of string theory on gravity may be studied by considering a low - energy effective action which describes classical gravity@xcite .",
    "this effective action must contain higher curvature terms and are needed to be ghost free@xcite .",
    "the lovelock action is found to be consistent with these criteria@xcite .",
    "along with the conventional maxwell electrodynamic theory non - linear electrodynamic theories ( ned ) , which correspond to the higher derivative corrections to the abelian gauge fields , have also become interesting topics of research for the past several decades .",
    "the primary motivation for introducing non - linear electrodynamic theory was to remove divergences in the self - energy of point - like charged particles@xcite .",
    "however , they have earned renewed attention over past several years since these theories naturally arise in the low - energy limit of the heterotic string theory@xcite-@xcite .    besides the conventional born - infeld non - linear electrodynamics ( bine)@xcite , two new types of neds have been proposed recently , namely the exponential non - linear electrodynamics ( ene ) and the logarithmic non - linear electrodynamics ( lne ) , in the context of static charged asymptotic black holes@xcite .",
    "in fact , the matter actions with ene and lne yield the higher derivative corrections to the usual maxwell action .",
    "on the other hand these neds possess many unique properties which are quite different from the maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "for example , while solutions with lne completely remove divergences in the electric fields at @xmath3 , these divergences still remain in the solutions with ene . but these divergences are much weaker than the usual maxwell case@xcite .",
    "also , compared with maxwell theory , solutions with lne and ene have different temperatures and electric potentials@xcite .",
    "another novel property of these non - linear theories is that , their asymptotic black hole solutions are the same as that of a reissner - nordstrm black hole@xcite . on top of that , these types of non - linear theories retain some interesting properties ( alike bine ) such as , absence of shock waves , birefringence etc.@xcite",
    ". one further advantage of studying ene and lne over the maxwell theory is that they provide an enriched platform to investigate generalized versions of neds in a systematic manner so as to reveal some general features of the effects of higher derivative corrections to the gauge fields in the theory concerned .    at this point of discussion",
    "it must be stressed that while gravity theories with neds give rise to many interesting gravity solutions which in many respects are different from the solutions with usual maxwell electrodynamics@xcite-@xcite , these are also widely discussed in the context of gauge / string duality , specifically in the holographic study of condensed matter phenomena with holographic superconductors as specific examples .",
    "holographic superconductors with non - linear electrodynamics@xcite-@xcite have been investigated alongside those with maxwell electrodynamics@xcite .",
    "these studies show that the non - linearity in the theory indeed modifies the behaviors of the holographic condensates in non - trivial manners which can not be observed in the conventional holographic superconductors with maxwell electrodynamics .",
    "in other words the higher derivative corrections to the abelian gauge fields are manifested as effects on certain properties of the dual holographic models .",
    "this observation motivates us to study models of holographic superconductors with ene and lne and look for the modifications they make on certain properties of the models compared to the maxwell case .",
    "this also encourages us to make a comparative study between holographic models with different neds regarding their effects on the condensation formation . in this regard consideration of holographic models with ene and lne",
    "is another motivation of the present paper .",
    "along with the study of holographic superconductors in the framework of conventional einstein gravity several attempts have been made in order to study these objects in the presence of higher curvature corrections to the einstein gravity in higher dimensions@xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these curvature corrections also modify some of the properties of the holographic superconductors , such as @xmath4 the observed constancy of the ratio of the frequency gap of the real part of the conductivity to the critical temperature of the superconductor@xcite breaks down for gauss - bonnet superconductors@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xmath5 in certain generalized cases of different values of the gauss - bonnet correction changes the order of the phase transition@xcite , @xmath6 the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density ( @xmath7 ) in cft dual to the einstein - gauss - bonnet gravity changes significantly with the gauss - bonnet coupling@xcite .    apart from these , the effects of external magnetic fields on the holographic superconductors with or without these nontrivial non - linear corrections have been studied .",
    "these studies reveal several interesting properties of these superconductors which resemble certain properties of conventional superconductors , such as the meissner effect , vortex and droplet solutions etc.@xcite ,  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that holographic superconductors with several neds ( bine , ene , lne ) has been studied in ref.@xcite in the planar schwarzschild - ads black hole background without taking into account higher curvature corrections to the einstein gravity . also , in ref.@xcite a holographic model with bine in the gauss - bonnett gravity has been considered .",
    "surprisingly most of the computations have been performed using numerical methods .",
    "therefore , it would be nice to perform analytic analysis of holographic superconductor models with non - linear electrodynamic fields ( ene and lne ) in the gauss - bonnett black hole background .",
    "considering all the above mentioned facts , in this paper we have made an extensive analytic investigation of the holographic model of superconductors mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "the primary motivations of our study may be summarized as follows : ( i ) investigating the effects of higher curvature as well as higher derivative corrections on the properties of holographic superconductors , ( ii ) exploring the effects of an external magnetic field on the holographic condensates and determining how the non - linear corrections modify the critical value of the magnetic field , ( iii ) making a comparison between the maxwell theory and the non - linear electrodynamic theories regarding their effects on the formation of the scalar condensates , ( iv ) comparing the non - linear electrodynamic theories in an attempt to see which one has stronger effects on the formation of the scalar condensates .",
    "the present paper has been organized as follows . in section 2 , the basic setup for @xmath0-wave holographic superconductor with two different non - linear electrodynamics ( ene and lne ) in the planar @xmath1-dimensional gauss - bonnet ads black hole background is given . in section 3 ,",
    "we have calculated various properties of the @xmath0-wave holographic superconductor with exponential electrodynamics ( ene ) which include the critical temperatures for condensation and the expectation values of the condensation operator in the absence of external magnetic field . in section 4 , we have discussed the effects of an external static magnetic field on this holographic superconductor and calculated the critical magnetic field for condensation .",
    "we have drawn our conclusions and discussed some of the future scopes in section 5 .",
    "finally , in appendix a we have given the expressions of the aforementioned quantities for the @xmath0-wave holographic superconductor with logarithmic electrodynamics ( lne ) and derived a necessary mathematical relation .",

    "but , before that we would like to make some comments on the results obtained so far . these may be put as follows :    \\(i ) from ( and ) it is evident that in order to have a meaningful notion of the critical temperature , @xmath2 , there must have an upper bound to the non - linear coupling parameter , @xmath73 .",
    "the upper bounds corresponding to two non - linear theories are given below : @xmath114    note that , with our choice @xmath78 and for fixed values of @xmath27 , this upper bound is smaller for ene compared to lne .",

    "this feature is general for the two types of holographic superconductors considered in this paper .",
    "it must be remarked that , without any non - linear corrections ( @xmath79 ) the critical temperature is larger than the above two cases .",
    "for example , @xmath115 for @xmath116 , @xmath78 .",
    "this suggests the onset of a harder condensation .",
    "another nontrivial and perhaps the most interesting feature of our present analysis is that , for a particular value of the non - linear parameter , @xmath73 , the value of the critical temperature , @xmath2 , for the holographic condensate with ene is smaller than that with lne ( table:[tab:1 ] ) showing stronger effects of the former on the condensation .",
    "it is also noteworthy that similar feature was obtained numerically by the authors of @xcite in the planar schwarzschild - ads black hole background .",
    "\\(iii ) the condensation gap for the holographic condensate with non - linear electrodynamics is more than that with maxwell electrodynamics ( figure:[fig:1 ] ) . on top of that ,",
    "holographic superconductors with ene exhibit larger gap compared with that with lne .",
    "this suggests that the formation of the scalar hair is more difficult for the holographic condensate with ene@xcite .",

    "in this paper , considering the probe limit , we have studied a holographic model of superconductor in the higher curvature planar gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background .",

    "in addition to that , we have made an analytic investigation on the effects of an external magnetic field on these superconductors .",
    "the primary motivations of the present paper is to study the effects of several non - linear corrections to the gravity and matter sectors of the action ( that describes the holographic superconductivity ) on the holographic @xmath0-wave condensates both in presence as well as absence of an external magnetic field . along with this",
    "we aim to make a comparative study among the usual maxwell electrodynamics and the two neds considered in the paper ( ene , lne ) regarding their effects on the formation of holographic condensates . based on purely analytic methods",

    "the normalized order parameter ( @xmath168 ) increases with the increase of @xmath73 and @xmath27 ( figure:[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "this implies that , in the presence of the higher order corrections the formation of the scalar hairs become difficult .",
    "* the variation of the order parameter with temperature , @xmath119 , exhibits a mean - field behavior . also , the value of the associated critical exponent is @xmath120 , which further ensures that the holographic condensates indeed undergo a second order phase transition in going from normal to superconducting phase .",
    "* there exists a critical magnetic field @xmath122 above which the superconductivity ceases to exist ( figure:[fig:3 ] ) .",
    "this property is similar to that of ordinary type ii superconductors@xcite .",
    "also , the critical magnetic field strength ( @xmath122 ) increases as we increase both @xmath73 and @xmath27 .",
    "the increasing magnetic field strength tries to reduce the condensate away completely making the condensation difficult to form .",
    "* from figures:[fig:1],[fig:3 ] and table:[tab:1 ] we further observe that for particular parameter values @xmath2 is less in holographic superconductor with ene than that with lne whereas , @xmath168 and @xmath122 is more in the previous one .",

    "it is interesting to note that similar conclusions were drawn in ref.@xcite where numerical computations were performed in this direction .",
    "our analytic calculations provide further confirmations regarding this issue .",
    "however , the novel feature of our present analysis is that we have been able to study the effect of the higher curvature corrections which was not performed explicitly in ref.@xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper we have studied the onset of holographic @xmath0-wave condensate in the @xmath1 dimensional planar gauss - bonnet - ads black hole background with several non - linear corrections to the gauge field . in the probe limit , performing explicit analytic computations , with and without magnetic field , we found that these higher order corrections indeed affect various quantities characterising the holographic superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> also , performing a comparative study of the two non - linear electrodynamics it has been shown that the exponential electrodynamics has stronger effects on the formation of the scalar hair . </S>",
