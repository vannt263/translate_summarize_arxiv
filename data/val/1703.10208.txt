    "a variety of phenomena in physics and chemistry involving deposition of large particles , such as colloids and proteins from a solution onto solid substrates , has long been investigated in terms of random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) models @xcite . in those processes , hard - core extended objects made of @xmath1-adjacent monomers arranged in a specified shape ,",
    "drop onto a corresponding group of @xmath1-vacant sites randomly selected from a lattice substrate .",
    "once a @xmath1-mer is accommodated it effectively blocks the available substrate area of all subsequent placements , so a limitting or jamming coverage rapidly emerges @xcite .",
    "however , recent experimental studies suggest that the actual roughness of the substrate may cause the detachment of a fraction of deposited colloids @xcite . in turn , other investigations evidence that detachment also plays a role in the kinetics of polymer chains at solid surfaces @xcite , as well as in deposition of protein particles on dna substrate molecules @xcite . as a result , under small detachment rates the late kinetic stages of such processes are dominated by rearrangements of small empty areas into larger ones which , unlike ordinary rsa , can accommodate more particles and reach denser monolayer deposits @xcite .    following the thread of ideas initiated in refs.@xcite , here",
    "we further consider one - dimensional ( 1d ) adsorption - desorption ( ad ) processes in which the detached @xmath1-mers do not necessarily correspond to the original deposited ones .",
    "in contrast to other relaxational models @xcite these processes contain no explicit monomer diffusion , but it is worth noting that the reconstruction of @xmath1-mers allows for an effective movement of these former , such as occurring e.g. in the ad sequence @xmath5 , say with dimers .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath2 these simple rules amount to a number of conservation laws that grows exponentially with the substrate size . at the root of this",
    "rather unusual partitioning of the phase space is a nonlocal construction , namely , the irreducible string introduced by barma and dhar in ref.@xcite , and which we will briefly discuss in sec.ii .",
    "thereupon , the question is whether the inclusion of interactions between adsorbates ( fairly common in physisorbed species and self - assembly of nanoparticles @xcite ) , would affect the low - temperature dynamics at large time when subject to these nonlocal conservations .    representing , as usual , monomers and vacancies respectively in terms of up and down ising variables , in what follows",
    "we shall think of this problem as a @xmath1-spin flip dynamics of an ising chain with either ferro- or antiferromagnetic nearest - neighbor couplings . in the presence of detailed balance @xcite , which we will assume throughout ,",
    "such multi - spin processes may also be regarded as extensions of both glauber ( @xmath6 ) and kawasaki dynamics ( @xmath7 ) @xcite .",
    "note that in the dimer case these ad processes can be readily reduced to a spin exchange kinetics , though with opposite coupling signs @xcite .",
    "thus , we shall focus on the situation @xmath2 where the dynamics decomposes into many invariable sectors @xcite . to ease the analysis",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to the so called null string sector @xcite , on the other hand the most common in the context of ad processes as it contains the initially empty substrate ( cf .",
    "sec.ii ) .    as is known , in nearing the low - temperature limit the phase ordering dynamics of these 1d processes become critical , being characterized by large relaxation times @xmath8 that grow with the equilibrium correlation length as @xmath9 @xcite . here",
    ", the dynamic exponent @xmath10 defines the universality class to which the dynamics belongs , and at late stages it basically describes how fast the length scale of the ordered phase is spreading after a quench from high temperatures @xcite . in a finite system of typical length @xmath11 , it is customary in practice to think of that scaling relation as a finite - size one , i.e. @xmath12 , provided that @xmath13 becomes comparable to the system size and this is taken sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "thus , in the following sections we shall exploit that finite - size approach to provide an estimation of dynamic exponents in the above reconstituting and interacting @xmath1-mer models .",
    "first , we will recast the master equation @xcite governing those markov processes in terms of a quantum spin representation of their associated liouvillians or evolution matrices @xcite .",
    "these latter lend themselves more readily to a finite - size scaling analysis of actual relaxation times as these are embodied in spectral gaps which we will subsequently evaluate by exact diagonalizations @xcite . also , for ferromagnetic ( f ) couplings we will complement those analyses with simulated quenches down to @xmath4 .",
    "however , when it comes to antiferromagnetic ( af ) interactions this dynamics involves the passage through metastable states ( see sec.iii ) , whose activation energy barriers ( @xmath14 ) make the nonequilibrium simulations difficult to implement at low - temperature regimes . note that in that latter case , and regardless of the system being finite or not , the relaxation time scales can grow arbitrarily large owing to the contribution of arrhenius factors @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thereby when considering exact diagonalizations for the af case , it will be appropriate to put forward a normalized version of the above finite - size scaling hypothesis , namely -0.35 cm @xmath16 so as to ensure that @xmath17 is actually scaled within the arrhenius regime .",
    "in fact , already in approaching that limit with our lowest accessible temperatures , a clear saturation trend of @xmath18 will be obtained for all sizes within reach .",
    "also , and further to the case of af interactions , it is worth anticipating here that for @xmath2 a nontrivial and highly degenerate phase ( rather than a plain af state ) , will arise from the interplay between those couplings and the nonlocal conservations referred to above @xcite .",
    "the layout of this work is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "first we outline the basic transition probability rates of these processes along with their conservation laws which , irrespective of the presence of interactions and so long as all rates are kept nonzero , coincide with those of ref.@xcite . then we exploit detailed balance to bring the evolution operator into a symmetric representation , thus simplifying the numerical analysis of sec.iii . in this latter",
    ", a sequence of finite - size estimates of dynamic exponents for @xmath19 and 4 is obtained from the spectrum gaps of the associated quantum spin hamiltonians. using standard recursive techniques @xcite , these are diagonalized within the subspaces of initially empty chains either with f or af interactions .",
    "in addition , in the f case the scaling regimes of two - point correlations are examined for several values of @xmath1 after a quench from high temperatures . in the af situation ,",
    "statistical aspects of the exponentially degenerate ground state are also addressed .",
    "we close with sec.iv which contains a summarizing discussion of results along with brief remarks on open issues and possible extensions of this work .",
    "the dynamics considered is set on a 1d lattice gas of @xmath11 sites each of which may be singly occupied ( occupation numbers @xmath20 ) , or empty ( @xmath21 ) . as usual in this context , the constituent particles ( monomers ) and vacancies are represented by the states of ising spins @xmath22 defining configurations @xmath23 of energies @xmath24 . to account for either attractive or repulsive interactions between monomers , the coupling constant",
    "is set respectively as f or af .",
    "to ease the subsequent discussion , henceforth we will assume that @xmath25 and that periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) are imposed throughout .",
    "although ising models have no intrinsic dynamics , a markovian one can be prescribed with specific transition probability rates @xcite",
    ". these are thought of as stemming from energy fluctuations when the system is coupled to a heath bath at temperature @xmath26 . for instantaneous quenches of this latter , the transition rates per unit time @xmath27 between two configurations @xmath28 ( here differing in the state of @xmath1-consecutive parallel spins )",

    ", the first excitation mode of @xmath29 singles out the relaxation time of any observable as @xmath34 , whereas by construction [ eqs.([ndiag ] ) , ( [ diag ] ) ] , the steady distribution merely corresponds to a ground state with eigenvalue @xmath35 .    with respect to transition rates ,",
    "these are set to satisfy the detailed balance condition @xcite @xmath36 so as to enforce the system to relax towards the boltzmann distribution @xmath37 at large times .",
    "( in turn , detailed balance also allows for a symmetric representation of the evolution operator ; see sec.iib ) . from now on temperatures are measured in energy units , or , equivalently , the boltzmann constant in @xmath38 is taken equal to unity . on the other hand , evidently there are many choices of @xmath39 that comply with eq.([db ] ) . as usual in the context of kinetic ising models @xcite , here we choose the suzuki - kubo form @xcite @xmath40\\,\\big\\}\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath41 just setting the time scale of the microscopic process and hereafter set to 1 . in the specific case of the @xmath1-spin flip rates involved in the ad processes referred to in sec.i",

    "these are depicted in fig.[processes ] and later on will serve as a basis for the kink construction of sec.iib .",
    "-0.1 cm    -mers ( within brackets ) , and their transition rates as defined in eq.([rates ] )",
    ". filled and empty circles denote spins with opposite orientations in turn forming kinks ( vertical lines ) on the dual chain . these former involve ( a ) pairing processes with rates @xmath42 , as well as ( b ) hopping events with no energy changes.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=56.0% ] -0.25 cm    as stressed before in sec.i",
    ", all @xmath1-spin flips can take place whether or not their locations were previously flipped together , so the identity of desorbed @xmath1-mers is not necessarily preserved but is rather often reconstructed .",
    "now , depending on the spin states neighboring the interval @xmath43 $ ] where these processes may eventually occur , and with the aid of the magnetization @xmath44 associated to that region , the corresponding @xmath45 rates derived from eq.([choice ] ) can then be expressed as @xmath46 \\\\ \\nonumber & = & \\begin{cases } \\,r_{\\!_\\pm } = \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\,1 \\pm \\tanh 2k\\,)\\,,\\;\\;{\\rm for}\\;\\;\\delta e = \\mp 4 j\\ , , \\vspace{0.1 cm }",

    "however , at least at the level of relaxation times ( spectral gaps of @xmath29 ) , let us anticipate that in the low - temperature limit all @xmath17 s become numerically indistinguishable as long as @xmath49 is kept constant and f interactions are considered ( see sec.iiia ) .",
    "when it comes to conservation laws , since @xmath25 the lattice @xmath50 is @xmath1-partite in 1d ( i.e. @xmath51 ) , and so a set of independent constants of motion can be readily identified @xcite . since at every deposition ( evaporation ) step the number of incoming ( outgoing ) monomers is the same on each sublattice , then clearly their magnetization differences @xmath52 will be maintained throughout the process . from these @xmath53 differences ,",
    "only @xmath54 of them are independent , so the number of conservation laws would grow at most as @xmath55 .",
    "however , as mentioned in sec.i , for @xmath56 there is in fact a much more exhaustive set of constants of motion , in turn growing _ exponentially _ with the system size .      to understand that latter issue , following",
    "ref.@xcite we now define the irreducible string ( is ) @xmath57 of a given spin configuration as the sequence obtained by deleting all groups of @xmath1 consecutive parallel spins appearing on chosen locations , and then repeating recursively the procedure on the resulting shorter string ( @xmath58 ) until no further such groups remain . as an illustration , consider the following examples , say for @xmath59 , @xmath60 in the first case , this deletion ( marked by boxes ) is applied to a group of spins chosen starting from either the left or right , the actual location of the targeted group being irrelevant . in the second instance",
    "the procedure is carried out recursively in two steps and no characters are left .",
    "in the third example the string considered is already jammed and can not evolve further .",
    "the invariance of the irreducible characters ( if any ) left by this process is in line with the idea that successive ad attempts on a given spin configuration just changes the position of those characters by multiples of @xmath1 lattice spacings .",
    "the separations between them are mediated by substrings of different lengths @xmath58 , though all of these are in turn reducible to null strings ( * ns * ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the ad dynamics may be thought of as a random walk of hard - core irreducible characters ( they can not cross each other ) , as depicted schematically in fig.[walk ] .",
    "the positions of these walkers at a given instant of course depend on the order in which the reduction rule is applied , but the issue to bear in mind here is that the order in the sequence of irreducible characters remains unaltered throughout .    -0.05 cm   and @xmath61 with pbc s . the deletion procedure described in the text",
    "is here depicted by the boxes around reducible groups of spins . at each step",
    "the identification of these latter is made , say , from left to right .",
    "larger spins denote the irreducible characters whose ordering is left invariant by the dynamics .",
    "dots signal the locations of updated spins with rates indicated at the rightmost column ( see eq.([rates ] ) and fig.[processes]).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=65.0% ] -0.2 cm    due to the highly convoluted form in which that sequence is obtained , it is clear that @xmath1 parallel spins well separated from each other may or may not form a reducible @xmath1-mer depending on the substrings in between . in that sense , the is conservation is non - local as it involves the whole configuration . more importantly , as mentioned in ref.@xcite note that two spin configurations @xmath62 are connected by the dynamics @xmath63 .",
    "as long as all ad rates are held finite , evidently this also applies in the presence of interactions at @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the is uniquely labels all subspaces left invariant by the @xmath1-mer dynamics , and regardless in which order the reducible groups are removed . in particular , for @xmath56 the af state is therefore _",
    "unreachable _ either from initially empty or closed packed chains as these latter belong to ns sectors , whereas an af configuration is already irreducible .",
    "we will further discuss this issue in sec.iiic when characterizing the actual ground state in ns spaces for @xmath65 .",
    "now it is clear that the number of combinations forming all irreducible sequences for @xmath66 grows exponentially with the number of characters or string length @xmath67 ( with @xmath68 ) .",
    "more specifically , a straightforward analysis of a recursive relation for this @xmath69-dependent quantity @xcite , shows that for large @xmath70 and @xmath56 the number of invariant subspaces or string sectors increases as fast as @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the largest root of @xmath73 . as for dimers , where this ad process reduces to a spin exchange kinetics @xcite",
    ", it is worth pointing out that although the is construction is still well defined , in this case all strings simply consist of af sequences of lengths @xmath74 ; each one ( except @xmath75 ) having two possible orientations .",
    "so , these @xmath76 strings just correspond to each of the @xmath77 total magnetizations left invariant by the kawasaki dynamics .      turning to the evolution operator ,",
    "it is convenient at this point to move to the domain wall or kink representation , so as to halve the number of machine operations in the diagonalizations of sec.iii . in that two - to - one mapping ( outlined before in fig.[processes ] ) , new ising variables @xmath78 with energy @xmath79 stand on dual chain locations where pairing and diffusion of kinks ( @xmath80 ) may take place .",
    "such dual processes can then be schematized as    @xmath81{\\circ \\cdots\\,}_{k-1}\\ ; 1\\;\\ ;    &   \\underbracket[0pt]{\\rightleftarrows}_{\\mathlarger r_{\\!_- } } & \\;\\ ;   \\circ\\;\\ ,   \\underbracket[0.4pt]{\\circ \\cdots\\,}\\;\\circ\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ , ( { \\rm pairing}\\,,\\;\\delta e = \\mp 4 j)\\,,\\\\ \\nonumber\\\\ 1 \\ ; \\underbracket[0.4pt]{\\circ \\cdots\\,}_{k-1}\\;\\circ\\;\\ , & \\underbracket[0pt]{\\rightleftarrows}_{1/2 } & \\;\\ ; \\circ \\;\\ ,   \\underbracket[0.4pt]{\\circ \\cdots\\,}\\ , 1\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; ( { \\rm diffusion}\\,,\\;\\delta e = 0)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with all brackets involving @xmath82 vacancies ( @xmath83 ) in the dual chain .",
    "now , thinking of these kink configurations as 1/2-spinors states @xmath84 ( say in the @xmath10 direction ) , clearly these processes can be associated with the action of usual raising and lowering operators @xmath85 . more specifically , introducing the projectors @xmath86 [ here playing the role of the kronecker delta in eq.([rates ] ) ] , so as to allow transitions mediated only by empty intervals @xmath87 $ ] , then the operational nondiagonal counterparts of eq.([ndiag ] ) accounting for both pairing and diffusion events sketched in ( 9 ) , are respectively given by    @xmath88    although this would leave us with a nonsymmetric evolution operator , we can now exploit detailed balance to bring eq.([pair ] ) into a symmetric form . in this context",
    "this amounts to considering the nonunitary spin rotation @xmath89 -0.2 cm with pure imaginary angles @xmath90 .",
    "since @xmath91 is diagonal and its matrix elements @xmath92 just involve the above kink energies , then all transition rates derived from eq.([ndiag ] ) will transform as @xmath93 taking into account that @xmath94 also comply with detailed balance [ eq.([db ] ) ] , it is thus clear that in the transformed representation all these nondiagonal elements become symmetrical , i.e. @xmath95^{1/2}$ ] . in particular , under the spin rotation ( [ rot ] ) the pairing terms of eq.([pair ] ) transform as @xmath96 while leaving projectors ( [ proj ] ) and all diffusion terms of eq.([diff ] ) unchanged .",
    "thus , collecting the contributions of @xmath97 , the symmetrized operational analog of eq.([ndiag ] ) is now given by @xmath98    to complete the construction of the evolution operator , we last turn to the diagonal matrix elements of eq.([diag ] ) needed for conservation of probability . by definition , these elements count the number of weighted manners in which a given configuration @xmath99 can evolve to different ones either in one pairing or diffusion step .",
    "as before , this can be tracked down in terms of the above @xmath100 projectors , while concurrently probing the appropriate occupancy of kinks and vacancies at sites @xmath101 .",
    "so , in adding those diagonal contributions the counterpart of eq.([diag ] ) becomes @xmath102\\,,\\ ] ] which in turn is left invariant by the spin rotation ( [ rot ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath6 ( glauber dynamics ) no projectors are necessary and @xmath103 fully recovers the bilinear form of ref.@xcite , being ultimately reducible to a free fermion hamiltonian .",
    "by contrast , for @xmath104 projectors ( [ proj ] ) introduce correlated pairing and hopping terms as well as many - body interactions , in which case the evolution operator is no longer soluble ( cf .",
    "however fig.[four]a in sec.iiia ) .    as for the string sectors obtained from the reduction rules",
    "@xcite summarized in sec.iia , it can be readily checked that in the dual representation those reductions amount to deleting @xmath1-contiguous vacancies ( @xmath105 ) , along with replacing kink pairs with @xmath82 vacancies in between by just one vacancy ( @xmath106 ) . as a result of the repeated applications of these reductions one",
    "is left with string sequences of length @xmath68 where there can be no more than @xmath107 consecutive vacancies , each sequence being left invariant by the dual dynamics . in practice , to deploy a complete set of ns configurations ( where the diagonalizations of sec.iii are carried out ) , we shall successively apply eq.([sim ] ) to the states stemming from an initial one in that sector until this latter is exhausted .",
    "armed with @xmath108 acting on generic kink states , we can now implement a lanczos diagonalization procedure @xcite without having to store in memory the matrix representation of the evolution operator . as mentioned in sec.i ,",
    "we focus on the ns sector ( @xmath109 ) containing the initially empty chain and restrict ourselves to the cases of @xmath110 and 4 .",
    "firstly , as a consistency check , we verified that transforming the boltzmann distribution @xmath111 with rotation ( [ rot ] ) and @xmath112 , actually produces a ground state of @xmath113 with eigenvalue @xmath35 .",
    "this also served to start up the lanczos recursion but with a random initial state chosen orthonormal to that equilibrium direction . in turn , all subsequent states generated by the lanczos algorithm were also reorthogonalized to @xmath114 .",
    "thereafter , we obtained the first excited eigenmodes of @xmath113 for lengths of up to @xmath115 for @xmath110 and @xmath116 for @xmath59 , the main limitation for this being the exponential growth of the space dimensionality in @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "in this situation , after a quench to low - temperature regimes the large - time dynamics of @xmath109 is essentially mediated by kinks that diffuse at no energy cost ( rate 1/2 ) .",
    "owing to the projectors of eqs.([pair ] ) and ( [ diff ] ) however note that kinks can not cross each other , neither annihilate in the presence of other kinks in between , nor if they diffuse through different sublattices . but taking into account the reduction rules referred to in sec.iib for the dual representation , there must be at least one interval with two kinks separated by @xmath117 vacancies ( @xmath118 ) ; otherwise the explored configurations would not be fully reducible to @xmath109 .",
    "hence , there are regions where kinks can always meet at a distance of @xmath1 lattice spacings and annihilate in pairs ( @xmath119 ) with rate @xmath120 , which in the limit of @xmath121 gives rise to a monotonous coarsening of f domains .",
    "therefore , close to the equilibrium regime of @xmath109 the characteristic time involved between pair annihilations is that for kinks to diffuse across a correlation length @xmath122 , so a relaxation time @xmath17 growing as @xmath123 might be expected .",
    "in fact , this is evidenced in figs.[fss](a ) and [ fss](b ) where scaling plots of the spectral gaps ( @xmath124 ) of @xmath113 are shown for @xmath110 and 4 respectively .",
    "as temperature is lowered the data collapse towards larger sizes is attained on choosing a diffusive dynamic exponent ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "this is also in close agreement with the slopes read off from the insets , in turn estimating these finite - size gaps in their low temperature limit [ @xmath126 .",

    "interestingly , it turns out that in lowering the temperature @xmath133 converges towards the exact solution of @xmath6 so long as the length of this latter case is rescaled as @xmath49 , i.e. @xmath134 . in particular , for @xmath135 we checked out that for all sizes in reach these gaps become numerically indistinguishable , at least within quadruple precision .",

    "to summarize , we have studied the low - temperature and large - time dynamics of extended objects ( @xmath1-mers ) which reconstruct and interact while adsorbing / desorbing in one - dimension . for @xmath2 the notion of irreducible string @xcite provided an exhaustive description of the unusual manner in which the phase space is divided in sectors left invariant by the dynamics ( sec.iia ) .",
    "although the number of such subspaces grows exponentially with the substrate size @xcite , we restricted the scope of this study to the so called null - string sector ( containing the empty lattice configuration ) , both for computational ease and for being a common starting point in the context of cooperative ad processes @xcite .",
    "thinking of these latter as multi - spin flip dynamics in ising chains , we have constructed their evolution operators in the dual or kink representation of sec.iib , by which we analyzed the scaling behavior of relaxation times in finite substrates .",
    "the resulting time scales were then read off from the spectral gaps obtained using standard recursive methods @xcite , ultimately enabling us to estimate dynamic exponents via the finite - size scaling hypothesis ( [ normal ] ) . in the case of f interactions ( sec.iiia ) , the numerical matching of these gaps in the low - temperature limit with those of the rescaled glauber operator ( @xmath200 , fig.[four]a ) , might come as a bit of a surprise given the many - body correlations introduced by projectors ( [ proj ] ) both in paring and hopping terms of eqs.([pair ] ) and ( [ diff ] ) .",
    "the close overlap of those gaps near the critical regime thus strongly suggests a diffusive growth of relaxation times @xmath201 [ eq.([exact ] ) , and data collapse of fig.[fss ] ] .",
    "this was also corroborated by simulated quenches of spin - pair correlations ( fig.[four]b ) , in all cases exhibiting ferromagnetic lengths which spread as @xmath202 . also upon normalizing all pair distances as in fig.[four]a ( @xmath203 )",
    ", these correlations were made to collapse into a single scaling function but different from that of the glauber or monomer case @xcite . whether this is due to the absence of conserved quantities , such as the irreducible strings or the sublattice magnetization differences of eq.([m - diff ] ) ,",
    "remains an open issue .",
    "owing to the metastable states appearing in the af situation ( sec.iiib ) , simulated quenches become impractical near the arrhenius regime , so we contented ourselves with the above finite - size scaling methods , this time applied to the normalized gaps of eq.(19 ) . the scaling plots of these latter ( fig.[af - fss ] ) , as well as the sequence of our higher approximants [ eq.([approx ] ) and table  [ tab1 ] ] ,",
    "are indicative of subdiffusive dynamic exponents well apart from @xmath204 . for @xmath110",
    "these seem to belong to the lifschitz - slyozov universality class @xcite characteristic of the ferromagnetic kawasaki dynamics @xcite ( in this context , formally analogous to that of @xmath7 under @xmath65 ) , although for @xmath190 the approximants of table  [ tab1 ] suggest a convergence towards a slightly slower dynamics .",
    "this nonuniversal aspect clearly deserves further verifications in larger sizes , but already the next effective exponent ( @xmath205 ) would involve diagonalizations in spaces of @xmath206 dimensions .    with further regard to nonuniversality issues",
    ", it would be relevant to extend this study to the dynamics of string sectors with finite density of irreducible characters , such as those considered in the noninteracting case of ref.@xcite .",
    "there it was found that autocorrelation functions exhibit a wide diversity in the manner in which these decay in time , depending on the studied sector . in our case",
    ", preliminary diagonalizations for @xmath140 in similar sectors however suggest that the diffusive picture found in sec.iiia still holds , though an understanding of the emergent low - temperature phases ( also highly degenerate ) would require further investigations .    in the null string subspace with @xmath65 ( where af ordering is unattainable for @xmath66 ) , that latter aspect was addressed in sec.iiic by exact enumerations in small chains alongside with the sampling of ground states in larger substrates .",
    "the former approach revealed both the appearance of growing jammed scales and finite residual entropies ( fig.[jamming ] ) , whereas the latter one -implemented by exploiting the decay pattern of fig.[decay]- disclosed nontrivial spin - pair correlations presumably long ranged in the thermodynamic limit ( fig.[ground ] ) .",
    "as an open problem also remains to elucidate to what extent these features , as well as the dynamic ones of sec.iiib , might be affected by the inclusion of a small magnetic field , i.e. a monomer chemical potential slightly apart from that set by their couplings .",
