    "in heavy - ion reactions at energies close to the coulomb barrier , couplings between the relative motion and the internal degrees of freedom in the colliding nuclei play a crucial role . a well known example is the enhancement of subbarrier fusion cross sections , compared to the predictions of a simple potential model , due to strong couplings to collective excitations  @xcite .",
    "coupled - channels analyses have been performed for various heavy - ion systems taking into account such coupling effects and have successfully accounted for experimental data for fusion reactions as well as quasi - elastic scattering at backward angles  @xcite .    conventionally , a few low - lying collective excitations , such as vibrational modes in spherical nuclei or rotational excitations in deformed nuclei , as well as few - nucleon transfer channels have been taken into account in the coupled - channels calculations . in the eigen - channel representation ,",
    "channel - coupling effects lead to a distribution of potential barriers  @xcite , and it has been well established that the barrier distribution can be directly extracted from experimental fusion and quasi - elastic cross sections . for fusion reactions , the barrier distribution is defined as the second derivative of the product of center - of - mass energy @xmath2 and fusion cross section @xmath3 with respect to @xmath2 , that is , @xmath4  @xcite . for quasi - elastic scattering , it is defined as the first derivative of the ratio of the backward quasi - elastic scattering cross section to the rutherford cross section with respect to center - of - mass energy , that is @xmath5  @xcite . the fusion and quasi - elastic barrier distributions",
    "have been found to behave in a similar way to each other , though the quasi - elastic barrier distribution tends to be more smeared  @xcite .",
    "these quantities are known to be sensitive to the channel coupling effects  @xcite .",
    "they can also serve for the determination of deformation parameters  @xcite .",
    "although the coupled - channels method appears successful for heavy - ion subbarrier fusion reactions , there is a long standing problem of the method that , in order to reproduce experimental fusion data , a significantly larger value of the surface diffuseness of the nuclear potential is required , compared to the value found from fitting the scattering process  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some recently obtained experimental data can not be accounted for by the conventional coupled - channels method .",
    "for example , fusion cross sections for several systems at deep subbarrier energies have turned out to be much smaller than the predictions of conventional coupled - channels calculations  @xcite .",
    "another example is the quasi - elastic barrier distribution for the @xmath6ne + @xmath7zr systems .",
    "the conventional coupled - channels analysis that takes into account only the collective excitations of the colliding nuclei fails to explain the difference in the experimental quasi - elastic barrier distributions of these two systems  @xcite .",
    "that is , although the experimental barrier distribution for the @xmath6ne + @xmath8zr system is much more smeared than that for the @xmath6ne + @xmath9zr system , the coupled - channels calculations yield similar barrier distributions for both systems due to the much larger deformation of the @xmath6ne nucleus .",
    "one possible reason for the smearing may be the effect of transfer reactions  @xcite .",
    "however the total transfer cross sections for these systems have been found to be almost the same  @xcite .",
    "therefore the difference between the barrier distributions has been conjectured to arise from non - collective excitations , that are not taken into account explicitly in the coupled - channels calculations .    in order to discuss how non - collective excitations affect low - energy heavy - ion reactions , in ref .",

    ", we carry out a similar analysis in three dimensions , using realistic spectra for the non - collective excitations . for this purpose , we choose the @xmath0o + @xmath1pb system .",
    "in addition to the experimental data for subbarrier and deep subbarrier fusion reactions  @xcite , as well as quasi - elastic scattering for this system at energies near the coulomb barrier  @xcite , almost all of the excited states of @xmath1pb up to 7.5  mev have been identified ( spin , parity , excitation energy and deformation parameter ) from high - resolution proton inelastic scattering measurements  @xcite . we will include these @xmath1pb excited states in our coupled - channels calculations and discuss the role of non - collective excitations in heavy - ion reactions around the coulomb barrier .",
    "note that a satisfactory description of the fusion cross sections as well as the fusion barrier distribution has not yet been obtained for this system with the conventional coupled - channels calculations  @xcite .",
    "that is , the height of the main peak in the barrier distribution is overestimated by the coupled - channels calculations ( see also ref .",
    "another motivation to choose the @xmath0o + @xmath1pb system in the present study is , therefore , to see whether the non - collective excitations improve the agreement of the coupled - channels calculation with the experimental data .",
    "in addition to our calculation for the @xmath0o + @xmath1pb system , we also study @xmath10s + @xmath1pb and @xmath11ca + @xmath1pb to investigate the dependence of the effect of the non - collective excitations on the mass number of the projectile .",

    "this approximation has been found to be valid for heavy - ion systems  @xcite , and reduces considerably the dimensions of the coupled - channels problem .",
    "we impose the following boundary conditions in solving the coupled - channels equations : @xmath24 for @xmath25 , together with regularity at the origin . here",

    "one immediately sees that the main peak in the barrier distribution is shifted in energy due to the non - collective excitations towards low energy and consequently the fusion cross sections are enhanced .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the adiabatic potential renormalization because the excitation energies for the non - collective excitations are relatively large .",
    "one can also see that the non - collective excitations do not alter much the energy dependence of the fusion cross sections , as can be seen more clearly by shifting the dot - dashed lines in energy as shown in fig .",

    "the non - collective excitations hardly modify the behavior of the logarithmic slope , @xmath47/de$ ] ( see fig .  [",

    "that is , the calculations with only the collective excitations do not account for the observed large logarithmic slope at deep subbarrier energies .",
    "this remains the same even if the non - collective excitations are taken into account .",
    "this indicates that the deep sub - barrier hindrance of fusion cross sections can not be explained simply with the non - collective excitations in each of the colliding nuclei ; some other mechanism , such as non - collective excitations of the one - body system after the touching of the colliding nuclei , has to be considered  @xcite .    as mentioned in sec .",

    "that is , the barrier is shifted towards lower energy and the higher part of the barrier distribution is smeared . however , the smearing is stronger than that in the @xmath0o + @xmath1pb system , because an effective coupling strength is in general approximately proportional to the charge product of the colliding nuclei  @xcite , and thus the non - collective excitations are effectively stronger for heavier systems .",
