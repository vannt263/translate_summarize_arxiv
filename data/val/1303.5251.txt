    "cancer is a genetic disease which is driven by the somatic evolution of cells  @xcite , where driver mutations for cancer increase the reproductive rate of cells through different mechanisms , e.g. evading growth suppressors , sustaining proliferative signaling , or resisting cell death  @xcite .",
    "tumors are initiated by some genetic event which increases the reproductive rate of previously normal cells .",
    "the evolution of cancer ( malignant tumor ) is a multi - step process where cells need to receive several mutations subsequently  @xcite .",
    "this phase of tumor progression is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of cells  @xcite .",
    "the requirement to accumulate multiple mutations over time explains the increased risk of cancer with age .",
    "there are several mathematical models to explain tumor progression and the age incidence of cancer  @xcite .",
    "the models have also provided quantitative insights in the evolution of resistance to cancer therapy  @xcite .",
    "the models for tumor progression are multi - type branching processes which represent an exponentially growing heterogeneous population of cells , where the key parameters for the process are : ( i )  the fitness landscape of the cells ( which determine the reproductive rate ) , ( ii )  the mutation rate ( which determines the accumulation of driver mutations ) , and ( iii )  the average cell division time ( or the generation time for new cells ) .",
    "the fitness landscapes allow the analysis of the effects of interdependent ( driver ) mutations on the evolution of cancer @xcite .    in this work , we present a very flexible tool ( namely , ttp , tool for tumor progression ) to study the dynamics of tumor progression .",
    "the input to our tool could be any fitness landscape , mutation rate , and cell division time , and the tool generates the growth dynamics and all relevant statistics ( such as the expected tumor detection time , or the expected appearance time of surviving mutants , etc ) .",
    "our stochastic computer simulation is an efficient simulation of a multi - type branching process under all possible fitness landscapes , driver mutation rates , and cell division times .",
    "our tool provides a quantitative framework to study the dynamics of tumor progression in different stages of tumor growth .",
    "currently , the data to understand the effects of complex fitness landscapes can only be obtained from patients or animals suffering the disease . with our tool , playing with the parameters , once the real - world data is reproduced , the computer simulations can provide many simulation examples that would aid to understand these complex effects .",
    "moreover , once the correct mathematical models for specific types of cancer are identified where the simulations match the real - world data , verification tools for probabilistic systems can be used to further analyze and understand the tumor progression process ( such an approach has been followed in  @xcite for the verification of biological models ) . in this direction , results of specific fitness landscapes of our tool have already been used in a biological application paper  @xcite . while we present our tool for the discrete - time process ( which provides a good approximation of the continuous - time process ) , results of our tool for the special case of a uniform fitness landscape in the continuous - time process have also been shown to have excellent agreement with the real - world data for the time to treatment failure for colorectal cancer  @xcite .",
    "tumor progression is modeled as a discrete - time branching process ( galton - watson process @xcite ) . at each time step , a cell can either divide or die .",
    "the phenotype @xmath0 of a cancerous cell determines its division probability @xmath1 and is encoded as a bit string of length four ( i.e.  @xmath2 ) .",
    "the death probability @xmath3 follows from @xmath1 as @xmath4 .",
    "if a cell divides , one of the two daughter cells can receive an additional mutation ( i.e. , a bit flips from wildtype @xmath5 to the mutated type @xmath6 ) with probability @xmath7 in one of the wildtype positions ( e.g. , cells of phenotype @xmath8 can receive an additional mutation only at positions two and four ; cells of phenotype @xmath9 can not receive any additional mutations ) .",
    "the branching process is initiated by a single cell of phenotype  @xmath10 ( resident cell ) .",
    "the resident cells are wildtype at all four positions and have a strictly positive growth rate ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) .    * fitness landscapes . *",
    "our tool provides two predefined fitness landscapes for driver mutations in tumor progression : ( 1 )  multiplicative fitness landscape ( mfl ) and ( 2 )  path fitness landscape ( pfl ) .",
    "additionally , the user can also define its own general fitness landscape ( gfl ) .",
    "a fitness landscape defines the birth probability @xmath1 for all possible phenotypes @xmath0 . following the convention of the standard modeling approaches , we let @xmath12 be the birth probability of the resident cells ( i.e. , cells of phenotype  @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "the growth coefficient @xmath14 indicates the selective advantage provided by an additional mutation at position  @xmath15 in the phenotype .",
    "_ multiplicative fitness landscape .",
    "_ in the mfl  a mutation at position @xmath15 of the phenotype @xmath0 of a cell results in a multiplication of its birth probability by @xmath16 .",
    "specifically , the birth probability @xmath1 of a cell with phenotype @xmath0 is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 if the @xmath15-th position of @xmath0 is  0 ; otherwise @xmath19 .",
    "hence , each additional mutation can be weighted differently and provides a predefined effect @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , or @xmath23 on the birth probability of a cell .",
    "additional mutations can also be costly ( or neutral ) which can be modeled by a negative @xmath14 ( or @xmath24 ) .",
    "if @xmath25 the fitness landscape reduces to the model studied by bozic et al .",
    "@xcite , which we call emfl  ( equal multiplicative fitness landscape ) and is also predefined in our tool . _ path fitness landscape .",
    "_ the pfl  defines a certain path on which additional mutations need to occur to increase the birth probability of a cell .",
    "the predefined path can be @xmath26 , and again the growth coefficients @xmath14 determine the multiplicative effect of the new mutation on the birth probability ( see appendix for more details ) .",
    "mutations not on this path are deleterious for the growth rate of a cell and its birth probability is set to  @xmath27@xmath28 .",
    "the parameter  @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) specifies the disadvantage for cells of all phenotypes which do not belong to the given path .",
    "_ general fitness landscapes . _",
    "our tool allows to input any fitness landscape as follows : for @xmath1 for @xmath31 , our tool can take as input the value of @xmath1 . in this way , any fitness landscape can be a parameter to the tool",
    ".    * density limitation .",
    "* in some situations , a tumor needs to overcome current geometric or metabolic constraints ( e.g. when the tumor needs to develop blood vessels to provide enough oxygen and nutrients for further growth @xcite ) .",
    "such growth limitations are modeled by a density limit ( carrying capacity ) for various phenotypes .",
    "hence , the cells of a phenotype  @xmath0 grow first exponentially but eventually reach a steady state around a given carrying capacity @xmath32 . only cells with another phenotype ( additional mutation ) can overcome the density limit .",
    "logistic growth is modeled with variable growth coefficients @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the current number of cells of phenotype  @xmath0 in the tumor . in this model , initially @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , however , if @xmath34 is on the order of @xmath32 , @xmath37 becomes approximately zero ( details are given in the appendix ) .",
    "our tool provides an efficient implementation of a very general tumor progression model . essentially , the tool implements the above defined branching processes to simulate the dynamics of tumor growth and to obtain statistics about the expected tumor detection time and the appearance of additional driver mutations during different stages of disease progression .",

    "the sample returns the number of cells which divided with and without mutation and the number of cells which died in the current generation ( see the appendix for details ) . from the samples for each phenotype",
    "the program calculates the phenotype distribution in the next generation .",
    "hence , the program needs to store only the number of cells of each phenotype during the simulation .",
