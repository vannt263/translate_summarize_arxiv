    "after the famous lectures of w.  thurston @xcite the study of @xmath1-dimensional manifolds was focused on geometric and especially on hyperbolic manifolds and orbifolds .",
    "an orientable hyperbolic @xmath1-orbifold can be obtained as a factor - space of the lobachevsky space @xmath2 by the action of a discrete subgroup of the group of isometries @xmath3 .",
    "so the hyperbolic @xmath1-orbifolds are connected with the discrete subgroups of @xmath4 known also as _",
    "kleinian groups_. since a general subgroup of @xmath4 is discrete if and only if each of its @xmath0-generator subgroups is discrete ( see e.g. @xcite ) , the class of the @xmath0-generator kleinian groups takes on special significance .",
    "this groups and in particular arithmetic @xmath0-generator kleinian groups were studied by f.  gehring , c.  maclachlan , g.  martin , j.  montesinos , a.  reid and others ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it appears , that the @xmath1-orbifolds corresponding to the @xmath0-generator kleinian groups may have a very complicated structure . in a special case of the groups with real parameters",
    "the orbifolds were studied by j.  gilman  @xcite , e.  klimenko  @xcite,@xcite ; and have been recently completely classified by e.  klimenko and n.  kopteva ( see @xcite ) .    in this article",
    "we consider the groups of hyperbolic isometries generated by three half - turns in @xmath2 .",
    "if the axes of the half - turns pairwise intersect then the group is isomorphic to a fuchsian triangle group , so the groups generated by three half - turns can be considered as a generalization of the fuchsian triangle groups . the generalized triangle groups are directly connected with the arbitrary @xmath0-generator kleinian groups ( see section  5 ) but have much more trackable geometric structure . thus , since all three generators of the groups have fixed points ( axes ) in @xmath2 , the fundamental groups of underlying spaces of the corresponding @xmath1-orbifolds are always trivial , so the underlying space of such an orbifold is a @xmath1-sphere @xmath5 or a counterexample to the poincare conjecture .",
    "further we will always suppose that the underlying space is @xmath5 . in section  2",
    "we describe singular structures of common generalized triangle orbifolds , which are naturally fall into eight types ( theorem  2.4 ) .",
    "the set of the generalized triangle groups can be parameterized by three complex numbers that correspond to the complex distances  @xcite between the axes of the generators . in section  3",
    "we use w.  fenchel s technics  @xcite to study this parameterization and its connection with the matrix representation of the group in @xmath6 .",
    "section  4 shows how to find the parameters of the group for the eight types of singular structures from theorem  2.4 .",
    "the connection between the generalized triangle groups and the @xmath0-generator kleinian groups and their usual parameterization is considered in section  5 .",
    "section  6 presents examples of common generalized triangle orbifolds with different types of singularities and in section  7 we consider an example for the exceptional case .",
    "_ acknowledgement .",
    "_ i would like to thank professor alexander d.  mednykh for interesting me in this problem and numerous helpful discussions .",
    "the underlying space of a generalized triangle group is @xmath1-sphere , so the singular sets are knotted graphs in @xmath5 with the orbifolds fundamental groups generated by three involutions . while depicting the singular sets we follow a common notation writing indexes of singularity near corresponding components and omitting indexes @xmath0 .",
    "we will use wirtinger presentation of the fundamental group of a knotted graph @xcite adopted to the group of orbifold @xcite , so the elementary arcs of the graph will correspond to the words in the group .    _",
    "common generalized triangle group _ is a kleinian group generated by three halftuns such that the fundamental group of the complement of its singular set in @xmath5 has also rank @xmath1 .",
    "this definition allows us in some cases to consider groups of the complements of the singular graphs instead of the orbifold groups .",
    "this saves from certain difficulties , which may arise because the considered groups have many involutions .",
    "the class of the common generalized triangle groups is invariant under reidemeister moves for graphs .",
    "this lemma is obvious because the reidemeister moves do not change the fundamental group of the complement of the singular graph .",
    "now suppose we have a knotted graph such that some three arcs of the graph correspond to the three elements generating the fundamental group of the complement of the graph in @xmath5 .",
    "then corresponding three involutions generate our generalized triangle group .",
    "the first thing we do is we draw a circle that contains a plane projection of the singular graph and using the reidemeister moves draw the generating arcs outside the circle :    here we have to note that lemma  2.1 is not enough to carry on this procedure because it does not say anything about the generators of the group , and what we want is to obtain the group generated by the three elements that correspond to the selected singular arcs .",
    "however , it is a matter of a simple case - by - case verification to see that the generators can be `` preserved '' and we leave it as an exercise .",
    "now let us see what singular structures are possible inside @xmath7 .",
    "the only restrictions we have are that the group should be generated by @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and that the corresponding factor - orbifold is hyperbolic .",
    "non trivial knots on singular arcs inside @xmath7 are impossible .",
    "suppose there is a non - trivial knot on a singular arc inside @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the complement to the singular set in @xmath12 .",
    "consider decomposition @xmath13 such that @xmath14 contains the knot and @xmath15 has precisely @xmath0 punctures ( see figure  2 ) . here",
    "@xmath14 could be obtained from the tubular neighborhood of the singular set , so the decomposition is always possible .",
    "we now apply van kampen theorem to @xmath16 . for @xmath17 :    @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath20 can not be obtained as a word of @xmath21 , @xmath22 since the knot is non - trivial .    by van kampen theorem",
    "@xmath23 here again @xmath20 can not be obtained as a word of the other generators .",
    "this means that the rank of @xmath24 is greater then @xmath1 , which contradicts the definition of the common generalized triangle group .",
    "since arcs of the graph can not be knotted with themselves , the singular graph has a stratiform structure shown on figure  3 with all the vertices inside @xmath25 ( we use the common notation for integer tangles with @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 for @xmath29 ) .    the singular graph in @xmath25 has no cycles .",
    "let @xmath11 be the common generalized triangle orbifold , and @xmath30 - the @xmath1-manifold obtained as the complement to the singular set of @xmath11 in @xmath12 . to prove the lemma it is sufficient to consider the first homology group @xmath31 .",
    "the canonical projection @xmath32 maps non of the generators of @xmath33 to the homology cycle that corresponds to the singular cycle in @xmath25 . since @xmath34 with no any elements of finite order",
    ", this immediately follows that @xmath35 which is impossible .",
    "note , that this argument does not work for the orbifold fundamental and homology groups because the homology groups are generated by the elements of the finite order ( see example in section  7 ) .",
    "lemma  2.3 makes it possible to push all remaining tangles out of @xmath25 by drawing vertices through the tangles as it shown on figure  4 .",
    "so for the graph in @xmath25 we have :    - it has no cycles ;    - it has no tangles ;    - the group of its complement is generated by ( six ) arcs coming into @xmath25 from the outside .    together with the assumption that the orbifold is hyperbolic this gives all we need to classify singular sets of the common generalized triangle groups . in the following theorem",
    "we summarize the results :    the structure of the singular set of a common generalized triangle orbifold is determined by the signature @xmath36 ( figure  3 ) together with @xmath25 corresponding to one of the cases @xmath37  -  @xmath38 ( figure  5 ) .",
    "orbifolds obtained from @xmath37 , @xmath39 , @xmath40with @xmath41 , @xmath42with @xmath43 and @xmath44 are compact ; while orbifolds obtained from @xmath40with @xmath45 , @xmath42with @xmath46 or @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath38 are non compact .    1",
    "we have dropped one more combinatorially possible case that can be obtained from @xmath50 deleting the arc , which joins the vertices , because corresponding groups are always generated by only two half - turns .",
    "2 some relatively simple singular structures from theorem  2.4 correspond to non - hyperbolic orbifolds ( see examples  6c , 6d ) .",
    "all such geometric orbifolds can be found in @xcite and we do not specially focus on non - hyperbolic case .",
    "3 a generalized triangle orbifold is uniquely determined by the signature and @xmath25 as it was shown above , however different signatures can correspond to the same orbifolds .",
    "in order to obtain a matrix representation for a group generated by three half - turns one has to fix the axes of the generators .",
    "we do this by means of complex distances between the hyperbolic lines ( @xcite , p.  67 - 70 ) .",
    "we define the _ complex distance _ between two oriented hyperbolic lines as follows : its real part equals the length of the common perpendicular to the lines and imaginary part is given by the angle between the lines , taken from the first to the second line respecting orientations .",
    "we call three complex distances between the axes of the generators by the _ parameters _ of the group @xmath51 .",
    "let us remark that starting from this place by group @xmath52 we mean the group with the given generators taken in a fixed order , so , in fact , we work with a _ marked groups _ generated by @xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54 ( here @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57  the complex distance between the oriented axes of the half - turns . )",
    "since the directions of the half - turns are undefined the parameters are defined up to orientation of the axes .",
    "we can canonically link the orientation of a hyperbolic line with the matrix of the half - turn in @xmath6 ( see @xcite , p.  63 ) .",
    "this means that fixing the directions of the axes of generators equals choosing the inverse image after canonical projection @xmath58 of our @xmath4-subgroup in @xmath6 . following common agreement we usually call this inverse image by representation of our group in @xmath6 .",
    "complex vector @xmath59 determines group @xmath52 uniquely up to conjugation in @xmath4 , i.e. if @xmath60 then there exists @xmath61 such that @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "consider the axes of the half - turns @xmath53 in @xmath2 .",
    "we endow the axes by orientations and join them in couples by common perpendiculars .",
    "the result is a hyperbolic right - angled hexagon ( figure  6 ) .",
    "vector @xmath59 represents three complex lengths of the sides of our hexagon which are common perpendiculars of the given axes . by theorem from @xcite ( p.  94 ) three",
    "pairwise non - adjacent sides define right - angled hexagon uniquely up to simultaneous change of orientations of the other three sides .",
    "it means that any other hexagon defined by another group with the same parameters can be translated to the given one by a hyperbolic isometry .",
    "this isometry obviously defines the required conjugation @xmath61 .",
    "it may seem that we have missed the possibility of changing of the orientations of the axes but we have already remarked that the orientations effect only representation of the group in @xmath6 but not isometries themselves .",
    "so in this situation we can change the orientations as it is needed .",
    "next thing to do is to find out some convenient representation for @xmath52 in @xmath6 and describe it in terms of @xmath59 .",
    "we denote the matrices corresponding to the half - turns in @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 by capitals @xmath37 , @xmath39 , @xmath65 .",
    "half - turn in oriented hyperbolic line @xmath66 is represented by a matrix @xmath67 of the form @xmath68 , which is characterized by @xmath69 or equivalently @xmath70 .",
    "this matrix @xmath71 is called _ the normalized line - matrix _ of line @xmath66 . by extending transformation @xmath71 to the absolute @xmath72 it is easy to find the set of its fixed points in @xmath73 denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "geometrically the fixed points @xmath75 are the ends of the arc orthogonal to @xmath76 which presents line @xmath66 in the upper - space model of @xmath2 .    after a suitable conjugation of the group @xmath77 in @xmath6",
    "one can suppose that @xmath78 , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) .",
    "we have : @xmath82 where @xmath83 since @xmath84 .    to find @xmath85 and @xmath86 in terms of @xmath59 we use the following important formula , which allows to find the complex distance between hyperbolic lines @xmath87 , @xmath88 from the matrices @xmath89 , @xmath90 of the lines ( @xcite , p.  68 ) : @xmath91    denote @xmath92 ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath0 ) .",
    "then @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97    we obtain system of equations on @xmath85 and @xmath86 : @xmath98 solving this equations we find out all parameters in our representation .",
    "let us remark that this system has not unique solution but it really does not matter , because different solutions give representations of the groups @xmath51 which are conjugate in @xmath4 . the last statement is a direct consequence of lemma  3.1 since by the construction the different solutions correspond to the same @xmath99 . for definiteness we can always fix the analytic branches of the square roots in the following formulas .",
    "now we can write down the representation of @xmath52 in @xmath6 :    @xmath100 @xmath101    to obtain the representation of @xmath52 in @xmath4 one has to consider the image of the representation in @xmath6 under canonical projection @xmath58 .",
    "knowing the structure of the singular set of a generalized triangle orbifold one can obtain a presentation of its fundamental group and a representation of the group in @xmath6 .",
    "this representation is defined by complex parameters @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 , so it is possible to find the parameters , which correspond to a given singular structure . in this section and in section  6",
    "we show how it can be carried on for the common generalized triangle groups .",
    "suppose we are given a singular set of a common generalized triangle orbifold ( figure  3 ) .",
    "using wirtinger algorithm we can start from the given three arcs @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and passing through the tangles obtain words on @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 corresponding to all the other arcs .",
    "it is obvious that until we come to the central part of the diagram ( @xmath25 ) , we do not obtain any equations on the generators , so _ all the words in the presentation of the group come from @xmath25 _ ( figures  3 , 5 ) .",
    "equations defining parameters are then obtained by taking traces of corresponding words in @xmath6 . with the help of the well known formulas",
    "@xmath105 the traces of the words on @xmath37 , @xmath39 , @xmath65 can be expressed in terms of @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( an explicit expression for @xmath109 in terms of @xmath110 can be obtained using ( 1 ) ) .",
    "since we have three complex parameters we always need three independent equations to define them .",
    "in the remaining part of this section we will give the presentations of the groups and corresponding equations for each of the cases @xmath111  from theorem  2.4 .",
    "it follows from @xcite that one of the words @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 in the fundamental group is always a corollary of two other .",
    "however by the rigidity argument in the matrix group all the three words are independent and give three independent equations on the parameters .",
    "see example  6a for the illustration .    it can be seen that word @xmath115 has an odd length , which follows that in this case we need the expression for @xmath109 . actually , this is the only case where we may need the expression .",
    "the third equation follows from the fact that the multiple of two half - turns with the parallel axes is a parabolic isometry , so @xmath113 is a parabolic corresponding to the cusp .",
    "we choose sign @xmath116 for the trace of the parabolic element because the axes of the half - turns have the same directions .    here ,",
    "as in case @xmath7 , we again have a word @xmath117 of an odd length , but since @xmath118 we can easily avoid using the explicit expression for @xmath109 in this case . really , using formulae @xmath119 we can present @xmath120 as @xmath121 $ ] where @xmath122}$ ] is a polynomial , and since @xmath123 we obtain equation @xmath124=0 $ ] .",
    "this procedure can be used for case @xmath38 as well .",
    "let @xmath125 be a discrete subgroup of @xmath4 . there is a natural way to associate to @xmath126 a generalized triangle group @xmath127 which is equal to @xmath126 or contains it as a subgroup of index @xmath0 .",
    "it follows that such properties as discreteness , arithmeticity and others of two - generator subgroups of @xmath4 can be studied using the generalized triangle groups .    the group @xmath127 is constructed as follows ( see @xcite ) : if neither @xmath128 nor @xmath129 are parabolic then let @xmath130 be a common perpendicular to the axes of @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in case of parabolic generator corresponding end of the line @xmath130 is the fixed point of the parabolic .",
    "obviously , this construction uniquely defines line @xmath130 for any kleinian group @xmath125 .",
    "let @xmath10 be the half - turn about @xmath130 .",
    "then there exist such half - turns @xmath8 and @xmath9 that @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( @xcite , p.  47 ) .",
    "so we obtain group @xmath51 which contains @xmath126 as a subgroup of index at most @xmath0 .",
    "visa versa starting from the group @xmath127 generated by three half - turns @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 one can easily obtain its two generator subgroup @xmath133 . since @xmath134 , index of @xmath126 in @xmath127 is equal to @xmath0 or @xmath94 depending on if @xmath8 is contained in @xmath126 or not .",
    "the set of two - generator kleinian groups is usually parameterized by three complex numbers @xcite : @xmath135)-2.\\ ] ] a common computation with traces shows that this parameters are connected with our parameterization for the corresponding generalized triangle group by the following formulas : @xmath136    since we have described all the singular sets of the generalized triangle orbifolds we can at least theoretically present an algorithm , which using equations from the previous section enumerates all the parameters corresponding to the generalized triangle groups and discrete two - generator subgroups of @xmath4 .",
    "the main practical difficulty is that the complexity of the equations grows as the singular structures become more complicated .",
    "the other point is that we have to cast away the redundant solutions of the equations somehow . in the next section",
    "we will show how this can be done for the examples considered , however we do not know any general method to carry on this procedure .",
    "let us also note that the suggested algorithm shows only that our set of parameters is semi - recursive : we can enumerate all the parameters of discrete generalized triangle groups , but there is no way to decide in a finite number of steps does a given triple of complex numbers define a discrete subgroup of @xmath4 or not .",
    "let us consider examples for different types of singularities from theorem  2.4 and find parameters defining corresponding generalized triangle groups . here",
    "we will try to give examples , which deserve a particular interest and have previously appeared in different situations .",
    "detailed descriptions of some other generalized triangle orbifolds can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "let @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 .    by taking traces of the words",
    "we obtain a system of equations on @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142tracer@xmath143(c++ , 242 lines ) to calculate trace polynomials for generalized triangle groups .",
    "the program is available on request . ] :    @xmath144    we are interested only in complex solutions of this system and by the symmetry of the singular graph all the three roots should be equal .",
    "the only such solutions are ( approximately ) : @xmath145",
    "so we have @xmath146 .",
    "the signs before the imaginary part correspond to the orientations of the generating arcs and do not affect the presentation of the group in @xmath4 .    the primitive polynomial of the root is @xmath147 , using the arithmeticity test for generalized triangle groups from @xcite it can be easily verified that the orbifold is arithmetic .",
    "it is also interesting to note ( see @xcite ) that the two - fold covering of this orbifold is weeks - mateveev - fomenko manifold   the hyperbolic manifold of the smallest known volume .",
    "( of course , here we could use the symmetry of the singular graph from the beginning and initially suppose @xmath148 .",
    "it would considerably simplify the calculations but leads to some loss of generality . )    equations on @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 : @xmath152    we will consider only @xmath153 . up to the symmetry and change of orientation",
    "the system has only one complex solution , which defines the complex place of the orbifold group : @xmath154 the squares of @xmath102 , @xmath103 are algebraic integers and by arithmeticity test @xcite the group is arithmetic defined over field @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "( for @xmath156 and @xmath157 the group has no any complex places , so the orbifold is not hyperbolic . for large values of @xmath158",
    "the group has more then one complex places induced by @xmath159 , @xmath160 and so it is not arithmetic . )",
    "equations on @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 : @xmath161 complex solution ( @xmath162 ) : @xmath163 ( here @xmath104 is always a real number ; for @xmath164 @xmath102 and @xmath103 are also real , so corresponding orbifolds are not hyperbolic @xmath1-orbifolds of finite volume . according to @xcite for @xmath156 the orbifold admits the spherical structure and for @xmath153 it is euclidean . )    as it was shown in @xcite the considered orbifolds can be obtained as the factor - orbifolds of fibonacci manifolds @xmath165 by their full groups of isometries . so using the arithmeticity test from @xcite",
    "we can now easily find all arithmetic fibonacci manifolds ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the field of definition of the orbifold group @xmath166 $ ] has exactly one complex place only if @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 @xmath171 , @xmath172 ; it is a matter of direct verification that this cases satisfy the remaining conditions of the arithmeticity test .",
    "thus the orbifolds and corresponding fibonacci manifolds are arithmetic for @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 @xmath171 , @xmath172 .",

    "the system has exactly one pair of complex - conjugate roots for any @xmath175 ( for @xmath156 the orbifold is euclidean ) , this roots give the values of parameters @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath104 defining the orbifold group .",
    "since the analytic formulas for the solutions are rather complicated we do not give them here .",
    "one can see that the field of definition @xmath178 $ ] of the group has exactly one complex place iff @xmath153 , @xmath179 , @xmath169 , and it is easy to check the other conditions of the arithmeticity test @xcite for this values of @xmath158 .",
    "so we obtain , that the orbifolds are arithmetic for @xmath153 , @xmath179 , @xmath169 .",
    "this groups and orbifolds first appeared in @xcite as an infinite one - parameter family extending one of the three regular tessellations of @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the corresponding family for the one of the two remaining regular tessellations is also known @xcite and consists of fibonacci manifolds considered in the previous example ; and , finally , for the third tessellation the question of constructing such a family is still open .",
