    "one of the key issues in the theory of heavy fermion materials is the size of the fermi surface .",
    "it is traditional to think that each spin-@xmath0 localized moment , through the kondo effect , contributes a kondo resonance .",
    "these kondo resonances , which are fermionic , combine with the conduction electrons to form ( very heavy ) quasiparticles . in this way",
    ", the local moments ultimately become a part of the low - energy electronic fluid.@xcite this is reflected in the size of the fermi surface : the fermi momentum @xmath1 is `` large '' in the sense that the fermi surface encloses a volume that counts the number of both conduction electrons and local moments.@xcite this is in contrast to a `` small '' fermi momentum @xmath2 , which would correspond to a fermi surface that has a volume counting only the number of conduction electrons .",
    "while some questions have been occasionally raised , including the exhaustion problem noted by nozires,@xcite this picture has been thought to apply everywhere in the heavy fermion phase diagram.@xcite    recently , the question about the size of the fermi surface has gained renewed importance in the light of the anomalous behavior observed in the vicinity of the antiferromagnetic quantum critical point ( qcp).@xcite particularly noteworthy are the experiments in cecu@xmath3au@xmath4 , ybrh@xmath5si@xmath5 , and related systems,@xcite which observed non - gaussian behavior .",
    "these experiments have inspired the development of locally critical quantum phase transitions@xcite and related theoretical pictures.@xcite in these pictures , the paramagnetic heavy fermion metal phase , as usual , contains fully developed kondo resonances , with a large fermi momentum @xmath6 .",
    "it is argued that the kondo effect can be destroyed as the system approaches a qcp and goes into an antiferromagnetic metal phase , by some competing processes : the local moments in such a lattice setting are also coupled to some fluctuating magnetic field , which impedes the kondo effect .",
    "once the kondo effect is destroyed , the local moments are no longer a part of the electron fluid and the fermi surface becomes small .",
    "other theoretical works have proposed paramagnetic phases in which the kondo effect is destroyed due to the fractionalization taking place in the localized - spin component.@xcite one of the important questions that these theoretical developments raised is whether quantum transitions between phases with very different fermi momenta is necessarily first order or can be continuous . only in the latter case",
    "can transitions between such phases serve as a mechanism for the non - fermi liquid behavior observed in the heavy fermion metals . in this paper",
    "we address this issue in models in one dimension , where they are amenable to controlled computation .",
    "we show that continuous transitions from small to large fermi momenta can indeed take place in a one dimensional kondo lattice model away from half - filling .",
    "we now discuss a few additional background issues before we go into the details of our analysis .",
    "we prefer to speak about small and large fermi momenta as opposed to small and large fermi volumes .",
    "the situation in the paramagnetic phase is straightforward and is standard in the heavy fermion literature.@xcite whenever the kondo effect takes place , the localized spins are part of the low - energy electron fluid .",
    "the fermi momentum in this case is the same as that when each localized spin is replaced by an electron orbital and , in addition , with all two - particle interactions turned off ( i.e. , a non - interacting anderson lattice model ) .",
    "we call this fermi momentum a _ large _ fermi momentum . on the other hand , in the absence of the kondo effect , localized spins  being charge neutral  are not part of the electron fluid .",
    "the fermi momentum is that of the conduction electrons alone with all interactions turned off .",
    "this is defined as a _ small _ fermi momentum .",
    "clearly the fermi volume ( more precisely , fermi length in one dimension and fermi area in two dimensions ) is different in the two cases .",
    "a transition between a large - fermi - momentum phase and a small - fermi - momentum phase involves a jump in fermi volumes .",
    "( this is distinct from other electronic topological transitions.@xcite for example , in the case of lifshitz transitions in metals , the fermi volume changes continuously , while the behavior of the density of states is anomalous . )",
    "the situation is more subtle in an ordered phase that breaks translational invariance .",
    "this includes states with either an antiferromagnetic order or a spin - peierls order . in the case of even - integer - fold breaking of discrete translational invariance of the hamiltonian ,",
    "the fermi volumes ( fermi area in two dimensions and fermi length in one dimension ) in the reduced brillouin zone would be the same regardless of whether the local moments are a part of the electron fluid or not .    however , for commensurate ordering , large fermi momentum and small fermi momentum can still be defined as follows .",
    "the key distinction is again whether local moments are a part of the electron fluid .",
    "we define a large fermi momentum to be one that is associated with each localized spin being replaced by an electron orbital , all two - particle interactions turned off , but in the presence of an infinitesimal static field that characterizes the symmetry breaking .",
    "( in a commensurate antiferromagnetic metal phase , this field would be a static staggered magnetic field . )",
    "likewise , we define a small fermi momentum to be that associated with conduction electrons alone , with all two - particle interactions turned off , and in the presence of the same infinitesimal static field . in dimensions higher than one , the corresponding large fermi surface and small fermi surface have different topologies and , hence , represent distinct quantum phases.@xcite in one dimension , on the other hand , the only distinction between the two is the actual location of the fermi momentum ; the two phases may not necessarily be distinct if there are no additional order parameters that differentiate them .",
    "the system of interest consists of a one - dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) coupled to a one - dimensional spin-@xmath0 chain via kondo interaction .",
    "the spins in the spin chain @xmath7 interact with each other by nearest - neighbor ( nn ) and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) interactions .",
    "the 1deg is characterized by fermi energy @xmath8 and fermi momentum @xmath9 .",
    "we take the lattice constants for both the conduction electrons and spin chains to be equal to @xmath10 . away from half - filling ,",
    "@xmath11 so that the 1deg and the spin chain are incommensurate with each other .",
    "the nature of fermi momentum in various phases of such a one - dimensional kondo lattice has been addressed in the past . that the fermi momentum in the kondo phase is indeed @xmath1 is supported by a generalized luttinger s",
    "theorem,@xcite derived in a way analogous to that for the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem , and by the numerical calculations.@xcite however , indications for phases with small fermi momentum have been shown in more recent density matrix renormalization group calculations@xcite and the effects of spin dimerization in this context have been recently discussed.@xcite    in absence of kondo interaction , the 1deg and the spin chain are completely decoupled . in order to study the low - energy excitations , one can take the continuum limit so that 1deg will be described as a luttinger liquid .    for large nn interaction , the spin chain will also become a chargeless luttinger liquid , with nnn interaction serving as a perturbation .",
    "when the perturbation becomes sufficiently large , the system undergoes a phase transition into the spin - peierls phase.@xcite when the nnn interaction becomes much larger than the nn interaction , the spin - peierls ordering persists , but it becomes more convenient to describe the system in terms of a `` zigzag '' model,@xcite in which the odd spins and the even spins form two separate chargeless luttinger liquids and nn interaction introduces a weak coupling between them .",
    "the spin - peierls phase is characterized by staggered bond order parameter , @xmath12 .",
    "thus , the spins form dimers , the translational symmetry is broken , and in certain limits one can even represent the ground state as a chain of singlets formed by nearest - neighbor spins .",
    "this phase has an exponentially small spin gap .",
    "the 1deg remains a luttinger liquid with fermi momentum @xmath9 .",
    "non - vanishing kondo interaction introduces a number of novel phases in the system,@xcite however , we will be primarily interested in limit where the kondo interaction is weak . in this case and for an incommensurate lattice , a relevant",
    "kondo coupling leads to a phase@xcite in which the electrons and some of the spins form kondo singlets @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the annihilation and the creation operators in the 1deg .",
    "the kondo singlets are further dimerized so that the phase is characterized by an order parameter @xmath17 .    due to the coupling to the charge sector",
    ", this order is associated with gapless charge - density modes @xmath18 at @xmath19 , @xmath20 so that the expectation value of this operator varies as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 [ a more detailed expression will be given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : kd - order - parameter],[eqn : charge - mode ] ) later in the text ] . for these modes",
    "the charge and spin quantum numbers are both zero .",
    "note that the charge - density modes are described by a local operator , however , due to the fact that they embed the kondo singlets , the order parameter @xmath17 becomes nonlocal . as a result ,",
    "the translational symmetry of the system _ is not broken _ and the order is hidden .",
    "furthermore , there is an exponentially small spin gap,@xcite which exists due to the fact that the order parameter is nonlocal and one can not distinguish paired spins from unpaired ones .",
    "the existence of the gapless charge - density modes at @xmath19 implies that the system should be described as one with a large fermi momentum .",
    "we will argue in the following for a new co - existence phase . in the kondo dimer phase the spins",
    "can further dimerize , producing a mixed phase in which the kondo dimer order coexists with spin - peierls order .",
    "this phase has both a broken translational symmetry and a large fermi momentum .",
    "in addition , we will show that , away from the spin - isotropic case , the decoupled luttinger liquid phase has a finite range of stability .",
    "this phase is paramagnetic and has a small fermi momentum @xmath2 .",
    "we now proceed to the quantitative analysis of the model , which appears to possess all the mentioned phases .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kinetic term of non - interacting one - dimensional electron gas ( 1deg ) with fermi energy @xmath8 , @xmath25 is heisenberg nearest - neighbor interaction between the spins in the one - dimensional @xmath0-spin chain , @xmath26 @xmath27 is heisenberg next - nearest - neighbor interaction in the spin chain , @xmath28 @xmath29 introduces anisotropy in the spin chain , whose exact form is not essential provided that the spin chain by itself ( @xmath30 ) is gapless .",
    "we can , for instance , take @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , which is an easy - plane ( @xmath33 ) anisotropy .",
    "[ for a discussion of the role of anisotropy , see appendix  [ sec : appen - ising ] . ] finally , @xmath34 is kondo interaction between the 1deg and the spin chain , @xmath35 we will focus on the antiferromagnetic case ( @xmath36 ) . as a reminder , here @xmath7",

    "then we can take a continuum limit for the spin chain and describe it also as a one - dimensional free chargeless fermion system with fermi energy of order of @xmath46 .",
    "hence , we can perform a similar decomposition of @xmath7 into right- and left - directed currents @xmath47 and @xmath48 , as well as the staggered spin @xmath49 : @xmath50 likewise , in the limit @xmath51 , the continuum limit of the spin chain can be taken using a system of two mutually noninteracting fermion gases characterized by the fermi energies of order of @xmath52 ( the `` zigzag '' model ) , with @xmath46 serving as a perturbation.@xcite for the single impurity kondo problem and for the commensurate kondo lattice problem , the most relevant part of kondo interaction is @xmath53 .",
