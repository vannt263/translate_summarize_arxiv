    "the mose project ( modeling eso sites ) aims at proving the feasibility of the forecast of all the most relevant classical atmospherical parameters for astronomical applications ( wind speed intensity and direction , temperature , relative humidity ) and the optical turbulence ot ( @xmath0 profiles ) with the integrated astro - climatic parameters derived from the @xmath0 i.e. the seeing ( @xmath1 ) , the isoplanatic angle ( @xmath2 ) , the wavefront coherence time ( @xmath3 ) above the two eso sites of cerro paranal ( site of the very large telescope - vlt ) and cerro armazones ( site selected for the european extremely large telescope - e - elt ) .",
    "the final outcome of the study is to investigate the opportunity to implement an automatic system for the forecast of these parameters at the vlt observatory at cerro paranal and at the e - elt observatory at cerro armazones .    the optical turbulence ( ot ) forecast is a crucial cornerstone for the feasibility of the elts : it is indeed fundamental to support all kind of ao facilities in an astronomical observatory and to perform the flexible - scheduling of scientific programs and instrumentation through the service mode .",
    "most of the scientific programs , associated to the most challenging scientific goals , require , indeed , frequently excellent optical turbulence conditions to be carried out . the traditional queue system , that is based on the quality of the scientific program but that does not take into account the ot conditions , leads necessarily to a paradox : the higher is the scientific challenge of a scientific program , the lower is the probability to complete the program itself . from this",
    "we derive that the service mode , that takes into account the status of the ot beside to the quality of the scientific program , is mandatory to optimize the exploitation of the elts . however , to implement a service mode we need to forecast the ot to know its status at different delayed times @xmath4 t with respect to the time at which the prediction is performed .",
    "the optimization of the _ use _ of a ground - based facility has therefore serious implications on the final scientific impact of the facility itself .",
    "we note , moreover , that the cost of a night of observation is of the order of hundreds of kdollars .",
    "the implementation of an ot forecast system leads therefore to a not negligible rationalization of costs versus scientific feedbacks .",
    "we remind also that , for evident statistical reasons , the advantage of the service mode can be fully achieved only if most of the available observing time is scheduled in this mode .",
    "for all these reasons elts plan to have , in their baseline configuration , permanent instruments located at different focal stations .",
    "it has been estimated that , at the e - elt , the typical time required to switch the beam from an instrument to another is of the order of 10 - 20 minutes @xcite .",
    "this is therefore the final minimal time - scale in terms of ot prediction that we can take as a reference .",
    "all these premises lead to the conclusion that our ability in forecasting the ot is fundamental for the success and the feasibility of the elts .",
    "the peculiar feature of the numerical approach , and more precisely of the mesoscale atmospheric models , is the possibility to describe a 3d map of the @xmath0 ( i.e. volumetric distribution of the optical turbulence in the troposphere ) in a region around a telescope of the order of a few tens of kilometers at a time t@xmath5 placed in the future .",
    "this is the unique method that aims at address directly the solution of the navier - stokes equation of the hydrodynamical flow above the earth .",
    "it is therefore intrinsically the most appropriate to detect directly a rapid change of the atmospheric status .",
    "the typologies of models that can be used to study thermodynamic evolution of the earth s atmosphere are : the general circulation models ( gcm ) , the non - hydrostatic meso - scale models , the models for large eddy simulations ( les ) and the models for direct numerical simulations ( dns ) .",
    "these models differ in their resolution and , as a consequence , also in the extent of the typical domain of the atmosphere that they can reconstruct .",
    "we deduce that each of these typologies of model is dedicated to resolve phenomena of different nature and that the numerical approach as well as the physics described inside each of these models is done following a completely different logic .",
    "the ot can not be resolved by the gcms because the spatio - temporal fluctuation of the ot is much smaller ( order of centimeter / meter ) than the typical resolution of the gcm ( @xmath616  km ) . with the dns",
    "the ot can be completely resolved but we can not forecast it because we definitely miss the link with initialization data i.e. with the evolution of the atmospheric flow at large spatial scales .",
    "the meso - scale models represent the right trade - off that permits to reconstruct the ot maintaining the link with the external spatio - temporal evolution of the atmospheric flow .",
    "the ot is completely parameterized in the meso - scale models . with the les the ot",
    "is partially resolved and partially parameterized . in principle",
    "it is possible in perspective to use the les to improve the resolution of the simulations if initialized with outputs coming from meso - scale models .",
    "it has been observed that , when the horizontal resolution increases and reaches values of @xmath4x smaller than 10  km , the hydrostatic models show a tendency in distorting the spectrum of the gravity waves , particularly in proximity of mountain regions .",
    "for this reason , non - hydrostatic models are more suitable to reconstruct the atmospheric flow on such conditions .",
    "this is the first paper of a series aiming at collecting the main results we obtained in the context of mose . in section [ for_par ]",
    "we present the parameters that we intend to reconstruct with such a model and the importance they cover in the context of the astronomical observations and in the observational scheduling . in section [ model ]",
    "we describe the novelties of mose with respect to the status of art and we briefly describe the model we use for this study : meso - nh plus the astro - meso - nh package . in section [ config ]",
    "we describe the model configuration used for the mose project . in section [ obs_data ]",
    "we describe the whole set of measurements we used for the model validation . in section [ vert_atm ]",
    "we present the model validation in reconstructing the vertical stratification of the atmospherical parameters . in section [ conc ]",
    "we present the conclusions of the study .",
    "in the context of the mose project we focused our attention on the following parameters that are strictly related to the optimization of the ao systems and operational and observational programs scheduling activities : all the astroclimatic parameters ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and the atmospheric parameters from which the ot mainly depends on .",
    "+   + * - surface temperature : * the knowledge of the temperature near the ground is extremely important to thermalize the dome and reduce / eliminate the dome seeing , the most important contribution of the seeing experienced on ground - based images . the seeing inside the dome can be very hardly modeled being that the turbulence develops inside a confined environment and the kolmogorov theory is rarely respected under these conditions .",
    "it has been proved @xcite that the dome - seeing is mainly determined by ( t@xmath7-t@xmath8)@xmath9 and ( t@xmath8-t@xmath10)@xmath9 where t@xmath7 is the primary mirror temperature , t@xmath8 is the temperature inside the dome and t@xmath10 is the temperature outside the dome , near the ground . once t@xmath10 is forecasted , it is possible to tune t@xmath8 and t@xmath7 so as to minimize the temperature gradients and eventually eliminate the dome seeing .",
    "the temperature gradient near the ground is moreover extremely critical to well reconstruct the optical turbulence near the ground .",
    "it is fundamental for us to know how good or bad is the model performance in reconstructing this parameter to discriminate the potential discrepancies of the model .",
    "+   + * - surface wind speed : * the intensity of the wind speed near the ground can strongly affect the ao performances because of vibrations induced by all critical structures such as primary and secondary mirrors ( particularly critical are the adaptive secondaries ) .",
    "vibrations produced by wind speed bursts are among the most annoying source of noise for these elements and the accuracy of the ao correction is directly proportional to the noise introduced by such a kind of vibrations",
    ". an efficient forecast of the wind speed intensity can usefully optimize the use of the most sophisticated ao techniques and even decide when it is better to avoid ao observations if conditions do not permit to achieve required conditions . besides , the wind speed shear near the ground is one of the main cause for ot triggering together with the temperature gradient .",
    "the interest in studying the ability of the model in reconstructing this parameter is therefore similar to what already said for the surface temperature",
    ". +   + * - surface wind direction : * the wind direction is one of the atmospheric parameters that are more frequently and easily correlated to the local seeing characteristics . the prediction of the wind direction can therefore give a direct information on the probability to have bad or good seeing .",
    "it becomes very important when the wind speed is strong because , under this condition , the effects of the wind speed on the adaptive secondary ( vibrations ) are strongly dependent on the wind direction .",
    "+   + * - vertical profiles on @xmath6 20  km : potential temperature , wind speed intensity and direction and relative humidity : * such a stratification can be obtained , in principle , by gcms .",
    "however , it has been proved @xcite that gcms are not reliable in the low part of the atmosphere particularly in proximity of mountain regions because of their too low horizontal resolution and a too smooth orography .",
    "moreover , it is also worth reminding that a meso - scale model can produce a continuous temporal evolution of the vertical stratification of these parameters with a temporal sampling that can be freely selected ( in our study we use a temporal sampling of 2 min ) while information provided by gcm is sampled only at synoptic hours ( 00:00 , 06:00 , 12:00 and 18:00 ut ) .",
    "the meso - scale model technique appears therefore as particularly interesting for systematic calculations of the temporal evolution of the wavefront coherence time at astronomical observatories . besides , the wind speed intensity shear ( together with the potential temperature gradient ) are the fundamental cause of the ot triggering .",
    "it is therefore important to assure us how the model reconstructs the vertical stratification of these parameters to be able to discriminate the potential causes of model discrepancies or failures .",
    "the potential temperature @xmath11 of an air parcel is defined as the temperature which the parcel of air would have if it were expanded or compressed adiabatically from its existing pressure and temperature to a standard pressure p@xmath5 ( generally taken as 1000 mb ) :",
    "@xmath12    where r is the gas constant r = 287 j@xmath13k@xmath14@xmath13kg@xmath14 , c@xmath15 is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure c@xmath15 = 1004 j@xmath13k@xmath14@xmath13kg@xmath14 , p is the pressure and t is the absolute temperature .",
    "it is preferable to study the stratification of @xmath11 instead of that of the absolute temperature t because @xmath11 is strictly related to the thermodynamic stability of the atmosphere that is one of the principal source triggering the optical turbulence . in the astronomical context",
    "we count already some studies aiming at characterizing the sites for their thermodynamic stability @xcite .",
    "+   +   +   + * - @xmath0 profiles : * the @xmath0 profiles tell us how the turbulence is spatially distributed in the whole atmosphere , where are located the main turbulent layers during a night .",
    "this is a fundamental information for the ao tomography .",
    "the algorithm used for the @xmath0 parameterization is the one described in @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to the same paper for the detailed description of the theory connecting the dynamic turbulence with the optical turbulence and the algorithms used in the meso - nh model . in the context of the mose project we also tested a modified / new algorithm ( new parameterization ) in order to test which of the two ones provides better model performances . in a forthcoming paper",
    "the algorithm will be presented as well as the results obtained .",
    "+   + * - integrated astro - climatic parameters : * in the context of the mose project it has been established to investigate the three most important integrated astro - climatic parameters : the seeing ( @xmath1 ) , the isoplanatic angle ( @xmath16 ) and the wavefront coherence time ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18^{-3/5}\\ ] ] @xmath19 @xmath20^{-3/5}\\ ] ] @xmath21^{-3/5}\\ ] ]    the knowledge of the values of these parameters is critical to manage and optimize the ao systems . the seeing is the main discriminant permitting us to identify the temporal windows in which the ao systems can be mostly effective , @xmath3 tell us how fast is the turbulence , @xmath2 tells us how much turbulence is present in the free atmosphere particularly in the high part of the atmosphere and it can be very useful to discriminate between ao observations to be done in narrow or wide field .",
    "which are the mose scientific goals with respect to the status of art ? in 1999 @xcite it has been proved for the first time that a meso - scale model could reconstruct reliable @xmath0 profiles . from a qualitative point of view",
    ", it has been proved that the shape of the profile could match the observed one , and from a quantitative point of view the observed and simulated integrated values of the turbulence present in the atmosphere were well correlated . in 2001",
    "@xcite a calibration method for the model has been proposed and the whole technique has been validated on a statistic of 10 nights comparing simulations with measurements taken from different instruments ( balloons and generalized scidar ) @xcite . it has been proved that the dispersion of the seeing simulated and observed @xmath4@xmath22 @xmath6 25@xmath23 was comparable to the dispersion obtained using different instruments @xmath4@xmath24 @xmath6 30@xmath23 . in a successive time",
    "the same technique has been applied in an autonomous way on a whole solar year at san pedro mrtir @xcite carrying out a complete statistical analysis of all the astro - climatic parameters permitting us to achieve the first complete and homogeneous analysis of the seasonal variation investigation of the ot ever done so far . in 2011",
    "@xcite the model / technique has been validated using a richer statistical sample of gs measurements performed on 43 nights uniformly distributed along one year at mt . graham . at the same time",
    "it has been also proved that this technique can be efficient in discriminating sites characterized by substantial different turbulence features .",
    "the meso - nh model has been applied to the internal antarctic plateau achieving two major conclusions : * ( 1 ) * it has been proved that such a model is able to discriminate between the sites on the top of the summit of a plateau characterized by a very thin surface layer ( dome c , dome a and south pole ) @xcite ; * ( 2 ) * thanks to the numerical technique ( meso - nh model ) , the first estimates of the ot vertical stratification ever done in the free atmosphere at dome a have been provided @xcite .",
    "+ we finally remind that , the heart of the ot parameterization used in our study @xcite has been implemented by the colleagues of mauna kea @xcite on the wrf mesoscale model for applications to the mauna kea observatory in an operational configuration . an extended review on alternative methods for the ot forecasts can be found in @xcite .",
    "we limit here to cases of an ot parameterized in a non - hydrostatical mesoscale model .",
    "the mose project aims at overcoming two major limitations that are typically encountered in studies focused on the optical turbulence forecast with atmospheric models : * ( 1 ) * the difficulty in having independent samples of measurements for the model calibration and model validation to estimate if and how the correlation between measurements and predictions on the validation sample changes with the increasing of the number of nights and to estimate if and how the statistical richness of the calibration sample affects the calibration itself ; * ( 2 ) * the difficulty in having a large number of simultaneous measurements done with different and independent instruments for the ot estimates ( in particular vertical profilers ) .",
    "this project is performed with the non - hydrostatic mesoscale atmospherical model meso - nh @xcite joined with the astro - meso - nh package for the calculation of the optical turbulence @xcite to perform the ot forecasts .",
    "an extended data - set of observations ( meteorological parameters and optical turbulence ) have been considered in the project .",
    "we took advantage of measurements obtained in the context of the site selection for the tmt ( american study ) at cerro armazones and on measurements taken routinely during the last decade and/or in a dedicated site testing campaign ( par2007 ) at cerro paranal ( details in section [ obs_data ] ) .",
    "all the numerical simulations of the nights presented in this study have been performed with the non - hydrostatical mesoscale numerical weather model meso - nh ] @xcite .",
    "the model has been developed by the centre national des recherches mtorologiques ( cnrm ) and laboratoire dareologie ( la ) de luniversit paul sabatier ( toulouse ) .",
    "the meso - nh model can simulate the temporal evolution of three - dimensional meteorological parameters over a selected finite area of the globe .",
    "the system of hydrodynamic equations is based upon an anelastic formulation allowing for an effective filtering of acoustic waves .",
    "it uses the gal - chen and sommerville @xcite coordinates system on the vertical and the c - grid in the formulation of arakawa and messinger @xcite for the spatial digitalization .",
    "it employs an explicit three - time - level leap - frog temporal scheme with a time filter @xcite .",
    "it employs a one - dimensional 1.5 turbulence closure scheme @xcite . for this study",
    "we use a 1d mixing length proposed by bougeault and lacarrre @xcite .",
    "the surface exchanges are computed using isba ( interaction soil biosphere atmosphere ) module @xcite .    the optical turbulence and derived parameters are not an intrinsic part of the meso - nh model but it has been developed by our team in an independent package .",
    "the package ( called astro - meso - nh ) , includes the algorithms for the 2 parameterization and all the other integrated astro - climatic parameters ( seeing , isoplanatic angle , wavefront coherence time , scintillation rate , spatial coherence outer scale , .. ) .",
    "the first version of the code has been presented in @xcite . since then",
    "the code have been improved along the years in terms of flexibility providing a set of further outputs and permitting us to carry out different scientific studies mainly addressing the reliability of this technique .",
    "both the meso - nh code as well as the astro - meso - nh code for the optical turbulence are parallelized with open - mpi-1.4.3 .",
    "the model can therefore be run on local workstations as well as on the high performance computing facilities ( hpcf ) cluster of the ecmwf , in parallel mode so as to gain in computing time ."
