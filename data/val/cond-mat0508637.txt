    "frustrated two - dimensional magnetic systems exhibit a rich variety of phases and critical points .",
    "the consequences of quantum or thermal fluctuations about the highly degenerate ground states of frustrated magnets are important to understand in the ongoing quest to find novel exotic quantum states @xcite .",
    "the past decades have seen a resurgence of significant interest in a systematic study of geometrically frustrated antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "geometric frustration arises in materials containing antiferromagnetically coupled moments which reside on geometrical units , that inhibit the formation of a collinear magnetically ordered nel state , and induces a macroscopically large degeneracy of the classical ground state .    for magnets with a discrete ising symmetry",
    ", the complexity of the ground - state manifold can endow the system with a continuous symmetry .",
    "such symmetry is of particular importance to 2d quantum magnets at low temperatures since then the mermin - wagner theorem applies , precluding an ordered phase @xcite .",
    "another possible but contrary scenario is `` order - from - disorder '' @xcite where zero - point fluctuations select a small class of states from the ground - state manifold since those states are particularly susceptible to fluctuations .",
    "this fundamental mechanism can produce an ordered symmetry - broken state @xcite .",
    "hence one expects weak competing fluctuations about the classical ground states to be able to generate new strongly correlated states and ( quantum ) phase transitions of unexpected universality classes .    from a theoretical perspective",
    ", it is natural to try to understand the role of frustration from extremely simple interactions and dynamics .",
    "the possibly simplest realization of classical frustration is found in the antiferromagnetic ising model on a triangular lattice ( tiaf ) .",
    "each elementary triangle is frustrated , and the tiaf is disordered even at zero temperature with a finite entropy density and algebraic decaying spin correlations @xcite .",
    "the effect of quantum fluctuations about the highly degenerate ground states can be studied in its simplest form by introducing quantum spin dynamics from a magnetic field which is transverse to the spin coupling . for this transverse field tiaf model , and its companions on other 2d lattices , moessner and sondhi",
    "have argued the existence of both ordered and spin liquid phases @xcite . in the limit of a small field ,",
    "the quantum ground state is constructed as a linear superposition of classical ground states which maximize the number of spins which can be flipped to gain transversal field energy at no cost in exchange energy .",
    "this yields a strong suppression of configurations and , since the tiaf is already critical at zero field , order emerges . as a result , there will be a discontinuity in entropy and correlations in the ground state at vanishing field and zero temperature . at a large transverse field",
    ", the tiaf has a gaped paramagnetic ground state .",
    "it is separated from the ordered state by a quantum critical point .",
    "the additional effect of thermal fluctuations has been studied quantitatively so far only in simulations @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of these frustrated ising systems can be found either directly in magnets with strong anisotropy , e.g. , in lihof@xmath0 @xcite , or indirectly ( via the equivalent ( 2 + 1)d classical model ) in stacked triangular lattice antiferromagnets @xcite with strong couplings along the stacking direction as studied in recent experiments on cscobr@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , transverse field ising models can also provide insight into some more complicated systems in certain limits .",
    "they may describe the singlet sector below the spin gap of frustrated antiferromagnetic quantum heisenberg models , e.g. , on the kagome lattice , since the latter model can then be formulated as a @xmath2 gauge theory which in turn is related by duality to the transverse field ising system on the dual lattice of the original heisenberg model @xcite . an ordered ising phase describes then in the heisenberg problem a paramagnet with spin waves forming the gaped excitations .",
    "a related approach to study heisenberg antiferromagnets is via quantum dimer models ( qdm ) on the same lattice @xcite .",
    "depending on the lattice symmetry , the qdm exhibits a disordered state ( on the triangular lattice ) @xcite , corresponding to a resonating valence bond or spin - liquid phase , or it is found always in ordered valence - bond solid phases ( on the hexagonal lattice ) @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the spin liquid phase renders the triangular qdm a promising candidate for quantum computing @xcite . for ising spins , there is also a direct correspondence between qdm s with just kinetic terms and fully frustrated ising models in a small transverse field on the dual lattice @xcite . in particular , the transverse field tiaf maps to the hexagonal qdm .    for comparison to the new developments presented in this work",
    ", we briefly review the salient achievements for the classical stacked and quantum tiaf obtained in earlier studies .",
    "symmetry arguments have been used to guess a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) theory for the ( 2 + 1)d classical stacked system @xcite .",
    "after translation to the quantum tiaf , this approach suggests a quantum critical point of 3d xy universality at intermediate transverse field strength and an extended critical phase at finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "however , the suzuki - trotter mapping relating the 2d quantum and ( 2 + 1)d classical systems involves a scaling limit with a diverging anisotropy of the classical exchange coupling which may invalidate a lgw approach @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latter approach has been put somewhat into question , mainly since it has been argued that it fails to describe the ( classical ) system at low temperatures since it neglects the restriction to classical spin values @xmath3 and thus geometrical frustration @xcite .",
    "very recent monte carlo simulation support the lgw based conjecture for the phase diagram but the actual computations were performed for the ( 2 + 1)d classical problem @xcite .",
    "recently , the weak field behavior has been also studied in terms of a quantum kink crystal @xcite .    in a recent letter @xcite",
    "the present authors have presented a string description of the transverse field tiaf in order to obtain a quantitative prediction for the phase diagram . in the present paper , we will give a full account of the relation between spins and non - crossing strings , including a more complete presentation of the relation to dimer models and its surface height representation .",
    "we exploit and extend the quantum dimer analogy in order to map the tiaf , at arbitrary transverse field strength , to quantum strings which result from the superposition of dimer configurations plus defects and a fixed reference dimer state . using the suzuki - trotter theorem @xcite",
    "we obtain a stack of coupled 2d layers of classical strings which in the suzuki - trotter limit of infinitely many layers can be described by the villain model @xcite .",
    "we show that the lgw action @xcite , which was employed in the vicinity of the quantum critical point @xcite , can be derived microscopically from the quantum string action if the phase of the complex lgw order parameter is identified with the displacement field of the string lattice .",
    "however , our approach explicitly takes into account frustration which is encoded in the topological constraint on the phase field resulting from the non - crossing property of the strings .",
    "this constraint restricts the phase field configurations of the order parameter and thus distinguishes our theory from the original lgw approach .",
    "our approach confirms explicitly the 3d xy universality of the quantum critical point , and allows to predict the phase diagram at _ arbitrary _ transverse field strength and finite temperature .",
    "using an entropy argument for the strings , we can determine the nature of the ordered phase .",
    "in this paper we present first a thorough discussion of the relations between ising spins on the triangular lattice , dimers on the hexagonal lattice and its height representation and elastic string lattices . after a introduction of the spin models in section [ sec : models ] ,",
    "we explore the relations to dimers and strings in section [ sec : classical_2d ] for the classical 2d ising model on the triangular lattice in order to set up the formalism for the following sections . in section [ sec : stacked ] we map the ising model on a stacked triangular lattice to ( 2 + 1)d string lattice which is described by a 3d xy model with a 6-fold symmetry breaking term . using the results of the latter section ,",
    "we perform a suzuki - trotter mapping of the 2d quantum ising system to the classical stacked model which enables us to predict a quantitative phase diagram for the quantum frustrated model in section [ sec : quantum ] .",
    "finally , we conclude with a summary and a discussion of potential extensions of our work in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we are interested in two models which are both based on the ising antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice ( tiaf ) .",
    "first , we study a classical three dimensional ising system which consists of a stack of tiaf s which are coupled ferromagnetically .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath4 with @xmath5 and where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 indicates summation over nearest - neighbor pairs in each tiaf plane .",
    "this system is fully frustrated in each layer , but has no competing interaction along the stacking direction .",
    "this model has been studied originally within a landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) approach by blankschtein et al .",
    "in fact , much of the physics of the stacked triangular lattice is similar to that of the two - dimensional triangular lattice .",
    "however , the presence of the third dimension has the tendency to stabilizes ordered phases .",
    "indeed , for all well - characterized materials which have triangular magnetic lattices , the long - range order at low temperatures is three - dimensional in nature .",
    "the stacked system is of direct experimental relevance since it describes the low - temperature physics of the ising - like compounds cscocl@xmath1 , cscobr@xmath1 and related materials where transition metal atoms form chains along the stacking direction which are coupled through three equivalent halogen atoms . for a review on these compounds",
    "see ref .  .",
    "almost the entire existing body of theory on this stacked system is based on the lgw approach , mean - field theory and numerical simulations with sometimes conflicting results for the low - temperature ordered phase .",
    "we will briefly review previous developments for this model in section [ sec : stacked ] .    as shall be demonstrated below",
    ", the previously introduced model is also useful in describing the two - dimensional quantum antiferromagnet which results from applying a transverse magnetic field to the tiaf .",
    "the latter system has the hamiltonian @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath11 are pauli operators , and @xmath12 is the transverse field .",
    "this model is of particular interest since it combines a standard realization of geometric frustration with simple quantum dynamics .",
    "the transverse field induces tunnelling between the exponentially large number of classical ground states at zero temperature .",
    "one can argue that the quantum fluctuations select a smaller susceptible class of the ground states .",
    "this would lead then to a reduction of ground state entropy , and an `` _ order from disorder _ ''",
    "@xcite phenomenon is expected .",
    "both the classical stacked magnet and the 2d quantum tiaf are related to the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) on the hexagonal lattice .",
    "we start with the description of the antiferromagnetic ising model on the triangular lattice in order to explain its relation to dimers and strings .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath13 where the couplings @xmath14 are equal to one of the three positive constants @xmath15 , @xmath16 or @xmath17 depending on the orientation of the bond @xmath18 relative to the three main lattice directions .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the ground state of this system has exponentially large degeneracy in the isotropic case @xmath19 , leading to a finite entropy density and the absence of order even at zero temperature . for all ground states of the general model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tiaf - ham ] ) each triangle has exactly one frustrated bond , and hence there is a one - to - one correspondence ( modulo a global spin flip ) of all spin ground state configurations to complete dimer coverings of the dual hexagonal lattice .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer ] : if one places a dimer across every frustrated bond , one obtains the corresponding dimer covering of the dual hexagonal lattice , where each lattice site in the hexagonal lattice is touched by one and only one dimer @xcite . if the two smallest couplings are equal , @xmath20 , then dimers can occupy bonds in directions @xmath21 and @xmath22 only and there is still a huge ground state degeneracy .",
    "but the entropy at @xmath23 scales now @xmath24 with the number of lattice sites , @xmath25 , due to the constraint that dimers can not touch each other .",
    "thus the entropy density vanishes and the system is ordered at @xmath23 but disordered at any finite temperature .",
    "( at finite @xmath26 topological defects have to be considered , see below . )",
    "if one of the three coupling constants is the smallest , then there is only one dimer ground state configuration with all dimers being perpendicular to the direction with smallest coupling , and order survives at finite temperature .",
    "the analogy to dimers can be expressed by the fact that the ising partition function in the limit of vanishing temperature is proportional to that of the dimers which reads @xmath27 where the sum runs over all complete dimer coverings of the hexagonal lattice , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the number of dimers being perpendicular to direction 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "here we assumed that @xmath30 , @xmath16 so that the weights for the two types of non - vertical bonds are given by @xmath31 and all vertical bonds have a weight of unity .",
    "of course , for the tiaf the isotropic case with @xmath19 is of most interest but for the dimer model itself anisotropic weights provide some interesting insight as will become clear below .",
    "we note that even at finite temperature the analogy to dimers will turn out to be useful but then defects ( triangles with all three bonds crossed by dimers ) have to be included .          in this subsection",
    "we make use of another mapping which relates dimer configurations to fluctuating strings which are directed and non - crossing @xcite .",
    "this mapping applies to general weights for the dimers but of primary interest is the tiaf at @xmath23 where the dimer weights are either unity or zero , and there is a one - to - one correspondence ( modulo a global spin flip ) of ising ground states to string configurations .",
    "the string representation results from the superposition of a given dimer covering and a fixed reference dimer covering where all vertical bonds of the hexagonal lattice are occupied by dimers , see fig .",
    "[ fig : height - line](b ) .",
    "the superposition is an `` exclusive or '' operation , i.e. , only if a given bond is covered by a dimer either in the original covering or in the reference covering , it will be covered in the superposition .",
    "the resulting superposition is no longer a dimer covering ( since dimers touch each other ) but an array of strings which are directed ( along the reference direction ) and non - crossing ( due to the fact that each site is touched by exactly one dimer in the original dimer covering ) @xcite . the fluctuations of the lines result from the non - zero entropy density of the spin system . or in other words , we map the zero temperature tiaf to a line lattice at a finite ( virtual ) temperature @xmath32 .    before we parameterize the string configurations , it is useful to introduce a height profile @xmath33 which can be associated with a dimer covering . if the lattice covered by dimers is bipartite , then there exists a well - defined ( single - valued ) height profile which is defined on the sites of the original ( triangular ) lattice",
    ". starting at an arbitrary site with some integer number , one follows a triangle pointing down clockwise and changes the height by + 2 ( -1 ) if a ( no ) dimer is crossed . repeating the latter process for all triangles pointing downward , one obtains a consistent height on all sites , see fig .",
    "[ fig : height - line ] ( a ) .",
    "if one subtracts the height profile of the fixed reference dimer covering from a given height profile , one observes that the previously introduced strings separate domains of equal height which is an integer multiple of @xmath22 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : height - line](c ) .",
    "it will turn out that the height profile measures the roughness , i.e. , the displacement of the strings from a perfectly straight configuration .",
    "the array of strings is characterized only by its density @xmath34 and the elastic line tension @xmath35 of the strings .",
    "the interaction between the strings consists only of the non - crossing constraint and thus introduces no additional energy scale .",
    "the configurations of a single directed string are characterized by its position function @xmath36 since overhangs are forbidden .",
    "the reduced energy of all strings is then @xmath37 first , we determine the line tension @xmath35 from a simple random walk argument .",
    "if @xmath38 denotes the mean string position , then the total mean squared displacement of a string of length @xmath39 along the @xmath40-direction ( after @xmath41 steps ) , with @xmath42 the triangular lattice constant , must be @xmath43 in order to be consistent with the result of the continuum model of eq.([conline ] ) . here",
    "@xmath44 are the three possible transversal steps .",
    "the different kind of steps correspond to the paths @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stiffness ] .",
    "the corresponding probabilities for the steps can be expressed in terms of the weights of the occupied non - vertical bonds as @xmath48 the mean position after one step is @xmath49 thus , after @xmath41 steps , the variance of the transverse wandering around the mean position is @xmath50 where @xmath51 , yielding the line tension @xmath52 the _ mean _ density of strings depends also on the dimer weights of the non - vertical bonds .",
    "it can be computed exactly with the result @xcite @xmath53^{1/2 } , \\label{density}\\ ] ] for @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath55 the density vanishes @xcite , corresponding to a kasteleyn or commensurate - incommensurate transition . for the isotropic tiaf",
    ", one has @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    before we introduce the relation between the string displacement and the height profile , and a corresponding continuum description , it is instructive to focus on the free energy of the string array .",
    "this will allow for an independent check of our random walk description .",
    "moreover , from the free energy one can determine the elastic constants on large length scales which are needed for the proper continuum model .",
    "actually , the density of strings is determined by the densities @xmath58 , @xmath59 of non - vertical dimers with weights @xmath60 , @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "this can be seen from the fact that along a cut perpendicular to the string direction each non - vertical dimer corresponds to one string .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_dimer ] ) that @xmath62 for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , where the number of triangular lattice sites , @xmath25 , equals the total number of dimers .",
    "the string density then reads @xmath65 now we change variables from @xmath60 , @xmath61 to @xmath66 and @xmath67 , see eq.([density ] ) .",
    "since @xmath68 , and using eq.([density ] ) , we have @xmath69 this allows us to derive a differential equation for the free energy density of the dimers , @xmath70 as a function of the parameters @xmath71 , @xmath72 of the string system .",
    "@xmath73 fulfills the equation @xmath74 integrating the latter expression yields the exact result for the lattice string model . in the continuum limit",
    "@xmath75 , the result simplifies to @xmath76 there is an alternative and simple approach to obtain the free energy in the continuum limit .",
    "the strings can be regarded as the world lines of free fermions in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the non - crossing condition is then implemented automatically by the pauli principle . in the limit of infinitely long strings ,",
    "the ground state energy density of the fermions equals the free energy density of the strings if the fermion mass is mapped to the line tension @xmath35 and @xmath77 to the temperature @xmath32 . from the expression for the ground state energy of one - dimensional free fermions",
    "follows immediately the reduced free energy density of the strings , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the reduced free energy ( per length ) of a single string , and the last term is generated by the reduction of entropy due to the non - crossing condition .",
    "a direct comparison of the free energies of eqs.([eq : f_dimers ] ) and ( [ eq : f_strings ] ) is not possible since the number of strings varies with the dimer coverings although the number of dimers is fixed .",
    "mean _ density of strings is fixed .",
    "hence , one has to consider the grand potential density @xmath80 for the string system which follows easily from the free energy density , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the chemical potential ( per string length ) .",
    "comparing eq.([eq : f_dimers ] ) and eq.([eq : j_potential ] ) , we see that @xmath83 exactly for the expression of the line tension which we obtained above from an independent random walk argument , see eq.([stiffness ] ) .",
    "thus in the continuum limit the ground states of the tiaf and the dimer model can be described as free fermions with their mass determined by our simple random walk argument on the lattice .",
    "now we turn to the structural properties of the string lattice .",
    "the most ordered state consists of straight ( `` flat '' ) strings which do not wander transversally .",
    "depending on the string density there are different commensurate and incommensurate states possible . for the discussion of the flat states we focus on the state with a maximal density of @xmath57 which corresponds to the most interesting case of isotropic couplings for the tiaf . in this case",
    "there are two non - equivalent classes of flat strings which are not related by shifts by a nearest - neighbor vector of the triangular lattice , see fig .",
    "[ fig : flat ] .",
    "these classes translate directly to different ordered spin states which are characterized by their sublattice magnetizations .",
    "one state , @xmath84 , is obtained by orienting two sublattices uniformly but opposite while the third sublattice has the same number of @xmath85 and @xmath86 spins , leading to zero magnetization .",
    "this , on average , locks the straight strings _ on _ the sublattice with zero magnetization .",
    "since each of the three sublattices can be chosen as the one with zero magnetization , equivalent flat string states are related by a shift of @xmath87 .",
    "the other state , @xmath88 , has up spins on two sublattices and down spins on the other sublattice which places the non - vertical dimers on straight strings that are locked symmetrically between the two sublattices with equal magnetization .",
    "the displacement @xmath89 from flat strings is determined by the original height profile @xmath33 of the corresponding dimer covering . since only non - vertical dimers",
    "are conserved under the subtraction of the reference covering , we will defined @xmath89 for each non - vertical bond of the hexagonal lattice . if a bond is occupied by a string segment , then @xmath89 measures the normal distance between the corresponding flat string and the center of the segment , cf .",
    "[ fig : height - line](c ) . since",
    "a shift of the height @xmath33 by @xmath22 corresponds to a string translation by the mean string distance @xmath90 , the displacement on each non - vertical bond is given by @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the coincident ( original ) height of the two hexagonal plaquettes which are joined by the non - vertical bond , see fig .",

    "@xmath104 is a periodic potential which reflects the discreteness of the lattice and favors an ordered phase with flat strings . since",
    "equivalent flat states are related by shifts of all straight strings by @xmath87 and since @xmath105 , the locking potential must have the form @xcite @xmath106 with @xmath107 . if @xmath108 the string lattice is sufficiently stiff and the potential @xmath109 is relevant ( under renormalization ) so that the strings lock into one of the flat states .",
    "interestingly , @xmath110 is independent of the line tension , and the locking potential is relevant for @xmath111 .",
    "however , the minimal string separation is @xmath112 ( corresponding to isotropic dimer weights ) , and hence @xmath109 is irrelevant at all possible densities .",
    "however , if there are additional interactions present which increase the stiffness of the string lattice , the lock - in potential might become relevant .",
    "in fact , we will see below that a coupling of many tiaf can render the periodic pinning relevant .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine the consequences of the lock - in potential for the spin configurations , which depend on the sign of that potential .",
    "to do so , we recall that the offset @xmath93 selects the lattice positions of the strings in the flat states .",
    "it has to be determined from additional information which is in the present case provided by spin configurations which correspond to flat strings and small fluctuations around the locked - in states .",
    "thus , we focus now on the isotropic tiaf so that the possible classes of flat states are those shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : flat ] .",

    "the entropy of such macroscopically flat states can be estimated from the number of string configurations on the hexagonal lattice for which each string fluctuates in a tube of width @xmath90 about its straight reference position , i.e. , @xmath116 for each non - vertical dimer @xcite .",
    "this puts a strong constraint on the spin states since a flip of a single flippable spin ( a spin with 3 up and 3 down spins as neighbors ) shifts a string by the hexagonal plaquette on which the spin sits . in the class @xmath84 the spins on one sublattice ( dark grey in fig .",
    "[ fig : flat ] ) can assume any of the @xmath117 possible states where @xmath25 is the number of triangular lattice sites .",
    "the maximal displacement of @xmath118 is obtained if spins on the other two sublattices are also flipped with respect to the perfectly ordered state @xmath88 which , however , is possible only for @xmath119 sites since the @xmath22 neighbors on the fully flippable sublattice must have the same orientation as the spin to be flipped in order to have directed and non - crossing strings .",
    "this yields @xmath120 configurations . for the fluctuations in class @xmath88 all spins on one sublattice ( white in fig .",
    "[ fig : flat ] ) are frozen .",
    "the sites of the other two sublattices can be divided into @xmath121 `` rings '' , each of @xmath122 plaquettes centered about a frozen site , and @xmath123 extra plaquettes between the rings . due to the constraints on the strings , each ring permits only @xmath124 spin states .",
    "for a given spin state on all rings , the extra plaquettes can only flip if its @xmath22 neighboring spins located on rings point up , which occurs with probability @xmath125 .",

    "finally , we discuss potential implications for the quantum phase transition in 2d ising spin glass models in a transverse field @xcite . from the analysis in section [ sec : quantum ] , we know that the 2d quantum frustrated ising model can be mapped to a system of classical stacked string lattices which is described by a 3d @xmath187 hamiltonian . with quenched randomness , the quantum spin system should be mapped to a 3d @xmath187 model with _ columnar _",
    ", i.e. , correlated disorder . if we assume that the lattice type ( and hence the geometric frustration ) is irrelevant for the universality class of the transition , we can argue that the quantum phase transition of 2d transverse field ising spin glasses should belong to the universality class of 3d @xmath187 model with columnar disorder .",
    "interestingly , this speculation seems to be consistent with recent numerical results for both a transverse field ising spin glass @xcite and a 3d @xmath187 model with columnar disorder @xcite .",
    "the two corresponding exponents , the dynamical exponent @xmath263 for the spin glass and the anisotropy exponent @xmath264 for the xy model , are indeed in some agreement .",

    "in this appendix we derive the boundary of the critical phase ( c ) .",
    "we start from the scaling result of eq .   with @xmath230 .",
    "this allows us to compute a relation between the critical couplings @xmath244 and @xmath225 . in the limit @xmath265",
    "we find @xmath266 where @xmath267 is the critical exponent of the 3d xy model , and @xmath268 .",
    "using the latter result again in the scaling formula of eq .   for arbitrary @xmath207 and with @xmath269 set to its critical value , we obtain @xmath270 which yields @xmath226 as a function of the inter - layer coupling @xmath222 at large but finite @xmath207 .",
    "we continue by introducing the bare coupling constant @xmath271 so that @xmath272 .",
    "the renormalized effective coupling constant will be denoted by @xmath273 .",
    "this notation allows us to take into account the fact that the renormalization of the couplings @xmath192 and @xmath222 is dependent due to their relation by eq .  .",
    "then the effective couplings can be written as @xmath274 now we use @xmath275 and @xmath276 in eq .  , and expand the resulting equation for large @xmath277 which gives @xmath278 multiplying with @xmath279 and using the relation @xmath280 for the quantum critical point , we get the final result @xmath281 which corresponds to eq .   if we denote by @xmath248 the coefficient in the latter expression . for consistency",
    ", it follows from @xmath282 and the definition of @xmath248 that the effective inter - layer coupling must diverge with @xmath211 according to @xmath283 with a characteristic @xmath284 which itself diverges for @xmath285 .",
    "since the height @xmath33 is defined modulo an arbitrary ( non - integer ) global constant @xmath286 , the minima of @xmath287 can be shifted by @xmath286 .",
    "however , @xmath104 remains unchanged since the string positions are not effected ( modulo @xmath87 ) by such a shift but then @xmath288 .",
