    "recently , neutrino oscillation experiments  @xcite have provided very strong evidence for non - zero , yet tiny , neutrino masses . in order to accommodate such small masses",
    ", it is widely believed that new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) is required .",
    "one of the simplest and most elegant mechanisms for generating a small neutrino mass is to introduce extra standard model singlets to the sm lagrangian , and allow them to acquire a very large majorana mass ( this is the well known seesaw mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "there are many important phenomenological consequences of neutrino masses .",
    "one of them is that individual lepton - flavour numbers are not conserved , which implies that sm forbidden processes such as @xmath4 may occur .",
    "however , given the size of the neutrino masses , the rates for charged lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) phenomena are extremely small in the sm plus massive neutrinos @xcite .",
    "there are other hints for physics beyond the sm , including the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "low - energy supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the preferred candidates for beyond the sm physics which solves the hierarchy problem .",
    "susy models can easily accomodate the seesaw mechanism , and susy even helps in the sense that it stabilises the ( very heavy ) majorana mass of the right - handed neutrino .",
    "furthermore , in such a framework , lfv processes in the charged lepton sector such as @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 conversion in nuclei are potentially amplified , as has been previously discussed @xcite , and the rates for such processes can be within the reach of future experiments .",
    "the reason for this is that while in the sm plus massive neutrinos the amplitudes for lfv violation are proportional to the neutrino masses ( _ i.e. , _ suppressed by the very large right - handed neutrino masses , in the case of the seesaw mechanism ) , in susy models these processes are only suppressed by inverse powers of the supersymmetry breaking scale , which is at most @xmath7  tev .",
    "another sm extension which naturally accommodates non - zero neutrino masses is susy with r - parity violation ( rpv ) .",
    "r - parity is usually imposed as a global symmetry of the minimal supersymmetric version of the sm ( mssm ) in order to prevent an unacceptably large rate for proton decay .",
    "however , this proves to be somewhat of an overkill , since r - parity conservation implies both baryon number and lepton number conservation , while to stop proton decay only one or the other needs to be exactly conserved . in light of the evidence for neutrino masses , which can potentially be majorana particles and therefore violate lepton number , one may , instead , take advantage of rpv operators to generate small neutrino masses .    in this paper , we consider susy models with rpv but with baryon parity ( in order to satisfy the current experimental upper limits on the proton lifetime  @xcite ) .",
    "these models naturally generate small majorana neutrino masses , if the rpv couplings are small @xcite . in such rpv models ,",
    "`` large '' lfv in the charged lepton sector is also generically expected . indeed , as has been pointed out in the literature @xcite ,",
    "the most stringent limits on certain products of rpv couplings come from the present experimental bounds on charged lfv processes .",
    "therefore it is important to understand some of the general features of lfv in models with rpv .",
    "it is interesting to consider how searches for lfv at low energy experiments compare to those at colliders .",
    "for instance , the similtaneous presence of r - violating operators that couple both to @xmath8 and to @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) pairs , would lead to @xmath11+jet ( @xmath12+jet ) final states at hera @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath13 transitions , the high energy experimental probes provide the strongest bounds , while for @xmath14 transitions stopped muon experiments provide , by far , the most stringent bounds .",
    "finally , the strongest bound for @xmath15 transitions comes from @xmath16 searches at cleo @xcite ( @xmath17 ) which is less restrictive .",
    "in the near future , the experimental sensitivity to some rare muons processes is going to improve by two to three orders of magnitude , while a similar improvement is not expected for other lfv processes .",
    "for this reason , we will focus on processes with stopped muons , which not only provide the stringest quantitative bounds on lfv today , but which will be significantly probed in the near future .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the lfv processes @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 conversion in the case of models with trilinear rpv . in sec .  2",
    ", we briefly introduce the susy models with trilinear rpv which will be considered here . in sec .  3 , we present the formalism for computing branching ratios and asymmetries of the relevant lfv processes . in sec .  4",
    ", we consider lfv processes in some representative cases , including those in which the branching ratio for @xmath21 is much smaller than the branching ratio for @xmath22 and/or the rate for @xmath23 conversion in nuclei , which can be generated at the tree - level . even if all lfv processes occur at the one - loop level , the rates for all three processes considered here are comparable .",
    "these features are completely different from the predictions of other neutrino mass generating susy frameworks , such as the mssm with right - handed neutrinos @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath21 is much larger than that for @xmath22 and the rate for @xmath24 conversion in nuclei , even though all processes are also generated at the one - loop level .",
    "we also show that p - odd asymmetries in the @xmath19 process ( which require polarised muons in order to be measured ) are very useful in order to distinguish different models .",
    "contains our conclusions . in appendix  a we provide explicit expressions for the lfv vertices in the case of models with rpv , while in appendix  b we discuss the current bounds on certain pairs of rpv couplings from lfv processes and comment on neutrino masses .",
    "here , we briefly introduce the susy models with rpv which will be discussed in the upcoming sections .",
    "if r - parity conservation is not postulated , in addition to ordinary yukawa interactions , the following terms are allowed in the mssm superpotential : @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 denote the left - handed doublet lepton , right - handed lepton , left - handed doublet quark , right - handed up - type quark , right - handed down - type quark , and `` up - type '' higgs superfields , respectively .",
    "the indices @xmath32 and @xmath33 range from 1 to 3 for different quark / lepton flavours . throughout this paper , in order to forbid rapid proton decay , we impose baryon parity  @xcite , so all @xmath34 couplings are zero .",
    "we also make the simplifying assumption that all @xmath35 also vanish . were non - zero ,",
    "their contributions to lfv processes would be , in general , negligible because of neutrino mass constraints @xcite . ] in light of these assumptions , the superpotential above yields the following lagrangian : @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) denotes fermions and @xmath40 sfermions , and the index @xmath41 indicates the field s chirality .",
    "we assume that the rpv yukawa couplings above ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) are the only source of lfv . in what follows , eq .",
    "( [ rpvmodel ] ) is what is referred to by `` rpv model . ''",

    "the process @xmath45 is generated by photon penguin diagrams ( see the penguin diagrams in figs .",

    "the couplings @xmath60 arise from the on - shell photon diagrams ( @xmath61 ) , which induce @xmath18 as well as @xmath19 and @xmath20 conversion in nuclei .",
    "explicit expressions for @xmath62 in models with rpv are presented in appendix  a.    in the @xmath18 decay , it has been argued @xcite that a nonzero muon polarisation is useful not only to suppress background processes , but also to distinguish between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the differential branching ratio for @xmath18 is given by @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the muon polarisation and @xmath67 is the angle between the positron momentum and the polarisation direction . here , the branching ratio br@xmath68 and the p - odd asymmetry @xmath69 are @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the fermi constant , and @xmath72 is the fine - structure constant .      in the rpv models , some of the @xmath74 couplings ( @xmath42 ) generate @xmath19 at tree - level ( fig .",

    "the amplitude is given by @xmath100 where the complete expressions for the tree - level contributions @xmath101 in the case of rpv models are presented in appendix  a. the @xmath20 conversion rate is @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the muon capture rate in the nucleus of interest @xcite , @xmath104 and @xmath105 are the proton and neutron numbers , respectively , @xmath106 is the nuclear form factor as a function of the momentum transfer and @xmath107 is the nuclear effective charge @xcite .",
    "in some of the most commonly used nuclei , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , these nuclear parameters are given by @xcite @xmath110 and @xmath111",
    "the most severe constraints on some particular products of trilinear rpv couplings come from the present experimental upper limits on the branching ratios of the lfv processes discussed in the previous section ( see appendix  b ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , searches for lfv in muon processes are particularly sensitive to models with rpv .",
    "generically , it is very hard to make definite predictions for the branching ratios of the lfv processes since the number of new yukawa couplings ( @xmath112 ) is too large .",
    "here we consider , instead , different cases where only a small number of rpv couplings is significant for lfv .",
    "this is done not only to simplify the problem at hand , but also to identify features of lfv which are not only different from those in the `` traditional '' models , such as the mssm with heavy right - handed neutrinos discussed in @xcite , but which can also be used to characterise the different cases themselves .",
    "this dominance of specific rpv couplings is also a consequence of certain flavour models @xcite .",
    "first , we consider a model in which only the yukawa couplings @xmath113 and @xmath114 are non - zero . in this case , @xmath58 is generated at the tree - level , while the other lfv processes ( @xmath115 and @xmath20 conversion in nuclei ) are induced via photon penguin diagrams at the one - loop level , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diagram1 ] .",
    "the effective vertices are given by @xmath116 here we assume , without loss of generality , that the rpv couplings are real .",
    "the function @xmath117 is presented in appendix  a. in @xmath20 conversion , we assume the momentum of the virtual photon to be @xmath118 in order to compute @xmath119 in @xmath120 , while in the case of @xmath19 , we simply set @xmath61 @xmath121 , since the tree - level contribution @xmath122 is much larger than the contribution from @xmath119",
    ". the ratios of branching ratios , @xmath123 and @xmath124 do not depend on the r - parity violating couplings @xmath125 , and only depend on the susy mass spectrum through @xmath126 and @xmath127 : @xmath128 the second of the equal signs being valid for @xmath129 . here",
    "@xmath130(one - loop contr.)/(tree - level contr . ) in the @xmath19 process , which is close to unity ( for example , @xmath131 for @xmath132 ) .",
    "since the @xmath19 process is generated at tree level , its branching ratio is much larger than that of the other lfv processes , as expected .",
    "if such a scenario were realized in nature , the @xmath19 process would dominate over all the other channels , _",
    "i.e. , _ it is very likely that if nature realizes this particular scenario , @xmath19 is within experimental reach while @xmath21 is orders of magnitude below any foreseeable future experiment .",
    "another interesting feature of eqs.([model1_ratio1],[model1_ratio2 ] ) is that , because of an ultraviolet log - enhancement of the off - shell photon penguin contribution ( @xmath120 )  @xcite , the @xmath20 conversion rates are significantly larger than the branching ratio of @xmath133 .",
    "it is important to emphasise that the ratios of branching ratios of the different processes are very different from those in the different neutrino - mass models .",
    "for example , in the mssm with heavy right - handed neutrinos ( and r - parity conservation )  @xcite , the following relations are approximately satisfied , because the on - shell photon penguin contribution @xmath134 tends to dominate over all others : @xmath135    another interesting feature of the case at hand is that in the @xmath44 process we obtain the following p - odd asymmetries ( eqs .",
    "( [ p - odd1]-[p - odd2 ] ) ) : @xmath136 since the tree - level contribution @xmath122 ( @xmath137 ) is dominant .",
    "the key feature here is that the two different p - odd asymmetries have opposite sign ; @xmath138 . more generally , this feature is present whenever the effective vertices @xmath94 are dominant . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we list results of other similar examples .",
    "the situation is clearly different from the mssm with heavy right - handed neutrinos , where the on - shell photon contributions @xmath134 ( @xmath139 ) are dominant ( this case is also listed in table  [ table1 ] , in order to facilitate comparisons ) : @xmath140    ._the ratios of branching ratios @xmath141 and @xmath142 , p - odd asymmetries @xmath69 for @xmath115 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath19 are shown when the listed pair of yukawa couplings is dominant .",
    "case ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) refers to the representative classes of models discussed in secs .",
    "4.1 , 4.2 , and 4,3 , respectively . here , we assume @xmath145  gev and no mixing in the charged slepton mass matrix , and @xmath146  gev .",
    "we also show a typical result obtained for the mssm with heavy right - handed neutrinos and r - parity conservation @xcite . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      in models with trilinear rpv , neutrino masses are generated at one - loop via squark ( slepton ) exchange for @xmath99 ( @xmath74 ) operators . under the assumption that the left - right sfermion soft mass - squared mixing terms are diagonal in the physical basis and proportional to the associated fermion mass ( @xmath147 ) , the formula for the neutrino masses",
    "can be simplified to @xcite @xmath148   \\\\",
    "f(x ) & = & ( x\\ln x - x+1)/(x-1)^2 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath149 is the fermion mass of the @xmath150th generation inside the loop , @xmath151 is the average of the @xmath152 and @xmath153 squark masses , and @xmath154 is a colour factor ( 3 for @xmath99 operators and 1 for @xmath74 operators ) .",
    "this expression implies that the heavier the fermions in the loop , the stricter the bounds @xcite .",
    "for example , demanding @xmath155 ev for sparticle masses of 300 gev , @xmath156  gev and @xmath157 mev , leads to @xmath158 . for @xmath159 the bound drops to @xmath160 @xcite , while for `` super - kamiokande - friendly '' solutions with hierarchical neutrinos the bounds on certain products of rpv couplings can be stricter by some orders of magnitude .",
    "when comparing these bounds with the ones from lfv in tables  [ table2 ] and [ table3 ] , we see that for a large number of models the bounds from stopped muon processes are significantly stronger than those from neutrino masses .",
    "a proper study of these processes therefore , can shed additional light in the issue of lepton number violation .",

    "<S> supersymmetry with r - parity violation ( rpv ) provides an interesting framework for naturally accommodating small neutrino masses . within this framework </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the lepton - flavour violating ( lfv ) processes @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 conversion in nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> we make a detailed study of the observables related to lfv in different rpv models , and compare them to the expectations of r - conserving supersymmetry with heavy right - handed neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the predictions are vastly different and uniquely characterise each model , thus providing a powerful framework for experimentally distinguishing between different theories of lfv . besides the obvious possibility of amplified tree - level generation of @xmath3 and @xmath2 conversion in nuclei , we find that even in the case where these processes arise at the one - loop level , their rates are comparable to that of @xmath4 , in clear contrast to the predictions of r - conserving models . we conclude that in order to distinguish between the different models , such a combined study of _ all _ the lfv processes is necessary , and that measuring p - odd asymmetries in polarised @xmath1 can play a decisive role </S>",
    "<S> . we also comment on the intriguing possibility of rpv models yielding a large t - odd asymmetry in the decay of polarised @xmath5 .    </S>",
