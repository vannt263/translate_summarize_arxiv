    "detailed treatment of pair cascades , e.g. @xcite , in which the vhe @xmath0-ray energy is reprocessed towards somewhat lower values , might help solving this issue .",

    "the efficiency of vhe @xmath0-ray production will peak around periastron , reflecting the higher target photon density .",
    "the high temperature of the companion star means that ic @xmath0-ray production proceeds primarily in the deep klein - nishina regime ( where the ic cross - section is sharply reduced compared to the thompson regime ) . due to changing magnetic field strength and",
    "target photon density along the orbit , the maximum electron energy will be increased by a factor of roughly 10 between periastron and apastron , where the ic cooling becomes less efficient ( for a more detailed discussion , see @xcite ) .",

    "other effects such as angular dependence of ic scattering@xcite could also introduce spectral hardening at apastron phase .      in an accretion disk - jet scenario ,",
    "orbital modulation could arise from modulation of the jet injection rate .",
    "paredes et al@xcite propose a leptonic jet model for ls  5039 , where a slow equatorial stellar wind induces a modulation of accretion rate ( maximum shortly after periastron ) .",
    "an additional stream wind formed next to periastron is required to reproduce the doubled - peak x - ray lightcurve .",
    "their predicted vhe orbital modulation ( fig [ fig : prediction ] , red line ) does not agree well with the observed orbital modulation .",
    "in particular , the enhancement in accretion rate shortly after periastron is not observed .",
    "however , complication arise from the detail treatment of absorption effect , which is this case depends on the assumption of the position of @xmath0-ray production along the jet . in particular ,",
    "emission in the small scale jets would produce a similar absorption pattern as in fig [ fig : prediction ] , blue line .",
    "new observations by hess have established orbital modulation of the vhe @xmath0-ray flux and energy spectrum from the xrb ls  5039 .",
    "the flux vs. orbital phase profile provides the first indication for @xmath0-ray absorption within an astrophysical source , suggesting that a large part of the vhe @xmath0-ray production region lies inside the pair absorption photosphere ( within @xmath1 ) around the massive stellar companion .",
    "however , not all of the observed effects can be explained by absorption alone . a detailed study is now required to fully explain these new observations and understand the complex relationship between @xmath0-ray absorption and production processes within these binary systems .",
