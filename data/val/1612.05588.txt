    "the properties of high density nuclear matter are still not sufficiently understood .",
    "however , in recent years , neutron star ( ns ) observations began to place stronger restrictions @xcite on the equation of state ( eos ) of dense matter and to probe structure and composition of ns cores .",
    "most valuable information into the state of their interiors came from the detections of pulsar glitches via pulsar timing measurements , optical and x - ray observations of cooling and accreting nss and from neutrino emission measurements from proto - neutron stars .",
    "these observations provide evidence for superfluidity in the interiors of nss @xcite .",
    "the first direct evidence @xcite that the ns core should exist in a superfluid state has been reported in the study of the ns in the supernova remnant known as cassiopeia a. it has been measured that cassiopeia a s surface temperature has rapidly decreased from @xmath1 k to @xmath2 k. this pronounced drop in surface temperature can be naturally explained @xcite if one assumes that neutrons have recently become superfluid in the ns core . as the neutrons combine to form cooper pairs , a splash of neutrinos",
    "is emitted accelerating the ns cooling process .",
    "another evidence for a superfluid ns core comes from the observation of pulsar glitches , which are sudden jumps in the ns rotation frequency .",
    "glitches like the ones observed in the crab and velar pulsar can be explained by two main physical mechanism  either they are due to starquakes from the ns core @xcite or crust @xcite or they are caused by the sudden unpinning and displacement of a large number of vortices @xcite in the ns superfluid . in the starquake glitch model @xcite , the glitches are caused by a sudden reduction in the moment of inertia of some solid component of the ns . for example , the differential rotation between the crust and the superfluid ns core can produce stresses @xcite in the ns crust leading to crustquakes .",
    "the resulting crustquakes distort the star s shape and hence generate sudden jumps in the ns rotational frequency , seen as glitches .",
    "in contrast , in the pinned superfluid model angular momentum is suddenly transferred from the superfluid ns core to the non - superfluid crust via vortex unpinning , spinning it up .",
    "neutron superfluid vortices can become pinned to nuclear clusters in the inner crust @xcite or to magnetic flux tubes in the core @xcite .",
    "this prevents angular momentum from being transferred to the ns crust .",
    "hence , a differential rotation builds up between the ns core and crust .",
    "when this differential becomes large enough angular momentum is suddenly transferred from the core to the crust through the catastrophic unpinning of vortices , resulting in a sudden spin - up in the ns .",
    "furthermore , the observed long time relaxation after glitches can be explained only by assuming the coexistence of normal and superfluid components @xcite .",
    "therefore , understanding the properties of neutron superfluidity and the formation and dynamics of superfluid vortices can give us further insights into the evolution of nss and their composition .",
    "at the high density central part of nss the neutron superfluidity is attributed to the @xmath3 pairing interaction @xcite rather than to @xmath4 pairing familiar from the conventional bcs theory of superconductors .",

    "( this is also known from spin-2 spinor bose - einstein condensates , see refs .",
    "this degeneracy is lifted and the uniaxial nematic phase becomes the unique ground state once the sixth order term is taken into account .",
    "the ground states in the presence of a magnetic field were recently determined @xcite ; the ground state is in the uniaxial nematic phase for smaller magnetic fields relevant for ordinary nss and in the @xmath8- or @xmath9-biaxial nematic phase for large magnetic field relevant for magnetars . beyond the gl theory , the ground states in the @xmath10 phase diagram have been obtained recently in the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) formalism @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8- and @xmath9-biaxial nematic phases appear in lower @xmath11 and @xmath12 region and in higher @xmath11 and @xmath12 region , respectively .",
    "the phase boundary is of second order at higher temperature while it is of first order at lower temperature , and a tricritical point connects these boundaries .",
    "one of the most important results of the bdg formalism is that @xmath0 superfluids were found to be topological superfluids predicting gapless majorana fermions on the surface @xcite .",
