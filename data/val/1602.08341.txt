    "since ancient times , people have struggled with how best to draw a map .",
    "the dawn of the age of discovery and its great seafaring voyages brought with it an urgent growth in cartographic investigation and prompted the development of differential and projective geometry .",
    "but it has been long recognized that all maps distort certain surface features , so that the question of which map to use is answered by which features one wants to represent and in which manner they should be represented .",
    "conformal maps such as the mercator projection , prominent for use in navigation at sea , locally preserve angles and shapes at the expense of distorted areas - making greenland look bigger than africa and south america .",
    "other typical map projections preserve areas or distances between two points at the expense of distortions in other features .",
    "there are an infinite number of possible map projections , an infinite number that function as a compromise between distortions in two desired features , and an infinite number that do not preserve any particular feature .",
    "gauss theorema egregium of 1828 illuminated the reason behind the inability to find a distortionless map , showing that any map between surfaces of different curvature will always introduce distortions .    in more recent times",
    ", there has been an interest in mimicking certain aspects of gravitating systems in laboratory settings .",
    "for example , similarities between the space - time metric and the navier - stokes equations for a flowing fluid show that a sonic or surface wave horizon in the flowing fluid could provide an experimentally accessible surrogate for the study of near - horizon relativistic effects including hawking radiation @xcite .    light propagation through dielectric media is another system that could serve as such an analog space - time .",
    "the connection between light propagation in gravitational systems and light propagation in dielectric media was recognized in the early days of general relativity when it was observed that the relativistic deflection of starlight by a massive object such as the sun could instead be explained by an appropriate distribution of refractive media around the object @xcite .",
    "it was subsequently shown by gordon that the correspondence also holds in the other direction ; that light propagation in certain refracting media can instead be mathematically described as light propagation through a curved vacuum space - time with an `` optical metric '' that is determined by the optical properties of the medium @xcite .",
    "later , plebanski identified the effective permittivity and permeability of an arbitrary space - time metric @xcite , and these results were used by de felice to describe a dielectric representation of schwarzschild space - time , arguably the first definite description of an analog black hole @xcite . in the last decade , developments in metamaterials @xcite have opened the possibility of physically realizing artificial media possessing some of the unusual dielectric properties required to construct a dielectric analog space - time and has sparked a resurgence of interest in the subject @xcite .",
    "dielectric analog space - times are obtained as a projection of a curved vacuum manifold into a dielectric medium residing in a space - time of different curvature , usually flat minkowski space - time , in very much the same manner that earth s curved surface is cartographically projected onto a flat plane .",
    "gauss theorema egregium applies equally to this modern concept of space - time map making ; consequently , any dielectric analog space - time must necessarily introduce distortions into its representation of light propagation through the vacuum .",
    "this fact seems to be underappreciated in much of the literature , which has largely focused on the form of the optical metric and the coordinate description of optical rays through the analog .",
    "the majority of investigations in the subject have followed the footsteps of plebanski and de felice in identifying the dielectric properties of the analog and the optical metric with the vacuum metric , an identification that could mislead to the assumption that light propagation through the analog faithfully emulates the behavior of light propagating through the vacuum .    by analyzing the kinematics of a congruence of light in the analog ,",
    "we show that the plebanski analog fails to emulate physically measurable characteristics such as the fractional rate of expansion of a transverse cross section of the congruence .",
    "thus the plebanski choice of projection map is actually quite similar to the mercator projection in that it preserves the coordinate description of a ray but introduces distortions into the evolution of the cross - sectional area of a congruence . as with cartography ,",
    "there are an unlimited number of analog projections , and a more general mapping of vacuum space - times into analog representations was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . using this ,",
    "we demonstrate how an expansion - preserving projection map may be constructed , such that the expansion of a congruence is faithfully represented in the analog at the expense of distortions to the optical metric and the coordinate path of light rays .",
    "we also provide a more detailed analysis of the covariance properties of dielectric analog space - times and show that the analog system lacks covariance in the sense that two analogs representing two different coordinate descriptions of the vacuum space - time are not themselves related by the same , or even an associated , coordinate transformation .    furthermore , plebanski s identification of a space - time metric with effective dielectric properties has been widely adopted as a basis for the interpretation of transformation optics ( to ) @xcite , and to has been correspondingly invoked to undertake studies in analog space - times .",
    "we argue that while dielectric analog space - times and to are indeed very closely related , there are subtle differences that make the analog space - times approach unsuitable as a rigorous foundation for transformation optics . aside from conceptual issues , there are three problems with using analog space - times as the basis for to .",
    "first , the lack of any unique or canonical projection from the vacuum to the analog makes this approach to to ill - defined .",
    "second , any useful formulation of to should be fully covariant , while analog space - times suffer from covariance issues .",
    "third , the fact that no analog projection can faithfully replicate all aspects of light propagation in the vacuum means that the to analog simply does not function as expected .",

    "[ fig : commdiagram ] commutative , @xmath24 and @xmath71 will represent the same physical analog medium .",
    "however , the coordinates in the analog are still completely independent of the coordinates in @xmath41 .",
    "one could choose @xmath85 and we see that the action of @xmath74 is simply to undo the coordinate transformation @xmath73 , which returns us to the original configuration in the original analog coordinates .",
    "since the projection is freely specifiable , @xmath41 may be represented by an infinite number of physically inequivalent analog media in minkowski space - time .",
    "the projection into the analog is not unique and there does not exist a canonical choice of @xmath52 . indeed , as we have seen , a single choice of @xmath52 is not even possible if one wants different coordinate descriptions of a vacuum manifold to have the same physical analog representation .",
    "however , this wide freedom in the choice of @xmath52 also implies that the analog model only has meaning when interpreted with respect to the chosen map .",
    "furthermore , since a curved vacuum space - time can not be isometrically mapped into a minkowskian analog , not all features of light propagation in the curved manifold can be simultaneously emulated by the analog . in subsequent sections",
    "it is shown that the choice of projection map should be informed by which feature of light propagation one wishes to emulate .      to illustrate the physical inequivalence of analogs obtained using @xmath61 with different coordinate descriptions of the same space - time , we consider flrw space - time in conformal , comoving , and physical coordinates , and find that the corresponding analogs are not related by a coordinate transformation .",
    "friedmann - lamatre - robertson - walker space - time is often described by comoving coordinates @xmath62 with the line element @xmath86 in this form it may be seen that a spatial hypersurface of the flrw space - time expands or contracts with time through the scale factor @xmath87 and may be used to model an expanding or contracting universe . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : trivialanalog ] ) , and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : g = starfcompon])-([eq : material ] ) , the corresponding trivial dielectric analog of flrw space - time in comoving coordinates is given by    [ eq : comovmat ] @xmath88    thus for this coordinate representation , the analog model is an isotropic but time - dependent medium .    alternatively , flrw is actually a conformally rescaled form of minkowski space - time . defining the conformal time @xmath89 the flrw space - time now has the line element @xmath90 and we find that the resulting analog is just empty minkowski space - time    [ eq : confmat ] @xmath91    this result highlights an important feature of dielectric analog space - times in that ,",
    "as far as the light cone is concerned , a dielectric analog actually represents an equivalence class of conformally related space - times .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath25 operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi - general ] ) are conformally invariant and so @xmath24 is also conformally invariant .",
    "thus given a coordinate description that is conformally related to minkowski space - time we should not be surprised that the analog is just minkowski space - time .    in the comoving",
    "coordinates introduced above , a spatial hypersurface is seen to expand even though the spatial coordinate points themselves remain fixed .",
    "this implies that the physical distance between two points of fixed comoving coordinates is actually increasing [ or decreasing depending on @xmath87 ] with time .",
    "the physical distance to an object at fixed comoving coordinate is @xmath93 an observer would naturally interpret the behavior of objects at fixed comoving coordinates as moving away from each other with recessional velocities that are proportional to their distance - a rule known as hubble s law .",
    "this hubble flow may be conveniently described by the physical coordinates @xmath63 with line element @xmath94 the same procedure as used before gives the physical coordinates analog as    [ eq : physmat ] @xmath95    which is a complicated anisotropic magnetoelectric medium .    in each of these cases ,",
    "the target manifold has been specified as minkowski space - time with spherical coordinates .",
    "it is therefore clear that plebanski s approach with analog projection map @xmath61 results in different physical analog models for different coordinate descriptions of the same vacuum space - time .",
    "from the time of eddington @xcite and gordon @xcite , through plebanski @xcite and to the present , the study of dielectric analog space - times has been largely focused on coordinate descriptions of the geometric optics ray trajectories of light through the analog , and it appears to have been widely assumed that this coordinate description suffices as a faithful representation of light propagation through the curved space - time @xmath41 .",
    "however , a coordinate description of ray trajectories in the analog is of limited value because the coordinates in @xmath41 and the analog coordinates refer to different metrics .",
    "so even if rays in the analog pass through points with the same coordinate labels as rays in @xmath41 , they can not simultaneously replicate all kinematical aspects of light propagation in @xmath41 , such as the fractional expansion , shear , and vorticity of a congruence ; quantities that carry characteristic information about the space - time .",
    "for example , the fractional expansion of a null congruence tells us about the presence of singularities , trapped surfaces , and horizons , and so would need to be properly analyzed for any analog that claimed to replicate such features .",
    "in fact , it turns out that the ability of an analog model to faithfully emulate these characteristic features is quite limited .",
    "we focus on the fractional expansion of a congruence of light rays in the analog , and find that while a projection may be found such that the expansion of a congruence in the analog matches the expansion of a congruence in @xmath41 , the required map is specific to the chosen congruence ; any other congruence in the analog will fail to have the correct expansion .",
    "the discussion of light rays falls within the realm of geometric optics .",
    "to arrive at the geometric optics limit in the analog , one may begin by assuming a solution for the 4-vector potential @xmath96 and @xmath97 . inserting this into maxwell s equations ( [ eq : hom ] ) and",

    "thus , in media the tensor @xmath115 is often referred to as the `` optical metric , '' but should be understood as containing information on both the medium parameters and background metric . since @xmath117 is a function on the cotangent bundle that vanishes everywhere on a solution curve , then the exterior derivative of @xmath108 also vanishes , @xmath118 , leading to hamilton s canonical equations @xmath119 which may be integrated to find the ray trajectories .      before showing the failure of the analog",

    "despite the fact that the projection @xmath61 results in an optical metric @xmath142 , light propagation in the analog does not faithfully replicate all aspects of light propagation in the vacuum .",
    "the reason is that although the optical metric is identical to the vacuum metric , most physical measures of light propagation in the analog are actually made with respect to the background minkowski metric , such as the kinematical decomposition of a congruence .",
    "this decomposition provides physically meaningful measures such as the fractional rate of expansion of the cross section of a laser beam , and in curved space - times is instrumental in determining the existence of trapped surfaces and horizons . as such ,",
    "we focus on the fractional rate of expansion of a radial congruence of light propagating through the analog , and find that projecting with @xmath61 does not reproduce the vacuum rate of expansion .",
    "furthermore , we find that although it is possible to construct a projection tailored such that the expansion is preserved , it can only be preserved for a single choice of congruence at a time .",
    "preserving the expansion for a different choice of congruence requires a different projection .      before analyzing the expansion of a congruence in the analog , we first find the expansion in the vacuum space - time that we are attempting to emulate",
    "we again consider future - directed radially propagating rays . in the vacuum , these rays are null geodesics for which @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "it may be shown that the evolution of a congruence centered on the curve @xmath145 is governed by @xmath146 @xcite .",
    "the expansion is the fractional rate of change of the transverse cross section of the congruence , which is equal to the trace of the projection of @xmath146 into the transverse subspace .",
    "the light cone at every point is spanned by both outgoing and ingoing rays , meaning that the transverse subspace is only two dimensional .",

    "the expansion of the vacuum congruence about @xmath145 is @xmath150 from which we find the expansion of radially outgoing and ingoing rays to be , respectively ,    [ eq : expansion - null - general - frw ] @xmath151      by contrast , we have said that rays in the analog follow nongeodesic time - like curves with respect to the background metric , so it is tempting to examine the kinematics of light in media with the formalism for time - like congruences @xcite .",
    "however , with the advent of metamaterials that offer a great degree of control over light propagation , we find the need for an analysis that can track a congruence that smoothly varies from null to time - like , and even to space - like . the light cone at every point is still defined by a set of two linearly independent rays - left / right or ingoing / outgoing rays .",
    "thus the transverse subspace is still two dimensional , as would be expected for say , the cross section of a laser beam .",
    "the projection operator defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:2-metric - null ] ) made use of the fact that @xmath152 in the vacuum , a relation that does not hold in the analog .",
    "it is therefore necessary to be cognizant of index placement in the analog , and to construct a more general projection operator .",
    "it was previously mentioned that @xmath108 could be considered as a second - order polynomial in @xmath125 .",
    "thus at every point we actually have two solutions , corresponding to ingoing and outgoing rays .",
    "let the pairs @xmath153 and @xmath154 denote the tangent vector and wave covector for outgoing and ingoing rays , respectively , which satisfy    [ eq : conditions - on - the - pairs ] @xmath155    with these fields , the projection operator generalizes to @xcite @xmath156 one may readily verify that @xmath157 , and also that @xmath158 .",
    "since @xmath159 is orthogonal to both @xmath160 and @xmath161 the transverse subspace is still only two dimensional , which is confirmed by the trace @xmath162 .",
    "this construction of @xmath159 follows directly from maxwell s equations in media and is equally applicable to congruences that are null , time - like , or space - like with respect to the background metric .    using this projection operator to calculate the transverse fractional expansion of a congruence in the analog with @xmath163 and @xmath164 as in eq .",

    "we have found that an analog model based on @xmath61 fails to correctly mimic the fractional rate of expansion of the congruence despite the fact that the optical metric and the coordinate description of light curves are the same as in the original space - time .",
    "since the projection is freely specifiable , it is natural to ask whether a different choice of projection could reproduce the correct expansion rate at the expense of the optical metric and coordinate description of curves .    the quantity @xmath166 governs the evolution of the separation between the curve with tangent @xmath163 and a nearby curve in the congruence @xcite .",
    "let @xmath167 be the projection of @xmath168 into the transverse subspace , thereby describing the purely transverse evolution of the congruence .",
    "the fractional expansion is the trace of @xmath169 , so by calculating @xmath169 in both the vacuum and the analog we may find a condition that determines an expansion - preserving projection .",

    "however , by gauss theorema egregium such a map can not exist because the curved space - time @xmath41 and the flat minkowski background of the analog are not isometric .",
    "therefore , we have found that a single map can not satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint - on - the - analog ] ) for all congruences .",
    "the best one can hope for is to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint - on - the - analog ] ) for a given choice of congruence .    as an example , we seek the map that will preserve the expansion of the radially outgoing congruence with tangent vector given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : v - analog - new ] ) , e.g.    [ eq : arbitrary - congruence ] @xmath192    given the symmetries of the space - time and the congruence , we suspect that the desired projection from flrw to the analog has the form @xmath193 with the associated jacobian @xmath194 since @xmath195 we denote both by @xmath134 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : constraint - on - the - analog ] ) provides the differential equation @xmath196 which has the solution @xmath197 where @xmath198 is an integration constant .",
    "thus , for the particular choice of congruence made above we have found an expansion - preserving map . for any other choice of congruence we would have to go through the same procedure , for which the outcome would be the specification of a totally different analog projection map .",
    "one of the pioneering formulations of transformation optics was based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : plebanskiepsilon ] ) and ( [ eq : magnetoelectric ] ) ; in other words , on plebanski s analog space - times model using @xmath61 as the projection @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that , while closely related , analog space - times are not the same thing as to .",
    "the typical explanation of to is that one starts in minkowski space - time and performs a coordinate transformation which results in a new metric describing a curved space - time ; this curved space - time metric is then matched to a dielectric medium via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : plebanskiepsilon ] ) and ( [ eq : magnetoelectric ] ) .",
    "this explanation is problematic because the space - time curvature is a diffeomorphism invariant , so it is not possible to use a coordinate transformation to generate a curved space - time and associated metric .",
    "one could instead argue that the mechanism being employed is a map into a curved space - time that has the desired properties , and a subsequent projection into an analog medium .",
    "such an argument actually bypasses the initial coordinate transformation because it implies that there exist curved vacuum manifolds that possess all possible variations of light propagation , and it is merely a matter of identifying the desired vacuum manifold and projecting to an analog .",
    "but we have just shown that analog space - times suffer from three serious issues that make them a poor choice as the basis for to .    1 .",
    "there is no canonical choice of projection map , so any formulation of to based on this approach is not unique . 2 .",
    "analog space - times are not covariant under coordinate transformations , while any useful formulation of to should be covariant .",
    "most concerningly , analog space - times do not fully replicate the behavior of light propagation in the vacuum .",
    "thus any _ transformation medium _ obtained as the analog of a space - time with the desired light propagation would simply fail to work as expected .    .",
    "an initial distribution of electromagnetic fields on @xmath2 are transformed by the pullback of @xmath199 , and only have support in @xmath200 . ]    instead , it has been shown that a more consistent and fully covariant formulation of to can be obtained through what has been termed a _ corporeal transformation _",
    "@xcite @xmath201 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : to ] .",
    "the key difference is that we begin and end in the same space - time manifold rather than projecting from one manifold to a different manifold .",
    "the dielectric medium @xmath202 can be solved for in exactly the same manner as finding an analog space - time , but eq .  ( [ eq : chi - general ] ) becomes instead @xmath203 where the only change is that everything refers to the same coordinate system on the same manifold @xmath2 .",
    "physically this makes more sense . for all intents and purposes we can not engineer the space - time ; instead , the space - time remains fixed and we simply introduce the presence of dielectric media to manipulate the fields , an operation described by the corporeal transformation .",
    "the corporeal transformation is also not a coordinate transformation since the introduction of media should not have anything to do with coordinates ; thus this basis for to is fully covariant under coordinate transformations @xcite .",
    "this formulation resolves the three major issues enumerated above .",
    "first , since there is no additional projection map involved , the transformation medium is unique for a given corporeal transformation .",
    "second , this formulation of to is fully covariant under coordinate transformations , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tocommdiagram ]",
    ".     in the vacuum configuration corresponds to the same coordinate transformation in the transformation media @xmath24 .",
    "thus to is fully covariant under coordinate transformations . ]    in particular , given a coordinate transformation @xmath73 with jacobian matrix @xmath69 in the vacuum , the corporeal transformation @xmath204 , metric , and hodge dual can all be reexpressed in the new coordinates as @xmath205 , @xmath206 , and @xmath207 , and it follows that @xmath208 so unlike the case for analog space - times , a coordinate change in the initial to vacuum corresponds to the same coordinate change in the transformation medium .",
    "third , since to only refers to a single space - time there is no question about which metric kinematical aspects of light propagation are referred to . the kinematics of a congruence in the transformation medium follows exactly from the corporeal transformation and is not compromised by an intermediary step in a nonphysical curved space - time .",
    "two final remarks about the formulation of to discussed here are that the initial configuration need not be vacuum @xcite , and that it allows one to do to in curved space - times , not just in minkowski space - time @xcite .",
    "by examining the kinematical properties of dielectric analog space - times , we have shown that the projection of a curved space - time @xmath41 into a dielectric analog residing in a space - time of different curvature , such as minkowski space - time , is limited in its ability to faithfully represent all aspects of light propagation in @xmath41 .",
    "this is reminiscent of the challenge faced by cartographers when representing a curved surface on a flat sheet , and follows directly from gauss theorema egregium which forbids distortion - free mappings between nonisometric spaces .",
    "although such mappings are well defined , with tensorial field quantities mapped with well - defined differential geometry operations , analog space - times are found to be noncovariant under coordinate transformation in the sense that the analog model is coordinate dependent .",
    "two analogs representing two different coordinate descriptions of the same space - time are not necessarily the same physical device described in concomitantly related coordinates .",
    "relying solely on the plebanski model of coordinate identification projection @xmath61 would result in two completely different physical devices representing the same space - time .",
    "this helps to highlight the fact that there is no canonical choice of projection map @xmath52 ; an infinite number of projections are possible , and which projection one chooses to employ must be guided by which features of vacuum light propagation one wishes to exhibit in the analog .",
    "this is nicely illustrated by looking at an analog of flrw in different guises .",
    "it was found that plebanski s model of flrw could reproduce some notion of the particle horizon and redshift , but completely failed to adequately represent the kinematical properties of a congruence of light rays , in particular the expansion of a transverse cross section of the congruence .",
    "it is possible to construct a projection map @xmath52 such that the expansion is preserved for a given choice of congruence at the expense of distortions in the optical metric and coordinate description of light rays , but not for all congruences simultaneously .",
    "last , the lack of canonical choice of projection , issues with covariance under coordinate transformations , and the simple fact that the analog does not fully represent light propagation in the vacuum , all cast doubt on the viability of the dielectric analog space - times approach as a basis for transformation optics . instead",
    ", these issues can be simultaneously resolved by simply assuming that to is formulated entirely as corporeal transformations on a single manifold .",
    "such transformations do not touch the metric or the coordinates and only act to actively modify fields ; these have a straightforward interpretation as the insertion of a field - modifying medium .",
