    "the state - of - the - art material engineering and nano - fabrication techniques have made it possible to realize advanced semiconductor devices at atomic scales , such as quantum dots in which the electron motion along all directions is quantized and conducting electrons are confined within the nanometer distances .",
    "in such a system , few electrons are confined within a point - like structure so that it can behave as an artificial atom and , consequently , be used as electronic and optical devices such as memory chip @xcite , quantum computer @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , quantum - dot laser @xcite , etc . in recent years , the electronic , transport , optical and optoelectronic properties of spin - degenerate quantum dots have been intensively investigated .    on the other hand ,",
    "the progress made in realizing spin polarized electronic systems on the basis of diluted magnetic semiconductors and narrow - gap semiconductor nanostructures has opened up a field of spin - electronics ( or spintronics ) . as has been pointed out in a good review edited by wolf and awaschalom @xcite , due to unique nature of the soi in electronic materials ,",
    "quantum transport of electrons in a spin polarized system differs fundamentally from that in a spin - degenerate device .",
    "thus , the spin - dependent effects can offer new mechanisms and schemes for information storage and for increasing the speed of data processing . as a result , the electronic devices , such as spin - transistor @xcite , spin - waveguide @xcite , spin - filter @xcite , etc .",
    ", have been proposed . moreover , optical methods for injection , modulation and detection of spin polarized electrons will eventually become the target for the development of spin polarized nano - optoelectronic devices . at present ,",
    "one of the major challenges for the application of the spintronic systems as working devices is to optimize the spin life times of the carriers in the devices .",
    "it has been realized that in contrast to the diluted magnetic semiconductors in which the soi is induced by the presence of an external magnetic field , spin splitting of carriers can be achieved in narrow - gap semiconductor nanostructures even in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "experimental data have indicated that in narrow - gap semiconductor based quantum wells , such as in inalas / ingaas heterostructures , the higher - than - usual zero - magnetic - field spin splitting ( or spontaneous spin splitting ) can be realized by the inversion asymmetry of the microscopic confining potential due to the presence of the heterojunction @xcite .",
    "this kind of inversion asymmetry corresponds to an inhomogeneous surface electric field and , hence , this kind of spin - splitting is electrically equivalent to the rashba spin - splitting or rashba effect @xcite . from the fact that ingaas - based quantum dots are normally fabricated using inalas / ingaas heterojunctions",
    ", one would expect that the rashba spin splitting can be observed in these quantum dot systems and spin polarized quantum dots can therefore be achieved .",
    "practically , the spin - split quantum dots can be made from , e.g. , an inalas / ingaas heterostructure with a negative bias applied to the side gate @xcite .",
    "in contrast to a spin - split quantum well structure in which the rashba effect can be easily identified by , e.g. , the magnetotransport experiments via measuring the shubnikov - de hass ( sdh ) oscillations @xcite , the spintronic effects in a quantum dot can not be easily observed using conventional transport measurements . normally , optical measurements , such as optical absorption and transmission @xcite , cyclotron - resonance @xcite , etc .",
    ", can be used to determine the energy spectrum of a quantum dot .",
    "although recently there are some theoretical work published regarding the rashba effect in quantum dots in the presence of magnetic fields @xcite , the effect of the soi on energy spectrum of a quantum dot has not yet been fully analyzed .",
    "it should be noted that in ref .  , the soi was taken as a perturbation . in order to understand how soi affects the energy levels of a parabolically confined quantum dot , we feel that more theoretical work is needed and it is the prime motivation of the present work . in this paper",
    ", we present a tractable approach to calculate energy spectrum of an ingaas - based quantum dots with the inclusion of soi induced by the rashba effect .",
    "we would like to examine the important and interesting consequences such as the exchange of the energy states due to soi and the enhancement of the spin polarization by the presence of the magnetic fields .    in section ii the theoretical approach",
    "is developed in calculating the electronic subband structure of a parabolically confined quantum dot in the presence of soi and a magnetic field .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in section iii and the conclusions obtained from this work are summarized in section iv .",
    "the device system under investigation is a typical quantum dot formed on top of a narrow - gap semiconductor heterojunction ( such as an ingaas / inalas - based heterostructure ) grown along the @xmath0-direction , and the lateral confinement is formed in the @xmath1-plane .",
    "a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath2 is applied along the growth - direction of the quantum dot .",
    "we consider the situation where the soi is mainly induced by the presence of the ingaas / inalas heterojunction due to the rashba effect .",
    "in such a case , the lowest order of the soi can be obtained from , e.g. , a @xmath3 band - structure calculation @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that when the soi is induced by the rashba effect due to the presence of the heterojunction and when the magnetic field is applied along the @xmath0-direction , the electronic subband structure along the growth - direction ( or the @xmath0-axis ) depends very little on the soi .",
    "therefore , under the effective - mass approximation , the electronic structure along the @xmath1-plane and in the @xmath0-direction in a quantum dot can be treated separately . including the contribution from soi , the single - electron hamiltonian describing the electronic system in the @xmath1-plane",
    "can be written as    @xmath4_z   + v_c ( r ) , \\label{e1}\\ ] ]    where the zeeman term is neglected for simplicity . here",
    ", @xmath5 is the electron effective mass in the @xmath1-plane , @xmath6 with @xmath7 is the momentum operator , @xmath8 is the vector potential induced by the magnetic field which is taken in the symmetric gauge here for convenience , and @xmath9 is the confining potential of the quantum dot along the @xmath1-plane with @xmath10 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath11 is the rashba parameter which measures the strength of the soi . due to the pauli spin matrices",
    "@xmath12 , this hamiltonian is a @xmath13 matrix . after rewriting this hamiltonian in the cylindrical polar coordinate , we find that the solution of the corresponding schrdinger equation is in the form of @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a good quantum number and @xmath16 is an azimuthal angle to the @xmath17-axis .",
    "thus , the eigenfunction @xmath18 and eigenvalue @xmath19 of the system can be determined by solving @xmath20 \\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\psi_1(r ) \\\\",

    ", we therefore attempt a tractable approach to solve the problem .    for the case of a parabolically confined quantum dot , we have the confining potential @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the characteristic frequency of the confinement . for convenience ,",

    "we assume that the electron wavefunctions are in the form @xmath39 and @xmath40 with @xmath41 being the associated laguerre polynomial .",
    "thus , introducing @xmath42 into eq .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) and carrying out the normalization , we obtain two coupled equations which determine the energy @xmath19 and the coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xmath45 and @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the energy of a parabolically confined quantum dot in the absence of soi , @xmath48 when @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 and , otherwise , @xmath53 with @xmath54 .",

    "the size effects of the dot are also considered . for weakly and strongly confined dots , we take the typical values of the confining potential as @xmath57 mev and @xmath58 mev , respectively .",
    "the condition of electron number conservation is applied to determine the fermi energy of the system . for demonstration of how electrons occupy to the different energy levels in the presence of soi , we assume there are ten electrons in the dot",
    ". moreover , in the present study the effect of the soi on lifetimes of an electron in different states is not taken into consideration  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the many - body effects induced by coulomb interaction in a quantum dot is a higher order effect to affect the energy spectrum , although the coulomb interaction can result in an exchange enhancement which may affect the results qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "below , we discuss the effect of the soi on energy levels of the low - lying states at zero and non - zero magnetic fields . for convenience of the discussion",

    "magnetic field is applied to a quantum dot , the nature of spin - dependent energy spectrum can become even richer in terms of physics due to the coupling of the magnetic field to the confining potential of the quantum dot and to the potential induced by soi .",
    "it should be noted that in the present study , in order to examine the net contribution to the energy spectrum of a dot from the soi , we have neglected the effects induced by the zeeman splitting . in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we plot the low - lying energy levels as a function of the rashba parameter for different magnetic fields b = 1 t and 3 t , respectively , at a fixed quantum dot confinement @xmath64 1 mev . in the absence of the zeeman splitting , the soi induced by the rashba effect at finite magnetic field can lift the magnetic degeneracy of electrons .",
    "namely , the states with the @xmath65 number can have different energies .",
    "we find that in this situation , the occupancy of electrons to different states has some unique features . on one hand",
    ", the presence of the magnetic field can increase the energy gaps among the states with the quantum number @xmath66 .",
    "thus , similar to a strongly confined dot , the magnetic field may increase the critical value @xmath67 above which the system is fully spin - polarized .",
    "this effect can be seen at a relatively low - b - field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) where @xmath68 ev@xmath56 m is found . on the other hand , when the magnetic field predominates the electronic energy spectra , the energy states with the negative magnetic quantum number @xmath15 and the spin - down branches are more preferable for an electron to stay . as a result",
    ", the presence of a b - field can increase the spin - polarization of a quantum dot .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in the presence of a higher magnetic field ( see fig .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , we note that the presence of the magnetic field can result in a lower value of @xmath67 and , consequently , the stronger spin - polarization can be achieved in a dot in the presence of the soi and of a magnetic field .     at b=3 t and @xmath71=1 mev . in the lower panel ,",
    "the @xmath72 states are assembled in different groups and the dashed line refers to the energy of the @xmath73 level .",

    "[ fig3 ] , we show the spectra of low - lying states as a function of the magnetic field at a fixed rashba parameter @xmath75 ev@xmath56 m for a weakly confined dot @xmath76 mev .",
    "we find that in such a case , because @xmath11 is relatively small , the electronic subband energy in the high - b field regime is mainly determined by the strength of the magnetic field through @xmath77 .",
    "the energy spectra at low - b fields differ slightly from this dependence ( see the insert in fig . [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thus , similar to a spin - degenerate quantum dot , in the high - b field regime the energy of a state @xmath78 increases with b field and levels with positive magnetic quantum number @xmath79 are always higher than those with negative @xmath51 .",

    "in this paper , we have examined how the rashba soi affects the energy levels of a parabolically confined quantum dot .",
    "a non - perturbative approach to deal with soi in a quantum dot has been developed .",
    "the main theoretical results obtained from this study are summarized as follows .    in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field",
    ", we enter a regime with different competing energies , where magnetic potential , confining potential of the dot and potential induced by the soi are coupled . as a result",
    ", the presence of the magnetic field can result in much richer features of the spintronic properties in a quantum dot .",
    "the energy spectra and the value of @xmath67 in a dot depend strongly on the strength of the magnetic field . in different b - field regimes ,",
    "the energy levels of spin - modified states have different dependence of the magnetic field .",
    "we have found that a coefficient @xmath97 with @xmath98 plays a role in switching the soi . when @xmath99 a strong effect of the soi on energy levels can be observed , whereas the effects of soi can be neglected when @xmath100 .",
    "thus , ( 1 ) the strong spin polarization can be achieved in a weakly confined dot at zero and non - zero magnetic fields ; ( 2 ) the characteristics of the fock - darwin scheme and the landau type levels are revealed when the magnetic field is strong enough ; and ( 3 ) the effective soi in the system decreases with increasing magnetic field and confining potential of the dot .",
    "on the basis that the energy levels in spin - degenerate quantum dot systems have been well studied using optical and optoelectronic measurements , we believe these experimental techniques can also be used to examine the energy spectra of a quantum dot with soi .",
    "we therefore hope that the theoretical results obtained in this study can be verified experimentally .",
    "although the present work deals with single - particle properties of a quantum dot in the presence of soi , some many - body effects induced by coulomb interaction can be investigated on the basis of these results .",
    "for example , using the energy spectrum and wavefunction obtained from this study , we can calculate the collective excitation modes and fast - electron optical spectrum using , e.g. , a random - phase approximation  @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of a spin - split quantum dot , these further studies require numerical calculations considerably and we therefore do not attempt them in the present work .",
