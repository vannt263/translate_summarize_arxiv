    "in 1935 specht @xcite constructed irreducible representations of @xmath0 as spaces spanned by certain polynomials , with @xmath0 acting by permuting the variables . in his construction , very special role is played by _ standard young tableaux _ - a combinatorial object labeling a basis of the irreducible representations .",
    "standard young tableaux proved itself to be an extremely useful tool in studying the representation theory of @xmath0 .",
    "desarmenien , kung and rota were studying a characteristic - free approach to invariant theory .",
    "they developed a straightening formula which allowed to decompose an arbitrary bideterminant of given content into linear combination of standard bideterminants , see @xcite for details .",
    "the standard bideterminants are labeled by pairs of generalized standard young tableaux .",
    "the standard monomial theory was discovered by hodge and young , and later was greatly developed by lakshmibai with coauthors , see @xcite for a survey . among other things ,",
    "the theory describes a basis for the coordinate ring of the grassmanian .",
    "the basis elements of the coordinate ring are called standard monomials , and the objects labeling standard monomials are very similar in spirit to standard young tableaux .    in his doctoral thesis @xcite published in 1901",
    "issai schur determined the irreducible polynomial representations of @xmath1 .",
    "these are labeled by partitions @xmath2 with at most @xmath3 parts . moreover ,",
    "a basis for such a representation can be labeled by semi - standard young tableaux of shape @xmath2 . in @xcite green",
    "describes a construction of such a basis using the bideterminants from @xcite , following the works of deruyts @xcite and clausen @xcite .",
    "a common theme of the results mentioned above is the labeling of certain basis by some _ standard _ objects . in this paper",
    "we view an object a standard if it is _ non - nesting_. in combinatorics there is a well - known duality between non - nesting and non - crossing objects ; see for example @xcite .",
    "this duality suggests that there might be non - crossing counterparts of the standard bases .",
    "we construct such counterparts .",
    "the paper goes as follows . in section [ nct ]",
    "we review the construction of specht modules .",
    "then we define non - crossing tableaux which will be the key object in the paper",
    ". then we study properties of non - crossing tableaux .",
    "in particular , we show that they provide a natural labeling for a basis of the irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "we also show that semi - non - crossing tableaux can be naturally defined , by analogy with semi - standard young tableaux .",
    "the semi - noncrossing tableaux play an important role in further sections .",
    "finally , we show a curious connection with the temperley - lieb algebra in the case of two - row tableaux . in section [ sec : bi ] we provide a background on standard bitableaux of rota et.al .",
    "then we define non - crossing bitableaux and show that they possess the basis property . in section [ sec",
    ": mon ] we start with a brief review of standard monomial theory .",
    "we proceed by defining non - crossing monomials and showing that they do form a basis for the coordinate ring of the grassmannian .",
    "then we pose the question whether non - crossing monomials can be realised as non - initial monomials under some monomial order .",
    "we answer the question affirmatively in case of @xmath4 . in section [ gl ]",
    "we describe a basis labeled by nct for irreducible representations of @xmath5 . finally , in section [ goodbye ] some concluding remarks are made .",
    "the following description of specht s construction is taken from @xcite .",
    "let @xmath6 be a partition . recall that a young diagram is the corresponding shape made out of unit squares .",
    "a filling of these squares with numbers from @xmath7 to @xmath3 is called a _ tableau_.",
    "if additionally numbers are increasing along rows and columns , then we call such tableau _ a standard young tableau _ , or just syt .",
    "let @xmath8 be a tableau of shape @xmath2 .",
    "associate to it a polynomial @xmath9 where @xmath10 means that @xmath11 is above @xmath12 in a column of @xmath8 .",
    "let the symmetric group @xmath0 act on the set of such @xmath13 according to the rule @xmath14 , where @xmath0 acts on tableaux by permuting the numbers in the filling .",
    "let @xmath15 be the @xmath0-module spanned by @xmath13-s , as @xmath8 runs through all possible tableaux of shape @xmath2 ; we denote this set by @xmath16 .    [ theorem  1.6.27 , theorem  1.6.29 , @xcite ] as @xmath2 runs through partitions of @xmath3 , @xmath15-s form a complete set of irreducible representations of @xmath0 . as @xmath8 runs through syt - s of shape @xmath2 , @xmath13-s form a basis for @xmath15",
    ".    there exists a way of expressing any @xmath13 in terms of polynomials corresponding to syt .",
    "it is achieved through repeated application of _ garnir relations _ defined as follows . for two columns @xmath17 and @xmath18 , find the smallest @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the group of permutations of @xmath22 , and let the @xmath23 be the subgroup of @xmath21 which is a product of subgroups permuting @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "in particular , given a shape @xmath6 , consider a rectangular shape @xmath28 which contains @xmath2 . unless specified otherwise , @xmath28 is going to be the smallest such shape .",
    "now fix a particular filling @xmath29 of @xmath30 with numbers @xmath31 in which numbers increase along rows and columns .",
    "thus , any syt @xmath8 of shape @xmath2 can be completed with @xmath29 to become a syt @xmath32 of shape @xmath28 .",
    "we denote the set of such resulting syt - s by @xmath33 .",
    "observe that @xmath34 via its natural embedding into @xmath35 acts on @xmath33 , inducing the action of @xmath0 on the module generated by @xmath13 , @xmath36 .",
    "denote this module by @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath0-modules @xmath37 and @xmath15 are isomorphic , with an isomorphism given by @xmath38 .",
    "one can see that the garnir relations which hold for @xmath13-s also hold for @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 is a quotient of @xmath15 .",
    "however , since @xmath15 is irreducible this implies that they are in fact equal .",
    "an alternative way to view @xmath37 is the following : @xmath37 is the quotient of @xmath40 by relations @xmath41 for all @xmath8 which do not agree with @xmath29 .",
    "as was pointed out to the author by arun ram , this theorem follows from the results of garsia and wachs , @xcite . in their terminology ,",
    "splitting of @xmath28 into @xmath2 and @xmath30 is an instance of _ segmentation_. it corresponds naturally to the restriction from @xmath35 to the young subgroup @xmath42 . as a result",
    "the irreducible representation of @xmath35 labeled by @xmath28 decomposes into the cross product of the @xmath0-representation @xmath15 and the @xmath43-representation labeled by the skew shape @xmath30 .",
    "thus our choice of the particular filling @xmath29 is just a choice of a particular vector in the letter skew representation .",
    "as we can see , syt provide a natural labeling for a basis of @xmath15 . in the next section",
    "we define an alternative combinatorial object which also provides a natural labeling of a ( different ) basis of @xmath15",
    ".      columns of a tableau @xmath8 of rectangular shape @xmath44 can be viewed as partitions of numbers from @xmath7 to @xmath45 into @xmath46 sets of size @xmath47 each .",
    "let us extend the name tableau to any such partition regardless of particular presentation in terms of filling of some shape . in that case set @xmath33 can be viewed as tableaux which _ agree _ with @xmath29 . by abuse of notation",
    "we are sometimes going to say that elements of @xmath33 have shape @xmath2 ( rather than @xmath28 ) ; it is going to be clear from the context which one is meant .",
    "consider two sets of numbers @xmath48 and @xmath49 of size @xmath47 each .",
    "let @xmath50 and @xmath51 be their increasing rearrangements . call a pair of segments @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 $ ] _ non - crossing",

    "formally , nct are partitions , however the term `` non - crossing partition '' is reserved in the literature for a different notion of `` non - crossing '' .",
    "observe , that in this terminology syt would be called non - nesting tableau . indeed , the condition which holds for columns of syt is that any two columns @xmath48 and @xmath49 are non - nesting .",
    "an example of a syt and nct can be seen on figure [ nct5 ] .",
    "it is possible to get rid of @xmath29 in the definition of nct .",

    "if @xmath64 then @xmath65 fails to hold ; 3 .   if @xmath66 then @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the largest index such that @xmath69",
    "call a tableau non - crossing if its columns are non - crossing ( if we deal with columns of equal length , in the above definition @xmath48 should correspond to the left one ) .    for any @xmath29 the previous definition of nct is equivalent to the restated definition , up to the order of columns of equal length .",
    "one can check that the only influence @xmath29 has on non - crossing condition is setting an unique order on columns of equal length .",
    "thus if the statement of the lemma is true for some @xmath29 , it is true for any such @xmath29 .",
    "start numbering outer corners of our shape from right to left ; when done , do it again for obtained shape , etc .",
    "one can check that the previouse definition of a nct translates into the new definition .",
    "it is convenient to look at tableaux in the following way .",
    "start with a tableau @xmath8 , whose parts are arranged increasingly .",
    "mark @xmath70 points on a line ( where @xmath71 ) , which can be identified with integer points on the segment @xmath72 $ ] . to the point @xmath11",
    "associate a label @xmath73 , such that @xmath11 is the @xmath73-th element in the part of @xmath8 which it belongs to . call such diagram a _ reading _ of @xmath8 , and denote it by @xmath74 . for each part @xmath50 , connect @xmath75 and @xmath76 with an arc , @xmath58 .",
    "then these arcs define @xmath8 uniquely .",
    "here is an example of a nct with a corresponding reading diagram , for one possible choice of labeling of @xmath29 .",
    "one can see that every reading has the yamanuchi property : for all @xmath77 and all @xmath78 , the number of points labeled @xmath79 in @xmath80 $ ] is not less than the number of points labeled @xmath81 in @xmath80 $ ] . on the other hand , to a particular yamanuchi word with @xmath46 @xmath11-s , @xmath82 ( we consider such words further on , unless specified otherwise ) , we can always associate a tableau , possibly in more than one way .",
    "each ( yamanuchi ) reading is a reading of exactly one syt and exactly one nct .",
    "for each @xmath82 , restrict our attention to points labeled @xmath11 and @xmath83 .",
    "there is exactly one way to match them so that the matching is non - crossing . indeed , put parentheses around neighboring pairs @xmath84 .",
    "then delete those labels that already got matched and repeat .",
    "we get a non - crossing matching such that in each pair @xmath11 precedes @xmath12 , and it is unique",
    ".    there is also exactly one way to match them so that the matching is non - nesting .",
    "indeed , match the first @xmath11 with the first @xmath83 , the second @xmath11 with the second @xmath83 , etc .",
    "one can see that the resulting matching is non - nesting and no other non - nesting matching exists in which in each matched pair @xmath11 precedes @xmath83 .",
    "in fact , yamanuchi words in two letters correspond to dyck paths of length @xmath85 , and which can be easily bijected with non - crossing and non - nesting matchings .",
    "now , once we matched the points labelled @xmath11 and @xmath83 for each @xmath11 by drawing corresponding arcs , putting those arcs on one picture produces exactly the needed tableaux .",
    "the uniqueness follows from uniqueness for each @xmath11 .",
    "the illustration of syt and nct corresponding to the same reading is given in figure [ nct5 ] .",
    "[ eq ] the number of nct of shape @xmath2 is equal to the number of syt of shape @xmath2 .    fixing the filling of @xmath29 is equivalent to fixing the labels of the last @xmath86 points of the reading .",
    "thus , both syt and nct of shape @xmath2 correspond to all possible yamanuchi words with this particular ending .",
    "this correspondance actually provides a bijection from one set of tableaux to the other .",
    "it is a tradition to view tableaux as fillings of young diagrams .",
    "it is possible to describe a bijection between syt and nct in these terms .",
    "namely , for every two consecutive rows of a syt , write the numbers in those rows in the increasing order on a circle , going clockwise .",
    "mark the numbers from the upper row with a star .",
    "then there is a unique matching of those @xmath85 numbers which is non - crossing and such that in each edge the smaller label has a star .",
    "the edges of this matching then determine exactly how to arrange the numbers into an nct .",
    "the example is given in figure [ nct12 ] ( figure [ nct5 ] can be viewed as an example as well ) . here",
    "of course we could have used lines instead of circles , as on previous figures .      by analogy with @xmath33 , define @xmath87 to be the set of nct agreeing with @xmath29 .",
    "the elements of the set @xmath87 for @xmath88 and the filling @xmath29 ( unique in this case ) are shown in figure [ nct6 ] .",
    "the labels of @xmath29 are marked .",
    "the following theorem shows that nct - s correspond to a natural basis of @xmath15 .",
    "[ thm : basis ] as @xmath8 runs through all elements of @xmath87 , the corresponding @xmath13-s provide a basis for @xmath37 .    since the number of such @xmath13-s is equal to the dimension of the module , it is enough to show that these elements are linearly independent .",
    "introduce the following order on nct : @xmath89 iff @xmath90 in lexicographic order .",
    "suppose @xmath13-s , as @xmath91 , are not linearly independent .",
    "then a non - trivial linear combination of these @xmath13-s equals @xmath92 .",
    "choose _ the smallest _",
    "( in the order defined above ) @xmath93 such that @xmath94 is involved in one such linear relation with a non - zero coefficient .",
    "now do the following : assign to each variable @xmath95 the value equal to @xmath73 - the label of @xmath11 in @xmath96 .",
    "the value of @xmath94 under assignment is non - zero .",
    "therefore , in the linear dependence relation involving @xmath94 there should be at least one more @xmath13 which is non - zero under this assignment of values to variables .",
    "however , one can see that under this assignment @xmath93 is the largest in the order defined above among the @xmath8-s such that @xmath13 is nonzero - contradiction .",
    "figure [ nct7 ] gives an example of decomposition into @xmath13 corresponding to nct @xmath8-s for @xmath97 .",
    "this corresponds to the equality @xmath98",
    "@xmath99    recall that a semi - standard young tableau is a tableau weakly increasing in rows and strictly increasing in columns .",
    "one way to look at it is the following : for a given filling @xmath100 , we consider segments @xmath101 , [ \\mu_1 + 1 , \\mu_2 ] , \\ldots , [ \\mu_{k-1}+1 , \\mu_k]$ ] of a reading of syt .",
    "next , we consider all syt such that each of its columns contains at most one element of each segment",
    ". then we define an equivalence relation on this set where two syt are equivalent if one is obtained from the other by the action of the young subgroup @xmath102 which permutes the elements of the mentioned segments .",
    "then the equivalence classes are exactly the semi - standard young tableaux of weight @xmath28 .",
    "remarkably , a similar definition works with nct , allowing us to define a `` semi - standard '' version of it .",
    "in particular , given a filling @xmath100 , consider segments @xmath101 , [ \\mu_1 + 1 , \\mu_2 ] , \\ldots , [ \\mu_{k-1}+1 , \\mu_k]$ ] as above . consider all nct such that each of its parts contains at most one element from each segment .",
    "define an equivalence relation on this set where two nct are equivalent if one is obtained from the other by the action of the young subgroup @xmath102 which permutes points of the above segments .",
    "the _ semi - noncrossing tableaux _ , or snct , is the set of equivalence classes we obtain in this way .    [ semi ]",
    "the number of ssyt of shape @xmath2 and weight @xmath28 is equal to the number of snct of shape @xmath2 and weight @xmath28 .    given a yamanuchi word @xmath103 and composition @xmath28 , we say that @xmath103 syt - agrees with @xmath28 if the syt corresponding to @xmath103 agrees with @xmath28 as described above .",
    "similarly define nct - agreeing .",
    "let @xmath104 be the largest word in lexicographic order obtained from @xmath103 by action of @xmath102 .",
    "then the theorem follows from the following two statements , which are easy to verify : if @xmath103 is yamanuchi and syt - agrees with @xmath28 , than @xmath104 is yamanuchi ; if @xmath103 is yamanuchi and nct - agrees with @xmath28 , than @xmath104 is yamanuchi .",
    "now one can see that if @xmath104 is yamanuchi then it syt - agrees and nct - agrees with @xmath28",
    ". therefore both numbers in the statement of the theorem are equal to the same number : the number of @xmath104-s which are yamanuchi .",
    "we sometimes call snct just nct if it is clear from context what is meant .",
    "it is possible to view snct as a filling of a young diagram .",
    "for example , here is a figure showing a snct and the corresponding diagram , on which a potential @xmath29 is also marked :      restrict our attention for a moment to partitions with two parts , that is @xmath105 .",
    "then our nct are non - crossing matchings . the garnir relations which generate all relations among @xmath13-s",
    "can then be described as follows .",
    "given two crossing parts @xmath106 , we form two new tableaux with parts @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "this corresponds to the equality : @xmath111 we say that in this way we",
    "_ resolved _ the crossing @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "given a matching , we can arbitrarily pick pair of crossing edges and resolve it .",
    "note that the total number of crossings in each of the two resulting matchings is strictly smaller than in the original one .",
    "thus after repeated application the process of resolving will stop .",
    "observe that the following is a consequence of theorem  [ thm : basis ] .",
    "the result of the resolving of crossings via operation described above does not depend on the particular way it is done .    if @xmath93 is the original tableaux there is a unique way to represent @xmath94 as a sum of @xmath13-s for nct @xmath8 .",
    "there is a way to see directly that the resulting multiset of nct is going to be the same no matter in which order we do the resolving . given a tableau @xmath8 ,",
    "take a crossing of two segments , `` '' , and replace it with _ vertical uncrossing _ `` ' ' and _ horizontal uncrossing _",
    "when this is done to each crossing , we obtain the set @xmath114 of non - crossing matchings @xmath115 , each possibly containing some cycles . for each of these matchings ,",
    "let @xmath116 be the underlying nct , and let @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the number of cycles in @xmath115 .",
    "@xmath119 .",
    "it follows from the following `` reidemeister moves '' :    note that using this theorem we can compute the explicit entries of the images of elements of @xmath0 in an irreducible representation labeled by a two - part partition .",
    "recall that the _ temperley - lieb algebra _",
    "@xmath120 is the @xmath121$]-algebra generated by @xmath122 subject to the relations @xmath123 , and @xmath124 if @xmath125 , @xmath126 if @xmath127 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath120 equals the @xmath3-th catalan number @xmath128 .",
    "a natural basis of the temperley - lieb algebra is @xmath129 where @xmath130 , for a reduced decomposition @xmath131 . in the case @xmath132 the map @xmath133 determines a homomorphism @xmath134 from the hecke algebra to the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "the generators @xmath135 can be conveniently represented as _ kauffman diagrams _ , shown in the figure .",
    "the construction above is related to @xmath136 .",
    "indeed , assume we have a particular situation when edges of the tableau @xmath8 form a matching between sets @xmath137 and @xmath138",
    ". then @xmath8 can be viewed as a wiring diagram of some permutation @xmath139 .",
    "there exists an obvious correspondence between nct @xmath8 and generators @xmath140 of @xmath136 , since both correspond naturally to non - crossing matchings on the set of @xmath141 vertexes .",

    "the coefficient of @xmath94 in the decomposition of @xmath13 is equal to the coefficient of @xmath142 in @xmath143 .",
