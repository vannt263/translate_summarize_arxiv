    "it is often stated that zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) o  stars should not be and are not observed .",
    "this view arises from at least three sources : star - formation theory , which suggests that the embedded accretion ( merger ? ) phases constitute a significant fraction of the main - sequence lifetimes of massive stars ( 2.5  myr for the most massive ) ; statistical studies of uchii and ir objects relative to optically observed ones ; and detailed physical analyses of optical o - star samples that find very few on the zams .",
    "for instance , repolust , puls , & herrero ( 2004 ) analyzed 24 relatively bright o  stars and found only one , hd  93128 in the carina nebula compact cluster trumpler  14 , on the zams .",
    "however , selection effects may be contributing to this view .",
    "if the optically observable near - zams phase of massive stars is relatively brief , it must be sought in very young regions , which may be distant and/or extincted . also , it is possible that some ir objects are no longer embedded , but rather viewed along unfavorable sightlines in galactic disks or through local , peripheral remanent dust clouds .",
    "for example , if we did not have such fortunate lines of sight toward ngc  3603 and 30  doradus , we might be quite confused about their evolutionary status ( walborn 2002 )",
    ". such must be the case for at least some objects .    over the past 35 years",
    ", this author and others have encountered numerous optical o  stars that appear to be very young for various morphological reasons .",
    "these results are scattered throughout the literature and have not been generally recognized by star - formation and evolutionary specialists , or even by quantitative spectroscopists , whose analyses are essential for the former .",
    "it is hoped that this summary presentation will provide a useful stimulus toward rectifying the omission .",
    "it will be seen that many of the objects in question are in the magellanic clouds . but also",
    ", hd  93128 will reappear in the plot .",
    "the current sample of 50 optically observable , likely zams o  stars is listed in table  1 , along with some normal standard stars for comparison . the zams candidate list was    ' '' ''",

    "( 2006 ) , and in a new lmc fiber survey by i.  howarth ( private communication ) .",
    "the sample is divided into five categories according to the distinct , principal discovery criteria , although many of them actually display more than one , as noted in the comments .",
    "three of these criteria are spectroscopic , one is environmental , and one is photometric .",
    "discovery and/or data references are included in the table .",
    "the five categories will now be discussed in turn .      4026 , 4471 and he  ii @xmath14200 , 4541 , 4686 .",
    "n  iii @xmath14634 - 40 - 42 emission is marked above hd  93146 , likewise si  iv @xmath04089 and s  iv @xmath14486 - 4504 ( werner & rauch 2001 ) in hd  163758 .",
    "note the comparable strengths of the @xmath14541 , 4686 absorptions in the class  v spectrum , and the weakening , then transition to emission of the latter with increasing luminosity , while the n  iii emission increases smoothly .",
    "the si  iv absorption has a positive luminosity effect , which is more sensitive at later types .",
    "courtesy of ian howarth . ]",
    "a luminosity classification for stars earlier than spectral type o9 was introduced by walborn ( 1971 , 1972 , 1973a ) .",
    "it is based upon the selective emission effects ( walborn 2001 ) in he  ii",
    "@xmath04686 and the n  iii triplet @xmath14634 - 4640 - 4642 , i.e. , the of phenomenon . these same lines display a _ negative _ effect in absorption with increasing luminosity in the mk o9b0 classification , which was hypothesized to be caused by filling in of the absorptions by the same emission effects producing the of phenomenon , thus providing the basis for a luminosity classification at the earlier types .",
    "a luminosity sequence at spectral type o6.5 in modern digital data is shown in figure  1 . as can be seen there , this he  ii line is a strong absorption feature in class  v , which then weakens , neutralizes , and finally comes into emission above the continuum in the ia supergiant .",
    "( correlatively , the n  iii , already weakly in emission at class  v , increases in strength with increasing luminosity . )",
    "4686 absorption relative to the other he lines in these spectra , and also the great strength of the balmer lines in lh10@xmath23126 .",
    "lh10@xmath23264 is in the dense nebular knot n11a , which produces the very strong nebular emission lines .",
    "courtesy of joel parker . ]    walborn ( 1973 ) first noted that in the trumpler  14 o - dwarf spectra , the @xmath04686 absorption appeared stronger relative to the other he  lines than in typical class  v spectra .",
    "this very compact cluster in the carina nebula appears to be very young ; it contains the o2  if * prototype , likely pre - wn object hd  93129a ( walborn et  al .",
    "penny et  al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that this cluster is approximately 550,000 years old , while repolust et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) derived an age of 150,000 years for hd  93128 .",
    "subsequently , even more extreme examples were found in the lmc giant h  ii regions 30  dor and n11 ( parker et  al .  1992 ; walborn & parker 1992 ; parker 1993 ; walborn & blades 1997 ) .",
    "some of the n11 spectra are reproduced in figure  2 , and some new galactic examples kindly provided for this presentation by v.  niemela and n.  morrell are shown in figure  3 .    4058 emission is marked in hd  64568 here .",
    "courtesy of virpi niemela and nidia morrell . ]",
    "a fairly obvious hypothesis is that the stronger @xmath04686 absorption in these probably very young objects is an `` inverse '' of effect , or more precisely , that typical class  v spectra already have some emission filling in that line while these objects have less , and hence may be less luminous and less evolved , i.e. , nearer to the zams . to denote that hypothesis ,",
    "the luminosity class notation vz has been introduced .",
    "some analytical support has been provided by the work of venero , cidale , & ringuelet ( 2002 ) , martins et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) , and mokiem et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but a homogeneous analysis of the full sample in high - resolution data with state - of - the - art photospheric / wind models is essential to investigate whether the vz stars as a class have systematically higher gravities and lower luminosities than class  v. in table  1 , the three blocks of vz stars correspond to the galaxy , lmc , and smc .",
    "a misunderstanding of the vz definition in late - o spectra should be clarified here . at early o  types , the he",
    "ii  @xmath04686 absorption should be stronger than he  ii  @xmath04541 . at type o7 , he  ii  @xmath04541 is equal to he  i  @xmath04471 , so that @xmath04686 is stronger than both in a vz spectrum . at later o  types",
    ", however , @xmath04541 weakens more rapidly with advancing type than @xmath04686 in normal class  v spectra ; thus , a late - o vz spectrum must have @xmath04686 _ stronger than he  i  @xmath04471_.",
    "w.  morgan frequently remarked on a peculiarity of the orion nebula cluster ob  stars , namely broader balmer lines than in normal class  v spectra , with profiles that did not appear to be rotational ; morgan & keenan ( 1973 ) reproduced photographic spectrograms of @xmath3  ori  c and the o7  v standard 15  mon to illustrate the effect . at some point",
    ", he introduced the notation vb to denote such spectra , by analogy with ib for less luminous supergiants and iiib in keenan s subdivision of late - type giants .",
    "( abt 1979 cites a photographic atlas prepared with morgan that appeared in 1978 as the source of the new notation , but it does not appear there . )",
    "abt ( 1979 ) and levato & malaroda ( 1981 , 1982 ) presented further examples among b  and  a dwarf spectra in very young clusters .",
    "as for the vz category , the question arises whether the vb phenomenon might be caused by higher gravity and lower luminosity than in class  v , since it is well known that the balmer lines weaken with increasing luminosity in ob  spectra due to the decreasing stark effect .",
    "a careful analysis of the five ob components of @xmath3 and @xmath4  ori has been presented by simn - daz et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , including a thorough investigation of line - broadening mechanisms and comparison with standard objects ( including 15  mon ) analyzed with the same techniques .",
    "interestingly , they find that h and he lines in the orion stars tend to be broader than in the best fitting models , most systematically in the b0.5  v spectrum of @xmath3  ori  d. however , they derive similar gravities to those of the comparison stars and find that the orion stars are somewhat off the zams , although uncertainties in the latter result remain because of the extinction law and , as they point out , the effect of initial rotational velocities on the location of the zams . in table  1 , a value of @xmath5 ( average of 3.0 and 5.5 ) has been used to calculate the absolute magnitudes of the trapezium stars , because the actual value in the orion nebula remains uncertain ( robberto et  al .",
    "2004 ) ; thus their subluminosity is uncertain as well .",
    "@xmath3  ori  c is now known as the first o - type magnetic oblique rotator ( donati et  al .  2002 ; smith & fullerton 2005 ; gagn et  al .  2005 ; wade et  al .",
    "2006 ) and an extreme spectrum variable , including its abnormally weak uv  wind profiles ( walborn & nichols 1994 ; stahl et  al .  1996 ) .",
    "simn - daz et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) provide a detailed discussion of the effects of the variability on the quantitative analysis .",
    "moreover , there is now evidence that the spectrum of 15  mon may be variable as well ; simn - daz et  al .",
    "also discuss the effects of its spectroscopic companion in that connection .",
    "further quantitative analyses incorporating these complications are indicated to ascertain the nature of the vb balmer profiles and the physical origin of the peculiarity .",
    "it is now well known that the ultraviolet stellar - wind profiles in o - type spectra display strong correlations with the optical spectral types , including an increase in strength with increasing luminosity ( walborn , nichols - bohlin , & panek 1985 ) .",
    "that study also detected four main - sequence stars with abnormally weak wind profiles for their spectral types , including @xmath3  ori  c already discussed in the previous section .",
    "hd  5005a in the young cluster ngc  281 is also located in a trapezium system , while hd  42088 ionizes the small , dusty h  ii region ngc  2175 , which might appear knot - like ( cf .",
    "next section ) if it were at the distance of the magellanic clouds .",
    "again , the inverse behavior of these weak wind profiles with respect to normal spectra suggests that these stars may be less luminous and less evolved than typical class  v objects , but quantitative confirmation of this hypothesis is so far lacking .",
    "martins et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) found a relatively weak wind for hd  42088 , but a normal hrd location ; however , the distance of this star is highly uncertain .",
    "( it should be noted that most of the stars in table  1 have not yet been observed in the far uv . )",
    "walborn & blades ( 1987 ) reported the detection of o - type spectra in two dense nebular knots within the 30  doradus nebula in the lmc , suggesting that they might correspond to very young objects just emerging from their natal cocoons .",
    "subsequent work , both from the ground and with _ hst _ , has amply confirmed that suggestion and revealed additional examples in 30  dor ( walborn & blades 1997 , walborn et  al .  1999 , 2002a )",
    "; several have been resolved into multiple ( trapezium ) stellar systems by _",
    "the very strong nebular emission lines in these objects obliterate the stellar he  i absorption and thus preclude accurate classification , as only the he  ii can be seen , leading to the o3 - 6  v type ( there is no uncertainty in the luminosity class , which depends on only he  ii @xmath04686 ) ; in fact , several examples re - observed spectroscopically with _ hst _ , its very high spatial resolution suppressing the nebular background , turn out to have even later o  types than that range previously assigned from the ground ( table  1 ) .",
    "the reddening and absolute magnitudes of these stars have kindly been derived by l.  beda from the wfpc2 photometry using the chorizos code ( maz - apellniz 2004 ) ; a normal reddening law had to be adopted because of the limited wavelength coverage .",
    "lh10@xmath23264 ( parker et  al .  1992 ,",
    "walborn & parker 1992 ; fig .",
    "3 here ) , which is also vz , is another interesting case in the lmc compact h  ii region n11a ; it has also been resolved into a multiple system with _",
    "hst _ by heydari - malayeri et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and the entry in table  1 ( n11a-7 ) corresponds to the brightest component .",
    "n81 is a similar object in the smc , investigated with _",
    "hst _ by heydari - malayeri et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; the weakness of the stellar - wind profiles in these stars may be caused by a combination of extreme youth and the smc metal deficiency .      in the spectroscopic study of the 30  doradus stellar populations by walborn & blades ( 1997 ) , the derived absolute magnitudes for a number of the o  v stars fall below the calibration of that luminosity class ( cf .",
    "their fig .  3 ) .",
    "those that are not also classified as vz are listed separately in table  1 .",
    "it is reasonable to hypothesize that they may be nearer to or on the zams .",
    "however , a basic uncertainty , which also applies to some subluminous cases discussed in the previous sections , must be recognized : because of the lack of further information , the absolute magnitudes have to be derived with a normal value of @xmath6 . for a fixed distance modulus and variable extinction ,",
    "a larger value of @xmath7 would yield brighter absolute magnitudes . to resolve this issue , photometric observations covering a wider wavelength range ( ideally , uv through ir )",
    "must be obtained to support the derivation of reddening laws toward each individual star .",
    "indeed , there is evidence that the reddening law may vary among different lines of sight within a complex h  ii region environment , because of spatially diverse mixtures of dust grain properties . in any event , large values of @xmath7",
    "are associated with large dust grains and very young objects , so these stars may be near the zams in either case , but again , further observations and quantitative analyses are required to definitively establish their physical status .",
    "all of the absolute magnitudes from table  1 are plotted against the spectral types in figure  4 , where they are also compared with the schaller et  al .",
    "( 1992 ) zams and isochrones , as well as the luminosity class  v calibration ( walborn 1973 ) .",
    "the different categories of zams candidates are distinguished with different symbols .",
    "subject to the uncertainties already discussed , the plot provides preliminary support for the present hypothesis : most of them fall below the class  v calibration and near the zams . note that hd  93128 lies adjacent to the zams , in agreement with the detailed analysis of repolust et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) . the normal class  v stars cluster about the calibration , as well they should since they contributed to its derivation .",
    "interestingly , the figure shows that a typical o3  v star is 1  myr old , o5  v 2  myr , o67  v 3  myr , and o89  v perhaps 45  myr .",
    "less luminous stars at a given type must be younger .",
    "it is also clear that unresolved multiple systems move points upward in the diagram ( recall that 01 corresponds to 5000  au at the lmc ) , while underestimated values of @xmath7 move them downward .",
    "the present sample of candidate zams stars is optimum for followup with high - resolution spectroscopy and state - of - the - art atmospheric / wind analysis . beyond the basic question of their zams status or",
    "otherwise , it may be hoped that such study will elucidate any sequential relationships among the different categories , thereby advancing our detailed understanding of early massive stellar evolution .",
