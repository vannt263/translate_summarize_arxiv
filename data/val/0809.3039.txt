    "the possibility that a body recoils while emitting gravitational radiation has been known for decades@xcite .",
    "this problem has been considered in the literature by means of many approximated and semi - analytical methods as , for instance , the particle approximation@xcite , post - newtonian methods@xcite , and the close - limit approximation@xcite , leading to typical recoil velocities of few hundreds of km / s for some realistic cases .",
    "such conclusions , however , have changed drastically due to some recent advances in numerical relativity@xcite . in particular , recent numerical simulations@xcite of the merging process of binary black - holes indicate that asymmetrical gravitational wave emission can indeed induce the merger remnant to recoil with velocities up to several thousands of km / s . the physical nature and possible implications of such considerably higher gravitational recoil are now under intense investigation ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the calculation of the recoil velocity as a function of the black - holes initial conditions is a particularly important hard task .",
    "since the full non - linear regime of einstein equations is extremely intricate and costly to analyze , some approximated or `` empirical '' formulas relating the recoil velocity and the initial data have been proposed@xcite .",
    "the robinson - trautman ( rt ) spacetime @xcite is perhaps the simplest solutions of general relativity which can be interpreted as an isolated gravitational radiating system and , hence , it is certainly pertinent to the study of the gravitational recoil effect .",
    "however , despite the many strong mathematical results on the rt solutions available in the literature , only a few exact examples of rt spacetime are indeed known in explicit form ( see , for references , @xcite ) .",
    "it is known , nevertheless , that a regular initial data , corresponding typically to a compact body surrounded by gravitational waves , will evolve smoothly according to the rt equation into a final state corresponding to a remnant schwarzschild black - hole@xcite , which can be at rest or moving with constant speed .",
    "our aim here is to go a step further in the characterization of such final evolution state as function of the initial conditions .",
    "our results are motivated and checked by some numerical analysis .",
    "the robinson - trautman partial differential equation has been analyzed numerically in the recent literature@xcite , being particularly suitable to be numerically solved by means of spectral methods@xcite .",
    "we will follow oliveira and damio soares@xcite and adopt the galerkin method@xcite for our analysis . however , as we will show , we will implement it in a different way that will allow us to get simpler equations and a better accuracy .",
    "the present paper has four sections and one appendix . in the next section ,",
    "the main aspects of axisymmetric rt spacetimes are presented briefly .",
    "we show , in particular , how to read from the final state of the rt evolution the mass and speed of the remnant black - hole .",
    "it is also shown that , as expected , for ( reflection-)symmetric initial data there is no radiation recoil .",
    "in such a case , the mass of the remnant black - hole and the total energy radiated away are completely determined by the initial data , allowing us to establish analytical expressions for the results about the total radiated energy obtained numerically in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "section iii is devoted to the study of generic axisymmetric initial data .",
    "we show that a typical rt evolution can lead to a gravitational recoil .",
    "a galerkin projection method is used to calculate the final black - hole speed .",
    "we show also how the final recoil velocity can be estimated with good accuracy from some asymmetry measures of the initial configuration , namely the first odd moments of the initial data . in the last section ,",
    "we discuss the physical interpretation of the typical initial data considered in this work , emphasizing their relation with the problem of frontal collision of two black - holes .",
    "the extension of our results to the non - axisymmetric case is also commented in the last section .",
    "the appendix presents a direct proof of a mathematical result used in section ii , namely that , for regular initial data , the final state of the rt evolution does correspond generically to a schwarzschild black hole moving with constant speed .",
    "the standard form of the robinson - trautman ( rt ) metric in the usual spherical radiation coordinates @xmath0 reads@xcite [ rt ] ds^2 = -(k - 2 - r ( q^2)_u)du^2 - 2dudr + d^2 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is a constant mass parameter , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 stand for , respectively , the metric of the unit sphere and the gaussian curvature of the surface corresponding to @xmath5 and @xmath6 constant , which is given by k = q^2(1 + ^2_q^2 ) , with @xmath7 corresponding to the laplacian on the unit sphere .",

    "several classical results assure that , given a geometrically regular initial data @xmath18 , the solution of ( [ rt1 ] ) approaches asymptotically a stationary ( @xmath19 ) regime .",

    "nevertheless , our choice of @xmath16 yields @xmath28 .",
    "we choose in this work a parametrization such that @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    given a normalized regular initial data @xmath18 , the asymptotic solution of ( [ rt1 ] ) will be always of the form @xmath31 .",
    "the final configuration is , hence , completely characterized by the sole parameter @xmath32 . in order to unveil its physical role ,",
    "let us consider the bondi s mass function@xcite [ mass ] m(u ) = _",

    "the non - vanishing components of the bondi s four - momentum are @xmath46 and p_3(u ) = _",
    "-1 ^ 1 dx , which corresponds to the momentum carried by the solution along the @xmath37 axis . for normalized initial data",
    "one has for @xmath34 @xmath47 reinforcing the interpretation of @xmath48 as the final velocity of the remnant black - hole .",
    "notice that , for symmetric ( even ) initial data @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ lambdax ] ) implies that the solutions @xmath49 of ( [ rt1 ] ) are necessarily even for @xmath50 , establishing that there is no gravitational recoil ( @xmath51 ) in this case .",
    "such a behavior is , of course , in full agreement with the expectation that gravitation recoil should be due to non - reflection - symmetric gravitational wave emission .",
    "therefore , for even situations , the constraint ( [ constr ] ) determines completely the final evolution state .",
    "the fraction of the initial mass @xmath52 radiated away along the @xmath12-evolution governed by ( [ rt1 ] ) can be calculated exactly for even configurations .",
    "following @xcite , we define = , which clearly corresponds to the fraction of the initial mass lost due to gravitational wave emission . for even configurations , @xmath51 and we",
    "have simply = 1 - 2 ( _ -1 ^ 1 ) ^-1 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath53 . as an explicit example of this exactly soluble case ,",
    "let us consider the first even initial data considered in the papers @xcite , namely the prolate spheroid corresponding to [ prola ] q^2(0,x ) = q_0 ^ 2 ( 1-^2x^2 ) , with @xmath54 .",
    "the constraint @xmath16 implies that q_0 ^ 2 = ( ) , leading finally to [ delta ] = 1 - .",
    "this is the exact analytical expression for the curves obtained in @xcite and @xcite from numerical simulations . for sake of comparison with the results of @xcite , fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] depicts a semi - log plot of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 , following their conventions .",
    "a very good agreement is found .",
    "one can proceed in an analogous way for any other even ( reflection - symmetric ) configuration , we will return to this issue in the last section .",
    "the exact expression for @xmath55 is certainly valuable to the investigation of statistical properties of the non - linear gravitational wave emission as those ones considered in @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is clear from ( [ delta ] ) that the non - extensive    distribution function proposed in @xcite is only an approximation valid for small @xmath57 .",
    "in fact , we have [ decay ] = ( 1-y)^4 + ( 1-y)^6 + o((1-y)^8 ) , for @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "the evolution of generic initial data @xmath18 is a greater challenge .",
    "since the gravitational recoil is clearly related to the odd part of the function @xmath49 , one might consider in first place some asymmetry measures of the initial data .",

    "[ fig2 ]    shows the first final odd moments @xmath64 as functions of the recoil velocity @xmath48 .",
    "as we will show , the relevance of the first odd moments ( [ qn0 ] ) rests on the fact that one can construct , as a linear combination of them , a second approximately conserved quantity along the solutions of the rt equation ( [ rt1 ] ) in the framework of the galerkin approximation .",
    "we introduce now a galerkin decomposition for @xmath49 [ gal ] q(u , x ) = _",

    "the integration can be performed exactly for arbitrary @xmath68 ( with the help of algebraic manipulation software as maple , for instance ) , yielding @xmath69 order polynomials on the mode functions @xmath70 .",
    "notice that here , in contrast to the approach adopted in @xcite , no transcendental function is involved in the galerkin approximation .",
    "now , the cauchy problem for the rt equation corresponds basically in choosing the initial value of the mode functions @xmath71 according to [ data ] b_(0 ) = q(0,x ) , p _ , and then to solve the initial value problem ( ivp ) given by ( [ rtg ] ) .",
    "equation ( [ rtg ] ) has some useful properties that are independent of @xmath68 .",
    "for instance , their stationary solutions ( @xmath72 ) have necessarily @xmath73 for @xmath74 and arbitrary ( constants ) @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "indeed , for any regular initial data , the systems evolves into the final state @xmath77 , with @xmath78 for the normalized case , as expected .",
    "the recoil velocity will be given simply by @xmath79 .",
    "another useful property is that for an even initial data , one has @xmath80 for odd @xmath81 and , consequently , @xmath51 .",
    "the accuracy of the galerkin decomposition is determined by the truncation order @xmath68 in ( [ gal ] ) .",
    "it can be controlled effectively here by checking the conserved quantity @xmath82 along the @xmath12-evolution . typically , the expansion with @xmath68 legendre polynomials in ( [ gal ] ) is accurate provided that @xmath83 be small enough .    finally , we are able now to consider the evolution of generic initial data .",
    "the recoil velocity @xmath48 can be calculated by solving the ivp corresponding to the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ rtg ] ) with initial conditions ( [ data ] ) .",
    "the recoil velocity determines completely the final state for normalized initial data , allowing the study of any other relevant quantity as , for instance , the fraction @xmath55 of the initial mass radiated away as a function of the non - reflection - symmetric initial data , [ delta11 ] = 1 - ( _ -1 ^ 1 ) ^-1 .",
    "we have performed an exhaustive numerical analysis of the system ( [ rtg ] ) .",
    "the considered initial data include the following simple but representative family [ family ] q(0,x ) = q_0 ( 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 ) , where the constant @xmath84 is always chosen in order to ensure the normalization @xmath16 .",

    "we notice that , for the family of initial conditions ( [ family ] ) , we always have @xmath85 for @xmath86 and , in this case , @xmath87 is sufficient to assure typically an accuracy ( controlled by the constant @xmath88 ) of the galerkin approximation up to 1% .",
    "initial data with high @xmath89 typically require higher @xmath68 in order to attain a given accuracy .",
    "the radiation content of the initial data can also give some clues about the minimal necessary value of @xmath68 , see section iv .",
    "despite that the ivp associated to the equation ( [ rtg ] ) can be solved with quite modest computational resources , an analytical estimation of the recoil velocity @xmath48 from the initial data would be certainly valuable .",
    "since the final state of the rt evolution is completely characterized by the sole parameter @xmath48 for normalized initial data , a second conserved quantity besides @xmath82 would suffice to determine completely the final state and , consequently , to determine the recoil velocity @xmath48 .",
    "unfortunately , the rt equation ( [ rt1 ] ) does not seem to have any other conserved quantity rather than @xmath82 .",
    "on the other hand , its galerkin approximation ( [ rtg ] ) does indeed have a second conserved quantity .",
    "such a new conserved quantity , however , will be only approximately constant along the solutions of the full rt equation . nevertheless , the approximation will be as good as the galerkin approximation is accurate . in order to construct an explicit expression for the new constant",

    "the right - handed side of ( [ dqn01 ] ) has exactly @xmath68 terms , implying , therefore , that one can have at most @xmath68 linear independent equations of the type ( [ dqn0 ] ) .",
    "the linear relation between @xmath92 and @xmath90 given by ( [ dqn01 ] ) involves a hilbert - type matrix@xcite and , in particular , it is always possible to find @xmath93 rational numbers @xmath94 such that [ alpha ] ( _ = 1^n+1 _ q_2 - 1(u ) ) = 0 .",
    "the quantity between parenthesis is conserved along the solutions of ( [ rtg ] ) and , therefore , it corresponds to our second conserved quantity .",
    "one could also truncate the summation in ( [ dqn01 ] ) in a given @xmath81 , obtaining partial linear combination of the odd moments that are constant along the solutions of ( [ rtg ] ) up to deviations proportional to max @xmath95 .",
    "the first of such partial linear combinations are @xmath96 the coefficients in the above expressions and the @xmath94 of ( [ alpha ] ) can be calculated in a straightforward way by using , for instance , gauss elimination in ( [ dqn01 ] ) .",
    "however , our numerical calculations show that , for the typical initial data considered here , the first odd moment @xmath97 _ dominates _ over the other ones , implying that the typical variations @xmath98 are rather small .",
    "we notice also that the typical initial data of the family ( [ family ] ) considered here has @xmath99 , in agreement with the magnitude of the odd moments for the final state , see fig .",
    "this situation can fail for some very specific initial conditions .",
    "for instance , if one has @xmath100 , @xmath97 will vary considerably along the solutions of ( [ rtg ] ) , but the combination given by ( [ cond1 ] ) will be approximately constant , and so on .",

    "<S> we consider the gravitational recoil due to non - reflection - symmetric gravitational wave emission in the context of axisymmetric robinson - trautman spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> we show that regular initial data evolve generically into a final configuration corresponding to a schwarzschild black - hole moving with constant speed . for the case of ( reflection-)symmetric initial configurations , </S>",
    "<S> the mass of the remnant black - hole and the total energy radiated away are completely determined by the initial data , allowing us to obtain analytical expressions for some recent numerical results that have been appeared in the literature . moreover , by using the galerkin spectral method to analyze the non - linear regime of the robinson - trautman equations , we show that the recoil velocity can be estimated with good accuracy from some asymmetry measures ( namely the first odd moments ) of the initial data . </S>",
    "<S> the extension for the non - axisymmetric case and the implications of our results for realistic situations involving head - on collision of two black holes are also discussed . </S>"
