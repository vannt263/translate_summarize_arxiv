    "the microscopic origin of the sliding friction of thin films adsorbed on a metal surface has recently attracted considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "the availability of refined experimental methods  @xcite makes it now feasible to investigate the fundamental processes that contribute to the sliding friction on an atomic scale . on a metal surface ,",
    "frictional energy is dissipated via two main channels : excitation of low - energy electron - hole pairs in the substrate  @xcite and excitation of phonons within the overlayer  @xcite .",
    "phonon excitation within the metal may also occur ; however , this contribution usually has only a minor influence on the lateral sliding of adsorbed films .",
    "detailed experimental information on the friction of xe and kr layers on noble metal surfaces was recently obtained by krim _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite who performed quartz - crystal microbalance ( qcm ) measurements for a variety of coverages . in this technique , the frequency shift and broadening of the resonant line provide information on the number of adsorbed atoms and on their slippage during the lateral oscillation of the microbalance .",
    "the data were analyzed by various theoretical groups that , surprisingly , arrived at contradictory conclusions : for kr on au(111 ) , cieplak _ et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that the observed friction is caused by lattice vibrations within the overlayer and that substrate - induced energy dissipation plays a negligible role .",
    "dominant phonon damping was also inferred for xe on ag(111 ) by tomassone _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , persson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite argued that the phonon - associated friction for a full xe monolayer on ag(100 ) is small and that the measured friction is mainly of electronic origin .",
    "these opposite interpretations are puzzling since all three theoretical studies were based on molecular dynamics simulations for similar models of the rare gas / metal adsorption system .",
    "in addition , liebsch  @xcite performed dynamical surface response calculations within the time - dependent density functional approach to determine the electronic friction of xe atoms on ag .",
    "the lateral component of the friction coefficient was shown to agree qualitatively with the experimental value for a full monolayer , suggesting that phonon processes play a minor role in the compressed phase .    in view of these fundamental theoretical discrepancies",
    ", we decided to carry out molecular dynamics simulations for xe on ag , employing essentially the same overall model as previous authors  @xcite .",
    "key input parameters in these simulations are , in particular , the corrugation amplitude of the xe / ag interaction potential and the electronic friction of individual xe atoms sliding parallel to the substrate surface . since at present the corrugation amplitude is known from independent experimental data only with very appreciable uncertainty , a detailed understanding of how its magnitude influences the final result is in our view crucial .",
    "in contrast to the earlier molecular dynamics studies , therefore , we do not choose a specific set of input model parameters but investigate the net sliding friction within a wide range of these parameters .",
    "in addition , we consider the dependence on the crystallographic orientation by studying the friction of a xe layer adsorbed on ag(111 ) and ag(100 ) , in order to check the importance of the lateral symmetry of the substrate potential . by carrying out such a systematic investigation",
    "we essentially cover the full range of overlayer / substrate models considered in the previous treatments .    a striking feature of the xe / ag quartz - crystal microbalance data by krim _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is the strong variation of the net sliding friction with xe coverage . to facilitate the discussion ,",
    "we show in fig .  1 the measured slip time @xmath0 as a function of xe coverage  @xcite on ag(111 ) .",
    "the friction coefficient @xmath1 is given by the inverse of the slip time .",
    "according to surface resistivity measurements for xe on ag  @xcite , the electronic friction coefficient depends weakly on coverage .",
    "it is evident , therefore , that the rapid coverage dependence observed in the qcm data , in particular near completion of a monolayer , is caused primarily by phonons generated within the overlayer .",
    "this is not surprising since the probability of exciting phonons varies greatly with inter - adatom spacing . with respect to this aspect of the data",
    ", there is little dispute among the previous simulations studies .     for xe on ag(111 ) , as a function of coverage , after ref .",
    "in this paper we put forward arguments , based on extensive simulations , to show that the region roughly between the dotted lines can be understood as due to phonon originated friction , while above the upper dotted line a friction mechanism of electronic origin seems to prevail . ]    the important question , rather , concerns the relative weights of electronic and phononic dissipation channels , especially at coverages near a full monolayer where the slip time reaches its maximum , i.e. , where the sliding friction of the incommensurate overlayer is smallest .",
    "our results show that the effective friction parameter @xmath1 may be approximately written as @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the parallel component of the single - atom electronic friction coefficient and the intra - adsorbate phonon contribution is roughly given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the corrugation amplitude of the xe / ag potential .",
    "a quadratic variation with @xmath5 agrees with the analytical and numerical results of cieplak _ et al . _",
    "the coefficient @xmath6 depends weakly on the crystal face and on the single - atom friction parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but varies strongly with coverage .",
    "evidently , according to the above expression , the measured sliding friction at any given coverage can be reproduced using several combinations of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath9 .",
    "for instance , by reducing the single - site electronic friction @xmath7 , one is able to match the data if the substrate potential is assumed to be sufficiently strongly corrugated .",
    "conversely , if the electronic friction is chosen large enough , little additional phonon damping is required to reproduce the same net @xmath1 .",
    "constraints on the range of acceptable parameter values are implied by the observed variation of the slip time with coverage , in particular , by the steep slope near completion of the first monolayer .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations for xe on ag , which we describe below , suggest that the characteristic coverage dependence of the observed slip time and its overall magnitude can not be understood only in terms of phonon dissipation . although there is considerable uncertainty both in the calculated and measured friction coefficients ,",
    "the most likely scenario is the presence of a roughly coverage - independent electronic contribution of about @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and an additional , strongly coverage - dependent phonon friction , which can reduce the slip time to about @xmath12 ( the net sliding friction then increases approximately to @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus , roughly speaking , we associate the slip time in the region between the horizontal dotted lines in fig .  1 with phonon processes , while the portion above the upper line is related to electronic energy dissipation .",
    "remarkably , the electronic friction deduced from this analysis is in qualitative agreement with independent surface resistivity data for xe on ag  @xcite and with theoretical estimates of this dissipation channel  @xcite .",
    "thus , the friction of a full monolayer is essentially of electronic origin , while the rapid increase of the slip time before reaching the complete monolayer is due to excitation of phonons within the xe overlayer .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii summarizes the theoretical results available for the electronic friction of xe atoms on a metal surface .",
    "section iii presents the model employed in the molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "in particular , we specify the interaction potentials and the friction felt by a single xe atom .",
    "various technical aspects of the calculation of the phonon friction are also discussed .",
    "section iv contains the results , with special emphasis on the variation of the net sliding friction with the corrugation of the substrate potential and its dependence on the electronic friction .",
    "our conclusions are given in section v.",
    "we consider first the electronic contributions to the sliding friction of individual xe atoms above a metal surface . in a physisorption system , these may arise due to the van der waals attraction and the pauli repulsion . in the case of xe , some dissipation might also be associated with the formation of a weak covalent bond .",
    "it is well known that the instantaneous mutual polarization between neutral species gives rise to the long - range van der waals attraction . if an atom moves relative to a metal , the induced surface charge lags behind , causing kinetic energy to be dissipated .",
    "thus , as pointed out long ago by various authors  @xcite , the excitation of low - frequency electron - hole pairs in the surface region contributes to the friction of neutral atoms .",
    "if the adatom velocity is small compared to the fermi velocity of the metal electrons , the friction coefficient may be expressed as @xcite @xmath14 the index @xmath15 refers to parallel or perpendicular motion of the atom , @xmath16 is the many - body response function of the metal , and @xmath17 is the adatom mass .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath18 is approximately given by @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the static polarizability of the adatom and @xmath21 is the location relative to the jellium edge .",
    "since @xmath18 does not satisfy the laplace equation , it can only be approximately represented in terms of a superposition of evanescent plane waves of the form @xcite @xmath22 with this expansion we can write @xmath23 as @xmath24 where the surface response function @xmath25 is defined as @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the electronic surface density induced by an external potential given by @xmath28 .    in the case of xe atoms physisorbed on ag(111 ) at a temperature @xmath29",
    "k , the distance @xmath30   .",
    "the static polarizability of xe is @xmath31  @xmath32 . using the density functional results for @xmath27 and @xmath25",
    ", we find @xmath33  ns@xmath34 and @xmath35  ns@xmath34 @xcite .",
    "we note that the theoretical value of @xmath7 given above presumably represents a slight overestimate since the xe atom is not completely outside the range of the electronic density profile as implicitely assumed in ( [ img ] ) .",
    "moreover , as a result of the hybridization between the ag @xmath36 and @xmath37 electrons , the surface polarizability of real ag may be slightly smaller than that of the corresponding jellium model  @xcite .",
    "we also point out that , according to ( [ vi ] ) , the friction coefficient varies asymptotically like @xmath38 , i.e. , it is rather sensitive to the precise location of the adatom above the metal surface .",
    "the friction coefficient arising from the van der waals attraction derived above is significantly larger than the contribution due to the pauli repulsion which was estimated by persson  @xcite to be about @xmath39  ns@xmath34 .",
    "in addition , for xe there may exist some friction due to chemical effects resulting from the broadening of the xe @xmath40 level .",
    "estimates of this mechanism yield  @xcite @xmath41  ns@xmath34 .    on the basis of these theoretical calculations and estimates ,",
    "we conclude that the total electronic contribution to the lateral friction of single xe atoms on ag is approximately @xmath42  ns@xmath34 . at full monolayer coverage",
    ", this friction is presumably slightly smaller because of the weakening of the xe / ag bonds .",
    "an electronic contribution of this magnitude is in excellent agreement with the surface resistivity measurements for xe on ag  @xcite .    according to our molecular dynamics simulations at @xmath29  k",
    ", the distance of xe atoms normal to the surface varies about 0.1    around the equilibrium distance @xmath30   . for the asymptotic van der waals attraction",
    ", such a variation implies a variation of @xmath7 roughly between 0.2 and 0.5  ns@xmath34 . for the pauli and covalent - bond contributions the variation is exponential due to wave function overlap , with an exponent determined by the work function",
    "this leads to a variation of @xmath7 of about 20 % .",
    "thus , for some xe atoms , the electronic friction is larger , for others smaller than the equilibrium value @xmath42  ns@xmath34 quoted above . because of this uncertainty",
    "the simulations are carried out for a sufficiently wide range of electronic friction coefficients .",
    "in this section we focus on the evaluation of the friction induced by the excitation of phonons within the adsorbed layer of xe atoms .",
    "the single - atom frictional properties are assumed to be known and are used as inputs in the molecular dynamics simulation .",
    "we specify first the intra - adsorbate and adsorbate  substrate potentials and then discuss details concerning the molecular dynamics simulations .      as in previous work  @xcite",

    "the decay constant @xmath57 of the fourier component should in principle be larger than @xmath55 . however , this difference is not very important and we choose @xmath58 .",
    "the corrugation factor @xmath59 is assumed to vanish at hollow adsorption sites .",

    "@xcite , on the other hand , used the expression derived by steele  @xcite for a sum of pair potentials .",
    "since this potential is much more corrugated than the true interaction between rare gas atoms and metal surfaces , the coefficient of the non - vanishing fourier component was drastically scaled down .",
    "the functional form of this potential also differs from expression ( [ u ] ) .",
    "however , the precise shape near the potential minimum should not be crucial , as long as the overall corrugation is the same .    since the parameter @xmath5 is decisive for the excitation of phonons within the overlayer",

    "@xcite;(iii )  one can apply a constant force to the adatoms up to a specific point in time and then switch it off .",
    "if the friction is viscous , the decay of the steady - state velocity of the adsorbate is proportional to @xmath68 ;  ( iv )  finally , one may determine @xmath1 from the thermal equilibrium autocorrelation function of the center of mass velocity of the overlayer .",

    "we illustrate this point in fig .  7 , where the net sliding friction of the uncompressed monolayer ( @xmath97 ) is compared with that for a fully compressed xe layer ( @xmath140 ) and for a less dense layer ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "the compression is seen to lead to a greatly reduced phonon - induced contribution to @xmath1 . on ag(100 ) as well as ag(111 ) , the magnitude of @xmath6 is reduced by more than a factor of two .",
    "a strong reduction of dissipation via phonons upon compression is to be expected since the xe atoms are much less free to vibrate about the equilibrium positions .",
    "the opposite trend is found if the coverage is reduced below that of the uncompressed monolayer . for xe on ag(100 ) at coverage @xmath141",
    ", the coefficient @xmath6 is about @xmath142  ns@xmath34mev@xmath91 , i.e. , three times larger than for @xmath97 .",
    "an even more dramatic increase of @xmath6 is found on ag(111 ) .",
    "the strong enhancement of @xmath1 is caused by the higher probability of exciting atomic vibrations in the less dense overlayer phase .     of xe layers on ag as a function of corrugation amplitude @xmath5 for coverages @xmath143 .",

    "one obtains values of @xmath5 in the approximate range between 0.5 and 2  mev . from eq .",
    "( [ c ] ) it follows that @xmath136 varies with the fourth power of @xmath153 .",
    "this is born out by our simulations which show that such barriers yield a phonon - induced friction in a very wide range , @xmath157  ns@xmath34 , if the coverage is varied between 1.0 and 0.85 .",
    "as pointed out in section i , the quartz - crystal microbalance measurements by krim _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for thin xe films on ag(111 ) show that the slip time @xmath158 exhibits a characteristic dependence on xe coverage ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "close to one monolayer , the slip time reaches a minimum of about @xmath159  ns and then increases to about 2.0  ns within a coverage range of less than 0.3  monolayers . in this section",
    "we focus on this coverage range ( roughly the `` compression region '' ) since it provides the most challenging aspect of the data .",
    "the interpretation of the slip time at submonolayer coverages in terms of simulations based on small repeated cells is less reliable because they do not account for the formation of islands .",
    "also , the presence of defects and steps which are not included in the theory then plays a larger role . on the other hand , beyond full monolayer coverage , the observed slip time shows a much weaker coverage dependence related to additional phonon dissipation in the partly filled second monolayer .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is stated that the minimum of @xmath0 corresponds to the uncompressed monolayer at @xmath160  @xmath91 and that the subsequent steep rise reflects the suppression of intra - adsorbate phonon excitations as the xe layer becomes more compressed ( as noted above , the compressed phase is only 6  % denser than the uncompressed layer  @xcite . )",
    "this coverage assignment implies that the slip time increases ( i )  when the coverage is reduced below that of the uncompressed monolayer ; and ( ii )  when the coverage is increased beyond that of the compressed layer .",
    "however , both of these implications are implausible since in general incommensurate solid layers slide more easily than fluids  @xcite .",
    "thus , the slip time should decrease rather than increase ( i )  when the coverage is lowered below that of the uncompressed layer and ( ii )  when it is increased beyond that of the compressed layer , i.e. , when the second layer is beginning to adsorb .",
    "since absolute coverage calibration in the experiment is difficult , there exists a clearly appreciable uncertainty concerning the measured sliding friction of a monolayer .",
    "in fact , it would appear more plausible to associate the minimum of the slip time not with the uncompressed layer but with a slightly lower coverage .",
    "part of the observed steep rise of @xmath0 would then correspond to the reduction of intra - overlayer phonon processes upon reaching the uncompressed layer coverage , and the remaining rise should reflect the additional phonon reduction due to compression . the maximum of the observed slip time should approximately correspond to the fully compressed phase . according to these arguments , the uncompressed monolayer might have @xmath161  ns , giving @xmath162  ns@xmath34 .    in fig .",

    "8(b ) the measured @xmath163 as a function of coverage in the region near one monolayer where @xmath0 exhibits the characteristic positive slope .",
    "to account for the uncertainty of the measured coverage , and for the expected behavior of the sliding friction as discussed above , a shift of the data to lower coverages , by about @xmath164  monolayer , should be allowed for .     of xe on ag as a function of coverage @xmath165 for several corrugation amplitudes @xmath5 .",

    "]    the coverage dependence of @xmath1 in the range shown can be characterized by two important features : the overall magnitude and the slope .",
    "the comparison of @xmath1 with the calculated results shows that none of the functions @xmath152 obtained for different corrugation amplitudes @xmath5 provides an adequate description of the data .",
    "however , for @xmath166  mev , the calculated @xmath136 has roughly the right slope even though its magnitude at full monolayer coverage is far too small .",
    "if @xmath5 is increased to @xmath167  mev the slope of @xmath152 becomes rapidly larger than that of the measured @xmath1 while the magnitude near monolayer coverage is still too small .",
    "only when @xmath5 is increased to much larger values does @xmath136 , in the compressed phase , match the observed @xmath1 , but the slope of @xmath152 then is much larger than observed .    as shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) , a similar picture is found on ag(100 ) .",
    "although the detailed dependence of @xmath152 on the corrugation differs appreciably from the one obtained for the ( 111 ) face , near monolayer coverage , @xmath136 remains less than @xmath168  ns@xmath34 as long as @xmath169  mev , with a moderate slope for @xmath170 .",
    "only if @xmath5 is increased to 2  mev we find @xmath171  ns@xmath34 in the compressed phase .",
    "the slope of @xmath152 , however , then quickly becomes extremely large .",
    "thus , our results imply that it is not possible to simultaneously describe the magnitude _ and _ slope of the observed variation of @xmath172 exclusively in terms of phonon dissipation . only by adding an electronic friction contribution ( which in the narrow range shown in fig .",
    "8 can be assumed to be independent of coverage ) does the sum @xmath173 reproduce the measured variation of @xmath172 .",
    "the comparison with the data suggests that @xmath174  ns@xmath34 together with @xmath175  mev ( total barrier height @xmath176  mev ) provides a qualitative description of the sliding friction measured on ag(111 ) if one allows a shift of the data of 0.14  monolayer to lower coverages , of course . as discussed in section ii ,",
    "an overall single - atom electronic friction coefficient of this magnitude is in agreement with surface resistivity measurements and independent theoretical estimates .",
    "interestingly , our findings for xe / ag differ from those on kr / au . as recently shown by robbins and krim @xcite ,",
    "the kr / au qcm data up to monolayer coverage can be fitted rather well assuming negligible electronic friction .",
    "a finite electronic friction would require a correspondingly smaller substrate corrugation @xmath5 which , in turn , would yield too low values of the phonon friction at submonolayer coverages .",
    "we note , however , that the analysis of the low - coverage data is uncertain since the simulations are limited to repeated finite cells and do not include the effect of defects or steps , nor do they properly describe the formation of islands which most likely occur under experimental conditions .",
    "thus , if one focusses on the slip time in the less problematic region near monolayer coverage , i.e. , roughly @xmath177 , the analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that the inclusion of a finite electronic friction and a slightly reduced corrugation @xmath5 is not incompatible with the data .",
    "in addition , we point out that electronic friction of kr on au indeed ought to be weaker than for xe on ag for the following reasons .",
    "since the au @xmath37 bands lie only 2  ev below the fermi level , in contrast to 4  ev for ag , the larger @xmath178 hybridization diminishes the polarizability of the @xmath36 electron tails decaying into the vacuum region and thereby reduces the probability of exciting substrate electron  hole pairs via adsorbed particles .",
    "the larger work function of au ( 5.3  ev compared to 4.8  ev ) also contributes to a stiffer , less polarizable electronic density tail @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the atomic polarizability of kr is about 40% smaller than that of xe @xcite , the leading van der waals part of the friction coefficient should be much smaller than for xe on ag . for the same physical reasons",
    ", the contributions associated with the pauli repulsion and the covalency of the adatom bond should also be smaller .",
    "the overall electronic coupling of kr on au should therefore be significantly weaker than for xe on ag .",
    "thus , great caution is required when comparing electronic excitation processes on different adsorption systems even in the case of rare gas atoms on noble metal surfaces .    the comparison of figs .",
    "8(a ) and ( b ) suggests that , for the same corrugation amplitude @xmath5 , ag(111 ) yields a larger phonon friction than ag(100 ) .",
    "this trend seems at first surprising since the close - packed ( 111 ) face is generally regarded as the smoothest of the low - index faces of an fcc crystal . on the other hand , as pointed out in section iii , the potential barrier between neighboring hollow sites is @xmath60 for the ( 100 ) face and @xmath61 for the ( 111 ) face , while the total barrier between hollow sites across the substrate lattice sites is @xmath62 for the ( 100 ) face and @xmath63 for ( 111 ) .",
    "thus , the ( 111 ) surface has sharper potential maxima than the ( 100 ) face . since atoms of an incommensurate overlayer sample not only the potential minima but the entire substrate surface , it is indeed plausible that ag(111 ) causes more xe intra layer phonon friction than ag(100 ) .",
    "according to this , the topology of the substrate is a relevant feature if one want to make a comparison with the experiments .    in their analysis of an uncompressed xe layer on ag(100 ) , persson and nitzan  @xcite used @xmath103  mev and obtained @xmath179  ns@xmath34 ( for @xmath180  ns@xmath34 , they find @xmath181 ) . from this result",
    ", they concluded that the net friction at monolayer coverage is mainly of electronic origin .",
    "instead , for the same parameters , we find @xmath182  ns@xmath34 , suggesting a phonon friction roughly half as large as the electronic contribution .    on the other hand , tomassone _",
    "et al._@xcite assumed a total barrier height of 2  mev on ag(111 ) , implying in our notation @xmath183  mev .",
    "on the basis of the simulations it was concluded that phonon friction dominates over possible electronic contributions . for an uncompressed xe layer",
    ", these authors obtained a phonon friction @xmath184  ns@xmath34 , which is considerably larger than what we find for the same parameters . according to fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , in the compression region , the calculated slip time for @xmath183  mev increases extremely rapidly in agreement with our results .",
    "this increase , however , is much steeper than what is seen in the experiment .",
    "thus , a weaker corrugation , combined with a finite electronic friction might , in fact , provide a better fit of the data in this coverage range .",
    "the analysis of the submonolayer data is again more complicated for the reasons discussed earlier .",
    "we have performed molecular dynamics simulations for xe layers on ag(100 ) and ag(111 ) in order to determine the net sliding friction in the presence of a constant lateral external force .",
    "we find that @xmath1 depends sensitively on the corrugation amplitude @xmath5 of the xe / ag interaction potential and on the single - adatom microscopic friction parameter @xmath7 . for coverages",
    "approaching one monolayer , the phonon - induced contribution @xmath152 decreases rapidly , in agreement with the strong positive slope of the observed slip time @xmath0 .",
    "a detailed study of @xmath152 as a function of corrugation amplitude @xmath5 suggests that , close to monolayer coverage , it is not possible to consistently describe both the magnitude _ and _ slope of the measured @xmath163 without including a constant lateral electronic friction @xmath9 .",
    "our simulations indicate that this electronic contribution should be about 0.5 ns@xmath34 which is in qualitative agreement with surface resistivity measurements and independent theoretical estimates .",
    "the overall picture that seems to be consistent with the available information is that the rapidly varying part of the observed sliding friction is due to excitation of atomic vibrations within the overlayer and that single - site electronic friction processes contribute a roughly coverage - independent background . for a fully compressed xe layer ,",
    "phonon dissipation is weaker than the electronic friction .",
    "as the coverage is reduced , however , phonon processes rapidly become important and eventually , near the minimum of the observed slip time , dominate over the electronic dissipation channel .    in summary",
    ", even though both experimental and theoretical results on sliding friction of xe on ag have inherent uncertainties , our analysis indicates that both mechanisms phononic and electronic dissipation do contribute .",
    "the relative weight of these channels depends strongly on coverage in the crucial region near a full monolayer .",
