    "this article is in honor of alexander `` sasha '' soifer s sixtieth birthday .",
    "i have known sasha for about twenty years now ; i first met him when i competed in his colorado math olympiad in 1988 .",
    "i remember that he teased me about looking even younger than i was ( and also about my poor grades in school ) , but when we talked about mathematics he always spoke to me as his peer .",
    "we could speak a common language and share our curiosity and passion for solving problems .",
    "professor soifer has solved many outstanding math problems , but posed many more .",
    "he has composed most of the problems for twenty - five ( and counting ) colorado math olympiads , and written numerous research articles and five books about open problems in combinatorics and geometry .",
    "perhaps the most important thing that i learned from him is that we are free to ask our own mathematical questions and pursue them as far as we are able .",
    "this was a very empowering idea to me when i was young .",
    "sasha has nice taste in problems too , and tells a good mathematical story @xcite ; i have sometimes felt a little haunted by problems which i first heard from him .",
    "one problem i have always remembered for its simple and elegant statement ( and somewhat tricky proofs ) is the following , which appeared on the colorado math olympiad in 1988 @xcite .",
    "it stayed with me , and i have occasionally sat down trying to see a new solution to it .",
    "[ soif ] given five points in a triangle of unit area , there must exist some three of them forming a triangle of area @xmath0 or less .",
    "if the reader has never seen this problem , they are warmly invited to try it .",
    "the problem becomes easier if `` five '' is replaced by `` six '' or `` seven , '' but it seems to take some work to get `` five '' .",
    "solutions by alexander soifer , royce peng , and cecil rosseau all appear in the book , `` how does one cut a triangle ? '' which will soon be reprinted by springer @xcite .",
    "one wonders if this is the best possible result , and in a sense it is : it is easy to check that `` five '' can not be replaced by `` four '' .",
    "but what about the @xmath0 ?",
    "i must admit that i did not make any real progress toward proving theorem [ soif ] during the olympiad , but now i will have a ( very ) small revenge on the problem by improving @xmath4 to @xmath5 . in the spirit of sasha soifer and his wonderful journal geombinatorics",
    ", we leave the reader with some open problems as well .",
    "our main result is the following .    given five points in a triangle of unit area ,",
    "then some three of them form a triangle of area less than or equal to @xmath1 .",
    "since ratios of areas are preserved under affine transformation , we assume without loss of generality that our unit triangle @xmath6 is equilateral .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the length of one side of @xmath6 ( i.e. @xmath8{3}$ ] ) .",
    "we partition @xmath6 into @xmath9 congruent equilateral triangles of side length @xmath10 , as in figure [ fig : hund ] .",
    "label the five points by @xmath11 .     into @xmath9 congruent triangles.,width=216 ]",
    "* we use the word `` small '' to refer to triangles of area @xmath12 for the rest of the section .",
    "*    [ dist4 ] if for any pair of points in @xmath13 , @xmath14 then three of the points in @xmath15 form a small triangle .",
    "( in particular , if @xmath16 then either @xmath17 forms a small triangle for some @xmath18 , or else @xmath19 forms a small triangle . )    for any three points @xmath20 let @xmath21 denote the area of the triangle they form .",
    "the locus of points @xmath22 such that @xmath23 is a closed infinite strip @xmath15 centered on line @xmath24 , and of width at least @xmath25 since the diameter of @xmath6 is @xmath7 , the intersection @xmath26 of the complement of the strip with @xmath6 , has at most one component .",
    "the main point is that if a third point is inside @xmath15 we are done , and otherwise all three points lie in @xmath26 , and we need only check that this forces the area of the triangle they form to be less than @xmath27 .    by moving @xmath28 and @xmath29 along line @xmath24 until they intersect the boundary of @xmath6 if necessary",
    ", we only increase the width of the strip @xmath15 , so we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are both on the boundary of @xmath6 . if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are on the same side of @xmath6 then @xmath26 is a triangle with maximal area when @xmath30 , and this area is only @xmath31 , in which case we are done , so we may assume that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are on two different sides of @xmath6 .",
    "now suppose that @xmath32",
    ". then we can replace @xmath28 and @xmath29 by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , so that the line @xmath35 is parallel to @xmath24 , and @xmath36 .",
    "this results in a new strip @xmath37 and denote the intersection of @xmath37 with @xmath6 by @xmath38 .",
    "we claim that @xmath38 strictly contains @xmath26 , as follows .",
    "suppose that the distance between line @xmath39 and @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "the strip @xmath15 is parallel to the strip @xmath37 , and the width @xmath42 of strip @xmath37 is related to the width @xmath43 of @xmath15 by @xmath44 we also have by basic trigonometry that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the angle that line @xmath24 makes with the sides of @xmath6 , at @xmath29 , as in figure [ fig : seglemma ] .",
    ".,width=384 ]    the minimum of the function @xmath47 on the interval @xmath48 $ ] is attained when @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "now    @xmath51    since @xmath52 .",
    "this implies that @xmath38 contains @xmath26 , and we may assume that @xmath53 .",
    "now label the corners of @xmath6 by @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , so that @xmath28 lies on side @xmath57 and @xmath29 on side @xmath58 , as in figure [ fig : seglemma ] . if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are both greater than @xmath61 then @xmath62 , and if they are both less than @xmath61 then @xmath63 , but we are assuming that @xmath30 .",
    "so by symmetry , we assume without loss of generality that @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in particular that @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath67 and @xmath68 denote the other two intersections of the boundary of @xmath15 with the boundary of @xmath6 .",
    "note that line @xmath69 intersects side @xmath70 , and in particular @xmath26 is a triangle .",
    "let @xmath71 .",
    "then by the law of sines , @xmath72 denote @xmath73 and @xmath74 , so in particular @xmath75 .",
    "we compute @xmath76 in terms of @xmath46 by @xmath77 so @xmath78    the angles of triangle @xmath79 are @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , and applying the law of sines and a familiar formula for area of a triangle , its area is given by latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned }     it seems that this is probably a monotone decreasing function of @xmath46 on the interval @xmath84 $ ] , but we did not care to take derivatives of this function to prove it .",
    "so we instead take a slightly more indirect approach , and one that does not involve calculus .",
    "the idea is to start with the fact that @xmath85 can not be too large , which forces @xmath46 large , which in turn forces @xmath85 even smaller , etc . , and we quickly reach a contradiction to the supposition that @xmath86 .    since @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 , so @xmath89 .",
    "then if @xmath86 , @xmath90 so @xmath91    now @xmath92 , so this implies in particular that @xmath93 , and then since @xmath66 this gives that @xmath94 .",
    "plugging back in to the formula for @xmath85 gives @xmath95    we repeat the argument from before .",
    "if @xmath96 and @xmath86 , then @xmath97 , so @xmath98 .",
    "this gives in turn that @xmath99 a contradiction to the assumption that @xmath100 , since @xmath101    then we immediately have the following .    [ trihex ]",
    "if any two points of @xmath102 lie in a triangle of side length @xmath61 , or a hexagon of diameter @xmath61 , then some three points form a small triangle .",
    "these are many such triangles and hexagons suggested by our partition of @xmath6 , as in figure [ fig : trihex ] .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ] .,title=\"fig:\",width=192 ]",
    "we further restrict the possible arrangements of points by using the fact that a triangle in a parallelogram of area @xmath46 has area at most @xmath103 .",
    "( this observation is used in soifer s original proof of theorem [ soif ] . )",
    "[ parallel ] if any three points of @xmath102 lie in a parallelogram of area @xmath104 , then they form a triangle of area no more than @xmath105 .",
    "we make use of three such kinds of parallelograms , illustrated in figure [ fig : parallel ] , which we will call @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 parallelograms .    .",

    "case i is that there is a point of @xmath102 inside the central shaded triangle in figure [ fig : case1 ] .",
    "assuming case i , by the hexagon case of lemma [ trihex ] , there can be no other points in the wider shaded region in figure [ fig : wide1 ] , or else we are already done .",
    "but that leaves at least four points in the three corner white triangles .",
    "two of them must lie in the same triangle , but then by the triangle case of lemma [ trihex ] we are done .",
    "case ii is that there is a point @xmath109 in the shaded region in figure [ fig : case2 ] . by symmetry , assume that @xmath109 is in the upper triangle .",
    "there are no other points in the wider shaded region of figure [ fig : wide2 ] or we are done , by the hexagon case of lemma [ trihex ] .",
    "there is at most one point in the top white triangle , and so there are at least three points in the lower white region .",
    "the case of no points in the top triangle and four in the bottom is easy to dispense with by using lemma [ trihex ] .",
    "so assume that there is one point , @xmath110 , in the top triangle",
    ".     lies in one of the three shaded triangles .",
    "assume that @xmath109 in the top triangle.,width=192 ]    now @xmath111 and @xmath112 are all in the lower white region of figure [ fig : case2 ] . they can not all be in the lower two strips , or we are done by the parallelogram lemma with a @xmath113-parallelogram , so there is at least one point @xmath114 on the third or fourth row , by symmetry assume it is in the triangle on the left , as in figure [ fig : case22 ] .",

    "we break the outer strip into three diamond and trapezoid shaped regions , figure [ fig : case32 ] .",
