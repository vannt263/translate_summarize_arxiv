    "this paper is a major revision of our earlier work@xcite on holographic space - time ( hst ) models of inflation . in it",
    "we have incorporated the lessons we have learned about the origin of locality in our work on scattering theory and black holes in minkowski space@xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we ve had to revise some of our earlier estimates of parameters , but have obtained a major increase of clarity and coherence , and extended our model to include the reheating era , which was previously obscure in hst .    among the main new results in this paper we have    *",
    "the number of e - folds is fixed at the bound@xcite given by the present value of the cosmological constant ( c.c . ) .",
    "more precisely , the range of scales over which our model predicts a nearly scale invariant fluctuation spectrum ranges from the size of the cosmological horizon , @xmath0 to the size of the inflationary horizon @xmath1 multiplied by the ratio of the frw scale factors @xmath2 between the present , and the end of inflation . * the reheat temperature of the universe is fixed in terms of the inflationary hubble scale , the size of primordial scalar fluctuations and the density of black holes in an early phase of the universe , which is dominated by a dilute black hole gas . for typical high scale values of these parameters",
    "we have @xmath3 gev . *",
    "the formula for the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath4 has an extra factor of @xmath5 , compared to the corresponding formula @xmath6 for queft inflation .",
    "the explanation of this factor is simple . in hst ,",
    "the curvature fluctuations @xmath7 are of order @xmath8 while in queft models they are smaller by a factor @xmath9 .",
    "the numerical significance of this remark is mitigated both by the fact that in hst @xmath10 so that @xmath11 is not too small , and the fact that we do not yet know how to calculate the  order one \" coefficient @xmath12 in the formula @xmath13 , from the hst model .",
    "* the approximate @xmath14 symmetry postulated in our previous work is identified explicitly and connected to the @xmath15 symmetry identified in our model of the pre - inflationary @xmath16 era . during the inflationary era , the hamiltonian of our system is a generator @xmath17 of @xmath14 , identified in each horizon volume with the @xmath18 generator of @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath19 subgroup , which commutes with @xmath17 is an exact symmetry of the formalism , and we argue that , after a few e - folds of hst - inflation , the density matrix of the system is invariant under this @xmath20 subgroup and approximately under the full ds group .",
    "* once they come into the horizon , individual horizon volumes behave like black holes and their fluctuations are fluctuations of the mass and angular momentum of these black holes , which contribute to scalar and tensor fluctuations respectively .",
    "the sizes of these curvature fluctuations are comparable and their two point functions are approximately @xmath14 invariant .",
    "the conventional scalar fluctuation in the metric is related to the scalar curvature fluctuation by an inverse factor of the slow roll parameter @xmath21 .",
    "this accounts both for its dominance over the tensor fluctuations and for the deviation from scale invariance of its spectrum .",
    "differences between predictions of hst and queft for the scalar two point function can be absorbed into the choice of the background slow roll function @xmath22 .",
    "+ the tensor tilt , by contrast , is zero in hst .",
    "an additional contribution to the primordial gravitational wave spectrum comes from decay of the black holes .",
    "it is suppressed by @xmath23 , the number of effective massless particles into which the holes decay , but might dominate over the quantum tensor curvature fluctuations if the slow roll parameter is small enough . its spatial profile mirrors that of the scalar fluctuations , and so would have a red tilt equal to that of the scalar fluctuations .",
    "either of these contributions are distinctly different from the predictions of queft models ( at least single field models ) and a measurement of the tensor two point function over a sufficiently large range of wave numbers could differentiate between the two models . * in both queft and hst models ,",
    "the combination of maldacena s squeezed limit theorem and approximate @xmath14 invariance implies that all three point functions containing a scalar curvature fluctuation are smaller than the scalar two point function by a factor @xmath24 .",
    "the two kinds of model make distinctive predictions for the tensor three point function , but the measurement of that quantity currently lies in the realm of science fiction , because the rumors from the planck and bicep2 collaborations suggest that we will soon have a firm observational bound of about @xmath25 .",
    "one of the novel features of our current presentation of hst cosmology is the necessity to distinguish , for the first time , between the time parameter of our quantum model and the usual frw time - slicing . in the cosmology of the very early universe ,",
    "there are no localized excitations .",
    "it was not necessary , and physically impossible , to distinguish between what was occurring at one point of our time slicing , and another .",
    "indeed , in the @xmath26 cosmology , called everlasting holographic inflation ( ehi ) , which we will review in section 3 , all the dof should be thought of as living on the apparent horizon of the the causal diamond of some time - like trajectory originating on the big bang hypersurface .",
    "their hamiltonian is a fast scrambler@xcite and does not behave like a local field theory on the holographic screen .",
    "none of the constraints , which define bulk localized excitations in hst , are imposed on the state of the system . as a consequence",
    "we were free to identify our quantum hamiltonian time with frw time , since , as one can see in figure 1 , the two definitions of time coincide at the position of the trajectory on the corresponding time slice .",
    "we have made a number of errors in previous presentations of hst inflation , by trying to continue making this identification . instead , as one can see by referring to fig .",
    "1 , the time slices in our qm refer to hyperbolae which interpolate between two null cones with a small proper time difference between their tips . far away",
    "events on these time slices , are seen as they were a long frw time in the past .",
    "this distinction will be important in section 4 .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    throughout this paper , we will be utilizing the prescient view of general relativity invented by ted jacobson@xcite and expanded upon by others@xcite .",
    "fields and field equations are the hydrodynamic equations of quantum systems obeying the bhgfsb@xcite entropy / area relation between the hilbert space associated with a causal diamond and the area of that diamond s holographic screen .",
    "these equations , like all hydrodynamic equations , should be quantized only when studying low lying bulk localized excitations of quantum gravitational systems with a unique ground state .",
    "string theory in asymptotically flat and ads space - times _ does _ have a unique ground state , and this accounts for the success of effective field theory methods in that context .",
    "as we ll see , quantized effective field theory is misleading in the very early universe .",
    "classical field equations on the other hand , are valid for the quantum system in high entropy states where hydrodynamic averages are useful coarse grained descriptions . in our attempt to model the universe , we will describe quantum models , and then fit lorentzian geometries to their hydrodynamics .    in section 2 .",
    "we will give a brief review of our work on minkowski and ds space - times .",
    "notable features will be the identification of horizon entropy with low energy dof not captured by the local excitations of quantum field theory .",
    "localized states are in fact constrained states of these dof , and their energy is defined in terms of the constraints , and conserved asymptotically because it enforces an infinite number of constraints on an infinite causal diamond .",
    "the hst model has a clear description of both particle and black hole states , and the transitions between them .",
    "section 3 . is a review of the ehi cosmology and its approximate @xmath15 symmetry .",
    "the frw description of this system is a good description in the limit of large causal diamonds and the real system has no singularity .",
    "section 4 .",
    "is the core of this paper .",
    "it describes the inflationary model , which we believe is relevant to the universe we observe .",
    "we derive bounds on the maximum temperature of the universe , which are related to the values of inflationary parameters .",
    "this model makes it very explicit that one _ must _ choose low entropy initial conditions in order to have local excitations in the universe .",
    "further constraints come from insisting that the local excitations are more complex than a few large black holes or the radiation from their decay .",
    "we call this excuse for the low entropy initial conditions a _ topiks - thropic _ explanation , from the greek word",
    "_ topiks _ for _ local_. we show that more refined versions of this argument put an upper bound on the reheat temperature of the universe in the hst model in terms of parameters characterizing the inflationary era .",
    "we also argue that in this framework the number of e - folds is essentially given by an upper bound we announced some time ago@xcite . in this section",
    "we also give a brief review of observational signatures of this model .",
    "a more comprehensive paper about the predictions for two and three point functions of fluctuations will appear shortly@xcite .",
    "section 4 . also contains brief comments about baryogenesis in the hst model .",
    "our bound on the reheat temperature allows many conventional low energy mechanisms for baryogenesis , but rules out high scale leptogenesis .",
    "we also point out the possibility of producing the baryon asymmetry during the era of black hole decay by applying anthropic arguments to the statistics of black hole decay .",
    "thermodynamic averages of the decay products are symmetric , but this allows for the possibility of unlikely histories , which produce an anthropically selected asymmetry if the model has no microscopic mechanism for baryogenesis .",
    "anthropic arguments in hst cosmology are complicated , and differ significantly from model independent arguments of this type , or those based on the string landscape .",
    "they will be covered in future work .",
    "section 5 .",
    "is our conclusion , and recapitulates the basic structure of the model in a way which uses a minimum of matrix model formalism .",
    "the basic idea of the model of this paper is very simple . if we take the hst point of view that physics is done separately along different time - like trajectories , and that most of the degrees of freedom in a finite causal diamond are inaccessible to local near - geodesic observers inside the diamond , then a universe containing localized excitations must have finely tuned initial conditions .",
    "the minimal fine tuning for a given amount of matter has the matter appear as a dilute gas of black holes .",
    "a universe with a phase dominated by a normal gas of matter or radiation will only evolve from a fairly uniform black hole gas .",
    "absolute uniformity is impossible since the individual black holes are chaotic quantum systems with finite entropy , @xmath27 .",
    "there are fluctuations of their mass and angular momentum of order @xmath28 , and these are fluctuations in the scalar and tensor components of the weyl tensor .",
    "reheating of the universe comes from black hole decay , and the reheat temperature is related to the entropy of the individual black holes , and thus to the size of inflationary fluctuations .",
    "the fact that black holes that enter the horizon just before the onset of c.c .",
    "domination of our universe , have to be isolated quantum systems with entropy @xmath27 , implies that the universe had to undergo inflation up to a conformal time halfway between the big bang and the ultimate ds horizon .",
    "the black holes that come into the apparent horizon of a trajectory , as it expands , are composed of the thermalized horizon degrees of freedom of individual horizon volumes of a slow roll cosmology . in field",
    "theory models of inflation , all of these dof are frozen into a unique adiabatic ground state , whereas in hst they are independent thermalized systems , which wander chaotically through a large hilbert space of states .",
    "in our opinion , the theory of scattering in quantum gravity should be based on representation theory of the generalized super - bms algebras ( gsbms)@xcite , on the conformal boundary of minkowski space .",
    "this is discussed in the appendix .",
    "the generators of this algebra are spinors @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an in or outgoing momentum at null infinity , and @xmath31 labels the spectrum of the dirac operator on compact internal dimensions , with an eigenvalue cutoff .",
    "when we retreat from the conformal boundary to a causal diamond with a finite area holographic screen , we use the holographic principle / covariant entropy conjecture@xcite as our guide . the hilbert space which is the smallest representation of the appropriate deformation of the gsbms algebra ,",
    "must be finite dimensional .",
    "the obvious deformation , the only one that preserves rotation invariance , is to restrict @xmath32 to sections of the spinor bundle on the sphere , which are sums of dirac eigen - sections with a bound on the eigenvalue .",
    "this is the same as an angular momentum cutoff and the resulting variables are sections of the spinor bundle over the fuzzy sphere .",
    "thus , in a finite causal diamond , of size @xmath33 , the gsbms generators become @xmath34 matrices @xmath35 with anti - commutation relations @xmath36_+ = \\delta_i^j",
    "\\delta^a_b z(p , q ) .\\ ] ] this is supplemented by commutation relations for the  wrapped brane charges \" @xmath37 with themselves and the fermionic generators , that close on a finite dimensional superalgebra .",
    "the smallest representation of this super - algebra , for fixed values of @xmath38 , must be unitary , finite dimensional , and generated by the action of the fermionic generators on a single state , and is called the _ pixel hilbert space_. the @xmath39 matrices @xmath40 will be the objects from which we construct the hamiltonian .    at null infinity ,",
    "the generators @xmath41 are constrained to vanish at finite @xmath42 unless @xmath42 is contained in a finite set of spherical caps of finite opening angle on the sphere .",
    "these define jets of particles .",
    "the @xmath43 generators are allowed to be non - vanishing everywhere , except in annuli surrounding those caps .",
    "they represent the possibility that soft particles are emitted or absorbed , with vanishing energy in any finite solid angle , but non - zero total energy through the sphere at infinity .",
    "representations of the algebra satisfying these constraints are called _ jet state representations_. the finite diamond version of the jet state constraint is the requirement that @xmath44 of the matrix elements of all the @xmath45 vanish when applied to a jet state , with @xmath46 .",
    "the subscript on @xmath47 denotes the fact that they are built from the @xmath34 @xmath48 variables .",
    "we can arrange the non - vanishing matrix elements as @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "the large block represents the zero momentum particle states in the @xmath51 limit , while the smaller blocks are the energy bearing jets .",
    "most of the area of the screen is covered by ",
    "zero \" energy stuff , while energy emerges from a finite number of cones of small opening angle .",
    "correspondingly , we write a hamiltonian @xmath52 t hooft scaling guarantees that the second term vanishes as @xmath53 , while the first sum can be written as the sum of bilinears in the fermions which converges to the momentum as the @xmath54 at fixed ratio and with @xmath55 .",
    "the polynomial @xmath42 is of finite , @xmath33 independent , order .",
    "it will be constrained by the requirement that scattering amplitudes be lorentz invariant , but we do not yet know how to implement those constraints .",
    "note that the second term in @xmath56 is invariant under @xmath57 acting on the variables @xmath35 . in the limit",
    ", this converges to a group containing the group of area preserving mappings on the sphere .",
    "the terms involving particles will be chosen to be localized in cones of finite opening angle , and break this invariance .",
    "hamiltonians with area preserving invariance do not preserve the local differentiable structure of the sphere and will not behave like local field theory . instead",
    ", following sekino and susskind@xcite , we conjecture that the hamiltonian is a fast scrambler . for our purposes",
    "it is not necessary to believe the strong conjecture that all such hamiltonians are fast scramblers .",
    "we need only a sufficiently rich choice of polynomials to have this property , that we are able to also impose the constraints of lorentz invariant scattering amplitudes .",
    "the subtlety of the correlated limits above suggests the wisdom of doing everything in an extremely large but finite causal diamond of size @xmath58 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath59 acts on the matrix elements of @xmath60 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "its form , and the choice of initial state in this tensor factor of the hilbert space are constrained by consistency with the hamiltonians @xmath63 of other trajectories . at time",
    "@xmath64 we consider an initial state satisfying the jet constraint above ( with @xmath65 ) . at time",
    "@xmath66 the variables corresponding to some of the small blocks will be in @xmath67 .",
    "those that are not , will be in @xmath63 for some other values of @xmath68 .",
    "the labels @xmath68 label a sampling of trajectories , rich enough to constrain the dynamics completely .",
    "they form a topological lattice with the topology of a cauchy surface , which we will always take to be that of flat three space .",
    "consistency between the two quantum systems at different values of @xmath68 is achieved by putting a copy of @xmath69 , with appropriate modification of the number , sizes , and angular positions of the small blocks , into @xmath70 .",
    "this strategy is successful as long as the positions are sufficiently far away from each other in the geometry defined by causal relations . as a consequence ,",
    "the system has , roughly , a local structure similar to that of a quantum field theory .",
    "one can argue@xcite that this leads to a computation of many amplitudes in terms of time ordered feynman - like diagrams .",
    "those amplitudes are ones in which the outgoing state of a causal diamond of size @xmath33 satisfies of order @xmath71 constraints with @xmath72 , so that it can be interpreted in terms of jets of particles .",
    "the factor of @xmath73 in front of the hamiltonian , combined with t hooft scaling , insures that this is likely when @xmath33 is large .",
    "@xmath56 controls the evolution of degrees of freedom inside the causal diamond between the times @xmath66 and @xmath74 , as well as @xmath75 and @xmath33 . since the part of the hamiltonian that can change block size has a small operator norm , particles will , to a large extent , retain their identity . in some smaller nested causal diamond",
    ", this will no longer be true , but the outgoing state may still be constrained and be interpretable as a new set of particles .",
    "such an amplitude may be visualized as an @xmath76 particle vertex , localized in the small diamond in which the blocks changed size and angular orientation .",
    "the consistency conditions then allow us to string together these vertices into feynman diagrams .",
    "on the other hand , it may be that the final state has no constraints on its variables , in some fairly large diamond of size @xmath77 .",
    "the fast scrambler nature of the hamiltonian , will bring the system to equilibrium .",
    "this is in fact the inevitable result when the number of constraints @xmath71 , which we would like to impose to define a particle state , is of order the total number of variables @xmath78 .",
    "that is what happens , precisely when @xmath79 .",
    "the initial state is then very special , and the hamiltonian will act to change it into a more generic state .",
    "we ve thus derived the parametric form of the formula for the schwarzschild radius as a function of energy .",
    "one can also show that newton s law has the right scaling as a function of energy and impact parameter , and that , with the appropriate generalization of the model , all of this works in any space - time dimension@xcite .",
    "if we imagine following up on the creation of this equilibrium state in a larger causal diamond , it will behave like a localized object , since the constraints on the @xmath80 variables in that diamond are not removed by the creation of the  black hole \" .",
    "assuming that the trajectory we are following is at rest in a frame not too different than the center of mass frame of the collision then this object will move slowly w.r.t .",
    "the trajectory .",
    "it indeed has all of the characteristics we expect of a black hole .",
    "the outgoing matrix state will be of block diagonal form , but the small block of variables , of size @xmath77 , will not be in the pure state that would characterize a particle of that energy , but in a maximally uncertain state .",
    "the probability that those variables could be in a state where the @xmath81 matrices were further block diagonalized into @xmath82 , with @xmath83 , and the @xmath11 block in a time independent pure state is of order @xmath84 , since that is how many constraints would have to arise spontaneously .",
    "this is a thermal distribution of particle energies , with temperature @xmath85 .",
    "we want to emphasize that these properties are quite universal in the class of models we study , as long as the order of the polynomial @xmath42 is @xmath86 ( this bound is necessary to get newtonian scaling of large impact parameter scattering @xcite ) .",
    "most of these models are not acceptable theories of quantum gravity , because they wo nt satisfy the hst consistency conditions for trajectories with arbitrary relative velocity , which imply in particular that in the correlated @xmath87 limit , scattering amplitudes become lorentz invariant .",
    "experience from string theory shows us that we can expect these constraints to be pretty strong , and most particle spectra will not be consistent with them .",
    "what s remarkable is that many qualitative features of quantum gravity are contained in _ all _ of these models , so that we can address many questions without solving all the constraints .",
    "we d like to end this section with a brief comment about the theory of stable ds space@xcite . in the limit of large ds radius",
    ", we propose that it consists of keeping @xmath58 finite , and letting the system evolve forever with the hamiltonian @xmath88 .",
    "this describes a single horizon volume of the global ds manifold .",
    "the system obviously evolves to an equilibrium state , with infinite temperature , if we start from a generic state of the large block in the block diagonal form of the constrained initial state .",
    "all constraints are erased in a time of order @xmath89 , since the characteristic energy scale of the hamiltonian is @xmath90 and the system is a fast scrambler . ] .",
    "localized excitations which were not put in as a part of the initial conditions , will , after the scrambling time , appear only as short lived thermal fluctuations .",
    "the probability of such an excitation , with energy @xmath91 is @xmath92 , which is thermal at the ds temperature .",
    "this is because what we call @xmath91 is a count of the number of constraints that define a particle state .",
    "this explanation of the ds temperature as a result of a relation between energy and constraints in a maximally uncertain system , is evident in the formula for black hole entropy in ds space .",
    "the presence of a black hole decreases the entropy of ds space , and when its schwarzschild radius is @xmath93 the ds radius , that decrease is precisely a boltzmann factor .",
    "the hst construction of a space - time contains an infinite set of quantum systems , describing physics as seen from an infinite collection of time - like trajectories .",
    "we will be describing a big bang universe , which ends in a ds final state , with hubble radius given by @xmath95 .",
    "it will be an frw model and we may take the topology of the initial value surface at the big bang to be that of flat space . as in the discussion of minkowski space",
    ", we introduce a sampling of trajectories defined by a lattice on that hypersurface .",
    "only the topology of that lattice is relevant , since geometry will be defined by causal structure , which is incorporated in the quantum dynamics .",
    "it is convenient to think about a cubic lattice , and label its points by a discrete three vector @xmath68 .",
    "we will be describing an frw universe and each trajectory will have the same quantum system attached to it .",
    "there will be no fine tuning of initial conditions of each individual quantum system required , in order to impose homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy make it easy to impose the fundamental consistency conditions of hst , namely that the density matrices describing shared information along any two different trajectories , are unitarily equivalent to each other .",
    "we think it s likely that , given the chaotic dynamics we will prescribe for individual trajectories , no inhomogeneous solutions to the consistency conditions exist . in the next section we will introduce models that have local excitations , and find plenty of inhomogeneous and consistent models .",
    "the prescription along an individual trajectory , is that the hamiltonian at time @xmath96 planck units from the big bang can be written    @xmath97    in the ehi model , it will turn out that we do not need to specify @xmath98 , except that it is constructed , at each time , from variables that do not appear in @xmath99 .",
    "the first part of the hamiltonian , called @xmath100 depends only on the bilinear matrices @xmath45 constructed from the spinor variables @xmath35 , with indices running over @xmath101 values .",
    "it is the trace of a polynomial of some fixed order , but with coefficients that are chosen randomly at each time .",
    "susskind and sekino@xcite conjecture that even with fixed coefficients such a hamiltonian is a fast scrambler .",
    "it randomizes a perturbation applied to a small number of variables in a time @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the characteristic time scale of the hamiltonian ( the inverse of the operator bound , if the eigenvalues are distributed relatively uniformly ) .",
    "when the coefficients vary randomly with time , the results of @xcite make it almost inevitable that the hamiltonian will be a fast scrambler .",
    "the overlap rules are defined as follows : if two points are separated by @xmath104 lattice steps , then at time @xmath96 the overlap hilbert space is generated by the sub - algebra of operators @xmath48 , which were acted on by @xmath105 .",
    "our assumption that the initial state on the full hilbert space , and sequence of time dependent hamiltonians , are identical for all lattice points , guarantees that the density matrix of this subalgebra of operators at time @xmath96 is identical for both systems .",
    "homogeneity and isotropy invariant .",
    "it also appears in the overlap rules because the overlap condition depends only on the number of lattice steps between points . as @xmath104 gets large the locus of all points @xmath104 steps away from a given one becomes dense on a tilted hypercube . in the distance defined by causality , the geometry of this hyper - cube is spherical .",
    "since we view the lattice as only a sampling of the possible trajectories in space - time , this is evidence for exact isotropy in the overlap rules , which is certainly what one sees for the quantum mechanics of each individual trajectory . ]",
    "reduce this infinite set of conditions to a rather simple one .",
    "we insist finally that , as @xmath106 the hamiltonian approach that of a @xmath107 cft , with central charge @xmath108 .",
    "the uv cutoff on the cft is proportional to @xmath109 and the length of the half line on which it lives proportional to @xmath110 .",
    "we assume @xmath111 so that the one dimensional volume is large in cutoff units and the cft description makes sense . in a generic state , the expectation value of the energy is thus @xmath112 , while the entropy is @xmath113 .",
    "the volume of the region inside the horizon , in the emergent geometry defined by our causal rules is @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the energy density , entropy density , and time are related by @xmath115 these are the friedmann equation , and equation of state of an frw geometry with @xmath16 .",
    "we see jacobson s principle in action : the hydrodynamic relations of a quantum system obeying the area law are equivalent to einstein s classical field equations .",
    "the quantum excitations of the system have nothing to do with the quantized einstein equations .",
    "notice also that the singularity of the classical cosmology is a fake .",
    "the emergent geometry is an approximate notion , valid only for large @xmath96 , while the singularity occurs near @xmath116 , where the actual quantum system has a perfectly finite description .",
    "note that there is no curvature term in the friedman equation , a fact which is linked to our ansatz of approximate scale invariance for the large @xmath96 hamiltonian .",
    "this is a property of the model , rather than a fine tuning of the choice of initial state . in the @xmath16 model , homogeneity , isotropy and flatness",
    "are consequences of the choice of hamiltonian , plus a random choice of initial state .",
    "the model has no local excitations .",
    "there is a simple modification of this model in which we declare the full hilbert space at each site to have finite dimension @xmath117 .",
    "we then propagate the system forever with the hamiltonian @xmath56 , which is approximately that of a cft .",
    "we make an asymptotic change of time coordinate by going to a conformal frame where @xmath118 ( this is the analog of the change between frw and asymptotic static coordinate times for an asymptotically ds frw space - time ) .",
    "we modify the overlap rules so that points that are more than @xmath33 steps apart on the lattice have no overlap hilbert space , no matter how long a time has passed .. the asymptotic model on a single site is the same as that we used for a single horizon volume of ds space in the previous section .",
    "however , we now have many copies of that volume , which do nt communicate with each other .",
    "this model , called the ehi model , depicts a transition from a non - singular big bang , with planck scale horizon radius , through an approximately scale invariant @xmath16 phase , to a de sitter phase with horizon radius @xmath1 .",
    "the coarse grained hydrodynamics of this model is described by the frw scale factor @xmath119 , with time measured in planck units .",
    "the only local excitations in this universe are thermal fluctuations at late time .",
    "although the hilbert space contains states produce a particle spectrum like that in our universe . ] which resemble the current , pre - de sitter phase of the universe we inhabit , they are so improbable that not even anthropic arguments can redeem them .    in the next section",
    "we will build a model which does produce local excitations , by fine tuning initial conditions .",
    "we will see that that model must undergo an inflationary phase in which it resembles a  coarsely woven lattice \" of trajectories in the ehi model , consisting of trajectories which have no overlap whatsoever in everlasting inflation .",
    "these are separated by @xmath33 lattice steps on the original lattice . in the holographic inflation model , these",
    "disjoint horizon volumes are put together into a single hilbert space as the horizon expands .",
    "the model of the previous section provides the clue for constructing a model of inflation .",

    "however , a model consisting of a whole set of decoupled systems , each with entropy @xmath122 , and the same hamiltonian , is precisely our description of multiple horizon volumes of the ehi model .",

    "its tilt is the same as that of the scalar fluctuations .",

    "we ve argued that , apart from the intrinsic fluctuations in black hole mass and angular momentum , the black hole distribution is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "however , fluctuations grow in a matter dominated universe , which is certainly the correct characterization of the immediate post - inflationary phase of the hst cosmology . in order to distinguish it from the matter dominated phase that recently ended , we call this the dilute black hole gas ( dbhg ) era of the hst universe .",

    "the baryon asymmetry , which is also subject to anthropic pressure , depends on the dark matter asymmetry .",

    "we have not yet sorted through this complicated tangle , but it is certainly within the realm of possibility that the anthropic constraints will give an adequate explanation of why our universe obtained a non - zero asymmetry in some approximate global quantum number despite the improbability of non - zero asymmetry in the ensemble of all possible worlds .",
    "it s also possible @xcite that cp violating effects involving both the black hole and frw metrics , could generate baryon and/or pyrma - baryon asymmetries directly .",

    "first , black holes form bound states , and coalesce to form larger black holes , which are more stable . furthermore",
    ", black holes that are not bound together will be driven outside each other s horizon in a time of order @xmath301 .",
    "black hole decay in such a universe will mostly consist of a slow dribbling of radiation , followed by a single explosion .",

    "we saw that consistency between the bulk and matrix model pictures forces us to choose the equation of state @xmath320 for the frw metric that gives a coarse grained description of the process .",
    "this was the description of the entrance of black holes into the horizon of a particular trajectory , from the point of view of that trajectory .",
    "however , we must also consider consistency with the description of a time - like trajectory , which goes through the space - time position of the black hole at the time that it enters the horizon of the first trajectory .",
    "the observer along that trajectory is experiencing inflation , because its _ in _ hilbert space has maintained constant entropy @xmath122 for proper times between @xmath33 and the spatial distance , in inflationary hubble units at which the black hole crosses the horizon .",

    "the matrix model we ve presented , gives a complete mathematical formulation of a system whose qualitative behavior was described in the last few paragraphs .",
    "indeed , it gives many such formulations , depending on the choice of the commutation relations of the fermions and the polynomials @xmath323 .",
    "we believe that , among all these models , only a very limited set will give completely consistent theories of quantum gravity , when we impose the constraints that come from requiring that we obtain consistent descriptions of overlapping causal diamonds for trajectories that are in motion relative to each other . in this paper",
    ", we ve only described trajectories that are at rest in the same frame .    to conclude",
    ", we d like to summarize both the major differences between the model of this paper , and our previous work , and to compare our model to standard queft inflation .",
    "the present model is based on our understanding of locality in asymptotically flat space , whereas our previous work tried to construct an explicit lattice field theory . there",
    ", the approximate @xmath14 symmetry , which explains the shape of scalar fluctuations , was postulated , whereas here it arises naturally from the combination of the @xmath15 invariance of the @xmath16 model and the @xmath192 that is built into the definition of our variables .",
    "we also understand it to act only on the part of the hilbert space that is outside the horizon .",
    "this connection between inflation outside the horizon ( which implies via the hst consistency conditions that inflation occurred also in the past of a given trajectory ) and the appearance of a roughly homogeneous dilute black hole gas inside the horizon , is also new .",
    "this goes along with the new realization that once physics is local , we must differentiate between the equal time surfaces of the hst model , and the frw surfaces .",
    "the picture of the post inflationary universe as a dilute black hole gas harks back to some of our earliest work on inflationary cosmology , gives us a rather constrained model of reheating , and explains the physical origin of the scalar and tensor fluctuations as mass and angular momentum fluctuations of the black holes , which are viewed as finite chaotic quantum systems .",
    "this should lead to a determination of the absolute relative normalization of the two kinds of fluctuation .",
    "apart from the fact that hst is a well defined quantum mechanical model , its main advantage over queft models of inflation is that its choice of initial conditions is much less fine tuned , and that the fine tuning is justified as the minimal amount necessary in order to get local physics in an asymptotically ds universe .",
    "more precisely , the adjective minimal applies to models in which there are only a few localized black holes inside the cosmological horizon , but we feel that it s pretty obvious why a more homogeneous distribution of black holes is necessary for the existence of complex organization .",
    "another advantage of hst over queft models is that the model is much more highly constrained , and depends on a very small number of parameters .",
    "all hst models satisfy the approximate @xmath14 invariance , which we demonstrated in @xcite is sufficient to explain all extant cosmological data , when combined with maldacena s general theorems about soft scalar fluctuations .",
    "there is a wide variety of queft models , which can explain all sorts of peculiar forms for non - gaussian fluctuations .",
    "while many models are ruled out by current data , the number of surviving models is large .",
    "we believe that it will be very difficult to falsify the general idea of queft inflation without measuring the tensor three point functions .",
    "finally let us note that the decoherence of the fluctuations and their interpretation as classical statistical fluctuations of the weyl tensor follow from the black hole interpretation in hst : black holes are large chaotic quantum systems and their mass and angular momentum are collective coordinates .",
    "in queft models , the fluctuations originate as quantum fluctuations in a unique state , separated , according to the adiabatic argument , from the rest of the hilbert space by a gap large compared to the hubble frequency .",
    "one needs special arguments to justify their decoherence .",

    "<S> this paper is a major revision of our previous work on the hst model of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the local fluctuations of the metric with fluctuations of the mass and angular momentum of black holes , and show that the consistency conditions in hst for a single trajectory to see more and more of a homogeneous distribution of black holes , imply that the system outside the horizon is undergoing inflation : small systems of equal entropy , are not in causal contact . </S>",
    "<S> homogeneity then requires that the initial trajectory underwent inflation that expanded the black hole radius into our current horizon . </S>",
    "<S> the low entropy of the initial state of the universe is explained by the fact that this is the maximal entropy state , which has long lived localized excitations , and which can form structures more complex than black holes . </S>",
