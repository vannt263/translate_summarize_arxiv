    "noble liquids such as argon ( or xenon ) can act as targets for wimps ( weak interacting massive particles ) , the most popular candidates for dark matter in the universe .",
    "these elements have high scintillation yields and are also suitable for charge detection because of their relatively low ionization potentials .",
    "both ionization and scintillation light can be detected @xcite .",
    "argon ( @xmath7ar ) is cheap compared to xenon and is therefore competitive for large volumes , in spite of its contamination by the @xmath8ar @xmath9-emitter .",
    "here we present measurements on gaseous argon done while developing the scintillation light read out of a 1 ton liquid argon tpc to search for dark matter ( ardm , @xcite ) .",
    "the light yield and the mechanism for the luminescence of noble gases and liquids are comparable to that of alkali halide crystals @xcite and are described in the literature for dense gases @xcite and liquids @xcite .",
    "fundamental to the scintillation process is the formation of excited dimers ( excimers ) which decay radiatively to the unbound ground state of two argon atoms .",
    "figure [ aremission ] shows schematically the two mechanisms leading to light emission in argon , excitation and ionization .",
    "excitation leads through collisions with neighbouring atoms to neutral excimers ar@xmath10 which decay radiatively into two argon atoms .",
    "ionization leads to the formation of charged excimers which are neutralized by thermalized electrons ( recombination luminescence ) .",
    "both processes are strongly pressure and density dependent . for gaseous argon at room temperature and normal pressure ,",
    "at which we operate here , excitation dominates @xcite , while recombination luminescence becomes important at high pressures or in liquid .",
    "the argon excimers are created in three nearly degenerate spin states , two singlets ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and a triplet ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 state can not decay radiatively by parity conservation , and the @xmath13 is expected to have a much longer lifetime than the @xmath12 since it has to decay into two spin-0 argon atoms .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath13 states decay radiatively by emitting vuv photons in a @xmath1410 nm band around 128 nm .",
    "these photons are not absorbed by atomic argon and can therefore be detected .",
    "light at higher wavelengths ( mostly in the near ir ) is also produced from transitions between highly excited argon atomic states .",
    "the production times of the triplet and singlet states and their production ratio vary with argon density and also depend on the type of projectile , e.g. electron , @xmath0-particle or fission fragment @xcite .",
    "however , the decay times are not affected .",
    "the time constants of the singlet and triplet states have been measured in dense gases with 160 kev electrons @xcite .",
    "the production time of the singlet excimer is around 40 ns at 3 atm , decreasing with increasing gas pressure , and the mean life is about 4 ns . the mean life of the triplet excimer state is substantially larger , 3.2 @xmath2 0.3 @xmath4s .    in liquid argon the mean lives scatter in the range between 4 and 7 ns for the singlet state , and between 1.0 and 1.7 @xmath4s for the triplet state .",
    "the triplet to singlet production ratios are 0.3 , 1.3 and 3 for electrons , @xmath0-particles and fission fragments , respectively ( for a compilation see ref .",
    "the large difference in time constants between singlet and triplet states is unique for argon among noble gases and can be used to suppress background in wimp searches .    in this paper",
    "we present evidence for the ( non - radiative ) destruction of triplet states in gaseous argon by traces of air @xcite .",
    "the population of the triplet states decreases exponentially with a shorter decay time than measured with clean argon gas .",
    "the reduced light yield is presumably due to collisional destruction of the long - lived triplet state by impurities such as water molecules .",
