    "the achievement of laser cooling @xcite resulted in an unprecedented control of atomic ensembles , which led to a dramatic evolution of atom - based sensors such as atomic clocks , inertial sensors , and magnetometers @xcite .",
    "these sensors are today state - of - the - art devices and their improvement is a major technological issue .    however , the cold atom cloud as the source of the sensors needs to be reloaded after each measurement cycle .",
    "this limits the maximum repetition rate of the sensor and creates a sampling of the measured variable .",
    "it is , for example , responsible for the dick effect that is nowadays limiting optical lattice clocks @xcite .",
    "the development of continuous cold atomic sources can thus lead to important improvements and new designs of atom interferometers .",
    "continuous atomic sources are often associated with an atomic guide that is usually realized with a magnetic potential @xcite and loaded from a cold atomic source .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a magnetic field may be a limitation for interferometric applications , and particularly for magnetometers .",
    "here we propose an all - optical method to create a continuous source of guided cold atoms loaded directly from a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ]  ( a ) .",
    "it relies on an atom - diode effect @xcite that permits the atoms to enter into the guide but forbids them to escape .",
    "the method uses optical pumping to both keep the atoms in the guided state after loading and spin - polarize the sample in a given zeeman sublevel .",
    "the guide thus provides a collimated and continuous source of polarized cold atoms suitable for atomic sensors .",

    "the 1529  nm beam induces a position - dependent differential light - shift on the transition at 780  nm .",
    "the detuning of the 780  nm beam is chosen to generate a state - dependent dipole force which implements the atom diode .",
    "for an atom in @xmath1 , the potential in the transverse direction is a double barrier , that is , a pipe , due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem.,width=321 ]    the article analyses the main physical processes involved in the proposal implementation and is organized as follows . in a brief presentation of the method we explain how light - shift engineering in a three - level system leads to the continuous extraction of atoms from a mot into an optical guide .",
    "we then model the forces for a three - level atomic system in a ladder configuration ( @xmath2-system ) : from the master equation in the lindblad form , we derive the optical bloch equations and introduce the dressed state picture which simplifies the description of the internal state dynamics to rate equations . since the guide performance is limited by the heating rates , we quantify the various diffusion processes that an atom experiences when it propagates along the guide .",
    "we exhibit a possible implementation with @xmath0rb atoms , but the method can be generalized to any alkali - metal atom .",
    "we finally use the theoretical results previously obtained to simulate the stochastic trajectories of atoms in the guide solving langevin - like equations . from these simulations",
    "we estimate the performance of the guide and show that the proposed method is viable .",
    "we now give a brief overview of how the guide is generated and continuously loaded , exhibit the various physical effects involved , and explain how they combine .",
    "the main idea is to coaxially overlap two beams [ fig .",

    "[ fig : schema ]  ( c ) for @xmath0rb atoms , the first beam at 780  nm is tuned to the blue of the @xmath3 transition , and to the red of the @xmath4 transition .",
    "the 780  nm field then realizes a state - dependent dipole potential : repulsive for atoms in @xmath1 and attractive for atoms in @xmath5 .",
    "the second beam , placed on the red of the @xmath6 transition at 1529  nm , induces a differential light - shift on the transition at 780  nm @xcite .",
    "therefore , the 780  nm radiation is far - detuned at the center of the beams , resulting in a strong reduction of the dipole potential . as a consequence ,",
    "the potential is created only at the periphery of the beam , producing a state - selective barrier with a pipe shape due to the cylindrical symmetry of the problem . moreover",
    ", the differential light - shift also strongly lowers the spontaneous emission rate inside the guide , reducing the heating rate and thus increasing the guided distance of the atoms .    due to the differential light - shift , the 780  nm light is resonant ( or nearly resonant ) with atoms in @xmath5 at some position inside the guide .",
    "therefore , atoms in @xmath5 from the mot can pass through the guide barrier before being repumped into the barrier - sensitive state @xmath1 by the 780  nm light .",
    "in other words , an atom can enter the guide but can not leave it : this is the atom - diode effect which continuously extracts atoms from the mot and fills the guide .",
    "we will see in sec .",
    "[ sec : doubly_closed_trans ] that a proper choice of polarizations for the optical beams drives closed transitions that maintain the atoms in the guided state @xmath1 while optically pumping and polarizing the atomic sample .    for the atom - diode effect to occur the 780  nm radiation is not far - detuned from the @xmath7 transition and spontaneous emission will play an important role in the dynamics of the system .",
    "the scattering induces a heating of the sample that limits the guided distance for a given transport velocity .",
    "moreover , the occupation of the excited states is not negligible near the barrier so that the dipole force of the 1529  nm light contributes to the overall potential .",
    "these effects may modify the nave description introduced above .",

    "it must be noted that all the heating processes result from the same stochastic source : the spontaneous emission . as a consequence , the processes are not only correlated but synchronized since the change of the recoil and dipolar forces occurs simultaneously .",
