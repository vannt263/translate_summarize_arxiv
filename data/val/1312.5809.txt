    "graphene and related nanostructured materials have attracted much interest in solid state physics recently due to their bidimensional character and a host of peculiar properties  @xcite . among them , the investigation of the magnetic properties in graphene is one of the fascinating topics , as no @xmath0 and @xmath1 elements are necessary in the induction of magnetism in comparison with the usual magnetic materials .",
    "theoretical predictions and experimental investigations have revealed that a nonmagnetic defect such as an impurity or a vacancy can induce the non - trivial localized magnetism  @xcite .",
    "similarly , a random arrangement of a large number of vacancies which are generated by the high - dose exposure of graphene to strong electron irradiation  @xcite can also induce magnetism theoretically  @xcite .",
    "these studies not only have the fundamental importance , but also open a door for the possibility of application in new technologies for designing nanoscale magnetic and spin electronic devices .    on the other hand ,",
    "the topological insulating electronic phases driven by the spin - orbital ( so ) interaction have also attracted much interest recently .",
    "the kane - mele model for the topological band insulator is defined on the honeycomb lattice  @xcite which is the same lattice structure as graphene .",
    "possible realization of an appreciable so coupling in the honeycomb lattice includes the cold fermionic atoms trapped in an extraordinary optical lattice  @xcite , the transition - metal oxide na@xmath2iro@xmath3  @xcite and the ternaty compounds such as liause and khgsb  @xcite .",
    "topological band insulator has a nontrivial topological order and exhibits a bulk energy gap with gapless , helical states at the edge  @xcite .",
    "these edge states are protected by the time reversal symmetry and are robust with respect to the time - reversal symmetric perturbations , such as non - magnetic impurities .",
    "it is shown that a vacancy , acting as a minimal circular inner edge , will induce novel time - reversal invariant bound states in the band gap of the topological insulator  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , it is also shown that the so coupling suppresses the edge magnetism induced in the zigzag ribbon of the honeycomb lattice in the presence of electron - electron interactions  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is expected that the so coupling would also affect the local magnetism in the bulk induced by vacancies .    in this paper , we study theoretically the effects of the so coupling on the local magnetism induced by a single and a multi - site vacancy on the honeycomb lattice , based on the kane - mele - hubbard model where both the so coupling and the hubbard interaction between electrons are taken into consideration .",
    "this model has been extensively studied to explore the effect of the strong correlation on the topological insulators @xcite . making use of the self - consistent mean field approximation",
    ", we calculate the local spin moments and their distribution around the vacancies . for a single vacancy , we find that the main effect of the so coupling is to localize the spin moments to be near the vacancy , so that it will enhance the local spin moments . for a large stripe vacancy by taking out a chain of sites from the lattice , we find that the so coupling tends to suppress the counter - polarized ferrimagnetic order induced along the zigzag edges , because of the open of the so gap . as a result , in the case of the balance number of sublattices ( with even number of vacancies ) ,",
    "the so coupling will suppress completely the counter - polarized ferrimagnetic order along the upper and lower edges .",
    "while , in the case of the imbalance number of sublattices ( with odd number of vacancies ) , a ferrimagnetic order along both edges exists because additional zero modes will not be affected by the so coupling .    we will introduce the model and the method of the self - consistent mean - field approximation in sec.ii . in sec.iii and iv , we present the results for a single vacancy and a multi - site vacancy , respectively . finally , a brief summary will be given in sec.v .",

    "when vacancies are introduced , the hoppings between the vacancy and the nearest neighbors and the on - site interaction on that vacancy are subtracted from the overall hamiltonian .",
    "hence the corresponding number of the lattice sites is @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of vacancies .",
    "the total number of electrons @xmath25 is fixed to be at the half - filling ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the hubbard interaction term is treated with the self - consistent mean field approximation , so that we will obtain an effective single - particle hamiltonian where the electrons interact with a spin - dependent potential , @xmath27 and the overall mean field hamiltonian @xmath28 is then given by , @xmath29 after diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath28 , we can determine the occupation number @xmath30 at each site with different spins using the eigenvectors of @xmath28 , and this process is carried out iteratively until a required accuracy is reached .",

    "emerges as shown by the solid line , which corresponds to the localized states induced by the vacancy  @xcite . after turning on the so coupling , such as that for @xmath35[see fig.2(b ) ] , we can see that an energy gap opens for those lattice sites far away from the vacancy  @xcite , so that now a u - shape ldos near the fermi level occurs . in this way ,",
    "the mid - gap peak is enhanced noticeably because the decay rate of the localized states into the continuum is reduced largely due to the open of the energy gap .",

    "as discussed above , the local magnetism is determined by the spin - split localized states induced by the vacancy , and it is the hubbard interaction @xmath41 to split the spin - degenerate states . because the open of the gap due to the so coupling will decrease the decay rate of the localized states into the continuum , so it will enhance the spectral weight of the localized states[see also fig .",

    "however , the effect of the so coupling on local magnetism is quite different for the case of an odd number of vacancies .",

    "a remarkable feature of the graphene ribbon with zigzag edges is that it has a flat band localized on the zigzag edge@xcite .",
    "an important effect of this flat band is that a counter - polarized ferromagnetic order along the upper and lower edges will be induced when the hubbard interaction between electrons is included  @xcite . in view of this , we plot the single - particle spectra for the systems with the stripe vacancy without the hubbard interaction in fig.[loc6](a ) and ( b ) for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . each energy level is labeled with @xmath76 in order to indicate that the energy level with @xmath77 is occupied by electron . for the systems without so coupling , we find that there are four near - degeneracy localized states [ red circles indicated by arrows in fig.[loc6](a ) and ( b ) ] which is near the fermi level for both @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    ". these states will have the same effect as the flat band in the zigzag ribbon when a suitable hubbard @xmath41 is turned on .",
    "so , a counter - polarized ferrimagnetic order as shown in fig.[loc4](a ) will emerge .",
    "however , we note that there are two additional zero modes for @xmath75 relative to @xmath74 , due to the imbalance between the sublattices ( @xmath78 )",
    ". these zero modes will induce extra spin moments on both edges , which counteract the antiparallel moments on the lower edge .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath75 , only the ferrimagnetic order on the upper edge appears . after turning on the so coupling , those localized states [ blue squares indicated by arrows in fig.[loc6](a ) and ( b ) ] are pushed away from the fermi level due to the open of the so gap . thus",
    ", as shown in fig.[loc4](b ) , a small hubbard u is not enough to induce the counter - polarized ferrimagnetic order on the upper and lower edges .",
    "however , the zero modes originating from the imbalance of sublattices are not affected by the so coupling [ fig.[loc6](b ) ] .",
    "so , the additional ferrimagnetic order on both edges induced by these zero modes will remain for @xmath75 .",
    "in a summary , we have studied the local magnetism induced by vacancies on the honeycomb lattice based on the kane - mele - hubbard model .",
    "it is shown that the so coupling tends to localize and consequently enhances the local magnetic moments near a single vacancy . furthermore , along the zigzag edges formed by a chain of vacancies , the so coupling will suppress completely the counter - polarized ferrimagnetic order along the edges . therefore , the system will not show any local magnetism in the case of even number of vacancies . for an odd number of vacancies , a ferrimagnetic order along both edges exists and the total magnetic moments along both edges will increase .",

    "<S> the local magnetism induced by vacancies in the presence of the spin - orbital interaction is investigated based on the half - filled kane - mele - hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice . using the self - consistent mean - field theory </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the spin - orbital coupling will enhance the localization of the spin moments near a single vacancy . </S>",
    "<S> we further study the magnetic structures along the zigzag edges formed by a chain of vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the spin - orbital coupling tends to suppress the counter - polarized ferrimagnetic order on the upper and lower edges , because of the open of the spin - orbital gap . as a result , in the case of the balance number of sublattices </S>",
    "<S> , it will suppress completely this kind of ferrimagnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> but , for the imbalance case , a ferrimagnetic order along both edges exists because additional zero modes will not be affected by the spin - orbital coupling . </S>"
