    "when a photoexcited molecule is placed in a polarizable solvent , it will relax its energy in presence of potentially strong interactions with its bath , i.e. , its nearest neighbor solvent molecules .",
    "this interplay manifests itself already in the properties of the steady state by the observed stokes shift between the absorption and emission energies of the solute , which typically reflect the rearrangement of the caging solvent around the excited solute @xcite . a pioneering femtosecond transient absorption laser study of photoexcited no in solid ne and ar rare gas matrices was capable of extracting mechanistic movements of the caging rare gas atoms in combination with model calculations @xcite , but in liquid media this connection to the actual solvent movements in response to the creation of an excited state dipole moment is inherently difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "quantum chemical calculations have meanwhile advanced and now permit simulating the dynamic response inside a box containing the excited molecule itself and a certain number of moving solvent molecules . in this way , simple ions @xcite , but also more complex molecules , such as aqueous [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 could be treated@xcite . in a recent experiment ,",
    "haldrup _ et al .",
    "_ have attempted to tackle this phenomenon exploiting combined x - ray spectroscopies and scattering tools @xcite .",
    "this picosecond time - resolved experiment used x - ray absorption spectroscopy to unravel the electronic changes visible around the fe @xmath2 absorption edge .",
    "they occur concomitant to the geometric structural changes already extracted from the extended x - ray absorption fine structure ( exafs ) region @xcite .",
    "the latter monitors the molecular changes around the central fe atom .",
    "while these studies only shed light on the excited molecular dynamics within itself , the recent study combined x - ray emission spectroscopy ( xes ) with x - ray diffuse scattering ( xds ) to obtain a picture of the internal electronic and structural dynamics ( via xes ) simultaneously with the geometric structural changes in the caging solvent shell . one surprising result from this experimental campaign",
    "has yielded information about a density increase right after photoexcitation ( i.e. , within the 100 ps time resolution of that study ) , which was fully in line with the md simulations of ref .  .",
    "they calculated a change in the solvation shell between the low spin ( ls ) ground and high spin ( hs ) excited state , which resulted in the expulsion of  on average  two water molecules from the solvation shell into the bulk solvent .",
    "this showed up in the xds data as a density increase in the transient xds pattern , and even the quantitative analysis extracted an average density increase due to about two water molecules expelled into the bulk solvent per photoexcited [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "this success has triggered the current theoretical study : if it is becoming possible to experimentally gain new insight into guest - host interactions in disordered systems like aqueous solutions , would it be possible to eventually understand the influence of guest - host interactions on the dynamic processes occurring within the solute ? indeed ,",
    "aqueous [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 is an ideal model system for several reasons .",
    "internally , it undergoes several ultrafast transition processes involving correlations within the @xmath3 orbitals : after photoexcitation from the @xmath4a@xmath5 ground state into its singlet excited metal - to - ligand charge transfer state ( @xmath4mlct ) , it rapidly undergoes an intersystem crossing into the triplet manifold ( @xmath6mlct ) within about 30 fs @xcite , and leaves the mlct manifold in 120 fs @xcite .",
    "femtosecond xas studies observed the appearance of the finally accessed hs @xmath7t@xmath8 state in less than 250 fs @xcite , which was also confirmed by an ultrafast optical - uv transient absorption study @xcite .",
    "a very recent femtosecond xes study revealed the existence of a metal - centered intermediate electronic state on the fly before the system settles into the hs state @xcite .",
    "this electronic and spin - switching process sequence starts from the ls ground state which is formed by six paired electrons in the lower t@xmath9 level .",
    "then , the cascade proceeds to the hs excited state . there , the six electrons are distributed via t@xmath10e@xmath11 and both e@xmath11 electrons with parallel spins to two of the four t@xmath10 electrons .",
    "overall , @xmath12 in the hs state ( against @xmath13 in the ground state ) results .",
    "such a transition is very common in fe - ii based spin crossover ( sco ) compounds , but little is understood about both the internal dynamic processes involved as well as about the possible influence of the solvent on this rapid spin - switching scheme .",
    "indeed , the initially excited mlct manifold should interact with the caging solvent molecules , but currently little is known about the actual dynamic processes .",
    "this mystery motivates the calculations performed in this work .",
    "here we investigate the energy relaxation dynamics in photoexcited aqueous [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 theoretically in order to provide a new view of the short - time guest - host interactions in this complex sequence of relaxation .",
    "the water molecules close to the compound are polarized and a hydration shell of bound water is formed . on the one hand , this hydration shell may shield the complex from polarization fluctuations provided by the bulk water . on the other hand",
    ", it may also act as an additional source of polarization fluctuations and thus enhance the relaxation process . to be specific here",
    ", we consider the case of [ fe(bpy)@xmath0@xmath1 in water @xcite .",
    "the set of states which are involved in the cascade of transitions from the ls to the hs state is schematically shown in fig .",
    "also , several intermediate vibronic states of the complex are relevant @xcite .",
    "an initial photoexcitation ( green solid arrow ) brings the fe - ii complex from the ground state of the ls configuration into an excited vibronic state of a configuration of the metal - to - ligand - charge - transfer ( mlct ) state .",
    "the photoexcitation at @xmath14 nm provides an energy of about @xmath15 ev or @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "more precisely , a state on the @xmath4mlct manifold is initially excited , but rapidly undergoes an intersystem crossing into the triplet manifold ( @xmath6mlct ) within about 30 fs @xcite .",
    "the two manifolds are similar in their vibrational frequencies and correspond to the skeleton mode of bpy in the mlct configuration .",
    "this mode has a rather high vibrational frequency of @xmath18 @xmath17and its vibrational ground state has an energy of about @xmath19 @xmath17 .",
    "hence , the photoexcitation populates mostly the vibrational state @xmath20 with a quantum number @xmath21 .",
    "the relaxation out of this state can now occur via two alternative relaxation pathways .",
    "elements of these pathways are known , but the path which is eventually chosen by the system is not fully understood in detail up to present . on the one hand , the relaxation can proceed via energetically lower - lying vibrational states on the mlct manifold , i.e. , following @xmath22 ( the blue path , see the sequence of blue arrows in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the available mlct states form a broad manifold of metal - centered states @xcite . from the mlct ground state , the energy",
    "could be transferred to a vibrationally excited state of one of the metal - centered triplet states ( @xmath23 t ) . in the t state ,",
    "the fe - n bond length increases , such that the fe - ii complex expands by about @xmath24  .",
    "this molecular configuration has a vibrational energy gap @xcite of @xmath25 @xmath17which corresponds to a vibrational mode of the fe - n bond .",
    "it is experimentally well - established that the transfer from the mlct manifold to the intermediate t states occurs in about @xmath26 fs .",
    "the system would reach the vibrational ground state of the t configuration via a sequence of vibrational relaxation steps . from the t - vibrational ground state , the energy",
    "would be transferred to a vibrational excited state of the hs configuration .",
    "its hs vibrational ground state has an energy of @xmath27 @xmath17 .",
    "the vibrational energy gap is again determined by a vibrational mode of the fe - n bond and is estimated @xcite as @xmath28 @xmath17 .",
    "it is established that the transfer from the t to the hs state occurs within @xmath29 fs @xcite . along with this",
    "occurs another rearrangement of the compound which results in an effective growth of the molecule ( and thus somewhat the caging cluster ) of @xmath30  .",
    "after vibrational relaxation in the hs state , the system would reach its hs ground state configuration within @xmath31 fs @xcite .",
    "the second possible pathway ( the red path , see the sequence of red arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) would start in a highly excited vibrational state on the mlct manifold as before . without performing a vibrational relaxation transition within the mlct manifold",
    ", it directly yields to a highly excited vibrational state on the t manifold within @xmath26 fs and continues again without a vibrational relaxation transition to another highly excited vibrational state of the hs configuration within @xmath29 fs .",
    "from there , the complex relaxes into the hs ground state via vibrational transitions and removal of the corresponding energy into the hydration shell and bulk water within @xmath31 fs @xcite .    the final hs to ls relaxation occurs in @xmath32 ps @xcite .",
    "both scenarios would allow the system to reach the hs electronic manifold within roughly @xmath33 fs via several intermediate states .",
    "the initial energy is intermittently stored within molecular vibrations but finally transferred out of the complex into the solvent environment .",
    "the fe - ii complex expands , since the fe - n bond lengths increase , when the compound is excited from the ls to hs state . here",
    ", we assume that fe - n stretching and bending modes are dominant .",
    "what is unknown from the experimental perspective , is the vibrational life times of the intermediate vibrational electronic states ( blue and red question marks in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "for instance , if the highly excited vibrational states on the mlct manifold live long enough such that the transfer to the t - manifold can occur within @xmath26 fs , the system would most likely choose the red pathway .",
    "on the other hand , if the highly excited vibrational states on the mlct manifold rapidly relax within @xmath26 fs to the mlct ground state , the system would prefer to follow the blue relaxation pathway .",
    "sketch of the energies of the ls , mlct , t and the hs state ( not to scale ) .",
    "the details are given in the text .",
    "the two possible relaxation pathways are indicated by the sequences of the red and blue arrows .",
    "the unknown life time of the vibrational states is indicated by the blue question mark and is determined in this work.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to decide this question from a theoretical point of view , we follow a simplified model description which is accurate enough such that a clear qualitative answer follows . for this",
    ", we establish a model of a quantum mechanical two - state system which describes a bath - induced vibrational relaxation from an excited vibrational state to the ground state on a generic manifold .",
    "we thereby model the environmental polarization fluctuations including the effects of a hydration shell in terms of a refined onsager model combined with a debye relaxation picture @xcite .",
    "a crucial aspect here is that we include the bulk solvent _ and _ the hydration shell on the same footing in terms of a continuum description of environmental gaussian modes .",
    "this model allows us easily to modify the radius of the solvated complex ( taken as a sphere in this work ) and the thickness of the surrounding hydration shell . within this simplified model ,",
    "we determine the energy relaxation rate for several representative vibrational modes including the fe - n stretching and bending modes in dependence of the fe - n bond length and the hydration shell thickness .",
    "technically , we use numerically exact real - time path integral simulations on the basis of a fluctuational spectrum which is highly structured and far from being ohmic .",
    "such a `` slow '' bath reflects the similar physical time scales on which the vibrational relaxation transitions within a vibrational manifold and the polarization fluctuations of the surrounding water occur .",
    "the highly non - ohmic form ( see below ) of the bath spectral densities a priori calls for the use of an advanced theoretical method beyond the standard markov - approximated dynamical redfield equations .",
    "sketch of continuum dielectric models for the complex - bound - water - solvent system , see text for details .",

    "@xmath38 is the dielectric constant of the vacuum inside the cavity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we find vibrational energy relaxation times on generic manifolds in the range of @xmath39 ps depending on the fe - n bond lengths and the hydration shell thickness . for this , we tune the vibrational frequencies which are determined by the curvature of the manifolds over a relevant parameter range .",
    "we can determine the modes with fastest energy relaxation which dominates the energy relaxation dynamics of the fe - ii complex since internal energy redistribution is likely much faster .",
    "most importantly , we observe that the vibrational relaxation times within a manifold are much longer than the typical time scales of a few hundred fs during which the hs state is formed .",
    "two effects are competing here .",
    "a complex with a smaller radius of the solvation sphere brings the environmental fluctuations spatially closer to the complex and thus results in a faster decay .",
    "however , in turn , the stronger fe - n bond results in larger mode frequencies .",
    "overall , the calculated life times of the vibrationally excited states in the ps regime clearly show that the vibrational life times are much longer than the complex overall needs to reach the hs state , which are less than @xmath33 fs .",
    "thus , we can conclude that the energy relaxation basically occurs via the `` red pathway '' after the complex has reached the hs state and vibrationally relaxes into the ground state .",
    "to determine the life time of the excited vibrational states , we formulate a minimal model in form of a quantum two - level system which is immersed in its solvent environment ( model 1 ) and is , in addition , surrounded by a hydration shell ( model 2 ) .",
    "after expansion of the fe - ii complex , the stretching and bending modes @xcite involving the fe - n bond change their respective vibrational frequency .",
    "we investigate their relaxation dynamics independently and use the spin - boson hamiltonian @xcite as a minimal model , i.e. , @xmath40 here , the pauli matrix @xmath41 contains the ground state @xmath42 and the excited state @xmath43 between which we investigate the relaxation transitions .",

    "we consider several representative fe - n stretching and bending modes with the frequencies @xmath55 60 , 120 , 150 , and 250 @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , we use a continuum description of the solvent ( bulk ) water and the hydration shell following gilmore and mckenzie @xcite . the key quantity to characterize the environment , i.e. , the spectral distribution @xmath56 of the fluctuations , is determined in terms of the standard onsager model of polarization fluctuations of the solvent water molecules .",

    "hence , the calculated relaxation times for model 2 will be faster than for model 1 .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the vibrational life times on the mlct manifold are much larger since there the spectral weight of the solvent environmental modes around the frequency of @xmath18 @xmath17   is strongly suppressed ( in fact , we do not consider the vibrational relaxation around this frequency in this work ) .",

    "this splitting in discrete time steps is exact in the limit @xmath107 , i.e. , when the discrete time evolution approaches the limit of a continuous evolution .",
    "for any finite time slicing , it introduces a finite trotter error which has to be eliminated by choosing @xmath106 small enough such that convergence is achieved . on the other side ,",
    "the environmental degrees of freedom generate correlations being non - local in time .",
    "we want to avoid any markovian approximation at this point and take these correlations into account on an exact footing .",
    "we may , however , use the fact that for any finite temperature , these correlations decay exponentially quickly on a time scale denoted as the memory time scale .",
    "the quapi scheme now defines an object called the reduced density tensor .",

    "the calculated relaxation times or life times of the excited state vary from @xmath115 to @xmath116 ps . for a larger complex radius , the life time increases as expected since the prefactor of the spectral density decreases proportional to @xmath117 .",
    "this reflects the assumption that the effective transition dipole sits in the center of the sphere and an increasing complex pushes the solvent fluctuations further away .",
    "this reduces their strength due to the distance dependence of the dipolar coupling .",

    "we observe that under the assumption of equal strengths of the coupling to the environmental fluctuations , all fe - n stretching and bending modes in the ls and hs state exhibit quite similar vibrational life times on the order of 5 ps .",
    "the vibrational energy gap has been modified from @xmath124 to @xmath121 @xmath17and all cases show similar results .",
    "an increased radius of the complex results in a larger life time since the fluctuating solvent molecules are moved further outside .",
    "a finite hydration shell thickness reduces the vibrational life times noticeably .",

    "<S> we study the relaxation dynamics of photoexcited fe - ii complexes dissolved in water and identify the relaxation pathway which the molecular complex follows in presence of a hydration shell of bound water at the interface between the complex and the solvent . </S>",
    "<S> starting from a low - spin state , the photoexcited complex can reach the high - spin state via a cascade of different possible transitions involving electronic as well as vibrational relaxation processes . by numerically exact path integral calculations for the relaxational dynamics of a continuous solvent model , we find that the vibrational life times of the intermittent states are of the order of a few ps . </S>",
    "<S> since the electronic rearrangement in the complex occurs on the time scale of about 100 fs , we find that the complex first rearranges itself in a high - spin and highly excited vibrational state , before it relaxes its energy to the solvent via vibrational relaxation transitions . by this </S>",
    "<S> , the relaxation pathway can be clearly identified . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the life time of the vibrational states increases with the size of the complex ( within a spherical model ) , but decreases with the thickness of the hydration shell , indicating that the hydration shell acts as an additional source of fluctuations . </S>"
