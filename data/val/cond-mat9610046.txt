    "the knowledge of the formation energy of solid surfaces is of obvious importance for surface physics and technology . given the difficulties of a direct measurement of the surface energy , accurate calculations @xcite of this quantity play a relevant role in surface science .",
    "the standard method for calculating the surface energy @xmath0 is to evaluate the total energy of a slab of the material of interest ( generally with a thickness between 5 to 15 layers ) and to subtract from that the bulk energy obtained from a separate calculation .",
    "this procedure singles out the total energy contribution due to the presence of the surface .",
    "it is based on the general and intuitively appealing expression @xmath1 with @xmath2 the total energy of a @xmath3-layer slab and @xmath4 the bulk total energy ; the limit is approximated in practice by the @xmath3th term .",
    "the factor of 1/2 accounts for the two surfaces of the slab .",
    "a central but often underestimated problem with this approach is what value should be chosen for the bulk energy . while at first sight this point might be dismissed as irrelevant , in a recent paper@xcite boettger pointed out that any difference between @xmath4 and the change in @xmath5 with slab thickness will cause the calculated surface energy to diverge linearly with @xmath3 .",
    "thus , increasing the slab thickness _ must _ sooner or later lead to unacceptable results , because the bulk energy from a separate calculation will never exactly equal the slope of the slab energy vs @xmath3 .    in ref .",
    ", severe errors incurred by this standard approach were reported .",
    "their unusual magnitude was presumably due to a technical matter , namely the use of two completely different methods for calculating the bulk and surface properties .",
    "thus , the practical importance of the divergent behavior of the surface energy remains unassessed for state - of - the - art methods , which carefully treat bulk and slab systems in the same way .",
    "the aim of this paper is to supply such an assessment .",
    "in particular , the natural objection to boettger s argument would be that , when using the same calculational method in a technically consistent way to obtain both bulk and slab quantities , this problem would simply not show up .",
    "we show in this paper that this is not the case : the proper choice of the bulk energy according to boettger s principle is an important issue in surface energy calculations even when the bulk and slab systems are handled consistently within accurate methods such as fp - lmto , pseudopotentials - plane waves , or such .",
    "further , we compare different approaches to remedy the problem , presenting what seems to be the best solution . as modern calculations advance to study more subtle surface effects and employ thicker slabs , these results will become increasingly relevant .",
    "in this section we present _ ab initio _ surface calculations demonstrating that the surface energy is not only formally , but also practically divergent for accurate calculations . to this end , we compare results obtained by the standard approach with those calculated using an alternative procedure suggested by boettger @xcite and with a modified approach to be described below .",
    "it will become clear that the latter method is the most reliable by a wide margin and should be prefered for high - accuracy applications .      for the standard methods , we first of all use eq .",
    "( 1 ) whereby the bulk energy was obtained from a well - converged bulk calculation ( see below ) .",
    "we also considered the slightly modified version @xcite @xmath6 whereby the total energies needed are that of a slab containing @xmath3 layers ( @xmath2 ) and that of a @xmath7-atom bulk supercell consisting of the slab plus the vacuum space between the slabs filled with atoms ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "in other words , the weighted energy of the filled slab is taken as bulk energy . using eq .",
    "( [ tre ] ) , many sources of difference between the slab and bulk energies can be eliminated since the same supercell is used for the bulk and slab systems , albeit at the cost of an increase in computational effort . for this approach",
    ", we used @xmath9 with n up to 11 .",
    "boettger@xcite suggested the following method to avoid the divergence problem . for each slab thickness @xmath3 , pick as bulk energy @xmath4 the differential increase in the slab total energy upon addition of one layer of material : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "this formula has the obvious merit of using only slab - related quantities , making no reference to separately - calculated bulk energies .",
    "consequently , the calculated surface energy should not suffer from the divergence problem of eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) .",
    "the price to pay is that of repeatedly calculating total energies for slabs of increasing thickness . at slight variance with ref .",
    ", we use @xmath12 in order to maintain inversion symmetry in our slabs .    as a fourth alternative",
    ", we note that as @xmath3 becomes large and convergence is approached , the definition of the surface energy in eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) implies that @xmath13 this straight - line behaviour is already dominant for very thin slabs .",
    "this can be understood on the basis that the energy of a given atom is determined to a large extent by its nearest - neighbor environment @xcite .",
    "the most straightforward way to extract the quantity @xmath4 is to fit a straight line to all the slab total - energy data vs.  @xmath3 ( except for the thinnest slabs ) and to take its slope .",
    "this value is then used in eq .",
    "( [ uno ] ) .",
    "this procedure uses the same data needed in boettger s suggested approach .",
    "it is free of the divergence problem because no separately - calculated bulk energy enters .",
    "the only uncertainty in the procedure is the assumed onset of the straight - line behaviour ; indeed , apart from the very thinnest slabs , the error bar in @xmath4 when starting the fit at different @xmath3 s in the range from 3 to 13 is @xmath140.01 mry ( see also table i below ) .    as a test case , we report results for the surface energy of pt ( 001 ) , evaluated by the four schemes just described .",
    "total energies were calculated within the local density approximation to density functional theory @xcite , using the all - electron full - potential lmto method @xcite .",
    "slab thicknesses of up to 15 layers , and a vacuum spacing equivalent to seven bulk layers were used .",
    "the slabs were left unrelaxed in the ideal fcc geometry .",
    "the technical ingredients ( basis set , k - point summation , etc . ) are given in ref . .",
    "figure [ f - uno ] shows the calculated surface energies as function of slab thickness when the four described methods are used .",
    "the two approaches using a separately - calculated bulk energy [ eqs .",
    "( [ uno ] ) and ( [ tre ] ) ] are shown by open circles and triangles , respectively .",
    "both evidently suffer from the divergence problem , shown by the linear decrease as the slabs are made thicker .",
    "boettger s approach ( taking the bulk energy as differential increase of the slab energy , filled diamonds ) does indeed give a surface energy which does not have this systematic linear behaviour .",
    "unfortunately , it shows large oscillations which decrease only very slowly as the slab is made thicker .",
    "if only these three techniques were available , the best legitimate conclusion would be that the surface energy lies somewhere between 1.21 and 1.26 ev / atom .",
    "this is an uncertainty of 5% even though slabs as thick as 15 layers were considered .",
    "the fourth technique ( fitting a straight line to the @xmath2 data to obtain @xmath4 ) is shown by filled squares . in comparison to the other approaches , very fast convergence to a stable value",
    "is achieved .",
    "we can now accurately determine the calculated surface energy to be 1.246 ev , a value which is numerically stable to within 0.5 mev .",
    "this reduces the uncertainty to below 0.1% . in order to suppress the weak residual oscillation , we averaged over the last three points in the curve : however , the deviations from the average are below 0.5 mev .",
    "( for completeness , in table i we list the raw data for the slab total energies , where a constant offset of 36800 ry / atom was subtracted for convenience , and the bulk energies obtained by linear fittings to @xmath2 vs. @xmath3 starting at different values of the slab thickness @xmath3 . )",
    "our main point here is that one should be wary of the standard technique ( which uses a separately calculated bulk energy ) even for calculations of high accuracy .",
    "we can compare the bulk energy as deduced from the slope of the @xmath2 data ( @xmath15  ry ) with that from the well - converged bulk crystal calculation ( @xmath16  ry ) , finding a difference of only 0.6  mry  @xmath17  ev . despite this very small discrepancy",
    ", the undesired linear behaviour in the calculated surface energy is already prominent for thicknesses of eight or more layers .",
    "the accumulated bulk error for the ( typically used ) slab thickness of around seven is already uncomfortably large , namely 4.2  mry @xmath18  ev . optimistically going to thicker slabs",
    "would soon lead to unacceptable values of the surface energy .",
    "although previously calculated surface energies using the standard technique with slab thicknesses of below ten layers can be considered reasonably reliable , it is clearly important to keep the problem addressed here in mind when doing surface calculations .",
    "to some extent , the severity of the problem will depend on the calculational method used . in terms of k - points and selfconsistency iterations ,",
    "our bulk crystal energy was converged to within 0.01 mry .",
    "thus , the discrepancy in @xmath4 presumably comes from the k - point mesh for the slab , which consisted of 15 irreducible special points in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "it is highly desirable to be able to use a mesh of this typical size , independent of the exact _ ab - initio _",
    "scheme used . in this context",
    ", our conclusions apply in exactly the same way to other methods .",
    "although our suggested scheme at first sight looks like a mere numerical procedure , there is a clear theoretical background to it . the squares in fig .",
    "1 show small but definite oscillations of the surface energy as function of the slab thickness with a period of about six to eight layers .",
    "these quantum size effects are due to the finite thickness of the slab .",
    "the problem of boettger s scheme is that it artificially magnifies these oscillations by a large factor because the bulk energy is calculated from two slabs of similar thickness .",
    "a technique which exploits the overall linear behaviour of the @xmath2 data , such as ours , eliminates this problem .    finally , we point out that our tests up to now , while informative , used all the @xmath2 data up to @xmath3=15 to obtain the converged surface energy . in practice ,",
    "the aim is to use the data from slabs up to a thickness of typically 7 to 9 layers . using the same procedure as before ,",
    "this gives surface energies of 1.2456 and 1.2457 ev / atom , respectively .",
    "these values are much closer to the converged value than those of the three competing approaches . for completeness",
    ", we mention that analogous results have been obtained for al ( 001)@xcite , and rh and ir low - index faces @xcite , as will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in summary , it has been previously pointed out@xcite that the calculated surface energy will diverge with slab thickness if a bulk energy is used which is not exactly equal to the slope of the slab energy vs. slab thickness . here",
    ", we have investigated this phenomenon in the context of accurate state - of - the art computational methods which are careful to treat bulk and slab systems in the same way .",
    "the results show that the effect must be taken seriously for this type of calculation also .",
    "the problem can be easily solved by obtaining the bulk crystal energy directly as the slope of the @xmath2 data , but care should be taken to eliminate quantum size effects .",
    "this can be done by making an overall linear fit to the slab total energy as function of the thickness .",
