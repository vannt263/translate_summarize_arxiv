    "in the limit the heavy quark mass going to infinity , a new @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is number of heavy flavors ) spin - flavor symmetry appears in qcd@xcite . as a consequence , this symmetry implies that all the form factors involved in the semi - leptonic decays of @xmath2 meson can be expressed by one single universal isgur - wise function .",
    "recently@xcite , it has been argued that in the baryons containing a single heavy quark ( hereafter we shall refer to as 1hq - baryons ) the correlation between the heavy quark and one light quark is much stronger than the one between two light quarks .",
    "that is to say , the presence of a heavy diquark could be more probable than the one of a light diquark in 1hq - baryons .",
    "the main arguments are follows : the gluons that the heavy quark exchanges with light degrees of freedom are soft only for the heavy quark but are extremely hard for the light degrees of freedom ( their momenta are of order @xmath3@xcite ) .",
    "suppose that at some moment there exists some light diquark .",
    "the dynamics also contains hard gluon exchanges which have enough energy to break the binding of the light diquark , which is of order @xmath4 .",
    "if we integrate the hard gluons into the diquark to have a strong binding of the diquark and a weak interaction of it with the heavy quark , we must have a very large diquark which would loose the sense of its own use . on the other hand",
    ", the heavy diquark must be very stable , since the hardest gluons have been integrated into the diquark to build a strong binding .",
    "the remaining light diquark has not enough energy to break this binding .",
    "the similar approximation has been applied in atomic physics : the @xmath5 atom can be well approximated as a system of an electron with a @xmath6 ion .",
    "it could hardly be considered as a @xmath7 ion and a cooper pair of two electrons .",
    "some calculations@xcite have also indicated that in the 1hq - baryons the correlation of qq is always much weaker than the one of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 denotes light quarks , while @xmath10 denotes heavy quarks ) .",
    "so far , we are no fanatics of the idea and of the heuristic arguments given above , unless it could be proved from the first principles of qcd",
    ". such nonperturbative aspects of qcd are still exceedingly difficult to attack at present .",
    "we need more evidences to headaway the idea , which would lead to an interesting supersymmetry between 1hq - mesons and baryons[2 ] .",
    "fortunately , in this paper we are able to offer a method to analyze the weak decays of 1hq - baryons , which may likely trace back to the presence of the existing diquark .",
    "we shall show that the diquark , if exists , would leave its traces on a series of relations between the weak form factors of baryons .",
    "quite different relations are implied from the presumed existence of the heavy diquark or of the light diquark .",
    "so a careful analysis of the baryon s weak decay data in the future will clarify the dominant correlation in 1hq - baryons .",
    "in such an analysis a proper definition of diquark is very essential .",
    "although the idea of diquark was suggested as early as in 1966@xcite , there are still many contradictory definitions of diquark@xcite .",
    "many papers contain the assumption , sometimes hidden , that diquarks can be treated as elementary .",
    "some others state that diquarks are quasi - elementary constituents of baryons , or even assume that diquarks are not elementary at all but rather correlated states of two quarks .",
    "in this paper we shall use another definition of diquark , which would satisfy the requirement of lichtenberg@xcite : a diquark is a correlated state of two quarks and the quarks inside and outside the diquark should be antisymmetrized . to give the diquark a sense",
    "we shall also assume that the diquark spin is a well - defined quantum number .",
    "this is the case when the spin - spin interaction between the diquark and the remaining degrees of freedom is small comparing to the color force .",
    "in such a strong regime of qcd , the diquark spin is a good quantum number ( while the spin of different quark can be not a good quantum number ) .",
    "therefore , we can split the spin part of the baryon wave functions respectively .",
    "in the large limit of the heavy quark mass , we can also postulate the heavy quark symmetries for 1hq - baryons .",
    "so , the heavy diquark picture can be considered as a further step beyond the spectator quark model .",
    "such an approximation is similar to the one when we approximate an atom by an electron bound to an ion neglecting the electron - electron interaction .",
    "we shall follow the covariant bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite and show that the assumption of heavy diquark reduces the number of the weak form factors of 1hq - baryons comparing to the cases where the light diquark or the heavy quark symmetry alone are supposed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we shall briefly review the covariant bethe - salpeter formalism and the weak current induced baryon transitions . in sec.iii giving a proper definition of diquark we develop the covariant bethe - salpeter formalism for the heavy diquark - quark systems to construct the wave functions of heavy baryons . the heavy to heavy and the heavy to light baryon transitions are discussed in secs.iv and v , respectively . in sec.vi",
    "we shall discuss the results and suggest some new possibilities opened by those ones . the light diquark - quark picture of 1hq - baryons does not lead to any simplification since actually the spin decoupling of the heavy quark coincides to the one of the light diquark .",
    "within the covariant constituent quark model , the baryon bethe - salpeter amplitude is : @xmath11 where the @xmath12 s represent the quark fields and @xmath13 is a baryon state .",
    "the b - s amplitude contains the baryon - quark vertex function with quark and baryon legs .",

    "diagramatically , the b - s amplitude is represented in fig.1 .",
    "+ 3truecm    fig.1    the bethe - salpeter wavefuntions of baryons should be fully antisymmetrized under the interchange of any two quarks .",

    "represents the dirac and flavor indices @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",

    "we can allow the baryon wave function having only three arguments @xmath20 and @xmath19 .",
    "the spin - flavor part @xmath21 should be fully symmetric under the interchange of the indices @xmath22 . by help of the spin - parity projectors we can project out the irreducible states@xcite of spin @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the natural ansatz for the baryon bethe - salpeter wave functions in general is given as follows : @xmath25 here @xmath26 is a sixth - rank dirac tensor function , while @xmath27 is the spin - parity flavor projector .    at the moment we ignore the flavor - dependent part having in mind that it is determined uniquely by the spin - dependent part and it can be constructed conveniently , whenever it will be necessary . in general , the spin - parity projectors for the s - wave baryons are given as follows@xcite : @xmath28_{\\delta \\sigma } \\ ] ] @xmath29_\\rho [ ( \\not v + 1)\\gamma _ \\mu c]_{\\delta \\sigma } \\ ] ] @xmath30_{\\delta \\sigma } \\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the four - velocity of baryons .",
    "the dirac spinors @xmath32 satisfy the equation : @xmath33 the rarita - schwinger spinors @xmath34 satisfy the equations : @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 the general wave functions given in the formula ( 2.3 ) can be used to describe the light baryons . for the 1hq - baryons , it has been shown that if one of quarks becomes heavy , in the limit of the heavy quark mass going to infinity , we have the following good approximation : @xmath38 diagramatically , we can represent the 1hq - baryon- quark bethe - salpeter amplitude as in fig.2 .",

    "the number of form factors reduces from 3 to 1 as the consequence of heavy diquark hypothesis . in the heavy to light baryon transitions if the produced quark can still keep its partner the number of the form factors reduces greatly .",
    "the stability of the decaying diquark could have different reasons . in our opinion",
    "if the produced quark is still heavier than the quark outside the diquark it will be the case .",
    "anyway , the constraints on the weak form factors of these transitions would testify which diquark exists in the produced baryons .",
    "if in the heavy baryon a point - like heavy diquark does exist we should be able to indicate its existence by the structure of form factors .",
    "assuming that such a point - like structure does exit inside baryons , we can treat the diquark as an elementary local field .",
    "as the diquark is a boson and very heavy , in the limit of the heavy quark mass going to infinity we can construct an effective theory for heavy diquark following georgi , wise and carone@xcite .",
    "now the heavy boson of georgi , wise and carone has a new interpretation as the heavy diquark .",
    "it is interesting to note that in such an effective theory in the heavy quark mass limit , there is a supersymmetry between the heavy diquark and the heavy antiquark .",
    "if this supersymmetry survives the hadronic level , we can use the wigner - eckart theorem to derive the same formula as the one of georgi and carone@xcite for the matrix element : @xmath126 the @xmath127 form factors is sometimes called isgur - wise function .",
    "this result is quite different from the formula ( 2.13 ) . by the help of the gorkov identity",
    "we can transform the formula ( 6.1 ) into another form with the electric -type term containing @xmath128 and a magnetic term containing @xmath129 . comparing with the equation ( 2.13 ) , we see that an elementary heavy diquark structure leads to a magnetic form factor , while the usual hqet does not .",
    "the explanation is simple : the magnetic moment of the baryon with an elementary diquark comes from the spin of the light quark . with light diquark the magnetic moment of",
    "the baryon comes from the spin of the heavy quark , which contributes nothing to the weak form factors due to the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the heavy diquark picture give the same number of form factors for mesons and baryons .",
    "this would mean that the supersymmetry can occur .",
    "originally , supersymmetry of hadrons was proposed by miyazawa@xcite to derive some similarities between baryons and mesons as early as in 1968 .",
    "recently catto and grsey@xcitefound qcd basics for this symmetry and explained the parallelism between mesonic and baryonic regge trajectories .",
    "as the supersymmetry is broken badly for light hadrons , lichtenberg@xcite argued that the supersymmetry will become good for heavy hadrons .",
    "there are two types of supersymmetry depending on the existence of diquark .",
    "the supersymmetry of lichtenberg is associated with the light diquark .",
    "the second supersymmetry @xmath130 is associated with the heavy quark .",
    "so far , the supersymmetry in the world of 1hq - baryons occurs on two basic assumptions : the existence of diquark and the heavy quark symmetry .",
    "it seems too strict to suppose so much .",
    "but the nature is always simpler than we thought .",
    "the question is whether the heavy diquark picture is good and on which energy scale .",
    "it is very likely that the heavy diquark does exist on the same energy scale as the one of the heavy quark symmetry or even lower than that .",
    "if this is true we can expect that the supersymmetry occurs at the same time as the heavy quark symmetry",
    ".    presently , we do nt have much informations about weak decays of heavy baryons .",
    "hopefully , more data of heavy baryon s weak decays will be available in the near future to clarify our questions : which diquark picture ( heavy or light ) is the better approximation to 1hq baryons ?",
    "can diquark be approximated as a point - like object ?",
    "is there any supersymmetry between 1hq hadrons ? basing on our results a future analysis on the weak decay data of baryons will determine whether these postulations can make any sense .",
    "many thanks are due to professor f.hussain for his interest in this work .",
    "many criticisms by him has been taken into the paper and the main idea was also initiated by the work@xcite of his group .",
