    "open clusters are an ideal tool for tackling many astrophysical problems such as star formation processes , stellar evolution and dynamical evolution of stellar systems . to date",
    "there are about 1200 known galactic open clusters in the catalog of open cluster data ( lyng  1987 ; hereafter cocd ) .",
    "owing to the high quantum efficiency , good linearity and large dynamic range of modern ccds , accurate color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) of a large number of open clusters have been obtained to derive their basic physical parameters ( distance , interstellar reddening , age and metallicity ) .",
    "current understanding of the galactic disk has greatly benefited from several recent systematic ccd observations of young and old open clusters @xcite .    however , more than half of the known galactic open clusters are as yet virtually unstudied .",
    "all that we know about the majority of the open clusters are their positions and angular diameters , which are often inaccurate in many cases .",
    "to date only one third of the known open clusters have been studied in detail to derive their basic parameters . moreover , more than half of the well studied clusters belong to trumpler richness class @xmath2 and @xmath3 , while most of the unstudied clusters are classified as @xmath4 .",
    "thus , present knowledge of open clusters is considered to be heavily biased by the properties of rich open clusters .    to understand the nature of open clusters and the structure of the galactic disk as a whole ,",
    "we have started a comprehensive photometric survey of open clusters which have been little studied before , using the 1.8 m telescope at bohyunsan optical astronomy observatory ( boao ) in korea .",
    "the primary goal of the present survey is to obtain accurate cmds of the unstudied clusters using @xmath0 ccd photometry and to derive cluster parameters such as distance and age .",
    "we selected 343 clusters by the declination criterion of @xmath5 .",
    "they comprise about half of the clusters with unknown distance and age in cocd .",
    "a more detailed description of the present survey was given by @xcite .",
    "this is the second paper of our survey project . here",
    ", we present the results of the photometric survey of 12 open clusters observed during the observing runs in 1998 and 1999 . in  2 , we describe the observations and data reduction .",
    "the physical parameters of the observed clusters are presented in  3 and a brief summary and discussion are given in the last section .",
    "we observed 12 candidate clusters of the boao photometric survey in december 1998 .",
    "the basic parameters of the observed clusters @xcite are given in table 1 .",
    "the photometric observations were made using the site @xmath6 ccd camera with johnson - cousins @xmath0 filters attached to the f/8 cassegrain focus of the boao 1.8 m telescope .",
    "the pixel size of the ccd is 24 @xmath7 corresponding to 0.@xmath834 on the sky .",
    "the gain and readout noise of the ccd are 1.8 electrons / adu and 7 electrons , respectively .",
    "we have obtained images of the central @xmath9 regions of each cluster with a pair of long and short exposures for each filter .",
    "we observed several @xmath0 standard stars in landolt ( 1992 ) s catalog for the calibration of our photometry during the observing run .",
    "however , owing to non - photometric conditions and difficulty in transforming the @xmath10 colors to the standard system , we re - observed the clusters in a short exposure with the saao version of landolt standard stars in the equator @xcite and blue and red standard stars @xcite on a photometric night during the observing run in october 1999 .",
    "the observed standard stars ( or regions ) are sa 112 , sa 114 , sa 93 , sa 99 , bd -11 162 , gl 876 and gl 273 .",
    "table 2 lists the observational log .",
    "grayscale maps of the @xmath11-band images of the clusters taken with long exposures are displayed in fig .  1 .",
    "in most cases , the cluster field is a small part of the observed frame .",
    "solid circles in fig .",
    "1 represent the angular diameters of the clusters given in the cocd whose centers were determined by visual inspection of the images .",
    "we obtained photometric diagrams of the clusters for the stars located within the circles .",
    "we have followed standard ccd reduction techniques using iraf / ccdred for the preprocessing of the images obtained .",
    "this includes the subtraction of bias levels with overscan correction , trimming and flat - fielding .",
    "we used iraf / daophot to obtain instrumental magnitudes of the stars .",
    "we applied aperture corrections to the instrumental magnitudes of cluster stars obtained from point spread function ( psf ) fitting , using the instrumental magnitudes obtained with an aperture radius of @xmath12 .",
    "the transformation of the instrumental system to the standard system was made using the following equations ( see the similar transformation for the @xmath13 telescope at siding spring observatory : @xcite ) : @xmath14 or @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xmath20 where uppercase characters , lowercase characters , @xmath21 , x and @xmath22 represent standard magnitudes , instrumental magnitudes , extinction coefficients , airmass , and zero points , respectively . in the transformation of the @xmath23 magnitude , a non - linear function , @xmath24 ,",
    "is involved .",
    "the function @xmath24 allows the correction of redder @xmath25 colors , probably due to a red - leak in the @xmath23 filter @xcite .",
    "it increases linearly up to @xmath26 , but shows a non - linear increase for redder stars .",
    "this correction dominated the other factors , and we did not take into account the ( @xmath10 ) term in the @xmath23 transformation . the extinction coefficients derived from standard star photometry are @xmath27 = 0.485 @xmath28 0.024 , @xmath29 = 0.232@xmath28 0.035 , @xmath30 = 0.142 @xmath28 0.023 and @xmath31 = 0.058 @xmath28 0.027 .",
    "the final transformation errors were between 0.021 mag in @xmath11 and 0.038 mag in @xmath23 .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes obtained from the observations in non - photometric conditions during the december run were transformed to the standard system using the observations of the october run .",
    "the photometric data will be presented in the electronic aj .",
    "we calculate the external observational errors of the photometry of the cluster stars using the pair of exposures in the 1998 december run and the short exposures in the 1999 october run .",
    "2 shows the resulting observational errors as a function of @xmath11 magnitude .",
    "the error bars in fig .",
    "2 are the standard deviations of the observational errors for the stars in each magnitude bin . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the observational errors for stars fainter than @xmath32 increase with increasing magnitude , while the observational errors for stars brighter than @xmath32 are nearly constant with relatively large uncertainties due to the small number of stars in the magnitude bins .",
    "we have determined the basic physical parameters of the 12 open clusters by analyzing the color - color diagrams and cmds of the clusters .",
    "photometric diagrams of the clusters are derived from the photometry of stars inside the angular diameters @xcite plotted in fig . 1 . to achieve improved accuracy in the derived parameters , we used stars with daophot errors less than 0.1 mag .",
    "in addition , due to large errors in @xmath23 , the @xmath25 vs @xmath33 diagrams were constructed using stars brighter than @xmath34 . in general , as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the total observational errors are quite large ( @xmath35 ) even for the brightest stars .",
    "however , the present photometry is good enough to derive the cluster parameters using isochrone fittings .",
    "we have estimated the reddening of the clusters from @xmath25 vs @xmath33 diagrams , by comparing theoretical zams of the padova isochrones @xcite with the observed distributions of cluster stars . to do this",
    ", we assumed a slope of @xmath36 = 0.72 @xcite , a total to selective extinction ratio @xmath37=3.0 and @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using theoretical zams is the ability to take into account the metallicity effect on the stellar distribution in the color - color diagrams .",
    "because the metallicity of clusters is not known beforehand , we assumed the solar abundance as the cluster abundance unless the stellar distributions in the color - color diagrams and cmds can not be described by the solar abundance isochrones .",
    "we used the padova isochrones @xcite in the isochrone fittings .",
    "we put the greatest weight on the stars in the turnoff regions and giant branches , if present , since the lower main sequences are more heavily contaminated by field stars .",
    "we attempted to fit the lower envelope of the main sequence , considering the photometric errors .",
    "the best fit solutions were obtained by visual inspections of the cmds with the trial fittings .",
    "we present the results of the best fits in fig . 3 and the resulting cluster parameters are given in table 3 .",
    "since we put the greatest weight on the stars in the regions which are supposed to be the giant branches of some clusters , the memberships of these stars are crucial to the derived cluster parameters . to see whether these stars are cluster giants or not , we plotted cleaned cmds in fig .",
    "4 . to obtain the cleaned cmds , we statistically removed field stars from the cluster cmds by finding stars nearest to the field stars with a photometric box of @xmath39 in @xmath11 and @xmath40 in @xmath33 .",
    "because we did not observe field region of each cluster , we constructed the cmds of field stars by selecting stars randomly from the regions outside the radii that are two times larger than the cluster radii in the same ccd images , except for be 70 for which field stars are selected from the region outside 1.5 times larger than the cluster radius due to the larger angular size of the cluster . as shown in fig .",
    "4 , giant stars are left over in the cleaned cmds .",
    "this result strongly suggests that many stars in the red giants locus could be the members of the cluster . in the following ,",
    "we briefly describe the properties of the individual clusters .",
    "be 104 is located to the south of a very bright star , hd225094 . as indicated by its trumpler class of @xmath41 ,",
    "be 104 is one of the most poorly defined clusters . due to the paucity of members and the heavy contamination by field stars ,",
    "the cmds of be 104 show a very broad main sequence which is not much different from that of the field star cmds near the cluster .",
    "thanks to the presence of a few giants which are thought to be cluster members as they appear in the cleaned cmd in fig.4 , we could derive the cluster parameters by fitting the isochrones to the stellar distributions in the cmds .",
    "the resulting cluster parameters are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , log(t[yrs ] ) = @xmath44 , and [ fe / h ] @xmath45 dex .",
    "most of the stars brighter than the turnoff point of the main - sequence stars are considered to be field stars .",
    "however , there seem also to be a few blue straggler candidates according to their positions on the cmds .",
    "be 60 is also a poorly defined cluster with a trumpler class of @xmath46 . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , there are several bright stars in the field of be 60 most of which seem to be foreground stars . however , the cmds of the stars in the central region of be 60 show a well defined main sequence which permits a reasonably good isochrone fitting .",
    "the resulting best fit isochrone gives the cluster parameters as @xmath42 , @xmath47 , log(t[yrs ] ) = @xmath48 and [ fe / h ] @xmath45 dex .",
    "the two brightest red stars near @xmath49 are not plotted in the @xmath11 vs @xmath50 cmd due to saturation in the @xmath51 image .      as shown in fig . 1",
    ", king  15 shows the typical properties of @xmath52 clusters , which are characterized by a small number of member stars and no central concentration .",
    "however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , the stellar distributions in the cmds of the cluster are well represented by the isochrone of log(t[yrs ] ) = @xmath53 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath54 dex with a distance modulus and reddening of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "@xcite derived a slightly smaller distance modulus , @xmath57 and smaller reddening , @xmath58 for king 15 . since they had no @xmath23-band photometry ,",
    "their reddening estimate was obtained by fitting the @xcite s zams to the stellar distribution in the @xmath11 vs @xmath33 cmd .",
    "they estimated the age of king 15 to be @xmath59 gyr from the color of the earliest spectral type star on the main - sequence ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the reason for the large discrepancy between the age derived from the isochrone fittings and that found by @xcite is due to the fact that they considered stars brighter than @xmath61 to be field stars , while we consider them as cluster members according to their positions in the cmds as well as spatial position in the cluster field .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , the presence of stars brighter than @xmath61 in the cleaned cmd support the assumption that @xmath62 are cluster members .",
    "however , it is quite natural for them to believe the stars brighter than @xmath61 to be field stars since their cmd is heavily populated by field stars due to the larger field compared to ours .",
    "they constructed the cmd from the stars in a field of @xmath9 , which is nearly the same field as that of the total ccd image for king 15 in fig .",
    "if stars brighter than @xmath61 are member stars of king 15 , there is a large gap in the upper main sequence of the cluster .",
    "ngc 381 is an intermediate - age open cluster with a trumpler class of @xmath63 .",
    "there seem to be no giant stars in the cluster probably due to its small number member stars .",
    "the main sequence of the cluster is well defined in the cmds although there are a large number of field stars in the direction of ngc 381 .",
    "owing to the foreground and background field stars , the color - color diagram of ngc 381 is quite complicated .",
    "however , it is not difficult to determine the cluster reddening by fitting the theoretical zams to the distribution of the main - sequence stars in the color - color diagram because they are well isolated from the field stars . as shown fig.3 , the isochrone of log(t[yrs ] ) = @xmath64 and [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath45 dex fits well the stellar distribution in the cmds of ngc 381 with a distance modulus and reddening of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the present estimates of the distance modulus and reddening of the cluster are in good agreement with those determined by @xcite but their age estimate of log(t[yrs ] ) = 9.04 , obtained using the isochrone of @xcite , is about a factor of three larger than ours .",
    "be 64 shows the typical morphology of a trumpler class @xmath67 cluster which is characterized by a slight concentration of member stars of similar brightness with medium richness .",
    "because the color - color diagram does not show any clear cluster sequences due to the small number of bright stars with small photometric errors in @xmath23 , we adopt @xmath68 @xcite as the cluster reddening .",
    "the cmds of be 64 show a quite broad main sequence due to contamination by field stars however , the presence of giant stars , most of which are thought to be cluster members from the cleaned cmd in fig .",
    "4 , makes it possible to fit the isochrones to the stellar distributions in the cmds unambiguously . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the adopted isochrone of log(t[yrs ] ) = @xmath69 and [ fe / h ] = @xmath70 dex with @xmath71 and @xmath72 fits the stellar distribution in the cmds quite well .",
    "our estimates of the distance modulus and age are in good agreement with those of @xcite .",
    "king 6 is a nearby cluster with a trumpler class of @xmath73 . as shown in fig",
    "1 , the angular diameter of the cluster is comparable to the size of the observed field because of its proximity .",
    "the cmds of king  6 show a well defined main sequence with a relatively small number of field stars , especially in the upper main sequence .",
    "however , the lower main sequence , fainter than @xmath74 , seems to be contaminated by field stars .",
    "although there seems to be a clear sequence in fig .",
    "3 , the stellar distributions in the color - color diagram of king 6 can not be fitted by the theoretical zams with a single reddening value .",
    "the stars fainter than @xmath75 seem to have a smaller reddening of @xmath76 , while the stars brighter than @xmath77 appear to have a larger reddening of @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we adopted a mean value of @xmath79 as the reddening of king 6 .",
    "this is the reason why the stellar distributions in the color - color diagram show a relatively poor match with the theoretical zams which is shifted by a reddening value of @xmath80 .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the isochrone of log(t[yrs ] ) = @xmath53 and [ fe / h ] @xmath81 dex , shifted by a distance modulus and reddening of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , gives a pretty good match with the stellar distributions in the cmds of the cluster .",
    "there is a slight indication of the presence of the binary sequence above the zams .",
    "ngc 1348 is the youngest among the observed clusters and is relatively well recognized due to the absence of field stars comparable in brightness to the bright members of the cluster , although the cluster stars do not show any obvious central concentration .",
    "this is the reason why ngc 1348 is classified as trumpler class @xmath84 . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the color - color diagram of ngc 1348 shows a well defined sequence which is well matched with the theoretical zams of the solar abundance shifted by @xmath85 . the isochrone fittings to the stellar distributions in the cmds give the cluster parameters of log(t[yrs ] ) = @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and [ fe / h ] @xmath89 dex , respectively .",
    "the brightest star near @xmath90=2.4 is saturated in the @xmath51 image and is omitted in the @xmath11 vs @xmath50 diagram .",
    "be 12 is an old cluster with a trumpler class of @xmath67 .",
    "although be 12 is located in the direction of a rich star field , it can be well distinguished from field stars due to the concentration of the member stars .",
    "the cmds of the cluster show a broad main sequence caused by heavy contamination by field stars .",
    "the color - color diagram of be 12 also shows no clear sequence due to the lack of a sufficient number of cluster main - sequence stars that are bright enough to have small photometric errors in @xmath23 as well as the contamination by field stars .",
    "the presence of blue straggler stars which are located in the bright extension of the main sequence of be 12 may contribute to the large scatter in the color - color diagram .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the isochrone of log(t[yrs ] ) @xmath91 and [ fe / h ] @xmath89 dex fits the main sequence together with the giant branch quite well with a distance modulus and reddening of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively",
    ". the old age of the cluster supports the existence of blue straggler stars based on the presence of stars brighter and bluer than the turnoff point of the cluster main sequence because such stars are more frequently found in old open clusters @xcite      be 70 is located in a direction toward which a large number of foreground stars are located .",
    "the cmds of the cluster show a broad main sequence due to heavy contamination by field stars .",
    "the color - color diagram appears to be complicated due to the field star contamination , but we could determine the reddening of the cluster by fitting the theoretical zams to the distributions of upper main - sequence stars and populous giant stars which constitute a well defined cluster sequence in the cnds .",
    "the broad sequence around @xmath94 in the color - color diagram is due to the field star population , whose mean reddening is much smaller than that of the cluster .",
    "the heavy contamination of field stars is apparent from the cleaned cmd of be 70 in fig .",
    "4 . however , some of the bright blue stars above the turnoff point of the main sequence of be 70 may be blue straggler stars from their presence in the cleaned cmd of the cluster . owing to the well developed giant branch and the highly populated main sequences , it is not difficult to fit the isochrones to the stellar distributions in the cmds .",
    "the resulting cluster parameters are log(t[yrs ] ) @xmath91 , [ fe / h ] @xmath95 dex , @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "be 23 is located near the direction of the anti - galactic center direction . as indicated by its trumpler class of @xmath63 , it shows no strong central concentration but can be identified by its relatively dense population compared to that of the field stars .",
    "most of the brightest stars above the turnoff point are considered to be foreground stars because the cmd of a nearby field region shows similar stellar distributions . however , there is also a possibility that some of the stars that are brighter and bluer than the turnoff of the main sequence are blue straggler stars .",
    "we derived the cluster parameters by fitting the isochrone of log(t[yrs ] ) @xmath98 and [ fe / h ] @xmath89 to the stellar distribution , especially near the turnoff , with a distance modulus and reddening of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , respectively .",
    "the theoretical zams of the solar abundance shifted by the adopted reddening of @xmath101 describes well the distribution of upper main - sequence stars in the color - color diagram .",
    "most of the forground stars seems to be affected by negligible reddening .",
    "ngc 2259 is a well detached system of trumpler class @xmath41 .",
    "most of the bright stars in the direction of ngc 2259 are cluster main - sequence stars near the main - sequence turnoff .",
    "there seems to be little contamination by field stars in the upper main sequence but the lower main sequence is somewhat contaminated by field stars .",
    "owing to the proximity of the cluster , the main - sequence stars bluer than @xmath102 are bright enough to produce a clear sequence in the color - color diagram .",
    "thus , we derived the cluster reddening by fitting the theoretical zams to the distribution of bright main - sequence stars in the color - color diagram .",
    "we applied the isochrone fittings to the stellar distributions in the cmds of ngc 2259 with the reddening derived from the zams fitting .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the isochrone of log(t[yrs ] ) @xmath103 and [ fe / h ] @xmath89 dex with a distance modulus and reddening of @xmath104 and @xmath105 , respectively , matches well with the stellar distributions in the cmds of ngc 2259 .",

    "it is well distinguished from the field stars .",
    "the color - color diagram shows a well defined cluster sequence which is nicely matched with the theoretical zams of [ fe / h ] @xmath95 shifted by @xmath106 .",

    "the stellar distributions in the cmds of ngc 2304 show the typical characteristics of intermediate - age open clusters .",

    "4 . the isochrone of log(t[yrs ] )",
    "@xmath98 and [ fe / h ] @xmath95 dex with @xmath107 and @xmath108 fits well the stellar distribution in the cmds of ngc 2304 .",
    "there seems to be a binary sequence above the zams .",
    "we have determined the distances , reddenings , ages and metallicities of 12 target clusters by isochrone fittings complemented by zams fittings for the reddening estimates . to our best knowledge",
    ", no known cluster parameters were previously derived for any of the clusters except for king 15 , ngc 381 , and be 64 .",
    "comparison of the cluster parameters derived from the present photometry with those found by other researchers for king 15 , ngc 381 and be 64 @xcite shows that our estimates are in good agreement with independent studies .",
    "the mean interstellar absorption derived from the reddening of the 12 open clusters is @xmath109 mag@xmath110kpc@xmath111 , which is slightly smaller than the mean interstellar absorption of the galactic disk , @xmath112 mag@xmath110kpc@xmath111 , derived from cocd @xcite .",
    "the smaller mean interstellar absorption reflects the general characteristics of the interstellar reddening toward the anti - galactic center , and the large standard deviation is due to the inhomogeneous distribution of the interstellar clouds @xcite .",
    "be 23 and ngc 2304 , which are located in a direction very close to the anti - galactic center , show extremely small interstellar absorptions of 0.17 mag@xmath110kpc@xmath111 and 0.08 mag@xmath110kpc@xmath111 , respectively , while king 6 and ngc 1348 , which are located in the direction of the cassiopeia - perseus region @xcite , show large interstellar absorptions of 1.72 mag@xmath110kpc@xmath111 and 1.68 mag@xmath110kpc@xmath111 , respectively .",
    "the large interstellar absorption in this direction might be due to the dense interstellar cloud close to the sun @xcite .",
    "the apparent gap in the main sequence of king 15 seems to be a real feature because the stars brighter than @xmath61 are thought to be cluster members .",
    "thus , the age of king 15 is @xmath113 myr , which is much smaller than that suggested by @xcite .",
    "however , the gap near @xmath62 is not a physical gap related to stellar evolution but is caused by random statistical fluctuations due to the small number of member stars .",
    "king 15 is too young for the cluster to have a main - sequence gap similar to those of ngc 2420 @xcite and ngc 2243 @xcite , which are thought to be related to the rapid hydrogen exhausting phase of the convective core @xcite .",
    "the gap in king 15 is similar to those of be 7 , ngc 637 , and be 62 @xcite , all of which are thought to be caused by statistical fluctuations in the high mass part of the imfs @xcite .",
    "we have found blue straggler candidates in the four open clusters , be 104 , be 12 , be 70 , and be 23 , which have ages greater than 800 myr .",
