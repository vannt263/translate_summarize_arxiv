    "generally integrable systems show abnormal energy transport , namely the fourier heat law is not realized there .",
    "this attributes to the lack of scattering between modes , which should be induced by nonintegrability .",
    "two typical characteristics are seen in the energy transport in integrable systems .",
    "one is energy flux per unit volume independent of the system size .",
    "the other is a flat temperature profile with no global temperature gradient .",
    "the harmonic chain is a typical integrable system which shows these characteristics @xcite .",
    "rieder , lebowitz and lieb ( rll ) investigated the classical harmonic chain whose ends are in contact with heat reservoirs at different temperatures @xcite .",
    "they exactly evaluated the covariance matrix of the variables in the stationary state using the langevin equation , and they proved these characteristics .",
    "that is , they found that energy flux per volume is proportional to only temperature difference and is independent of the system size , and no global temperature gradient is formed .",
    "although the temperature profile is flat in the internal region , they found the peculiar behavior in the vicinity of the ends of the chain .",
    "namely , the local temperature is _ higher _ than the bulk value near the _ colder _ reservoir , and _ lower _ near the _ hotter _ reservoir .",
    "zrcher and talkner ( zt ) @xcite investigated a quantum model corresponding to that of rll with use of the quantum langevin equation@xcite .",
    "as for the bulk behavior , they found the same features as in the classical case .",
    "that is , no global temperature gradient is formed and energy flux is independent of system size . in the high temperature limit , the quantum langevin equation is reduced to the langevin equation with the gaussian white noise and all the characteristics obtained in @xcite are reproduced .",
    "however , temperature profile in the vicinity of the ends of the system shows some variety depending on temperature and a damping constant .",
    "the reservoir employed in these studies is only the ohmic type , which is one of the possible three types of heat reservoirs : sub - ohmic , ohmic , and super - ohmic . because integrable systems have no scattering between modes , their nonequilibrium behavior will be easily affected by the types of reservoirs at the boundary .",
    "thus in this paper , we investigate how nonequilibrium nature in the harmonic chain depends on the types of reservoirs . here",
    "we derive the master equation for the reduced density matrix through the projection operator method on assumption that the reservoir is composed of an infinite number of independent harmonic oscillators .",
    "this method is valid in the weak coupling limit and for slow motion of the system because it treats the second order perturbation with respect to a coupling constant and the markovian approximation @xcite .",
    "we investigate the effect of the spectral density on the temperature profile and energy flux in the quantum harmonic chain in contact with two reservoirs applying the master equation for reduced density matrix . at the weak coupling limit",
    ", the stationary state can be obtained analytically , and it is found that when the two reservoirs have the same type of spectral density , the temperature profile is independent of it , and the profile is the same as the result previously reported@xcite . on the other hand , when the spectral densities are of different types , the temperature profile depends on the types . even in the classical limit , the internal temperature deviates from the mean value of the temperature of the reservoirs and we observe a deviation of temperatures around ends from the temperature of internal region .",
    "the direction of deviation is determined by frequency dependence of the spectral density near @xmath0    we also investigate the reduced density matrix with finite values of the coupling constant numerically . although it is derived in the perturbation of the coupling constant and it is only valid in the weak coupling limit , we dare regard the master equation with a finite coupling constant as a model for a time evolution with a dissipation . in other words , we assume that the time evolution qualitatively represents a kind of real phenomena in nature , where the coupling constant represents the strength of the dissipative mechanism .",
    "we study qualitatively the dependence of temperature profile on the types of reservoirs .",
    "it even has been reported in some cases that the reduced density matrix with a finite coupling can produce a good long time behavior of the system in comparison with the exact path - integral result not only qualitatively but also quantitatively @xcite .",
    "temperature profile at the ends of the chain is found to depend on the spectral density and the temperatures of the reservoirs even when reservoirs at both ends have same type of spectral density .",
    "the dependence on the types of the reservoirs is discussed in the fokker - planck equations in the classical limit .",

    "ii , we derive the master equation for the reduced density matrix of a general many body system in contact with a phonon reservoir . sec .",

    "the equation generally satisfies the necessary condition for the master equation that the canonical distribution must be a stationary solution when the reservoirs are at the same temperature .    in sec .  3 , we have applied the master equation to energy transport in the quantum harmonic chain .",

    "this result leads to the classical temperature @xmath171 which is originally found by rll using the ohmic type of reservoir . on the other hand ,",
    "when the types of spectral densities are different , the internal temperature is a function of the both densities , so that the temperature does not converge to @xmath171 in the classical limit .",

    "we considered only the case of the same spectral densities of the reservoirs .",
    "finite coupling contributes to the temperature profile only near the ends of the chain and bulk behavior is the same as that of weak coupling limit .",
    "we found that the profile near the ends depends on the spectral density for the reservoirs .",
    "when the reservoir temperature is sufficiently low where quantum fluctuations are dominant , temperature growth near both the ends was observed in every case .",
    "when the reservoir temperatures are high enough and the reservoir is sub - ohmic or ohmic , the same peculiar behavior , i.e. , nonmonotonic change of the temperature , is observed as found in @xcite . however , in the case of super - ohmic reservoir , the peculiarity disappears .    in order to understand the dependence on the spectral density , we derived fokker - planck equations from the master equation in the classical limit . if the reservoir is ohmic the fokker - planck equation agrees with the standard one derived from the langevin equation .",
    "when the reservoir is non - ohmic , however , there appears difference in the diffusion term , i.e. , form of second derivative .",
    "the coefficients of the diffusion terms were calculated from the spectral density.this difference causes different temperature profiles near the ends of the chain .",
    "we expect that the master equation derived here can be used for other systems such as spin systems for which the langevin approach is practically difficult . in the case of the harmonic chain , operator @xmath56",
    "was written in a simple form by using some system operators .",
    "thus we were able to analyze the master equation systematically .",
    "this can be done because the harmonic chain is integrable .",
    "thus , similar procedure can be developed for other integrable systems , e.g.  the xy model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we have confined ourselves to the integrable system .",
    "however the master equation derived here is generally applicable to any system because the matrix element of @xmath56 is explicitly given .",
    "thus it would be an interesting future problem to study the thermal conductivity in nonintegrable system where the fourier heat law is realized @xcite .",
