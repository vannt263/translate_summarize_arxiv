    "perturbative calculations in quantum field theory are often a hard task , specially if one does not have a suitable approach to tackle the problem . among the several techniques available in the market",
    "the most popular is the feynman parametrization@xcite ; in fact , if one is clever enough hefty calculations ( at 2-loop level ) can be done@xcite .",
    "however , in our point of view , this is not the most adequate nor elegant method to solve feynman integrals whether one is considering covariant or non - covariant gauges .",
    "on the other hand , chetyrkin _ et al _ developed the integration by parts in configuration space ( associated with gegenbauer polynomials ) and performed ( at 4-loops ) even heftier calculations@xcite .",
    "however , their technique has a drawback : if the diagrams have more than two external legs manipulation of gegenbauer polynomials becomes very difficult @xcite to handle .",
    "mellin - barnes contour integration is a third option in the market .",
    "each propagator is mellin - transformed@xcite  a very simple step  and using barnes lemmas and summing over the residues , it is possible to write the feynman integrals as hypergeometric functions or hypergeometric - like series .",
    "smirnov@xcite solved the massless double - box with mellin - barnes approach .",
    "such mellin integrals are parametric - like integrals  though they are much simpler to solve than feynman - like ones because cauchy theorem can be applied straightforwardly .",
    "@xcite is a technique where the parametric integrals do not appear .",
    "we start up with a gaussian integral , which is well - behaved , perform taylor expansion and solve systems of algebraic equations .",
    "all the calculations can be done analytically and the results are given for arbitrary exponents of propagators and space - time dimension @xmath0 , as in the standard dimensional regularization@xcite .",
    "even integrals pertaining to the trickier non - covariant gauges , such the light - cone@xcite and coulomb@xcite ones , can be performed using the same approach ( however , we will deal with them in another work ) . in the following sections we will show how this can be done .",
    "the outline for our paper is as follows : in section ii we consider the simplest two - loop diagram , our workhorse , as a pedagogical example and to present , in a clean way , the technique of negative - dimensional integration .",
    "section iii is devoted to the referred diagram but now with tensorial structure .",
    "the can handle vector , second rank tensor and higher integrals , all at the same time . in the fourth section we replace massless propagators by massive ones and in section v ,",
    "we consider the massless diagram with n - insertions of the same type . in the last section ,",
    "vi , we present our concluding remarks .",
    "to make things clear we begin with the diagram of figure 1 . in a massless scalar",
    "theory it is represented by ,    a = .",
    "consider the gaussian integral , [ gauss ] g = d^d q d^d k , where @xmath1 are such that @xmath2 is well - behaved .",
    "we will see that it is the generating functional of negative - dimensional integrals , see eq.([taylor ] )",
    ". integrating over @xmath3 and @xmath4 is very easy , [ g ] g = ( ) ^d/2 , where @xmath5 .",
    "expanding ( [ g ] ) in taylor series and using a multinomial expansion for @xmath6 we get ,    [ serie ] g = ^d _ n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4= 0^(-n_1-d/2 ) ! , where due to our multinomial expansion , @xmath7 , and we define @xmath8 and so forth .",
    "on the other hand , taylor expanding ( [ gauss ] ) , [ taylor ] g = _ i , j , l= 0^ d^d q d^d k ( q^2)^i(k^2)^j(p - q - k)^2l , one generates the negative-@xmath0 integral .",
    "now , comparing ( [ serie ] ) and ( [ taylor ] ) we solve for the integral above ,    [ geral ] a(i , j , l ) & = & d^d qd^d k ( q^2)^i(k^2)^j(p - q - k)^2l + & = & [ geral-2 ] _",
    "n_1,n_2,n_3,n_4= 0^ _ n_123,i _ n_124,j _ n_134,l _ n_234 , -n_1 - d/2 , where the kronecker deltas give rise to a system of 4 equations and 4 `` unknowns '' .",
    "plugging the solution into ( [ geral-2 ] ) provides us the result of @xmath9 , namely ,    [ facil ] a(i , j , l ) = ( p^2)^,where @xmath10 .",
    "however , the above result is valid on the negative - dimensional region and positive exponents of propagators @xmath11 . to bring it to our real physical world",
    "we must invoke the principle of analytic continuation .",
    "this is a quite simple step@xcite : group the gamma functions into pochhammer symbols and use one of its properties , ( a)_k ( a|k ) = , ( a|-k ) = .",
    "doing so , we get the result in our positive - dimensional world ,    [ escalar ] a^ac(i , j , l ) = ^d ( p^2)^(-i|i+j+d/2 ) ( -j|j+k+d/2 ) ( -k|i+k+d/2 ) ( + d/2|-2-d/2),and negative exponents of propagators @xmath12 in euclidean space .",
    "observe that the result is symmetric in the propagators exponents reflecting the symmetry of figure 1 .",
    "the recipe for calculating feynman integrals using technology is quite simple : i ) to each loop write a gaussian integral whose arguments are the propagators of the diagram in question ; ii ) complete the square(s ) and integrate ; iii ) take the original gaussian integral , taylor expand the exponential and change the order @xmath13 ; this operation generates negative - dimensional integrals ; iv ) the equality of these two expressions must hold , so one can solve for the negative - dimensional integral and gets @xmath14-fold series involving kronecker deltas ; v ) such kronecker deltas give rise to a system of linear algebraic equations , in most cases it has not a unique solution , since it is a rectangular matrix@xcite ; vi ) plugging the solution(s ) into that series representation provides the result of negative - dimensional integral  sometimes in massless cases there appears degenerate solutions@xcite ; vii ) analytically continue the referred result to positive - dimensional region using the above property of pochhammer symbols .",
    "the whole procedure is quite simple , and we will show that in cases of interest .",
    "the previous result was obtained with amazing easiness : arbitrary negative exponents of propagators , positive dimension and no numerical calculations .",
    "the reader can rightfully ask : does work for tensorial numerators as well ?",
    "the answer is yes@xcite .",
    "we need to modify only one thing .",
    "consider the integral ,    ( i , j , l , m ) = d^d q d^d k ( q^2)^i(k^2)^j(p - q - k)^2l ( 2qp)^m .    from , [ gauss - tens ] g_t & = & d^d q d^d k + & = & ( ) ^d/2 , + & = & ^d _",

    "there are @xmath16 distinct ways of solving this @xmath17 system , but 5 of them have no solution at all .    in a previous work@xcite",
    "we did show that all non - trivial solutions are legitimate and lead to the same result for the feynman integral in question . here",
    "the same occurs  but we will not prove it .",
    "note that the tensorial sector of the feynman integral @xmath18 is contained in the factor @xmath19 and for this very reason the exponent @xmath20 can not be analytically continued to allow for negative values .",
    "in other words , we must invoke the principle of analytic continuation for three exponents of propagators leaving the fourth , @xmath20 , untouched .",
    "all the solutions will give rise to a double series of hypergeometric type , since we have a 7-fold series and only 5 kronecker deltas in ( [ b - geral ] ) .",
    "however , from the theory of hypergeometric series@xcite we know that when one of its numerator parameters is a negative integer , say @xmath21 , the series is truncated and has only @xmath20 terms . for this reason we will consider a solution that is obtained when @xmath22 are left undetermined .",

    "is a powerful technique .",
    "it gives , simultaneously , vector , second rank tensor and higher order integrals .",
    "a second question one could ask is : does work for massive propagators as well ?",
    "the answer is also yes and we need to do only slight modifications .",
    "let our generating function , corresponding to diagram of figure 1 where now the virtual particles have distinct masses , be    [ gauss - m ] g_m & = & d^d q d^d r + & = & _ i , j , k= 0^(i , j , k ) where , ( i , j , k ) = d^d q d^d r ( q^2-m_1 ^ 2)^i(r^2-m_2 ^ 2)^j^k + , using ( [ g ] ) we get ,    [ gm ] g_m = g , and following the general procedure , as in the previous cases , one can write the integral as , ( i , j , k ) = _",

    "the kronecker deltas give rise to a @xmath31 system of linear algebraic equations .",
    "we have 35 possible solutions for such system but 15 of them have no solution at all .",
    "so , we are left with 20 triple series , following the prescription of summing the ones which have the same variables@xcite ( it is equivalent to say that we sum the ones which have the same region of convergence@xcite ) , we get four possible triple series ( of hypergeometric type ) representing the feynman integral @xmath32 ,    @xmath33 for the first one we have eight solutions , the second , third and fourth have four , so we have 20 possible solutions of the system generated by the kronecker deltas @xmath34 .",
    "since the last three have the same form , due to the symmetry of the diagram in question , we will consider only one of them ; the others can be obtained changing masses and exponents of propagators .",
