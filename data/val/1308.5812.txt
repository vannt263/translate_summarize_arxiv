    "<S> we consider the quasiparticle excitations of a trapped dipolar bose - einstein condensate . by mapping these excitations onto linear and angular momentum </S>",
    "<S> we show that the roton modes are clearly revealed as discrete fingers in parameter space , whereas the other modes form a smooth surface . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the properties of the roton modes and characterize how they change with the dipole interaction strength . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how the application of a perturbing potential can be used to engineer angular rotons , i.e.  allowing us to controllably select modes of non - zero projection of angular momentum to become the lowest energy rotons . </S>"
