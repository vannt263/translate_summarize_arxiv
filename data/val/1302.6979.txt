    "this paper concerns the explicit construction of extremal khler metrics on compact @xmath0-orbifolds , including khler metrics which are conformally einstein ( either globally or on the complement of real hypersurface ) .",
    "the examples we construct are toric with second betti number two , i.e. , their rational delzant polytope ( which is the image of the momentum map of the @xmath3-torus action  @xcite ) ) is a quadrilateral .",
    "more precisely , we use extremal _ ambitoric _ metrics , which we classified locally in part i of this work , to resolve completely the existence problem in the quadrilateral case .",
    "there are several narratives to which this paper may be viewed as a contribution .",
    "a general theme is the interplay between the abstract existence theory for a geometric pde , and the construction of explicit solutions associated to special geometric structures .",
    "extremal khler metrics were introduced by e.  calabi  @xcite to address the problem of finding canonical khler metrics with khler form in a given cohomology class @xmath4 on a compact complex manifold .",
    "the @xmath5 norm of the scalar curvature yields a functional on @xmath4 , and its critical points are the extremal metrics .",
    "they are thus natural generalizations of constant curvature metrics on riemann surfaces ; in general , the euler  lagrange equation asserts that a khler metric is extremal if its scalar curvature is hamiltonian for a killing vector field . as a geometric pde ,",
    "this is quasilinear of fourth order , and no general methods are currently available .",
    "nevertheless , considerable progress on the existence theory has been made , following the seminal work of calabi  @xcite on the non - positive khler ",
    "einstein case and the resolution of his famous conjecture by t.  aubin  @xcite and s - t .",
    "yau  @xcite .",
    "conjectures going back to yau  @xcite , g.  tian  @xcite and s.  donaldson  @xcite state that the obstruction to the existence of an extremal khler metric in the class @xmath6 of a polarized complex manifold @xmath7 should be a purely algebro - geometric `` stability condition '' on the pair @xmath7 , and these conjectures may be extended to orbifolds  @xcite .",
    "defining a precise notion of stability is part of the problem , one candidate being `` k-(_poly_)_stability _ ''  @xcite : the necessity of k - polystability has been proven for constant scalar curvature metrics  @xcite , and a version of k - polystability relative to a maximal torus of the automorphism group of @xmath7 , developed by g.  szkelyhidi  @xcite , is necessary for the existence of an extremal khler metric of non - constant scalar curvature  @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty with the theory is that in practice it is not only difficult to determine whether a given polarized variety admits an extremal khler metric  it is also difficult to verify a proposed stability condition .",
    "consequently classes of complex manifolds or orbifolds for which extremality and stability are more tractable play an important role .",
    "these examples come in two main flavours : _ ruled _ and _ toric_. using a construction due to calabi  @xcite , ruled surfaces and other projective line bundles provide a setting for many explicit extremal khler metrics  @xcite .",
    "we refer to these as metrics _ of calabi type _ ; they admit a hamiltonian @xmath3-form of order one  @xcite .",
    "the extremality equations reduce to odes with explicit polynomial solutions , and stability amounts to a positivity condition on the solution  @xcite . for toric varieties , in contrast , the extremality equations only reduce to a nonlinear fourth order pde in the momenta ; explicit solutions are hard to find , but the existence theory is well - developed  @xcite and there is a well - understood notion of `` relative k - polystability with respect to toric degenerations '' which is widely believed to be equivalent to existence  @xcite .",
    "explicit examples are largely limited to orthotoric @xmath8-orbifolds , which admit a hamiltonian @xmath3-form of order @xmath9 and have a convex @xmath9-cube ( or degeneration ) for their rational delzant polytope  @xcite .    in dimension four , examples and",
    "theory come together to provide a moderately complete picture .",
    "extremal khler surfaces of calabi type are locally toric ( as the base is a constant curvature riemann surface ) and there are specific results for toric surfaces : for example , k - polystability implies uniform k - polystability  @xcite and for constant scalar metrics , existence is equivalent to k - polystability  @xcite .",
    "our paper is closely related to work of e.  legendre  @xcite , who investigated systematically the extent to which explicit methods resolve the existence problem when the rational delzant polytope is a convex quadrilateral .",
    "her solution highlighted the role of the _ extremal affine function _",
    "@xmath10 on the rational delzant polytope , a combinatorial invariant which pulls back to the scalar curvature in the extremal case .",
    "her main results show that hamiltonian @xmath3-form methods suffice only for `` equipoised '' quadrilaterals , for which @xmath10 has equal values at the midpoints of the diagonals .",
    "a key ingredient in legendre s work is the observation that @xmath10 is linear in the inverse lengths of the normals . using this",
    ", she resolved the existence problem for the codimension one family of equipoised quadrilaterals using orthotoric , calabi type or product metrics .",
    "the theory of hamiltonian @xmath3-forms in four dimensions  @xcite implies that these toric metrics are in fact _ ambitoric _ , i.e. , toric with respect to a pair of oppositely oriented but conformally equivalent khler metrics .",
    "the local classification of ambitoric structures  @xcite implies that the `` regular '' examples ( i.e. , neither a product nor of calabi type ) are determined by a quadratic polynomial @xmath11 and two functions @xmath12 of one variable .",
    "regular ambitoric structures reduce to orthotoric metrics precisely when @xmath11 has vanishing discriminant .",
    "the extremality conditions for regular ambitoric structures can be explicitly solved with @xmath12 given by quartic polynomials  @xcite , and this generalization suffices to remove the equipoisedness constraint introduced by legendre .    to prove this , we use , in addition to ambitoric geometry , two further ingredients .",
    "the first is an analysis of rational delzant quadrilaterals building on  @xcite .",
    "we compute the extremal affine function @xmath10 and establish a notion of `` temperateness '' for polystable quadrilaterals which implies @xmath10 is positive at the midpoints of the diagonals .",
    "the second is the concept of a `` factorization structure '' , which makes precise the separation of variables technique that underpins explicit solutions of geometric pdes on toric @xmath0-orbifolds .",
    "one can hope such an approach will work in @xmath8-dimensions when the rational delzant polytope is a convex @xmath9-cube ( or degeneration ) , with the @xmath8 facets providing boundary conditions for the @xmath9 functions of one variable determining the solution .",
    "in particular , by the uniqueness of toric extremal khler metrics  @xcite , we might _ expect _ a rational delzant polytope to select an essentially unique adapted factorization structure for the solution .",
    "this is indeed what happens for @xmath13 .",
    "the fruit of this analysis is theorem  [ thm : stability ] , which establishes , for quadrilaterals , donaldson s conjecture  @xcite that the existence of an extremal khler metric is equivalent to relative k - polystability with respect to toric degenerations .",
    "indeed , we show that temperate quadrilaterals admit a factorization structure which relates the polystability condition directly to the positivity of the quartics @xmath14 and @xmath15 appearing in the expression for the extremal ambitoric metrics .",
    "this explicitly computable criterion yields new examples both of extremal toric @xmath0-orbifolds , and of ( unstable ) toric @xmath0-orbifolds admitting no extremal khler metric .",
    "in our discussion of examples , we return to another motivation for ambitoric geometry : khler metrics which are conformally einstein . since the work of d.  page  @xcite and e.  calabi  @xcite , such metrics have been an important source of examples , with contributions by l.  brard - bergery  @xcite , r.  bryant  @xcite , a.  derdzinski  @xcite , g.  maschler  @xcite , and c.  lebrun  @xcite among others . in part",
    "i of this work  @xcite , we classified locally @xmath0-dimensional einstein metrics with degenerate half - weyl tensors using bach - flat ambitoric structures ( which are extremal and locally conformally einstein ) . here",
    "we show that bach - flat ambitoric @xmath0-orbifolds are abundant , and include examples which are globally conformally einstein , as well as examples with an open set where the khler metric is conformal to a smooth , complete ( conformally compact ) einstein metric on a covering .",
    "these extend in particular the examples of r.  bryant  @xcite    the organization is as follows . in section  [ s : toric - orb ]",
    "we review the theory of compact toric khler orbifolds  @xcite , but adopting an affine invariant viewpoint .",
    "we begin our analysis of quadrilaterals in section  [ s : sq ] where affine invariance provides an effective tool to compute , for example , the extremal vector field , without extensive calculus . by considering the affine structure as a variable",
    ", we similarly use projective invariance to simplify our later discussion of factorization structures .",
    "this approach is closely related to @xmath16-dimensional contact , cr and sasakian geometry , cf .",
    "@xcite , which we discuss in appendix  [ s : cr ] .",
    "the main results are established in sections  [ s : orbi - amb][s : ext - orbi - amb ] which concern the compactification of ambitoric metrics in general , in terms of _ factorization structures _ , and extremal ambitoric metrics in particular in terms of _ adapted factorization structures_. examples , including the new einstein metrics , are given in section  [ s : examples ] . in appendix",
    "[ s : semistablity ] , we study the k - semistability surface and show that any quadrilateral which is not a parallelogram can be made k - unstable for suitable choices of labels .    the first author was supported by an nserc discovery grant and the second ( partially ) by an advanced research fellowship .",
    "the authors are grateful to liana david and the centro georgi , pisa , for an opportunity to meet in 2006 , and to the simons institute , stony brook , for a workshop invitation in 2011 .",
    "they also thank miguel abreu , hugues auvray , olivier biquard , claude lebrun , veline legendre , gabor szkelyhidi and christina tnnessen - friedman for helpful discussions and comments .",
