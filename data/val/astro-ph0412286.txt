    "we have selected nearby edge - on oriented starburst galaxies to perform a multi - wavelength ( x - ray , radio - continuum , h and optical ) study of all phases of extraplanar gas to investigate the dependence of galactic halo properties on the energy input rate due to star formation ( sf ) in the underlying galactic disk .",
    "special care must be taken to separate halos created by a sufficiently high energy input and extra - planar emission which is caused by galactic interactions or nuclear activity .",
    "the galaxy s size , i.e. the depth of the gravitational potential , is another parameter affecting the evolution of galactic halos .",
    "one of the main goals of this project is the determination of the energy budget in the halos ( magnetic field , thermal and radiation energy densities ) .",
    "( @xcite ) x - ray observations presented here are used to detect previously unknown extended halo emission due to hot gas and/or to re - visit galaxies with known ( from earlier x - ray missions ) extra - planar x - ray emission features but now with a hitherto unreached sensitivity that can only be provided by deep   observations .",
    "such observations also allow us to investigate with unprecedented signal - to - noise the characteristics ( temperature , metallicity , energy density ) of the hot gas via x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "an earlier report on the status of our ongoing work was given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a more detailed motivation and general introduction of our multi - wavelength project can be found in the paper by m. dahlem ( this volume ) .",
    "this paper is based on  observations of the starburst galaxies ngc  1511 , ngc  4666 and ngc  3628 carried out as part of the guaranteed time proposal 011098 in july 2000 , june 2002 and november 2000 , respectively .",
    "the x - ray data have been cleaned for periods of high radiation background and images and spectra were generated with the science analysis system ( sas ) software package ( in its version 5.4.1 , except for ngc  1511 that was processed with 5.3.3 ) .",
    "we also made use of the epic background blank field files and tools provided by a. read @xcite .",
    "the starburst saa pec : h type galaxy ngc  1511 was studied as part of our project and x - ray results presented at this meeting have been published in @xcite .",
    "epic ( @xcite ) revealed for the first time the presence of a diffuse hot gaseous phase in ngc  1511 partly extending out of the disk plane .",
    "extra - planar emission due to cosmic rays and magnetic fields was earlier seen in radio continuum emission @xcite and is suggestive of a common origin for the outflow of these components of the ism .",
    "the x - ray spectral analysis of the integrated 0.2 - 12 kev emission ( excluding a strong point source about 30 north of the centre , which - if associated with ngc  1511 - might be an ultra - luminous @xmath0  erg s@xmath1 x - ray source ) showed a complex emission composition : one ( although not the only possible ) best - fitting model was found consisting of two thermal components and a power law contributing 12% ( 0.19 kev ) , 11% ( 0.59 kev ) and 77% ( powerl ) to the total flux , respectively .",
    "the finding that a spectral model with a single temperature gas component is not sufficient to describe the emission , points toward the fact that the x - ray emitting gas contains several phases .",
    "the best - fit model corresponding total x - ray luminosity ( @xmath2  erg s@xmath1 ) leads to a far - infrared - to - x - ray luminosity ratio for ngc  1511 which is typical for starburst galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical monitor ( om , @xcite ) on board  was used to observe ngc  1511 in the uv during the x - ray observations and obtained images showing that this galaxy is heavily disturbed ( as it also can be seen in h@xmath3 ( @xcite ) and in the near infra - red ) .",
    "strong evidence for tidal interactions has only recently been obtained through h observations @xcite , unfortunately rendering ngc  1511 unsuitable as target galaxy to study the dependence of its gaseous halo s properties on the distribution and level of sf in the underlying disk .",
    "based on multi - wavelength ( optical , radio continuum and  x - ray observations ) , we ` classified ' ngc  4666 as a ` superwind ' sc galaxy @xcite harboring an extra - planar outflow cone emanating from a central sf region of @xmath4  kpc in radius , and having an opening angle of @xmath5 .",
    "the outflow could be traced up to @xmath6  kpc above the disk plane by optical emission line filaments .",
    "the  x - ray observations ( @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_n4666_xray ] , left panel ) indicated the presence of soft extended x - ray emission outside of the disk on the north - western ( closer to us ) side of ngc  4666 .",
    "our  epic observation , in contrast , show for the first time that such soft x - ray emission exists on both sides of the galactic disk , originating from a huge , structured hot gas halo ( fig .",
    "[ fig_n4666_xray ] , right panel , and fig .",
    "[ fig_n4666_multi ] ) .",
    "the diffuse emission detected by epic - pn is strong enough to allow us to perform a spectral analysis in several areas in the galactic disk and halo : the complex spectrum of the diffuse disk emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , top ) can be fitted by a combination of an internally absorbed mekal ( 0.54  kev ) and power law component plus another mekal model ( 0.18  kev ) all affected by galactic foreground absorption . the lower halo emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , middle ) shows a similar spectral behavior as the disk spectrum .",
    "the spectrum of the upper halo emission ( fig .",
    "[ fig_n4666_pnspectrum ] , bottom ) , however , does not need a second mekal component but is fitted reasonably well also with a single 0.23  kev thermal plasma .",
    "most of the total flux above 0.9  kev originates from the power - law type emission ( presumably due to unresolved point - like sources ) , whereas the thermal plasma clearly dominates in the soft 0.3 - 0.9  kev band ( contributing 72% , 69% and 92% to the ` diffuse ' disk , lower and upper halo emission , respectively ) .",
    "if the diffuse x - ray emission in the soft energy band is assumed to be due to hot gas , it is possible to calculate the gas density @xmath7 and its mass @xmath8 . to this end",
    "we used the model of thermal cooling and ionization equilibrium of @xcite where @xmath9 .",
    "the unknown filling factor @xmath10 allows for some clumpiness of the gas .",
    "if we fit all the spectra extracted from the three areas with a single - temperature mekal model , the unabsorbed flux in the 0.3 - 12  kev and corresponding luminosity ( adopting @xmath11  mpc ) are given in tab .",
    "[ tab_n4666 ] . for the gas temperatures of the hot gas , @xcite give a cooling coefficient @xmath12 of @xmath13 erg @xmath14 s@xmath1 .",
    "assuming an ellipsoid for the disk and the outflow cone geometry ( see above ) for the emitting halo volume @xmath15 , and typical volume filling factors of 0.1 - 0.8 , we derive gas densities and masses listed in tab .",

[ tab_n4666 ] ) , and hence the magnetic field important for the dynamics of the hot gas ( ` channeling ' the outflow ) , in the lower halo the relatively high thermal energy density is supportive of the idea that in this region the gas outflow might easily take place , even against a disk - parallel magnetic field configuration .    a detailed analysis of the halo emission and a possible correlation with h@xmath3 and radio polarization filaments (",
    "as started in @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ fig_n4666_multi ] ) will be addressed in an upcoming paper by ehle et al . ; there we also plan to present a self - consistent dynamical and thermal spectral model @xcite which does no longer depend on the usual assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) .",
    "we note that the same  observations have been discussed by @xcite comparing the disk - emission with spatially unresolving _ bepposax _ data .",
    "the authors discuss their findings with respect to the discovery of starburst plus agn activity both contributing to the x - ray emission of ngc  4666 : the sf activity was found to be extended over most of the disk and associated with diffuse thermal emission , whereas the quite small low - luminosity type-2 agn contribution ( revealed by prominent k@xmath3 line emission from `` cold '' iron at 6.40  kev ) was detected from the nuclear region .    in ngc  4666 , @xcite failed to detect conclusive evidence for the existence of h gas in its halo .",
    "however , seen in their h maps are prominent tidal arms probably generated by interactions with the galaxy ngc  4668 and previously undetected dwarf companions .",
    "the high sf rate responsible for the superwind of ngc  4666 hence might be triggered by gravitational interaction .",
    "ngc  3628 is a peculiar sbc galaxy known to be an interacting member in the leo triplet ( arp 317 , assumed distance @xmath27  mpc ) .",
    "earlier x - ray observations with _ einstein _ @xcite and  ( @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig_n3628_rosat+xmm ] , left panel ) showed evidence for a collimated outflow along the minor axis from a starburst nucleus in ngc  3628 and led to the detection of an extended soft x - ray halo .",
    "our xmm - newton observations ( fig .",
    "[ fig_n3628_rosat+xmm ] , right panel ) are able to detect the extraplanar diffuse emission with much higher significance : the epic image clearly separates the southern collimated spur - like halo emission from nearby ( most possibly background ) point sources ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_n3628_xmm+opt ] , left panel ) and calls the proposed link between this x - ray filament and qsos @xcite to question .    a detailed comparison of the diffuse extraplanar x - ray emission with for example the h@xmath3 filaments ( a plume extending about 130 to the sw in position angle @xmath28 and faint more widespread filamentary extraplanar structures to the north - see h@xmath3 map from @xcite or @xcite and fig .  [ fig_n3628_xmm+opt ] , right panel ) is ongoing .",
    "in the framework of our multi - wavelength project to investigate gaseous halos around late - type spiral galaxies and their dependence on the level of star - formation activity in the underlying disks ( cf .",
    "m. dahlem ( this volume ) ) we showed in this paper x - ray results from three of our sample galaxies .",
    "the presented observations demonstrate that only with the advent of high sensitivity observatories ( like ) , it is becoming possible to detect and study in detail the hot halo gas component of the interstellar medium .",
    "our original sample selection criterion ( based on far infra - red colors , see @xcite and references therein ) , that showed to be a good tool to select candidates for the search for radio halos , is likely to also work in the x - ray regime . in all three  targets",
    "we find extra - planar x - ray emission which is bright enough to allow us detailed spectral investigations and also to test model assumptions ( i.e. collisional ionization equilibrium versus radiative cooling with the dynamics in full non - equilibrium ) .",
    "we note the co - existence of extra - planar soft x - ray emission above the most actively star forming regions in the galactic disk and the co - existence of such features with h@xmath3 filaments as well as vertical magnetic field structures ( in case of ngc  4666 ) .",
