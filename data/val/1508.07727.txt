    "the open nature of the wireless channel facilitates a multiuser transmission , but also incurs the security problem . recently , as a complement of traditional upper - layer encryption techniques , physical layer security ( phy - security ) has been proposed to realize secure communications by making use of the characteristics of wireless channels , i.e. , noise , fading and interference @xcite .    from an information - theoretic viewpoint ,",
    "the performance of phy - security is determined by the rate difference between the legitimate channel and the eavesdropper channel @xcite @xcite .",
    "therefore , to enhance wireless security , it makes sense to simultaneously increase the legitimate channel rate and decrease the eavesdropper channel rate .",
    "inspired by this , various physical layer techniques have been introduced to improve the secrecy performance .",
    "wherein , mimo relaying technique gains considerable attention due to the following two reasons .",
    "first , the relay can provide a diversity gain and shorten the accessing distance , and thus improve the secrecy performance @xcite .",
    "second , mimo techniques , such as spatial beamforming , can reduce the information leakage to the eavesdropper @xcite .",
    "the beamforming schemes at the mimo relay based on amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) relaying protocols were presented in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the optimal beam design at the relay requires global channel state information ( csi ) @xcite .",
    "yet , the csi , especially eavesdropper csi is difficult to obtain , since the eavesdropper is usually passive and keeps silent .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to realize absolutely secure communications over fading channels . in this",
    "context , statistical secrecy performance metrics , e.g. , secrecy outage capacity and interception probability , are adopted to evaluate wireless security @xcite .",
    "recently , an advanced mimo relaying technology , namely massive mimo ( m - mimo ) relaying , is introduced into secure communications to further improve the secrecy performance @xcite . even without eavesdropper csi ,",
    "m - mimo relaying can generate a very high - resolution spatial beam , and thus the information leakage to the eavesdropper is quite small .",
    "more importantly , the secrecy performance can be enhanced by simply adding more antennas . hence , the challenging issue of short - distance interception in secure communications can be well solved .",
    "note that in two - hop secure communications , the transmit power at the relay has a great impact on the secrecy performance , since it affects the signal quality at both the destination and the eavesdropper .",
    "an optimal power allocation scheme for a multi - carrier two - hop single - antenna relaying network was given in @xcite by maximizing the sum secrecy rate .",
    "however , the power allocation for a multi - antenna relay , especially an m - mimo relay , is still an open issue . in this paper",
    ", we focus on power allocation for df m - mimo secure relaying systems under very practical assumptions , i.e. , no eavesdropper csi and imperfect legitimate csi .",
    "the contributions of this paper are three - fold :    1 .   we reveal the relation between the secrecy outage capacity and a defined relative distance - dependent path loss , and then derive the condition for a nonnegative secrecy outage capacity and the constraint on the minimum number of antennas .",
    "we derive closed - form expressions for the optimal power at the relay in the sense of maximizing the secrecy outage capacity and minimizing the interception probability , respectively .",
    "we present clear insights into the secrecy performance through asymptotic analysis .",
    "we show that the maximum secrecy outage capacity is an increasing function of the source power while the minimum interception probability keeps constant .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first give an overview of the df m - mimo secure relaying system in section ii , and then derive two optimal power allocation schemes for the relay in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we present simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes .",
    "finally , we conclude the paper in section v.",
    "we consider a time division duplex ( tdd ) two - hop massive mimo ( m - mimo ) relaying system , where a single antenna source transmits message to a single antenna destination with the aid of a relay with @xmath0 antennas , while a passive single antenna eavesdropper intends to intercept the information .",
    "note that the number of antennas at the relay in such an m - mimo relaying system is quite large , i.e. , @xmath1 or even bigger .",
    "it is assumed that there is no direct transmission between the source and the destination due to a long propagation distance .",
    "the relay system works in a half - duplex mode , which means any successful transmission requires two time slots .",
    "specifically , the source sends the signal to the relay in the first time slot , and then the relay forwards the post - processing signal to the destination in the second time slot . in this paper , we assume the eavesdropper is far from the source and close to the relay , since it was concluded that the signal comes from the relay directly .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the eavesdropper only monitors the transmission from the relay to the destination .",
    "we use @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 to represent the channels from the source to the relay , the relay to the destination , and the relay to the eavesdropper , respectively , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the distance - dependent path losses and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denote the channel fading coefficient vectors with independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero mean and unit variance complex gaussian entries .",
    "it is assumed that the channels remain constant during a time slot and fade independently over slots .",
    "thus , the received signal at the relay in the first time slot can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the normalized gaussian distributed transmit symbol , @xmath13 is the transmit power at the source , and @xmath14 stands for the additive white gaussian noise with unit variance at the relay .",
    "we assume that the relay has perfect csi about @xmath8 by channel estimation .",
    "then , maximum ratio combination ( mrc ) decoding is performed to recover the information .",
    "specifically , the received signal is multiplied by a vector @xmath15 .    during the second time slot",
    ", the relay forwards the decoded signal @xmath16 through maximum ratio transmission ( mrt ) .",
    "we assume that the relay has partial csi about @xmath9 due to channel reciprocity impairment in tdd systems .",
    "the relation between the estimated csi @xmath17 and the real csi @xmath9 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the error vector with i.i.d .",
    "zero mean and unit variance complex gaussian entries , and is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath20 , scaling from @xmath21 to @xmath22 , is the correlation coefficient between @xmath17 and @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the received signals at the destination and the eavesdropper are given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively , where @xmath25 is the transmit power of the relay , @xmath26 is the forwarded signal with @xmath27 being a mrt beamforming vector . @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29 are additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) samples with unit variance at the destination and the eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "in this section , we aim to optimize the secrecy performance through allocating the relay power @xmath25 , since it affects the signal quality at both the destination and the eavesdropper .",
    "in what follows , we analyze and design the power allocation schemes in the sense of maximizing the secrecy outage capacity and minimizing the interception probability , respectively .      based on the received signal in ( [ eqn1 ] ) , when performing mrc decoding at the relay , the channel capacity from the source to the relay can be expressed as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the spectral bandwidth and",
    "@xmath32 is the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "similarly , according to ( [ eqn3 ] ) and ( [ eqn4 ] ) , channel capacities from the relay to the destination and from the relay to the eavesdropper are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then , for the secrecy outage capacity in a df m - mimo secrecy relaying system , we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 1 _ : given an outage probability bound by @xmath37 , the secrecy outage capacity is approximated as @xmath38 , when the number of relay antennas is large",
    ".    please refer to appendix i.    note that the secrecy outage capacity may be negative from a pure mathematical view .",
    "hence , it makes sense to find the condition that the secrecy outage capacity is nonnegative .    for notional simplicity ,",
    "we let @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is defined as the relative distance - dependent path loss .",
    "then , the secrecy outage capacity can be rewritten as    @xmath41    observing the above secrecy outage capacity , we get the following theorem :    _ theorem 2 _ : if and only if @xmath42 , the secrecy outage capacity in such a df m - mimo secure relaying system in presence of imperfect csi is nonnegative",
    ".    please refer to appendix ii .",
    "notice that @xmath42 is the precondition for power allocation in such a secure relaying system . given channel conditions and outage probability requirements , in order to fulfill @xmath43 ,",
    "the number of antennas @xmath0 must be bigger than @xmath44 . for an m - mimo relaying system",
    ", it is always possible to meet the condition of @xmath42 by adding more antennas , which is one of its main advantages . in what follows",
    ", we only consider the case of @xmath42 .",
    "based on theorem 1 , the secrecy outage capacity maximization power allocation is equivalent to the following optimization problem : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the transmit power constraint at the relay .    for the optimal solution of the above optimization problem , we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 3 _ : the optimal power at the relay is @xmath47 , and the corresponding maximum secrecy outage capacity is @xmath48 .",
    "please refer to appendix iii .",
    "_ remark _ : it is found that when eavesdropper csi is unavailable , it is optimal for the df secure relaying system to let the two hops have the same channel capacity , resulting in @xmath47 .      in this subsection",
    ", we analyze the optimal power allocation from the perspective of minimizing the interception probability . in general ,",
    "interception probability is defined as the probability of information leakage , namely the probability of @xmath49 .",
    "then , interception probability is equivalent to the secrecy outage probability when @xmath50 in ( [ equ5 ] ) .",
    "thus , it can be computed as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the legitimate channel capacity .",
    "then , interception probability minimization power allocation can be described as the following optimization problem : @xmath53 since @xmath54 is a monotonously increasing function of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is equivalent to @xmath57 , @xmath58 can be transformed to the following problem : @xmath59 @xmath60 by solving the above optimization problem , we have the following theorem :    _ theorem 4 _ : from the perspective of minimizing interception probability , the optimal transmit power at the relay @xmath61 belongs to a region @xmath62 $ ] , and the corresponding minimum interception probability is @xmath63",
    ".    please refer to appendix iv .",
    "_ remarks _ : it is found that the optimal power minimizing the interception probability is not unique .",
    "however , from the perspective of maximizing the secrecy outage capacity , @xmath64 , namely the upper bound , is optimal .",
    "thus , it is better to let @xmath47 in the sense of jointly optimizing interception probability and secrecy outage capacity .      in the above",
    ", we prove that the optimal relay power @xmath61 in the sense of maximizing the secrecy outage capacity and minimizing the interception probability is a function of the source power @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the source power has a great impact on the secrecy performance , as described in theorem 3 and 4 . in order to get some clear insights , we carry out an asymptotic performance analysis with respect to the source power .",
    "first , for the secrecy outage capacity in a df m - mimo secrecy relaying system , there are the following asymptotic characteristics :    _ proposition 1 _ : in the low @xmath13 regime , the optimal relay power @xmath65 and maximum secrecy outage capacity @xmath66 asymptotically approach zero . in the high @xmath13 regime , the maximum secrecy outage capacity will be saturated and is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath66 is an increasing function of @xmath13 .    in the low @xmath13 regime , the optimal relay power and the corresponding secrecy outage capacity",
    "are reduced as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . both of them asymptotically approach zero as @xmath13 tends to zero .",
    "otherwise , in the high @xmath13 regime , the optimal relay power is limited by @xmath46 , then @xmath66 is constant . in other words ,",
    "the secrecy outage capacity becomes saturated .",
    "in addition , because of @xmath42 , @xmath66 is an increasing function of @xmath13 .",
    "second , for the interception probability , we have the following asymptotic characteristics :    _ proposition 2 _ : the minimum interception probability is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "as proved in theorem 4 , although the optimal relay power is a function of the source power , the final interception probability is a constant independent of @xmath13 and @xmath25 .",
    "to examine the effectiveness of the proposed power allocation schemes for df m - mimo secure relaying systems , we present several simulation results for the following scenarios .",
    "we set @xmath1 , @xmath69 khz , @xmath70 and @xmath71 without extra statements . for convenience ,",
    "we normalize the path loss from the source to the relay as @xmath72 and use @xmath6 and @xmath73 to denote the relative path loss .",
    "specifically , @xmath74 means that the eavesdropper is closer to the relay than the destination .",
    "in addition , we use snr@xmath75 , snr@xmath76 and snr@xmath77 to represent the snr in db at the source , the relay and the constraint at the relay , respectively .",
    "first , we verify the accuracy of the theoretical expression in theorem 1 with snr@xmath78 snr@xmath79 db and @xmath80 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the theoretical results are well consistent with the simulations in the whole @xmath7 region with different outage probability requirements , which proves the high accuracy of the derived results . given an outage probability bound by @xmath37 , as @xmath7 increases",
    ", the secrecy outage capacity decreases gradually .",
    "this is because the interception ability of the eavesdropper enhances due to the short interception distance .",
    "in addition , for a given @xmath7 , the secrecy outage capacity improves with the increase of @xmath37 , since the outage probability is an increasing function of the secrecy outage capacity .",
    "next , we show the performance gain of the proposed optimal power allocation schemes compared to a fixed power allocation with snr@xmath81 db , snr@xmath82 db and @xmath83 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the fixed scheme uses a fixed power @xmath84 db regardless of channel conditions and system parameters . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the secrecy outage capacity maximization power allocation scheme performs better than the fixed power allocation scheme . especially in the high @xmath6 regime ,",
    "the performance of the proposed scheme improves sharply , while that of the fixed allocation scheme nearly remains unchanged .",
    "this is because the legitimate channel capacity is limited by the source - relay channel capacity under this condition , but the fixed scheme is regardless of @xmath5 and @xmath13 . in the low @xmath6 regime",
    ", the secrecy outage capacities of both schemes approach zero due to @xmath85 , which verifies theorem 2 again . in terms of interception probability , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the proposed scheme also outperforms the fixed power allocation scheme .",
    "consistent with the theoretical claims , the interception probability approaches zero when @xmath6 is large enough .",
    ".,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    finally , we check the asymptotic characteristics with @xmath80 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , as @xmath13 tends to zero , the maximum secrecy capacities with different @xmath7 approach zero . in the large @xmath13 regime ,",
    "the maximum secrecy outage capacity will be saturated , which is in agreement with proposition 1 again . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , it is seen that the minimum interception probability is independent of @xmath13 .",
    "additionally , the interception probability floor becomes higher with the increase of @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper , we have first presented a secrecy performance analysis for a df m - mimo secure relaying system with imperfect csi .",
    "we proved that in order to guarantee a nonnegative secrecy outage capacity , there is a constraint on the minimum number of antennas at the relay .",
    "then , by maximizing the secrecy outage capacity and minimizing the interception probability , we proposed two optimal relay power allocation schemes . at last , we revealed the asymptotic characteristics of maximum secrecy outage capacity and minimum interception probability with respect to the source power .",
    "based on channel capacities from the source to the relay in ( [ eqn7 ] ) and from the relay to the destination in ( [ eqn10 ] ) , the legitimate channel capacity can be computed as @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 denotes the real part of @xmath55 . @xmath9 has been replaced with @xmath89 in ( [ equ2 ] ) .",
    "( [ equ3 ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath90 scales with the order @xmath91 as @xmath92 while @xmath93 scales as the order @xmath94 , which is negligible .",
    "( [ equ4 ] ) holds true because of @xmath95 and @xmath96 , namely channel hardening @xcite .",
    "similarly , the eavesdropper channel capacity is given by @xmath97    then , the secrecy outage probability @xmath37 with respect to a secrecy outage capacity @xmath98 can be computed as ( [ equ5 ] ) at the top of next page ,    @xmath99    where ( [ app2 ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath100 is @xmath101 distributed with 2 degrees of freedom , and ( [ equ5 ] ) holds true since @xmath102 approaches zero when @xmath0 is sufficient large .",
    "based on ( [ equ5 ] ) , it is easy to get the theorem 1 .",
    "based on the secrecy outage capacity in theorem 1 , when @xmath103 , we have @xmath104 . to guarantee @xmath105",
    ", the following condition @xmath106 must be fulfilled , which is equivalent to @xmath42 in the case of @xmath107 .    otherwise , when @xmath108 , the secrecy outage capacity is changed as @xmath109 . only when @xmath42 , @xmath110 is nonnegative .    above all",
    ", @xmath42 or @xmath111 is the precondition that the nonnegative secrecy outage capacity exists .",
    "therefore , we get the theorem 2 .",
    "according to the theorem 1 , when @xmath112 , the secrecy outage capacity @xmath104 is maximized when @xmath113 , since @xmath110 is a monotonously decreasing function of @xmath25 .    when @xmath108 , the secrecy outage capacity @xmath114 is an increasing function of @xmath25 under the condition @xmath42 .",
    "thus , @xmath113 is the optimal power at the relay .    considering the constraint on the transmit power @xmath46 at the relay ,",
    "the optimal power at the relay is @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , by substituting @xmath47 into the expression of secrecy outage capacity , we can obtain the maximum secrecy outage capacity as shown in theorem 3 .",

    "hence , the optimal solution of @xmath120 can be an arbitrary value belonging to @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "second , when @xmath103 , the optimization problem @xmath116 is reduced as @xmath121 @xmath122 the optimal solution of @xmath123 is @xmath124 , since the objective function is a decreasing function of @xmath25 .                c. jeong , i - m .",
