    "multiple scattering of waves is an important topic involved in many branches of physics , from atomic physics to astronomy via condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "one of its most fascinating aspects occurs when interference effects persist in the presence of disorder .",
    "these interference effects manifest themselves through deviations from the usual diffusive behaviour obtained at long times ( weak localization ) . under suitable conditions they can even completely inhibit transport ( strong localization ) reaching an insulating regime . during the last two decades , both the weak and strong localization regimes have been extensively studied with systems ranging from electronic waves to ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "coherent multiple scattering of light in cold atomic clouds has been experimentally and theoretically studied since ten years in the context of the coherent backscattering ( cbs ) effect @xcite .",
    "compared to classical scattering media , such as semi - conducting powders , cold atoms confined in a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) constitute quite a unique sample of identical strongly - resonant point - like scatterers @xcite . a key feature of the atomic scatterers is the presence of quantum internal degrees of freedom when their ground state is degenerate i.e. possesses a non - zero angular momentum @xcite .",
    "these internal degrees of freedom are coupled to the polarization of light waves during single scattering events . as they are traced out when one observes the interference pattern of light , light experiences decoherence during its diffusive propagation in the atomic cloud .",
    "this leads to a reduction of the interference between scattering amplitudes as exemplified by the cbs contrast @xcite .",
    "the saturation of the atomic transition @xcite and the finite temperature of the atomic gas @xcite are two additional mechanisms reducing the coherence of light .",
    "to restore the contrast of the interferences , it has been suggested to use a polarized atomic gas @xcite . unfortunately , this method is efficient only in optically thin clouds .",
    "another possibility is to break the degeneracy of the atomic ground state by applying an external magnetic field @xmath3 , which is one of the topics we address here .",
    "in classical scattering media , the presence of an external magnetic field is known to modify the interference pattern and to reduce the cbs interference contrast @xcite .",
    "the mechanism at work here is the modification of the polarization of light during its coherent propagation due to the faraday effect @xcite .",
    "as this modification is not the same along a scattering path and its reversed partner , a dephasing process takes place between the scattering amplitudes associated to these two paths , scrambling in turn their interference .",
    "although the magneto - optical effects are very strong in cold atomic gases @xcite , they actually have a negligible impact on the shape of the interference pattern itself @xcite .",
    "more surprisingly , a full restoration of the interference contrast is even possible under well chosen conditions @xcite . in this article",
    ", we give a detailed explanation of this result .",
    "we present a general , non - perturbative study of the interaction between a cold atomic cloud and quasi - resonant light in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_scat ]",
    ", we derive the scattering operator of a single atom exposed to monochromatic quasi - resonant light in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath3 and we analyze the differential and total cross - section . in section [ sec_prop ]",
    ", we address the coherent propagation of light and derive the refraction index tensor of the effective medium . in particular , birefringence and magneto - optical effects are studied in [ susec_bif ] and [ susec_mo ] .",
    "the cbs interference effect under a magnetic field is discussed in section [ sec_cbsb ] and the restoration of the cbs contrast is studied in section [ sec_rest ] .",
    "we consider the situation where a gas of identical atoms , with spatial density @xmath4 , is both exposed to a uniform external magnetic field @xmath3 and a monochromatic light plane wave with wavelength @xmath5 , wavevector @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , angular frequency @xmath8 ( we use units such that @xmath9 ) and transverse polarization @xmath10 .",
    "we first assume that the average distance between atoms is much larger than the wavelength @xmath5 of the light wave , @xmath11 , meaning that multiple scattering processes take place in the dilute regime . in this case",
    "a semi - classical description is appropriate and propagation of light in the atomic medium is well described by partial waves propagating along classical multiple scattering paths .",
    "each path consists in a succession of independent scattering events by a _ single _ atom , separated by propagation in an effective medium with refractive index @xmath12 .",
    "to further properly describe scattering of light by one single atom , we assume that @xmath13 is very close to the transition frequency @xmath14 between the atom internal groundstate ( with total angular momentum @xmath15 ) and an internal excited state ( with angular momentum @xmath16 ) , hereby considering the case of _ quasi - resonant _ scattering . introducing the light detuning @xmath17 , this condition reads @xmath18 .",
    "we further assume that this transition is _ closed _ ( the excited state with life time @xmath19 can only decay by spontaneous emission into the groundstate ) and well _ isolated _ from any other allowed transition connecting the groundstate to any other hyperfine levels .",
    "this is experimentally achieved for instance in the case of the @xmath20 transition of the d2 line of @xmath21rb @xcite .",
    "the total atom - light hamiltonian @xmath22 is the sum of the free atom - light hamiltonian @xmath23 and of the interaction term @xmath24 describing the coupling of the light modes to the atomic degrees of freedom . when no magnetic field is applied , the interaction between light and one single atom is well documented @xcite and we thus simply need to incorporate the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "we will assume here that weak fields are applied to the gas so that the linear zeeman effect is the relevant physical description .",
    "as the magnetic field only affects the energy levels of the atom , the free atom - light hamiltonian @xmath23 just reads : @xmath25 here @xmath26 mhz / gauss is the bohr magneton and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the land factors of the ground and excited states respectively . in the following",
    "we will choose @xmath3 to be along axis @xmath29 which we choose as the quantification axis for the internal zeeman states of the atom .",
    "then @xmath30 is the projector onto the excited state where @xmath31 denotes an atomic state of angular momentum @xmath16 and magnetic quantum number @xmath32 referred to axis @xmath29 .    to be consistent with our approximations , the zeeman shifts ( of order @xmath33 )",
    "must be much smaller than the energy difference between any other atomic hyperfine levels .",
    "still these shifts can be sufficiently large to fully split the zeeman structure and strongly modify the light scattering properties of the atom .",
    "indeed , as exemplified by the case of rubidium atoms , zeeman shifts comparable to the excited - state frequency width ( @xmath34 mhz ) , are achieved with moderate field strengths of @xmath35 gauss .    as usual",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 in ( [ eq_h0 ] ) are the annihilation and creation operators of the electric field mode with wavevector @xmath6 , polarization @xmath38 and frequency @xmath39 .",
    "we further assume that the light wavelength is much larger than the size of the relevant atom electronic wavefunctions .",
    "the interaction between light and an atom located at position @xmath40 is then accounted for in the dipolar approximation and reads @xmath41 .",
    "the atomic electric dipole operator writes @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the operator describing transitions from the ground state to the excited state . here",
    "@xmath44 is the projector onto the groundstate sector with @xmath45 an atomic state of angular momentum @xmath15 and magnetic quantum number @xmath46 referred to axis @xmath29 .",
    "the transverse radiation field operator reads @xmath47 where : @xmath48 describes photon annihilation in all possible field modes .",
    "the field strength is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the quantization box volume ( it disappears at the end of all physical calculations ) .    the dipolar interaction operator @xmath24 describes the possibility for the atom to absorb or emit a photon changing at the same time its internal state @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "as the incident light is nearly resonant with the atomic transition , we only need to consider resonant contributions where the atom in its ground state can only absorb a photon , and the atom in its excited state can only emit a photon : @xmath53 this is known as the rotating wave approximation .",
    "it has to be noticed that the photons considered in this article are associated to the _ transverse _ electric field , i.e. to the electric displacement vector @xmath54 and not to the electric field @xmath55 ( hence our notation ) @xcite .",
    "this point is important for two reasons : first , due to the magnetic field , light propagates in an anisotropic medium where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are no longer colinear and , second , former theoretical studies treated the propagation of @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "starting from the incident state @xmath56 , describing a photon @xmath57 impinging an atom located at @xmath40 with initial ground state @xmath45 , we consider the scattering process leading to the final state @xmath58 , describing a scattered photon @xmath59 leaving the atom in the final ground state @xmath60 .",
    "the probability amplitude for such a transition is the matrix element @xmath61 of the scattering operator @xmath62 acting on the atom - photon hilbert space @xmath63 .",
    "the transition operator for an atomic point - dipole scatterer writes @xmath64 where @xmath65 couples the photon polarization to the atomic internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the ( on - shell ) matrix elements of @xmath66 are : @xmath67 where the delta distribution ensures energy conservation . for the initial and final states under consideration , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "it is important to note at this point that , contrary to the case where there is no magnetic field , scattering has now become _ inelastic _ , a feature that will complicate greatly the analysis of the multiple scattering situation . indeed",
    "as soon as @xmath70 , the atom experiences a net zeeman energy change . in turn , the angular frequency of the scattered photon is accordingly modified to @xmath71 .",
    "it should be noted that we simplified here the problem further by neglecting momentum transfer to the atom during scattering .",
    "this approximation , supposedly valid when the recoil energy is negligible compared to the energy width of the excited state , becomes nevertheless questionable when considering the multiple scattering regime as studied ( without magnetic field ) in @xcite .",
    "the matrix element @xmath72 is calculated from @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the green s function of the system when the atom is in its excited state .",
    "this operator can be computed by using resolvent techniques @xcite and we find : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the angular width of the atomic excited state due to coupling to vacuum fluctuations . technically speaking , there is also a modification of the atomic frequency ( lamb - shift ) that we get rid off by a proper re - definition of @xmath14 .",
    "it is noteworthy that neither the lamb - shift nor the linewidth depend on @xmath3 .",
    "this is so because the zeeman operators do not couple to the dipole interaction @xmath24 .    introducing the reduced atomic dipole operator @xmath77 with @xmath78 @xcite ,",
    "the internal transition matrix element then reads : @xmath79 where the dyadic transition operator in polarization space @xmath80 is : @xmath81 the dimensionless parameter @xmath82 where @xmath83 quantifies the impact of @xmath3 on the atomic scattering properties and is generally complex - valued except at resonance ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "one can note in passing that , when @xmath2 , @xmath85 which describes the usual absorption and emission cycle from the degenerate groundstate @xcite .",
    "probability conservation assures that , under the scattering process , any incident photon is either transmitted in the same mode or scattered in another mode .",
    "this is the essence of the optical theorem , which relates the total scattering cross section of the atom to the forward scattering amplitude : @xmath86 where @xmath87 indicates an average over the initial atomic internal degrees of freedom . as such @xmath88 only acts on the photon degrees on freedom . at this point",
    ", we make the important simplifying assumption that the initial atomic density operator @xmath89 describes a complete incoherent mixture of the groundstate zeeman sub - states .",
    "this is generally the situation for cold atoms prepared in an optically thick magneto - optical trap ( mot ) where all zeeman states are uniformly populated and no zeeman coherence is achieved .",
    "the initial atomic density operator then reads @xmath90 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath91 , @xmath10 and @xmath92 are irreducible tensors of rank 1 , one can express @xmath93 in terms of the irreducible components of the tensor @xmath94 in the cartesian basis set @xmath95 . introducing the dyadic projector @xmath96 onto the plane perpendicular to @xmath97 , we find : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a factor taking care of the degeneracies of the ground and excited states . both projectors @xmath100 and",
    "@xmath101 ensure that polarization vectors always remain transverse to the direction of propagation .    using the totally antisymmetric tensor of rank 3 @xmath102 ( @xmath103 )",
    ", the dyadic tensor @xmath104 reads : @xmath105 with the z - axis chosen along @xmath106 , the matrix representing @xmath104 is : @xmath107 the @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 coefficients depend on @xmath111 and on the clebsch - gordan coefficients of the atomic transition @xcite : @xmath112 as is expected from onsager s reciprocity relations @xcite , one can check that @xmath108 and @xmath110 are even function of @xmath111 , while @xmath109 is an odd function of @xmath111 .",
    "it can be checked that all these three coefficients are real at resonance ( @xmath84 ) since @xmath113 is then real . in the case of a @xmath114 transition ( @xmath115 ) , these coefficients read @xmath116    the dyadic tensor @xmath104 embodies the effect of the magnetic field on the photon polarization degrees of freedom and gives rise to the usual magneto - optical effects .",
    "the @xmath108 term is responsible for normal extinction ( lambert - beer law ) .",
    "the @xmath109 term describes the magnetically - induced rotation of the atomic dipole moment ( hanle effect ) @xcite and induces faraday rotation and dichroism effects observed when @xmath117 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath110 term is responsible for the cotton - mouton effect observed when @xmath118 @xcite .",
    "+ from expression ( [ eq_tint ] ) and the optical theorem ( [ eq_optheo ] ) we deduce the total scattering cross section of a photon by an atom initially prepared in an incoherent mixture of zeeman internal ground states : @xmath119 where @xmath120 in the case of a @xmath114 transition ( @xmath115 ) , and for resonant light ( @xmath84 ) , the scattering cross section boils down to the simpler form : @xmath121 as one can see , in the presence of a magnetic field , the total scattering cross section depends explicitly on the incident polarization @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , it depends on the relative direction of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "we recover here the well - known fact that an external magnetic field induces optical anisotropy in otherwise isotropic media . in the absence of a magnetic field",
    ", @xmath104 reduces to the identity matrix @xmath122 and we get @xmath123 , giving back the result found in @xcite .",
    "our previous calculation in fact just considered the scattering of _ one _ quasi - resonant photon by one atom assumed to be initially prepared in an incoherent mixture of zeeman internal ground states . in a real experiment however , many quasi - resonant photons are shone . for a given incident polarization",
    ", the repeated scattering of photons by the atom induces changes in the populations of the groundstate zeeman sublevels and creates coherences between them .",
    "this effect is known as optical pumping and is enhanced in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "our previous calculations thus applies to the case where optical pumping can be neglected .",
    "this is the situation considered in section [ sec_rest ] .",
    "one can note however that our results can be easily extended to include optical pumping .",
    "indeed , the most general tensor of rank 2 that can be written with the components of @xmath3 is still given by expression ( [ dyadict ] ) but with arbitrary coefficients now .",
    "thus equations ( [ eq_tint ] ) , ( [ eq_tf ] ) and ( [ eq_sigma ] ) remain valid . only the detailed expressions ( [ eq_coefs ] ) of @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110",
    "will be modified . in the following , all our analytical results are expressed in terms of these three coefficients . they thus remain valid in the presence of optical pumping if the coefficients are given their appropriate expressions and values .",
    "we now turn to the impact of @xmath3 on the radiation pattern of the atom .",
    "the intensity of light scattered in the direction @xmath124 with polarization @xmath125 while the atom changes its internal state from @xmath45 to @xmath60 is proportional to the differential scattering cross section @xmath126 starting with an atom prepared in state @xmath45 the differential cross - section for a photon to be scattered in mode @xmath127 is thus : @xmath128 the total photon scattering cross - section is then obtained by averaging over the initial internal atomic density matrix , which we assumed to describe a fully incoherent mixture of groundstate zeeman sublevels .",
    "we thus arrive at : @xmath129 when the ground state is non - degenerate ( @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath115 ) , the tensors @xmath132 and @xmath133 coincide and the differential cross section takes the simple form : @xmath134 with @xmath135 the coefficients @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 being given by ( [ coef=0 ] )",
    ".    since the resonant denominator in ( [ eq_t ] ) explicitly depends on the magnetic quantum numbers @xmath46 and @xmath32 , standard irreducible tensor methods @xcite are of little practical use to boil down the total differential cross - section ( [ eq_avdsec ] ) to a much simpler form .",
    "however it can be easily and efficiently computed for any transition line by using the symbolic calculus software _ maple_. as a humorous note , the reader is invited to appreciate the power of the optical theorem by deriving the total scattering cross section ( [ eq_sigma ] ) by direct computation from ( [ eq_avdsec ] ) .",
    "the propagation of an incident light field mode @xmath136 in a scattering medium , also known as the coherent propagation , is efficiently described by replacing the scattering medium by a homogeneous effective medium having a complex refractive index tensor @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath2 , @xmath12 is a scalar and bears no action on the incident polarization .",
    "its imaginary part gives rise to an exponential attenuation ( lambert - beer law ) , its characteristic length scale being known as the extinction length . since true absorption ( i. e. conversion of electromagnetic energy into another form of energy ) is absent in our case , depletion of the incident mode can only occur through scattering .",
    "the extinction length thus identifies with the scattering mean free path @xmath137 and one has @xmath138 .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field @xmath3 modifies the interaction between light and atoms and the coherent propagation of light in the atomic cloud will be accordingly altered .",
    "as @xmath3 induces a preferential orientation of space , it will set an optical anisotropy in the atomic gas . in this case , the refractive index tensor is no longer a scalar and will act on the polarization space : the coherent propagation of light will exhibit birefringence and magneto - optical effects .",
    "these magneto - optical effects are well documented in the literature @xcite : for a given wavevector @xmath6 , there are two eigen - polarization modes propagating in ( possibly ) different directions , with different velocities and attenuations .    in this paragraph , we extend the techniques developed in @xcite and @xcite to the case of atoms with a degenerate ground state .",
    "we will always assume that the atomic gas is dilute .",
    "in this case , @xmath139 ( @xmath4 being the number density ) , and @xmath140 . furthermore , since for resonant scatterers @xmath141 is at most of the order of @xmath142 , @xmath137 will be always much larger than the average interatomic distance @xmath143 . as a whole , for point - dipole resonant scatterers ,",
    "the dilute medium condition @xmath139 implies the condition @xmath144 .",
    "the properties of the effective medium will then be directly related to the individual scattering properties of the atoms under the magnetic field .",
    "the first step to find the refractive index tensor @xmath12 and describe the coherent propagation of light is to determine the green s function for light once all atomic degrees of freedom have been averaged out .",
    "let @xmath145 be the total number of atoms in the gas and their respective positions be labeled by @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system @xmath148atoms + light@xmath149 is @xmath150 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are given by expressions ( [ eq_h0 ] ) and ( [ eq_u ] ) .",
    "the green s functions of the whole system @xmath151 and of the uncoupled system @xmath152 satisfy the recursive equation @xmath153 since we are interested in the situation where all atoms start and end in their groundstate , we merely look for the green s function projected onto the atomic groundstate manifold @xmath154 . in this case , only expansion terms containing @xmath155 an even number of times can contribute .",
    "the average over the atomic degrees of freedom will generate a dyson equation for the average green s function @xmath156 . under the dilute medium assumption , and since all atoms are identical and uniformly distributed in space ( at least on the scale of the scattering mean free path ) , the corresponding self - energy is given by @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the transition operator of the @xmath159-th atom .",
    "the average over the internal degrees of freedom is given by ( [ eq_tint ] ) .",
    "the matrix elements of the average photon green s function are then given by : @xmath160 where @xmath161 .",
    "the kronecker symbol @xmath162 features the restoration of translation invariance under the spatial average .",
    "the self - energy tensor @xmath163 contains all the information on the effective medium .",
    "it has an explicit dependence on the incident direction because , in the presence of the magnetic field , the scattering medium develops an optical anisotropy ( see section [ susec_scatcross ] ) .",
    "the equation ( [ eq_gk ] ) receives a simple interpretation in a basis where @xmath163 is diagonal .",
    "it corresponds to polarization modes which propagate in direction @xmath164 without deformation .",
    "the poles of @xmath165 then give the corresponding dispersion relation for the eigenmode .",
    "trivially , @xmath6 is an eigenvector of @xmath166 with eigenvalue 0 .",
    "this is a consequence of the transversality of light , and this eigenvector is not physically relevant . to find the other complex eigenmodes and complex eigenvalues , @xmath167",
    ", we parametrize @xmath164 by its spherical angles @xmath168 and @xmath169 in a coordinate frame with z - axis parallel to @xmath106 .",
    "we find : @xmath170 their explicit dependance on the angle @xmath168 between @xmath106 and @xmath164 expresses the optical anisotropy of the atomic cloud induced by the magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding eigenmodes are : @xmath171 to allow a relative ease of reading , these vectors have not been normalized .",
    "one difficulty arises when @xmath172 for non - vanishing @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this situation can only happen if @xmath109 and @xmath110 are real , thus for @xmath111 real , i. e. at resonance ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the solutions are of the form ( @xmath173 ) , which means , because of the invariance around the z - axis , that the photon has to propagate along a cone of apex @xmath174 . when this is the case , @xmath175 but @xmath176 , and the self - energy is non - diagonalizable .",
    "however this situation is largely unphysical in the sense that it arises from the first - order approximation in the atomic density used to compute @xmath163 . at next order in density",
    ", this difficulty disappears .",
    "however , this could lead to intersting effects for the propagation of light near the apex angle .",
    "we chose to neglect such effects in the following .",
    "noticeably , @xmath177 and @xmath178 are not orthogonal vectors in general .",
    "indeed , scattering depletes the coherent mode and its energy decays .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the self - energy is not a hermitian operator .",
    "thus its eigenvectors have no reason to be orthogonal .",
    "when @xmath2 , @xmath104 reduces to the identity and @xmath163 is then proportional to the projector @xmath100 . in this case alone , all polarization states orthogonal to @xmath6 are eigenmodes and it is then possible to choose an orthogonal basis .",
    "one can however note that @xmath177 and @xmath178 are nearly orthogonal when @xmath179 or when @xmath180 .",
    "this happens in the limit of small or strong magnetic fields ( @xmath181 , @xmath182 ) , or at a very large detuning ( @xmath183 ) .      in the polarization eigenbasis ,",
    "the poles of the green s function ( [ eq_gk ] ) give the dispersion relation for @xmath184 .",
    "we find : @xmath185 the refraction index tensor @xmath12 is diagonal in the polarization eigenbasis and the polarization vectors @xmath184 propagate each with different complex refractive indexes : @xmath186 since @xmath187 . as a consequence ,",
    "the two eigen - polarizations propagate with different phase velocities and experience different attenuations ( dichroism ) . in turn , the effective medium acts as an absorbing polarization filter for the incoming light .",
    "the index mismatch between the two eigen - polarizations is @xmath188 and vanishes for @xmath189 , i. e. when the two eigen - polarizations collapse onto each other , rendering the refractive index tensor no longer diagonalizable .",
    "let us consider a polarized monochromatic wave packet propagating in the atomic cloud with a central wavevector @xmath6 , and let us assume the polarization is one of the vectors @xmath184 .",
    "then the maximum of the wave packet propagates with the group velocity @xmath190 .",
    "as @xmath191 depends on the angle @xmath168 between @xmath3 and @xmath6 , @xmath192 possesses a component orthogonal to @xmath6 : in general , the wave packet does not propagate parallel to the wavevector .",
    "since each polarization eigen - mode has its own direction of propagation , a birefringence effect takes place , as is well known in anisotropic media @xcite .",
    "this magnetically - induced birefringence has already been observed @xcite , though under conditions differing from the ones described in the present article .",
    "we have checked that , provided @xmath193 is not much larger than @xmath33 , the deviation of the wave packet from the direction of @xmath6 is negligible : the walk - off angle remains smaller than @xmath194 @xcite .",
    "birefringence effects will thus be neglected in the following .      to study the propagation properties of the coherent mode in the atomic cloud , we need the green s function of light in real space , @xmath195 .",
    "it is the fourier transform of @xmath165 ( [ eq_gk ] ) : @xmath196 neglecting birefringence effects , the angular part of the integral can be calculated with a stationary phase approximation around the direction @xmath197 : @xmath198 the @xmath199 integral has an ultra - violet divergence ( @xmath200 ) which needs to be regularized .",
    "it expresses that the interaction between two atoms separated by less than one optical wavelength can not be reduced to the exchange of one resonant photon .",
    "the divergent part of the integral comes from the contact term of the radiated field @xcite .",
    "as the average interatomic distance is much larger than the optical wavelength , we are interested only in the far - field component .",
    "the latter can be obtained from the regular part of ( [ eq_grrad ] ) and calculated with the help of the residue theorem .",
    "the final result reads : @xmath201 featuring the refractive index tensor @xmath202 in the presence of a magnetic field , @xmath12 is represented by a matrix with an antisymmetric part proportional to @xmath109 , as can be seen from ( [ eq_s ] ) and ( [ eq_tf ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath195 is not a symmetric operator : the transposition operation is equivalent to flip the sign of @xmath109 , or equivalently to flip the sign of @xmath3 : @xmath203 this property is closely related to the reciprocity theorem @xcite . as a simple illustration , assume a light beam is going successively through a linear polarizer @xmath10 , the atomic cloud and a linear analyzer @xmath125 .",
    "the amplitude of the transmitted light is then proportional to @xmath204 .",
    "if we now consider the reverse situation where the light beam is traveling through the system along the opposite direction , its transmitted amplitude will now be @xmath205 .",
    "we see that @xmath206 if and only if @xmath195 is symmetric , which is not the case in the presence of the magnetic field .",
    "this is in essence the underlying principle behind optical isolators ( or optical `` diodes '' ) , which are devices realizing @xmath207 while @xmath208 .",
    "the impact of @xmath3 on the coherent propagation of light is embodied in the refractive index tensor @xmath12 ( [ eq_n ] ) . as already mentioned in [ susec_index ] , it concerns a differential dephasing and attenuation of the eigenmodes of propagation .",
    "these magneto - optical effects have been extensively studied when light propagates parallel ( faraday effect ) or perpendicular to ( cotton - mouton effect ) @xmath3 .",
    "we present below both effects in terms of our formalism , giving substance to the physical interpretation of the parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",

    "when @xmath2 , the cbs effect observed with atoms having a degenerate ground state is dominated by double scattering paths , while higher - order scattering paths contribute significantly to the diffuse background @xcite .",
    "this is shown in the first line of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "as @xmath1 increases , the contrast is restored and higher and higher scattering orders contribute significantly both to @xmath329 and @xmath328 , see second line of table [ tab1 ] .",
    "@xmath327&b=0g&0.21&0.08&0.04&0.02 + & b=30g&0.81&0.75&0.69&0.38 +    however , at the same time , the optical thickness of the atomic cloud decreases .",
    "higher - order scattering paths become less and less probable and the two effects compete . the dotted line in figure [ fig_lso ]",
    "shows the enhancement factor calculated from the single and double scattering contributions alone .",
    "this approximation overestimates the height of the backscattering cone at small magnetic fields , but underestimates it at large magnetic fields .",
    "this shows that high scattering orders do contribute to the cbs cone and can not be discarded for a quantitative comparison .",
    "influence of higher and higher scattering orders on the cbs enhancement factor .",
    "the incoming light and atomic cloud parameters are given in fig.[fig_alpha ] .",
    "we compare the theoretical enhancement factor borrowed from fig.[fig_alpha ] ) with the one obtained by only considering single and double scattering orders . at small @xmath1 ,",
    "high scattering orders contribute mostly to the diffuse signal . at large @xmath1",
    ", they contribute equally to the coherent and diffuse signals , making the cbs cone height increase.,width=264 ]      in section [ susec_po ] , we mentioned that our theory does not take optical pumping into account ( though it could be extended to do so ) . in the present section ,",
    "we give conclusive evidence that optical pumping is indeed negligible in our experiment by measuring the coherent transmission of the atomic cloud .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig_trans ] , for an incoming wavevector perpendicular to @xmath3 and a circular incoming polarization .",
    "if @xmath84 , the coherent transmission varies in time and its stationary value is shown in fig.[fig_trans ] as a function of @xmath1 ( crosses ) .",
    "our monte carlo simulation ( dotted line ) is unable to reproduce these results for @xmath340 g , indicating that optical pumping is indeed present in our sample when @xmath84 .",
    "however , when the incident light beam is kept at resonance with the atomic transition @xmath310 ( i.e. @xmath326 ) , no time evolution of the coherent transmission is observed .",
    "this shows that the populations of the various zeeman substates are almost constant .",
    "the experimental data ( circles ) are well reproduced by the monte - carlo simulation ( solid line ) .",
    "this is a strong indication that optical pumping is indeed negligible when the incoming light is continuously kept at resonance with the closed atomic transition .",
    "coherent transmission of the atomic cloud as a function of @xmath1 for an initial optical thickness @xmath318 measured at @xmath2 and @xmath84 .",
    "crosses : experiment for @xmath84 . dashed line : theory for @xmath84 .",
    "solid circles : experiment for @xmath326 .",
    "solid line : theory for @xmath326 . when @xmath326 the incoming light is kept on resonance with the closed atomic transition @xmath310 .",
    "when @xmath84 , the coherent transmission increases in time and converges to the plotted value . in this case , optical pumping is at work , a situation not accounted for by our theory . for @xmath326 , no time variation of the coherent transmission is observed .",
    "this is a strong indication that optical pumping is negligible in this case.,width=264 ]      the notion of phase coherence length @xmath341 is a very important concept in mesoscopic physics .",
    "it is the length scale at which , because of some dephasing mechanisms , the interference effects as produced by the medium are effective .",
    "the larger is @xmath341 , the stronger is the impact of interference , and , in the case of the cbs effect , the larger is the cbs contrast . in the case of cold atoms , at @xmath2 ,",
    "the degeneracy of the atomic ground state causes a loss of phase coherence between reversed scattering paths giving rise to a finite value of @xmath341 of the order of few mean free paths @xmath137 @xcite .",
    "the increase of the cbs contrast when a magnetic field is applied is accordingly accompanied by a growth of @xmath341 .",
    "the monte - carlo simulation allows us to estimate the phase coherence length in the following way . in the presence of dephasing , the interference term @xmath329 associated to two reversed scattering paths of length @xmath212",
    "is related to the diffuse term @xmath328 by : @xmath342 where @xmath343 , @xmath255 being the scattering order , and @xmath344 . in fig.[fig_lcoh ]",
    "we plot @xmath345 as a function of @xmath1 as obtained numerically .",
    "it increases roughly linearly .",
    "plot of @xmath346 as a function of @xmath1 , as extracted from our monte - carlo calculation .",
    "the incoming light and atomic cloud parameters are given in fig.[fig_alpha ] .",
    "the points dispersion reflects the numerical accuracy .",
    "as one can see , @xmath345 _ _ i__ncreases with @xmath1 , roughly linearly ( the solid line is drawn to guide the eye ) .",
    "this is due to the lifting of the zeeman degeneracy which make atoms behave like effective two - level atoms when the light is tuned on resonance with a closed transition .",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast with classical scatterers where @xmath345 decreases when @xmath1 increases.,width=264 ]    one should note that our definition of the coherence length differs from the usual one where the distance travelled diffusively by the light inside the disordered sample is introduced @xcite . with this convention , @xmath347 and @xmath348 .",
    "the surprising fact that a magnetic field can restore weak localization effects under well chosen circumstances although it breaks time - reversal invariance is already known in solid - state physics @xcite . in this context ,",
    "one considers the propagation of electrons inside a metal at low ( but finite ) temperature , containing paramagnetic impurities .",
    "thermal fluctuations make the spin of these impurities fluctuate in time .",
    "the scattering of an electron by such a fluctuating impurity randomizes the electron spin and the weak localization correction to electronic transport are reduced .",
    "this is similar to the loss of contrast due to the degeneracy of the atomic ground state .",
    "when a large enough magnetic field is applied to the metal , the spins of the impurities are all aligned along @xmath3 .",
    "the fluctuations of the spin component of the electrons are suppressed and the weak localization corrections to transport are restored .    finally , in both cases , the magnetic field freezes the internal degrees of freedom and restores interference effect .",
    "the main difference with our case is that in solid - state physics , the magnetic field populates a unique spin state , whereas the zeeman substates of the atoms are equally populated . it could be possible to realize an atomic cloud almost containing only atoms in the ground state @xmath309 , by using optical pumping",
    "however , this would only restore the interference between reverse double scattering paths @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it would be possible to first populate the @xmath309 state , and then to apply an external magnetic field .",
    "this would increase the number of atoms participating to the scattering of light .",
    "multiple scattering would then play a more important role and the enhancement factor would be larger than reported in the present article .",
    "to summarize , we have accurately described in this paper the propagation of light in cold atomic gases in the multiple scattering regime where @xmath144 and in the presence of an applied external magnetic field . in this regime ,",
    "a semi - classical description is well suited and transport is described through a series of individual scattering events separated by coherent propagation in an effective medium .",
    "we have studied the impact of the magnetic field on the scattering of light by atoms with a degenerate ground state ( differential and total cross sections ) and the magneto - optical effects ( faraday and cotton - mouton effects ) embodied in the refractive index tensor of the effective medium .",
    "our results generalize previous works @xcite .",
    "we have then applied our theory to the study of the coherent backscattering effect and we have shown that the magnetic field can lead to a full restoration of the two - wave interference contrast provided the incoming light is continuously set on resonance with a closed atomic transition as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "the reason for the restoration of contrast is that the atoms behave as effective two - level atoms for which scattering amplitudes associated to reverse scattering paths have the same strength .",
