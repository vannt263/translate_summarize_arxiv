    "the spectral methods @xcite approximate the exact solution of partial differential equations by seeking an  good \" projection in the linear subspace spanned by various orthogonal systems of special functions .",
    "the resulting spectral accuracy is highly preferred than any other numerical method , especially when the solution is known to be globally smooth enough .",
    "therefore , they are very appropriate for the elliptic and parabolic equations , thanks to the regularization properties of the operators . when mentioning the nonlinear conservation laws , it is well known that the solution may develop spontaneous jump discontinuity , i.e. , shock waves .",
    "this irregularity of the solution destroys not only the accuracy of the spectral approximations at the point of discontinuity , but also that in the entire computational domain .",
    "it causes the oscillations throughout the domain , which is the so - called gibb s phenomenon .",
    "moreover , the instability is induced in the nonlinear case .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the usual spectral approximate solution may not converge to the entropy solution , the physically relevant one .    despite all these deficiencies ,",
    "many mathematicians still pay their effort to deal with these problems .",
    "the problems caused by the irregularity has already been solved for piecewise smooth functions in bounded domain or periodic piecewise smooth function in unbounded domain by filter techniques or reconstruction methods such as the gegenbauer partial sum , see details in a series of papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . and the instability of the usual spectral approximations can be avoided by introducing the vanishing viscosity , which was first established by e. tadmor @xcite .",
    "the main idea of the spectral viscosity method is the use of artificial diffusion to stabilize the spectral computation without sacrificing its spectral accuracy .",

    "the hermite and laguerre spectral methods are the most commonly used approaches based on orthogonal polynomials in infinite interval , referring to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "although the hermite polynomials appear to be a natural choice of orthogonal basis of @xmath0 , it is not as popular as fourier series and chebyshev polynomials , due to its poor resolution ( see @xcite ) and the lack of the analogue of fast fourier transformation ( fft ) , see @xcite .",
    "however , it is shown in @xcite that the poor resolution can be remedied by a suitable choice of scaling factor",
    ". some further investigations on the scaling factor can be found in @xcite and also in chapter 7 , @xcite .",

    "the literatures on the spectral method in unbounded domains have already been not as rich as those in bounded domains , let alone the spectral viscosity method in unbounded domains .",
    "as far as we know , j. aguirre and j. rivas @xcite is the only paper that considered the spectral viscosity method based on the hermite functions .",
    "however , they defined the hermite functions in the weighted @xmath1 , where @xmath2 . and no scaling factor is introduced .",
    "this essentially causes their involved theoretical proof of the convergence rate of their proposed scheme . and",
    "it is more costly when they try to implement their scheme numerically .    in this paper",
    ", we shall revisit the nonlinear scalar conservation laws in @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a smooth nonlinear function and @xmath6 .",
    "in general , the spontaneous jump discontinuity may be developed .",

    "a time - dependent scaling factor should improve the resolution further .",
    "the study on the time - dependent scaling factor of the hermite spectral method in solving evolution equations has been recently investigated in @xcite . here , we focus ourselves on the intrinsical problem by using constant scaling factor .    in both spectral schemes ,",
