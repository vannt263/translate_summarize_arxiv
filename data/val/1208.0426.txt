    "first , we discuss the linear transverse decoherence due to chromaticity , i.e.  the only source of the tune shift is the linear dependence of the betatron tune shift on the momentum shift @xmath59 . as a result of an initial transverse displacement @xmath60 , a bunch oscillates in the corresponding plane ( here @xmath61 ) .",
    "as we consider the linear case , all the particles have the identical synchrotron frequency @xmath62 . the betatron phase shift related to the bare tune",
    "@xmath2 has a harmonic dependency along a synchrotron period .",
    "hence , after one synchrotron oscillation , the betatron phase shift is exactly compensated and the transverse amplitude is equal to the initial displacement @xmath63 . assuming the gaussian momentum distribution , the amplitude of the bunch offset evolves with the turn number @xmath64 as @xcite @xmath65 here @xmath66 is the normalized rms momentum spread .",
    "figure[fg08 ] shows an example for bunch decoherence after a rigid kick .",
    "it demonstrates that a higher chromaticity provides a faster decoherence , and that after the synchrotron period @xmath67 the initial offset amplitude appears again , which is called recoherence .     a particle tracking simulation for a gaussian bunch after an offset kick @xmath68 without space charge and for a linear rf bucket , @xmath69 .",
    "the full lines show the time evolution of the bunch offset for the chromaticities @xmath70 ( blue ) and @xmath71 ( red ) , the dashed lines are analytical results and are given by eq.([eq04 ] ) . ]",
    "transverse space charge causes a betatron frequency shift , which depends on the particle transverse amplitude and on the longitudinal particle position in the bunch .",
    "the decoherence behaviour is thus very different from the linear decoherence at low bunch intensities eq.([eq04 ] ) .",

    "we observe the periodic recoherence with the periodicity 770 turns ( @xmath74 , top ) , 1270 turns ( @xmath75 , middle ) and 1640 turns ( @xmath76 , bottom ) , while the low - intensity recoherence would have a periodicity of 100 turns for the same parameters .",

    "the key in understanding of the decoherence for a bunch with transverse space charge is the representation of the initial kick as a superposition of the bunch head - tail eigenmodes , @xmath83 where we have extracted the chromatic phase shift along the bunch with the corresponding phase @xmath84 for each eigenfunction .",
    "the second key is the fact that the different eigenmodes are prone to landau damping mechanisms , but with different intensity thresholds and damping rates .",
    "landau damping due to the space charge tune spread along the bunch @xcite is the most important mechanism in the beam parameter regime considered in the simulations of this work . in the presence of space charge especially the negative and the high-@xmath85 eigenmodes present in the initial kick eq.([eq08 ] )",
    "are quickly suppressed , so that after a transition period a mixture of the survived eigenmodes continues to oscillate .    in ref.@xcite",
    "we have discussed in detail the case @xmath86 , where all the head - tail modes @xmath87 are strongly suppressed by landau damping such that the mode @xmath8 is left alone . for stronger space charge , as in fig.[fg06 ] , the modes @xmath88 are damped and the resulting oscillation is the mixture of the @xmath8 and @xmath46 modes .",
    "the recoherence periodicity seen in fig.[fg06 ] corresponds exactly to the frequency difference between these two modes , as it is the case for the wave beating . in a real machine",
    "there are often nonlinear damping mechanisms which would further suppress the @xmath8 and @xmath46 modes , but in the simulation we only have the space charge induced landau damping which is zero for the @xmath8 mode and is very weak for the @xmath46 mode at these @xmath89 parameters .",
    "it is obvious , and can be seen in eq.([eq08 ] ) , that the composition of the eigenmodes after a rigid kick depends on the chromaticity .",
    "this is also demonstrated in fig.[fg07 ] which shows a comparison of the bunch decoherence for three different chromaticities .",
    "the bunch parameters correspond to fig.[fg06 ] , the space charge parameter is chosen as @xmath74 .",
    "we see that the periodicity of 770 turns does not change .",
    "it corresponds to the frequency difference @xmath90 .",
    "the reason for the different oscillation amplitudes in fig.[fg06 ] is the increasing contribution of higher - order modes @xmath91 with growing @xmath4 in the eigenmode mixture of the initial rigid bunch offset ( see eq.[eq08 ] ) . recall that these modes are quickly suppressed for the parameters of the bunch and the resulting recoherence is a beating of the remaining @xmath8 and @xmath46 modes .",

    "the negative modes have the same coefficients but can be disregarded in the case of a bunch with space charge @xcite , because of their large damping rates .",

    "more remarkable , the bunch decoherence in fig.[fg28 ] shows a much weaker amplitude drop between the recoherence peaks .",
    "the reason is the compensated vertical chromaticity to nearly zero , according to the set parameters .",
    "this is predicted by the linear theory eq.([eq04 ] ) , also shown in fig.[fg08 ] . according to the interpretation of the mode mixture , at a small chromaticity",
    "the part of the @xmath8 mode is very large , see fig.[fg09 ] .",
    "the spectrum from the measurements in fig.[fg29 ] confirms this .",
    "the relatively small part of the @xmath47 mode provides the periodicity of a weak recoherence . for the determination of the space - charge parameter ,",
    "the eigenfrequency of the @xmath46 mode is needed which could be obtained by a frequency analysis of the bunch head oscillations , see the blue line in fig.[fg29 ] , and the resulting @xmath89values in fig.[fg30 ] ( cyan triangles ) .",
    "time evolution of the bunch offset in the vertical plane at sis18 after a transverse kick .",
    "the vertical chromaticity was compensated for this beam to @xmath138 .",
    "the recoherence periodicity corresponds to the mix of the dominating head - tail modes @xmath8 and @xmath47 with @xmath139 , giving the periodicity of 540turns . ]     transverse coherent spectrum for the bunch from fig.[fg28 ] , @xmath109 .",
    "the red spectrum is obtained from a frequency analysis of the complete bunch offset , while the blue spectrum is a result of a frequency analysis for the bunch head .",
    "the mode @xmath8 highly dominates , in the complete - bunch spectrum the mode @xmath47 is stronger , and the bunch head spectrum reveals the uneven modes @xmath46 , @xmath117 .",
    "the frequencies of the head - tail modes provide the space charge parameter @xmath137 , see cyan triangles in fig.[fg30 ] . ]",
    "the transverse decoherence and coherent eigenspectra in long bunches with space charge have been studied using measurements at the sis18 heavy - ion synchrotron and particle tracking simulations .    a model eq.([eq05 ] ) for the combined effect of space charge and nonlinear synchrotron oscillations has been formulated , with the fitting parameter @xmath52 obtained from the particle tracking simulations for the low - order head - tail modes .",
    "the space - charge parameter @xmath140 of the bunch can be determined for every head - tail mode from the corresponding frequency shift @xmath114 , see eq.([eq06 ] ) , according to the given bunch length .",
    "the transverse decoherence in bunches with space charge has been observed experimentally and quantitively explained , using simulations and analytic models .",
    "an initial rigid bunch offset can be decomposed into head - tail modes .",
    "the chromaticity determines the contribution of the different head - tail modes .",
    "using the airbag @xcite eigenmodes as an approximation for the bunch head - tail modes , the relative amplitudes can be found analytically , see fig.[fg07 ] .",
    "different head - tail modes experience also different landau damping rates . after a transition period",
    "the bunch oscillation is a combination of the remaining modes .",
    "for example , it can be a mix of the @xmath8 mode and @xmath46 mode .",
    "the periodicity of the bunch recoherence corresponds then to the frequency difference between these two modes .",
    "our simulation examples demonstrate this explanation of the bunch decoherence for different space - charge parameters and for different chromaticities , see figs.[fg06],[fg07 ] . in the simulations the dominating landau damping mechanism is due to the variation of the space charge tune shift along the bunch",
    "@xcite .    experimental observations of the transverse bunch decoherence with space charge in the sis18 heavy - ion synchrotron at gsi are presented .",
    "the space charge parameter @xmath89 has been determined from the bunch spectra for different head - tail modes , summarized in fig.[fg30 ] .",
    "with increasing bunch length we observe that nonlinear synchrotron oscillations modify the head - tail mode frequencies .",
    "the bunch decoherence always corresponded to the mix of the dominating modes , in our case the @xmath8 and @xmath46 modes or the @xmath8 and @xmath47 modes .",
    "compared to the simulation it is more difficult to predict which modes would be faster suppressed due to additional damping mechanisms in a real machine . in the experiment the oscillations are further damped after the transition period , possibly due to the nonlinear magnet field errors .",
    "the periodicity of the recoherence was exactly confirmed by the mode frequencies from the spectra .",
    "a direct comparison of the first two examples ( figs.[fg21],[fg22 ] vs.  figs.[fg23],[fg24 ] ) demonstrates the role of the bunch length .",
    "a comparison of the the fourth example ( figs.[fg28],[fg29 ] ) with the others demonstrates the role of the chromaticity : at a nearly zero chromaticity the mode @xmath8 dominates the bunch decoherence alone .",
    "the third example ( figs.[fg25],[fg26 ] ) shows a decoherence with pronounced flat between the recoherence peaks , corresponding to the mix of the @xmath8 and @xmath46 modes .",
    "the results of this work apply to the evolution of a possible transverse injection offset during bunch - to - bucket transfer from one ring to another .",
    "transverse coherent spectra can be used not only to measure the betatron tune , the head - tail mode frequencies can be used to extract useful information about the long intense bunches .",
    "the understanding of the decoherence with space charge and rf nonlinearity has direct consequences for the chromaticity measurements in intense bunches , which should be analysed in detail in a future work .",
