    "the einstein - maxwell equations describe charged gravitating matter which are important in relativistic astrophysics , and they model compact objects such as neutron stars , gravastars , dark energy stars and quark stars . in the study of such astrophysical compact objects ,",
    "the einstein - maxwell field equations in static spherical spacetimes provide the basis of investigation , and have therefore attracted the attention of many researchers . with the help of these equations , researchers have discovered different structures and properties of relativistic stellar bodies relevant in astrophysical studies .",
    "for example , the solutions to the field equations in static spacetimes obtained by @xcite describe realistic compact anisotropic spheres whose properties are relevant to stellar bodies such as saxj1808.4 - 3658 .",
    "these solutions contain masses and central densities that correspond to realistic stellar bodies .",
    "recently the models for charged matter generated by @xcite describe ultra compact astrophysical objects .",
    "the solutions obtained by @xcite describe charged compact objects and are compatible with well known stars .",
    "this indicates that the einstein - maxwell field equations have many applications in the study of relativistic astrophysical objects .",
    "pressure anisotropy is an important ingredient in many stellar systems in the absence of charge .",
    "since the pioneering paper by @xcite , who were the first to consider pressure anisotropy in the study of anisotropic spheres in general relativity , there has been extensive research in this direction .",
    "it was established by @xcite that pressure anisotropy has a significant effect on the structure and properties of stellar spheres .",
    "in particular it was shown that both the maximum mass and the redshift vary with the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy . for a positive measure of anisotropy ,",
    "the stability of the sphere is enhanced when compared to isotropic configurations , and anisotropic distributions are stable for smaller adiabatic index values as shown by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other uncharged anisotropic models with spherical symmetry include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note the paper of @xcite which showed that anisotropic models with heat flow can absorb the addition of charge , viscosity and convert null fluids to a perfect fluid .",
    "it is important for many applications to include the electric field in stellar models . in particular , models with electric field permit causal signals over a wide range of parameters as illustrated by @xcite . it has been shown by @xcite that the presence of the electric field significantly affects the redshift , luminosity and mass of the compact object .",
    "most of the models that include an electromagnetic field distribution are isotropic ; these include the new classes of solutions obtained by @xcite , @xcite , thirukkanesh and maharaj ( 2006 , 2009 ) and @xcite .",
    "other stellar models that describe charged bodies with isotropic pressures are given by chattopadhyay et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , gupta and maurya ( 2011a , b ) and @xcite .",
    "there are fewer research papers that include both anisotropic pressures and electromagnetic field distributions .",
    "the presence of pressure anisotropy with an electric field enhances the stability of a configuration under radial adiabatic perturbations compared to the matter with isotropic pressures .",
    "stellar models containing both pressure anisotropy and electric field include compact objects admitting a one - parameter group of conformal motions of @xcite , the generalized isothermal models of @xcite , the stellar models of @xcite , and the regular compact models of @xcite .",
    "other charged anisotropic models are those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however most of these models have the anisotropy parameter always present , and they do not contain isotropic solutions as a special case .",
    "it is important to build physical stellar models in which the anisotropy vanishes for an equilibrium configuration .",
    "different forms of the barotropic equation of state have been applied together with the field equations to find exact models that govern relativistic compactgravitating objects such as dark energy and quark strange stars ( hybrid stars ) . @xcite have found exact solutions for the uncharged anisotropic sphere with the polytropic equation of state for particular choices of the polytropic index .",
    "@xcite used the same general polytropic equation of state , and obtained exact solutions for field equations in the presence of the electromagnetic field and anisotropic pressures .",
    "@xcite studied the stability of rotating bodies and @xcite indicated that large amounts of gravitational energy are released in the gravitational collapse of polytropes .",
    "other treatments on polytropes include the results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and feroze and siddiqui ( 2011 ) found exact solutions of the einstein - maxwell field equations for charged anisotropic stars using a quadratic equation of state .",
    "there have been many anisotropic and charged exact models with a linear equation of state : @xcite generated compact exact models with regular distributions , @xcite found models consistent with dark energy stars and quark stars , @xcite generated anisotropic isothermal models , @xcite found models consistent with quark matter , and @xcite generated conformally invariant spheres .",
    "however , in general , most of these models do not regain charged isotropic models . some analytical solutions to the field equations with a linear quark equation of state for charged isotropic stars were found by @xcite . using the same equation of state , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , and @xcite analysed quark stars with isotropic pressures .",
    "there has been an extension of the linear quark equation to include anisotropic pressures in modeling the behaviour of strange stars by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the microscopic effects of the strange quark matter coming from strong interactions of qcd ( e.g. , see @xcite and @xcite ) are all encrypted in the final form in the equation of state of matter .",
    "we study the general relativistic behaviour of these equations of states , by employing a linear approximation for these strange matter equation of states",
    ". such approximations of the equation of states can be found in the literature in the study of various properties of compact stars .",
    "the linear approximation of the strange quark matter equation of state has been used by @xcite to study the quasi periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequencies in the lower mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "@xcite used the linear approximation of strange matter to compute the mass shedding limit of strange stars .",
    "recently a class of exact isotropic solutions of einstein s equations for non - rotating relativistic stars has also been studied by @xcite .",
    "they also comment that as strange stars are not purely gravitationally bound ; they are bound by strong interactions .",
    "study of the same in the light of modified gravity theories should not produce any difference in the mass - radius relation . in this context , although @xcite showed that there is an increase in the mass of neutron stars in the @xmath0 gravity model , @xcite showed that for the @xmath1 model ( and subsequently many other @xmath2 models where the uniqueness theorem is valid ) the existence of compact compact astrophysical is highly unnatural .",
    "this is because the equation of state of a compact star should be completely determined by the physics of nuclear matter at high density , and not only by the theory of gravity .",
    "the objective of this paper is to perform a detailed physical analysis of the particular exact solutions to the einstein - maxwell system of equations with a linear quark equation of state for charged anisotropic stars obtained by @xcite . in performing such a physical analysis we seek to regain models with masses and radii obtained by other researchers , and",
    "show that other masses contained in our model are in acceptable ranges .",
    "we also seek to compare masses and radii by considering anisotropic and isotropic pressures .",
    "this analysis shows that the relevant class of exact solutions with a quark equation of state has astrophysical significance .",
    "we model the stellar interior with quark matter in general relativity .",
    "the spacetime geometry is spherically symmetric and given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the gravitational potentials .",
    "the reissner - nordstrom line element @xmath6 describes the exterior spacetime .",
    "the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath8 define the total mass and charge of the star , respectively .",
    "the energy momentum tensor is defined by @xmath9 in the presence of charge and anisotropy . the energy density ( @xmath10 ) ,",
    "the radial pressure ( @xmath11 ) , the tangential pressure ( @xmath12 ) , and the electric field intensity ( @xmath13 ) are measured relative to a comoving fluid four - velocity @xmath14 .    the einstein - maxwell field equations are given by    [ emf ] @xmath15    where primes denote differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 represents the proper charge density .",
    "the equation of state is linear and of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a constant related to the surface density of the stellar body representing a sharp surface .",
    "if we consider the mit bag model for quark stars , then @xmath19 can also be identified with the bag constant .",
    "we introduce a new independent variable @xmath20 and define the metric functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are arbitrary constants following @xcite . with this transformation",
    "the line element in ( [ line - element ] ) becomes @xmath26 the einstein - maxwell field equations become    [ nnewemf ] @xmath27    where dots represent derivatives with respect to the variable @xmath20 .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 is called the measure of anisotropy .",
    "we introduce the mass function given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the energy density when the electric field @xmath31 .",
    "some solutions to the system ( [ nnewemf ] ) , applicable to quark matter , were presented in @xcite . in that model",
    "it was assumed that : @xmath32 for particular choices of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 it is possible to integrate the einstein - maxwell system exactly .",
    "the choice of anisotropy ensures isotropic pressures can be regained . to ensure that the anisotropy vanishes at the stellar centre we should set @xmath35 .",
    "here we consider a particular solution of @xcite that enables us to perform a detailed physical analysis .",
    "the particular solution that we can utilize can be written in terms of analytical functions , and this is presented in the appendix .",
    "note that this generalized class of models with a quark equation of state contains the nonsingular solutions of @xcite with isotropic pressures .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table4 ]    in table [ table4 ] , we see that the variation of the parameter @xmath36 does not affect the radius of the star .",
    "however , there is a decrease in the mass of the star with the increase of @xmath37 .",
    "this decrease in the mass however still falls in the allowed range of the masses and radii for quark stars .",
    "one noticeable feature of our results is that with the increase of the anisotropic parameters @xmath38 and @xmath36 , there is decrease in the mass of the star , whereas the radius remain constant .",
    "this essentially means that the effective density of the star decreases with the increase of the anisotropic parameters , and hence the effective equation of state become stiffer .    .",
    "here we see that there is an increase in the values for the isotropic case as compared to the anisotropic ones , width=302 ]    .",
    "clearly , for these choices of parameter sets , there is not much difference between the anisotropic and the isotropic cases , width=302 ]    , width=302 ]    , width=302 ]    , width=302 ]    , width=302 ]    in fig . [ figa1 ] and fig .",
    "[ figa3 ] we learn that the mass of the star decreases linearly with an increase of the anisotropic parameters @xmath39 and @xmath37 in the identified range of the constants .",
    "in order to compare the variation of the mass throughout the interior of anisotropic and isotropic stars , we have plotted in fig . [ nine]-[fourteen ] the mass against radial distance using the parameter values in table [ tableone ] . in general",
    ", we see that the masses for the isotropic cases are larger than their anisotropic counterparts , except for the parameter sets r2 and r6 , where the two graphs appear to overlap .",
    "we have studied the exact class of models with a quark equation of state found by @xcite . a detailed analysis of the physical features of this class was performed . in the uncharged case we regained the masses of @xcite and @xcite . for the charged case we regained the models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . for the anisotropic case",
    "we have also generated masses ranging from @xmath40 to @xmath41 with radius of the range @xmath42 km to @xmath43 km .",
    "for the isotropic case the masses generated are from @xmath44 to @xmath45 with radius varying from @xmath46 km to @xmath43 km .",
    "these particular models are good candidates for the astrophysical object saxj1808.4 - 3658 . as the form of the measure of anisotropy depends on the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 it is possible to generate a wide variety of other compact objects for a suitable choice of parameters .",
    "a detailed study of the mass - radius relation for different anisotropy parameter values highlights the effect of the anisotropy on the mass of the star .",
