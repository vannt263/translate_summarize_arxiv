    "in the past few years , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure data have largely confirmed the predictions of the inflationary paradigm .",
    "now , observational cosmologists have begun to turn their instruments towards the final unconfirmed signature of inflation : primordial b - mode , or odd - parity , polarization in the cmb @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , string theorists have worked diligently towards realizing observationally viable models of inflation within reasonably well - understood string compactifications ( see , e.g. , @xcite for reviews ) . in",
    "parallel , viable models of hybrid inflation continue to be explored in the context of particle physics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "brane and hybrid inflation models often predict the production of cosmic strings @xcite , linear defects arising from the breaking of u(1 ) symmetries towards the end of the inflationary epoch . these relics of the inflationary period provide a rich phenomenology , but here we focus on their contribution to the polarization of the cmb .",
    "the production of cosmic strings in such models seems at first unimportant , since they can not source the majority of the cmb anisotropy @xcite .",
    "however , it now appears that strings may be the most prominent source of observable b - mode polarization in many of these braneworld or hybrid inflationary models @xcite .",
    "strings , as extended objects , source vector mode perturbations in the cmb as readily as they do scalar mode perturbations .",
    "this is in contrast with the inflationary picture , where gravity waves generated by inflation source tensor mode perturbations that are generally much smaller than the adiabatic scalar mode perturbations .",
    "defect - sourced b - mode polarization was first calculated in @xcite for global defects , and for local strings in @xcite .",
    "recently , b - mode predictions from field theoretical simulations of local strings were also reported in @xcite .",
    "it is true that cosmic strings are subdominant sources of cmb perturbation , limited to producing less than about 10% of the primordial anisotropy @xcite ) or , more generally , has @xmath2 .",
    "the degree of preference is somewhat dependent on the shape of the spectrum .",
    "string models that predict a pronounced peak at @xmath3 in the string contribution to the cmb spectrum are less likely to improve the fit to the data than those with no peak ] .",
    "but since the inflationary tensor - to - scalar ratio - the parameter that governs the strength of inflationary gravity waves  is expected also to be below 10% , cosmic strings and primordial gravity waves may well be observables of similar detectability",
    ".    models of hybrid and brane inflation @xcite , tend to produce a low tensor - to - scalar ratio @xcite .",
    "hybrid inflationary models from particle physics , for instance , typically have unobservably small ( @xmath4 ) tensor to scalar ratios @xcite .",
    "most models of inflation that have been realized in string theory are of the hybrid type , and also have small scalar - to - tensor ratios , typically @xmath5 ( e.g. @xcite ) . on the other hand , many of these models produce cosmic strings near the gut scale @xcite , which implies a cosmic string tension ( @xmath6 ) close to the observational upper bound of @xmath7 @xcite .    among models of inflation motivated by string theory , brane inflation ( reviewed recently in refs .",
    "@xcite ) can create the widest range of cosmic sting tensions , with @xmath8 possible . in certain warped throat `` slow - roll '' scenarios , for instance ,",
    "@xmath9 is expected , while in other `` fast - roll '' realizations @xmath10 can easily be achieved @xcite . in the low - multipole region ( @xmath11 ) , experimental sensitivity to primordial gravity waves can be converted to sensitivity to strings via , and was calculated by comparing the total bb power in strings versus the total bb power from tensor modes in this @xmath12 range .",
    "this particular relation is dependent on the parameters of the string model , and a more complete conversion is suggested in  [ ddetection ] . ]",
    "@xmath13 ; hence , the promise that near - term experiments can observe @xmath14 in this multipole range implies sensitivity to strings with tensions as low as @xmath15 .",
    "brane inflation , however , may not be able to create a tensor - to - scalar ratio above @xmath16 @xcite . for high @xmath17",
    ", the situation is different : the dominant b - modes are expected to come from the lensing of primordial - e modes into b - modes by large scale structure .",
    "however , the string sourced b - mode spectrum peaks in this high @xmath12 range , so if strings are present they will show up as an excess over the expected signal .",
    "an apparent excess of 10% , for instance , would be caused by strings with a tension of @xmath18 ( assuming standard string network parameters ) .",
    "to summarize : in models of inflation that are motivated either by string theory or particle physics , the more promising avenue for creation of b - mode polarization is via cosmic strings , not tensor modes .",
    "hence , we might hope that if b - modes from inflationary tensor modes are not observed , b - modes from cosmic strings produced after inflation might be .",
    "inflationary models with large tensor modes ( like chaotic inflation ) tend not to create defects .",
    "distinguishing the source of the polarization will be a challenge .",
    "to distinguish string b - modes from primordial gravity waves requires fine scale resolution in the range @xmath19 .",
    "distinguishing string sourced polarization at @xmath17 requires an accurate calculation of the amplitude of the b - mode polarization that comes from the conversion of e - mode polarization to b - mode polarization by gravitational lensing .",
    "this is because the peak bb contribution from strings falls at @xmath20 , overlapping heavily with the spectrum expected from lensing of e. hence , the presence of a string - induced b - mode would induce an excess in power throughout this region of @xmath12 values above what is expected from lensing . accurately characterizing this excess will require very good predictions of the expected lensing signal .",
    "if all goes well , polarization experiments could eventually see strings with tensions as low as @xmath9 @xcite . because strings can source b - modes in the aftermath of a hybrid inflationary epoch that can not directly source b - modes , the class of inflationary models that b - mode experiments can test is broadened . detecting neither string or primordial gravity wave sourced b - modes would strongly constrain many inflationary models .",
    "these constraints would be different from , and perhaps stronger than , the constraints derived from measurement of other cosmological parameters ( e.g. , the spectral index @xmath21 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we outline the physics behind cosmic strings generation of b - mode polarization , placing a heavy emphasis on how much variability might be expected from various models of string networks .",
    "this gives us an idea of how much a successful detection of cosmic string b - modes might teach us about these networks .",
    "we also review some of the currently operating , soon to be launched , and future planned experiments to measure the cmb s b - mode polarization to give estimates for what range of string tensions they will be able to detect .",
    "the string - sourced perturbations are fundamentally different from those produced by inflation",
    ". inflation sets the initial conditions for the perturbations ( i.e. their initial spectrum ) which then evolve in time without additional disturbances being produced . in this sense",
    ", inflationary perturbations can be classified as _",
    "passive_. inhomogeneities produced by cosmic strings are _ active _  string networks are thought to persist throughout the history of the universe and actively source metric perturbations at all times .",
    "it is well known @xcite that , in the absence of a source term , vector modes decay quickly , scalar modes have a growing and a decaying solution , and tensor modes are sustained on superhorizon scales and decay after entering the horizon .",
    "for this reason , vector modes are not relevant in passive scenarios , and are rarely considered in the literature .",
    "cosmic strings , on the other hand , actively source scalar , vector , and tensor perturbations . for them , scalar and vector mode perturbations are typically of similar magnitude .",
    "the string generated tensor modes are also at a comparable level , but their observational impact is generally lower because of the oscillatory nature of gravity waves @xcite .",
    "the non - zero cmb temperature quadrupole at the time of recombination leads to linear polarization of cmb through compton scattering of photons on baryons . before recombination ,",
    "the photons and baryons form a tightly coupled fluid with the anisotropy characterized only by a monopole ( density contrast ) and a dipole ( mass flow ) components .",
    "after last scattering , photons propagate freely .",
    "hence polarization is produced during a narrow time window in the last scattering epoch , when scattering become sufficiently rare for a temperature quadrupole to develop .",
    "essentially , this window corresponds to the time between the last scattering and the next - to - last scattering .",
    "polarization can also be produced at more recent epochs during reionization .    at any point on the sky , cmb polarization",
    "can be represented by a headless vector with a magnitude @xmath22 and an orientation angle @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two of the four stokes parameters @xcite , and the one quantifying the circular polarization , @xmath26 .",
    "circular polarization is not produced at last scattering and is expected to be zero on cosmological scales in the absence of large scale magnetic fields or other exotic physics . ] .",
    "the pattern of the @xmath27-vectors on the sky can be separated into parity - even and parity - odd contributions , or the so - called @xmath28 and @xmath29 modes .",
    "while intensity gradients automatically generate @xmath28-mode patterns , the @xmath29-mode is not produced unless there are metric perturbations that can locally have a non - vanishing handedness , i.e. have a parity - odd component .",
    "local departures from zero handedness can be due to tensor modes , i.  e. gravity waves , which can be represented as linear combinations of left- and right - handed polarizations @xcite .",
    "the b - mode can arise from non - zero vector modes , or vorticity .",
    "cosmic strings induce both vector and tensor components in the metric by actively generating anisotropic stress , with the vector contribution being the most important .",
    "this implies a non - vanishing vorticity in the photon - baryon plasma at the surface of last scattering , which generates b - mode polarization in the cmb .",
    "the vector metric potential @xmath26 in fourier space , in the generalized newtonian gauge , can be defined as @xcite h_0j(k,)e^ikx =- v q^(1 )  , where @xmath30 is the linear perturbation to the metric and @xmath31 is a divergenceless harmonic eigenmode of the laplacian .",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite and @xcite for more detailed description of the formalism . at last scattering ,",
    "@xmath26 is given by @xcite , v ( _ * , k ) = - 8 g a^-2 _ * _ 0^ _ * d a^4 k^-1 ( p_f _ f^(1 ) + _ s^(1 ) )  , where @xmath32 represents the fluid and @xmath33 the seed contributions to the anisotropic stress , a subscript @xmath34 indicates the values of the conformal time @xmath35 and scale factor @xmath36 at last scattering . the vector anisotropic stress of the fluid , included here , is indirectly sourced by the strings through the metric",
    ". however , the direct coupling of the string anisotropic stress to the vector metric potential dominates over the ( indirectly sourced ) fluid contribution .",
    "finally , one can see from this expression that the vector potential will decay as @xmath37 if it is not actively seeded .",
    "it is instructive to consider the vector mode contribution from one straight cosmic string segment .",
    "without loss of generality , one can choose @xmath38 @xcite , in which case the @xmath39 and @xmath40 components of the fourier transform of the energy - momentum tensor of the string network become pure vector modes , i.e. they do not contribute to the scalar or tensor modes .",
    "the two components are statistically equivalent , and it is sufficient to work with just one of them .",
    "e.g. @xmath39 .",
    "the fourier components of the energy - momentum tensor of the string are given by @xcite t_00 & = & ( _ 0 + k _ 3",
    "v ) , + t_ij & = & t_00  , [ stringstress ] where @xmath41 is the component of the string s orientation in the direction @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the string s velocity in the direction @xmath42 , @xmath44 is the velocity , @xmath45 is the wiggliness parameter that renormalizes the string s tension based on its small scale structure , @xmath46 is the tension , and @xmath47 is the string s location in space .",
    "we chose @xmath38 . in our notation ,",
    "the anisotropic stress is related to @xmath39 via @xcite ^(1)_s(k , ) = -2 t_13(k , )  .",
    "[ define_emtv ] the key observation one can make from these equations is that the string contribution to anisotropic stress is always present , even for a stationary string .",
    "the string s orientation inherently violates isotropy .    for a single string , the strength of the scalar , vector and tensor contributions depend on the orientation of the string with respect to @xmath48 .",
    "a network of strings can be thought of as a collection of many string segments at random positions , each with a random orientation and velocity .",
    "the b - mode power spectrum is determined by the two - point correlation @xmath49 , where the sums are taken over all segments present at last scattering . if the segments are statistically independent  which is approximately true since they are taken to be comparable to the horizon size  then the ensemble average reduces to a single sum over contributions of separate strings , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , if all strings are statistically equivalent , this reduces to @xmath51 , where n is the number of segments and @xmath52 is the contribution from one string .",
    "one can analytically evaluate the average @xmath53 for a straight string using eqs .",
    "( [ stringstress ] ) and ( [ define_emtv ] ) by averaging over uniformly distributed velocity directions , string positions and orientations .",
    "the dependence of the b - mode spectrum on the network parameters can be inferred from how @xmath53 varies with @xmath44 , @xmath54 and @xmath45 .",
    "we will return to this when we interpret our numerical results , but we sketch the main dependencies now .",
    "two important network parameters  the correlation length , @xmath54 , and the strings root - mean square ( rms ) velocity , @xmath44  enter @xmath55 ( see eq .",
    "( [ stringstress ] ) ) in a sine and cosine function , respectively .",
    "scaling @xmath54 and @xmath44 up and down , then , amounts to changing the fourier space dependence of the string contribution .",
    "the dominant fourier modes will determine the dominant angular modes of the b - mode spectrum and set the location of the angular peaks .",
    "the sine function that depends on @xmath54 sets the location of the peak in string - sourced power .",
    "the cosine function that depends on @xmath44 also takes a contribution from a random phase .",
    "varying @xmath44 changes the number of cosine - peaks that contribute to the shape of the overall peak .",
    "higher velocity strings will contribute more cosine peaks and lead to broader b - mode spectra . changing the rms velocity also changes the ratio @xmath56 , i.  e. the relative contribution of the anisotropic stress versus the isotropic stress .",
    "namely , increasing @xmath44 _ reduces _ this ratio .",
    "this can be seen by computing this ratio from eq .",
    "( [ stringstress ] ) , @xmath57 + \\mathcal{o}(v^4),\\ ] ] so that any nonzero velocity always decreases the anisotropic contribution .",
    "string wiggliness similarly suppresses the anisotropic stress relative to the isotropic stress .",
    "all of these effects can be seen in  [ numerical ] and figs .",
    "[ sixspectra ] , [ xidouble ] , and [ veldouble ] , which present the results from our numerical experiments .",
    "the cosmic string model we use was introduced in @xcite , based on the approach suggested in @xcite , and developed into its present form in @xcite .",
    "the code that evaluates the cmb temperature and polarization spectra for the model is publicly available as cmbact @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the string network is represented by a collection of uncorrelated straight string segments moving with uncorrelated , random velocities .",
    "there are two fundamental length scales in such a model , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lengthscales ] : @xmath58 , the length of a string segment , which represents the typical length of roughly straight segments in a full network ; and @xmath59 , the typical length between two string segments , which sets the number density of strings in a given volume ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "the model assumes network scaling , which is expected from numerical simulations . in the simplest scaling ,",
    "the length of each segment at any time ( @xmath61 ) is taken to be equal to the correlation length of the network ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "this length and the rms velocity of segments are computed from the velocity - dependent one - scale model of martins and shellard @xcite .",
    "the positions and orientations of the segments are drawn from uniform distributions in space and on a two - sphere , respectively .",
    "the model s parameters have been calibrated to produce source correlation functions in agreement with those in ref .",
    "the _ shapes _ of the spectra obtained using the model are in good agreement with results of other groups @xcite , who used different methods .",
    "on the cosmological scales probed by the cmb measurements , the fine details of the string evolution do not play a major role .",
    "it is the large - scale properties  such as the scaling distance , the equation of state ( wiggliness ) , and the root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity  that determine the shape of the string - induced spectra .",
    "all of these effects are accounted for by , and are adjustable in , our model .",
    "furthermore , the overall normalization of the spectrum has a simple dependence on the string tension and number density : c_^strings n_s ( g)^2 ( ) ^2 .",
    "since we can understand the overall amplitude of the spectrum in this simple way , we will focus on how the shape and distribution of b - mode power spectra are altered by changing various network parameters .",
    "finally , the wiggly nature of strings is accounted for by modifying the string energy - momentum tensor using the wiggly string equation of state : [ stringeos ] u =  , t = ^-1  , where @xmath45 is a parameter describing the wiggliness , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the mass per unit length and the string tension of the wiggly string , and @xmath46 is the tension ( or , equivalently , the mass per unit length ) of the smooth string .",
    "in addition to modifying the equation of state , the presence of small - scale structure slows strings down on large scales .",
    "we account for this by dividing the rms string velocity by the parameter @xmath45 .",
    "the wiggliness of the strings remains approximately constant during the radiation and matter eras , but changes its value during the transition between the two .",
    "we take the radiation era value , @xmath65 , to be a free parameter that we vary , and set the matter era value to be @xmath66 , with a smooth interpolation between the two values ( as prescribed in @xcite ) . for nambu - goto strings ,",
    "this roughly agrees with results of numerical simulations @xcite which show a decrease from @xmath67 in the radiation era to @xmath68 in the matter era .      before proceeding to discuss specific dependencies ,",
    "let us describe the main features in the shape of the string induced b - mode spectrum .",
    "all spectra in fig .",
    "[ sixspectra ] have two peaks .",
    "the less prominent peak at lower @xmath12 is due to rescattering of photons during reionization , which corresponds to an optical depth of @xmath69 @xcite , or an approximate redshift range of @xmath70 .",
    "the main peak , at higher @xmath12 , is the contribution from last scattering .",
    "both peaks are quite broad .",
    "this is because a string network seeds fluctuations over a wide range of scales at any given time .",
    "the position of the main peak is determined by the most dominant fourier mode stimulated at last scattering .",
    "one can estimate this dominant scale using simple analytical considerations based on the uncorrelated segment picture presented in the previous section .",
    "it primarily depends on the string correlation length at last scattering , but also is affected by the rms string velocity and the wiggliness .",
    "hence , finding the location of the main string peak , which falls in the range of many b - mode experiments ( see sec . [ detection ] ) , would give us a direct measure of the physics of a cosmic string network .",
    "we discuss the key dependencies in a sequence of subsections below .",
    "for fixing the normalization , there are two possible approaches . in the first , we make use of the observational upper bound that at most @xmath71 of the overall tt power is sourced by strings .",
    "we define the total power as c^x _ = 2 ^ 2000 ( 2 + 1 ) c_^x  , where the superscript @xmath72 labels a particular type of the spectrum .",
    "the string tension , @xmath6 , controls the overall amplitude of the power spectrum , but does not affect its shape or the ratio of the bb to the tt spectrum .",
    "so we can adjust the string spectrum normalization ( i.  e. @xmath73 ) so that c^tt_strings / c^tt_total=0.1  .",
    "we can then use the adjusted value of @xmath6 to evaluate the b - mode spectrum .",
    "the results from this approach are shown in fig .",
    "[ sixspectra ] . following from this approach ,",
    "when we speak of the `` amplitude '' of bb power , this amplitude should be interpreted as amplitude of bb relative to tt power .",
    "in particular , in the lower half of fig .",
    "[ sixspectra ] we plot @xmath74 . increasing the wiggliness of the strings , for example , increases the tt power but does not affect the anisotropic stress . hence ,",
    "after we reduce @xmath6 to keep the string induced cmb anisotropy at a 10% level , the amplitude of the predicted b - mode signal will be lower for larger wiggliness .",
    "the other approach we employ is to ignore constraints on the tt spectrum and simply ask what @xmath6 will be detectable , given a certain experimental sensitivity to b - mode power .",
    "this way of looking at the problem allows us to neglect questions about what the exact upper limit of the string contribution to the tt power is and gives a more direct measure of how varying network parameters can make string - sourced bb power more or less detectable .    .",
    "note also that we have plotted the b - mode spectra from primordial gravity waves for a tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath75 ( blue , solid ) and from e to b lensing ( red , dashed ) in each panel for comparison purposes .",

    "higher low-@xmath12 power means a stronger signal in the gravity wave region .",
    "a lower peak @xmath12 makes it easier to distinguish string - sourced b - modes from the e to b lensing signal . of note",
    "here is the nearly linear dependence of low-@xmath77 power on correlation length.,width=384 ]    correlation length controls the dominant momentum mode contributed by strings to the anisotropic and ordinary stress . in our string network model , the comoving length @xmath54 is a function of time determined from the one - scale model of @xcite . scaling implies that the physical correlation length @xmath78 remains a fixed fraction of the horizon .",
    "that is , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are constants corresponding to the radiation and matter eras respectively .",
    "typically , @xmath82 , and the transition between the two scaling regimes carries well into the matter era , so the value of @xmath58 during the last scattering epoch is much closer to @xmath80 than it is to @xmath81 .    to study how the b - mode spectrum changes when the correlation length varies , we changed the function @xmath54 by constant factors .",
    "in other words , in each case we did not alter the parameters of the one - scale model  which encodes a relationship between @xmath44 and @xmath54  but simply multiplied the output length scale by a constant before feeding it into the cmb calculations . in figs .",

    "( [ stringstress ] ) , where @xmath85 is a randomized constant .",
    "hence we would expect that the dominant string contribution  the location of the main string power spectrum peak  scales monotonically with @xmath54 .",

    "namely , we did not alter the parameters of the one - scale model , but instead multiplied the output for the rms string velocity by a constant factor to obtain values of @xmath44 during the radiation epoch in the range @xmath90 .    as anticipated from analytical considerations in",
    " [ polarization ] , larger values of the rms velocity decrease the amount of b - mode power relative to tt power .",
    "however , the dependence of the shape of the spectrum on velocity is non - trivial",
    ". the peak moves to higher multipoles ( smaller scales ) for low and moderate velocities ( @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) , but moves to larger scales for higher velocities and between the low and moderate velocities .",
    "these changes reflect the nonlinear dependence on velocity encoded in eq .",
    "[ stringstress ] , averaged over an entire network .",
    "the chief cause of this effect seems to come from the cosine dependence of the anisotropic stress on velocity .",
    "as velocity grows larger , more cosine maxima contribute to the power .",
    "hence the peak is not as well defined by the overall @xmath12-dependence , and becomes a somewhat broader peak , with many velocity - driven momentum modes contributing .    for detectability ,",
    "the chief result of changing the string segments rms velocity is that higher velocities generally move the peak of the spectrum to lower @xmath12 and , consequently , force proportionally more of the b - mode power into the low-@xmath88 region .",
    "we should not be surprised that the effect of higher velocity is qualitatively similar to that of larger @xmath58 .",
    "the worldsheet area swept out be a string segment is proportional to @xmath93 , and the effect strings have on their surroundings is related to this area .",
    "hence , higher velocities have a similar effect to longer correlation lengths .",
    "the amount of small - scale structure on strings , or their wiggliness , affects the b - mode spectra in two ways .",
    "one effect is that wigglier strings are slower on horizon scales , hence the trends associated with varying the rms velocity would again be relevant .",
    "the other effect is the suppression of the stress - components of the energy - momentum tensor with respect to the energy density .",
    "this follows immediately from the modified string equation of state ( [ stringeos ] ) and , equivalently , from the @xmath94 factor in ( [ stringstress ] ) .",
    "generally , wigglier strings generate less vector - mode power relative to the total power , because of the overall suppression of the anisotropic stress .",
    "the dependence of the peak location on the wiggliness comes through the effect on the rms velocity of the network . for the range of @xmath65 we have considered in this work ( @xmath95 ) , the effect on",
    "the location of the peak is relatively minor .",
    "the standard inflationary paradigm predicts two sources for b - mode polarization : primordial gravity waves and gravitational lensing of e - mode polarization into b - mode polarization by intervening structure .",
    "the physics underlying the latter of these sources is well established , and the spectrum and amplitude of this source of b - mode polarization can be predicted using knowledge of the e - mode spectrum , which is generated directly from the well understood adiabatic , scalar perturbations from inflation .",

    "the `` high '' range is @xmath100 , the range of multipoles where e to b lensing is expected to dominate ; this is also the range where the peak of string - sourced b - modes lies .    to make estimates of experimental sensitivity in the `` low '' range",
    ", we devised a simple factor for translating between gravity wave and cosmic string - sourced @xmath101 power .",
    "most experimental groups estimate what @xmath102 they will be able to reach .",
    "this estimate amounts to reporting their sensitivity to b - mode power in the `` low '' range .",
    "since strings also make b - mode power in this range , albeit with a different spectrum , we can calculate what @xmath6 would be necessary to produce the same b - mode power as gravity waves for a given tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath102 .",
    "practically , we convert from @xmath102 to @xmath6 as follows : we generated the @xmath101 spectrum using cmbfast for a particular @xmath102 .",
    "we then summed the total power in the @xmath101s between @xmath103 .",
    "we then used our own code to repeat the calculation for string - sourced @xmath101s for our fiducial @xmath6 .",
    "then , since @xmath104 for tensor modes and @xmath105 for cosmic strings generally , while @xmath106 in the low-@xmath12 region , we were able to infer a `` translation '' equation ",
    "the string tension @xmath6 necessary to create the same bb power between @xmath103 for a given scalar - to - tensor ratio , @xmath102 , given a set of network parameters . for our string model this is given approximately by @xmath107     detection scenario , in which a systematic excess of b - mode power over what is expected from e to b lensing is observed .",
    "the black solid line is the sum of the string and lens - sourced b - mode power .",
    "the dotted blue line is the string - sourced portion , while the red dashed line is the expected lensing spectrum .",
    "here we have taken @xmath108.,width=288 ]    in the `` high '' range , lensing of e - mode to b - mode polarization is expected to be the dominant source of bb power .",
    "however , this is also the range where the string - sourced b - mode spectrum peaks .",
    "hence , we were able to do a calculation in this range similar to the one described above to discover how much at what @xmath6 strings would source the same amount of b - mode power as lensing in this `` high '' range . to calculate this , we summed the power in the @xmath101s for @xmath109 .",
    "our result is that the string sourced b - modes have the same power as lensed b - modes in the `` high '' region for @xmath110 , assuming smooth strings .",
    "again , this is a different kind of comparison than the one given above , in the  low \" region . for  low \" @xmath12 ,",
    "it is quite possible that there will be no signal from gravity waves at all , and that a possible string signal will be the only source of power in this region . for  high \" @xmath12 ,",
    "though , we will certainly find the lensed e to b - mode spectrum .",
    "so the proper approach in the ",
    "high \" range is to look for a systematic excess in b - mode power over what is expected from lensing .",
    "this sort of excess is plotted in fig .",
    "[ detection ] , and was analyzed in some detail for the experiment c@xmath12over by @xcite .",
    "the fraction of tt power sourced by strings in this case would be only 3% , yet b - mode signal in the  high \" region is doubled ! for the experiments listed below ,",
    "we designate each as l if it covers the `` low '' range and h if it covers the `` high '' range .",
    "* quad @xcite ( l / h ) : this south pole based bolometric array that has completed data collection .",
    "it explores the range @xmath111 , with sensitivity enough eventually to reach @xmath112 in the  low \" range , and with a good chance of seeing e to b lensing ( and with it , a string - sourced excess ) in the  high \" range .",
    "results from its first season of operation were reported in @xcite , while the full results should be available soon @xcite .",
    "* bicep @xcite ( l ) : this experiment is presently taking its first season of data .",
    "similar to quad , it is located at the south pole and explores between @xmath113 , with enough sensitivity to reach @xmath114 by its third year ( 2009 ) .",
    "* ebex @xcite ( l / h ) : a balloon - based experiment that is expected to begin taking data in 2008 .",
    "it will observe in the range @xmath115 , with greatest sensitivity at high-@xmath12 .",
    "though its proposal is not explicit on this point @xcite , they appear to be able to observe @xmath116 at low-@xmath12 , and have enough sensitivity at higher @xmath12 that they should be able to detect e to b lensing , and hence observe a string - sourced excess in the  high \" range . if @xmath117 , ebex could definitively detect and confirm cosmic string - sourced b - mode polarization . * c@xmath12over @xcite(l / h ) : located in the atacama desert of chile , c@xmath12over should begin taking data in 2009 .",
    "it will explore between @xmath115 , and has enough sensitivity to see @xmath118 in the low-@xmath12 band .",
    "like ebex , c@xmath12over should be able to detect e to b lensing , and so could detect and confirm a cosmic string signal down to @xmath119 .",
    "* quiet @xcite ( l / h ) : also to be located in the atacama , quiet operates in two @xmath12 ranges , and expects to operate through two operational phases . in phase one , it will observe at ( 1 ) @xmath120 , reaching at least @xmath121 and ( 2 ) between @xmath122 with enough sensitivity to measure e to b lensing .",
    "in phase two , they hope to give best - of - breed measurements between @xmath123 and @xmath124 , though it is unclear what @xmath102 they hope to reach .",
    "construction for this instrument is underway .",
    "* polarbearr @xcite ( h ) : an experiment to be placed on the viper south pole telescope , concentrating on the range @xmath125 .",
    "polarbear - i , the first phase , should be able to detect @xmath126 in the low-@xmath12 range and give a very well characterized measurement of the e to b lensing signal up to @xmath127 , with at least 9 @xmath12 bins in the h range .",
    "this level of resolution in @xmath12 space could allow a cosmic string signal to be differentiated from a lensing signal for @xmath10 . a possible later upgrade , polarbear - ii ,",
    "would give a very fine - grained ( @xmath128 @xmath12-bins ) measurement of the h region .",
    "cosmic string networks can produce b - mode polarization in the cmb at observable levels if the strings source between 1 and 10% of the tt - power in the cmb .",
    "this prediction holds across a wide variety of string network parameter values , as we have discussed above .",
    "smooth ( @xmath129 ) and/or slow - moving ( @xmath130 ) strings produce the strongest b - modes , because they generate the largest ratio of anisotropic to isotropic stress sourced by cosmic strings .",
    "the first b - mode polarization experiments will bin many @xmath12 multipoles together .",
    "we calculate that a cosmic string - sourced b - mode signal could mimic the b - mode power expected from inflationary gravity waves in the range between @xmath11 .",
    "since low-@xmath12 power from strings versus inflationary gravity waves scale approximately as @xmath131 , expectations that future experiments could probe @xmath132 @xcite imply that cosmic strings with tensions as low as @xmath133 may eventually be detectable via their low-@xmath12 b - mode polarization . in the meantime , without fine resolution in @xmath12 , the only way to discriminate between these two sources would be to look at high-@xmath12 ( @xmath100 ) , where the string sourced b - mode spectrum reaches its peak . in this range , gravitational lensing of e - mode polarization into b - mode polarization",
    "is expected to dominate , so a string contribution would appear as a systematic excess of power over what is expected ( see fig .",
    "[ detection ] ) . disentangling",
    "the string - sourced and primordial gravity wave signals will require either good spectral information , via narrow @xmath12 bins , or accurate and reliable calculations of the spectrum and amplitude of e to b lensing signal .",
    "some existing methods for calibrating lensing , however , rely on the assumption that all of the b - mode polarization present for @xmath134 is sourced by lensing @xcite . in our model , strings generate the same b - mode power as is expected from the e to b lensing signal for @xmath135 ( for standard network parameters and smooth strings ) ; thus , strings with a tension in this range would lead to a doubling of the b - mode power in the  high \" region .",
    "if low-@xmath12 b - modes or an excess of power in the high-@xmath87 region are seen , we should look for cosmic strings with tensions @xmath136 in another observational probe , such as gravitational lensing @xcite or small - angle anisotropies in the cmb temperature @xcite .",
    "such an observation would also motivate a reworking of lensing reconstruction algorithms to account for the cosmic string contribution . even in the absence of such analysis ,",
    "detailed spectral information should potentially allow one to distinguish between the inflationary and stringy reionization peaks at low-@xmath12 . in practice",
    ", we expect that this will give only ambiguous results in the near term . accurately calibrating the e to b",
    "lensing spectrum and amplitude is more promising , since it allows direct access to the peak in string - generated b - mode power , which  as noted before ",
    "will be present as an apparent excess of power in this high multipole range .",
    "the discovery of a cosmic string signal in the b - mode polarization of the cmb would teach us about the string network that generated it since the shape of the string - sourced spectrum is sensitive to network parameters .",
    "it would also help us to determine the energy scale at which inflation occurred .",
    "as we have demonstrated , the expected string - sourced b - mode spectrum is robust to theoretical uncertainty in the string network model .",
    "thus , as these experiments turn on and collect polarization data , a cosmic string network will either be seen through its polarization spectrum or will be restricted to a considerably lower tension in the case of non - observation , with polarization - based limits on @xmath6 being comparable to those expected from the analysis of the data from planck @xcite .",
