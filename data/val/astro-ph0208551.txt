    "recent studies have found that the comoving integrated star formation rate ( sfr ) increases by an order of magnitude as z increases from 0 to 1 ( connolly et al .",
    "1997 ; hogg et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter h98 ; yan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "surveys at redshifts greater than z = 2 show that this trend flattens or decreases in that range , indicating that there may be a peak in the sfr within the redshift range @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is necessary to observe galaxies at these redshifts to understand star formation history not only in individual galaxies , but also in the universe as a whole .",
    "sfrs for local galaxies have been inferred by measuring the 6563 emission line ( kennicutt 1983 ) .",
    "is a good sfr indicator because it measures the flux of ionizing photons from young , massive o and b stars .",
    "assuming an initial mass function ( imf ) and case b recombination , it is then possible to calculate the total sfr .",
    "this method is observationally easiest up to z @xmath6 0.3 , beyond which is redshifted out of the optical wavelength range .",
    "other prominent optical emission lines are  and [ o iii ] 5007 , which are observable up to z = 0.7 , as well as [ o ii ] 3727 and [ ne iii ] 3869 , which are still in the optical up to a redshift of z = 1.2 .",
    "it is possible to use [ o ii ] 3727 ( a blend of [ o ii ]  3726,3729 ) as a sfr indicator , although it is not as reliable ( kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "recent studies of local galaxies ( jansen , franx , & fabricant 2001 ; carter et al .",
    "2001 ; charlot et al .",
    "2002 ) have found that the observed l([o ii])/l ( ) ratio is correlated with the galaxy luminosity .",
    "these studies have shown that the dependence is due to both reddening and the metallicity - dependent excitation of the interstellar medium .",
    "the sfrs derived from the [ o ii ] fluxes therefore have large uncertainty .",
    "in local galaxies jansen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) found this uncertainty to be a factor of @xmath6 3 , if no correction for metallicity and dust is possible .",
    "although this wide range in [ o ii]/values will lead to large uncertainty in sfrs based on [ o ii ] line flux , it is still valuable to determine an average value for calibration of [ o ii ] and sfr . using this average value",
    "will not give accurate sfrs for individual objects ; but , for a large survey , accurate sfr densities may still be attainable , making it possible to assess the sfr in the previously inaccessible redshift range of @xmath5 .",
    "mccarthy et al . ( 1999 , hereafter m99 ) used parallel grism observations with nicmos onboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) to survey blank fields for -emitting galaxies at @xmath7 .",
    "the survey , using the g141 slitless grism on nicmos , covered approximately 64 arcmin@xmath8 and found 33 emission line galaxies .",
    "redshifts were measured with the assumption that the single observed emission line was .",
    "is the most likely identification , since is the strongest optical / near - ir line ( kennicutt 1992 ) .",
    "m99 found an average sfr per galaxy of 30 m@xmath9 yr@xmath10 and an emission - line galaxy comoving number density of @xmath11 .",
    "this comoving number density is about half that of present - day galaxies brighter than l * in the _ b_-band ( ellis et al .",
    "1996 ) and similar to bright lyman break galaxies at z @xmath6 3 ( steidel et al .",
    "the calculated sfr density ( yan et al .",
    "1999 ) is consistent with results from a similar study by hopkins , connolly , & szalay ( 2000 ) .",
    "two of the 33 m99 galaxies were suggested to be active galaxies ( seyferts ) based on their high equivalent widths and compact morphologies .    to confirm the redshifts given by m99 , and thus the sfrs and comoving number density estimates",
    ", we have obtained optical spectra of 14 of the galaxies in the m99 survey . along with the redshifts of the galaxies ,",
    "the sfrs based on the [ o ii ] emission are considered in an effort to determine if [ o ii ] , instead of , can be used for future surveys .",
    "the comoving number density of seyfert 1 galaxies is also investigated .",
    "section 2 describes the observations , reduction process , and discusses how well our 14 galaxies represent the 33 galaxies in the survey done by m99 , and @xmath123 presents the emission line detections .",
    "the implications of these emission lines ( sfr , reddening , classification of the galaxies as active or starburst , and seyfert 1 luminosity function ) , as well as two new diagnostic diagrams , are given in @xmath124 .    throughout this paper , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are adopted , unless stated otherwise , to simplify comparison with previous studies .",
    "all observations were made with the keck ii telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 , cohen et al . 1994 ) .",
    "three gratings were used : the 150 line mm@xmath10 grating , which is blazed at a wavelength of 7500  ; the 300 line mm@xmath10 , which is blazed at a wavelength of 5000  ; and the 400 line mm@xmath10 , which is blazed at a wavelength of 8500  .",
    "the dispersions are 4.80   pixel@xmath10 , 2.48   pixel@xmath10 , and 1.90   pixel@xmath10 , for the 150 , 300 , and 400 line mm@xmath10 gratings respectively .",
    "a slit width of 1@xmath15 was used for all observations , which was usually comparable to the seeing full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the fwhm of sky emission lines were measured to be 20.0   for the 150 line mm@xmath10 grating , 14.4   for the 300 line mm@xmath10 grating , and 12.0a  for the 400 line",
    "mm@xmath10 grating , giving respective widths of 860 km s@xmath10 , 620 km s@xmath10 , and 510 km s@xmath10 at 7000  . at the blaze wavelength",
    "the resolution is r @xmath6 375 , 350 , 700 , for the 150 , 300 , and 400 line mm@xmath10 gratings , respectively .",
    "all observed emission lines , except where noted otherwise , were spectrally unresolved .",
    "table 1 lists the length of exposure , number of exposures , filter and grating used , grating angle , and the rest wavelengths observed for each galaxy .",
    "reduction of the spectra followed standard techniques , using the ccdred and longslit packages in the iraf software package .",
    "the reduction began with removal of cosmic rays , which was done with the cosmicrays package .",
    "bias subtraction was , in most cases , accomplished by subtraction of images nodded along the slit , which subtracts the ccd bias as well as a first order removal of sky emission lines .",
    "the images were subsequently flat fielded and bad pixels were replaced by the average value of the surrounding pixels .",
    "dark current was found to be negligible ( less than 24 electrons hour@xmath10 ) .",
    "the iraf package apall was used to extract one - dimensional spectra .",
    "sky subtraction regions were placed between 15 and 30 pixels ( 3@xmath16.2 to 6@xmath16.5 ) from the center of the galaxy spectrum .",
    "the sky emission lines are independently variable in time and it is often difficult to remove the sky emission completely despite the method used by apall and the nodded image subtraction . in some cases",
    "this can distort an emission line s profile , which is manifested as a change in line flux and/or strongly non - gaussian profile .",
    "sky subtraction is the dominant source of error in the measurements of the galaxy emission lines . for those galaxies with two exposures ,",
    "an average of the one - dimensional spectra was taken .",
    "the one - dimensional spectra were then wavelength - calibrated using an arc lamp ( neon or neon with argon ) emission spectrum .",
    "at least 20 emission lines were used to fit a chebyshev polynomial to determine the wavelength scale . for a few of the observations ,",
    "a calibration frame was not taken in a matching grating setting , and the sky emission lines in the image itself were used instead of an arc .",
    "the fits to the calibration emission lines had a standard deviation of 3.0 pixels , 2.0 pixels , and 1.4 pixels for the 150 , 300 , and 400 line mm@xmath10 gratings , respectively .",
    "this results in a redshift accurate to around 0.004 for the 150 line",
    "mm@xmath10 , 0.001 for the 300 line mm@xmath10 , and 0.0007 for the 400 line mm@xmath10 gratings .",
    "however , the redshift accuracy is decreased because of effects from flexure and , in some cases , from the significant time between acquisition of the galaxy and arc spectra .",
    "in addition , the faint lines , such as those found in the galaxy spectra , are not located as accurately as bright arc lines . as a result , the redshifts are only accurate to 0.002 for both the 300 and 400 line mm@xmath10 gratings .",
    "this accuracy is still 5 times better than that of m99 .",
    "the grating and grating angles were chosen for each object so that [ o ii ] would fall within the observed wavelength region , assuming the redshift given by m99 , as well as avoiding strong oh sky emission . however , for the july 17 run only the 300 line mm@xmath10 grating was used , which lead to spectra without the region expected to contain [ o ii ] for some galaxies . for the higher redshift objects in our sample",
    ", it was not possible to obtain a spectrum of the region expected to contain [ o ii ] with any configuration .",
    "the only exception is the spectrum obtained of j0055 + 8515a , for which the 150 line",
    "mm@xmath10 grating was available .",
    "the range of rest - frame wavelengths covered , assuming the redshift given by m99 , are listed in table 1 .    for flux calibration of the spectra we used oke ( 1990 ) spectrophotometric standards , observed and reduced via the above method . for all but five of the objects ,",
    "the spectrophotometric observations used for calibration were taken during the same run as the target observation . during the july 1998 and january 1999 runs , however , no spectrophotometric standards were observed .",
    "standards observed during the may 1999 run were used for calibrating this data . comparing the transmission curve of a spectrophotometric standard observed during the december 1999 run with",
    "one from the may 1999 run reveals a difference of less than 3% .",
    "therefore , the transmission curve does not change significantly over extended lengths of time , and using a standard observed several months earlier or later for calibration does not add much additional error to the flux .",
    "there was also no spectrophotometric standard observed in august 1998 , when j0055 + 8515a was observed using the 150 line mm@xmath10 grating .",
    "the observations from the may 1999 run , using the 400 line mm@xmath10 grating , were assumed to have a flux proportional to the flux that would be observed if the 150 line mm@xmath10 grating were used .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since the blaze wavelengths and grating angles are similar .",
    "the ratio of flat fields taken with each grating gives the constant of proportionality needed to calibrate j0055 + 8515a using a standard observed using the 400 line mm@xmath10 grating .",
    "it was found that the 400 line mm@xmath10 grating has a flux 2.67 times lower per pixel than what would be measured if using the 150 line mm@xmath10 grating at 7000  , with a slight decrease ( increase ) at higher ( lower ) wavelengths . using the may 1999 standard for the calibration of j0055 + 8515a does not add more than an additional 10% of error .",
    "the overall uncertainty in the flux calibration is typically about 8% . including the error due to the placement of the continuum in measuring line fluxes and the noise of the spectrum , this error increases to around 19% ( 37% in regions of poor sky subtraction ) .",
    "another factor in determining the total line fluxes of the entire galaxy is loss of light due to the slit used during the spectroscopic observations .",
    "a comparison of the continuum flux measured in six of the spectra and the flux measured in direct images reveals an average slit loss of 2.76@xmath00.37 times the flux .",
    "individually measured slit loss corrections were used when possible , and the average slit loss was used for those galaxies without a direct measurement .",
    "a slit loss correction has been applied to all line fluxes ( see table 3 for the slit loss correction used [ slc ] ) . for those galaxies with direct slit loss measurements ,",
    "the error introduced in the resulting line fluxes is that of the continuum _",
    "r_-band spectroscopic measurement and direct _ r_-band image measurement , typically a total of 3% .",
    "the additional error in the line fluxes of those galaxies without a direct measurement is simply the standard deviation of the average slit loss correction that was applied , which is 13% .",
    "this gives a total error in the line fluxes of 20% up to 39% , depending on the quality of the sky subtraction and the slit loss correction used .",
    "as discussed above , there is also additional error in the flux of the july 17 1998 , august 1998 , and january 1999 data due to the use of a spectrophotometric standard observed during a run other than that of the galaxy observation .",
    "the spectra have not been corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "imaging photometry was obtained in the johnson _",
    "r _ band ( @xmath17=6417  , fwhm=1185  ) and in some cases the johnson _",
    "i _ band ( @xmath17=8331  , fwhm=3131  ) . the direct ccd images were bias - subtracted and then divided by a normalized flat field .",
    "the multiple exposures of a given field were then combined .",
    "table 2 lists the details of the exposures taken for each field : date of exposure , combined exposure length , and the filter used . rather than _",
    "r_-band images , _",
    "i_-band images were taken for j0040 + 8505a and j0055 + 8518a and both _ i_- and _",
    "r_-band images were available for the j1237 + 6219 field .",
    "no image was obtained of j0622 - 0018a .",
    "photometry was measured in a circular aperture of diameter 10 pixels ( 2@xmath16.2 ) , which is about twice the fwhm of the sources .",
    "to calibrate the magnitudes , photometry of standard stars at similar airmasses were taken using the same radius aperture .",
    "all observing runs had good photometric conditions and the consistency of the standards is 2% . as a result ,",
    "the magnitude error is dominated by a combination of the photon statistics of the standard star and galaxy measurement .",
    "the _ h_-band magnitudes and _ j - h _ colors given by m99 are listed in table 3 , using the vega scale , for each of the galaxies in our study .",
    "also included are the colors measured in our study , as well as the error on these measurements .",
    "j0613 + 4752a has a higher uncertainty in its magnitude because it is less than 2@xmath16 from a star .",
    "this causes contamination of the galaxy at our resolution . to measure the magnitude of j0613 + 4752a , photometry in a circular 3 pixel radius aperture was measured for the galaxy and a corresponding region on the opposite side of the star as well .",
    "assuming the star has a symmetric light profile , the light from the star on the opposite side of the galaxy can then be subtracted from the measurement made centered on the galaxy .",
    "this yields the light contribution from just the galaxy , which is reported in table 3 .",
    "our sample of galaxies is a fair representation of the galaxies in the 33 galaxy survey discovered by m99 , with a slight bias towards the lower redshifts .",
    "figures 1 , 2 , and 3 show the distribution of apparent h magnitude , redshift ( as given by m99 ) , and luminosity , respectively , of the spectroscopic targets chosen for our sample , as well as the entire m99 sample .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test reveals that the probability that the two distributions , the full sample and our subsample , differ is 0.79 , 0.31 , and 0.37 , for the apparent h magnitude , redshift , and luminosity distributions , respectively .",
    "thus , the difference in the distributions is not statistically significant .",
    "the observation of j0040 + 8505a was taken during the end of the observing run , and the twilight was too bright for an adequate spectrum of the faint galaxy to be obtained .",
    "however , if strong features , such as those typical of a seyfert 1 , were present in j0040 + 8505a , they should still have been detected .",
    "as discussed , the spectrum of galaxy j0613 + 4752a is contaminated by a nearby star , most likely preventing any emission lines from being detected .",
    "therefore , the results of this study , excluding j0040 + 8505a and j0613 + 4752a , can be generalized to all the objects in the m99 survey .",
    "for most of the galaxies , [ o ii ] ( the strongest emission line after in typical starburst galaxies ) was expected to fall within the observed wavelength range , based on the redshifts published by m99 .",
    "other typically strong starburst emission lines expected ( based on local surveys ) to be seen in our optical / near - uv are , in approximate order of decreasing relative strength , h@xmath18 , [ ne iii ] 3869 , c ii ] 2326 , c iii ] 1909 , [ ne iv ] 2424 , [ o iii ] 4363 , and mg ii 2798 ( mcquade , calzetti , & kinney 1995 ; kennicutt 1992 ) . of",
    "the fourteen galaxies observed , nine had detectable emission lines , and all of those confirmed the redshift given by m99 . [ o ii ]",
    "was observed in each of the galaxies for which a redshift was obtained ( with the exception of j1237 + 6219c for which the wavelength range did not include [ o ii ] ) along with at least one other line , most often mg ii or [ ne iii ] . for seven of the galaxies ,",
    "three or more emission features were observed at redshifts consistent with m99 .",
    "if the galaxy is not a starburst , but rather an active galaxy , its spectrum could differ .",
    "for example , a seyfert 1 is identified by its broad ( v @xmath19 to @xmath20 km s@xmath10 ) permitted emission lines , e.g. , the balmer series and mg ii .",
    "the identification of a seyfert 2 or a low ionization nuclear emission - line region ( liner ) requires more effort , which will be discussed in @xmath124.6 .      of the 14 objects for which spectra were obtained , redshifts for nine of the objects confirm m99 s results .",
    "of these nine galaxies , one is a seyfert 1 , while the others exhibit typical starburst emission lines .",
    "figure 4 shows the regions of spectra containing emission lines for each galaxy . a more detailed plot of the region of the spectrum containing the [ o ii ] emission is shown in figure 5 .",
    "table 4 lists emission features observed , their known rest wavelengths , observed wavelengths , flux , significance levels , total error in the flux , and equivalent widths , along with the redshift we determine .",
    "the total error in the line fluxes not only includes the error due to noise in the spectrum , but also the error due to the various flux calibration steps discussed in @xmath122.1 . in each case",
    "the redshift measured confirms that given by m99 , with z@xmath21 z@xmath22 = 0.001 @xmath0 0.006 .",
    "we were unable to measure any emission features in the spectra of the remaining five objects .",
    "table 5 contains upper limits on emission lines for these unconfirmed galaxies , under the assumption that the redshift based on is correct .",
    "two of the unconfirmed galaxies , j0040 + 8505a and j0613 + 4752a , did not have adequate spectra , for reasons discussed below ; however upper limits are still given in table 5 .",
    "the other unconfirmed galaxies had no strong emission lines to allow a redshift determination .",
    "there are three possible explanations for a lack of detected emission lines : ( 1 ) the galaxies could be heavily reddened , which would significantly decrease the flux of the continuum and/or lines in the observed wavelength region ( optical / near - uv ) ; ( 2 ) the line observed by m99 is not , and we are therefore looking at a part of the spectrum devoid of strong emission lines ; or ( 3 ) the emission features were just too weak to be detected .",
    "the average color of our galaxy sample is r - h @xmath6 2.6 , indicating the continua of the galaxies are not heavily reddened .",
    "galaxies with a confirmed redshift have an average r - h @xmath6 2.9 compared to r - h @xmath6 1.9 for unconfirmed galaxies . excluding j0613 + 4752a , which has an uncertain magnitude measurement , and j0931 - 0049a , which is expected to be bluer because it is a seyfert 1 , the average for all galaxies changes to r - h @xmath6 2.8 . among this sample ,",
    "confirmed galaxies have an average r - h @xmath6 3.0 and unconfirmed galaxies r - h @xmath6 2.3 . since the unconfirmed galaxies are not redder than our confirmed galaxies , it is possible to eliminate the hypothesis that continuum reddening alone is the reason some galaxies were unable to have redshifts confirmed .",
    "the reddening of the galaxies in this sample is discussed further in @xmath124.2 .",
    "should the lack of features in our spectra be due to a misidentification of the line detected by m99 , other possible identifications are [ o iii ] 5007 , 4959 , h@xmath23  4861 , and [ o ii ] 3727 , observed at even higher redshifts than m99 supposed .",
    "the possibility of one of these other lines being a more likely identification of the feature detected by m99 is discussed further for the individual unconfirmed galaxies .",
    "all galaxies were unresolved , and their spatial profiles along the slit are consistent with a point source .",
    "notes on the individual galaxies follow .",
    "_ # 1 , j0040 + 8505a - _ this galaxy was observed at the very end of an observing night . as a result",
    ", the twilight dominates the spectrum , eliminating the possibility of detecting weak features that may be present in the galaxy spectrum .",
    "upper limits are reported , although they are not expected to place very accurate constraints on the emission line fluxes , since the detected flux is mostly due to twilight . however , if strong emission features were present , like those typical of seyfert 1s ( osterbrock 1989 ) , then these features would have been detected .",
    "therefore , based on its upper limits , this galaxy is not a seyfert 1 .    _ # 2 , j0050 + 8518a _ - this emission - line galaxy has six @xmath24 3 @xmath25 emission lines and five weaker features , which confirmed the redshift to be 0.758 @xmath0 0.003 .",
    "the overall high strength of the lines could suggest that the galaxy is a seyfert 2 ( mccarthy 1993 ) .",
    "however , the relatively weak [ ne iii]/compared to [ o ii]/(see @xmath124.6 ) leads us to classify the galaxy as a strong starburst .    _ # 3 , j0613 + 4752a _ - no believable emission features are present in the spectrum of this object .",
    "the proximity of this galaxy ( about 2@xmath16 ) to an @xmath26 mag star causes starlight contamination in the spectrum of this galaxy .",
    "the majority of the flux detected in the spectrum is starlight ; thus the upper limits reported for this object do not place very tight constraints on the actual galaxy line flux .",
    "according to the average broad line strengths of seyfert 1s given by osterbrock ( 1989 ) , this object can not be rejected , based on its upper limits , as a possible seyfert 1 . assuming the redshift published by m99 , z = 1.04 , [ o ii ]",
    "should be located at 7603 @xmath0 56   which is where the a band atmospheric absorption is located .",
    "this indicates that if strong [ o ii ] emission were present , then it might have been missed due to this atmospheric feature .",
    "it is not possible to determine if one of the alternative identification discussed above for the emission line detected by m99 is more likely than another .    _ # 4 , j0622 - 0018a _ - this emission - line galaxy has three @xmath24 3 @xmath25 emission lines and five weaker features , which confirmed the redshift to be 1.135 @xmath0 0.002 .",
    "the strongest line , [ o ii ] , is in a region of strong sky emission .",
    "the sky subtraction was not perfect and resulted in altering the shape ( and thus the flux measurement ) and possibly the central wavelength of the feature .",
    "this causes a redshift estimate based on [ o ii ] to be only 1.123 , which deviates from 1.135 by more than our estimated error in redshift .",
    "for this reason , the [ o ii ] feature is not included in the redshift estimate . based on the expected observed wavelength of [ o ii ] and",
    "instrumental fwhm , it can be estimated that as much as 15% of the flux may have been missed because of poor sky subtraction .",

    "thus , using a transformation based on our sample causes even greater uncertainty in the resulting transformed [ o ii ] lf .",
    "the [ o ii]/values used for the eight h98 points , from left to right in figure 11b , are as follows : 0.10 , 0.10 , 0.10 , 0.16 , 0.36 , 0.52 , 0.70 , 0.90 .",
    "for the first three points , [ o ii]/=0.10 was assumed , instead of the negative value given by the fit . as figure 11b demonstrates , using these more accurate values results in the h98 transformed [ o ii ] lf being slightly lower than the lfs given by yan et al . and hopkins et al . at the highest luminosities ,",
    "although they agree within the errors .    the h98 [ o ii ] lf is higher than the lfs in figure 11a and slightly lower in figure 11b as a result of our observed [ o ii ] values being lower than those in the h98 study . as previously stated , the local luminosity-[o ii]/relationship , is not enough to explain the difference in the lfs between our sample and that of h98 .",
    "if the dependence of [ o ii]/on luminosity is stronger in higher redshift galaxies , then the lf discrepancy may be expected . also , the differences at the bright end of the lf could be due to the small numbers . with the steep slope in the lf",
    ", small systematic errors could lead to large differences in the derived lf .",
    "should neither of the above scenarios be responsible for the discrepancy in the lfs , the difference is most likely attributable to additional reddening in our sample .",
    "this does not necessarily mean the two surveys observed galaxies from completely separate populations .",
    "it is possible that the two studies are observing galaxies from a single population of galaxies , but that the subsamples are from different sides of a broad distribution .",
    "thus , the differing selection effects imposed on the galaxy population , which has an intrinsically wide range of [ o ii]/ha values , causes the two samples to contain different cuts of the same population .",
    "the m99 sample was selected on luminosity in a grism survey .",
    "this method has a bias towards bright , compact sources , which causes our sample to have a higher average absolute _",
    "b_-band luminosity than those in the h98 sample , which were selected by _",
    "r_-band magnitude .",
    "our higher - luminosity objects lead to a lower intrinsic [ o ii]/ , and thus galaxies with lower [ o ii ] are more likely to be observed in our sample . as stated , this difference in intrinsic [ o ii]/alone does not , most likely , explain the difference in lfs of the two samples , unless the dependence on luminosity is greater at higher redshifts than observed in local galaxies . to explain the large discrepancy in lfs , it is also necessary to assume that our galaxies have more reddening ( see @xmath124.2 ) . based on the _ r_-band magnitudes of our 14 galaxies , only four would have been selected by h98 , suggesting that , on average , the m99 galaxies have more dust extinction than the h98 sample .",
    "thus , if a sample is chosen based on emission , lower [ o ii]/than those observed in an _",
    "r_-band magnitude selected sample are more likely to be observed due to the increased reddening and lower intrinsic [ o ii]/ratios .",
    "the selection methods for the two samples may , therefore , have limited the surveys to different subsections of the total population , causing neither one to sample the entire population completely .",
    "further support for this theory is provided by recent work by aragn - salamanca et al .",
    "as mentioned in @xmath12 4.1 , they found that their -selected sample of local galaxies had significantly more reddening than the local jansen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) sample , which was _ b_-band - selected .",
    "this additional reddening resulting in an observed mean [ o ii]/that is half that observed in the jansen et al",
    "therefore , even at low redshift , there is such a wide range in the distribution of [ o ii]/and e(b - v ) that different selection methods select subsamples with significantly different properties .",
    "this same argument can be used to explain why the pettini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) study , which consists of z @xmath6 3 galaxies , has [ o ii]/values consistent with the jansen et al .",
    "relationship , while we do not .",
    "the pettini et al .",
    "sample has an average _ r - h _",
    "= 1.2 @xmath0 0.2 , if _ h - k _ = 1.2 is assumed , which is a reasonable estimate for z @xmath6 3 galaxies ( chen et al .",
    "2002 ) . this _",
    "r - h _ color is much lower than our average , found to be _ r - h_=2.6@xmath01.0 .",
    "the _ h - k _ color must be assumed to be less than 0.8 for the average color of the pettini et al .",
    "sample to be consistent with our average color .",
    "therefore , it is likely that our sample has more reddening then the pettini et al .",
    "sample , thus leading to a lower observed [ o ii]/. however , the glazebrook et al .",
    "sample , which is also consistent with the jansen et al .",
    "relationship with a sample at z @xmath6 1 , can not be explained in this way .",
    "the _ j - h _",
    "colors for their sample are similar to our sample , indicating that there is no significant difference in the degree of reddening .",
    "the glazebrook sample was selected based on _",
    "i_-band magnitude , and if _ r - i _",
    "= 2.0 is assumed then only 3 of our galaxies out of the 14 would have been missed in their sample .",
    "the average m@xmath32 of the two samples only differ by 0.4 mag , and the average redshift of the glazebrook sample is lower than that of our sample .",
    "however , there is enough overlap in the redshift ranges covered in our sample and the glazebrook sample , that their average observed [ o ii]/is not expected to be a factor of 3.7 discrepant .",
    "although continuum reddening does not seem to be responsible for this discrepancy , it is possible that the difference in the studies is due to reddening in the line emission , instead of the continuum .",
    "thus , when deriving the sfr - l([o ii ] ) relationship , it is necessary not only to consider the dependence of [ o ii]/on luminosity , but also , at least when working at z @xmath58 1 , to assess the degree of reddening . because of the wide range in [ o ii]/in our study and the others mentioned above , it is possible that the e(b - v ) extinction in the observed galaxy population can vary by more than a factor of 4 mag .",
    "standard diagnostic diagrams ( baldwin , philips , & terlevich 1981 ) are valuable for classifying emission - line galaxies based on their optical lines",
    ". however , these diagrams are only useful for those galaxies at low enough redshifts for the necessary emission lines to be available at optical wavelengths .",
    "the only diagnostic emission lines generally available at the rest wavelength ranges observed for our eight galaxies are [ o ii ] and [ ne iii ] 3869 . by comparing the luminosity of each of these lines to , it is still possible to classify emission galaxies as either a seyfert 2 or a starburst galaxy ( rola , terlevich , & terlevich 1997 ) .",
    "this diagnostic does not work well for identification of liners .",
    "using an assumed balmer decrement of 6 , the luminosities published by m99 can be converted into  luminosities . the contribution of [ n ii ]  6583 , 6548 to the + [ n ii ] blend is assumed to be [ n ii]/@xmath6  0.5 ( kennicutt 1992 ) for starbursts .",
    "figure 12 shows the position of our galaxies that have both [ o ii ] and [ ne iii ] measurements compared to those galaxies observed by rola et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "all of our galaxies lie within the range for starburst galaxies , which is given by rola et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to be at log([ne iii ] 3869/ ) @xmath53 -0.2 .",
    "increasing the balmer decrement would push them closer to the area containing the seyfert 2s , but still well within the region of starburst galaxies .",
    "an implausibly high decrement , greater than /  = 15 , is needed in order to classify j0622 - 0018a , the most likely candidate in our sample , as a seyfert 2 .",
    "another adjustment that can be made is the contribution of [ n ii ] , which is closer to [ n ii]/@xmath6  1.0 ( mcquade et al . 1995 ) for seyfert 2s .",
    "this would also increase the ratio [ ne iii ] 3869/ , but by a smaller amount than from increasing the balmer decrement . even if a higher contribution of [ n ii ] is used , which can be as high as [ n ii]/@xmath6  1.5 ( see , e.g. , malkan @xmath59 oke 1983 ) , in combination with a reasonably high balmer decrement , it is still not possible to classify any of our galaxies as a seyfert 2 using this diagnostic . we thus conclude that even though j0622 - 0018a and j0055 + 8518a have emission features that might lead one to suspect they are seyfert 2s , they should still be classified as starburst galaxies .",
    "in an effort to identify seyfert 1s that were assumed to be starburst galaxies in the m99 survey , a new diagnostic diagram is used . comparing the rest equivalent width to the luminosity of the line",
    "suggests that seyfert 1s may be separated from starburst galaxies using the criteria that they have @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see fig . 13 ) .",
    "these limits were determined by eye , guided by the number of seyfert 1s expected in the m99 sample ( see @xmath124.8 ) , and should only be taken to be approximate values .",
    "a separation can also be made comparing the absolute h ( 1.65 ) magnitude to the luminosity of .",
    "figure 14 shows that seyfert 1s may be separated from starburst galaxies by again having @xmath60 as well as @xmath62 .",
    "galaxies that fit both of the above criteria are most likely seyfert 1s .",
    "these criteria indicate that not only is j0931 - 0449a a seyfert 1 , but also that j0917 + 8142a and j0923 + 8149a are good seyfert 1 candidates .",
    "in addition , j0917 + 8142c is a good candidate due to , as m99 noted , its large equivalent width and compact morphology .",
    "j0917 + 8142c meets the first criterion , but no _ h_-band magnitude was obtained by m99 to enable its placement on the @xmath63 versus @xmath64 plot .",
    "it is most likely that it would be place well within the seyfert 1 area of the plot .",
    "j0738 + 0507a , although it only satisfies one of the above criterions , is also a good candidate due to its compact morphology observed by m99 .      of our 14 galaxies",
    ", we were able to confirm the redshifts of nine , and of these , one is a seyfert 1 ( j0931 - 0449a ) . assuming our galaxies are representative of the survey and",
    "that a seyfert 1 could not have been missed in our other eight spectra , this gives a seyfert 1 comoving number density of @xmath65 ; this comoving number density is 1/9 of the total galaxy comoving number density found by m99 .",
    "errors were estimated from poisson statistics ( gehrels 1986 ) .",
    "if this comoving number density is correct , there should be 2 or 3 other seyfert 1s in the 33-galaxy survey .",
    "furthermore , assuming the redshifts of the four unconfirmed galaxies ( excluding j0613 + 4752a which can not be excluded as a possible seyfert 1 ; see @xmath123.2 ) are correct , based on the emission line , and that emission lines would have been detected if they were seyfert 1s , the comoving number density decreases to 1/13 of the total density found by m99 , giving @xmath66 . in this case there",
    "should then be 1 or 2 other seyfert 1s among the survey galaxies . if instead it is assumed that j0613 + 4752a is a seyfert 1 as well",
    ", then the commoving number density is 2/14 of the total density found by m99 , giving @xmath67 .",
    "a method to identify these likely seyfert 1 galaxies was discussed in @xmath124.7 , as were the most likely candidates .",
    "the number of quasars / seyfert 1s of a given luminosity at a given redshift is fairly uncertain at the redshifts of the fourteen galaxies in this study .",
    "grazian et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , using a luminosity dependent luminosity evolution ( ldle ) model , suggest that the number density of seyfert 1s within the absolute blue magnitude range of -21 to -25 and redshifts @xmath68 is 1.1@xmath69 .",
    "we therefore had an expectation value of 0.39 seyfert 1 galaxies in our sample of 13 galaxies ( which excludes j0613 + 4752a for reasons stated earlier ) .",
    "the probability of the observation of one seyfert 1 galaxy in our sample being consistent with the expected value of 0.39 is 26% .",
    "the consistency of our result with the prediction of the ldle model can not , therefore , be ruled out at a high significance level .",
    "however , if we take our observation of one seyfert 1 galaxy in our sample as representative of the whole m99 sample , then this gives a comoving number density a factor of 2.4@xmath70 times higher , which , within the error , is still marginally consistent with the ldle model prediction .",
    "observations have been made of 14 galaxies , which constitute a subset of the 33 galaxies detected by m99 in an grism survey covering 64 arcmin@xmath8 .",
    "the redshifts of 9 of these 14 galaxies confirmed m99 s results , with improved accuracy .",
    "of the five galaxies with unconfirmed redshifts , two , j0040 + 8505a and j0613 + 4752a , did not have adequate spectra .",
    "either the other three were either too faint ( possibly because of reddening ) , or the emission detected in the survey was not actually , and we were looking at a part of the galaxy s spectrum that contains no detectable emission lines .",
    "our sample of galaxies have lower observed [ o ii]/than both the kennicutt ( 1992 ) and jansen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) samples .",
    "these lower [ o ii]/ratios are most likely due to a greater dependence of the ratio on luminosity at higher redshifts , as well as additional reddening , as compared to local galaxies .",
    "should the lower [ o ii]/be due solely to reddening , then our sample has an average e(b - v ) = 0.59 @xmath0 0.34 mag of additional reddening , which , when combined with the e ( ) = 1 mag already included by kennicutt , results in an average total reddening of e(b - v ) = 1.08 @xmath0 0.34 mag .",
    "the lower observed [ o ii]/found in our sample result in a lower volume - averaged sfr density , with our sample an average of 4 @xmath0 2 times lower than that given by m99 . comparing our sample to h98 , which is also based on [ o ii ]",
    ", it is found that our volume - averaged sfr density is at least a factor of 2.6 times lower .",
    "this discrepancy between studies based on the same sfr indicator is most likely due to a sample of galaxies with a wide range in [ o ii]/ , this range being caused by a wide range in reddening , as well as intrinsic [ o ii]/values .",
    "one galaxy , j0931 - 0449a , is a seyfert 1 , based on its broad emission lines .",
    "the remaining galaxies are considered starburst galaxies , based on their placement in a diagnostic diagram using [ o ii ] 3727 , [ ne iii ] 3869 , and .",

    ", j0917 + 8142c , j0923 + 8149a , and probably j0738 + 0507a , which were not observed in this study , are also likely seyfert 1 candidates .",

    "<S> optical spectra of 14 emission - line galaxies representative of the 1999 nicmos parallel grism survey of mccarthy et al . are presented . of the 14 , 9 have emission lines confirming the redshifts found in the grism survey . </S>",
    "<S> the higher resolution of our optical spectra improves the redshift accuracy by a factor of 5 . </S>",
    "<S> the [ o ii]/values of our sample are found to be more than two times lower than expected from jansen et al . </S>",
    "<S> this [ o ii]/ratio discrepancy is most likely explained by additional reddening in our -selected sample [ on average , as much as an extra e(b - v ) = 0.6 ] , as well as to a possible stronger dependence of the [ o ii]/ratio on galaxy luminosity than is found in local galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the result is that star formation rates ( sfrs ) calculated from [ o ii ] 3727 emission , uncorrected for extinction , are found to be on average 4 @xmath0 2 times lower than the sfrs calculated from emission . </S>",
    "<S> classification of emission - line galaxies as starburst or seyfert galaxies based on comparison of the ratios [ o ii]/  and [ ne iii ] 3869/  is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> new seyfert 1 diagnostics using the line luminosity , _ </S>",
    "<S> h_-band absolute magnitude , and equivalent widths are also presented . </S>",
    "<S> one galaxy is classified as a seyfert 1 based on its broad emission lines , implying a comoving number density for seyfert 1s of @xmath1 10@xmath2 mpc@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this commoving number density is a factor of 2.4@xmath4 times higher than estimated by other surveys . </S>"
