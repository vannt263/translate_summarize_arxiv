    "variability in the nuclei of planetary nebulae ( pne ) has been studied for decades , with renewed interest in the past few years in order to understand the frequency of pne with binary central stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the role they might play in shaping the host nebula morphology and evolution . variability within the nebulae themselves is less commonly reported , but when present has been attributed to a variety of causes .",
    "for example @xcite attributed changes in excitation of the nebulae ic  4997 and ngc  6572 to an increase in the temperature of the central stars ( css ) ; and @xcite reported two episodes of a deep fading and consequent re - brightening of the cs of ngc  2346 , which they attributed to dust clouds within a pn passing in between the cs and the observer .",
    "more recently , @xcite described the remarkable morphological evolution and photometric variation of m29 , which they attributed to the interaction of ejected matter between a jet from the cs and the surrounding pn ; @xcite and later @xcite argue from detailed uv and optical spectroscopy and ir photometry that he2104 is a pn with a symbiotic ( white dwarf plus a mira variable ) central star ; and @xcite obtained extensive uv and visual - band spectra of the complex nebula lmc ",
    "smp  83 , which they attribute to episodic bipolar ejections from a non - degenerate secondary in a close orbit with a white dwarf .",
    "we have initiated a study of photometric variability in large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) pne in order to make use of a very large , complete sample to set limits on the fraction of pn central stars that have companions of some sort , and to explore the frequency of other patterns of variability .",
    "we have used data from the extensive supermacho photometric survey at ctio of the lmc which was obtained over a  4.2 year period from 2002 through the end of 2005 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "one object , rpj  053059683542 ( hereafter referred to by its common catalog name , rp916 ) , was found to have spatially resolved variability , which is a highly unusual phenomenon that to date has only one other rough analog : the variability in the galactic pn m29 .",
    "rp916 was discovered by @xcite in the anglo - australian observatory ( aao)/ukst deep h@xmath0 survey of the lmc , who classified it as a `` true '' planetary nebula based on its morphology and spectral characteristics .",
    "it is one of the largest pne known in the lmc , and has a bipolar morphology .",
    "aside from the near uniqueness of the phenomenon , this type of variability is highly suggestive of an interaction of the pn central star with an otherwise undetectable binary companion .",
    "we describe in  2 the extant observations for rp916 , including the photometric campaign , optical spectroscopy , and broad - band ir photometry from the 2mass catalog and from the sage survey with the _ spitzer space telescope_. we analyze the characteristics of the variability in  3 , and suggest interpretations that are most consistent with the observations in  4 .",
    "even before @xcite reported the initial discovery , a good deal of ground- and space - based data had accumulated on rp  916 , including broad - band optical and infrared images , and optical spectra .",
    "interestingly , the bulk of the observations were obtained during the course of surveys of the lmc that were designed with purposes other than pn research in mind .",
    "the primary optical images that were used for this study were obtained as a part of the supermacho survey of a 23 deg@xmath1 region centered on the bar of the lmc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details of the observing campaign ) .",
    "eighty - two images in the vicinity of rp916 were obtained with the mosaic - ii ccd camera on the blanco 4-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory between 2002 january and 2005 december .",
    "most images were taken with a broad @xmath2 filter with a passband that covers 510740  nm and includes the strong nebular emission lines such as h@xmath0 and [ ] @xmath3 , but avoids [ ] @xmath4 .",
    "this wide bandpass enabled the detection of faint objects ( @xmath5 ) within the typical 150  s exposures of the survey .",
    "the ccd plate scale is 027 pixel@xmath6 , which samples the psf very well : the delivered image quality varied from roughly 08 to 20 over the course of the observing campaigns .",
    "an atmospheric dispersion corrector was used to minimize the differential atmospheric dispersion through the broad filter at the typical airmass of 1.3 to 1.4 .",
    "the supermacho data were processed with an automatic pipeline @xcite that corrects for electronic cross - talk between the amplifiers , removes the bias level , and applies a flat - field .",
    "the images were re - projected to a common geometry , with an rms accuracy of @xmath7  mas .",
    "the psfs are then matched , the images are corrected for sky background , and placed on a common photometric scale prior to template subtraction . the template image ( see  3 ) is shown in the left - hand side of figure  [ fig : images ] , and was selected based on the good image quality ( @xmath8 ) and the excellent photometric quality of the night on which this image was obtained .",
    "the discovery images used by @xcite were obtained as part of an aao / ukst deep photographic survey in h@xmath0 and in @xmath9band continuum , and were obtained between 1998 and 2000 .",
    "the 70    bandwidth of the h@xmath0 filter also includes the [ ] emission lines at @xmath3 .",
    "the photometric depth of the stacked images is @xmath10 in @xmath11 and @xmath12 for h@xmath0 .",
    "the digitized images were sampled at 067 pixel@xmath6 , and the image resolution is roughly 35 . as described by @xcite , the stacked h@xmath0 and @xmath9band images were each assigned a specific color in the final .",
    "the discovery image of rp916 is shown in the right - hand side of figure  [ fig : images ] .",
    "fortuitously , additional images were obtained by one of us ( a.r . ) with _ hubble space telescope _ using the wfpc2 camera .",
    "these images were obtained to study a microlensing target , but happened to include rp916 at the edge of the field of view . in all , four images were obtained on 2007 may 17 : u9px0601 m and u9px0602 m with the f555w filter , and u9px0603 m and u9px0604 m with the f814w filter .",
    "the exposure times were all 500  s. we combined the calibrated images for each filter to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and to remove cosmic - rays . the f814w image is shown in figure  [ fig : hst ] .",
    "@xcite obtained two confirmatory spectra of rp916 on 2004 december 14 with the 2df fiber spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope : one with a dispersion of 4.3    pixel@xmath6 and the other with a dispersion of 1.1    pixel@xmath6 .",
    "the higher - dispersion spectrum was used to resolve close emission line blends and to determine the radial velocity .",
    "since the angular size of the nebula exceeds the areal coverage of the fiber , the spectra actually correspond to the western lobe of rp916 .",
    "the spectra show moderately low excitation , with f ( [ ] @xmath4)/f(h@xmath13 ) @xmath14 , relatively strong [ ] @xmath15 and [ ] @xmath16 , weak [ ] @xmath17 , no detectable emission , and moderate [ ] with f(@xmath18+@xmath19)/f(h@xmath0 ) @xmath20 .",
    "rp916 is a moderately strong infrared source ( for a pn in the lmc ) , based on the 2mass @xmath21 magnitudes @xcite that were obtained on 2000 february 20 ( mjd 51,602 ) .",
    "it was also detected in the mid - ir sage survey with _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ @xcite in the @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 bands with irac , and the @xmath25 band with mips ( the @xmath26 and @xmath27 band catalog data have yet to be published ) .",
    "the first epoch sage observations were obtained during 2005 july 1526 , around mjd 53,570 .",
    "the ir brightnesses are given in table  [ tab : irphot ] .",
    "all of the optical images show that rp916 has a `` butterfly '' bipolar morphology @xcite , with a dark lane ( 046 , or 0.11 pc , in width ) bisecting the pinched main lobes of emission .",
    "the extent of the nebula is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 pc at the distance of the lmc ) as measured from a contour at 10% of the peak nebular brightness in the f814w image ; the extent is roughly twice as large when measured just above the sky level , with a substantial extension of faint nebular material to the ene of the geometric center of the nebula .",
    "the h@xmath30 color image shows that the emission is almost entirely nebular : what little continuum is evident in the @xmath9band image undoubtedly originates from a combination of nebular continuum , emission lines in the @xmath11 bandpass , and the few very faint field stars that are seen in the _ hst _ image .",
    "interestingly , a faint star is evident in the f814w image , within the waist of rp916 , offset by @xmath31 from the symmetry axis defined by the optical emission .",
    "the star is barely visible in the f555w image however , indicating that it is intrinsically very red , or suffers heavy extinction from dust within the waist of the nebula .",
    "it is not clear whether this is the central star of the nebula .",
    "the more detailed _ hst _ images show clumps of emission , with the brightest knots or lobes extending almost symmetrically to the east and west but do not intersect at the geometric center of the nebula .",
    "the appearance of rp916 in the 2mass images that of an extended point source , with no sign of bi - lobed structure ; the object is not resolved in the _ spitzer _ irac or mips images . although the confirmatory spectra of @xcite are neither deep nor well enough calibrated to support a detailed abundance analysis , @xcite derived an approximate density for rp916 of @xmath32  @xmath33 from the [ ]  @xmath34 line ratio .",
    "the amount of extinction , while only roughly determined , appears to be higher than average ( @xmath35 ) for an lmc pn ; given the strong ir emission , some of the extinction may be intrinsic to the nebula .",
    "finally , the modest ratio of f([])/f(h@xmath0 ) suggests that n is not highly enriched .",
    "the various , general properties of rp916 are summarized in table  [ tab : properties ] .",
    "the original point of our work was to search for variability in planetary nebulae .",
    "this search was enabled by using the automated pipeline developed for the supermacho project , which makes use of a very powerful difference image technique ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in brief ,",
    "all of the images are resampled to the same geometry and sky subtracted , and the images are placed on the same photometric scale .",
    "the psf of the template image is then matched to each target image via convolution , and subtracted .",
    "the result of this subtraction on four selected nights is shown in figure  [ fig : diff_img ] , where the difference has the value 0.0 everywhere ( apart from shot noise ) except for features that are either fainter or brighter than those in the template image .",
    "photometry is then performed at the positions of the lobes on the difference image for each observation .",
    "this technique has been shown to yield accurate photometry even in crowded fields such as the lmc , and is extremely robust against non - photometric conditions .",
    "light curves were determined for the eastern and western lobes of rp916 , which are shown in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] .",
    "note that both lobes increased in brightness compared to the template image , but some time after the second year of the observing campaign the eastern lobe began to fade while the western lobe continued to brighten . by mjd",
    "@xmath36 july the western lobe began to fade , but more slowly than the eastern lobe .",
    "close inspection of figure  [ fig : diff_img ] suggests that the orientation of the brightness enhancement in the western lobe changed and became elongated by mjd @xmath37 dec . the western lobe brightened by nearly 40% during the course of the observing campaign .",
    "rp916 is unusual in many respects , including its large physical size , strong ir emission , and optical variability .",
    "but the morphology and moderate ionization spectrum leave little doubt that it is a genuine planetary nebula , and the measured radial velocity establishes its location in the lmc . if the central star of rp916 has a binary companion that is very red and luminous it could contribute to the near - ir continuum luminosity , but it can not account for the extreme colors in the mid - ir .",
    "note , however , that since the epochs of the 2mass and sage observations differ by 5.4 years it is possible that the ratio of the near- to far - ir luminosity could have changed somewhat during that time .",
    "we conclude that rp916 contains a large amount of dust ( which might be expected given the pinched waist and the dark band that bisects the nebula ) .",
    "if rp916 is similar to other lmc pne with significant dust , both molecular emission features and thermal continuum radiation contribute substantially to the total ir flux , particularly in the mid - ir ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the nebular variability is the most unusual feature of this object , and it is difficult to think of a cause that does not involve a binary star as the central engine . indeed , the lack of an extreme n enrichment , which is typical of bipolar pne in the lmc @xcite is consistent with common - envelope evolution , where the expected conversion of c to n via hot - bottom burning is suppressed .",
    "it may be that the variation resulted from an outburst from a red companion . in this case",
    "a change in optical luminosity might be manifested in the nebula as a light echo seen in scattered light from dust within the nebula .",
    "( note that the phase lag of @xmath38  d between the peak emission of the two lobes in figure  [ fig : lightcurve ] would imply a significant inclination out of the plane of the sky .",
    ") however , no mira - like periodicity is detected over the 1450  d observing campaign .",
    "it seems unlikely that the variation is from a global change in ionizing photons , as the inferred h recombination timescale is @xmath39  yr if the derived density is representative of the whole nebula . in any case",
    ", a light echo can not explain the radial structures that are evident in the detailed _ hst _ images .",
    "the variability might on the other hand result from a precessing jet of material from the central source that interacts with ( i.e. , shocks ) the surrounding nebula .",
    "other pne that show a similar photometric variability , resulting from a symbiotic companion , are the galactic bipolar pn he2104 @xcite , and lmc - smp  83 @xcite .",
    "@xcite interpreted the variability within m29 as an interaction of a jet from the central source interacting with the surrounding pn , which has over time continued to shape the nebular morphology . while this mechanism is an interesting possibility for rp916 , confirmation would require long - slit spectroscopy to measure the velocity field , high - resolution ( @xmath40 or better ) imaging in h@xmath0 to reveal the time - dependent morphology of the variability , imaging polarimetry to measure the extent of any scattered light by dust , and infrared spectra to understand the nature of the ir luminosity and ( possibly ) detect a red , luminous companion star .",
    "the frequency of nebular variability generally among pne is not known , but rp916 may be the most extreme example of how pne morphology can be re - shaped even at very advanced stages of evolution .",
    "photometric monitoring at high spatial resolution of a sizable sample of bipolar pne in the lmc is crucial for determining what fraction of pne experience the unusual variability of rp916 .",
    "perhaps the observing campaigns of the next generation of survey telescopes such as that for lsst , which will have the necessary depth , sky coverage , and cadence , can help to resolve this broader question .",
    "support for this work was provided by noao , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nsf cooperative agreement nas526555 .",
    "the supermacho survey was conducted under the auspices of the noao survey program .",
