    "although principally devoted to studies of compact galactic sources and active galactic nuclei , the beppo - sax satellite has devoted a small fraction of time to galaxy cluster observations .",
    "the primary motivation for performing observations of galaxy clusters with beppo - sax is the high spatial resolution of the mecs instruments . in these proceedings",
    "i briefly review the beppo - sax observational program for galaxy clusters . after having listed contributions on galaxy clusters to these proceedings by other authors",
    "i describe results from the analysis of the perseus observation .",
    "the mecs instrument on board beppo - sax is well suited for the analysis of extended sources .",
    "as discussed in giommi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in these proceedings , the effective area of the 3 mecs units is comparable to that of the 2 gis units on board asca in the 2 - 10 kev ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "the point spread function of the mecs is significantly sharper than that of the asca gis ( see giommi et al . 1998 figure 2 ) . at 6.4",
    "kev the half power radius ( hpr ) of the mecs psf is @xmath0 1 arcmin while the hpr of the asca gis psf is @xmath0 2 arcmin .",
    "moreover , unlike the asca gis psf , the mecs psf does not vary strongly with energy ( see fig.1 of dacri et al .",
    "1998 , these proceedings ) .",
    "another important point is that the instrumental background for the mecs units on - board beppo - sax is quite low @xmath1 in the 1.5 - 10 kev band to be compared with @xmath2 in the same band for the gis units on board asca .",
    "moreover , due to the low inclination orbit adopted by the beppo - sax satellite , the background is extremely stable .",
    "the beppo - sax observing program includes observations of a few galaxy cluster .",
    "a list of observations scheduled and performed is presented in these proceedings by pallavicini ( see his table 3 ) .",
    "almost all these observations are devoted to extended objects , the main aim being spatially resolved spectroscopy . within these proceedings",
    "beppo - sax observations of galaxy clusters are presented by a few authors .",
    "kaastra et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss spatially resolved spectroscopy of a2199 .",
    "they find evidence of a spectral hardening in the outer parts of this cluster .",
    "moreover , using pds data they confirm the presence of a hard tail in a2199 .",
    "colafrancesco et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discuss the analysis of 2 intermediate redshift clusters namely a33 and a348 .",
    "they combine their data with previous asca measurements to place constraints on the @xmath3 relationship at @xmath4 .",
    "dacri et al .",
    "discuss an analysis technique which they have developed to correct for the spectral distortions introduced by the energy dependent mecs psf .",
    "they apply this technique to the core of the virgo cluster finding a temperature decrement towards the inner parts of cluster , in agreement with previous measurements made with rosat and asca .",
    "the central region of the perseus cluster was observed by the beppo - sax satellite ( boella , butler et al .",
    "97 ) between the 20@xmath5 and the 21@xmath6 of september 1996 during the science verification phase ( svp ) .",
    "the observation was rather long with a total effective exposure of 89 ks for the medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) ( boella , chiappetti et al .",
    "97 ) , 38 ks for the hpgspc instrument ( manzo et al . 1997 ) and 30 ks for the pds instrument ( frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "i have accumulated a mecs spectrum from a region centered on the emission peak using an extraction radius of 6.4 arcmin .",
    "i have fitted the mecs , hpgspc and pds spectra simultaneously using a thermal emission code ( mekal in xspec version 9.01 ) absorbed by an equivalent hydrogen column density of n@xmath7 @xmath8 the fit to the broad band spectrum ( figure 1 ) shows an excess of the data with respect to the model at energies e 20 kev .",
    "this excess can not be fitted with a thermal component , unless an unphysical temperature of more than 20 kev is assumed .",
    "a power - law component fits adequately the high energy excess .",
    "the intensity of the power - law component is @xmath9 erg @xmath8s@xmath10 in the 20 - 100 kev band .",
    "comparison of our measurement with previous detections by oso7 ( rothschild et al . 1981 ) , heao1 ( levine et al . 1984 ) and with the osse upper limit ( osako et al . 1994 ) indicate that the power - law component is undergoing a secular decrease in intensity .",
    "an asca analysis of the central region of perseus ( fabian et al . 94 ) shows that the spectrum below 3 kev is strongly contaminated by a cooling flow . by comparing the surface brightness profile of perseus in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev band , derived from the analysis of rosat pspc archive data , with a king profile we find that the cooling flow extends out to @xmath0 8 arcmin , corresponding to 240 kpc .",
    "i have attempted to spatially resolve the cooling flow component with the mecs by analyzing spectra from 4 concentric annuli centered on the emission peak and with bounding radii of 0 - 2 arcmin , 2 - 4 arcmin , 4 - 6 arcmin and 6 - 8 arcmin respectively .",
    "i have fitted each spectrum in the 3.5 - 10 kev range with a thermal model ( mekal ) allowing the temperature and the abundances to be free .",
    "i have then reintroduced the data in the 1.5 - 3.5 kev range and plotted the residuals to the fits ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "as can be clearly seen the relative intensity of the cooling flow component decreases as the radial distance from the peak of the emission increases ( the increase observed when going from panel 1 to panel 2 is due to instrumental effects , more specifically the detector psf , below 3 kev , redistributes a large fraction of photons coming from a circular region with a radius of 2 arcmin over a larger region ) .",
    "as described in the previous subsection i have fitted spectra accumulated in concentric annuli with a thermal emission model . in figure 3",
    "i plot the temperature derived from the fits . in order to avoid contamination from the cooling flow",
    "the fits were performed in the 3 - 10 kev band .",
    "our data clearly indicates that the temperature presents a strong gradient in perseus over a region of 8 arcmin ( corresponding to 240 kpc ) in radius .",
    "i have accumulated a mecs spectrum from a circular region centered on the emission peak using an extraction radius of 6.4 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath0 200 kpc .",
    "i have modeled the spectrum in the 3 - 10 kev band using a bremsstrahlung for the continuum and two gaussian lines , one for the 6.8 kev iron complex , the other for the 8 kev iron - nickel complex .",
    "data at energies below 3 kev has been excluded because significantly contaminated by the cooling flow .",
    "i find a temperature of @xmath11 kev for the continuum component , an energy e@xmath12 kev and a width @xmath13 kev for the lower energy line and an energy e@xmath14 kev and a width @xmath15 kev for the higher energy line , where both e@xmath16 and e@xmath17 are given in the source rest - frame .",
    "the 8 kev feature is clearly broad and most likely due to a blend of different lines from highly ionized iron ( fe xxv and fe xxvi ) and nickel ( ni xxvii ) .",
    "fits with thermal emission codes such as meka , mekal or raymond & smith do not reproduce satisfactorily the 8 kev feature , all these models underestimate significantly the intensity of the emission feature , the reason being that all the above codes predict an 8 kev over 6.8 kev line intensity ratio in the range 0.11 - 0.13 against an observed ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "the most convincing explanation i have found for the observed anomalous ratio involves a process known as resonant scattering ( a detailed discussion of alternative explanations and of other aspects of the line ratio analysis is presented in molendi et al .",
    "the inter - galactic medium in clusters , while optically thin to the continuum and many lines , may be optically thick in the center of some lines . indeed the process describing the absorption of an fe k@xmath19 line photon by an iron ion followed by the immediate re - emission , which is known as resonant scattering , can be quite effective for typical cluster gas densities and temperatures .",
    "gilfanov et al .",
    "( 86 ) have shown that the cores of rich cluster , such as perseus and virgo , should have optical depths , for the above process , of the order of a few .",
    "if the gas is optically thick to resonant scattering , the line emission coming from the core of the cluster will be attenuated because of the photons which are scattered out of the line of sight .",
    "if this is the case then the abundances measured using standard thermal emission codes , which assume optically thin thermal emission , can be significantly underestimated . in figure 4",
    "i show the abundance profiles computed under the assumption of optically thin line emission ( open circles ) and of optically thick emission , using 2 different methods ( filled circles and open squares ) .",
    "i find that the the fe abundance in the innermost circular region , with radius 2 arcmin , corresponding to @xmath0 60 kpc , is @xmath0 0.9 solar and consistent with 1 .",
    "the obvious implication is that a very large fraction of the gas in the core of perseus has been processed in stars .",
    "i acknowledge support of various nature from my colleagues in the beppo - sax team .",
    "i am particularly grateful to the loc for the exquisite choice of restaurant for the social dinner .",
