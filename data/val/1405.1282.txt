    "while the standard model ( sm ) has been vindicated @xcite , no less by the recent discovery of the higgs boson @xcite , as the correct theory of elementary particles at the electroweak scale , there are reasons to suspect that it is at most an effective theory , to be superseded by a more complete theory at a higher energy scale .",
    "one of the reasons is the tiny but nonzero neutrino mass , unaccounted for in the sm , whose existence has been inferred from the solar , atmospheric , and reactor neutrino experiments confirming the idea of neutrino oscillation @xcite . the smallness of neutrino mass , and the apparent absence of right - handed neutrinos , associated with the fact that neutrinos , being charge - neutral , can very well be their own antiparticles , hints at the possibility that the neutrino mass terms might be purely majorana in nature .",
    "this in turn necessitates the presence of lepton number violating interactions , which are absent in the sm .",
    "another reason to believe in the incompleteness of the sm is the fine - tuning problem of the higgs boson mass @xcite . unlike the fermion and gauge boson mass terms",
    ", a scalar mass term does not spoil any symmetry of the action , so there is no reason why the quantum corrections to the mass would not drive it to the scale up to which the sm is valid . if the sm is valid all the way up to the planck scale @xmath9 gev , this brings in a very unnatural fine - tuning in the theory , and this is considered a sufficient motivation for physics beyond the sm ( bsm ) .",
    "while there are several options to avoid the fine - tuning problem , none of them are experimentally verified ; however , supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite remains the most preferred option .",
    "baryon number @xmath10 and lepton number @xmath11 are accidental symmetries of the sm and there is a priori no reason why the susy action would respect such symmetries .",
    "however , if both of them are violated , protons would decay uncomfortably fast . to prevent that , one imposes an ad hoc @xmath12 symmetry on the action , which is called the r - parity @xcite , defined as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spin of the particle , making @xmath15 for all particles ( superparticles or sparticles ) .",
    "this forbids both @xmath10 and @xmath11 violating interactions as well , and makes the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) stable , which can be a good cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate @xcite .",
    "this model is commonly known as the r - parity conserving ( rpc ) susy .",
    "the lightest neutralino ( @xmath16 ) , a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , is one of the most suitable cdm candidates .    on the other hand",
    ", one might allow either @xmath10 or @xmath11 ( but not both ) violating interactions , which will still forbid the rapid proton decay but violate r - parity .",
    "such r - parity violating ( rpv ) models @xcite are obtained by augmenting the rpc susy lagrangian by additional @xmath11 or @xmath10 violating terms .",
    "these terms lead to signatures that are drastically different from those of rpc susy .",
    "a typical example is the absence of large missing transverse energy ( ) signals , the hallmark of the rpc case , in the rpv models because of the unstable nature of the lsp ( this , at the same time , means that in the rpv models even a colored or charged sparticle can be the lsp ) .",
    "it turns out that @xmath11-violating rpv susy models can provide an excellent mechanism of generating majorana masses for neutrinos , various facets of which have already been discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "however , the neutrino masses depend not only on the rpv couplings but also on a number of parameters in the rpc sector , like gaugino and squark or slepton masses , and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath17",
    ". the constraints on these parameters and the smallness of the neutrino mass ensure that the required rpv couplings have to be quite small , typically @xmath18 or smaller for sparticle masses of @xmath19 gev @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , means that rpv channels are going to be interesting only for the lsp decay ; for all other cases ( there is one exception that we will discuss below ) , they are going to be swamped by rpc decays , cascading down to the lsp .",
    "as we have just mentioned , the lsp can be a charged or colored sparticle in the rpv models .",
    "however , a well - motivated choice is to have the lighter top squark ( also called the stop ) @xmath20 as the lsp .",
    "this can happen because of the large top quark mass which induces a significant mixing between the weak eigenstates of the stop , which in turn tends to make one of the mass eigenstates lighter .",
    "this supports the possibility of a @xmath20 lsp .",
    "it may also be the next - to - lightest sparticle ( nlsp ) , with @xmath21 being the lsp . in this paper",
    ", we will focus only on these two cases , namely , @xmath20 lsp , and @xmath20 nlsp .",
    "if @xmath20 be the lsp , it will decay through rpv channels with 100% branching ratio ( br ) in spite of tiny rpv couplings as required by the models of neutrino mass .",
    "it is well - known that a class of rpv couplings that may generate the observed patterns for neutrino mass splittings and mixing angles will result in the signal @xmath22 , where @xmath23 stands for any one of the three charged leptons in the sm .",
    "thus , the signal for the stop pair production and decay will be an opposite sign dilepton ( osdl ) pair , accompanied by two hard jets and negligible @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that it may be possible to observe the above rpv decays of the @xmath20 even if it is the nlsp while @xmath21 is the lsp . of course this can happen if some of the rpc decays of the @xmath20",
    "are either kinematically disallowed or dynamically suppressed .",
    "if the mass difference between @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a little more than 100 gev , such that the channel @xmath25 opens up , the brs for the rpv channels will go down drastically .",
    "thus we restrict ourselves to the parameter space with @xmath26 gev ( this automatically rules out @xmath27 ) . in this scenario the competing rpc channnels like the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) decay @xcite @xmath28 and the four - body decay @xcite @xmath29 are also suppressed .",
    "unlike the stop lsp case , the combined br of the rpv channels is not necessarily 100% ; it depends on the parameters of the rpv and rpc sectors .",
    "the competition between the rpv and rpc stop decay modes were studied @xcite in the context of a model of neutrino mass characterized by three bilinear @xmath0 and three trilinear @xmath3 rpv couplings ( @xmath30 being the lepton generation index ) , defined at the weak scale in a basis where the sneutrino vacuum expectation values ( vev ) are zero . it was found that the then neutrino data at the @xmath31 level could constrain the rpv parameter space pretty tightly ; on the average only 4 per @xmath32 models , characterized by these 6 rpv couplings , passed the neutrino data . in ref .",
    "@xcite the analysis was restricted to only a few benchmark scenarios for the rpc sector .",
    "it was further shown that the neutrino oscillation data induces a typical hierarchy among the three @xmath33 couplings @xcite .",
    "each set of rpv parameters consistent with the oscillation data is characterized by one of the six possible hierarchies , which is reflected in a similar hierarchy among the brs of the rpv stop decays into the three leptonic channels .",
    "thus a measurement of these brs in colliders will provide a strong hint about the underlying model of neutrino mass .",
    "the prospects of observing these decays at the tevatron @xcite and the lhc @xcite were estimated by two of us using pythia @xcite based analyses .    in view of the fact that the experiments at lhc operating at @xmath34 tev are round the corner , we update and upgrade the analysis of @xcite in the following ways . we use the latest neutrino data @xcite which have undergone a considerable change compared to the one used in ref .",
    "a striking example is @xmath2 , now definitely known to be nonzero , for which only an upper bound was used in ref .  @xcite . at @xmath35 level ,",
    "@xmath36 is now split into two allowed regions excluding the erstwhile canonical value of @xmath37 , and the spread is now significantly above or below @xmath37 .",
    "a fresh look at the allowed parameter space ( aps ) consisting of all combinations of the six rpv parameters consistent with the neutrino data and the corresponding lhc signals is , therefore , called for .",
    "we also systematically study the effect of variation of the rpc parameters on the aps and document the results , while only a few benchmark rpc points were considered in the earlier analysis , on which the rpv parameters were scanned to find the aps .",
    "last but not the least , now that the higgs boson mass has been measured , a large stop mixing parameter @xmath38 is mandatory unless one is ready to introduce superheavy squarks .",
    "this parameter augments the mixing between the stop weak eigenstates , making the light @xmath20 scenario even more appealing .    in the lhc related analysis",
    ", we consider much higher values of @xmath39 compared to ref .",
    "@xcite for obtaining a rough estimate of the mass reach . since neither @xmath40- nor @xmath41-tagging efficiency at lhc-14 tev is well documented as yet",
    ", we do not include them in our analysis . for signals involving",
    "@xmath41 there is an additional uncertainty ; a serious background may arise due to pure qcd processes where jets can be mistagged as @xmath41-jets .",
    "it is therefore better to wait for a data driven estimate of this background as and when it is available .",
    "we have thus restricted ourselves to final states only with @xmath42 and/or @xmath17 , and do not consider the @xmath40-tagging . as we shall see , even with this simple minded approach ( which can be further improved as and when the selection procedures and data driven background estimates from the lhc collaborations are available ) , a lot of parameter space can be covered .",
    "signals for stop decays mediated by the single coupling @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) have been explored by the cms collaboration @xcite .",
    "the bound does not depend on the exact values of the rpc or rpv couplings if @xmath20 is the lsp ; the br is always 100% .",
    "in this case the cms group found a lower limit of 453 gev on the mass of @xmath20 . in a model of @xmath45 mass",
    "leading to @xmath20 decays , one requires three nonzero @xmath3 couplings ; thus , the cms bound is valid only in the special case @xmath46 . for other hierarchies among the @xmath3s",
    "the above bound will get diluted .",
    "we have restricted ourselves , as just mentioned , to @xmath20 decays into final states with @xmath42 or @xmath17 .",
    "since the detection efficiencies of @xmath42 and @xmath17 are likely to be greater than that of @xmath41 , we work with the conservative bound @xmath47 500 gev .    the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly summarize the neutrino mass generation mechanisms through rpv interactions . the next section deals with the signals of @xmath20",
    "decays in the rpv channels mentioned above and the corresponding sm backgrounds following ref .  @xcite .",
    "we also estimate the minimum observable product branching ratio ( mopbr ) , to be defined in section iii , for these channels as a function of @xmath39 . in section",
    "iv we discuss our analysis , based on the random generation of @xmath48 rpv models for both stop lsp and stop nlsp cases , and filtering them through the latest neutrino data .",
    "we compute the product branching ratios ( pbr ) for the relevant rpv decays of @xmath20 in the models consistent with the data and check the observability of the resulting signals using the mopbrs derived in section iii .",
    "we also study the impact of variation of the important rpc parameters related to the neutrino mass matrix on the allowed solutions . in section",
    "v , we summarize and conclude .",
    "we consider a model with three bilinear r - parity violating ( rpv ) couplings @xmath0 and three trilinear couplings @xmath3 at the weak scale , so that the rpv part of the superpotential looks like _ rpv = _",
    "i l_i h_2 + _i33 l_i q_3 d^c_3 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the lepton , third - generation su(2 ) doublet quark , su(2 ) singlet bottom quark , and the second higgs doublet ( the one responsible for giving mass to the top quark ) superfields respectively , and @xmath53 is the generation index . all trilinear rpv couplings are taken to be real ; making them complex does not affect the result .    in general , two bases for the @xmath54 superfields",
    "are used in the literature @xcite .",
    "one is where all the neutral components , the higgs and the sneutrinos alike , get nonzero vev",
    ". one can also rotate the basis in such a way that the sneutrino vevs are zero in the new @xmath55 basis , but the fields here are combinations of fields of the first basis .",
    "we choose the basis where the sneutrino vevs are zero .",
    "it turns out that the rotation , which is a measure of the misalignment ( or the sneutrino component of the higgs ) , is extremely tiny , governed by @xmath56 . to satisfy the neutrino data",
    ", one needs @xmath57 gev , and if we take @xmath58 tev , @xmath59 ( see the end of section iv for a more quantitative estimate ) . as a result",
    ", we have retained this mixing where it is the dominant effect ( _ e.g. _ neutralino - neutrino mixing which directly contributes to the neutrino mass matrix ) but have neglected this where it induces a subdominant effect ( _ e.g. _ see the discussion on stop decay in section iv ) .",
    "the most general neutrino mass matrix can be found , _",
    "e.g. _ in @xcite . due to our choice of basis one may drop the terms containing the sneutrino vevs .",
    "possible additional contributions due to mixing between different fields are strongly suppressed due to mixing effects discussed in the last paragraph .    in principle",
    "the bilinear soft rpv terms @xmath60 may contribute to the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "however , in view of the fact that there are too many free parameters in rpv susy models , it is a standard practice to work with a minimal set of rpv parameters which can adequately describe a physical phenomenon ( neutrino mixing in the present case ) . in spirit",
    "it is like employing a ` simplified model ' in the context of rpv susy used by the lhc collaborations and also by a number of phenomenological analyses .",
    "following this practice we have assumed the @xmath60 s to be negligibly small .    using the above approximations",
    ", the neutrino mass matrix @xmath61 has contributions coming from both tree and loop level processes as listed below .",
    "bilinear rpv induces a mixing between neutrinos and neutralinos , and the tree - level neutrino mass matrix is m^tree_ij= _ i _ j c _ i_j .",
    "[ mtree - c ] here @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the @xmath64 and @xmath65 gaugino masses , @xmath17 is the higgsino mass parameter , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the usual ratio of the two higgs vevs .",
    "the flavor indices are denoted by @xmath68 . the first term in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ mtree - c ] ) is much smaller compared to the second if the lightest neutralinos are gaugino dominated ( @xmath69 ) , or @xmath70 . in either of these limits , we can write m^tree_ij= - -c .",
    "[ mtree - cpr ] this approximate formula is valid throughout this paper , governed by our choices of the susy parameters .",
    "note that @xmath71 is negative if the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ mtree - c ] ) is negative , and this statement is independent of the sign of @xmath17 in the limit for which eq .",
    "( [ mtree - cpr ] ) is valid .",
    "this mass matrix has obviously only one non - zero eigenvalue , and is therefore unable to explain the neutrino data , which needs at least two non - zero mass eigenvalues . with the introduction of the trilinear rpv couplings , a variety of other diagrams",
    "contribute to the neutralino - neutrino mass matrix at the one - loop level @xcite , and the new entries to the neutrino mass matrix look like m^_ij&= & _ k , l _ilk _jkl m_d_l m_d_k , + m^_ij&= & _",
    "kg_2 m_d_k .",
    "[ rpv - numass - loop ] here @xmath72 is the average down - type squark mass parameter , @xmath73 is the relevant trilinear coupling , and @xmath74 is the @xmath30-th generation down - type quark mass . note that eq .",
    "( [ rpv - numass - loop ] ) is a bit simplified expression , _",
    "e.g. _ we neglect the quark flavor mixing and approximate the squared mass difference of the two squark mass eigenstates by the product of their average mass and the corresponding quark mass . for simplicity ,",
    "we neglect the soft r - parity breaking bilinear @xmath60 terms and the corresponding entries to the neutrino mass matrix generated by them .    we will focus only on the cases where the lightest stop , @xmath20 , is the lsp ( or nlsp ) , and decays exclusively ( mostly ) through rpv channels , yielding a lepton in the final state .",
    "thus , one of the indices @xmath75 and @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ rpv - numass - loop ] ) must be 3 ; leading to three possible combinations : @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "we work in a framework where the first two generation squarks are taken to be much heavier than the third generation ones and therefore the matrix element has a suppression from the squark propagator if the combination @xmath77 or @xmath78 is chosen . moreover",
    ", for these two combinations the quark mass factors , coming from the mass insertion in the internal quark line and the mixing in the internal squark line , will also be smaller ( @xmath80 or @xmath81 ) compared to the choice @xmath79 , where the corresponding factor is @xmath82 . as a result",
    "much larger values of the rpv couplings compared to the @xmath83 case would be required to generate the same @xmath84 . however , the combinations like @xmath85 contributing to the diagonal elements of the mass matrix are severely restricted from tree - level @xmath86@xmath87 ( @xmath88@xmath89 ) mixing @xcite , the product being of the order of @xmath90 or smaller for 300 gev sleptons .",
    "this tension leads us to the last set , introducing three rpv couplings @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath43 in the model .-",
    "quark only , for which we take the mass to be @xmath93 gev . ]",
    "this removes the summation over the quark generation indices in eq .",
    "( [ rpv - numass - loop ] ) , and both @xmath94 and @xmath95 , now given by m^_ij&= & m_b^2 _i33 _j33 k _i33_j33 , + m^_ij&= & g_2 m_b , [ rpv - numass - loop2 ] become rank-1 matrices with only one non - zero eigenvalue .",
    "however , when we add all three terms , there are two nonzero eigenvalues ( as all the matrices are not diagonalizable by the same unitary transformation ) , the first one is at about the same place as that of the tree - level @xmath96 matrix , and another one which is much smaller than that .",
    "thus , the separation between them gives the atmospheric splitting , and the separation between the small nonzero eigenvalue and zero gives the solar splitting , leading to a normal hierarchy .    that the second eigenvalue is small can be ascribed to the choice of the parameters that one employs .",
    "however , there is a way to see that the normal hierarchy is more natural in this scenario .",
    "suppose the rpc and rpv parameters are such that @xmath94 gives a large eigenvalue , of the order of @xmath97 ev , and the contributions from the other two matrices , @xmath98 and @xmath95 are small . this will still give a normal hierarchy . only in the case of a nontrivial fine - tuning among all these parameters we expect an inverted hierarchy , two large eigenvalues that are almost degenerate . also , this has to pass the constraints on the neutrino mixing angles which is already quite precise .",
    "in fact , we did not get any solution that supports inverted hierarchy even if we play with all the susy parameters .",
    "in this section we study the prospect of detecting the rpv decays of @xmath20 at the upgraded lhc by a simple minded simulation following ref .",
    "our analysis , however , is extended to much larger values of @xmath39 .",
    "as already discussed we restrict ourselves to the rpv decays of @xmath20 through the couplings @xmath91 and @xmath92 only , focussing on electrons and muons in the final state and neglecting the @xmath41 leptons .",
    "the signal size is sensitive to @xmath99 , the product branching ratio ( pbr ) for the @xmath100-th channel , given by p_ij = br ( _ 1_i + b ) ( _ 1_j + b ) [ pij - def ] where @xmath101 for @xmath102 . note that we are considering the decay of the mass eigenstate @xmath20 , whereas the weak eigenstate @xmath103 takes part in rpv decays .",
    "thus , the amplitudes of @xmath20 decay depend on the stop mixing angle @xmath104 , defined as _ 1=",

    "2= -_l_t + _ r_t .",
    "[ theta - t - def ] however , if @xmath20 is the lsp , there is no rpc decay channel open for it , so the @xmath104 dependence cancels out in the brs and hence in the pbr .",

    "( [ rpv - numass - loop2 ] ) does not involve any further rpc parameters other than those already defined .    as said earlier ,",
    "we assume , in the entire analysis , ( i ) the first two squark generations to be much heavier than the third , and ( ii ) bino - dominated @xmath21 and wino - dominated @xmath158 .",
    "the numerical inputs are = 1.762  tev ,   = 10 ,   a_t = 3  tev ,   a_b = -5.5  tev ,   m_=2.5  tev ,   m_2-m_1 = 100  gev . apart from this ,",
    "we take @xmath159 gev for the stop lsp case , and @xmath160 and 75 gev for stop nlsp cases .",
    "while @xmath62 is more or less fixed by the @xmath21 mass , @xmath63 is kept close to @xmath62 so that @xmath153 in eq .",
    "( [ mtree - cpr ] ) is large , which , as we will show , is favored by the neutrino data .",
    "the stop decay width depends on the mixing angle @xmath104 defined in eq .",
    "( [ theta - t - def ] ) . this angle ( as well as @xmath39 )",
    "is computed from the @xmath161 stop mass matrix @xmath162 .",
    "we take the diagonal and off - diagonal entries of @xmath162 as free parameters .",
    "the off - diagonal entries are proportional to the stop mixing parameter @xmath163 ; this has to be large so that the mass of the lighter higgs scalar comes out to be in the range @xmath164 gev @xcite .",
    "this motivates the choice of @xmath165 .",
    "@xmath166 , which is the common mass parameter for l - type stop and sbottom squarks , is chosen to be large so that the average sbottom mass is 2.5 tev .",
    "thus the relatively small @xmath167 essentially determines @xmath39 , and this is the parameter that we tune to generate different @xmath39 . over the entire range of @xmath168 corresponding to observable signals , the allowed values of @xmath104 lie in a narrow range : @xmath169 , which is due to the higgs mass constraint .",
    "thus , @xmath20 is dominantly @xmath170 , but even the small @xmath103 component makes the rpv channels competitive to the rpc ones for stop nlsp case .",
    "the mixing angle is of no consequence for stop decays when @xmath20 is the lsp .    given the above rpc parameters the solutions consistent with the neutrino masses and mixing depend on the interplay of the three biliear rpv parameters @xmath0 and the three trilinear couplings @xmath3 .",
    "we randomly generate these parameters varying them over a wide range : _ i  gev ,   _i33 .",
    "the required parameters are directly read from the slha output file generated by suspect @xcite .",
    "we choose only those points that satisfy all the neutrino constraints and correctly reproduce the higgs mass @xmath171 in the allowed region .",
    "the generated mass squared differences and mixing angles must be consistent with the neutrino oscillation data @xcite . at @xmath35 level , this reads : & & m_21 ^ 2 = ( 7.45^+0.19_-0.16)10 ^ -5  ev^2 ,   m_31 ^ 2 = ( 2.4170.014)10 ^ -3  ev^2 , + & & ^2(_12 ) = 0.3060.012 ,   ^2(_23 ) = ( 0.4460.008 ) 0.593^+0.027_-0.043 , + & & ^2(_13 ) = 0.0231 0.0019 .",
    "[ nu - filter ] however , the precise determination of @xmath172 has severely constrained the parameter space for rpv models .",
    "the highly restrictive nature of the neutrino data can be understood from the fact that we hardly find any solutions from @xmath173 randomly generated points over the rpv parameter space as shown in eq .",
    "( [ nu - filter ] ) .",
    "therefore , we extend the range to @xmath174 level @xcite for further analysis : level . ] & & m_21 ^ 2 = [ 6.98:8.05]10 ^ -5  ev^2 ,   m_31 ^ 2 = [ 2.247:2.623]10 ^ -3  ev^2 , + & & ^2(_12 ) = [ 0.271:0.346 ] ,   ^2(_23 ) = [ 0.366:0.663 ] ,   ^2(_13 ) = [ 0.0173:0.0288 ] .",
    "[ nu - filter-3sigma ] the combinations of the rpv parameters which are filtered through the above data defines the aps and each member of this set is refered to as a solution .",
    "we also require that the sum of all the neutrino masses must also satisfy m _",
    "< 0.22  ev  at  95%  cl using the data from cosmic microwave background , the baryon acoustic oscillation , and the supernova luminosity distance from hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath3 , for every solution , show a hierarchical structure ; one or two of the couplings will be large compared to the other(s ) .",
    "this was also noted in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . obviously , the number of any particular type of lepton in the final state is directly proportional to the square of the rpv coupling .",
    "thus , all possible solutions can be divided into several groups , depending upon which lepton(s ) are going to be dominant .",
    "for example , if @xmath175 , we will expect only muon signals from such models .",
    "while there are nine possible leptonic combinations from the two stops , it reduces to only three for us ( @xmath6 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 ) as we do not simulate final states with @xmath41 , for reasons discussed before .",
    "let us also note here that the solutions are almost equally spread about @xmath178 .",
    "as we will show , for higher stop masses , some solutions are ` lost ' , _ i.e. _ the corresponding pbrs in all three dilepton channels ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath105 ) fall below the respective mopbrs",
    ". one might wonder whether @xmath41 detection might help , although this possibility can not be checked as yet for reasons already discussed .",
    "the pattern of the solutions , however , shows that for every stop mass ( both lsp and nlsp cases ) , at least 50% of the solutions have @xmath179 .",
    "thus a significant fraction of the so - called ` lost ' solutions may be observed through the @xmath41 channels .",
    "for example , with @xmath180 gev for the stop lsp case and an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath126 , 144 solutions are lost , out of which @xmath43 is largest for 112 solutions . for",
    "stop nlsp case , there are 188 ( 219 ) lost solutions with @xmath181 ( 900 ) gev and @xmath182 gev ; 111 ( 114 ) of them have @xmath43 as the largest coupling .",
    "of course , just the fact that @xmath43 is largest does not guarantee a detection through the @xmath41 channel .",
    "in this subsection we study the aps for models where @xmath20 is the lsp and decays entirely through the rpv channels . for our parameter choice",
    ", @xmath153 ( eq .  ( [ mtree - cpr ] ) ) is positive but @xmath157 ( eq .  ( [ rpv - numass - loop2 ] ) ) is negative ; for example , @xmath184 for @xmath185 gev . note that changing the sign of @xmath17 would flip the sign of @xmath157 but @xmath153 is independent of sgn(@xmath17 ) . later in the paper",
    ", we try to play with these constants , and it turns out that the above choice is close to the optimal one ; no matter how we change the coefficients , the number of models that pass the neutrino data filter never has a order - of - magnitude enhancement . in almost all the cases , it goes down , and sometime goes down rather drastically .",
    "only the rpv channels are open for @xmath20 decay , and for each solution the br of @xmath186 is simply proportional to @xmath187 .",
    "the brs are independent of @xmath168 and @xmath104 ; the dependence cancels out _ only _ for the stop lsp case .",
    ".distribution of signals for the various model solutions .",
    "column 2 shows the total number of solutions @xmath188 ; columns 3 - 5 show the solutions that result in an observable @xmath6 , @xmath176 , or @xmath177 signal ( pbr @xmath189 ) .",
    "the last column shows the number of ` lost ' solutions @xmath190 for which no signal can be observed .",
    "the numbers are for @xmath191 fb@xmath126 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     before we end , let us mention that the rotation from @xmath54 basis to @xmath55 basis can in principle induce charged lepton - chargino , and neutrino - neutralino mixing .",
    "they can affect the decays of the nlsp , @xmath20 , or the lsp , @xmath21 .",
    "for example the rpc vertex @xmath20@xmath40chargino may lead to additional lepton number violating couplings of the @xmath20 due to chargino - lepton mixings .",
    "similar induced couplings may arise from @xmath20@xmath192neutralino coupling due to mixing in the neutralino - neutrino sector ( these couplings may be relevant only if the @xmath20 is significantly heavier than the top quark ) .",
    "the mixing factors which would suppress the induced couplings can be estimated from the 5 @xmath193 5 ( 7 @xmath193 7 ) chargino - lepton ( neutralino - neutrino ) mass matrix .",
    "the estimated value is @xmath194 .",
    "since the largest @xmath0 allowed by the oscillation data is @xmath195 gev , the mixing factors are estimated to be @xmath196 or smaller . moreover ,",
    "the induced couplings will be additionally suppressed by gauge or yukawa couplings . on the other hand",
    "the smallest @xmath3 coupling contributing to @xmath20 decay consistent with the nuetrino oscillation data is @xmath197 .",
    "thus the @xmath20-nlsp brs computed by considering @xmath3 driven decays only are quite reliable .",
    "we now justify the above estimates by some numerical results , analogous to those obtained in @xcite .",
    "we numerically diagonalize the mass matrices in the chargino - lepton or the neutralino - neutrino sector for all combinations of rpv parameters allowed by the oscillation data .",
    "we find that the chargino - charged lepton mixing is always extremely tiny ; a typical amplitude for finding a charge lepton mass eigenstate in a chargino is @xmath198 .",
    "the corresponding @xmath91 , responsible for the @xmath20 or lsp decay signal , is @xmath199 . similarly the maximum amplitude for finding a neutrino mass eigenstate in any neutralino is @xmath200",
    "the corresponding @xmath91 is @xmath201 .",
    "the above results are for @xmath202 gev but this trend is seen over the entire range of parameters considered in this paper .",
    "in conclusion , we reiterate that the current neutrino data severely constrain the rpv generated neutrino mass models . in this paper , we have discussed a particular type of such models , where the neutrino mass matrix is generated by three bilinear and three trilinear @xmath203-type couplings . the severity of the constraint can be gauged from the fact that out of a billion randomly generated sets of the above six parameters , only a few hundred at the most are found to be consistent with the data .",
    "while the actual number of solutions depends on the rpc parameters , we have explicitly checked that our choice of those parameters is close to optimal .",
    "we have intentionally refrained from making an absolute optimal choice of the rpc parameters , just to keep our analysis on the conservative side .",
    "we have also kept our analysis on the conservative side , by considering only electrons and muons in the final state , and not employing @xmath40-tagging , as @xmath41- and @xmath40-tagging efficiencies at lhc-14 tev are not yet publicly available .",
    "even with such a conservative analysis , we get a lot of interesting conclusions .    the model considered in this paper",
    "may be tested through the rpv decays of the lighter stop squark , @xmath20 , provided it is the lsp or the nlsp .",
    "these scenarios with a relatively light @xmath20 are now well motivated since the mixing parameter @xmath38 in the stop sector is likely to be large in view of the measured value of @xmath204 126 gev , resulting in a rather light stop mass eigenstate . for a stop pair produced at lhc-14 tev",
    ", we consider their rpv decays into the channels @xmath205 jets .",
    "using pythia based simulations , we obtain model independent estimates of the minimum observable product branching ratios as a function of @xmath39 .",
    "in contrast to an earlier work by two of us , we show that a favourable signal may be obtained without @xmath40-tagging . following this procedure",
    "one can also reconstruct the mass of @xmath20 from the lepton - jet invariant mass distributions , which in turn reveals the lepton number violating nature of the underlying stop decays .",
    "we then consider the rpv models consistent with neutrino data and compute the product branching ratios for each of them .",
    "we find that for lower values of @xmath39 , signals from almost all the models are observable ; on the other hand , the fraction of observable models goes down with increasing @xmath39 , and for @xmath39 around 1 tev , no signal can be seen for any of the allowed models .",
    "we have checked that many of the lost solutions correspond to @xmath206 , especially for moderately heavy @xmath20 .",
    "once the techniques for handling @xmath41 rich final states at lhc-14 tev experiments and the corresponding background estimates are available , the inclusion of these states will improve the observability of neutrino mass models .",

    "<S> we consider a model of neutrino mass based on r - parity violating ( rpv ) supersymmetry , with three @xmath0 , relevant for bilinear rpv terms , and three @xmath1 , relevant for the trilinear terms . the present neutrino data , after a precise determination of the mixing angle @xmath2 , severely constrain such models . </S>",
    "<S> we make a thorough study of one such class of models that may have interesting signatures at the upgraded lhc . in this class of models , </S>",
    "<S> the relevant trilinear couplings are of the form @xmath3 , so if the lighter stop squark @xmath4 is the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , it will decay only through these couplings , giving rise to events with isolated hard leptons and jets . even when @xmath4 is the next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) , it can decay via the tiny @xmath5 couplings allowed by the neutrino data , although it may face stiff competition from some r - parity conserving decay modes . using a simple pythia based simulation , we find that in both the cases the signal consisting of a pair of oppositely charged leptons ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) plus jets may be observable at the upgraded lhc experiments for a reasonable range of the @xmath4 mass .    * lhc signatures of neutrino mass generation through r - parity violation *    roshni bose , amitava datta , anirban kundu + _ _ + sujoy poddar + _ _    pacs no . </S>",
