    "in this work we study the mixed formulation of poisson s equation with a multiscale diffusion coefficient , i.e.  where the diffusion coefficient is highly varying on a continuum of different scales . for such coefficients ,",
    "the solution is typically also highly varying and standard galerkin methods fail to converge to the correct solution , unless the features on the finest scale are resolved by the underlying computational mesh .",
    "a classical application is the flow in a porous medium , modeled by darcy s law . in this case , the multiscale coefficient describes a permeability field , which is heterogeneous , rapidly varying and has high contrast .",
    "classical discretizations that involve the full fine scale often lead to a vast number of degrees of freedom , which limits the performance and feasibility of corresponding computations . in this paper",
    ", we address this kind of problems in the context of mixed finite elements .",
    "we will interpret the mixed formulation of poisson s equation in a darcy flow setting , referring to the vector component as flux , and the scalar component as pressure . in darcy flow applications",
    "the flux solution is of particular interest since it tells us how a fluid is transported through the medium .",
    "it is desirable and common to use flux conservative discretization schemes .",
    "the proposed method is based on the raviart  thomas finite element @xcite which is locally flux conservative . concerning the mixed formulation of poisson s equation , corresponding multiscale methods were for instance proposed in @xcite .",
    "these methods are based on the raviart  thomas finite element and fit into the framework of the multiscale finite element method ( msfem , cf .",
    "another family of multiscale methods is derived from the framework of the variational multiscale method ( vms ) @xcite .",
    "multiscale methods for mixed finite elements based on vms are proposed and studied in @xcite .",
    "inspired by the results presented in @xcite , a new multiscale framework arose @xcite .",
    "we refer to this framework as localized orthogonal decomposition ( lod ) .",
    "it is based on the idea that a finite element space is decomposed into a low dimensional space that incorporates multiscale features and a high dimensional remainder space which is given as the kernel of an interpolation or quasi - interpolation operator .",
    "the multiscale space can be used for galerkin - approximations and allows for cheap computations .",
    "various realizations have been proposed so far . for corresponding formulations and rigorous convergence results for elliptic multiscale problems ,",
    "we refer to @xcite for galerkin finite element methods , to @xcite for discontinuous galerkin methods and to @xcite for galerkin partition of unity methods . among the various applications we refer to the realizations for eigenvalue problems @xcite , for semilinear equations @xcite , for the wave equation @xcite and for the helmholtz equation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a two level discretization of the mixed problem , that is we work with two meshes : a fine mesh ( mesh size @xmath0 ) which resolves all the fine scale features in the solution and a coarse mesh ( mesh size @xmath1 ) which is of computationally feasible size .",
    "this gives us a fine and a coarse raviart ",

    "thomas interpolation operator @xmath4 onto @xmath3 is the detail space @xmath5 .",
    "this space can be interpreted as all fine scale features that can not be captured in the coarse space @xmath3 .",
    "a low dimensional ideal multiscale space is constructed as the orthogonal complement to the divergence free fluxes in @xmath5 .",
    "we prove that this space has good approximation properties in the sense that the energy norm of the error converges with @xmath1 without pre - asymptotic effects due to the multiscale features .",
    "however , the basis functions of the ideal multiscale space have global support and are expensive to compute .",
    "we show exponential decay of these basis functions allowing them to be truncated to localized patches with a preserved order of accuracy for the convergence .",
    "the resulting space is called the localized multiscale space .",
    "the problems that are associated with the localized basis functions have a small number of degrees of freedom and can be solved in parallel with reduced computational cost and memory requirement .",
    "once computed , the low dimensional localized multiscale space can be reused in a nonlinear or time iterative scheme .",
    "we prove inf - sup stability and a priori error estimates ( of linear order in @xmath1 ) for both the ideal and the localized method .",
    "the local @xmath6-instability of the nodal raviart ",
    "thomas interpolation operator leads to instabilities as @xmath0 decreases for the localized method .",
    "we show that these instabilities can be compensated by increasing the patch size or using clment - type interpolators instead . in the numerical examples we verify that the localized method has the theoretically derived order of accuracy .",
    "we confirm our theoretical findings by performing experiments on the unit square and an l - shaped domain , as well as using a diffusion coefficient with high contrast noise and channel structures .",

    "the method proposed in @xcite is based on a fine and a coarse mesh with quadrilateral elements .",
    "the fine mesh is uniform @xmath508 , i.e.  aligned with the permeability data , and the coarse mesh is @xmath509 , so that each coarse element is subdivided into @xmath510 fine elements .",
    "the implementation of the method proposed in this work uses triangular meshes , which is why we divide each of the rectangular elements into two triangular elements by a diagonal line drawn from the upper left corner to the lower right corner .",
    "as coarse mesh , we use a similar triangular mesh that is constructed from a @xmath509 rectangular mesh such that the fine mesh is a conforming refinement of the coarse mesh .    the ( quasi - singular ) source data @xmath219 is equal to @xmath511 in the lower left and @xmath512 in the upper right fine quadrilateral element .",
