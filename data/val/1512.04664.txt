    "somewhat surprisingly an association with fast and narrow coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) has been reported in some @xmath0he - rich sep events @xcite .",

    "these are among the first @xmath0he - rich sep events detected after the unusually long solar minimum between solar cycles 23 and 24 ( the february 2 event is also identified in @xcite ) .",

    "an examination of sit mass histograms in the february 2 event confirms a clear @xmath0he peak within the helium range ( see figure  [ fig2]b ) .",
    "the january 26 event has a clear dispersive onset , where higher energy ions arrived earlier than lower energy ones as shown by the triangular pattern in the inverted ion - speed time spectrogram in figure  [ fig1]c .",

    "less clear is the ion release time in the february 2 event . the event ( from different ar ;",

    "the burst at 07:04  ut is also significant , extending to both high and low frequencies , and may be associated with an observed minor electron intensity increase .",
    "hereafter , we focus on the type iii burst at 11:42  ut because it was associated with the main electron event .",
    "the solar radio bursts report includes type iii at 17:03 on january 26 in frequency range 25 - 144  mhz ( sagamore hill ) and type iii at 07:04 on february 2 in 20 - 130  mhz ( culgoora ) .",

    "figure  [ fig2]a shows event averaged fluence spectra for january 26 and figure  [ fig2]b shows the spectra for the february 2 @xmath0he - rich sep event . the january 26 spectra for @xmath0he , @xmath2he , o , and fe have similar power laws .",
    "they are reminiscent of class-1 event spectra where major species exhibit similar power laws or broken power laws with @xmath0he often showing stronger hardening below @xmath61  mevnucleon@xmath5 @xcite . in the february 2 event ,",
    "@xmath2he and o have similar power laws but the @xmath0he and fe spectra are distinctly flatter , leading to a larger variation of @xmath0he/@xmath2he and fe / o with energy than in the january 26 event .",
    "the february 2 event spectra are similar to class-2 event spectra , characterized by curved @xmath0he and fe spectra towards low energies with @xmath0he rollovers in the range @xmath6100 - 600  kevnucleon@xmath5 and fe rollovers below @xmath6100  kevnucleon@xmath5 @xcite . certainly , the spectral shapes in these two events are not very representative of class-1 or class-2 events . there are fluctuations at several spectral points making it somewhat difficult to categorize the january 26 event solely by its @xmath0he shape .",
    "note , the median value of @xmath0he/@xmath2he ratio of class-1 events ( @xmath60.12 at 385  kevnucleon@xmath5 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is strikingly similar to @xmath0he/@xmath2he ratio in the january 26 event .",
    "during the investigated events the _ ace _ and _ stereo - a _ were angularly separated by 65  allowing the near - west limb regions from _ ace _ to be observed in a more direct view by _ stereo - a_. we emphasize that such a constellation enables a completely new insight on @xmath0he - rich sources , not available in earlier investigations .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ]  ( left ) shows the euv 195   image of ar 1042 near the central meridian in the _ stereo - a _ view . running difference images in figure  [ fig3 ]  ( right )",
    "show jet - like emissions at 17:00 - 17:05  ut in the eastern foot - point of a series of small magnetic loops .",
    "the observed temporal coincidence between the euv jet in ar 1042 and the type iii burst indicates that the ar contains open field allowing particles to escape .",
    "a large - scale wave was observed emanating from ar 1042 , the @xmath0he - rich sep source , as demonstrated in running difference images in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "the wave was clearly seen even in direct euv images ( see animation of figure  [ fig3 ]  ( left ) ) .",
    "the launch time of the wave temporally coincides with the euv jet .",
    "a bright wave front was clearly seen at 17:05  ut ( @xmath64 minutes after the x - ray flare and 2 minutes after the type iii ) but a weaker arc - shaped dimming , probably associated with the wave , was already seen at the type iii burst onset . the wave front propagated southward towards the equator and nominal spacecraft foot - point based on the parker spiral model .",
    "the nominal foot - point location was not reached before 17:15  ut , but the electron , and likely also the ion , release was associated with the jet , type iii burst and the wave - launch that occurred earlier . thus the wave could already intersect the open field lines connecting to the spacecraft at the time when it started .",
    "the nose of the wave front traveled 15  in latitude between 17:03 and 17:13  ut , which corresponds roughly to 300  kms@xmath5 .",
    "this is within the range ( 200 - 400  kms@xmath5 ) of typical euv wave speeds @xcite and is comparable with quiet - sun fast magnetosonic speeds .",
    "previous observations have shown that euv waves can be faster in the early stage and may even be shocks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . indeed ,",
    "newer high - cadence observations , capable of capturing the initial phases of the wave evolution , indicate much higher speeds ( @xmath6600  kms@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) implying that these waves may steepen to shocks quite frequently .",
    "euv wave shocks directly observed as dome - like enhancements propagating ahead of a cme have been reported in some recent investigations @xcite .",
    "the euv image of the sun s disk in figure  [ fig3 ] reveals quite uniform coronal structure with the only other ar located far away , near the south - east solar limb and a coronal hole at the south - pole .",
    "this likely enabled undisturbed wave propagation and therefore its easier observation .",
    "note that ars / coronal holes in the paths of the waves usually cause them to fade / reflect ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that ar 1042 is quite isolated with no simultaneous activity observed in other regions also allowed a more straightforward identification of the @xmath0he - rich sep source . note that many @xmath0he - rich sep events have been left without identified solar sources , for example , 40@xmath8 out of 117 events by @xcite .",
    "the driver of euv waves has often been associated with cmes but in this event there was no cme .",
    "any cme associated with january 26 event would be best visible in a coronograph from the earth view because of the source location near the western limb .",
    "the _ soho _",
    "lasco c2 observations , covering the range 1.5 - 6  @xmath3 , show a narrow stream at 17:54 , 18:06 and 18:30  ut at near - equatorial region on the west . in _ soho _",
    "lasco cme catalog this brief eruption was classified as a very poor event .",
    "no eruption was seen from 1.4 to 4 @xmath3 in _ stereo - a _",
    "cor-1 5-minute running difference images .",
    "also the _ stereo _ cor1 preliminary list indicates no associated cme .      figure  [ fig4 ]  ( left ) shows the _ stereo - a _ euv 195   image of the solar source ar for the february 2 @xmath0he - rich sep event , located at n20w65  from _ stereo - a _ , which was 65  west of the sun - earth line . running difference images in figure  [ fig4 ]  ( right )",
    "show a jet at 11:45  ut , temporally coincident with a type iii burst shown in figure  [ fig1]d .",
    "similar to the previous event , the jet was emitted from the sun s surface at the eastern foot - point of a series of small - scale loops .",
    "the ar emerged on 2010 january 30 when it was at the west limb as seen from the earth .",
    "the running difference images in figure  [ fig4 ] show a bright wave front emitted from the ar around the time of the jet and propagating in the south - east direction .",
    "the wave reached _ stereo - a _ nominal foot - point around 12  ut , but the electron ( and likely the ion also ) release occurred earlier at 11:45  ut in association with the jet and the type iii radio burst .",
    "the wave front in the february 2 event appears to be more diffuse ( cf . wave fronts 12 - 13  min after type iii burst onsets in both events at 17:15 and 11:55  ut ) and less bright than in the january 26 event ( cf .",
    "wave fronts 7 - 8  min after type iii burst onsets in both events at 17:10 and 11:50  ut ) .",
    "the projection effects in the february 2 event probably play a minor role as the wave propagates toward the central meridian where these effects are less dominant . because of the diffuse fronts in the february 2 event it is more difficult to measure the wave speed .",
    "a rough estimate is @xmath9200  kms@xmath5 between 11:45 and 12:00  ut where the wave front traveled 15  in the latitude . in direct euv images",
    "the wave was not so clearly seen ( see animation of figure  [ fig4 ]  ( left ) ) as in the previous event .",
    "note that in the february 2 event , _ stereo - a _ provides only 5 minute cadence images while in january 26 event the cadence is 2.5 minutes .",
    "thus , insufficient temporal resolution may be one reason why these waves were not noticed in earlier @xmath0he - rich seps investigations .",
    "the above mentioned projection effects due to western location of @xmath0he - rich sources may also add to the difficulty in an identification of the associated waves .",
    "the less intense type iii burst at 10:25  ut ( see figure  [ fig1]d ) was also associated with a jet and a coronal wave but these were less significant than in the 11:42  ut type iii burst .",
    "the type iii at 07:04  ut also coincided with euv brightening in the same ar but no wave was observed .",
    "the _ stereo - a _",
    "cor1 running difference images showed from 12:15  ut onward a small bright feature moving outward towards the west .",
    "this weak outflow was not marked in the cor-1 preliminary cme list .",
    "in addition to a visual inspection as given in the previous sections , we also provide a quantitative analysis of the wave fronts .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the evolution of the wave front profiles within 12 and 13 minutes after the associated type iii radio bursts in the january 26 and februay 2 events , respectively . a similar approach where the intensity ratios are derived along the propagating fronts is presented in earlier studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the figure reveals that the amplitudes of the intensity ratio and their temporal fluctuations are larger for the january 26 wave .",
    "the temporal behavior of the trailing front edges suggests that the january 26 wave was likely accelerating while the february 2 wave was moving with more uniform speed .",
    "these profiles also indicate lower speed for the february 2 wave .",
    "this paper examines a new solar phenomenon observed in association with @xmath0he - rich seps .",
    "we present two events , where in addition to euv jets , @xmath0he - rich source ars launched simultaneously a coronal euv wave .",
    "the waves were initiated by minor flares and not linked to cmes .",
    "the euv waves have been considered to be closely related with cmes @xcite , though recent investigations @xcite indicate that the association is not so strong .",
    "the euv waves may be a more common feature in @xmath0he - rich sep events than previously thought .",
    "@xcite have noticed large - scale disturbances in the source region of the stereo - b 2010 february 7 and ace february 8 @xmath0he - rich sep events . they have suggested that euv waves could be responsible for a sympathetic flaring in a region far from the nominal connection and thus contributing to a wide particle longitude distribution . in a parallel study ,",
    "@xcite have reported large scale propagating fronts in a few @xmath0he - rich sep events on ace by examining also active periods of a current solar cycle .",
    "note that some other @xmath0he - rich sep events like 2008 november 4 on ace @xcite or 2011 july 1 on stereo - b @xcite are also associated with euv waves ( not mentioned in original studies ) .",
    "their sources are well visible near the central meridian similarly to the 2010 january 26 event .",
    "coronal jets , a signature of magnetic reconnection between magnetic loops and overlying open field @xcite , create turbulence for @xmath0he - rich sep acceleration ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nearly all models of @xmath0he - rich seps require some kind of two - stage processes .",
    "for example electrons , accelerated by cascading turbulence , excite plasma waves @xcite capable of gyroresonant interaction with ambient @xmath0he @xcite .",
    "an alternative to turbulence is the reconnection - exhaust ion heating followed by an interaction with multiple magnetic islands ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the two spectral classes of @xmath0he - rich seps is a relatively new feature , and have not yet been adequately explained .",
    "it has been suggested that class-2 events represent the basic mechanism of @xmath0he enrichment and that class-1 events need a further stage of acceleration ( e.g. by a shock wave ) that may modify the spectra @xcite .",
    "a recent study by @xcite indicated a slight tendency for events with jets at their source to have class-2 spectra ( 9 of 13 ) , and those with euv waves at their source to have class-1 spectra ( 3 of 4 ) .",
    "the observation of euv waves , which may be shocks in their early phases , calls into question the details of @xmath0he - rich sep acceleration .",
    "the shape of the energy spectra observed in the first event , when the wave was bright , is similar to class-1 events . in this example",
    "the wave might have been capable of modifying the original curved spectra created by turbulence or by the pick - up mechanism in the reconnection exhausts .",
    "@xcite noted that euv waves with bright , sharp fronts may indicate shocks . in the second event , where the wave front was less bright and perhaps slower , the spectral forms were consistent with the class-2 events , suggesting that the influence of the wave was minor .",
    "the energy spectra of @xmath0he and @xmath2he in the february 2 event are quite similar to spectra in the class-2 event on 1999",
    "september 30 @xcite , which were excellently fitted by stochastic acceleration ( figure  9 in * ? ? ?",
    "we need to examine more events in order to evaluate the relevance of euv waves on the two class spectra of @xmath0he - rich seps .",
    "the two examples presented here also raise the question whether euv waves themselves ( even not steepened into the shocks ) may generate or enhance turbulence required for @xmath0he - rich sep acceleration models .",
