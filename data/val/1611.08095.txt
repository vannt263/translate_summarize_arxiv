    "metallicity distribution of stars in our galaxy has been used as an indicator for understanding its formation .",
    "the pioneer work related to the formation of our milky way galaxy is the one of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter els ) who argued that the galaxy collapsed in a free - fall time , i.e. 2@xmath1910@xmath20 gyr . however , this argument was in contradiction with the metallicity gradients observed at least in some of the components of the galaxy , which indicate a dissipative collapse in a much longer time - scale than the predicted one of els .",

    "a positive iron abundance gradient in the increasing vertical direction of the galactic halo is a typical feature for the mentioned mergers and accretions . despite these studies ,",
    "the researchers still investigate the formation -and evolution- of the galaxy by using the recent data , which are more accurate .",
    "metallicity of a star can be determined spectroscopically or photometrically .",
    "the first procedure requires high - resolution spectra , hence it can be applied only to nearby stars . while the second one is valid for distant stars as well .",
    "the invent of large telescopes which provide high resolution increased the accuracy of metallicity estimation .",
    "the distance to a star is important in the kinematical investigation of the galaxy .",
    "it can be estimated by using trigonometric or photometric parallaxes .",
    "the estimation of the trigonometric parallax of a star is limited with distance , i.e. it can be applied only to nearby stars . while , photometric parallax can be applied to distant stars as well .",
    "the main source for the trigonometric parallax is the _ hipparcos _ data @xcite .",
    "photometric parallax of a star can be provided by combination of its apparent and absolute magnitudes ( cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , estimation of the absolute magnitude of a star is another problem .",
    "the procedure usually used for its estimation is based on its offset from a standard sequence , such as the absolute magnitude - colour diagram of the hyades cluster .",
    "examples can be found in @xcite .",
    "the procedure of @xcite is different than the cited ones , i.e. they calibrated the [ fe / h ] to a third order polynomial in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and their combination . also , they calibrated the absolute magnitude @xmath23 instead of @xmath2 . additionally , the standard sequence used in their calibration consists of a theoretical third order polynomial of the colour @xmath24 .",

    "however , here we have a difficulty , i.e. the spaces occupied by stars observed with _ hipparcos _",

    "the solution of this problem is to transform the @xmath25 data of the sample stars in paper i to the @xmath1 data and adopt the same procedure for our purpose .",

    "hence , we restricted the faint limit of the de - reddened apparent magnitude with @xmath106 mag to avoid from large errors in magnitude and colours .",
    "thus , the median errors for @xmath29 , @xmath21 , and @xmath30 for the sample of dwarfs with @xmath107 ( @xmath108=27,304 ) are 0.03 , 0.04 and 0.11 mag , respectively .",

    "the distance error of a star is mainly comes from its apparent and absolute magnitudes .",

    "as stated in the previous paragraph , vertical metallicity gradients appeared in the literature are deep at small vertical distances , while they are less deep or flat at large @xmath10 distances .",
    "small @xmath10 distances cover the galactic region dominated by the thin - disc population , whereas thick - disc stars are significant at larger vertical distances .",
    "here , we showed that metallicity gradients are also absolute magnitude dependent .",
    "actually , the vertical distance intervals of the stars with the deepest metallicity gradients in different absolute magnitude intervals are different . in the following section , we will investigate the relation between our finding and the ones already appeared in the literature .",
    "we plotted the histogram for the stars with @xmath6 mag for interpretation of our results .",
    "14 shows that the distribution is bimodal , indicating two different star categories .",
    "actually , it could be dissolved into two different histograms with single modes by overlapping of the histograms for the stars with @xmath15 and @xmath13 mag on the same diagram .",
    "the mode for the bright absolute magnitudes correspond to @xmath121 mag , while for fainter ones it is at @xmath122 mag .",

    "for apparently bright stars in the panel ( a ) of fig .",
    "15 , the mode for the stars with absolute magnitudes @xmath13 almost kept its position in fig .",

    "contrary to the diagram in the panel ( a ) , bimodal structure for stars with @xmath6 mag in the panel ( b ) for apparently faint stars is more evident .",
    "one can observe a slight shift of the mode for stars with @xmath13 mag , relative to the one in fig .",
