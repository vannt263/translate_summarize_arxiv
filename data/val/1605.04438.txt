    "unilateral constraints , that is , constraints in the form of inequalities @xmath0 in generalized coordinates and velocities @xmath1 , are common in everyday life .",

    "such constraints are inconvenient in the framework of mechanics on smooth manifolds .",
    "when the unilateral constraints involve only @xmath2 s , as in contact mechanics , they can be accounted for as the effects of additional ad hoc sharply rising potentials , that is , in terms of mechanical deformations at the points of contact @xcite . in this paper , we instead look at the curvilinear polyhedra in suitable generalized coordinates that are carved out by the unilateral constraints .",
    "the behaviour of the mechanical systems plays out on these polyhedra .",

    "when a number of identical dumbbells are placed inside a tilted hollow cylindrical drum that rotates slowly around its axis , they climb upwards by forming dynamically stable pairs ( dyads ) , seemingly against the pull of gravity .",
    "it is a surprise when objects move in a direction opposite to the apparent force applied to them .",
    "it is even more surprising when such behaviour is displayed not by single objects , but only by pairs of objects which behave as a unit that is dynamically stable without any mutual attraction between the constituents . in this paper , we first identify a polyhedron in a certain manifold that naturally arises because of non - interpenetrability of the dumbbells , and then we show how energetics over the corners of this polyhedron can explain the observed behaviour of the dumbbells .",

    "the rollers occupy the region where @xmath52 is small with @xmath8 mostly positive , and the interlocked sliding structures are located at a higher value of @xmath8 ( see fig.[fig : bulk ] for a representative image of how the dumbbell distribution begins to appear very soon after the start ) .",
    "this behavior is similar to that for rolling spheres which was described in kumar .",
    "there are occasional slippages and collisions , and headings are observed to get randomized .",
    "this process keeps producing isolated dumbbells with a small positive heading .",
    "isolated rollers which have a small initial positive heading begin to move up the cylinder , till eventually their headings become nearly zero and they begin to slip downwards .",
    "this is as described in section 3.1 .",
    "3 .   during the above process ,",
    "descending dumbbells encounter newer isolated dumbbells going upwards , which occasionally results into the formation of a nested pair of dumbbells ( which we call as dyads ) .",
    "these dyads have two varieties , namely , right handed dyads and left - handed dyads ( see left panel of fig.[fig : dyads_confg_data_comb ] ) .",
    "the left and right handed dyads are mirror images of each other .",
    "occasionally one obtains a transient structure like the pair marked ( nc ) in fig.[fig : dyads_confg_data_comb ] ( left panel ) .",
    "this pair is not nested , and ( consequently ) it is observed to be unstable .",
    "it is not chiral , being its own mirror image .",
    "4 .   right handed dyads with a small arbitrary initial heading are observed to gradually change their heading to a particular value @xmath55 and then maintain that heading but for minor fluctuations ; see top panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : dyads](a ) and ( b ) .",

    "[ fig : dyads](c ) and ( d ) . for the example shown in fig.[fig : dyads_confg_data_comb ] , @xmath57 . for a fixed radius of the balls , the steady state heading @xmath58 of the dyad decreases with increasing dumbbell lengths @xmath4 ( see fig.[fig : length_sat ] ) .",
    "the qualitative features of the trajectories of a dyad are quite similar to those for a single dumbbell .",
    "when being carried up in @xmath8 by the rotation of the cylinder , the two dumbbells touch each other and the pair moves up as a composite object . as rolling is suppressed when objects are in contact , and as sliding friction is stronger than rolling friction , the maximum angle @xmath8 to which a dyad is carried up is greater that that for a single dumbbell .",
    "the experimentally observed values of this angle are given in the right half fig.[fig : s - curves ] of the appendix [ appn_friction ] .",
    "on reaching the maximum value of @xmath8 , the lower dumbbell in the pair breaks away from the top one by beginning to roll .",
    "it rolls down along a geodesic at an angle @xmath5 to the meridians , where @xmath5 is its heading .",
    "the higher dumbbell of the pair , whose heading is approximately the same as that of the lower dumbbell , then follows the lower one along a nearby geodesic , till it comes to a stop close to the first dumbbell , thus retaining the dyad structure ( [ fig : dyads_confg_data_comb ] ) . in this process",
    "the two dumbbells play the game of repeated rolling away and catching up .",
    "this behavior is similar to that for rolling spheres which was described in kumar .",
    "+ given the continuous closeness of the two dumbbells in a dyad observed above , it is useful to attach a single position as well as heading to a dyad as a whole .",
    "the position @xmath30 and the heading @xmath5 for a dyad will respectively mean the average of the positions and of the headings of the two dumbbells . note that the angle @xmath5 is well - defined only up to the addition of an integral multiple of @xmath43 .",
    "the right handed dyads move up in @xmath9 till they reach the top of the cylinder , and then they fall out .",
    "the left handed dyads go to the bottom of the cylinder , where they break apart . as described above in ( iii ) , new right handed dyads keep getting formed . our observations for our chosen experimental realization show that from a bunch of @xmath59 dumbbells that is initially placed in the bottom of the tilted rotating cylinder , about @xmath60 dumbbells exit the cylinder in 20 minutes , by forming right - handed dyads .    ) .",
    "the top and bottom panels respectively show the observations for right handed and a left handed dyad respectively .",
    "the observations deliberately begin which a right handed dyad with an initial _ negative _ heading and left handed dyad with an initial _ positive _ heading .",
    "it is to be noted how the headings of the right handed and left handed dumbbell dyads progressively become positive and negative respectively , and how the respective dyads eventually move in the @xmath9 or the @xmath61 directions .",

    "their corresponding variations in @xmath5 are plotted in ( b ) and ( d ) respectively .",
    "the data for any particular dyad is marked in a distinctive colour .",
    "for each chirality , one of the dyads has a positive initial heading and the other dyad has negative initial heading .",
    "the physical parameters for the dumbbells are @xmath62 . ]     as a function of @xmath4 for a right handed dyad are marked as red data points and for a left handed dyad as grey data points .",
    "the open symbols are the data obtained for a horizontal cylinder ( @xmath64 ) and the filled symbols correspond to the tilted cylinder ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the red curve is the graph of @xmath65 and the black curve is the graph of @xmath66 for a fixed value @xmath67 , which are the theoretical expected relations based on energy minimization derived in appendix [ appn_enrgy ] for ideal dumbbells with weightless rods in a horizontal cylinder . ]",
    "a dumbbell experiences a different amount of friction for motion along its axis ( sliding ) and perpendicular to its axis ( rolling ) , with the sliding friction being significantly higher than the rolling friction .",
    "this results in a ` keel effect ' in analogy with a boat in water that experiences very different resistances to moving forward as against sideways , while a raft  lacking a keel  does not show this behaviour .",
    "a detailed analysis of the frictional behaviour of a single dumbbell is given in appendix [ appn_friction ] , which includes the precise formulas as well as experimental observed values which validate the qualitative description given below .",
    "a dumbbell placed in a tilted rotating cylinder at @xmath36 with a small value of the heading @xmath5 will get carried upwards along @xmath8 by the rotation of the cylinder .",
    "thus , its underlying part of the cylinder keeps getting steeper .",
    "when @xmath8 exceeds a certain value , the force of gravity overcomes the resistance of static friction .",
    "consequently , the dumbbell begins to roll down along the geodesic with constant @xmath5 , till it reaches a lower value of @xmath8 where it comes to a stop .",
    "this process gets iterated , leading to a zigzag trajectory .",
    "such trajectories for positive and negative values of @xmath5 are shown in respectively blue and green in fig.[fig : coordinates ] , assuming that @xmath5 has remained constant .",
    "this auto toggling between stationary and rolling state allows a dumbbell with a small positive value of the heading @xmath5 to move up the energy ladder in a sustained manner , provided it maintains a constant positive heading .",
    "however , the value of @xmath5 is not stable , and tends to zero as time passes for reasons of energetics that we now explain .",
    "( the torque on a dumbbell , which leads to this change of heading , is discussed in appendix [ appn_friction ] . )    for this , it is convenient to regard a cylinder tilted at an angle @xmath13 as a cylinder which is kept horizontal , in which an object of mass @xmath68 placed on the surface is subjected to a body force in the direction @xmath61 of magnitude @xmath69 .",
    "a single dumbbell lying on the cylinder defines a point of the the space @xmath70 which has coordinates @xmath71 where @xmath30 describe the location of the center of mass of the dumbbell on the surface of the cylinder , and @xmath5 is a circular coordinate with period @xmath43 which describes the angle from a meridian line ( @xmath72 ) to the axis of the dumbbell .",
    "geometrically , @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 denotes a circle of circumference @xmath43 ) is the space of _ apparent configurations _ of a single dumbbell .",
    "this is a manifold of dimension three .",
    "a dumbbell placed in a horizontal cylinder has a unique minimum potential energy , which is achieved for @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( while @xmath9 may be arbitrary ) .",
    "the subset @xmath77 of @xmath70 defined by the simultaneous equalities @xmath75 and @xmath76 is an attractive minimum locus .",
    "thus , slippages brought by noise lead to any dumbbell placed arbitrarily to move towards @xmath77 . when the heading @xmath5 is zero",
    ", the dumbbell rolls in place .",
    "now suppose that we apply a body force which corresponds to a small value of @xmath13 . for a dumbbell with a small enough initial value of @xmath50 ,",
    "the effect of the body force does not interfere with this behaviour ( where @xmath5 gradually becomes @xmath78 ) , but it tends to lower @xmath9 because of occasional slippages . if @xmath50 is large , then the body force makes the dumbbell roll in a direction which lowers @xmath9 .",
    "this explains the observed behaviour described above .",
    "as seen above , a single dumbbell lying on the cylinder defines a point of the space @xmath73 of dimension three .",
    "a similar geometric description for a pair of dumbbells begins with a point of the product space @xmath80 , with coordinates @xmath81 that describe the two dumbbells . however , not all points of @xmath80 are accessible , as the dumbbells can not mutually interpenetrate .",
    "this results in unilateral constraints , which carve out a subspace @xmath82 in @xmath80 as the actual configuration space for a pair .",
    "it turns out that @xmath79 is not a manifold , but it is locally a polyhedron in curvilinear coordinates , having boundaries and corners .",
    "we now physically describe this curvilinear polyhedron in terms of the relative placement of the two dumbbells .",
    "we will also physically describe the corners of @xmath79 and their interconnects in terms of allowed relative movements of the dumbbells .",
    "some of the basics of curvilinear polyhedra in manifolds are recalled in appendix [ appn_polyhedron ] . in this section , we describe the relevant geometry physically .    for simplicity , we will assume that the rods of the dumbbells are long enough so that a single ball of one dumbbell can not simultaneously touch both the balls of the other dumbbell .",
    "the set @xmath79 is six dimensional , and it is naturally partitioned into subsets @xmath83 for @xmath84 which have direct physical descriptions ( see fig.[fig : geometry_of_dyads ] ) .",
    "a dummbell pair where the dumbbells are not touching each other defines a point of @xmath85 .",
    "if the pair has a one point contact then the corresponding point of @xmath80 is in @xmath86 and for a two point contact the corresponding point is in @xmath87 .",
    "points of @xmath88 represent dumbbell pairs with at least three points of contact . as will be apparent , the sets @xmath83 have dimension @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",

    "if we have a pair of dumbbells which do not touch , then if each dumbbell is independepently perturbed by small enough amount , then they continue not to touch .",
    "this shows that @xmath85 is an open set , and so it has dimension @xmath95 . a pair which corresponds to a point of the set @xmath96 has two kinds of realizations depending on whether the single contact point of the two dumbbells lies on a ball of each dumbbell , or lies on the ball of one dumbbell and the rod of the other dumbbell ( see fig.[fig : geometry_of_dyads ] ) . in a small neighbourhood in @xmath80",

[ fig : geometry_of_dyads ] and its mirror image .",
    "one may say in general that a dyad is a point in @xmath80 which is in a small neighbourhood of @xmath160 with respect to the natural metric on @xmath80 induced from that on @xmath70 .",
    "one possible choice of such a neighborhood ( for the sake of definiteness ) is the open subset @xmath162 defined by the inequalities @xmath163 every dumbbell pair inside this neighbourhood has a chirality .",
    "more generally , keeping the width of the neighbourhood small ensures that the pair of dumbbells remains nested , and so it has a chirality .",
    "we have already explained that @xmath142 and @xmath146 are loci of local minima for energy .",
    "inspection shows that for any point of @xmath79 outside @xmath164 , there exists a nearby point in @xmath79 where the total energy is lower .",
    "this shows that the subset @xmath164 is the entire set of all points of local minima for the total energy function on @xmath80 for a pair of dumbbells in a horizontal cylinder .",
    "we will now consider the case of a rotating horizontal cylinder .",
    "the following discussion applies when the level of noise as well as the angular speed of rotation are both sufficiently small . in such a cylinder ,",
    "energy minimization takes the point representing a dumbbell pair to either a small neighborhood of @xmath146 or to a small neighborhood of @xmath142 .",
    "representative configurations of the dumbbell pairs close to @xmath150 ( in blue ) and @xmath151 ( in green ) are shown in the left panel of fig.[fig : nested_2 ] .",
    "if the point representing the pair is close to @xmath150 ( respectively to @xmath151 ) , then in physical terms , the dumbbell pair is a left handed ( respectively right handed ) dyad with a small negative ( respectively positive ) heading , of the order of @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , its subsequent motion is a zigzag as explained in 3.2.(v ) above . on the other hand , if the point representing the pair is close to @xmath142 , then both the dumbbells roll in place , and the point representing the pair roughly remains stationary in @xmath80 .      as before",
    ", we can view a tilted cylinder as a horizontal cylinder together with a sideways body force field @xmath166 acting in the direction @xmath61 .",
    "this body force causes occasional slippages of the pair in the @xmath61 direction , both in the case of pairs moving on zigzag path or pairs rolling in place .",
    "the effect of these slippages in terms of movement in the @xmath61 direction is not too large if the body force is not too large .",
    "the body force causes a change of heading for pairs in @xmath146 , which again is small when @xmath166 is small .",
    "in fact , this change of heading is negligible for the actual experimental parameters ( see fig.[fig : length_sat ] ) .",
    "hence the headings remain non - zero positive ( or negative ) , close to @xmath167 with small fluctuations . hence a pair in @xmath142 , which would have essentially rolled in place in the absence of a body force , now moves via slippages in the @xmath61 direction , eventually reaching the bottom .",
    "a pair near @xmath150 would have moved in a zigzag path reducing @xmath9 in the absence of a body force .",
    "this movement tin the @xmath61 direction is enhanced by the slippages , and such a pair also goes to the bottom of the cylinder .",
    "the case of interest are pairs which define a point close to @xmath151 .",
    "such a pair would have moved in a zigzag path increasing @xmath9 in the absence of a body force .",
    "if the noise and the body force are not too large , this zigzag motion which increases the value of @xmath9 is not entirely negated by the occasional slippages in the @xmath61 direction .",
    "hence such a pair goes to the top of the cylinder .",
    "it should be noted that after the value of @xmath5 for a right handed dyad arrives close to @xmath58 , the variation in @xmath8 during its subsequent zigzag trajectory is about @xmath168 , and @xmath5 continues to remain within @xmath169 .",
    "this means that the dyad stays close to @xmath151 during its zigzag trajectory , which re - enforces the stability of the heading and of the dyad formation .",
    "the zigzag trajectory moves upwards along @xmath9 , which parameterizes the half - line @xmath151 , and the arms of the zigzag do not extend very far from the attractive set @xmath151 for the energy function @xmath138 on @xmath79 .",
    "we now continue with a tilted rotating cylinder , again assuming that the noise and the tilt are not too large . up to now",
    ", we have analysed the motion of either a single dumbbell or the motion of a pair of dumbbells placed in the cylinder .",
    "let us now consider the general case where a number of dumbbells are placed in the cylinder .",
    "an individual dumbbell with positive slope in the appropriate range will rise in @xmath9 by a zigzag path as explained earlier .",
    "but eventually , such the heading of such a dumbbell goes to zero , and the dumbbell starts coming downwards .",
    "this descending dumbbell may encounter another dumbbell which is rising , and these two dumbbells may collide to become approximately parallel , and come to define a point of @xmath80 which is in the attractive basin around the local minimum set @xmath146 .",
    "this results in the formation of dyads .",
    "when a left handed pair reaches the bottom , it breaks apart .",
    "these get added to the dumbbells at the bottom , along with single dumbbells which come all the way down .",
    "such dumbbells may become a part of new right handed dyads by the process described above .",
    "this is how ever new right handed dyads keep getting formed .",
    "such a dyad , unless it gets obstructed by other dumbbells , rises to the top of the cylinder and falls off .",
    "an interesting outcome of the dependence of the direction of motion on the chirality of a dyad is that it leads a sorting of dyads by their chirality .",
    "it is noteworthy that the underlying mechanism for this sorting is achiral in a strong sense , more precisely , a rotating horizontal cylinder which is infinite in both directions is a rigid body with an achiral motion .",
    "de gennes has given another instance of an achiral mechanism for sorting ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such achiral mechanisms may be contrasted with the more common ` hand - in - glove ' approach to sorting of chiral objects , which relies on a chiral environment ( such as parallel electric and magnetic fields as first proposed by p. curie @xcite ) , or on the initial provision of a model chiral object as a template for sorting .",
    "we have seen by a detailed analysis of dumbbells placed in a tilted rotating cylinder how the major qualitative aspects of the behaviour are explained in terms of an underlying polyhedral geometry .",
    "this included the formation and stability of dyads of two chiralities , and their sustained locomotion .    the unilateral constraints which gave rise to the polyhedron @xmath79 arose from the mutual non - interpenetrability of dumbbells .",
    "these constraints were expressible by inequalities which take the form @xmath170 in terms of the generalized position coordinates @xmath171 of the dumbbells .",
    "more generally , there can exist physical situations ( e.g. location dependent speed limits in traffic rules ) where the unilateral constraints involve generalized velocities and take the form @xmath172 . under appropriate assumptions",
    ", these will carve out polyhedra in phase spaces of the physical systems .",
    "again , interesting physics can be expected to take place in a neighbourhood of the corners of these polyhedra .",
    "one should note that the polyhedron @xmath79 in this paper was locally convex in a curvilinear sense .",
    "such locally convex corners can lead to entrapment via an optimization mechanism explained in appendix [ appn_enrgy ] or via its suitable generalizations to more general types of corners .",
    "other physical systems lead to polyhedra which may not be locally convex , and which may in fact admit ` locally concave ' corners , which result in bifurcations in the systemic evolution .",
    "a simple example of this phenomenon , which involves both locally convex and locally concave corners , leading to entrapments and bifurcations , is given by the geometry and energetics of a pinball ( bagatell ) machine .",
    "for simplicity , we have only considered the differential category so far . but given that many physical systems correspond to spaces defined by algebraic equations , one should expect that ` semi - algebraic sets ' ( loci defined by inequalities involving algebraic functions on varieties ) occur in place of curvilinear polyhedra , allowing more general singularities than corners ( e.g. , cusps ) to occur .",
    "the prevalence of the english expressions ` to corner ' and ` to drive a wedge ' for describing the processes of entrapment or bifurcation is actually a recognition of the role of polyhedra and their corners which underlie diverse phenomena .",
    "given the ubiquity of unilateral constraints ( e.g. , steric hinderence in molecules @xcite ) and also of entrapments ( e.g. , folded states of proteins @xcite ) and bifurcations in the physical world , we expect that it is worth looking for explanations of such phenomena based on curvilinear polyhedra in configuration or phase spaces , and dynamics near their corners .",

    "the outside of the hatched region is the subset of the points in @xmath173 where the net torque tends to decrease @xmath50 . inside the hatched region",

    "the frictional resistance to the onset of motion of a stationary dumbbell lying on a stationary substrate is captured by two dimensionless constants which we denote by @xmath177 and @xmath178 , where @xmath179 .",

    "if a dumbbell lying stationary on a surface is subjected to a force @xmath180 normal to the surface and a force @xmath181 tangent to the surface in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the dumbbell , then it starts moving ( which will be mainly by rolling ) provided @xmath182 . here it is assumed that the left hand side is only slightly larger than the right hand side . instead of the force @xmath181 ,",
    "if a force @xmath183 along the axis of the dumbbell is applied , then the dumbbell starts moving ( which will be by sliding ) provided @xmath184 . in general ,",
    "empirical observation shows the following ( which is an idealized description that ignores mechanical noise and the statistical irregularities of the surfaces ) .",
    "let a force @xmath185 tangent to the surface be applied to the dumbbell , making an angle @xmath186 with the perpendicular direction to the dumbbell ( its direction of rolling ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath187 where @xmath188 under the application of such a force , the dumbbell begins to move ( mainly by rolling ) if @xmath189 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath190 , then the dumbbell begins to move ( by a mixture of sliding and rolling ) if @xmath191 .",
    "measurement shows that we have the values @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 for the dumbbells and the substrate ( the glass cylinder ) used in our experiment .    in the above described case , where @xmath187 and @xmath189 , observation shows that when a dumbbell begins to move , it moves by rolling along a geodesic trajectory on the surface which is perpendicular to the axis of the dumbbell , modulo fluctuations brought about by mechanical noise and the statistical irregularities of the surfaces .",
    "here we have assumed that the reciprocal of the mean curvature of the surface is everywhere significantly greater than the length of the dumbbell .",
    "a dumbbell moving slowly on a stationary substrate can be brought to a halt by frictional forces .",
    "this phenomena of the cessation of motion is controlled by analogous coefficients @xmath195 and @xmath196 of friction in motion .",
    "these coefficients are considerably smaller than the corresponding coefficients @xmath178 and @xmath177 which control the onset of motion .",
    "consequently , the frictional resistance offered by the surface to a dumbbell decreases as soon as it starts to roll .",
    "if we ignore the effects of inertia , then the condition for a rolling dumbbell to come to a halt is @xmath197 in terms of the notation used above .",
    "we now apply the above equations to determine when a stationary dumbbell starts rolling , and when a rolling dumbbell comes to a halt , in our experimental setup . here",
    ", the dumbbell is placed on the inside surface of a cylinder as described earlier , and is subjected only to gravitational and frictional forces . from the frictional properties of a dumbbell , described above , we can determine its trajectory .",
    "of course , this is an idealization which ignores the effect of noise and random slippages .",
    "our experimental parameters satisfy the following inequalities @xmath198 physically , the inequalities @xmath199 and @xmath200 mean that dynamic friction is smaller than the corresponding kind of static friction . the inequalities @xmath201 and",
    "@xmath202 mean that rolling is easier than sliding .",

    "it is an empirical fact that both the inequalities @xmath203 and @xmath205 can be simultaneously satisfied when @xmath13 lies in a certain nonempty interval .",
    "let @xmath206 be the angle so defined that if any object made of the same material as the dumbbell is placed at a point @xmath207 on the cylinder , with @xmath208 , then the object begins to move .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath209 the downward pointing unit vector field @xmath210 in the laboratory , when restricted to the surface of the cylinder , has an orthogonal decomposition @xmath211 with @xmath33 tangent and @xmath212 normal to the surface .",
    "recall that @xmath33 is given by eqn.([eqn : tangent_force ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath212 has the magnitude @xmath213 as the gravitational force on a dumbbell is given by @xmath214 , we get @xmath215 and @xmath216 in terms of the vector fields @xmath33 and @xmath212 , and so @xmath217 if a dumbbell located at @xmath30 has heading @xmath5 , then the unit tangent vector @xmath218 to the surface at @xmath30 which makes an angle @xmath219 with the axial vector @xmath220 is given by @xmath221 hence the angle @xmath186 between @xmath33 and the perpendicular @xmath218 to the dumbbell is given by @xmath222 consider the manifold @xmath223 with a projection map @xmath224 which sends a point @xmath225 to the point @xmath226 .",

    "energy minimization thus affects @xmath5 , taking it towards @xmath247 , which means there is torque which reduces @xmath50 to @xmath78 .",
    "this torque originates from the finite length of the dumbbells , because of which the lower ball of the dumbbell ( where @xmath52 is smaller ) experiences a higher reactive force from the cylinder as the slope of the cylinder goes to @xmath78 with @xmath52 .",
    "hence the two balls experience different forces , including different tangential and normal forces , and so also a different frictional resistance to motion .",
    "the torque is zero also when @xmath248 , which however is a repulsive fixed set .    when a cylinder is tilted , the values of the forces change , and so the above torque changes .",
    "however , when @xmath249 , for small values of @xmath50 the effect of the tilting on the torque is small , not changing the qualitative conclusion that @xmath50 will tend to @xmath78 for an isolated dumbbell . if @xmath50 is large , the torque tends to increase @xmath50 towards @xmath250 ( see fig.[fig : s_curve_torque ] ) . in any case , a dumbbell with @xmath50 large rolls down rapidly to the bottom of the tilted cylinder .",

    "a _ locally curvilinear polyhedron _ @xmath79 in @xmath270 ( a ` polyhedron ' for short ) is any closed subset @xmath79 of @xmath270 which satisfies the following condition : the manifold @xmath270 should admit an open cover by subsets @xmath272 together with diffeomorphisms @xmath273 where @xmath274 is an open set in @xmath263 , and for each @xmath275 a polyhedron @xmath276 such that @xmath277 . if we can so choose the data that each @xmath278 is a convex linear polyhedron in @xmath263 , then we will say that @xmath79 is a _ locally convex curvilinear polyhedron _ in the manifold @xmath270 .",
    "it should be noted that the manifold @xmath270 is not assumed to be riemannian , and the word ` convex ' comes from the local diffeomeorphism with @xmath279 , and not from any notion of convexity based on geodesics .",
    "any polyhedron @xmath280 is a disjoint union of subsets @xmath281 where @xmath282 is the set of all its vertices , @xmath283 is the union of its edges , etc . in particular , @xmath284 is the interior of @xmath285 .",
    "this allows us to decompose a polyhedron @xmath286 similarly as a disjoint union @xmath287 in a well - defined manner , independent of the choice of the local diffeomerphisms @xmath288 .",
    "note that the boundary of @xmath289 is contained in the union of the lower @xmath83 , in fact , @xmath290 when @xmath79 is connected .",
    "it follows from the definition that each @xmath289 , if non - empty , is a locally closed submanifold of @xmath270 of dimension @xmath103 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath103 is the smallest integer such that @xmath289 is not empty , then @xmath289 is closed in @xmath270 . at the other end ,",
    "the stratum @xmath291 is open in @xmath270 , being the interior of @xmath79 .",
    "of course , @xmath291 can be empty .",
    "the _ dimension _ of @xmath79 is equal to the largest @xmath103 for which @xmath289 is nonempty .",
    "the figure fig.[fig : tutorial_polyhedral ] shows an example of a @xmath137-dimensional curvilinear polyhedron in the @xmath137-dimensional ambient manifold @xmath292 .",
    "the main example of a locally convex curvilinear polyhedron for us is the configuration space @xmath293 for a pair of dumbbells in a cylinder that we have physically described in section 5 above .",
    "we assume that the cylinder is kept horizontal .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the resulting gravitational potential function on @xmath80 which is the sum of the potential energies of the individual dumbbells .",
    "we now consider the problem of finding the loci of local minima for the restriction @xmath294 of @xmath138 to @xmath79 . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that the rod of the dumbbell is weightless .",
    "if the rods have a weight , the value of @xmath58 will go up . for our experimental parameters ,",
    "the effect of the weight of the rods is negligible : see fig.[fig : length_sat ] . as a local minimal point for @xmath294 may lie on the boundary of @xmath79 , where @xmath79 is not a manifold locally , the usual calculus method of finding stationary points via vanishing of the first derivative needs to be replaced by more general statements .",
    "if a polyhedron @xmath295 is locally a quadrant around a minimal point , that is , if @xmath79 can be locally defined by inequalities @xmath296 for @xmath297 for some @xmath298 where @xmath299 are local coordinates centered at a minimal point , then we can apply the following minimization lemma .",
    "it turns out that this is enough for our purpose , because @xmath293 is indeed locally a quadrant around the corner @xmath115 as we see later .",
    "* lemma * _ let @xmath300 .",
    "let @xmath301 be any subset such that the origin @xmath78 lies in @xmath302 and such that for any @xmath303 the condition @xmath304 is satisfied for all @xmath305 .",
    "let @xmath306 be a smooth function in a neighbourhood of @xmath78 in @xmath263 , which satisfies the following properties .",
    "+ ( 1 ) @xmath307 for @xmath308 . + ( 2 ) @xmath309 for @xmath310 .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the @xmath311 hessian matrix @xmath312 $ ] , where @xmath313 $ ] , is positive definite . + ( 4 )",
    "@xmath306 is independent of the remaining @xmath103 variables @xmath314 .",
    "+ then the point @xmath315 is a point of local minimum for the restriction @xmath316 of @xmath306 to @xmath302 .",
    "moreover , the set @xmath317 , where @xmath318 is defined by the equations @xmath319 , is a locus of local minimum for @xmath320 in a neighbourhood of @xmath78 .",
    "_        we will apply the above by taking @xmath302 to be the portion of a polyhedron @xmath79 in a neighbourhood of the origin @xmath78 , such that each @xmath299 is non - negative on @xmath79 for @xmath321 .",
    "it is significant that the above conditions for minimization of @xmath322 allow some of the first derivatives ( namely , @xmath323 for @xmath297 ) to be positive .",
    "this is in contrast to the minimization condition for @xmath306 on a manifold @xmath270 , where _ all _",
    "first derivatives need to be zero .",
    "this non - vanishing of @xmath323 means that the force field @xmath324 is _ non - zero _ at a point @xmath325 , and so reinforces the entrapment of the system in the corner .",
    "in contrast , at the usual kind of minimization on manifolds , the first derivative is zero and second derivative is positive , and so @xmath326 is zero at the point itself , so the entrapment is much weaker .",
    "these considerations lead to a qualitative description of any higher dimensional entrapment as a combination of three kinds of basic one - dimensional entrapments , each of which is stronger than its predecessor , which are as follows : see fig.[fig : entrapment ] for a pictorial description .",
    "\\(1 ) _ harmonic localization ( ` u ' type entrapment ) . _",
    "this results when the configuration space is one dimensional , and contains an open interval @xmath327 around @xmath328 .",
    "suppose the leading term of the potential energy is @xmath329 .",
    "then the system admits a bound state around @xmath328 .",
    "\\(2 ) _ half - harmonic ( ` half - u ' ) entrapment . _",
    "this refers to a one dimensional polyhedron which is locally a neighbourhood of @xmath78 in the positive half line @xmath330 .",
    "again let the leading term of the potential energy be @xmath329 .",
    "let the boundary at @xmath328 be an energy absorbing boundary . due to repeated losses of energy at @xmath328",
    "the system gets entrapped near the boundary .",
    "\\(3 ) _ triangular ( ` half - v ' ) entrapment .",
    "_ this again refers to a one dimensional polyhedron which is locally a neighbourhood of @xmath78 in the positive half line @xmath330 . but",
    "this time , let the leading term of the potential energy be @xmath331 . once again , let the boundary at @xmath328 be an energy absorbing boundary . due to repeated losses of energy at @xmath328",
    "the system gets entrapped near the boundary .",
    "this entrapment is further strengthened by the fact that the force ( which equals minus the gradient of the energy ) is non - zero at @xmath328 .",
    "consequently , the system is rapidly driven into the ` corner ' point @xmath328 , and is held there with a non - zero force .",
    "we now apply the above lemma to our case of dumbbell pairs , to establish the following : [ prop : local minima ] the sets @xmath150 and @xmath151 in @xmath80 are sets of local minima for the energy function @xmath294 .    to put this in the notation of the lemma , consider the following local coordinates @xmath332 on @xmath80 in a neighbourhood of a point of @xmath150 or @xmath151 .",
    "let @xmath333 where @xmath8 , @xmath5 and @xmath9 the average coordinates for the pair . in the equation for @xmath334 ,",
    "the minus sign is for @xmath150 and the plus sign is for @xmath151 .",
    "then a straightforward calculation shows that the conditions in the statement of the above lemma are satisfied at @xmath335 with @xmath336 , @xmath337 , @xmath338 and @xmath339 . as explained earlier , the subset @xmath340 is indeed given in a neighbourhood of a point of @xmath150 or @xmath151 by the inequalities @xmath304 for @xmath341 .",
    "hence the lemma applies to give our desired conclusion .",
    "in fact , we now see that the entrapment in the @xmath342 direction is of the half - v type , in the @xmath343 and @xmath344 directions it is of half - u type , in the @xmath345 and @xmath334 direction it is of u - type , while in the @xmath346 direction , which is along @xmath146 , there is no entrapment as the system is isoenergetic ."
