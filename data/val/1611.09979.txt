    "trapped atomic ions are used in a range of experiments and applications , including atomic clocks  @xcite , cold chemistry  @xcite , precision measurements of fundamental physics  @xcite , and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "the long - term goals of these experiments have led to efforts to miniaturize the system to meet application specifications and scalability  @xcite , and in some cases aims for cryogenic ion trap systems  @xcite .",
    "efforts using unconventional or multiple ion species put additional demands on the system . these directions may require different methods for initial loading of the ion trap .    the standard method for loading an ion trap consists of producing a flux of neutral atoms , and then ionizing these atoms within the trapping volume",
    ". a neutral flux of atoms is commonly produced by resistively heating a sample , and these atoms are then ionized at the trap using either electron bombardment  @xcite or photoionization  @xcite .",
    "while electron bombardment is applicable to any atomic species , it can reduce the lifetime of the trapped ions by contaminating the vacuum , and the accumulation of charge on insulators can result in additional micromotion or even destabilize the trap .",
    "although photoionization can avoid the issues related to electron bombardment , there can be significant overhead associated with the additional lasers , which can become substantial when working with multiple elements , atoms requiring unconventional wavelengths , or multiply - charged ions .",
    "finally , producing neutral atom flux with a standard resistively - heated source can be difficult when working with elements that aggressively react in air  @xcite , refractory elements that require high temperatures , or where miniaturization or cryogenic designs may prohibit the use of these sources . given the limitations of standard loading procedures , other methods for loading ion traps are being actively pursued  @xcite .",
    "laser ablation of a sample offers an alternative method for loading ion traps . in general",
    ", a laser pulse with sufficient peak fluence incident on a sample can vaporize a fraction of the material , producing atoms , ions , molecules , and clusters  @xcite .",
    "thus , for ion trap experiments ablation can be used as a source of neutral atom flux  @xcite , or can directly produce ions  @xcite , including multiply - charged species  @xcite . in reference",
    "@xcite , zimmermann _",
    "_ demonstrated the use of a compact nitrogen laser for producing ions by laser ablation , including some multiply - charged species .",
    "here we use a similar setup to measure the ion yield from several elements , including lanthanum , erbium , and dysprosium , which have only recently been proposed for use in cold trapped ion experiments  @xcite .",
    "we then focus on barium ion production , investigating the ion yield for different samples as a function of the number of ablation pulses applied , the ion yield as a function of the pulse energy , and the efficiency of loading an ion trap as a function of radiofrequency voltage .",
    "ions are produced by laser ablation of a sample with pulses from a commercial nitrogen laser ( stanford research systems , nl100 ) .",
    "the pulses from this laser are specified by the manufacturer to have a wavelength of about 337 nm , maximum energy of about 170 @xmath0j , duration of about 3.5 ns , and repetition rates up to 20 hz . to increase the laser fluence for ablation ,",
    "the pulses are focused onto the sample using a pair of lenses ( l1 and l2 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tof_setup ] .",
    "we measure the resulting spot size by attenuating the pulses , temporarily removing the mirror ( m1 ) , and placing a camera ( point grey , fl3-u3 - 13s2m - cs ) at the laser focus .",
    "pulsing the laser near its maximum repetition rate allows us to image and measure the spot size , resulting in elliptical beam waists of approximately 280 @xmath0 m and 50 @xmath0 m  @xcite .",
    "when incident on the ablation target , we estimate the focal point to be within 1 mm of the sample , optimized by adjusting the position of the lenses to maximize the ion yield .",
    "a beam sampler ( bs ) directs a fraction of each pulse to a photodiode ( pd ) to trigger the oscilloscope for data acquisition .",
    "a mirror ( m1 ) in a piezo - actuated mount ( newport , ag - m100n ) can be used to sweep the pulses in each run through a location grid on the sample , but in practice this was found to be unnecessary for most samples .",

    "the distance between l1 and l2 is about 16 cm ; the path length from l2 to the sample is about 15 cm .",
    "the sample is typically held at about 805 v , the first grid at about 730 v , and the second and third grids at ground .",

    "we analyze the ions produced by ablation using a custom time - of - flight ( tof ) mass spectrometer based on the wiley - mclaren design  @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tof_setup ] .",
    "the sample ( target ) is mounted between two stainless steel blocks , which are mechanically and electrically attached to a stainless steel plate ( s ) held under vacuum at about @xmath2 torr .",
    "this sample plate is held at about 805 v , and the subsequent grid ( g1 ) is held at about 730 v , directing ions produced at the sample toward the remainder of the mass spectrometer .",
    "the second grid ( g2 ) is held at ground , and the potential difference between g1 and g2 provides most of the acceleration of the ions . after passing through g2 , ions travel through a nominally electric field - free drift region for mass separation , before reaching the third grid ( g3 ) , which is also held at ground  @xcite . after passing through g3 ,",
    "the ions are detected by a channeltron electron multiplier ( cem ; photonis , magnum 5900 ) , which has a large negative potential applied to it ( -2000 v ) .",

    "[ fig : barium_ions_vs_pulse_number ] , the ion yield for this target quickly decreases , even when the ablation pulses are swept across a 5x5 location grid in each scan .",
    "the unreliability of the elemental barium target led us to investigate alternative ablation targets , bao and batio@xmath3 .",
    "both of these targets produce a roughly constant yield of ba@xmath8 for at least 2000 ablation pulses at a single location on the sample ( fig .",

    "yield is roughly constant over at least 2000 ablation pulses on a single location for both bao and batio@xmath3 targets , with the batio@xmath3 target yield consistently higher .",
    "conversely , the ba@xmath8 yield from the ba target ( @xmath7 pure barium , exposed to atmosphere for approximately 30 minutes ) quickly decreases at a function of ablation pulse number . in this case , the data for ba was obtained by sweeping the ablation laser position across a 5x5 location grid on the sample ; due to the rapid decrease in ion yield , we could not obtain a satisfactory average of 25 tof spectra at a single location . ]",

    ", we measure the reflectivity of m1 and the transmission of the vacuum viewport , and the pulse energy prior to m1 at each attenuation level , and thus determine the pulse energy for each attenuation level at the sample .",
    "both samples exhibit a threshold for efficient barium ion production near 42 @xmath0j , or a peak fluence of approximately 0.2 j/@xmath9 .",
    "we conclude the ablation laser beam path should be carefully designed to maintain fluence above this threshold for efficient ion trap loading .",

    "barium ions produced by laser ablation of a batio@xmath3 target are confined in a four - rod radiofrequency ( rf ) paul trap .",
    "the trap , chamber , and optical setup are shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ion_trap_setup ] .",
    "the trap consists of four parallel stainless steel rods with diameter of 1.6 mm and center - to - center spacing of 3.3 mm between adjacent rods ( supported by macor spacers ) , and tungsten wire loops at each end around two opposing rods .",
    "a helical resonator is used to apply rf voltage to two opposing rods at 11 mhz at a maximum amplitude of about 310 v , with the other two rods held at ground .",
    "the tungsten wire loops serve as the endcaps , with a static 1 v applied to each , and an axial separation of 15 mm .",
    "the ablation target is located about 2.5 mm axially from the trap center , and is nearly flush with the outer edge of the rods . here ,",
    "we choose batio@xmath3 as the ablation target because of the higher ion yield measured previously ( fig .",
    "[ fig : barium_ions_vs_pulse_number ] ) , and because it is less brittle than the aged bao sample .",
    "pulses from a nitrogen laser are incident on the target to produce ions by laser ablation . trapped ions are detected by either the cem ( following release from the trap ) or by imaging ion fluorescence .",
    "light near 493.5 nm and 649.9 nm traverses the trap ( above the target ) to drive the @xmath10 and @xmath11 transitions in trapped ba@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "fluorescence from the trapped ions is imaged using lenses i1 and i2 onto a camera .",
    "the inset in the lower right shows a false - color , background - subtracted image of a trapped cloud of barium ions .",
    "cem is channeltron electron multiplier ; m1 is mirror in a piezo - actuated mount ; nf is notch filter centered at 494 nm ; i1 is 1-inch diameter , @xmath12 mm plano - convex lens ; i2 is 1-inch diameter , @xmath13 mm plano - convex lens .",
    "i1 is approximately @xmath14 from the trap center ; i2 is approximately @xmath15 from the camera ; distance between i1 and i2 is approximately 30 mm . ]",
    "the amplitude of the rf voltage at the output of the helical resonator and applied to the trap electrodes is determined by monitoring the voltage capacitively - coupled onto the endcap vacuum feedthrough pin .",
    "first , a small rf calibration signal with known amplitude , directly produced by a signal generator and measured on an oscilloscope , is applied to the vacuum feedthrough pin for the trap rf electrodes .",
    "this calibration signal is varied in amplitude and frequency to confirm the capacitively - coupled voltage at the endcap feedthrough pin is related by a constant scale factor in this range .",
    "then this scale factor , and the voltage measured at the endcap pin , is used to determine the rf amplitude produced by the helical resonator at the trap electrodes . here",
    "we assume the rf voltage at the vacuum feedthrough is equal to the rf voltage on the electrodes .",
    "we measure the relative fraction of ions trapped as a function of the applied rf voltage , with the results shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : trapped_ions_vs_rf_voltage ] .",
    "the experiment sequence is controlled by an fpga board ( terasic , de0-nano ) .",
    "the sequence consists of switching off the rf voltage for 1 ms , triggering the n@xmath16 laser and switching on the rf voltage , holding the trapped ions for a variable length of time ( here , 10 ms ) , and then switching off the rf voltage to detect the ions with the cem . as expected , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trapped_ions_vs_rf_voltage ] indicate that the number of trapped ions decreases as the rf voltage ( and thus the trap depth ) approaches zero",
    ". however , the relative fraction of ions trapped appears to plateau above an rf amplitude of about 175 v , which for an ideal linear quadrupole trap corresponds to a transverse trap depth of about 0.5 ev  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that above this voltage the transverse trap depth no longer limits the loading efficiency , which may indicate that the transverse trap depth is greater the average energy of the ablated ions .",
    "however , given the dynamics of both laser ablation and the trap loading procedure , more detailed analysis would be required to eliminate all other possible limiting factors  @xcite .",
    "we also observe a trapped barium ion cloud produced by laser ablation by directly imaging onto a camera the laser fluorescence from the ions , with an image shown as an inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : ion_trap_setup ] .",
    "the 493.5 nm used to drive the @xmath17 to @xmath18 transition is produced by a custom extended - cavity diode laser ( ecdl ; design similar to  @xcite ) operating near 987.1 nm that is frequency - doubled using a custom second - harmonic generation cavity ( design similar to  @xcite ) with a bibo crystal .",
    "light near 649.9 nm , used to drive the @xmath19 to @xmath18 transition , is directly produced by another custom ecdl . the optogalvanic signal from a commercial , single - ended , barium hollow cathode lamp ( perkin - elmer , n2025305 ) is used as a frequency reference for each laser . a simple imaging system composed of two singlet lenses ( i1 , focal length @xmath12 mm ; i2",
    ", focal length @xmath13 mm ) and a notch filter ( semrock , ff01 - 494/20 - 25 ) is used to image fluorescence from trapped ions onto a camera ( pointgrey , fl3-u3 - 13s2m - cs ) with an integration time of about 333 ms , where i1 is positioned approximately @xmath14 from the ion cloud and i2 is positioned approximately @xmath15 from the camera sensor ( the distance between i1 and i2 is about 30 mm ) .",
    "the resulting image of the trapped ion cloud confirms the production of barium ions by laser ablation , and the applicability of this loading method for experiments with trapped ions .",
    "laser ablation is a useful technique for directly producing atomic ions for trapped ion experiments . using a pulsed nitrogen laser , we produced ba , ca , dy , er , la , lu , and yb ions , and compared the relative ion yield for each . here",
    ", reliable production of ba ions appears to require using substrates other than pure barium , with consistent ion production demonstrated with bao and batio@xmath3 targets , and sufficient pulsed laser fluence .",
