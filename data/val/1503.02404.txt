    "2002 ) though eventually accretion from the intergalactic medium can not be neglected ( mirabel 1982 , wang et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "molecular clouds form in large structures or _ molecular complexes _ in specific areas of the galaxy .",
    "the taurus - auriga molecular complex ( tmc ) covers about 20@xmath0x20@xmath0 in the sky .",
    "the tmc is the prototype of filamentary molecular complex where star formation proceeds less efficiently than in massive clusters , such as the l1630 cloud in the orion molecular complex ( lada 19922 ) .",
    "the large filamentary structure of the tmc is reminiscent of the galactic open clusters distribution .",
    "molecular clouds are submitted to the ionising radiation field of the galaxy that produces photo evaporative flows on the surface .",
    "the hardness of the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field around the tmc can be readily inferred from the spear / fims imaging spectrograph observations .",
    "the cloud core and the halo region are clearly identified * ( lee et al .",
    "2006)*. the scattered far uv(1370  ",
    "1670 ) radiation is seen in , and beyond , the halo region ( where @xmath1  mag ) as plumes in photo - evaporative flows , on the scale of the spear / fims resolution : 5 - 10  arcmin or 0.2 - 0.4  pc .",
    "mapping the diffuse emission and the extinction variations at those optical depths provides important information on the physics of the cloud boundary that , contrary to the cloud interior , is not dominated by the gravitational field but by more subtle stresses .",
    "moreover , there is recent evidence of additional heating sources in the edge of the tmc , since the diffuse galactic uv radiation field can not solely account for the degree of excitation of the molecular hydrogen ( goldsmith et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "cloud haloes may provide important clues on the transmission / reflection of long wavelength modes of the galactic magnetic field , as those hypothesised by gmez de castro & pudritz ( 1992 , hereafter gdcp92 ) to describe the global properties of the taurus star - forming region .",
    "the geometry of the magnetic field in taurus has been traced by optical and infrared polarisation measurements ( vrba et al .",
    "1976 , moneti et al . 1984 ,",
    "heyer et al .",
    "1987 , goodman et al .",
    "1990 , chapman et al .",
    "the observations indicate that the field is well ordered on the scale of the whole cloud , but that it also contains a significant disordered component on the smaller scales ( goodman et al . 1990 ) .",
    "zeeman measurements of the field strength in molecular clouds indicate that magnetic and gravitational energy density are comparable .",
    "thus , magnetic fields must play a fundamental role in the dynamics of the cloud and the formation of structures such as the ubiquitous cores and filaments .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the dense filament substructure can vary from perpendicular to parallel alignments depending upon the filament ( vrba et al .",
    "1976 , heyer et al .",
    "1987 , goodman et al .",
    "a recent evaluation of the field relevance in the gas flow suggests that magnetic fields control the mass flow in the tmc diffuse envelope .",
    "heyer & brunt ( 2012 ) studied the alignment of the velocity anisotropy with the magnetic field over varying physical conditions and environments to conclude that the velocity anisotropy is aligned with the local , projected mean magnetic field direction in low surface brightness @xmath2co emission areas , corresponding to regions of low visual extinction and presumably , low gas volume density .",
    "this would be consistent with the presence of a large scale alfvn wave channelling the dynamics of the tmc , as suggested by gdcp92 .",
    "the coupling between the clouds and the ambient field relies on the dust grains ionisation and mass spectrum .",
    "dust grains contain most of the mass of the charged particle component in the molecular clouds interior .",
    "for typical clouds , the cut - off wavelength for the coupling with the ambient field decreases from 1  pc to 0.1  pc when dust grains are considered ( nakano , 1998 ) . also , the size of the dust grains is relevant for the resonance frequencies to alfvn waves propagation and the neutral - charge particles coupling ( pilipp et al .",
    "the near ultraviolet bump ( the 2175   bump ) is the most sensitive feature to the presence of small dust grains ( see i.e. draine 2003 ) and hence , to plasma field coupling .",
    "therefore , though the use of spectral tracers able to penetrate the dusty environment ( infrared , x - ray , radio - wavelengths ) is useful to study the gravitational collapse and the cloud fragmentation , important pieces of information leading to cloud formation and support are best accessed through uv observations .",
    "the galactic evolution explorer ( galex ) has surveyed the envelope of the tmc complex permitting * a study of * the dust spatial distribution with a sensitivity significantly higher than the conventional means ( molecular or infrared mapping ) . moreover , as the tmc is a well studied region , comprehensive mapping in various molecular probes such as co ( ungerechts & thaddeus 1987 , heyer et al .",

    "2007 , hereafter f07 , lombardi et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter lla10 ) is available allowing to study the relation between gas and dust density in various bands .",
    "for instance , the comparison between the relative extinctions in the galex nuv band , centred at the 2175   bump , and in the k band from the 2mass survey ( lla10 ) permits to evaluate variations in the average dust grains size over the tmc in a very efficient manner .",
    "evidence of dust grain growth in dense molecular gas filaments compared with the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) have been recently , reported from infrared studies ( see _ e.g. _ ysard et al 2013 study for the l1506 filament in taurus or flagey et al .",
    "2009 for a spitzer based study ) .",
    "the uv bump is , by far , the strongest spectral feature in the extinction curve but its source remains uncertain ( see _ e.g. _ the review by draine 2003*)*. though small graphite grains were proposed initially as the main source of the bump , the baseline today are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( weintgarner & draine , 2001 ) , that share with a graphite sheet , a similar structure in terms of the distribution of the carbon atoms .",
    "pahs are required to reproduce the observed infrared emission ( leger & puget , 1984 ) and they somewhat represent the extension of the dust grain size distribution into the molecular domain .    in this article , we derive a method to determine the strength of the 2175    bump from a combination of extinction measurements in the galex near uv ( nuv ) band and the 2mass k infrared band ( see sect .  2 ) . in section  3",
    ", we describe the galex all sky survey of the tmc , the quality and main characteristics of the data . in section  4 , we describe the method used to measure the extinction in the nuv band in the tmc and the results are analysed in section  5 .",
    "it is shown that the strength 2175    bump decreases with respect to the average ism values in the filaments gathering areas , namely , the low column density extensions of l1495 , l1498 and l1524 in taurus , l1545 , l1548 , l1519,l1513 in auriga and l1482 - 83 in the california region .",
    "these finding agrees with previous results on dust evolution derived from spitzer data .",
    "this indicates that within the halo of the molecular clouds , the dust grains are already rather large , affecting the coupling between the dust and the environmental magnetic field .",
    "a brief summary is provided at the end of the article .",
    "the extinction curve provides important clues about the properties of dust in space and the grains size distribution ( see , for instance the review by draine 2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the shape of the extinction curve is often modelled * using * to polynomial fits that extend from the far uv to the infrared using as free parameter @xmath6 . in this work ,",
    "we use the widespread extinction model derived by fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ( hereafter fm07 ) .",
    "the curve is well behaved from the 3  @xmath7 m to 0.3  @xmath7 m ; it allows a simple parametrisation in the infrared that extends smoothly into the optical range so , @xmath8 with @xmath9 and @xmath10 m for the average extinction law according to fm07 .",
    "hence , @xmath11    this smooth trend is broken in the uv range by the presence of the uv bump ; five coefficients are required for the mathematical representation of the extinction law in the uv ( see eq .  3 ) , two of them to fit the uv bump to a lorentzian function of ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "following fm07 , the extinction law in the nuv band is parametrised as ,    @xmath13    @xmath14    with @xmath15 and , @xmath16    parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants that depend on the specific line of sight . the area of the bump is given by @xmath19 and its maximum intensity by @xmath20 .",
    "the width of the bump varies considerably from line of sight ( los ) to los with an average value of @xmath21m@xmath22 but its central wavelength remains estable ( fitzpatrick & massa , 1986 ) .",
    "absorption by small graphite particles was first hypothesised , as the main source of this strong absorption however , variations in the graphite grain shape and size should produce variations both in @xmath18 and @xmath23 ( draine & malhotra 1993 ) .",
    "since the molecular structure of pahs molecules is very similar to a portion of a graphite sheet , pahs are a natural extension to the graphite hypothesis and are nowadays considered the main source of the bump ( see draine 2003 review for more details ) .    by definition ,    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is weighted over the galex nuv band . hence ,    @xmath26    @xmath27 @xmath28    with @xmath29 the normalised transmittance function of the galex nuv channel , @xmath30  and @xmath31   .",

    "6 * depends on @xmath18 since * it influences @xmath34*. we have evaluated this integral for the various @xmath18 values in fm07 ; they correspond to different los and extinction laws in the galaxy .",
    "we have found that the integral can be fitted to a linear function of @xmath18 such that , @xmath35 @xmath36 with rms=0.003 .",
    "this tight correlation was expected given the functional form of @xmath37 in the galex band and the strength of the 2175    feature .",
    "since the area of the 2175    bump also depends on @xmath18 , @xmath38 , then , @xmath39    and therefore , @xmath40    fm07 made a detailed evaluation of the extinction law parameters for several loss ( see table 4 in their article ) and using them , we have computed the @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 values for these specific loss ; also , we have computed them for the average ism coefficientsm@xmath22 , @xmath44m@xmath22 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ] as derived by fm07 ( see table  1 ) .    in general , our r(nuv - k ) is slightly larger than the values computed by yuan et al .",

    "notice that @xmath43 and @xmath49 values are well correlated unless for hd  3191 , which seems to be a peculiar .",
    "for this reason , it has been excluded , * and the resulting fit in fig .",
    "1 is : * @xmath50    this result is not a surprising ; it just points out that the ism extinction law admits a rather simple parametrisation from the near infrared to the near ultraviolet unless for the strength of the bump .",
    "therefore , for the dust grain size distributions observed in the ism , the main deviations from this trend are caused by the uv bump .",
    "likewise , the strength of the bump can be evaluated as a linear function of the nuv to k band extinction for the ism .",
    "note that this _ semi - empirical relation _ has been derived using the loss in fm07 that sample a broad range of extinction laws ( _ i.e. _ , r - values and bump strengths ) and it is independent of the physical origin of the bump be it pahs , small graphite grains or any other possible source ( _ e.g. _ fullerens , see wada et al .",
    "1999 ) .    in principle ,",
    "similar expressions could be derived for other bands however , the availability of the near infrared extinction map of the tmc ( lla10 ) makes the @xmath43 rate , well suited for our purpose .",
    "note that emission from average warm dust grains dominate the k - band while absorption by pahs or alike dominates the nuv band .",
    "mid - infrared images have also been used to test dust evolution by comparing the emission from pahs and very small grains with the radiation from large dust grains ( see _ i.e. _ flagey et al .",
    "however , the nuv range is ideally suited for this purpose given its high sensitivity to small particles ; the estimated oscillator strength per nucleon is @xmath51 for the 2175    bump ( draine , 1989 ) .     +     for the fm07 extinction law.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +    for completeness , we also note that , @xmath52 @xmath53 and thus , @xmath54 can be parametrised in terms of the strength of the bump and , as above , a simple scaling can be made in terms of the extinction law for various los , @xmath55 though the fit is significantly less accurate ( see fig .  2 ) .",

    "@xmath78 is small close to the filamentary networks ( compare fig  3 with fig  8) where also mid infrared data have detected the formation of large dust grains ( flagey et al . 2010 ) , as high density of molecular gas makes collisional processes more efficient assisting grain growth .",
    "in addition , the large density of dust in the filaments effectively shields the growing mantles against the environmental uv radiation .",
    "a detailed comparison between figure 4 and 8 , shows that the bump is less prominent towards the tail of the filaments leading to l1495 and l1498 .",
    "the first results from the herschel survey of the gould belt in taurus , show a fraction of this area : n1 - 3 for the filament leading to l1495 and s1 - 4 for that leading to l1498 .",
    "the analysis of herschel data shows that these filaments consist really in a hierarchy of cores of molecular gas with sizes in the range @xmath116pc that covers the full core mass function from unbound clumps to ( gravitationally bound ) pre - stellar cores , being all part of the same population ( kirk et al .",

    "matter lifted to the halo by the action of the instability , rains back along the magnetic field lines reaching velocities comparable to the alfvn speed in the undisturbed gas layer in the galactic plane .",
    "these velocities agree well with the clouds and pre - main sequence stars velocities that roughly run eastwards ( see gdcp92 ) .",
    "fresh material is thus expected to be gathered at the rear of the cloud , where it is , indeed . as the density increases with respect to the average ism values , so does the opacity protecting dust grains from the ambient uv radiation field and favouring grain growth . in this sense ,",

    "a generic method to determine the relative abundance of small dust grains from star counts and surveys has been described .",
    "these developments have been used to detect variations in the extinction law across the tmc .",
    "the extinction law tends to be greyer in the rear of the cloud and in the networks of filaments , than on the clean ism .",
    "this is consistent with the generic picture of large dust grains being formed in molecular clouds and small dust grains being more abundant in the ism .",
    "it is worth remarking that the areas where dust is being gathered are at the rear of the cloud , as expected if star formation at the head of the tmc is associated with a local storage of mass being gathered by the action of the parker - jeans instability .",
