    "the concept of natural selection , proposed by charles darwin and alfred russell wallace , is underlyed by a fundamental driving force that explains how the different types of species are in a permanent flux .",
    "several models apply this principle to modelate different kinds of populations using simple concepts , namely mutation ( i.e. changes in the genotype and phenotype of the individuals ) and selection ( according to the fitness differences between the elements of a population ) .",
    "additionally , a random drift in the whole population must be included in order to account for fluctuations and effects of noise in the population @xcite . in the recent years",
    ", some works have been analyzed fundamental mathematical aspects of co - evolutive dynamics in populations assuming frequency dependent selection ( a good review is given by nowak et .",
    "@xcite ; an estandart reference is the book of hofbauer and sigmund @xcite ) .",
    "however , this concept of evolution does not only concerns only dynamics of populations , but also systems in economy @xcite and even molecular biology @xcite .",
    "general abilities are usually assigned to competing populations of individuals of two different classes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in order to model mutation - selection processes .",
    "mathematically , such processes are usually modeled by game theory , where two individuals playing a game increase or decrease their scores according to the actions they adopt @xcite . in the context of biological sciences ,",
    "the score of the game is equivalent to the fitness of an individual .",
    "furthermore , if the individual plays in a rational way , the probability to obtain a higher fitness increases .",
    "therefore , the selection of a rational action depends on whether selfishness or altruism may improve the final fitness of the individual @xcite .    based on this principle",
    ", a kind of phase behavior can be defined for infinite populations . if the fitness ( defined by a pay - off matrix ) is used as a control parameter , then it is possible to control the number of individuals of both classes @xmath0 and @xmath1 into the population ( see for example @xcite , where the interaction matrix is rescaled ; lee et al .",
    "@xcite make an analysis of games with different pay - off functions ) .",
    "however , population dynamics can not be simply reduced to this phenotypic point of view .",
    "internal characteristics ( which can be more or less simple ) , related with the way in which individuals try to find out in an even more rational way the best action , must also be included .    within the present work",
    ", the phenotype will be related to the action each individual adopts ; this phenotype is a dynamical variable that depends on the perception and memory of individuals , which is of variable size .",
    "hence , the selection of a new action is based on the information stored from past moves , i.e. is a rational choice based on the direct information of the game ( and indirectly on the score each individual obtains ) .",
    "the individual s action evolves in order to adapt itself to the changes in the fitness .",
    "simultaneously , the size of the storage device evolves depending on the variation of the individual s fitness . from a biological point of view",
    ", the memory size is related to the individual s genetic pool , because it influences the strategies that each individual adopts as response to the pressure of the evolution dynamics @xcite .",
    "hence , depending on the actions , the genetic pool can mutate in order to increase the fitness .",
    "thus , individual s identity is changing .",
    "several works make an analysis of the effect of learning schemas in the co - evolutive dynamics and equilibrium of games @xcite . c. hauert",
    "@xcite also analyze the effect of the pay off matrix in the evolution of strategies in agents with large memories ; an alternative schema in economics is proposed by r. selten and r. stoecker @xcite ) . in these",
    "works the storage device is implemented using a linear schema , as a kind of genetic code .",
    "other models have used notions of learning implemented into the dynamics of the whole population and not into the dynamics of the individual itself @xcite .",
    "such schemas are not suitable to implement large memories .",
    "additionally , they do not allow the implementation of an analysis of the system under different cognitive scenarios , in particular under the influence of _ external information sources_.    the present model combines the notion of an ising learning schema and game theory @xcite , joining the stochastic of the population with the stochastic of a primitive perception model .",
    "such a model allows us to implement individuals with larger memories , implying a more complex dynamics of the memory distribution .",
    "furthermore , with this schema it is possible to model primitive learning aspects .",
    "we are also able to analyze the effect that external information may have onto the system ( similar to an _ external field _ ) .",
    "such external information source induces a kind of _ normative imitation _ into the individuals @xcite .",
    "the selection of strategies is therefore not only influenced by the dynamics of the population , but also by the dynamics related to the individual learning schema .",
    "the actions as well as the storage size co - evolve and are two observables in this model .",
    "the consideration of this dynamical memory as an observable of the population is a way to define diversity in the population accurately . from a biological point of view , the observation of the distribution of actions is a measure of the phenotypic diversity ; at the same time the observation of the distribution of memories is a measure of the genetic diversity .",
    "the basis of both distributions is a source of energy provided by the environment . in his book published in 1944",
    ", schrdinger explains that life maintains order by degradation of free energy and producing high entropy waste @xcite .",
    "however , this argument seems to be not enough to explain why diversity is not uniformly distributed . in the present model",
    "the _ diversity _ is measured as a function of the _ number of microstates with a given memory_. this observable has been overlooked , ignoring its wide - ranging effects on community structure and ecosystem process @xcite . given that this distribution depends on the pay - off and the internal energy of the individuals , as well as the external information , we are able to explore the _ shannon s distribution index _ , equivalent to the negative entropy of the system , as a function of the learning characteristics of the individuals as well as the influence of external information sources ( for example genetic material transported by water , wind or insects ) .",
    "an important question to solve is if the evolutive process takes place at the individual s or at the population s level .",
    "if the dynamics of the population is stochastic , then local variations of the processes may introduce qualitative changes in the dynamics @xcite . in the present approach individual s information processing",
    "introduces an additional element into the system .",
    "the whole population affects the fitness of each individual .",
    "but , if the individual is able to process information in order to produce an action , then the coevolutive process does not have only origin at the population level , i.e. individual characteristics influence the co - evolution of the population .    in the next section",
    "the fundamental definitions and the mathematical basis of the model are introduced . in the first subsection",
    "the mathematical basis of game theory is explained ; in the second and third subsections the dynamics of the actions and evolution of the memory size is explained .",

    "are two big parts : one for the analysis of the distribution of actions and a second for the analysis of the distribution of memories . in the last section a discussion of the results",
    "is presented .",
    "we describe a population of @xmath2 individuals .",
    "each individual adopts an individual action @xmath3 that influences its fitness . according to this action ,",
    "each individual can be of two types , either @xmath4 ( for individuals that cooperate ) or @xmath5 ( for individuals that defect ) .",
    "additionally the individuals can observe and store its own as well as the opponent s actions . with this information",
    "the agent can decides the new action .",
    "the size of the storage device ( memory size ) @xmath6 is also an individual characteristic and is defined as an observable .",
    "the action of individual @xmath7 is represented by a unitary vector @xmath8 , that can be either @xmath9 or @xmath10 for the two classes of actions @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the pay - off in the system depends on these actions and is given by the following matrix    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the opponent s action , @xmath13 is the fitness associated to the action of both individuals @xmath7 and @xmath14 . in the present model only pair interactions are allowed .",
    "the fitness matrix is represented by @xmath15 the scenario implemented in this work is for a prisoner s dilemma game , i.e. the matrix has the values @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is for temptation , @xmath18 for reward , @xmath19 for punishment and @xmath20 for sucker . in this model @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . using eq .",
    "( [ util_i ] ) , the outcome for the individual @xmath7 can be computed as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the number of neighbours .",
    "the utility is a fundamental quantity that should determine the co - evolutionary process .      _",
    "memory _ is defined as an individual device where the information of previous actions of the individual and its neighbours is stored . using this information",
    "a new action can be adopted .",
    "there are several techniques that simulate how this storage of information and implementation of new moves takes place ; usually such techniques are based on linear methods @xcite . in the present work , the memory works like a field that influences the dynamics of the new action ( that means the memory is associated to a kind of internal energy ; see fig .",

    "the mechanism for the definition of new actions is based on the perception of the information of the eigen actions of the reference individual and the actions of its opponents .",
    "when the system reaches an equilibrium state , i.e. the fluctuation of the action of each individual is equilibrated with the dissipation of the system , the probability that the action @xmath8 is part of the class of elements @xmath4 is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the partition function on the storage distribution of the individual @xmath7 given by @xmath48 the dynamics of the actions depends on the size of the storage , which simultaneously determines the size of the internal energy associated to each individual .",

    "the first describes how the information is handled by each of the individuals in the lattice ; the second describes how the internal characteristics of the individuals evolves ( storage capacity ) depending on the individual s fitness .",
    "both equations depend on the action each individual adopts .",
    "the first equation eventually reaches an equilibrium state after infinite times .",
    "therefore , the single dynamical equation that remains is the equation for the mutation of memories .",

    "the individual uses a particular memory .",
    "this implies , each individual adopts different game strategies for different opponents . in each time unit",
    "the following process takes place ( see fig . [ schema ] ) : each individual store the last own action and the action of its opponent in its memory ( in the figure represented as a semicircle ) ; with this information the individual decides its new action . in the next step the score of the game",
    "is computed ; this information is the individual utility @xmath60 in each lattice position .",
    "if this utility is lower than the utility on the neighbors , and the individual is allowed to do a mutation , then a change of the memory size from @xmath6 to @xmath61 takes place .",

    "each individual plays a parallel game against its neighbors .",
    "therefore , this function should scale proportional to the number of individuals playing different games . since that the behavior of the number of cooperators is similar to the magnetization in an ising model , the function that we use to fit this plot is defined as @xmath70=\\frac{\\tanh ( h - h_{0})}{g_{0 } } + g_{n}$ ] , where @xmath71 is the shift on the field , @xmath72 is a scaling factor according to the scale of @xmath73 and @xmath74 is a scaling factor on @xmath69 .",

    "the coupling of the system to the co - evolutive dynamics does not introduce phase transitions , but this dynamics , together with the dimension of the lattice where the simulations were performed , affect the dependence on the learning parameters .    _",
    "second _ , the dynamics of the game influences the memory distribution into the system .",
    "the variation of the external field influence the complexity of the distribution of memories and , therefore , the diversity of the distribution of individuals characterized by @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , an important conclusion is that the _ learning characteristics _ of the individuals may influence the distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "although the co - evolutive process is far from equilibrium , it may be influenced by external information imprinted into the system .",
    "the dimensionality of the storage device of the individuals is an important factor .",
    "a one dimensional storage device does not allows that @xmath43 may introduce a change in the phase behavior of the actions of the individuals . like more dimensional ising models , increasing of the dimension",
    "may introduce interesting effects that may have influence in the phase behavior of the distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "the final relevant result in this investigation is the _ role of the external information _ has in the _ entropy _ of the system . using this model we are able to analyse the genetic diversity of a population , which is the neg - entropy of the system .",
    "an external information source , changing the phenotype of the population , has an influence on the diversity of the system .",
    "in particular , the diversity increases if a large part of the population has a normative tendency to defect .",
    "this fact implies a reduction of the entropy of the system . in other words , _ diversity _ is not only a function of the size of the population @xcite , but also _ depends on cognitive characteristics and external sources of information_. this result can be a good approach to explain , why in some regions there are more diversity than in their neighbors , taking into account that genetic diversity is correlated to the community structure @xcite .",
    "a possible answer in such case is that animals , water or wind transport genetic material or signals that may influence the information exchange of the individuals .",
    "this phenomenon is not only exclusive in biology .",
    "intuitively , it is equivalent , for instance , to the effect of background music and advesting on consumption behavior of individuals in shopping malls . in this last case ,",
    "the external information , and not only budget , is the essential factor that affects individual behavior @xcite .",
    "the model implemented is a very simple approach that joints fundamental aspects from the theory of ferromagnetism with population dynamics in the frame of learning theory .",
    "this model can be extended to different directions . from a physical point of view",
    "it is interesting to make an analysis of the dimensionality of the memory in the individual s behavior . for high dimensional memories",
    "is possible to expect a critical behavior in the distribution of cooperators . in biology",
    "is interesting to make an analysis of the effect that an inhomogeneous and fluctuating external information source may have in the distribution of the population .",
    "finally , an extension from the lattice to a different topology in the interaction of agents may have interesting effects in the population s distribution .",
    "several scholars have in the last time discussed , if natural selection is a causal process at the population s level or if it takes place at individual s level . by accepting frequency dependent selection this causality",
    "is placed at the population level . however",
    ", if the individuals express a kind of cognition , related to the reaction to noise and information sources , then this causality must also account for the individual .",
    "in resume , in the present model we propose middle point into this dispute . by tuning external information as well as noise sources",
    "we are able to observe how same individuals may affect the population . by observing a mutation process",
    "we observe how the population influences the distribution of individuals .",
    "we have shown that this coupling have an important connection in the measure of diversity of the population . in particular",
    ", we showed that avoiding a cooperative behavior is possible to increase this diversity ."
