    "matrix decomposition is an important technique in numerical computations . for example",

    "lu : a generic matrix can be decomposed as a product of an upper triangular matrix and a lower triangular matrix .",
    "qr : every matrix can be decomposed as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix .",
    "svd : every matrix can be decomposed as a product of two orthogonal matrices and a diagonal matrix .",
    "these matrix decompositions play a central role in engineering and scientific problems related to matrix computations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "for example , to solve a linear system @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an @xmath0 matrix and @xmath3 is a column vector of length @xmath4 .",
    "we can first apply lu decomposition to @xmath2 to obtain @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a lower triangular matrix and @xmath7 is an upper triangular matrix .",
    "next , we can solve @xmath8 to obtain the solution of the original linear equation .",
    "the advantage of decomposing @xmath2 into the product of @xmath6 and @xmath7 first is that solving linear equations with triangular matrix coefficient is much easier than solving the one with general matrix coefficient .",
    "similar idea applies to qr and svd decompositions .    those classical matrix decompositions ( lu , qr and svd decompositions ) correspond to bruhat , iwasawa , and cartan decompositions of lie groups @xcite .",
    "other than those classical ones , there are other matrix decompositions .",
    "for instance ,    1 .   every @xmath0 matrix is a product of @xmath9 toeplitz ( resp .",
    "hankel ) matrices @xcite .",
    "every matrix is a product of two symmetric matrices @xcite .",
    "as we have seen for classical matrix decompositions , toeplitz , hankel and symmetric matrix decompositions are important in the sense that structured matrices are well understood .",
    "for example , a toeplitz linear system can be solved in @xmath10 using displacement rank @xcite , compared to at least @xmath11 for general linear systems .",
    "sometimes the matrix decomposition refers to the decomposition of a matrix into the sum of two matrices , see for example , @xcite .",
    "however , whenever we mention the matrix decomposition in this paper , we always refer to the multiplicative version .    in this article , we study matrix decompositions beyond those mentioned above .",
    "we use algebraic geometry as our tool to explore the existence of matrix decompositions for various structured matrices .",
    "we define necessary notions in section [ sec : algebraic geometry ] and we prove some general results for the matrix decomposition problem and establish a strategy to tackle the matrix decomposition problem in section [ sec : general method ] . in section [ sec : toy example ]",
    "we discuss the matrix decomposition problem with two factors and recover the lu decomposition and the qr decomposition for generic matrices using our method . here the lu ( resp .",
    "qr ) decomposition for generic matrices means that the set of matrices which can be written as the product of a lower triangular ( resp .",
    "orthogonal ) matrix and an upper triangular matrix is a dense subset ( with the zariski topology ) of the space of all @xmath0 matrices .    in section [ sec : linear spaces ] we apply the strategy built in section [ subsec : strategy ] to matrix decomposition problem for linear subspaces .",
    "lastly , in section [ sec : nonlinear ] we apply the strategy to matrix decomposition problem for non - linear varieties .",
    "we summarize our contributions in the following list :    1 .   bidiagonal decomposition ( section [ subsec : bidiagonal ] ) .",
    "2 .   skew symmetric decomposition ( section [ subsec : skew symmetric ] ) .",
    "3 .   symmetric toeplitz decomposition and persymmetric hankel decomposition ( section [ subsec : symmetric toeplitz ] ) 4 .",
    "generic decomposition ( section [ subsec : generic ] ) .",
    "companion decomposition ( section [ subsec : companion ] )",
    ".   generalized vandermonde decomposition ( section [ subsec : generalized vandermonde ] ) .    for each type of matrices in the list above ,",
    "we first prove the existence of the matrix decomposition for a generic matrix , in the sense that the set of all matrices which can not be decomposed as a product of matrices of the given type , is contained in a proper algebraic subvariety of @xmath12",
    ". then we use a result from topological group theory to prove the existence of the matrix decomposition for every matrix .",
    "the price we need to pay is to increase the number of factors .",
    "our method can only show the existence of the matrix decomposition and no algorithm can be obtained in general .",
    "however , we do find an algorithm for companion decomposition in [ subsec : companion ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce necessary notions in algebraic geometry needed in this paper .",
    "we work over complex numbers but all results hold over algebraically closed fields of characteristic zero .",
