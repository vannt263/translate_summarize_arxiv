    "when a superconductor ( s ) material is attached to a normal ( n ) conductor the transfer of charges across the ns interface is dominated by andreev processes  @xcite in which electrons ( holes ) are retroreflected as holes ( electrons ) adding ( destroying ) cooper pairs into the ground state .",
    "leakage of superconducting pairing correlations into the normal conductor has a profound impact when sandwiched quantum dots ( qds ) are considered . hence , multiple andreev reflections lead to the formation of andreev bound states observed in n - qd - s tunnel experiments when the normal contact acts as a probe terminal @xcite .",
    "these hybrid setups are excellent testbeds to examine the interplay between coulomb interaction and proximity effects . in particular , n - qd - s systems exhibit remarkable conductance changes in the cotunneling regime  @xcite originated from the occurrence of zero - bias anomalies , which at much lower temperatures arise from the competition between kondo physics  @xcite and the yu - shiba - rusinov states ( usual andreev bound states in magnetically active platforms ) . indeed , the yu - shiba - rusinov states are viewed as precursors of majorana quasiparticles in hybrid systems with large spin - orbit interaction and magnetic fields  @xcite .",
