    "the continuum representation of matter is widely used for material dynamics in science and engineering .",
    "spatially - resolved continuum dynamics simulations are the most widespread and familiar , solving the initial value problem by discretizing the spatial domain and integrating the dynamical equations forward in time to predict the motion and deformation of components of the system .",
    "this type of simulation is used , for instance , to study hypervelocity impact problems such as the vulnerability of armor to projectiles @xcite , the performance of satellite debris shields @xcite , and the impact of meteorites with planets , notably the formation of the moon @xcite .",
    "the problem can be divided into the dynamical equations of the continuum , the state field of the components @xmath0 , and the inherent properties of the materials .",
    "given the local material state @xmath1 , the material properties allow the stress @xmath2 to be determined .",
    "given the stress field @xmath3 and mass density field @xmath4 , the dynamical equations describe the fields of acceleration , compression , and thermodynamic work done on the materials .",
    "the equations of continuum dynamics describe the behavior of a dynamically deforming system of arbitrary complexity .",
    "particular , simpler deformation paths can be described more compactly by different sets of equations , and solved by different techniques than those used for continuum dynamics in general .",
    "simpler deformation paths occur often in experiments designed to develop and calibrate models of material properties .",
    "these paths can be regarded as different ways of interrogating the material properties .",
    "the principal examples in material dynamics are shock and ramp compression @xcite .",
    "typical experiments are designed to induce such loading histories and measure or infer the properties of the material in these states before they are destroyed by release from the edges or by reflected waves .",
    "the development of the field of material dynamics was driven by applications in the physics of hypervelocity impact and high explosive systems , including nuclear weapons @xcite . in the regimes of interest ,",
    "typically components with dimensions ranging from millimeters to meters and pressures from 1gpa to 1tpa , material behavior is dominated by the scalar equation of state ( eos ) : the relationship between pressure , compression ( or mass density ) , and internal energy .",
    "other components of stress ( specifically shear stresses ) are much smaller , and chemical explosives react promptly so can be treated by simple models of complete detonation .",
    "eos were developed as fits to experimental data , particularly to series of shock states and to isothermal compression measurements @xcite .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to construct shock and ramp compression states from an eos algebraically or numerically depending on the eos , and to fit an eos to these measurements .",
    "more recently , applications and scientific interest have grown to include a wider range of pressures and time scales , such as laser - driven inertial confinement fusion @xcite , and experiments are designed to measure other aspects than the eos , such as the kinetics of phase changes , constitutive behavior describing shear stresses , incomplete chemical reactions , and the effects of microstructure , including grain orientation and porosity .",
    "theoretical techniques have also evolved to predict the eos with @xmath51%   accuracy @xcite and elastic contributions to shear stress with slightly poorer accuracy @xcite .",
    "a general convention for representing material states is described , and numerical methods are reported for calculating shock and ramp compression states from general representations of material properties .",
    "the desired structure for the description of the material state and properties under dynamic loading was developed to be as general as possible with respect to the types of material or models to be represented in the same framework , and designed to give the greatest amount of commonality between spatially - resolved simulations and calculations of shock and ramp compressions .    in condensed matter on sub - microsecond time scales ,",
    "heat conduction is often too slow to have a significant effect on the response of the material , and is ignored here .",
    "the equations of non - relativistic continuum dynamics are , in lagrangian form , _",
    "i.e. _ along characteristics moving with the local material velocity @xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the mass density and @xmath9 the specific internal energy .",
    "changes in @xmath9 can be related to changes in the temperature @xmath10 through the heat capacity .",
    "the inherent properties of each material in the problem are described by its constitutive relation or equation of state @xmath11 . as well as experiencing compression and work from mechanical deformation",
    ", the local material state @xmath12 can evolve through internal processes such as plastic flow .",
    "in general , @xmath13     \\quad:\\quad u\\equiv { \\mbox{grad}}\\,\\vec u(\\vec r , t ) \\\\\\ ] ] which can also include the equations for @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "thus the material properties must describe at a minimum @xmath11 and @xmath16 $ ] for each material .",
    "if they also describe @xmath17 , the conductivity , and @xmath18 , then heat conduction can be treated .",
    "other functions may be needed for particular numerical methods in continuum dynamics , such as the need for wave speeds ( _ e.g. _ the longitudinal sound speed ) , which are needed for time step control in explicit time integration .",
    "internally , within the material properties models , it is desirable to re - use software as much as possible , and other functions of the state are therefore desirable to allow models to be constructed in a modular and hierarchical way . arithmetic manipulations must be performed on the state during numerical integration , and these can be encoded neatly using operator overloading , so the operator of the appropriate type is invoked automatically without having to include ` if - then - else ' structures for each operator as is the case in non - object - oriented programming languages such as fortran-77 . for instance , if @xmath19 is calculated in a forward - time numerical method then changes of state are calculated using numerical evolution equations such as @xmath20 thus for a general state @xmath1 and its time derivative @xmath19 , which has an equivalent set of components , it is necessary to multiply a state by a real number and to add two states together . for a specific software implementation ,",
    "other operations may be needed , for example to create , copy , or destroy a new instance of a state .",
    "the attraction of this approach is that , by choosing a reasonably general form for the constitutive relation and associated operations , it is possible to separate the continuum dynamics part of the problem from the inherent behavior of the material .",
    "the relations describing the properties of different types of material can be encapsulated in a library form where the continuum dynamics program need know nothing about the relations for any specific type of material , and _ vice versa_. the continuum dynamics programs and the material properties relations can be developed and maintained independently of each other , provided that the interface remains the same ( table  [ tab : interface ] ) .",
    "this is an efficient way to make complicated material models available for simulations of different types , including lagrangian and eulerian hydrocodes operating on different numbers of dimensions , and calculations of specific loading or heating histories such as shock and ramp loading discussed below .",
    "software interfaces have been developed in the past for scalar eos with a single structure for the state @xcite , but object - oriented techniques make it practical to extend the concept to much more complicated states , to combinations of models , and to alternative types of model selected when the program is run , without having to find a single super - set state encompassing all possible states as special cases .",
    "a very wide range of types of material behavior can be represented with this formalism . at the highest level ,",
    "different types of behavior are characterized by different structures for the state @xmath1 ( table  [ tab : stateexamples ] ) . for each type of state ,",
    "different specific models can be defined , such as perfect gas , polytropic and grneisen eos . for each specific model , different materials",
    "are represented by choosing different values for the parameters in the model , and different local material states are represented through different values for the components of @xmath1 . in the jargon of object - oriented programming ,",
    "the ability to define an object whose precise type is undetermined until the program is run is known as polymorphism . for our application",
    ", polymorphism is used at several levels in the hierarchy of objects , from the overall type of a material ( such as ` one represented by a pressure - density - energy eos ' or ` one represented by a deviatoric stress model ' ) through the type of relation used to describe the properties of that material type ( such as perfect gas , polytropic , or grneisen for a pressure - density - energy eos , or steinberg - guinan @xcite or preston - tonks - wallace @xcite for a deviatoric stress model ) , to the type of general mathematical function used to represent some of these relations ( such as a polynomial or a tabular representation of @xmath21 in a polytropic eos ) ( table  [ tab : polymorphism ] ) .",
    "states or models may be defined by extending or combining other states or models  this can be implemented using the object - oriented programming concept of inheritance .",
    "thus deviatoric stress models can be defined as an extension to _ any _ pressure - density - energy eos ( they are usually written assuming a specific type , such as steinberg s cubic grneisen form ) , homogeneous mixtures can be defined as combinations of any pressure - density - temperature eos , and heterogeneous mixtures can be defined as combinations of materials each represented by any type of material model .",
    "trial implementations have been made as libraries in the c++ and java programming languages @xcite .",
    "the external interface to the material properties was general at the level of representing a generic material type and state .",
    "the type of state and model were then selected when programs using the material properties library were run . in c++ , objects which were polymorphic at run time had to be represented as pointers , requiring additional software constructions to allocate and free up physical memory associated with each object .",
    "it was possible to include general re - usable functions as polymorphic objects when defining models : real functions of one real parameter could be polynomials , transcendentals , tabular with different interpolation schemes , piecewise definitions over different regions of the one dimensional line , sums , products , etc ; again defined specifically at run time .",
    "object - oriented polymorphism and inheritance were thus very powerful techniques for increasing software re - use , making the software more compact and more reliable through the greater use of functions which had already been tested .    given conceptual and software structures designed to represent general material properties suitable for use in spatially - resolved continuum dynamics simulations , we now consider the use of these generic material models for calculating idealized loading paths .",
    "experiments to investigate the response of materials to dynamic loading , and to calibrate parameters in models of their behavior , are usually designed to apply as simple a loading history as is consistent with the transient state of interest .",
    "the simplest canonical types of loading history are shock and ramp @xcite .",
    "methods of solution are presented for calculating the result of shock and ramp loading for materials described by generalized material models discussed in the previous section .",
    "such direct solution removes the need to use a time- and space - resolved continuum dynamics simulation , allowing states to be calculated with far greater efficiency and without the need to consider and make allowance for attributes of resolved simulations such as the finite numerical resolution and the effect of numerical and artificial viscosities .",
    "ramp compression is taken here to mean compression or decompression . if the material is represented by an inviscid scalar eos , _",
    "i.e. _ ignoring dissipative processes and non - scalar effects from elastic strain , ramp compression follows an isentrope .",
    "this is no longer true when dissipative processes such as plastic heating occur .",
    "the term ` quasi - isentropic ' is sometimes used in this context , particularly for shockless compression ; here we prefer to refer to the thermodynamic trajectories as adiabats since this is a more appropriate term : no heat is exchanged with the surroundings on the time scales of interest .    for adiabatic compression , the state evolves according to the second law of thermodynamics , @xmath22 where @xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath23 the specific entropy .",
    "thus @xmath24 or for a more general material whose stress tensor is more complicated than a scalar pressure , @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the component of stress normal to the direction of deformation .",
    "the velocity gradient was expressed through a compression factor @xmath27 and a strain rate @xmath28 . in all ramp experiments used in the development and calibration of accurate material models ,",
    "the strain has been applied uniaxially .",
    "more general strain paths , for instance isotropic or including a shear component , can be treated by the same formalism , and that the working rate is then a full inner product of the stress and strain tensors .",
    "the acceleration or deceleration of the material normal to the wave as it is compressed or expanded adiabatically is @xmath29 from which it can be deduced that @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the longitudinal wave speed .    as with continuum dynamics , internal evolution of the material state",
    "can be calculated simultaneously with the continuum equations , or operator split and calculated periodically at constant compression @xcite .",
    "the results are the same to second order in the compression increment .",
    "operator - splitting allows calculations to be performed without an explicit entropy , if the continuum equations are integrated isentropically and dissipative processes are captured by internal evolution at constant compression .",
    "operator - splitting is desirable when internal evolution can produce highly nonlinear changes , such as reaction from solid to gas : rapid changes in state and properties can make numerical schemes unstable .",
    "operator - splitting is also desirable when the integration time step for internal evolution is much shorter than the continuum dynamics time step .",
    "neither of these considerations is very important for ramp compression without spatial resolution , but operator - splitting was used as an option in the ramp compression calculations for consistency with continuum dynamics simulations .",
    "the ramp compression equations were integrated using forward - time runge - kutta numerical schemes of second order .",
    "the fourth order scheme is a trivial extension .",
    "the sequence of operations to calculate an increment of ramp compression is as follows :    1 .",
    "time increment : @xmath32 2 .",
    "predictor : @xmath33 3 .",
    "corrector : @xmath34 4 .",
    "internal evolution : @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the model - dependent state evolution from applied strain , and @xmath37 is internal evolution at constant compression .",
    "the independent variable for integration is specific volume @xmath38 or mass density @xmath8 ; for numerical integration finite steps are taken in @xmath8 and @xmath38 .",
    "the step size @xmath39 can be controlled so that the numerical error during integration remains within chosen limits .",
    "a tabular adiabat can be calculated by integrating over a range of @xmath38 or @xmath8 , but when simulating experimental scenarios the upper limit for integration is usually that one of the other thermodynamic quantities reaches a certain value , for example that the normal component of stress reaches zero , which is the case on release from a high pressure state at a free surface .",
    "specific end conditions were found by monitoring the quantity of interest until bracketed by a finite integration step , then bisecting until the stop condition was satisfied to a chosen accuracy . during bisection , each trial calculation was performed as an integration from the first side of the bracket by the trial compression .",
    "shock compression is the solution of a riemann problem for the dynamics of a jump in compression moving with constant speed and with a constant thickness .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot ( rh ) equations @xcite describing the shock compression of matter are derived in the continuum approximation , where the shock is a formal discontinuity in the continuum fields . in reality , matter is composed of atoms , and shocks have a finite width governed by the kinetics of dissipative processes  at a fundamental level , matter does not distinguish between shock compression and ramp compression with a high strain rate  but the rh equations apply as long as the width of the region of matter where unresolved processes occur is constant .",
    "compared with the isentropic states induced by ramp compression in a material represented by an eos , a shock always increases the entropy and hence the temperature",
    ". with dissipative processes included , the distinction between a ramp and a shock may become blurred .",
    "the rh equations express the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy across a moving discontinuity in state .",
    "they are usually expressed in terms of the pressure , but are readily generalized for materials supporting shear stresses by using the component of stress normal to the shock ( _ i.e. _ , parallel with the direction of propagation of the shock ) , @xmath26 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the speed of the shock wave with respect to the material , @xmath42 is the change in material speed normal to the shock wave ( _ i.e. _ , parallel to its direction of propagation ) , and subscript @xmath43 refers to the initial state .    the rh relations can be applied to general material models if a time scale or strain rate is imposed , and an orientation chosen for the material with respect to the shock .",
    "shock compression in continuum dynamics is almost always uniaxial .",
    "the rh equations involve only the initial and final states in the material .",
    "if a material has properties that depend on the deformation path  such as plastic flow or viscosity  then physically the detailed shock structure may make a difference @xcite .",
    "this is a limitation of discontinuous shocks in continuum dynamics : it may be addressed as discussed above by including dissipative processes and considering ramp compression , if the dissipative processes can be represented adequately in the continuum approximation .",
    "spatially - resolved simulations with numerical differentiation to obtain spatial derivatives and forward time differencing are usually not capable of representing shock discontinuities directly , and an artificial viscosity is used to smear shock compression over a few spatial cells @xcite .",
    "the trajectory followed by the material in thermodynamic space is a smooth adiabat with dissipative heating supplied by the artificial viscosity . if plastic work is also included during this adiabatic compression , the overall heating for a given compression is greater than from the rh equations . to be consistent ,",
    "plastic flow should be neglected while the artificial viscosity is non - zero .",
    "this localized disabling of physical processes , particularly time - dependent ones , during the passage of the unphysically smeared shock was previously found necessary for numerically stable simulations of detonation waves by reactive flow @xcite .",
    "are reactive shock waves . steady planar detonation ( the chapman - jouguet state @xcite ) may be calculated using the rh relations , by imposing the condition that the material state behind the shock is fully reacted .",
    "several numerical methods have been used to solve the rh equations for materials represented by an eos only @xcite .",
    "the general rh equations may be solved numerically for a given shock compression @xmath39 by varying the specific internal energy @xmath9 until the normal stress from the material model equals that from the rh energy equation , eq .  [ eq : rh3 ] .",
    "the shock and particle speeds are then calculated from eqs  [ eq : rh1 ] and [ eq : rh2 ] .",
    "this numerical method is particularly convenient for eos of the form @xmath44 , as @xmath9 may be varied directly .",
    "solutions may still be found for general material models using @xmath18 , by which the energy may be varied until the solution is found .",
    "numerically , the solution was found by bracketing and bisection :    1 .",
    "for given compression @xmath39 , take the low - energy end for bracketing as a nearby state @xmath45 ( _ e.g. _ the previous state , of lower compression , on the hugoniot ) , compressed adiabatically ( to state @xmath46 ) , and cooled so the specific internal energy is @xmath47 .",
    "2 .   bracket the desired state : apply successively larger heating increments @xmath48 to @xmath46 , evolving each trial state internally , until @xmath49 from the material model exceeds @xmath50 from eq .",
    "[ eq : rh3 ] .",
    "3 .   bisect in @xmath48 , evolving each trial state internally , until @xmath49 equals @xmath50 to the desired accuracy .",
    "as with ramp compression , the independent variable for solution was mass density @xmath8 , and finite steps @xmath39 were taken .",
    "each shock state was calculated independently of the rest , so numerical errors did not accumulate along the shock hugoniot .",
    "the accuracy of the solution was independent of @xmath39 .",
    "a tabular hugoniot can be calculated by solving over a range of @xmath8 , but again when simulating experimental scenarios it is usually more useful to calculate the shock state where one of the other thermodynamic quantities reaches a certain value , often that @xmath51 and @xmath26 match the values from another , simultaneous shock calculation for another material ",
    "the situation in impact and shock transmission problems , discussed below .",
    "specific stop conditions were found by monitoring the quantity of interest until bracketed by a finite solution step , then bisecting until the stop condition was satisfied to a chosen accuracy . during bisection , each trial calculation was performed as a shock from the initial conditions to the trial shock compression .",
    "the accuracy of these numerical schemes was tested by comparing with shock and ramp compression of a material represented by a perfect gas eos , @xmath52 the numerical solution requires a value to be chosen for every parameter in the material model , here @xmath53 .",
    "air was chosen as an example material , with @xmath54 .",
    "air at standard temperature and pressure has approximately @xmath55g/@xmath56 and @xmath57mj / kg .",
    "isentropes for the perfect gas eos have the form @xmath58 and shock hugoniots have the form @xmath59 the numerical solutions reproduced the principal isentrope and hugoniot to @xmath60%  and 0.1%  respectively , for a compression increment of 1%  along the isentrope and a solution tolerance of @xmath61gpa for each shock state ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pgascmp ] ) . over most of the range ,",
    "the error in the hugoniot was 0.02%  or less , only approaching 0.1%  near the maximum shock compression .",
    "the ability to calculate shock and ramp loci in state space , _ i.e. _ as a function of varying loading conditions , is particularly convenient for investigating complex aspects of the response of condensed matter to dynamic loading . each locus can be obtained by a single series of shock or ramp solutions , rather than having to perform a series of time- and space - resolved continuum dynamics simulations , varying the initial or boundary conditions and reducing the solution .",
    "we consider the calculation of temperature in the scalar eos , the effect of material strength and the effect of phase changes .",
    "the continuum dynamics equations can be closed using a mechanical eos relating stress to mass density , strain , and internal energy . for a scalar eos ,",
    "the ideal form to close the continuum equations is @xmath44 , with @xmath62 the natural choice for the primitive state fields .",
    "however , the temperature is needed as a parameter in physical descriptions of many contributions to the constitutive response , including plastic flow , phase transitions , and chemical reactions . here",
    ", we discuss the calculation of temperature in different forms of the scalar eos .",
    "if the scalar eos is constructed from its underlying physical contributions for continuum dynamics , it may take the form @xmath63 , from which @xmath64 can be calculated using the second law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "an example is the ` sesame ' form of eos , based on interpolated tabular relations for @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "a pair of relations @xmath65 can be used as a mechanical eos by eliminating @xmath10 , which is equivalent to inverting @xmath63 to find @xmath66 , then substituting in @xmath64 . for a general @xmath63 relation , for example for the sesame eos",
    ", the inverse can be calculated numerically as required , along an isochore . in this way",
    ", a @xmath65 can be used as a @xmath44 eos .",
    "alternatively , the same @xmath64 relation can be used directly with a primitive state field including temperature instead of energy : @xmath67 .",
    "the evolution of the state under mechanical work then involves the calculation of @xmath68 , _",
    "i.e. _ the reciprocal of the specific heat capacity , which is a derivative of @xmath63 . as this calculation does not require @xmath63 to be inverted , it is computationally more efficient to use @xmath65 eos with a temperature - based , rather than energy - based , state .",
    "the main disadvantage is that it is more difficult to ensure exact energy conservation as the continuum dynamics equations are integrated in time , but any departure from exact conservation is at the level of accuracy of the algorithm used to integrate the heat capacity .",
    "both structures of eos have been implemented for material property calculations . taking a sesame type eos ,",
    "thermodynamic loci were calculated with @xmath69 or @xmath70 primitive states , for comparison ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alcmpt ] ) . for a monotonic eos ,",
    "the results were indistinguishable within differences from forward or reverse interpolation of the tabular relations . when the eos , or the effective surface using a given order of interpolating function , was non - monotonic , the results varied greatly because of non - uniqueness when eliminating @xmath10 for the @xmath69 primitive state .",
    "mechanical eos are often available as empirical , algebraic relations @xmath44 , derived from shock data .",
    "temperature can be calculated without altering the mechanical eos by adding a relation @xmath66 .",
    "while this relation could take any form in principle , one can also follow the logic of the grneisen eos , in which the pressure is defined in terms of its deviation @xmath71 from a reference curve @xmath72 . thus temperatures can be calculated by reference to a compression curve",
    "along which the temperature and specific internal energy are known , @xmath73 , and a specific heat capacity defined as a function of density @xmath74 . in the calculations , this augmented eos was represented as a ` mechanical - thermal ' form comprising any @xmath44 eos plus the reference curves  an example of software inheritance and polymorphism .",
    "one natural reference curve for temperature is the cold curve , @xmath75k .",
    "the cold curve can be estimated from the principal isentrope @xmath76 using the estimated density variation of the grneisen parameter : @xmath77 @xcite . in this work",
    ", the principal isentrope was calculated in tabular form from the mechanical eos , using the ramp compression algorithm described above .",
    "empirical eos are calibrated using experimental data .",
    "shock and adiabatic compression measurements on strong materials inevitably include elastic - plastic contributions as well as the scalar eos itself .",
    "if the elastic - plastic contributions are not taken into account self - consistently , the eos may implicitly include contributions from the strength .",
    "a unique scalar eos can be constructed to reproduce the normal stress as a function of compression for any unique loading path : shock or adiabat , for a constant or smoothly - varying strain rate .",
    "such an eos would not generally predict the response to other loading histories .",
    "the eos and constitutive properties for the materials considered here were constructed self - consistently from shock data  this does not mean the models are accurate for other loading paths , as neither the eos nor the strength model includes all the physical terms that real materials exhibit .",
    "this does not in any case matter for the purposes of demonstrating the properties of the numerical schemes .",
    "this mechanical - thermal procedure was applied to al using a grneisen eos fitted to the same shock data used to calculate the @xmath65 eos discussed above @xcite .",
    "temperatures were in good agreement ( fig .",
    "[ fig : alcmpt ] ) . the mechanical - thermal calculations required a similar computational effort to the tabular @xmath65 eos with a @xmath70 primitive states ( and",
    "were thus much more efficient than the tabular eos with @xmath69 states ) , and described the eos far more compactly .",
    "for dynamic compressions to @xmath78 and above , on microsecond time scales , the flow stress of solids is often treated as a correction or small perturbation to the scalar eos . however , the flow stress has been observed to be much higher on nanosecond time scales @xcite , and interactions between elastic and plastic waves may have a significant effect on the compression and wave propagation .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot equations should be solved self - consistently with strength included .",
    "there is an inconsistency in the standard continuum dynamics treatment of scalar ( pressure ) and tensor ( stress ) response .",
    "the scalar eos expresses the pressure @xmath44 as the dependent quantity , which is the most convenient form for use in the continuum equations .",
    "standard practice is to use sub - hookean elasticity ( hypoelastic form ) @xcite ( table  [ tab : stateexamples ] ) , in which the state parameters include the stress deviator @xmath79 , evolved by integration @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the shear modulus and @xmath28 the strain rate deviator . thus the isotropic and deviatoric contributions to stress are not treated in an equivalent way : the pressure is calculated from a local state involving a strain - like parameter ( mass density ) , whereas the stress deviator evolves with the time - derivative of strain .",
    "this inconsistency causes problems along complicated loading paths because @xmath81 varies strongly with compression : if a material is subjected to a shear strain @xmath82 , then isotropic compression ( increasing the shear modulus from @xmath81 to @xmath83 , leaving @xmath82 unchanged ) , then shear unloading to isotropic stress , the true unloading strain is @xmath84 , whereas the hypoelastic calculation would require a strain of @xmath85 . using be and the steinberg - guinan strength model as an example of the difference between hypoelastic and hyperelastic calculations , consider an initial strain to a flow stress of 0.3gpa followed by isothermal , isotropic compression to 100gpa , .",
    "the strain to unload to a state of isotropic stress is 0.20%  ( hyperelastic ) and 0.09%  ( hypoelastic ) .",
    "the discrepancy arises because the hypoelastic model does not increase the deviatoric stress under compression at constant deviatoric strain .",
    "the stress can be considered as a direct response of the material to the instantaneous state of elastic strain : @xmath86 .",
    "this relation can be predicted directly with electronic structure calculations of the stress tensor in a solid for a given compression and elastic strain state @xcite , and is a direct generalization of the scalar equation of state .",
    "a more consistent representation of the state parameters is to use the strain deviator @xmath82 rather than @xmath79 , and to calculate @xmath79 from scratch when required using @xmath87  a hyperelastic formulation .",
    "the state parameters are then @xmath88 .",
    "the different formulations give different answers when deviatoric strain is accumulated at different compressions , in which case the hyperelastic formulation is correct . if the shear modulus varies with strain deviator  _",
    "i.e. _ , for nonlinear elasticity  then the definition of @xmath89 must be adjusted to give the same stress for a given strain .",
    "many isotropic strength models use scalar measures of the strain and stress to parameterize work hardening and to apply a yield model of flow stress : @xmath90 inconsistent conventions for equivalent scalar measures have been used by different workers . in the present work , the common shock physics convention was used that the flow stress component of @xmath26 is @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the flow stress . for consistency with published speeds and amplitudes for elastic waves , @xmath93 , in contrast to other values previously used for lower - rate deformation @xcite . in principle , the values of @xmath94 and @xmath95 do not matter as long as the strength parameters were calibrated using the same values then used in any simulations .      the flow stress measured from laser - driven shock experiments on",
    "be crystals a few tens of micrometers thick is , at around 5 - 9gpa @xcite , much greater than the 0.3 - 1.3gpa measured on microsecond time scales .",
    "a time - dependent crystal plasticity model for be is being developed , and the behavior under dynamic loading depends on the detailed time dependence of plasticity .",
    "calculations were performed with the steinberg - guinan strength model developed for microsecond scale data @xcite , and , for the purposes of rough comparison , with elastic - perfectly plastic response with a flow stress of 10gpa .",
    "the elastic - perfectly plastic model neglected pressure- and work- hardening .",
    "calculations were made of the principal adiabat and shock hugoniot , and of a release adiabat from a state on the principal hugoniot .",
    "calculations were made with and without strength .",
    "considering the state trajectories in stress - volume space , it is interesting to note that heating from plastic flow may push the adiabat above the hugoniot , because of the greater heating obtained by integrating along the adiabat compared with jumping from the initial to the final state on the hugoniot ( fig .",

    "even with an elastic - perfectly plastic strength model , the with - strength curves do not lie exactly @xmath91 above the strengthless curves , because heating from plastic flow contributes an increasing amount of internal energy to the eos as compression increases .",
    "an important characteristic for the seeding of instabilities by microstructural variations in shock response is the shock stress at which an elastic wave does not run ahead of the shock . in",
    "be with the high flow stress of nanosecond response , the relation between shock and particle speeds is significantly different from the relation for low flow stress ( fig .",
    "[ fig : becmppus ] ) . for low flow stress ,",
    "the elastic wave travels at 13.2km / s .",
    "a plastic shock travels faster than this for pressures greater than 110gpa , independent of the constitutive model .",
    "the speed of a plastic shock following the initial elastic wave is similar to the low strength case , because the material is already at its flow stress , but the speed of a single plastic shock is appreciably higher .    for compression to a given normal stress ,",
    "the temperature is significantly higher with plastic flow included .",
    "the additional heating is particularly striking on the principal adiabat : the temperature departs significantly from the principal isentrope .",
    "thus ramp - wave compression of strong materials may lead to significant levels of heating , contrary to common assumptions of small temperature increases @xcite .",
    "plastic flow is largely irreversible , so heating occurs on unloading as well as loading .",
    "thus , on adiabatic release from a shock - compressed state , additional heating occurs compared with the no - strength case .",
    "these levels of heating are important as shock or release melting may occur at a significantly lower shock pressure than would be expected ignoring the effect of strength .",

    "an important property of condensed matter is phase changes , including solid - solid polymorphism and solid - liquid .",
    "an equilibrium phase diagram can be represented as a single overall eos surface as before .",

    "this model is described in more detail elsewhere @xcite . however , it is interesting to investigate the robustness of the numerical scheme for calculating shock hugoniots when the eos has the discontinuities in value and gradient associated with phase changes .",
    "the eos of molten metal , and the solid - liquid phase transition , can be represented to a reasonable approximation as an adjustment to the eos of the solid : @xmath97 where @xmath98 < \\delta h_m \\\\ e-\\delta h_m & \\quad : \\quad \\mbox{otherwise } \\\\",

    "given methods to calculate shock and adiabatic loading paths from arbitrary initial states , a considerable variety of experimental scenarios can be treated from the interaction of loading or unloading waves with interfaces between different materials , in planar geometry for uniaxial compression .",
    "the key physical constraint is that , if two dissimilar materials are to remain in contact after an interaction such as an impact or the passage of a shock , the normal stress @xmath26 and particle speed @xmath51 in both materials must be equal on either side of the interface .",
    "the change in particle speed and stress normal to the waves were calculated above for compression waves running in the direction of increasing spatial ordinate ( left to right ) . across an interface",
    ", the sense is reversed for the material at the left .",
    "thus a projectile impacting a stationary target to the right is decelerated from its initial speed by the shock induced by impact .",

    "examples of these wave interactions are the impact of a projectile with a stationary target ( fig .",

    "[ fig : shockrel ] ) , or tension induced as materials try to separate in opposite directions when joined by a bonded interface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : doublerel ] ) .",
    "each of these scenarios may occur in turn following the impact of a projectile with a target : if the target is layered then a shock is transmitted across each interface with a release or a reshock reflected back , depending on the materials ; release ultimately occurs at the rear of the projectile and the far end of the target , and the oppositely - moving release waves subject the projectile and target to tensile stresses when they interact ( fig .",
