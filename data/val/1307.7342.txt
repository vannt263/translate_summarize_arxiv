    "contemporary bcis are typically based on mental visual and motor imagery paradigms , which require extensive user training and good eyesight from the users  @xcite .",
    "recently alternative solutions have been proposed to make use of spatial auditory  @xcite or tactile ( somatosensory ) modalities  @xcite to enhance brain - computer interface comfort and increase the information transfer rate ( itr ) achieved by users .",
    "the concept reported in this paper further extends the previously reported by the authors in  @xcite brain somatosensory ( tactile ) channel to allow targeting of the tactile sensory domain for the operation of robotic equipment such as personal vehicles , life support systems , etc .",
    "the rationale behind the use of the tactile channel is that it is usually far less loaded than auditory or even visual channels in interfacing applications .",
    "the first report  @xcite of the successful employment of steady - state somatosensory responses to create a bci targeted a low frequency vibrotactile stimulus in the range of @xmath0  hz to evoke the subjects attentional modulation , which was then used to define interfacing commands .",
    "a more recent report  @xcite proposed using a braille stimulator with @xmath1  ms static push stimulus delivered to each of six fingers to evoke a somatosensory evoked potential ( sep ) response and the following p300 .",
    "the p300 response is a positive electroencephalogram event - related potential ( erp ) deflection starting at around @xmath2  ms and lasting for @xmath3  ms after an expected stimulus in a random series of distractors ( the so - called oddball eeg experimental paradigm )  @xcite .",
    "examples of averaged p300 response are depicted with red lines with standard errors in figures  [ fig : alltopo ] ,  [ fig : allerp ] ,  [ fig : s3erp ] ,  and  [ fig : s2erp ] .",
    "the p300 responses are commonly used in bci approaches and are considered to be the most reliable erps  @xcite with even beginner subjects .",
    "the results in  @xcite indicated that the experiments achieved information transfer rates of @xmath4  bit / min on average and @xmath5  bit / min for the best subject .",
    "a very recent report  @xcite additionally confirmed superiority of the tactile bci ( tbci ) in comparison with visual and auditory modalities tested with a locked  in syndrome ( lis ) subject  @xcite .",
    "this paper reports improvement of our previously reported finger stimulus tbci  @xcite based on p300 responses evoked by tactile stimulus delivered via vibrotactile transducers attached to five positions on the subject s chest this time .",
    "the proposal is similar to the previously reported waist positions based tbci reported in  @xcite with a difference that we propose to use the chest area simulation which simplifies a vehicular robot operation in comparison to our previous hand- and head - stimulus  based tbci solutions reported in  @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the next section introduces the materials and methods used in the study .",
    "it also outlines the experiments conducted .",
    "the results obtained in electroencephalogram online and offline experiments with five bci subjects are then discussed . finally , conclusions are formulated and directions for future research are outlined .",
    "five volunteer male bci subjects participated in the experiments . the subjects mean age was @xmath6 , with a standard deviation of @xmath7 .",
    "all the experiments were performed at the life science center of tara , university of tsukuba , japan .",
    "the online ( real - time ) eeg tbci paradigm experiments were conducted in accordance with the _ wma declaration of helsinki - ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects_.      the tactile stimulus was delivered as sinusoidal wave generated by a portable computer with max / msp software  @xcite .",
    "the stimuli were delivered via five channel outputs of an external _ digital - to - analog _ signal converter rme  fireface  ucx coupled with the two acoustic yamaha  p4050 power amplifiers ( four acoustic frequency channels each ) .",
    "the stimuli were delivered to the subjects chest locations via the tactile transducers hiwave hiax25c10 - 8/hs operating in the acoustic frequency spectrum of @xmath8  hz , as depicted in figure  [ fig : subject ] .",
    "each transducer in the experiments was set to emit a sinusoidal wave at @xmath9  hz to match the transducer s resonance frequency .",
    "tactile impulses were designed to stimulate the _ pacini endings _",
    "( fast - adapting type ii afferent type tactile sensory innervation receptors ) which are the large receptive field mechanoreceptors in deeper layers of human skin  @xcite .",
    "the training instructions were presented visually by means of the _ bci2000 _ program with numbers @xmath10 representing robot movement directions ( see table  [ tab : commands ] ) communicated via vibrotactile transducers attached to the subject s chest ( see figure  [ fig : subject ] ) .",
    "eeg signals were captured with an eeg amplifier system g.usbamp by g.tec medical engineering gmbh , austria , using @xmath11 active electrodes .",
    "the electrodes were attached to the head locations : _ cz , pz , p3 , p4 , c3 , c4 , cp5 , cp6 , p1 , p2 , poz , c1 , c2 , fc1 , fc2 , _ and _ fcz _ , as in the @xmath12 extended international system  @xcite ( see the topographic plot in the top panel of figure  [ fig : alltopo ] ) .",
    "the ground electrode was attached to _ fpz _ position and reference to the left earlobe respectively .",
    "no electromagnetic interference was observed from the vibrotactile transducers operating in higher frequencies comparing to the eeg frequency spectrum .",
    "details of the eeg experimental protocol are summarized in table  [ tb : p4 ] .",
    "the captured eeg signals were processed online by bci2000-based application  @xcite , using a stepwise linear discriminant analysis ( swlda ) classifier  @xcite with features drawn from the @xmath13  ms erp intervals . additionally in offline mode the classification accuracy was compared and improved using linear svm classifier  @xcite .",
    "the eeg recording sampling rate was set at @xmath14  hz , the high pass filter at @xmath15  hz , and the low pass filter at @xmath16  hz . the isi was @xmath17  ms , and each stimulus duration was @xmath1  ms .",
    "the subjects were instructed to spell out the number sequences ( corresponding to the interactive robotic application commands shown in table  [ tab : commands ] ) communicated by the transducers in each session .",
    "each @xmath18 was presented seven times in a single command trial .",
    "each subject performed three experimental sessions ( randomized @xmath19 and @xmath20 each ) , which were later averaged for the online swlda classifier case or treated as single trial ( only the first erp was used from a sequence of seven ) for linear svm , as discussed in a next section .",
    "the first online tbci session was a subject practice , the second was used for training the classifiers , while the last experimental session was used for testing interfacing accuracy .",
    "this section discusses the results obtained in the eeg online and offline data processing experiments , which are summarized in in table  [ tb : bpmr3 ] and figures  [ fig : alltopo ] ,  [ fig : allerp ] ,  [ fig : s3erp ] ,  and  [ fig : s2erp ] .",
    "all the participating in the study tbci subjects scored well above the chance level of @xmath21 , reaching an itr in the range from @xmath22  bit / min to @xmath23  bit / min in case of the online bci experiment with swlda classifier , which may be considered to be a good outcome for online vehicular robot driving experiments .",
    "the itr was calculated as follows  @xcite :",
    "@xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the number of bits / selection ; @xmath26 is the number of classes ( @xmath27 in this study ) ; @xmath28 is the classifier accuracy ( see table  [ tb : bpmr3 ] ) ; and @xmath29 is the classification speed in selections / minute ( @xmath30  selections / minute for this study in case of averaging of seven responses in online swlda case or @xmath31  selections / minute for the single trial based linear svm classifier ) .",
    "the maximum itr possible for the bci subjects to achieve in the settings presented were @xmath23  bit / min and @xmath32  bit / min , for seven averaged and single trial cases respectively .",
    "this case study demonstrated results obtained with a novel five  commands and chest locations based tbci paradigm developed and used in experiments with five `` body  able '' subjects .",
    "the proposed interface could be used for a real  time operation of the robotic vehicle .",
    "the experiment results obtained in this study confirmed the validity of the chest tbci for interactive applications and the possibility to further improve the results with utilization of the single trial based linear svm classifier .    the eeg experiment with the paradigm has confirmed that tactile stimuli can be used to operate robotic devices with five commands and with the interfacing rate ranging from @xmath22  bit / min to @xmath23  bit / min for online case using swlda and @xmath33  bit / min to @xmath34  bit / min in the offline post processing case with linear svm classifier respectively .",
    "the results presented offer a step forward in the development of novel neurotechnology applications . due to the still not very high interfacing rate achieved in online bci case among the subjects , the current paradigm would obviously need improvements and modifications to implement also online the proposed and tested offline linear svm classifier based processing .",
    "these needs determine the major lines of study for future research .",
    "however , even in its current form , the proposed tbci can be regarded as a practical solution for lis patients ( locked into their own bodies despite often intact cognitive functioning ) , who can not use vision or auditory based interfaces due to sensory or other disabilities .",
    "we plan to continue this line of the tactile bci research in order to further optimize the signal processing and machine learning ( classification ) methods .",
    "next we will test the paradigm with the lis patients in need for bci technology .",
