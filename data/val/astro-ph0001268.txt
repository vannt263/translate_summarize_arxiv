    "steinmetz & muller ( 1993 , hereafter sm93 ) have shown that in sph simulations at least @xmath0 sph particles are necessary to accurately follow local hydrodynamic evolution , in particular shocks and velocity fields .",
    "the simulation we discuss in this _",
    "letter _ is the first simulation of galaxy formation , we are aware of , to meet this criterion and also account for long range tidal fields .",
    "the tidal fields are incorporated by using the multiple mass technique ( porter 1985 ) .    to date ,",
    "the highest resolution studies of galaxy formation including long range tidal forces are those of navarro and steinmetz ( 1997 ) which used up to 5,000 gas particles per galaxy .",
    "these simulations were integrated to @xmath4 and required over 50,000 time - steps .",
    "although the particle number is comparatively low , the integration to @xmath4 is a significant achievement .",
    "the simulation presented here includes star formation and feedback using an algorithm tested in detail in thacker & couchman ( 1999 , hereafter tc99 ) .",
    "many authors believe ( white 1994 ) that feedback may solve both the cooling catastrophe ( white & frenk 1991 ) and the associated problem of core - halo angular momentum ( am ) transport ( navarro & benz 1991 ) .",
    "the morphological results for objects in this simulation are of great interest since we are able to probe smaller mass scales than previous investigations .",
    "this is particularly relevant in simulations with feedback since lower mass halos are more susceptible to perturbations produced by feedback .",
    "the bond & efstathiou ( 1984 ) cdm power spectrum was used to assign curvature perturbations in an einstein - de sitter universe , with cosmological parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , shape parameter @xmath8 and normalization @xmath9 .",
    "the perturbations were assigned to a low resolution @xmath10 dark - matter - only simulation of comoving width 48 mpc , at a redshift of @xmath11 .",
    "the simulation was evolved to @xmath12 using the adaptive p@xmath3 m algorithm of couchman ( 1991 ) , at which point a halo of mass @xmath13 was selected for re - simulation .",
    "the halo , which lies on a filament approximately 2 mpc long , does not have a violent merger history at this resolution and can be categorized as a being the halo of a field galaxy .",
    "the initial conditions of the high resolution simulation were prepared by creating four mass hierarchies in radial shells within the simulation volume .",
    "each shell has a width half that of the previous hierarchy , and the per - particle mass scales by a factor of 8 between each level , yielding a central high resolution region 6 mpc in comoving diameter .",
    "the mass in this region is @xmath14 , and a particle number of @xmath15523,535 gives particle masses of @xmath16 and @xmath17 for gas and dark matter respectively .",
    "the minimum ` glob ' and dark halo mass resolutions are 52 times higher , corresponding to the number of neighbors in the sph solver .",
    "only the high resolution region includes sph particles , which were given an initial temperature of 1,000 k. the effective resolution of the high resolution region is @xmath18 .",
    "the particle positions were drawn from a ` glass ' and the same power spectrum was used to assign modes to the particle distribution although the spectrum was truncated at the nyquist frequency of each hierarchy . in the high resolution simulation at @xmath12 the candidate halo",
    "is represented by about 220,000 particles , half dark matter and half gas .",
    "a plummer softening length of @xmath19 kpc was chosen and the minimum sph smoothing length was @xmath20 kpc .    in tc99 it was demonstrated that the temperature smoothing ( ts ) algorithm produces the most significant feedback effect .",
    "however , it was also observed that the ngc 6503 prototype was more affected by feedback than was the milky way prototype .",
    "hence , given the higher resolution in this simulation , the energy smoothing ( esa ) algorithm was adopted .",
    "the esa algorithm smooths @xmath21 erg g@xmath22 of feedback energy over the neighbor particles of an sph particle after a star formation event and allows this energy to persist for a time @xmath23 myr .",
    "given the higher densities resolved in the simulation the schmidt law sfr normalization was reduced by 30% compared to the low resolution runs in tc99 .",
    "a self - gravity criterion , also prevents star formation in regions where @xmath24 .",
    "it was not possible to integrate the simulation beyond @xmath25 due to inefficiencies developed in the sph algorithm as a result of the fixed minimum smoothing length employed .",
    "integration to this redshift required 4,100 time - steps ; approximately 37,000 would be required to @xmath4 . by @xmath25 40,777 star particles had been created ( 4% of the initial gas mass ) and @xmath26 kpc .",
    "the structure and evolution of the gas in the simulation is depicted in  4 .",
    "three notable stages of evolution are evident : ( i ) by @xmath27 , five gas cores have formed with masses between @xmath28  and @xmath29  and the associated dark halo masses are between @xmath30 and @xmath31 . a small fraction of the gas has been shocked to temperatures greater than 5,000 k , but otherwise adiabatic cooling due to expansion dominates ; ( ii ) by @xmath32 , well over 100 dark matter halos and globs are resolved .",
    "the largest dark matter halo at this epoch has a mass of @xmath33  and the associated glob @xmath34",
    ". between @xmath35 and @xmath32 , a large fraction of halos merge and it becomes clear that accretion on the central object is dominated by collapse along a filament in the z - direction .",
    "the hot gas halo begins developing at this epoch ; ( iii ) by @xmath25 , the hot halo has evolved significantly and has a central temperature close to @xmath36 k ( see section  [ halo ] ) .",
    "the largest dark matter halo has a mass of @xmath37 , while the largest glob has a mass of @xmath38 .      in our low resolution studies",
    "( tc99 ) disks form a very dense gas core , with a spatial extent smaller than @xmath39 , in nearly all simulations , the exception being the highly energetic temperature smoothing feedback .",
    "there is a clear trend toward higher specific angular momenta in the gas compared to dark matter with increased feedback .",
    "however , the effect is small when compared to that needed to produce observed spiral galaxy characteristics ( fall 1983 ) . increasing feedback , in an attempt to unbind the dense gas cores , lead to hot halo gas being unable to cool within a hubble time , thus rendering it unavailable for disk formation .",
    "the higher resolution in this simulation , in combination with hierarchical clustering , leads to the the gas overcoming the self - gravity criterion , and hence forming stars , at an earlier epoch ( @xmath32 ) than in the simulations of tc99 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "note that the 1.5 kpc resolution allows for density values that are 20 times higher than the simulations in tc99 .",
    "the dwarf systems formed here did not have the tight central gas core , observed in the lower resolution runs ( tc99 ) .",
    "the two largest dwarf systems contained over 30,000 and 20,000 gas particles respectively , before merging together at @xmath25 .",
    "visualization of the dwarfs shows that feedback causes small pockets of hot gas which remain static until the region reaches the end of the feedback period at which point the gas cools rapidly .",
    "there is little evidence for ` blow - out ' .    in  1 , the distribution of dark matter , gas and stars at @xmath25 is shown .",
    "the dark matter exhibits overmerging , which should be expected , given that the gravitational force is only resolved to @xmath41 .",
    "the dark matter is comparatively featureless while the gas shows a number of dense cores .",
    "the results of moore ( 1998 ) suggest that to avoid overmerging , a force resolution of @xmath42 is necessary , ten times smaller than that used here .",
    "the high mass resolution in the simulation allows us to resolve tidal tails extremely well .",
    "the viscosity of gas tends to accentuate the stripping effect , with collisionless matter being much less susceptible .",
    "an examination of the final state , shown in  1 , shows that the bulk of the gas objects merging with the central core are tidally stripped as they merge .",
    "the largest dwarf system develops a ring feature because an in - falling satellite becomes phase - wrapped as it accretes .",
    "1.z-projection of the dark matter , gas and stellar distributions in the main halo at @xmath25 .",
    "overmerging is apparent in the dark matter and it is not possible to associate halos directly with the stellar and gaseous features .      to analyze the growth of the specific angular momentum , @xmath43 , in the two largest dwarf systems , the z - component of @xmath43 was compared to the expected value of a flattened rotating disk of radius @xmath44 and circular velocity @xmath45 . for a disk system with radial orbits @xmath46 .",
    "the analysis was performed at @xmath47 since the dwarfs later coalesce . for both of the systems ,",
    "most of the gas and star particles have @xmath48 values marginally under the @xmath49 prediction , but do seem to follow the shape of the predicted curve reasonably well .",
    "this suggests that both of the disks have not yet lost a significant amount of angular momentum due to bar formation , although this is likely to occur .",
    "note that the two dwarfs have well - defined disks , albeit with a comparatively low aspect ratio since the disk thickness is about 1 kpc , while the diameter is about 4 kpc ( which is smaller than @xmath50 ) .",
    "analysis of the @xmath51 ( @xcite ) data show that both disks achieve stability at around a radius of 2 kpc , which must be considered sub - resolution .",
    "the same @xmath48 analysis was applied to the baryon condensation in the main halo at @xmath25 .",
    "although no clear disk is yet visible , visualization shows that a number of in - falling systems are orbiting in a similar plane .",
    "provided that these systems contribute the largest fraction of the orbital component of @xmath52 to the main halo , the dominant angular momentum component should be perpendicular to this plane .",
    "the data show that almost all the in - falling matter , picked out in the horizontal plane perpendicular to @xmath48 , has lost a significant proportion of angular momentum relative to the @xmath49 prediction . since no disk has formed , all of this angular momentum loss must be due to the core - halo transport mechanism .",
    "this result appears to show that at higher resolution the angular momentum loss is greater .",
    "however , caution should be emphasized in interpreting this result : if the selected matter just happens to be passing through the plane then its @xmath52 vector will not align well with that of the entire system and hence the @xmath48 analysis will overestimate the +    2.sfr integrated over the entire high resolution region . the higher mass resolution present in the simulation leads to a smoother sfr than the low resolution data ( the smoothed version is shown for comparison ) .",
    "points along the bottom of the plot are from code restarts and the small gap in the data is due to a log file being accidentally erased .",
    "loss of angular momentum .    at @xmath25 , the largest part of the specific angular momentum within @xmath53",
    "is carried by one system very close to @xmath53 .",
    "calculation of @xmath54 for the dark matter , gas cores and gas halo shows that all the values lies within a factor of two .",
    "however , recalculating these values within @xmath55 , removing the contribution from @xmath56 , shows markedly different results : the ratio of @xmath54 of the stars to dark matter is 0.19 , compared to values in the range 0.1 to 0.15 for the low resolution simulations at @xmath12 at @xmath53 in tc99 .",
    "hence the angular momentum loss in the core region is occurring earlier in this high resolution simulation .",
    "three red - shifts were selected for analysis , namely @xmath57 . to identify halos the ` friends of friends ' group - finding algorithm was employed .",
    "the linking length for dark matter was @xmath58 while for the baryons it was @xmath59 respectively for the different red - shifts , where @xmath60 is the average inter - particle spacing .",
    "the cumulative mass multiplicity functions for the dark matter and baryons are fit well by @xmath61 .",
    "this is shallower than the observed @xmath62 power law in evrard ( 1994 ) , but is in close agreement with the results of ghigna ( 1999 ) who derive a ( non - cumulative ) mass multiplicity function with power law slope @xmath63 in a galaxy cluster simulation .",
    "note , our results , and those of ghigna , are measured close to a density peak and are thus biased .",
    "further , the tilt in the power law can not be due to feedback blowing apart small baryon cores since both the dark matter and the baryons exhibit a similar slope .",
    "there is noticeably more evolution in the globs between @xmath32 and @xmath25 than there is for the dark matter halos , which is probably related to the rees - ostriker ( 1977 ) cooling criterion : prior to this epoch globs have not been able to cool .",
    "although gas cores are beginning to form at @xmath27 , none of them overcomes the self - gravity criterion until @xmath32 at which point star formation begins .",
    "the higher resolution in this simulation leads to an integrated sfr that is less burst - like than in the low resolution results of tc99 .",
    "the gradient of the sfr versus time is shallower than the lower resolution runs since the sfr normalization is lower .",
    "as is shown in the plot of sfr versus time in  2 , the peak sfr is reached at @xmath64 and is 80 .",
    "a linear scaling of the peak value suggests an sfr of over 100  would be attained if the low resolution sfr normalization from tc99 had been kept .",
    "the formation of the first star particles , and hence the first feedback events , occurred at @xmath65 which is only slightly earlier than the low resolution runs ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this is due to the lower sfr normalization .",
    "since there is no sudden drop in the sfr following the first feedback events , energy smoothing does not have a significant effect on the sfr at this resolution ( as compared to the results found in the low resolution temperature smoothing , and single particle feedback experiments ) .",
    "although the center of the dark halo is not completely relaxed at @xmath25 ( the dwarfs are merging ) it is still interesting to plot the radial density profile of the system since there is much interest in the shape of halo profiles ( @xcite ) .",
    "the densities of the dark matter and gas are shown in  3 .",
    "a fit of the dark matter to the moore profile is shown for reference and the fit is excellent . the averaged sph density ( not shown ) peaks about half an order of magnitude higher than the dark matter density .",
    "the self - gravity criterion is achieved out to 4@xmath67 , indicating that a large fraction of the condensing gas is available for star formation .",
    "the radial temperature profile is approximately flat , isothermal , with a temperature of @xmath68 k out to a radius of 150 kpc ( ignoring gas for which @xmath69 , which is assumed to be cold dense gas in dwarf systems ) .",
    "the temperature declines steeply at a radius of 250 kpc , where it falls from @xmath70 k to @xmath71 k. the sound crossing time is 0.03 gyr so the hot gas distribution has had time to relax . at the center of the halo the cooling times are close to 10 gyr , so cooling has little effect on the profile .",
    "the full three dimensional velocity dispersion for the dark matter within @xmath53 was found to be 163 .",
    "the average temperature for all of the gas within @xmath53 was @xmath72 k , while for the hot halo it was @xmath73 k. this leads to isothermal @xmath74 parameters of @xmath75=1.89 and @xmath76 .",
    "the value for the halo gas is lower than unity which is consistent with energy input from feedback .",
    "this _ letter _ has presented results for a simulation with sufficient mass resolution to accurately resolve shock structures within the forming galaxy . unfortunately , due to limitations in the simulation algorithm , it was necessary to truncate the evolution of the system at @xmath25 .",
    "the cooling catastrophe continues to be a significant problem .",
    "the dwarf galaxies , even those containing greater than @xmath71 gas particles , collapsed to a size close to the gravitational softening length of the simulation .",
    "however , the dwarfs did not exhibit a very tight central concentration of gas as observed in earlier low resolution models .",
    "even given the higher mass resolution in this simulation , esa feedback still does not cause +        \\2 .",
    "overmerging is still observed .",
    "including the baryons does not have any significant effect on this problem . in the core of the main halo",
    ", a number of the baryon cores do not have an accompanying dark matter halo .",
    "the core - halo angular momentum transport mechanism remains a serious problem .",
    "the star particles , which are formed from the gas cores , showed a noticeable loss of specific angular momentum relative to the dark matter at @xmath25 .",
    "the mass multiplicity function for both the dark matter halos and globs is well fit by an @xmath77 power law . although it is tempting to suggest this change is due to feedback reducing the number of low mass objects , this not the case .",
    "the higher resolution moved the onset of star formation to @xmath32 , compared to the @xmath78 epoch for the low resolution runs in tc99 .",
    "nonetheless @xmath32 is still later than some of the observations suggest .",
    "for example , chen ( 1999 ) report the possible identification of a star - forming galaxy at @xmath79 .",
    "the estimated star formation rate is 70 , assuming a flat , @xmath7 cosmology .",
    "given the simulation just presented , this result seems remarkable .",
    "even though the self - gravity criterion delays star formation until comparatively late times , it is difficult to see how , with the power spectrum used , such an object could be formed .",
    "the earlier onset of star formation can be achieved by adding more resolution or by using a power spectrum with a higher normalization . however , continuing to add resolution has limits since 100 times the current mass resolution would enable the jeans mass of the first objects in the cdm cosmology to be resolved , there is a limit to the cooling catastrophe .",
    "we note that the lyman break galaxies , characterized by masses of a few @xmath80 , and star formation rates of order 5 - 25 , are quite well approximated within the simulation .",
    "the two large dwarfs could conceivably be likened to these objects .",
    "changes are currently being made to our simulation algorithm and we hope to evolve this simulation further with the new code .",
    "nonetheless this simulation provides one particularly important result : even at a mass resolution of @xmath1 , a plausible feedback algorithm still fails to prevent the cooling catastrophe .",
