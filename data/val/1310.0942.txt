    "although the hartree - fock ( hf ) determinant is understood as variationally minimizing the energy , satisfaction of the self - consistent - field ( scf ) equations@xcite guarantees no more than a stationary point in the energy surface . in other words ,",
    "the energy is made invariant to any first - order variation of the spinorbitals in the slater determinant . to determine whether the energy is a local minimum , a local maximum , or a saddle point , examining the second - order variation is necessary@xcite .",
    "this problem was first discussed by overhauser@xcite in 1960 when he found an alternative lower - energy solution of an infinite linear system of fermions .",
    "the general conditions for the stability of the hf solutions were originally formulated by thouless@xcite and later developed by others@xcite .",
    "the hartree - fock stability test is related to the diagonalization of the molecular orbital ( mo ) hessian matrix .",
    "if the hessian is positive definite , the solution corresponds to at least a local minimum . if there is a negative eigenvalue , a lower energy solution can be found by proceeding initially in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector . when the lowest eigenvalue is identically zero , the story is more complicated .    often ( but not always ) , a lower energy solution found by the stability test breaks a physical symmetry , such as point group or spin .",
    "if the symmetry that has been broken is a continuous one - body symmetry , then the hessian matrix of the broken symmetry solution will have a zero eigenvalue , and the associated eigenvector will point in the direction required to restore that symmetry@xcite .",
    "more precisely , it will point towards another determinant in the so  called goldstone manifold associated with the broken symmetry , where the goldstone manifold consists of other determinants which have broken the same symmetry .",
    "the various determinants in the goldstone manifold are degenerate , non - orthogonal ( in finite systems ) , and can be connected by a rotation with a continuous parameter . diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the basis of these determinants restores the symmetry@xcite . if the symmetry that has been broken is instead discrete ( such as complex conjugation ) , then the hessian matrix of the broken symmetry solution will not have a zero - energy eigenvector pointing in the direction of symmetry restoration .",
    "nonetheless , a set of degenerate and non - orthogonal states which have broken the same symmetry in different ways can be found and the hamiltonian can be diagonalized in this basis to restore the symmetry .",
    "unlike in the case of continuous symmetries , however , these degenerate and non - orthogonal states can not be reached by a rotation with a continuous parameter . while the hessian matrix of a stable but broken - symmetry hartree - fock wave function will have zero eigenvalues ,",
    "the converse is not always true : zero eigenvalues of the hessian matrix do not necessarily indicate broken - symmetry hartree - fock solutions .",
    "we find it convenient to classify the zero - energy eigenvectors of the mo hessian in terms of modes associated with genuine zero - energy excitations due to degeneracies on the one - hand , and modes which do not correspond to legitimate zero - energy excitations on the other .",
    "we refer to zero - energy excitations as `` legitimate '' if there exists a set of quantum numbers for which degenerate states are expected in the exact solution .",
    "for example , a triplet wave function has a triply - degenerate ground state and therefore two legitimate zero - energy excitations .",
    "legitimate zero - energy excitations also occur in the thermodynamic limit , where they allow for the appearance of classical behavior .",
    "artifactual symmetry breaking , on the other hand , arises from approximations .",
    "unrestricted hartree - fock , for example , sacrifices good quantum numbers in favor of a variationally superior energy , thereby signalling the appearance of near degeneracies and predicting the failure of symmetry - adapted mean - field methods . in these cases , projectively restoring the symmetry lowers the energy .",
    "there is a close relation between the hartree - fock stability problem and the random phase approximation ( rpa)@xcite . an instability in the hartree - fock wave function may lead to a mode with imaginary energy in rpa .",
    "when the hessian has a zero eigenvalue , so too does rpa .",
    "these zero - energy eigenvectors play a crucial role in rpa .",
    "when a hermitian one - body symmetry is broken , the rpa develops zero eigenvalues which are due not to an intrinsic excitation of the system but to a motion without a restoring force .",
    "the corresponding rpa eigenvector is called a spurious mode .",
    "nuclear physicists have studied spurious modes associated with different types of symmetry breaking , such as translation , rotation and so on,@xcite but the quantum chemistry community has paid relatively little attention to the different physical reasons for zero eigenvalues in the hartree - fock stability problem @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the zero - energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the general hartree - fock spinorbital hessian and the associated rpa problem , aided by the detailed discussion of the zero - energy modes of quadratic bosonic hamiltonians given by colpa in refs . .",
    "we extend this analysis to draw a more detailed analogy with the symmetries of the mean - field wave function and prove certain matrix - algebraic relations that allow us to shed some light on the zero - energy modes . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first detailed study of this problem in the quantum chemistry community .",
    "our motivation for embarking in this study is the relevance of zero energy modes in symmetry breaking and restoration , a subject that has recently received much of our attention@xcite .",

    "the classification of the symmetries of the electronic hamiltonian within the born - oppenheimer approximation was first carried out by fukutome @xcite and recently reviewed and extended to include restricted open shells by stuber and paldus @xcite .",
    "it is not our intention to discuss this classification extensively , but merely to note which symmetries we must concern ourselves with .",
    "typical electronic structure hamiltonians are invariant to spin rotations , so that @xmath0 is a ( two - body ) symmetry . in addition to @xmath1 symmetry ,",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant to spin rotations around all arbitrarily chosen axes ( _ i.e. _ invariant to @xmath2 for all axes @xmath3 ) . because the operators @xmath2 and @xmath4 do not commute with each other",
    ", we must pick some axis to privilege ; by convention , we take this to be the @xmath5 axis so that the wave function has good quantum numbers @xmath6 and @xmath7 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath8 of @xmath0 and @xmath7 corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "hartree - fock wave functions which respect both these symmetries are known as restricted hartree - fock ( rhf ) or , if open - shell , restricted open - shell hartree - fock ( rohf ) . a hartree - fock determinant which respects @xmath9 symmetry but not @xmath0 symmetry",
    "is known as unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) , while a determinant which breaks both and allows each spinorbital to be a linear combination of up - spin and down - spin functions is known as generalized hartree - fock ( ghf ) .",
    "note that any uhf solution can be converted into a ghf solution by a global spin rotation ( so that the determinant respects @xmath2 symmetry for some axis other than the @xmath5 axis ) .",
    "we define `` true '' ghf solutions as determinants which can not be converted to uhf via global spin rotation , so that there is _ no _ axis of spin quantization for which the wave function is an eigenfunction .",
    "these spin symmetries are all continuous symmetries in the language above",
    ".    distinct from spin symmetry are complex conjugation and time reversal symmetries , both of which are discrete and antiunitary , meaning that we can not associate good quantum numbers with them @xcite . additionally , the hamiltonian commutes with the number operator so that the electronic wave function has a definite number of particles .",
    "while number symmetry can be broken in the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) mean - field approximation , it is never broken in hartree - fock ( by definition ) .",
    "moreover hfb and hf coincide for coulombic systems so we do not consider number symmetry further .",
    "many molecules , finally , have point group symmetry , which may be either discrete or continuous , depending on the point group involved .",
    "point group symmetry , like spin symmetry , is unitary , and can be associated with good quantum numbers .",
    "suppose we have a reference single determinant @xmath10 which we construct from a set of occupied spinorbitals which we label by @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ,  .",
    "we will also have virtual spinorbitals labeled by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ,  which , together with the occupied orbitals , form a complete single - particle space .",

    "note also that we will refer to a hartree - fock state as stable if the hessian is positive semi - definite .      in the random phase approximation one seeks excitation operators @xmath32 whose equation of motion delivers the excitation energies of the system of interest , via @xmath33 |\\mathrm{rpa}\\rangle = \\omega_\\nu \\hat{q}{}^\\dagger_v |\\mathrm{rpa}\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the excitation energy .",
    "if one assumes that the rpa ground state @xmath35 is the hf determinant @xmath10 in what is known as the quasi - boson approximation@xcite , one obtains the excitation energies and corresponding excitation operators from solving a non - hermitian eigenvalue problem @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38    in the quasi - boson approximation , the rpa problem is fully determined by the hessian matrix of the underlying hf solution .",
    "in particular , since the eigenvalues of eqn .",
    "[ eq : rpa ] have the physical meaning of excitation energies , they must be real .",
    "this can be guaranteed if the matrix @xmath39 is positive semidefinite , and hence the underlying hf solution is stable .",
    "we emphasize that the opposite is not necessarily true : even if the hessian @xmath39 has negative eigenvalues , the rpa matrix @xmath40 may have only real eigenvalues . in other words , real rpa eigenvalues do not guarantee that the hessian is positive semidefinite@xcite .",
    "for example , in equilateral h@xmath41 the uhf hessian has a negative eigenvalue pointing toward ghf but the uhf - based rpa has only real eigenvalues .    in the rest of the paper we shall focus only on the zero eigenvalues of @xmath39 , which connect the stability and rpa problems in an even more subtle way , as clearly all zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath39 are also zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath40 .",
    "the structure of the hessian @xmath39 of eqn . [ eq : defhessian ] means that we can always write its eigenvectors in the form @xmath42 indeed , we _ must _ do so in order to cast the eigenvector as an orbital rotation .",
    "note that @xmath43 , a condition which we will refer to as a vanishing @xmath44-norm .",
    "we emphasize for clarity that hessian eigenvectors can have non - zero @xmath44-norm when not written in the form given in eqn .",
    "[ eq : hesvec ] , but they then no longer correspond to search directions for orbital mixing .",
    "meanwhile , the symplectic character of the rpa matrix @xmath40 guarantees that if @xmath45 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath46 , then @xmath47 is an eigenvector with eigenvalue @xmath48 .",
    "note that this means that @xmath49 must have an even number of zero eigenvalues whereas no such restriction applies to @xmath39 itself .",
    "thus , while all zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath40 are also zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath39 and _ vice versa _ , the multiplicity of their corresponding eigenvalues may or may not be the same .",
    "we are thus faced with the task of classifying the zero - energy eigenvectors of rpa . in this",
    ", we are guided by the discussion of colpa @xcite .",
    "one can classify the zero - energy eigenvectors of rpa as `` proper '' or `` improper '' modes and can determine the number of each type by studying the spectra of @xmath39 and @xmath49 .    the proper modes @xmath50 are zero - energy eigenvectors of the rpa problem that correspond to legitimate excited states with zero excitation energies .",
    "in particular , there exists a physical state @xmath51 the requirement that we can normalize this state in the quasiboson approximation implies that @xmath52 where @xmath53 . in other words , @xmath54 has an @xmath44-norm of 1 .",
    "proper modes have a counterpart eigenvector @xmath55 which is also a zero - energy eigenvector of the rpa matrix but which has an @xmath44-norm of @xmath56 .",
    "as we prove in appendix [ app : norms ] , it is always possible to form a linear combination of proper modes to obtain valid orbital rotations with vanishing @xmath44-norm .",
    "note that because @xmath54 and @xmath57 are distinct zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath40 , they are both zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath39 as well , though not necessarily in the form desired .",
    "the situation is drastically different for the improper modes @xmath58 . like the proper modes , it is possible to cast the improper modes as valid orbital rotations .",
    "however , improper modes lack a degenerate counterpart .",
    "thus , the states @xmath59 are not normalizable in the sense of eqn .",
    "[ eq : eta - norm ] .",
    "because the improper mode lacks a degenerate counterpart , it corresponds to a _",
    "zero eigenvalue of the hessian matrix even though it leads to _ two _ zero eigenvalues of the rpa problem .",
    "in other words , an improper mode has one linearly independent eigenvector of @xmath49 corresponding to an eigenvalue with multiplicity two ; the rpa matrix is defective , not diagonalizable .",
    "when a system has multiple improper modes , they are all what we will term @xmath44-orthogonal , which means that we have @xmath60 for all @xmath61 pairs .",
    "note that proper modes , when cast in the form of vectors with vanishing @xmath44-norm so that they are valid orbital rotations , are _ not _ @xmath44-orthogonal .",
    "these properties allow one to count the number of the proper and improper zero modes simply by investigating the spectrum of the hessian matrix and the rpa problem . denoting the number of proper modes as @xmath62 and improper as @xmath11",
    ", the number of zero eigenvalues of @xmath39 must be @xmath63 , while there are @xmath64 zero eigenvalues of @xmath40 .",
    "note that the proper modes `` physically '' have a degeneracy of @xmath65 , essentially because the physically meaningful eigenvectors of the rpa problem have positive @xmath44-norm .    for more rigorous discussion of the properties of the improper modes ,",
    "the reader is referred to appendix [ app : norms ] and to ref . .",
    "in the following section , we will show that hf wave functions that break continuous symmetries of the underlying hamiltonian lead to an rpa problem with zero modes .",
    "moreover , the occupied - virtual block of the representation of the generator of the broken symmetry corresponds to the zero eigenvector of the rpa matrix .",
    "the discussion below closely follows refs . and .",
    "suppose that @xmath66 is a hermitian one - body operator which commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "from @xmath66 we can form a unitary operator @xmath67 , with @xmath68 a continuous parameter . because @xmath66 is a one - body operator , it acts to rotate a reference determinant @xmath10 to another determinant @xmath69 . because @xmath66 commutes with the hamiltonian , the expectation values of @xmath70 with respect to @xmath10 and with respect to @xmath71 are the same .",
    "we thus see that if @xmath10 is a solution of the hartree - fock equations , so too is @xmath71 .",

    "thus , for any broken single - particle continuous symmetry there will be a zero - energy eigenvector of the rpa problem .",
    "if the symmetry is not broken , in fact , the foregoing still holds but @xmath83 identically vanishes .",
    "unfortunately , these considerations alone do not allow one to identify the nature of the zero - energy eigenvector .",
    "to do so , one must investigate the @xmath44-orthogonality relations among the broken symmetry generators .",
    "note also that , depending on the system studied , a given symmetry operator may yield a proper or an improper mode .    in order to illustrate this idea a little better ,",
    "let us consider uhf determinants .",
    "we can not consider @xmath0 directly in this context because @xmath0 is a two - body symmetry , which would lead to zeros in the two - particle two - hole rpa.@xcite however , we can consider @xmath84 and @xmath85 , both of which are symmetries of the hamiltonian and both of which are broken whenever the uhf is not a spin eigenfunction with @xmath86 .",
    "as we show with more detail in appendix [ app : spin ] , for a uhf determinant which breaks spin symmetry , @xmath84 and @xmath85 yield a pair of zero - energy modes in rpa . when the uhf determinant has @xmath87 , these two generators yield two improper modes , but when @xmath88 , they instead yield a single proper mode which is then doubled .",
    "similar arguments have recently been offered in rationalizing the number of nambu - goldstone bosons in nonrelativistic theories.@xcite we should emphasize that of course the wave function can not be a simultaneous eigenfunction of @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath9 except in the trivial case when it is an eigenfunction of @xmath0 with @xmath86 .",
    "but while picking a preferred spin axis may be physically correct , symmetry breaking it remains .    in the case of a discrete symmetry ,",
    "even though one could still find a set of degenerate hartree - fock states , there is no continuous parameter @xmath68 which generates a continuum of degenerate states ; the foregoing argument then no longer holds .      we shall now attempt to connect the improper modes in the rpa with symmetry restoration",
    "given an eigenvector @xmath75 of the hessian matrix with zero eigenvalue associated with an improper mode , one can always find an associated vector @xmath89 @xcite defined by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a constant which can be completely determined by imposing the normalization conditions @xmath92 in its diagonal form , the rpa bosonic hamiltonian @xcite can then be written in terms of the kinetic energy mode of a free - particle with the form @xmath93 , where @xmath94 where @xmath95 stands for the set of bosonic annihilation operators .",
    "the kinetic energy ( inversely proportional to the mass @xmath96 recovered from eqn . [ defq ] ) associated with such a mode has a direct connection with the correlation energy obtained by symmetry - projection schemes . indeed , if an approximate symmetry - projection is used instead of a full projection ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the kamlah expansion discussed in detail in refs . )",
    "then the correlation energy is expressed in terms of kinetic energy contributions of the same form as those obtained at the rpa level .",
    "if @xmath75 is , on the other hand , a proper mode , an associated vector @xmath89 does not exist@xcite .",
    "this is just a reflection of the fact that proper modes do not render the bosonic hamiltonian defective , as discussed previously .",
    "hence , at the rpa level , the proper modes are described as true zero - energy excitations rather than as free particles with an associated kinetic energy .",
    "one should bear in mind that , if a mode is proper , that does not mean that full symmetry - restoration of the associated operator will not lower the energy . in the case of spin , if the reference determinant is an eigenfunction of @xmath9 ( uhf ) with eigenvalue different from @xmath97 , then one can always diagonalize the hamiltonian in the goldstone manifolds generated by @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "a lower energy may be obtained if the original uhf state was not an eigenfunction of the total spin ( @xmath0 ) operator .",
    "in this section , we present some pedagogical examples including both atomic and molecular systems to show the difference between proper and improper modes . we have counted and analyzed the number of the zero eigenvalues of the hessian @xmath39 ( @xmath63 ) as well as the rpa matrix @xmath40 ( @xmath64 ) in order to calculate the number of proper ( @xmath62 ) and improper ( @xmath11 ) zero modes according to the method we discussed in sec.[sec : zero modes ] .",

    "just as with the beryllium atom , there are three improper modes , and for the same reason .      in case iii , we consider systems that have both proper and improper zero modes , though not necessarily together at the same geometry .",
    "we focus on the molecule , asymmetric dissociation and dissociation .",
    "we should also emphasize that when multiple symmetries are broken simultaneously , or when we have both proper and improper modes simultaneously , it is far from trivial to assign modes to symmetries simply because the diagonalization of the hessian and the rpa matrix will mix modes together .    * molecule .",
    "* we start with the molecule , varying the h - c - h angle between 80@xmath106 and 100@xmath106 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ch2 ] .",
    "when the bond angle is less than @xmath107 87@xmath108 , the uhf singlet is the stable solution . for bond angles greater than @xmath107 89@xmath108 degrees ,",
    "the triplet is instead the stable solution . for angles between 87@xmath108 and 89@xmath108 , both the singlet and triplet display eigenvalues which are numerically zero to the tolerance of our calculation .",
    "both the singlet and triplet states have two zero modes since the uhf solutions break @xmath84 and @xmath85 symmetries . however , these modes are proper for the triplet ground state and improper for the singlet ground state , as we would expect .",
    "* asymmetric dissociation of . *",
    "now , let us turn to the dissociation of into an oxygen atom and , where in the latter the bond length is fixed at 1.16   throughout the dissociation process .",
    "figure [ fig : co2 ] shows that near equilibrium ( @xmath109 1.63  ) , the rhf is the stable ground state with zeros neither in the hessian nor the rpa matrix . stretching the bond leads to a spin rotation so that the correct dissociation limit can be reached along the @xmath110 surface . during this spin rotation ,",
    "a true ghf solution exists ( 1.64 @xmath111 1.79  ) . as in our previous ghf examples , there are three improper modes , corresponding to the three broken spin degrees of freedom . in the region",
    "@xmath112 1.80  , the uhf triplet state becomes stable with two proper zero modes and one improper mode .",
    "the two proper zeros correspond to spin , as the uhf has @xmath87 .",
    "the improper mode comes from breaking the rotational symmetry of the molecule . to demonstrate this",
    ", we change the o - c - o bond angle to 170@xmath106 , eliminating the rotational symmetry of the molecule .",
    "when we do so , the improper mode disappears .",
    "* dissociation of . *",
    "our last example corresponds to the dissociation of the molecule . in its ground state ,",
    "the molecule is a triplet , dissociating to a pair of triplet atoms . at the hartree - fock level",
    ", a triplet can only be described with @xmath113 ; the @xmath104 component of the triplet is a two - determinant wave function .",
    "the result is that uhf can not describe the dissociation of triplet to two triplet atoms . instead",
    ", the proper dissociation limit is reached on the singlet and quintet curves .",
    "we therefore examine singlet , triplet , and quintet uhf states , as shown in figure [ fig : o2 ] .",
    "as the preceeding discussion implies , both the singlet and quintet curves cross the triplet during the uhf dissociation process , though the singlet has lower energy . the ghf curve ( not shown in figure [ fig : o2 ] )",
    "agrees with the most stable uhf at all points except for a small region ( 1.45 @xmath111 1.47  ) where the uhf singlet and triplet cross and a true ghf solution connects the two via spin rotation@xcite . to be more clear , the triplet uhf solution ( @xmath110 ) is stable in the region @xmath114  , the singlet ( @xmath87 ) for @xmath115  , and the quintet ( @xmath116 ) for @xmath117  .",
    "interestingly , as we see in table [ tab : results ] , the number of proper and improper zero modes varies from case to case .    for uhf triplet and quintet stable solutions whose expectation values of @xmath9 are 1 and 2 , respectively , there are two proper modes coming from spin symmetry breaking . in contrast , the uhf singlet state has two improper modes arising from spin symmetry breaking , as one would expect . in the region where a ghf solution exists ,",
    "we see two proper and one improper modes .",
    "we believe that this is because , unlike with our other ghf examples , one can not make the expectation value of the spin vector vanish and there must be a preferred direction of spin .",
    "another observation that can be drawn from table [ tab : results ] is that there is another improper mode appearing in all situations where the bond length is larger than 1.2  .",
    "presumably , this improper mode arises from breaking the rotational symmetry along the o - o bond axis , as happened in , although of course we can not break the d@xmath118 symmetry of the molecular hamiltonian to test this .",
    "while the hartree - fock molecular orbital hessian has a zero eigenvalue whenever a continuous one - body symmetry has been broken , the existence of zero eigenvalues in the hessian does not imply that symmetry breaking has taken place .",
    "some zero eigenvalues are associated with genuine degeneracies of the physical hamiltonian ; many others appear to be mere artifacts of the mean - field approximation",
    ". there may be additional zero modes related to the appearance of gauge or quasi - symmetries.@xcite zero modes can be classified as proper or improper .",
    "improper zero modes seem to be related to artifactual symmetry breaking , but individual proper modes may or may not be .",
    "fortunately , one can distinguish proper from improper modes by counting the number of zero eigenvalues of the related rpa matrix .",
    "generally , the zero - energy rpa excitation associated with an improper zero mode of the hessian is artifactual , while the zero - energy rpa excitations associated with proper zero modes of the hessian may be physically significant . for example , as we stretch , the hessian acquires improper zero modes past the coulson - fischer point and thus zero - energy excitations in rpa which are not present in the exact solution of the schrdinger equation . at dissociation ,",
    "as discussed in appendix [ app : spin ] , the hessian instead has only proper modes and the zero - energy excitations in rpa become physically meaningful as the true ground state is quadruply degenerate .",
    "when the zero modes are due to symmetry breaking , the symmetry can be projectively restored .",
    "improper modes are particularly important in this regard , as even an approximate symmetry restoration lowers the energy when the modes are improper .",
    "we believe that the present discussion of the zero modes of the hessian and the rpa problem will be of interest to the quantum chemistry community , particularly in light of the role the goldstone manifold plays in projective symmetry restoration@xcite .",
    "this work was supported by the national science foundation ( che-1102601 ) and the welch foundation ( c-0036 ) .",
    "in the following appendix , we shall prove the @xmath44-orthogonality relations among zero - energy eigenvectors of rpa which allow us to distinguish between proper and improper modes .",
    "the discussion included here is general .",
    "we apply this formalism to the spin operators in appendix [ app : spin ]",
    ". it may be helpful to be familiar with ref .",
    ", which proves the results we rely on here .",
    "we begin by noting that when the hessian matrix @xmath39 of eqn .",
    "[ eq : defhessian ] is positive semi - definite , then according to theorem 3.10 of ref .",
    "there exists a matrix @xmath119 satisfying @xmath120 and @xmath121 , such that @xmath122 here @xmath123 , is real , positive , and diagonal , @xmath124 is hermitian , @xmath125 is symmetric , and the hermitian submatrix @xmath126 is such that @xmath127 has only zero eigenvalues .",
    "there are several points we should make about this transformation .",
    "first , while @xmath39 and @xmath128 have different eigenvalues , note that if @xmath129 is a zero - energy eigevector of @xmath39 , then @xmath130 is a zero - energy eigenvector of @xmath128 .",
    "this implies that the zero eigenvalues of @xmath39 derive _ only _ from @xmath131 .",
    "this , in turn , means that the number of zero eigenvalues of @xmath40 is the same as the dimension of @xmath131 and that the zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath131 can be used to obtain those of @xmath40 .",
    "let us thus investigate the spectrum of @xmath131 . by lemma b.4 of ref .",
    ", the ( orthonormal ) eigenvectors of @xmath131 can be chosen as the union of two disjoint sets @xmath132 and @xmath133 . where    @xmath134    where @xmath64 is clearly the dimension of @xmath131 .",
    "note that because the eigenvectors of @xmath131 are orthonormal , we have    @xmath135    [ pinorm ]",
    "the important point is that _ all _ eigenvectors in the set @xmath132 and only _ half _ of the eigenvectors in the set @xmath133 are zero - energy eigenvectors of @xmath131 .",
    "the remaining eigenvectors in @xmath133 have instead positive eigenvalues .",
    "in particular , if @xmath136 is a zero - energy eigenvector , then @xmath137 corresponds to a positive eigenvalue .",
    "it should be clear that the set @xmath132 consists of the proper modes and @xmath133 of the improper modes . from now on we will assume that the improper modes are all written as @xmath138 , which we can always arrange by multiplying by @xmath139 as needed .",
    "having identified eigenvectors of @xmath131 , we can read off the corresponding eigenvectors of @xmath128",
    ". in particular , if @xmath140 is a proper zero - energy eigenvector of @xmath131 , then we have @xmath141 and @xmath142 likewise , if @xmath143 is an improper zero - energy eigenvector of @xmath131 , then we have @xmath144    all of this means that we can find the proper and improper eigenvectors of @xmath39 itself , using the relation @xmath145 which as we have already noted holds for the zero - energy eigenvectors .",
    "we can then check the @xmath44-norm of @xmath146 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "generically , we have @xmath149 where we have used @xmath150 .",
    "one finds    @xmath151    where we have used the normalization relations of eqn .",
    "[ pinorm ] .",
    "similarly , one can readily show that @xmath152 , @xmath153 , and @xmath154 are mutually @xmath44-orthogonal : @xmath155 note that in terms of the block structure for @xmath128 , we would have @xmath156    we therefore see that proper modes can be chosen to have non - zero @xmath44-norm while improper modes can not .",
    "we can of course create proper modes with zero @xmath44-norm so that they have the correct structure to be an orbital rotation by defining , for example , @xmath157 , but one can easily show that these modes are then not @xmath44-orthogonal . from the context of orbital rotations ,",
    "that is , both proper and improper modes have zero @xmath44-norm but improper modes are @xmath44-orthogonal while proper modes are not .",
    "note finally that the @xmath44-normalized proper modes appear in pairs @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "as we have shown in sec . [ sec : theory ] , a broken continuous one - body symmetry leads to a zero - energy eigenvector of the hessian , taking the general form @xmath160 where @xmath83 is a vector consisting of the occupied - virtual elements of the symmetry generator @xmath66 .",
    "we can cast this vector as a valid orbital rotation by multiplying by @xmath161 . as an orbital rotation",
    ", this vector has zero @xmath44-norm .",
    "it thus follows from our discussion in appendix [ app : norms ] that if @xmath129 is to correspond to a proper mode , there must be a second zero - energy eigenvector @xmath162 which also has zero @xmath44-norm but which is not @xmath44-orthogonal to @xmath129 .",
    "suppose , then , that the underlying hartree - fock state is uhf in nature , so that it has broken @xmath0 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 symmetry but not @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "we can define eigenvectors correspond to @xmath84 and @xmath85 symmetry breaking :        @xmath164 \\\\   & = \\sum_{ia } \\left[\\mathbf{s}^x_{ai } \\mathbf{s}^y_{ia } - \\mathbf{s}^x_{ia } \\mathbf{s}^y_{ai}\\right ] \\\\   & = \\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\mathbf{s}^y_{ov } \\mathbf{s}^x_{vo } - \\mathbf{s}^x_{ov } \\mathbf{s}^y_{vo}\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where in the last line we have converted @xmath165 and @xmath166 from vectors to matrices . using the cyclic properties of the trace , we can add and subtract @xmath167 to get @xmath168 this we recognize as      thus , when @xmath170 , the modes corresponding to breaking @xmath84 and @xmath85 in uhf are improper .",
    "otherwise , they are proper .",
    "similarly , for a ghf reference , when @xmath171 , all three modes are improper ; otherwise , one is improper and two are proper .    finally , note that the analysis above holds only when the hessian has only two zero eigenvalues for uhf or three for ghf .",
    "the improper modes become proper if the hessian has additional zero modes which are not @xmath44-orthogonal to them ; the proper modes , of course , remain proper .",
    "this is the case for the dissociation of h@xmath172 , for example . as we have already seen , the hessian has two improper modes ( so the rpa matrix has four zero eigenvalues ) .",
    "as the bond stretches , the next lowest two eigenvalues of the hessian approach zero , and at dissociation both the hessian and the rpa matrix have four zero eigenvalues , indicating that they correspond to proper modes .",
    "this is as we would expect , since each of the two non - interacting hydrogen atoms has two proper modes ."
