    "magnetic moments are an important fundamental property of particles .",
    "they determine dynamical response of a bound system to external perturbations , and provide valuable insight into internal strong interaction structure .",
    "there are at least two ways to extract the magnetic moment .",
    "one is from form factors ( three - point functions ) where an extrapolation to @xmath1 is required .",
    "the other is the external field method using only two - point functions  @xcite .",
    "here we report a calculation in the latter .",
    "it is an extension of our work on electric and magnetic polarizabilities  @xcite .    in order to place a magnetic field on the lattice",
    ", we construct an analogy to the continuum case .",
    "the fermion action is modified by the minimal coupling prescription @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the charge of the fermion field and @xmath4 is the vector potential describing the external field . on the lattice ,",
    "the prescription amounts to a modified link variable @xmath5 . choosing @xmath6 , a constant magnetic field b can be introduced in the @xmath7-direction",
    ". then the phase factor is @xmath8 on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions , to get a constant magnetic field , b has to be quantized by the condition @xmath9 to ensure that the magnetic flux through plaquettes in the xy - plane is contant .",
    "however , for @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the lowest field would give the proton a mass shift of about 390 mev , which is too large ( the proton is severely distorted ) .",
    "we abandon the quantization condition and choose to work with smaller fields . to minimize the boundary effects , we work with fixed ( or dirichlet ) b.c . in the x - direction and large @xmath12 , so that quarks originating in the middle of the lattice have little chance of propagating to the edge .",
    "we use @xmath0 lattice at @xmath13 , and six kappa values @xmath14=0.1515 , 0.1535 , 0.1545 , 0.1555 , corresponding to pion mass of 1015 , 908 , 794 , 732 , 667 , 522 mev .",
    "the strange quark mass is set at @xmath14=0.1535 .",
    "the souce location is ( x , y , z , t)=(12,1,1,2 ) .",
    "we analyzed 87 configurations .",
    "the following five dimensionless numbers @xmath15=+0.00036 , -0.00072 , + 0.00144 , -0.00288 , + 0.00576 give four small b fields at @xmath16=-0.00108 , + 0.00216 , -0.00432 , + 0.00864 for both u and d ( or s ) quarks .",
    "note that `` small '' here is in the sense that the mass shift is only a fraction of the proton mass : @xmath17 0.6 to 4.8% at the smallest pion mass . in absolute terms , @xmath18 tesla .",
    "the mass shift in the presence of small fields can be expanded as a polynomial in b , @xmath19 to eliminate the contamination from the even - power terms , we calculate mass shifts both in the field @xmath20 and its reverse @xmath21 , then take the difference and divide by 2 .",
    "so our calcaulation is equivalent to 11 separate spectrum calculations : 5 orignal @xmath22 values , 5 reversed , plus the one at zero field to set the baseline . for a dirac particle of spin @xmath23 in uniform fields , @xmath24 where the upper sign means spin up and the lower sign means spin - down , and @xmath25 .",
    "we tried the following three methods to extract the g factors , and found they are equivalent within statistical errors .",
    "@xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 the results quoted are from eq .",
    "fig .  [ octp_linear_shift ] displays a typical mass shift as a function of the field for the proton .",
    "there is good linear behavior going through the origin , an indication that contamination from the higher terms has been effectively eliminated .",
    "we only use the two smallest field values to do the linear fit .",
    "[ mag_pn ] shows the results for the proton and the neutron .",
    "the line is a simple chiral fit using the ansatz @xmath29 a more advanced chiral extrapolation could be carried out , using , for example , the prescription in ref .",
    "@xcite . fig .",
    "[ mag_osig ] to fig .",
    "[ mag_dxi ] show the results for other particles .",
    "the agreement with experiment for the @xmath30 is encouraging since no extrapolation is needed for this point .",
    "the experimental value for @xmath31 ( slightly shifted for better view ) is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . finally , fig .",
    "[ mag_pdecdp ] shows the proton and @xmath31 together .",
    "the opposite curvatures are a signature of quenched chiral physics .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed by  @xcite using the form factor method ."
