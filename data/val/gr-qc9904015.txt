    "a spherical gravitational wave antenna ideally has equal sensitivity to gravitational waves from all directions and polarizations and is able to determine the directional information and tensorial character of a gravitational wave .",
    "the solution for the inverse problem for a noiseless antenna has been known for some time @xcite , and an analytic solution for an noisy antenna was recently found @xcite .",
    "these solutions are quite elegant as they only require linear algebra to estimate the wave direction and polarization from the detector outputs .    by monitoring the five quadrupole modes of an elastic sphere",
    ", one has a direct measurement of the effective force of a gravitational wave on the sphere @xcite .",
    "the standard technique for doing so on resonant detectors is to position resonant transducers on the surface of the sphere that strongly couple to the quadrupole modes .",
    "a number of proposals have been made for the type and positions of the transducers @xcite .",
    "what all of these proposals have in common is that the outputs of the transducers are combined into five `` mode channels '' @xmath0 that are constructed to have a one - to - one correspondence with the quadrupole modes of the sphere and thus the spherical amplitudes of the gravitational wave  @xcite .",
    "the mode channels @xmath1 can be collected to form a `` detector response '' matrix    @xmath2 ,     \\label{eqn : cartesian_strain_tensor}\\ ] ]    which , in the absence of noise in the detector , is equal to the gw strain tensor , expressed in lab frame coordinates .",
    "the latter tensor has the canonical form    @xmath3 ,     \\label{eqn : wave_strain}\\ ] ]    in the wave frame , and is related to @xmath4 by an orthogonal transformation a rotation .",
    "@xmath5 clearly has an eigenvector , @xmath6 , say , with zero eigenvalue which corresponds to the wave propagation direction .",
    "the same therefore applies to @xmath4 , and this enables the determination of the wave direction by a straightforward algebraic procedure directly from detector data : it is the eigenvector of @xmath4 with null eigenvalue .",
    "things change when the detector is noisy : noise gets added to the signal in the mode channels , destroying the equivalence between the data matrix @xmath4 and the signal matrix @xmath5 .",
    "however , it has been shown that under ideal conditions of the noise a modified version of the above procedure can be used @xcite : the eigenvector of the noisy @xmath4 with eigenvalue _ closest to zero _ is the _",
    "best _ approximation to the actual incidence direction of the gravitational wave .    in this paper we shall be taking an _ analytic _",
    "approach to the diagonalization problem , whereby errors in the estimated gw parameters can be assessed to any desired degree of accuracy .",
    "inherent in this approach is the unambiguous definition of the incidence direction estimate , as well as a cartesian coordinate convention for it , which rids us of the ambiguities intrinsically associated to the euler angle characterization for incidence directions near the poles .",
    "errors in these quantities will be shown to be incidence direction independent .",
    "in addition , we shall also address the problem of estimating the gw amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and their errors .",
    "previous authors @xcite found it impossible to give isotropic estimates of these quantities , a very strange result for a spherical detector .",
    "we explain why these results come about and we show how the problem can be solved by properly including all the necessary information .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : a_ev ] by deriving analytic expressions for the eigenvalues of @xmath4 .",
    "we then use these expressions to find the first order statistical errors in the eigenvalues in section  [ sec : uncertainties_ev ] , followed by the direction estimation error in section  [ sec : dir_error ] .",
    "higher order corrections to these errors are presented in section  [ sec : corrections ] . in section  [ sec : polarization ] we discuss the errors on the polarization amplitude estimates .",
    "we explain why past solutions have direction dependent errors on these quantities and we describe a maximum likelihood algorithm , based a hypothesis on the physical nature of the source , that fulfills the natural property of source location independence .",
    "the detector response matrix @xmath4 is symmetric and traceless and has the eigenvalue equation    @xmath9    where the eigenvectors are normalized in the usual way    @xmath10    expanding equation we find    @xmath11    where we have defined    @xmath12 %      d \\equiv \\det(\\bi{a}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving this cubic equation we find the eigenvalues of @xmath4 to be    @xmath13    where    @xmath14    the @xmath15 eigenvalue is identically zero in the absence of noise , so it will generally be the one closest to zero in the presence of noise .",
    "random fluctuations may eventually change this ( more likely for low snr ) , but we shall always take the corresponding eigenvector @xmath6 as the best approximation to the direction of the source",
    ". the amplitude of the wave @xmath16 can be calculated in many ways from the mode channels ( for example , @xmath17 is an estimate for the amplitude ) , but the semi - difference of the other two eigenvalues will give the best estimate @xcite , @xmath18",
    "we assume that the mode channels @xmath19 have uncorrelated noise with zero mean and variance @xmath20 .",
    "the lowest order statistical errors in the eigenvalues are easily calculated by @xmath21 where the derivatives of the eigenvalues are given by @xmath22 and the derivatives of the determinant @xmath23 are    @xmath24 if the variances on the mode channels are equal then it is easily seen that equations and lead to    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the variance on any one mode channel .",
    "note that from equation all three eigenvalues have equal variance to first order .",
    "cross correlations between these eigenvalues are also easily calculated , and for equal mode channel variances they are equal for all pairs @xmath27 :    @xmath28    shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ev_error_1]-[fig : ev_error_3 ] is this variance as a function of the @xmath29 . also shown is the results of a monte carlo type simulation of the errors which take into account the higher order perturbations at low values of snr .",
    "as shown , the analytic expressions match the simulated errors for high snr",
    ". for low snr discrepancies arise between the analytic and simulated values .",
    "this is within expectation since equation is only accurate for large snr .",
    "higher order correction will be considered below .",
    "we assume that the eigenvector @xmath6 points in the propagation direction of the gravitational wave .",
    "we want to estimate the fluctuations in the determination of this direction caused by the presence of noisy fluctuations in the mode channels .",
    "we represent with @xmath30 a difference between a given quantity and its ideal value if there were no noise ( i.e. @xmath31 is the difference between the position calculated from noisy data and its real position in the sky ) .",
    "we now take equation for @xmath15 and consider fluctuations in it .",
    "if these are not too large ( high snr ) we can retain only first order terms @xmath32\\delta\\bi{v}_3       =      -\\left[\\delta\\bi{a}-\\delta\\lambda_3\\right]\\bi{v}_3 .",

    "is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the quadratic error in the determination of @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath48    this expression is in perfect agreement with the solid angle estimation error found by zhou and michelson who used a maximum likelihood technique to estimate the wave direction @xcite . this is not surprising as the two methods of estimating the wave direction have been shown to be equivalent ( though the assumptions behind each are quite different )",
    "the advantage of our approach is that , by using unit vectors ( cartesian components ) , we are all the time free from the anomalously high errors and correlations intrinsically associated to the euler angle parametrization .    shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : solid_angle_error ] is the solid angle estimation error as a function of the snr .",
    "also shown is the results of a monte carlo type simulation of the errors . as shown",
    ", the analytic expressions match the simulated errors for high snr .",
    "deviations however appear for lower values of snr .",
    "this again is due to the insufficiency of the first order analytical estimates of the errors . in the next section we present",
    "improved theoretical estimates of the errors by going one order beyond the first in the calculations of variances .",
    "in order to improve our theoretical understanding of the error behaviours of the monte carlo simulations displayed in figs .  [",
    "fig : ev_error_1]-[fig : solid_angle_error ] we need to go one step beyond the linear error terms of equations and .",
    "this requires calculations of higher order derivatives for the added terms , and then the resulting general expressions become quite complicated .",
    "they somewhat simplify for equal mode channel variances , but are still rather cumbersome .",
    "for example , the next order correction to the eigenvalues , assuming the mode channel noises are zero - mean independent gaussian processes , is given by ( see appendix )    @xmath49    after rather long algebra it is found that    @xmath50    it turns out that the series for @xmath51 converges _ very slowly _ for low snr , so that equation only constitutes an improvement on ( [ eq : ev_error ] ) for a rather limited range of snr see figs .",
    "[ fig : ev_error_1]-[fig : ev_error_3 ] .",
    "equation shows that the errors in @xmath52 and @xmath53 split from the error in @xmath54 for low values of snr , and reproduces the observed behaviour that @xmath55 falls below @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "it is a reasonable approximation to @xmath55 for snr between 30 and 6 , but it is not quite as good as regards @xmath56 and @xmath57 for those values of snr .",
    "higher order terms would be required for an improvement , but these imply still much longer calculations of derivatives of the eigenvalues up to the fifth order , as can be seen in equation ( [ eq : sigma_f ] ) of the appendix .",
    "similar corrections can be applied to the incidence direction error estimate of equation .",
    "they appear to be given by    @xmath58    for equal mode channel variances , @xmath26 .",
    "solid angle errors can be directly inferred from here :    @xmath59    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : solid_angle_error ] , the above theoretical prediction is a better approach to the behaviour observed in the numerical simulations than is equation . for snr less than 2 ,",
    "equation is also insufficient .",
    "it is important to remind ourselves that for very low snr the uncertainties on the direction estimation are so large that the measurement is almost meaningless .",
    "zhou and michelson decided that a minimum snr of 10 in energy was necessary for a direction measurement @xcite .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig : solid_angle_error ] this lower limit seems reasonable , thus it is only necessary to have accurate analytical expressions down to that level .",
    "we now come to the discussion of errors in the polarization amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is easily shown that the uncertainty on the measurement of the polarization amplitudes is direction independent if the source position is known ahead of time @xcite , but it has been claimed that in the unknown direction case there is a strong direction dependency @xcite .",
    "this is disturbing given that a spherical detector is equally sensitive to waves of all polarization and direction .",
    "we argue in this section that the difficulties to find isotropic estimates of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are ultimately due to the use of unsuitable criteria to set up those estimates .",
    "we discuss a more natural procedure , based on data set processing , that leads to a solution of this problem .    to understand why a simple estimate of the errors leads to direction dependencies ,",
    "let us look at the basics of the solution to the inverse problem .",
    "we are given 3 eigenvectors and 3 eigenvalues , but these are not independent .",
    "the eigenvectors are orthogonal , so we actually only get 2 pieces of information from them .",
    "we use that information to determine the direction of the wave .",
    "next , the strain tensor is traceless so the third eigenvalue can be determined from the other two , therefore , we only get 2 pieces of information from them .",
    "we use one of them ( actually a combination of 2 ) to get the wave amplitude .",
    "past reasoning suggested that we can use the last piece of information to determine the polarization angle .",
    "this is wrong .",
    "the last eigenvalue does not tell us the polarization , but rather is related to the scalar component of the gw ( or lack thereof ) .",
    "we assume this to be zero for gr , so this can be interpreted as a measurement of the non - zeroness of this component .",
    "the fact that we decide that this should be zero _ a priori _ does not give us additional information about the polarization , only the level of noise in our system . without any additional information we have an under - determined system which will lead to direction dependent errors as seen in reference  @xcite .",
    "the additional piece of information needed is the polarization angle @xmath60 : the angle between the gw s axes and the eigenvectors @xmath34 and @xmath35 perpendicular to the incidence direction @xmath6 . to this end",
    ", we submit our diagonal form of the matrix @xmath4 to a rotation of angle @xmath60 about @xmath6 to obtain best estimates of @xmath7 and @xmath8 by the formulas    @xmath61 where the pure and uncorrelated noise term in @xmath7 was dropped out .",
    "the gw amplitude @xmath62@xmath63@xmath64 has been shown to have a best estimate given by equation .",
    "@xmath62 can be determined with isotropic sensitivity since that is the case with @xmath52 and @xmath53 , as we have just seen . for a _ fixed _",
    "@xmath60 , equations and give us an estimate of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the presence of noise in the detector .",
    "we can use the results of section [ sec : uncertainties_ev ] to see that    @xmath65 and these errors are indeed isotropic , for they only depend on @xmath66 .    in the absence of further information on the specific _ physical _ nature of the source , _",
    "any _ polarization angle @xmath67 is valid , for the canonical form of the tensor  ( [ eqn : wave_strain ] ) is invariant to rotations about the third axis .",
    "a particular choice of @xmath67 is thus a matter of taste in this case , and equations  give the correct error estimates .",
    "a common way @xcite to resolve the arbitrariness in  @xmath67 is to set the first euler angle in the rotation relating the lab frame to the wave frame equal to zero .",
    "however , this is a very much observer dependent criterion , for detectors at different locations would claim different values for @xmath7 and @xmath8 , even if they agreed to be seeing the _ same _ source .",
    "errors in @xmath7 and @xmath8 based on such criterion have been shown e.g.  by @xcite to be strongly direction dependent , which is certainly not surprising .",
    "it is however paradoxical that a spherical detector should prefer certain directions to others to detect a gw signal , therefore this must be reassessed .",
    "we now propose a more consistent solution .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that any criterion to resolve the arbitrariness in @xmath67 , therefore to estimate @xmath7 and @xmath8 , should be established _",
    "relatively to the gw source _ , be it known ahead of time or based on a hypothesis to be checked _",
    "a posteriori_.    let us , for concreteness , consider a _",
    "coalescing binary system _ as the gw source @xcite .",
    "the signal generated by such a system is given by somewhat complicated functions of the space - time variables and a number of system parameters ; it will not be necessary for our purposes to consider in detail the explicit form of such functions ( see for example @xcite ) , it will suffice to use formal expressions indicating the signal dependencies :    @xmath68    here @xmath69 is the source position , and @xmath70 is the time .",
    "@xmath71 stands for the _ set of characteristic source parameters _ , which in this case include the masses of the stars , the inclination of the orbital plane , the semimajor axis , the eccentricity of the orbit , the periastron position , etc .",
    "note that these amplitudes are referred to a set of _ source _ axes , so they are independent of the detector s location .    the usual way to estimate the parameters @xmath71 is to resort to classical statistics @xcite , as has been done for example in @xcite for interferometric detectors or in @xcite for spherical detectors .",
    "the fundamental quantity required by such method is the _ likelihood function _ , @xmath72 , which is a functional of the ( unknown ) signal parameters _ and _ the detector data .",
    "we then proceed as follows : we construct the likelihood function associated to the hypothesis that equations and be a fit to equations and for suitable values of the parameters @xmath73 .",
    "it will thus have the generic form    @xmath74    standard manipulations of @xmath72 yield both best estimates of the signal parameters @xmath71 _ and _ of the polarization angle  @xmath67 , as well as errors and cross correlations between any pair of these it is recalled that such are identified as the coefficients of the _ covariance matrix _ , which is the inverse of the matrix of second derivatives of @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we shall not attempt to give a detailed discussion of this process here .",
    "the important point to stress is that in the approach just proposed , we have managed to have @xmath62 as the only combination of actual data entering the likelihood function @xmath72 .",
    "errors and cross correlations between parameter estimates will thus ultimately be functions only of the errors and cross correlations between the eigenvalue estimates , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which we have proved in section  [ sec : uncertainties_ev ] to be direction independent .",
    "so not only @xmath67 but also the source parameters @xmath71 can be determined with isotropic sensitivity by means of a spherical gw detector .",
    "the same therefore applies to the gw amplitudes @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as indeed expected .",
    "the _ quantitative _ estimation of the errors in @xmath7 and @xmath8 can not however be given explicitly until the full parameter estimation problem has been completely solved , as interactions between all those estimates will strongly affect one another .",
    "with analytic expressions for the uncertainties on the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the mode channel matrix  ( [ eqn : cartesian_strain_tensor ] ) we can turn our attention to the physical interpretation of these values .",
    "an unambiguous selection of @xmath54 can be made on the basis that it is the _ third root _ in equation .",
    "this will usually be the one closest to zero .",
    "then the other two represent the amplitude measurement .",
    "as proved in @xcite , the best estimate of the gw amplitude is the semi - difference of these two , @xmath75 .",
    "the third eigenvalue ideally should be zero if general relativity is correct .",
    "once noise is introduced this is no longer the case , but the variance on this eigenvalue gives us a level of the `` non - zeroness '' .",
    "one can imagine setting a threshold on this eigenvalue that is a function of @xmath76 ( a function of the snr ) to veto any candidate events that have an excessive @xmath54 .",
    "many non - gw sources are likely to produce a non - zero @xmath54 , therefore becoming easily identified and discarded",
    ".    the errors in both eigenvalues and eigenvectors are direction independent .",
    "the last step in the analysis is the splitting of the gw amplitude @xmath62 into the usual @xmath7 and @xmath8 components .",
    "we have shown that this can be accomplished by making suitable reference to the source properties , whereby isotropic sensitivity to these quantities obtains .",
    "this solves the paradox of the anisotropies in the determination of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and stresses the fact that the most fundamental magnitudes to estimate from the detector data are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the mode channel matrix : these are _ source independent _ , and any further progress in signal deconvolution explicitly requires reference to the source properties , be them known ahead of time or be them stated in the form of a hypothesis to test .",
    "let @xmath77 be a set of @xmath78 independent gaussian random variables , with mean @xmath79 and variances @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath81 be a regular function of its arguments . because @xmath82 is a random variable",
    "so is @xmath81 , although it will of course be generally non - gaussian .",
    "we want to find the mean and variance of @xmath81 , and to this end we taylor expand it around the mean @xmath83 : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and the usual convention of summation over repeated indices is adopted in  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) .",
    "the mean of @xmath81 is its expectation value , @xmath86 , while its variance is the difference @xmath87 ^ 2      \\label{eq : ms}\\ ] ]    expectation values are to be taken on the basis of the expansion  ( [ eq : taylor ] ) . given that @xmath82 is a set of independent gaussian variables , the expectation of the product of an _ odd _ number of @xmath88 s is zero , while @xmath89 etc . , where no summation over repeated indices is exceptionally assumed in these expressions .",
    "if the assumption is made that all the @xmath17 s have equal variances , @xmath90 , then one easily finds @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a shorthand for @xmath93 .",
    "likewise ,    @xmath94 ^ 2   =   f^2 + ff_{ii}\\;\\sigma^2 +        \\frac{1}{4}\\,\\left(ff_{iijj}+f_{ij}f_{ij}\\right)\\,\\sigma^4 \\nonumber",
