    "after many years , the fringe topic of _ weak values _",
    "@xcite has entered the spotlight of mainstream physics @xcite .",
    "weak values are said to be a `` new '' kind of physical quantity which `` can be interpreted as a form of conditioned average associated with an observable '' @xcite .",
    "here we give an operational framework for this conditioned average and show that the anomalous values are a ubiquitous feature of generic statistical models not limited to quantum theory . this places serious constraints on the explanatory power of weak values .",
    "why is such an operational framework important ? in 1964 , bell @xcite described a statistical thought experiment which involved two stations which accepted binary inputs and produced binary events conditional on these inputs .",
    "the setup contained _ absolutely no reference to physical theories _ although was devised to teach us a lesson about physics .",
    "this was necessary and crucial since the framework was designed to test theories themselves and thus was required to be model independent .",
    "bell showed two things with this remarkably simple set up : ( 1 ) an inequality on the value of a certain statistic calculated from the data was satisfied by _ every _ local hidden variable model ; and , ( 2 ) entangled quantum systems could violate this inequality .",
    "the consequences of bell work are innumerable . by showing a separation between quantum and classical theory for an _ operational _ task",
    ", bell paved the way for considering quantum mechanical effects not as a nuisance , but as a resource . here",
    "we stand on the shoulders of bell and propose an analogous operational framework for what is known as pre- and post - selected ( pps ) measurement .",
    "that is , we propose a model independent statistical experiment and give an inequality on a certain statistic derived from the data called the _ post - selected shift _ , which can be thought of as an operational generalization of the _ weak value _ from quantum theory .",
    "the inequality is satisfied for any statistical model lacking a certain kind of correlation .",
    "since we brought up bell , one might expect that the only a theory with correlations as rich as quantum mechanics might violate this inequality .",
    "however , we show that classically correlated systems , even without disturbance , can violate the inequality .",
    "we call the violation of the inequality an _ anomalous post - selected shift_. such an effect would , for example , be a necessary consequence of observing anomalous weak values in quantum mechanical systems .",
    "if weak values are truly `` quantum '' , this work proves it is not the anomalous shift of measurement pointers which signals it .",
    "the statistical model is that of three dichotomous events , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we need not make any assumptions about the temporal ordering of these events but it is helpful to consider the sequence @xmath3 . in doing so , we refer to the events as follows : @xmath0 as pre - selection , @xmath1 as the intermediate measurement , and @xmath2 as post - selection .",
    "this situation is depicted in fig .  [ all ] ( a ) .",
    "the most important thing to remember is that there is a single object which encodes all the information we have about the situation : the joint probability @xmath4 this point can not be emphasized enough and could potentially go a long way to resolving other statistically natured paradoxes in quantum theory so we will restate it : _ complete information about any statistical problem is contained in the joint probability distribution of the random variables_. every other probability distribution of interest can be derived from the rules of probability from this object .",
    "a couple examples are : @xmath5    without loss of generality , we take @xmath6 . considering the power series of any function of these variables , it is not difficult to see that any statistical model of these variables can be written @xmath7.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] clearly , there must be constraints on the coefficients . the normalization of the distribution , that is @xmath8 implies @xmath9 for all models . by considering all possibilities of the @xmath10 values of the variables ,",
    "it is easy to see that the positivity condition amounts to 8 inequalities which feature sums and differences of the coefficients , which we will not write out explicitly . because every model can be written in this form , a model is equivalently specified by its coefficient vector : @xmath11    the experimentally accessible quantities we consider here are the pre - selected shift @xmath12 $ ] and the post - selected shift @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "here we have used the notation that @xmath14=\\sum_x \\pr(x|y ) f(x)$ ] is the conditional expectation of @xmath15 given the event @xmath16 .",
    "the term `` shift '' here refers to the case where @xmath1 represents , say , the coarse grained position of a physical meter . under naive classical intuition , the initial condition @xmath0 suffices to determine the full evolution of the state .",
    "thus we might expect @xmath17\\right|\\leq\\left| \\mathbb e_{s|\\psi}[s ] \\right|.\\ ] ] on the other hand , if it happens that @xmath18\\right|>\\left| \\mathbb e_{s|\\psi}[s ] \\right|,\\ ] ] we call this an _ anomalous post - selected shift _ ( apss ) . in this work",
    ", we give a necessary condition for apss and an explicit classical example  in some sense the simplest possible example  not requiring disturbance which achieves apss .",
    "first , however , we review the motivation for considering apss from quantum mechanics , where the effect is referred to as anomalous _ weak values _ @xcite .",
    "consider the states @xmath19 and their orthogonal complements : @xmath20 and @xmath21 . since there is only two possibilities for each , we label the states in eq .",
    "( [ states ] ) as @xmath22 and @xmath23 with the orthogonal states given the opposite sign . in the time between observing which of these states happen ,",
    "we perform a measurement of the pauli @xmath24 operator , labeling the outcomes as @xmath25 for the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "thus , we have three dichotomous random variables and the general model outline above applies .",
    "these states and measurement operators are depicted in fig .",
    "a schematic of an experiment realizing this setup is shown in fig .  [ all ] ( b ) .     the bloch sphere representation of the states involved in the strong and weak measurement protocol of quantum theory . ]",
    "the born rule dictates @xmath26 since the post - measurement state is projected into the eigenstates of @xmath24 , the final measurement probabilities are @xmath27 assuming the initial state is @xmath28 with equal probability , i.e. @xmath29 , the joint distribution is then @xmath30 in terms of the general model eq .  , the strong measurement model is completely specified by coefficient vector @xmath31 the label qs will refer to this model  strong quantum measurement .",
    "now suppose we perform a _ weak _ measurement of the pauli @xmath24 operator , which is described by the quantum operation @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the `` weakness '' parameter .",
    "the conditional state is given by @xmath34 $ ] , and for our example @xmath35   = ( 1 + \\lambda s\\psi \\cos\\theta)/2 $ ] .",
    "using the conditional state above and @xmath36 , the joint distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath2 given @xmath0 is @xmath37 by considering all possibilities , it can be shown that the joint distribution is given by the coefficient vector @xmath38 here qw will refer to this weak quantum measurement model . notice the difference between the strong and weak model ; the terms ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) which contain @xmath1 are multiplied by @xmath41 and @xmath42 changes in a subtle way .",
    "now consider the pre- and post - selected averages in the weak measurement model : @xmath43 & = \\lambda\\cos\\theta\\psi,\\label{qw_pre}\\\\ \\mathbb e^{\\rm qw}_{s|\\psi,\\phi}[s ] & = \\frac{\\lambda\\cos\\theta(\\psi-\\phi)}{1-\\cos 2\\theta \\psi\\phi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if @xmath2 and @xmath0 are different , we have @xmath44= \\frac{\\lambda\\psi}{\\cos\\theta},\\ ] ] and thus , @xmath45\\right|\\geq\\left| \\mathbb e^{\\rm qw}_{s|\\psi}[s ] \\right|.\\ ] ] this model possesses apss .",
    "in the quantum mechanical literature , this is the _ weak value _ phenomenon . indeed , @xmath46=",
    "\\lambda z_w \\psi,\\ ] ] where , when @xmath47 , @xmath48 is called the _ weak value _ @xcite .",
    "but , does eq .",
    "signify something uniquely quantum mechanical has happened ?",
    "does it even have physical significance ? is the weak value a physical quantity ?",
    "the proponents would have us believe the answer is , emphatically , yes .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "one can view eq .   as the expectation value of the course - grained shift of a meter performing the measurement .",
    "notice that the value of the observable @xmath24 is proportional to this shift : @xmath49= \\lambda \\langle \\psi|z|\\psi\\rangle.\\ ] ] but when we perform the pre- and post - selection , we have eq .  .",
    "this appears as if the meter has shifted by an amount proportional to @xmath50 and , moreover , this shift can be larger than the expected shift without post - selection .",
    "this had led some to suggest that @xmath50 is a new kind of physical property of quantum systems @xcite .",
    "be wary , however , that such ideas are guided by falsely applying physical intuition to logical inference which leads to the far worse problem of imposing physical meaning on logical deductions .",
    "we hope by understanding the conditions under which apss occurs , this deep misunderstanding of the purpose and role statistics plays in physical theories can be overcome .    as a first example , we need not look farther that the strong measurement model above . in the strong measurement model , the expectation value of @xmath1 in the distributions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 are @xmath53 & = \\cos\\theta\\psi,\\label{qs_shift}\\\\ \\mathbb e^{\\rm qs}_{s|\\psi,\\phi}[s ] & = \\frac{\\cos\\theta(\\psi-\\phi)}{1-\\cos^2\\theta \\psi\\phi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that for @xmath54 and any @xmath55 , we have @xmath56\\right|\\geq\\left| \\mathbb e^{\\rm qs}_{s|\\psi}[s ] \\right|.\\ ] ] the strong measurement model possesses apss as well .",
    "thus , the distinction between  weak \" and  strong \" measurement is a red herring  apss can occur with or without the notion of measurement strength .",
    "hence , in the remainder , we work with the fully general model .",
    "the defining feature of apss is the reversal of the inequality in moving from eq .   to eq .",
    ", as occurs in the quantum models above  see eq .",
    "and eq .  . here",
    "we show that any model in which @xmath1 and @xmath2 are conditionally independent given @xmath0 can not possess apss .    in a general 3 variable dichotomous model , if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 and @xmath59\\right|\\leq\\left| \\mathbb e_{s|\\psi}[s ] \\right|.\\ ] ]    the proof is as follows .",
    "consider : @xmath60 & = \\sum_s s\\pr(s|\\psi,\\phi),\\\\ & =   \\sum_s s\\frac{\\pr(s,\\phi |\\psi)}{\\pr(\\phi|\\psi)},\\\\ & =   \\sum_s s\\pr(s|\\psi),\\\\ & = \\mathbb e_{s|\\psi } \\left[s\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , @xmath57 implies eq .  .",
    "now , eqs .   and",
    "are true for any model , but the equations become too unwieldy with all 8 coefficients . seeing the proof with @xmath61 ( which halves the number of terms we have to consider in the expansions below )",
    "should make the general proof obvious .",
    "we will proceed by comparing @xmath62 to @xmath63.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] matching coefficients reveals that the only two equations , which are not trivially satisfied , are eqs .   and .",
    "note also that conditional independence is necessary but not sufficient . in a correlated model ,",
    "the post - selected shift is necessarily _ different _ than the pre - selected shift  it just need not be _ larger_.",
    "in ref .  @xcite we devised a classical model specified by @xmath64 where @xmath65 was interpreted in a physical model of coin toss as `` disturbance '' .",
    "the model gives @xmath66 = \\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\delta } > \\lambda =   \\mathbb e_{s|\\psi=+1}[s].\\ ] ] a quick check also reveals eq .",
    "is not satisfied .",
    "either of these facts imply the model is correlated , as required .",
    "however , let us be quick to note that physically interpreting the correlation as disturbance is not necessary .",
    "the simplest way to violate the inequality is to have all terms but one of @xmath40 or @xmath67 not equal to zero ( @xmath68 necessarily equally one ) . for example , take the model with only @xmath69 : @xmath70 or @xmath71 this model implies @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "using these relations , notice that @xmath74\\right|>\\left| \\mathbb e_{s|\\psi}[s ] \\right| = 0,\\ ] ] a maximally anomalous shift ! a physical realization of this model is shown in fig .  [ all ] ( c ) .",
    "a ball is placed in one of six boxes which are arranged in a tetrahedral pattern .",
    "the measuring devices can ask the binary questions shown in the figure ( left - vs - right , front - vs - back and top - vs - bottom ) .",
    "so , for example , when we first find `` right '' , we still do not know whether the ball is in the front or back .",
    "but if the final measurement finds `` bottom '' , necessarily the intermediate measurement gave `` back '' .",
    "indeed , @xmath75 that is , the pre - selected average is zero while the post - selected average is @xmath76 .",
    "this is not surprising  more data ought to change ones knowledge of unknown quantities .",
    "moreover , this ( rather large ) difference does not signify a physical change in the system itself , only our knowledge of it .",
    "the last example shows beyond any doubt that the apss effect is revealing the correlations present in the model .",
    "the example is unequivocally classical by any measure .",
    "observing apss therefore does not imply anything more exotic than classical statistics .",
    "in particular , apss does not bear any relation to physical notions , such as amplitudes @xcite , invasiveness @xcite , disturbance @xcite , contextuality @xcite or interference @xcite .",
    "these properties are all consequences  interesting ones , no doubt  of the structure of quantum theory , some of which are present in various classical theories .",
    "but we have shown here that if that task is to observe an anomalous post - selection shift , the structure of quantum theory is not required .",
    "what is missing for most of the proposed physical meanings for weak values is an understanding of how they arise as a resource for some operational task .",
    "though , another example of an operational inequality ( derived in the context of so - called leggett - garg inequalities ) has been given that holds for any hidden variable model without disturbance @xcite .",
    "a similar result would hold here on a hidden variable view . in this context , the role of the hidden variables is to provide a `` common cause '' for the correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , given @xmath0 .",
    "such a cause would render @xmath1 and @xmath2 conditionally independent given both @xmath0 and the posited hidden variable .",
    "such a demand would require that the consequence of our theorem [ eq .",
    "] always holds . in other words , within a hidden variable model , a change in the hidden variable in moving from the intermediate to post - selected measurement  disturbance  would be necessary to observe apss .",
    "measurement is both a fundamental conceptual and practical tool in all areas of physics , and science more broadly .",
    "one of the core consequences of quantum mechanics was in forcing us to rethink the meaning of measurement .",
    "but some of the cherished niceties of classical physics that we had to give up were never even present in other branches of science .",
    "many branches of science do not even have the kinds of fixed and rigid models we take for granted in physics , and hence the notions of observables or physical quantities are irrelevant . as a consequence",
    ", the word  classical \" , when used in fundamental studies of quantum theory , must be taken with a grain of salt  is it really the most general classical argument to compare to ? or , a more revealing question , can such claims be verified by an experiment provably separating theories ?    here",
    "we have given a simple probabilistic model which reveals anomalous shifts upon post - selection not requiring disturbance .",
    "a theme in quantum foundations and information research is to develop classical models for aspects of quantum theory ( e.g , @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", we hope to whittle down all the features of quantum theory until we are left with the kernel that is `` truly quantum '' . can the correlations which cause anomalous weak values be considered a uniquely quantum feature ?",
    "the above argument casts doubt on this .",
