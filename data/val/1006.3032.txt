    "one of the most puzzling features of quantum theory is its nonlocal nature .",
    "separated observers on a shared entangled state may carry out measurements on such a way that the correlations they generate are outside the set of common cause correlations @xcite .",
    "in particular , such quantum correlations may find application in novel device - independent information tasks , which have no counterparts in the classical world .",
    "they enable perfect security @xcite , randomness generation @xcite and state tomography @xcite without the need to trust the internal working of the devices .",
    "the concept of bell inequalities is a particularly useful tool to detect nonlocal quantum correlations , as violation of a single bell inequality conclusively proves the nonlocal character of correlations .",
    "the standard scenario for a bipartite two - outcome bell test is as follows .",
    "two spacelike separated parties , alice and bob , both share copies of a quantum state @xmath1 of a given dimension @xmath2 .",
    "alice ( bob ) may choose between @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) alternative measurements at random , where each measurement has two possible outcomes @xmath5 .",
    "in a single run of the experiment the correlations between the two @xmath5-valued observables @xmath6 and @xmath7 can be represented by the product @xmath8 . in order to obtain an accurate estimation of the correlations for each pair @xmath9 , alice and bob repeat the experiment many times using a copy of the state @xmath1 in each round . averaging over many runs of the experiment",
    "yields the mean value @xmath10 .",
    "the chsh inequality @xcite is probably the most well - known and simplest example of a bell inequality consisting of two measurement settings ( @xmath11 ) both on alice s and on bob s part .",
    "any correlations in the framework of local classical theories obey the following chsh inequality @xcite , @xmath12 curiously , quantum theory allows for a violation of the chsh inequality , but the strength of nonlocal correlations is still limited , it obeys @xcite @xmath13 where now the expectation values can be expressed by @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 with @xmath5-valued observables @xmath18 , @xmath19 . according to tsirelson s theorem @xcite , the bound applies to any quantum correlations without making assumptions on the sort of measurements or the dimensionality of the states involved . though , the maximum value of @xmath20 can already be achieved with a maximally entangled two - qubit state .",
    "inequalities , whose bound are saturated with quantum correlations without relying on dimensionality such as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tsirelson ] ) were coined as quantum bell inequalities @xcite . there",
    "exist various methods in the literature @xcite , to cite just a few , which enable one to derive quantum bell inequalities .",
    "also , several explicit constructions exist in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , including so - called irrelevant ones @xcite ( where the classical and quantum limits coincide ) .",
    "the method invented by navascus , pironio and acn ( npa ) @xcite is based on the solution of a hierarchy of semidefinite programming ( sdp ) relaxations and is particularly useful since it gives better and better upper bounds on the maximum violation of an arbitrary bell inequality by stepping to higher levels in the hierarchy .",
    "moreover , the series of upper bounds in the hierarchy keep to the exact quantum maximum in terms of commuting measurements @xcite . on the other hand , one can use heuristic algorithms to obtain nontrivial lower bounds in some finite dimensional hilbert spaces on bell inequalities , recovering the explicit form of the states and measurement operators as well .",
    "if the above computed upper and lower bounds coincide within numerical accuracy for a given bell inequality , then we may say that a quantum bell inequality has been obtained , which delimits the boundary of the quantum domain .    in particular , in our previous papers @xcite we computed lower bounds on the maximum quantum violations and determined the corresponding measurement operators and state vectors with two different methods , both involved some parametrization of the operators and applying a downhill simplex method to find the optimum parameters .",
    "the disadvantage of these methods is that the size of the hilbert space was very limited .",
    "we could actually handle systems of maximum eight dimensional real or six dimensional complex component spaces .",
    "different sizes of component spaces require different parametrizations for the operators , hence in order to extend these methods to a higher dimension would involve working out an appropriate parametrization .",
    "moreover , the choice of measurement operators were also limited .",
    "for example , in the case of eight dimensional component spaces only projection operators projecting onto four dimensional subspaces were allowed .    in spite of the limitations we could get the maximum quantum violation of the great majority of inequalities we considered ( the list comprises 241 bipartite bell inequalities with up to five settings per party collected from refs .",
    "@xcite and detailed results concerning their optimum violations are presented in the web page @xcite ) .",
    "however , there were still a few exceptions , where the upper bound value resulting from the npa method @xcite did not match the best lower bound result .",
    "the most interesting one was the case of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the smallest case we considered , and perhaps the simplest tight bell inequality after the chsh one , with only three measurement settings per party .",
    "it was introduced by froissart @xcite back in 1981 , and recently reinvented in refs .",
    "it reads @xmath21 in a local classical model we have the maximum value of 0 , while the largest violation one could get with qubits was 0.25 , which could already be achieved with a maximally entangled pair of qubits ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the best upper bounds are based on the npa method @xcite and at level three it yields the significantly higher upper bound , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "we could even go above level three to an intermediate level in @xcite , and presently we have got the upper bound @xmath23 at level four . from the dependence of the bound on the level it was derived it seemed to be clear that it would not go much lower ( note also that the computational complexity of the sdp problem increases dramatically with higher levels of relaxations ) .",
    "in fact , it is the above observation , which motivated us to search for a quantum violation beyond the two - qubit value of @xmath24 .    in the present paper we set out to resolve the puzzling problem concerning the maximum quantum violation of the @xmath0 inequality .",
    "to this end , we introduce in sec .",
    "[ ital ] an efficient iterative algorithm which was applied to explore the largest quantum violation of @xmath0 for states up to local dimension 20 . sec .",
    "[ const ] contains the main results , presenting the explicit construction of states and measurement operators , which give by means of an iterative method the conjectured maximal quantum value of @xmath0 in function of the dimensionality .",
    "in particular , for dimensions very large we recover the upper bound computed with the npa method at level four within high numerical accuracy , thereby establishing a quantum bell inequality for @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the optimal quantum state in the infinite dimensional space is far from the maximally entangled state , thereby supporting the claim that entanglement and nonlocality are different resources @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ other ] we investigate the remaining 19 bell inequalities from a set of 241 inequalities ( plus two additional symmetric 4-setting inequalities from ref .",

    "[ conc ] summarizes the results achieved .",
    "as mentioned above , the drawback of our previous heuristic methods in refs .",
    "@xcite for computing lower bounds on the maximum quantum violation of bell inequalities is that the size of the local hilbert space we could handle is limited up to dimension eight . with the iterative method",
    "we introduce here for two - outcome bell inequalities we can go to higher dimensions , which is only limited by the computational difficulties due to the increasing complexity of the problem with increasing hilbert space dimensions . similarly to the previous methods , this algorithm does not guarantee to converge to the global optimum solution . in case of larger spaces",
    "we may miss it even after tens of thousands of restarts with different initial values .",
    "nevertheless , it managed to find every optima we derived with our previous methods , and in almost all cases it has done it considerably faster .",
    "the problem to be solved consists of maximizing the quantum value of the bell expression with coefficients @xmath25 , which can be written as : @xmath26 where there are @xmath3 and @xmath4 measurement settings for alice and bob , respectively , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are the measurement operators of alice and bob , respectively , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are unit operators in the component spaces , and @xmath1 is the state vector",
    ". the maximum can always be reached by a pure state . in case of two - outcome measurements",
    "it is enough to consider projection operators as the measurement operators @xcite .",
    "when there are only two parties , a further simplification is that when we take a matrix representation of the expression above , we may choose the bases in the component spaces such that they correspond to the schmidt decomposition of the state vector @xmath1 . if we confine ourselves to @xmath33-dimensional component spaces we get : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are components of matrices of @xmath27 and @xmath29 , respectively , and @xmath37 are the schmidt coefficients of the state vector . if @xmath33 is smaller than the dimensionality of the component spaces required for the maximum quantum violation , then @xmath38 .    to solve the problem first",
    "we choose appropriate random matrices and numbers for bob s measurement operators , and for @xmath37 . to get the matrices ,",
    "first we take a diagonal matrix with zero and one diagonal values chosen randomly , then we apply many random two dimensional unitary ( or if we confine ourselves to real matrices , orthogonal ) transformations . for @xmath37",
    "we take positive numbers between zero and one from a uniform distribution , then we normalize them . in the iterative algorithm the first step is to calculate the optimal measurement operators of alice , given bob s operators and the state vector .",
    "this can be done directly .",
    "equation ( [ eq : bellexmat ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 we can get the matrix of the optimum @xmath41 ( @xmath28 ) the following way . first we diagonalize the matrix of @xmath42 . then we create a diagonal matrix .",
    "we choose its diagonal matrix element one where the diagonalized matrix of @xmath42 contains a positive number , and zero otherwise .",
    "then we transform this matrix with the inverse of the transformation that diagonalized the matrix of @xmath42 . to show that this is the matrix of the optimal @xmath41 we note that trace is invariant to basis transformation , and it is easy to see that the optimum matrix of projector @xmath41 in the basis diagonalizing @xmath42 is the one we have chosen .",
    "the second step is to derive bob s optimal matrices while alice s matrices and the state vector are fixed .",
    "this can be done equivalently to the first step .",
    "these two steps are the same as the steps of the see - saw algorithm by werner and wolf @xcite , who used it to get maximum violation with fixed ( not necessarily pure ) states .",
    "a variant of the see - saw algorithm for bell inequalities with multiple outcomes was also devised  @xcite .    in the third step",
    "the best state vector is calculated for the measurement operators .",
    "it is done the same way as in our previous method @xcite .",
    "an algorithm applying this very third step has been also used by liang et al .",
    "@xcite to compute quantum optima for multiple - outcome bell expressions . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bellexmat ] ) it is clear that the optimal @xmath37 corresponds to the eigenvector belonging to the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath43 and the eigenvalue is just the value of the bell expression .",
    "it is not sure that the components of the largest eigenvector will all be positive real numbers .",
    "if they are not , they can not be called schmidt coefficients .",
    "however , this does not affect anything , it is best just to leave them as they are .",
    "if we want to see the final result for the state vector represented by its schmidt coefficients , it is enough to make the appropriate transformation at the end of the calculation .",
    "we simply have to multiply rows and columns of either alice s or bob s matrices with phase factors .",
    "the algorithm consists of repeating these three steps until the value of the bell expression reach convergency . as this number may only increase in each step",
    ", convergence is ensured .",
    "what is not ensured is that we will converge to the global optimum of the problem .",
    "therefore , we have to repeat the full procedure many times with different initial values .",
    "we may save computation time if we stop a run when it clearly goes towards an inferior solution .",
    "for example , if we are interested in a solution belonging to a larger hilbert space , we may stop whenever too many components of the state vector falls below some threshold .",
    "it is not difficult to extend the method to more than two participants . in that case",
    "there is no schmidt decomposition , which would ensure that one can choose the bases in the component spaces such that the @xmath44-dimensional state vector has only @xmath33 nonzero components .",
    "however , one can still use eq .",
    "( [ eq : aopti ] ) to calculate the optimum measurement operators for alice , and analogous equations for the operators of the other participants .",
    "the only difference is that the formula for the matrix of @xmath42 ( and the corresponding matrices for the other participants ) will be somewhat more complicated than eq .",
    "( [ eq : xmat ] ) , involving summations to more indices .",
    "the optimum state vector can also be calculated as the eigenvector belonging to the largest eigenvalue of a matrix , but this will be a more general matrix in the full @xmath44-dimensional hilbert space . as the third step of the algorithm in this case involves the diagonalization of a much larger matrix than the first two steps , it is more efficient to do it less frequently , that is to repeat the first and the second steps several times before updating the state vector .",
    "from the optimality of formula  ( [ eq : bellexmat ] ) it follows that the matrices of the optimum @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are such that they satisfy the following eq .",

    "we found most of the matrix elements zero within expected numerical accuracy , and for odd number of dimensions it turned out that with some appropriate reordering of the bases we could also make all matrices blockdiagonal with one block having a single element , while the rest consisting of two by two blocks , with all matrix elements real . in the cases of @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath50 , the block of size one is the first one , while in the cases of @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath47 it is the last one .",

    "although @xmath0 is one of the simplest bell inequalities with just three measurements per party , surprisingly we found that the maximum value of 0.25 achievable with a pair of qubits could be only be overcome by using states of dimension at least @xmath141 .",
    "moreover , we found a family of measurement operators and states , which attains numerically in very large dimensional hilbert spaces ( and hence in the limit of infinite dimensions as well ) the largest possible value of the bell expression @xmath0 allowed by quantum theory . taking as a conjecture that our construction is optimal ( in the sense that no finite dimension suffices to achieve the true quantum maximum for @xmath0 ) , to our knowledge this constitutes the first example of a bell scenario concerning finite number of measurements and outcomes , where measuring finite dimensional quantum systems is not enough to obtain exactly all quantum correlations . in this respect",
    "we wish to invoke the concept of dimension witnesses introduced recently in ref .  @xcite . in a broader sense ,",
    "the aim of this concept is to put a lower bound on the hilbert space dimension needed to reproduce the statistics arising from a bell experiment .",
    "dimension witnesses have been found or conjectured in many different scenarios , such as for the bipartite setting @xcite for the multipartite setting @xcite and even for the case of a single system @xcite .    in particular , for measurements with binary outcomes",
    "it was shown how to get dimension witnesses analytically for any dimensions @xcite .",
    "actually , these results entail that no finite dimension is sufficient to generate the whole set of quantum correlations provided an arbitrary number of two - outcome measurements is involved .",
    "consider now a scenario where the number of measurements ( each having a finite number of outcomes ) is finite .",
    "does there exist a bell inequality requiring infinitely large entangled states for obtaining the maximum possible quantum violation ?",
    "that is , are there quantum correlations corresponding to this scheme attainable exactly by measuring infinite dimensional quantum systems ? this is a question posed recently by navascus et al .",
    "@xcite .    indeed , in the present paper we suggested , supported by thorough numerical computations , that no finite dimension suffices to maximally violate the @xmath0 inequality .",
    "while we can not guarantee that for any finite dimension there exist no other construction beyond ours giving a larger quantum value , nevertheless we showed that our best conjectured values tend to the upper limit computed with the aid of the npa method @xcite .",
    "we pose it as a challenge to provide an analytical proof of our conjecture .",
    "also , in our view it would be interesting to find other , bipartite or multipartite , bell inequalities beyond @xmath0 ( but still involving finite number of settings and outcomes ) requiring infinitely large entangled states for their maximal quantum violation .",

    "we thank for the help of brian borchers , who used some of our problems as test cases for his code for semidefinite programming , and this way provided us with improved upper bounds for those cases .",

    "<S> the maximal quantum violation can already be attained with local two - dimensional quantum systems , however , there is no such evidence for the @xmath0 inequality . in this paper a family of measurement operators and states is given which enables us to attain the largest possible quantum value in an infinite dimensional hilbert space . </S>",
    "<S> further , it is conjectured that our construction is optimal in the sense that measuring finite dimensional quantum systems is not enough to achieve the true quantum maximum . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe an efficient iterative algorithm for computing quantum maximum of an arbitrary two - outcome bell inequality in any given hilbert space dimension . </S>",
    "<S> this algorithm played a key role to obtain our results for the @xmath0 inequality , and we also applied it to improve on our previous results concerning the maximum quantum violation of several bipartite two - outcome bell inequalities with up to five settings per party . </S>"
