    "strong lensing systems provide the dual opportunity to study both the foreground mass distribution along the line of sight to the lens and the physical properties of the background object that is being lensed .",
    "the latter is especially useful in studies of high - redshift galaxies , for which lensing provides a vital boost in the apparent brightness of these faint objects , which are otherwise difficult to study in detail .    for many years",
    "the @xmath11 system cb58 @xcite served as the prototypical lensed high - redshift lyman break galaxy ( lbg ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "it is very bright and thereby allowed a number of detailed studies of the physical properties of a _ single _ lbg to be carried out ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recently a number of high - redshift lensed systems have been discovered , either serendipitously or in systematic searches , that are brighter than cb58 @xcite , including the current record holder , the `` 8  oclock arc , '' at @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these discoveries have been enabled by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which provides the very large search area needed to systematically find these rare examples of extremely bright lensed high - redshift galaxies .",
    "in this paper we report on the discovery of another remarkably bright ( @xmath9 ) strongly lensed @xmath0 galaxy , the first system we have confirmed from a systematic search program for very bright lensed arcs that we are carrying out using the sdss data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  [ sec : search ] describes the arc search and the discovery ,  [ sec : follow_up ] describes the follow - up imaging and spectroscopy that led to confirmation of the system as a gravitational lens ,  [ sec : modeling ] describes the modeling of the system including the photometry measurements ,   [ sec : sfr ] describes the source galaxy star formation rate measurements , and finally  [ sec : conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 , unless otherwise noted .",

    "* ) down to @xmath19 and obtained spectra for @xmath20 astronomical objects @xcite .",

    "we previously reported the serendipitous discovery in the sdss data release 4 ( dr4 ; * ? ? ? * ) of the brightest lensed lyman break galaxy ( lbg ) currently known , the 8 oclock arc @xcite .",
    "the lbg in that system is at a redshift of 2.73 and is lensed by a luminous red galaxy ( lrg ) at a redshift of 0.38 .",
    "the three bright gravitationally lensed images have a total magnitude of @xmath13 and are quite blue ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "motivated by this discovery and using the characteristics of the 8  oclock arc system as our starting point , we have conducted a systematic search @xcite for similar systems in the sdss data release 5 ( dr5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the search started from two catalogs : the first consisting of 221,000 lrgs derived from the sdss database and the second consisting of 29,000 brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) compiled by one of us ( j.  annis ) using an earlier version @xcite of the maxbcg cluster finding technique @xcite .",
    "we defined a database query which was run on the dr5 catalog archive server ( cas ) database .",
    "this query searched for lrgs and bcgs which have one or more neighboring blue objects , defined using color cuts @xmath22 and @xmath23 , that were detected by the sdss photometric pipeline within a search radius of @xmath24 .",
    "we note that due to issues of seeing and object deblending in the sdss , our search will effectively find systems with einstein radii larger than about @xmath25 or so .",
    "our search is therefore complementary to a spectroscopic lensing survey like the sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is limited to systems with image separations smaller than the @xmath26 sdss spectroscopic fiber diameter .",
    "our query returned 57,485 systems , which were then ranked by the number of blue objects , @xmath27 .",
    "the 1081 systems with @xmath28 were inspected by four separate inspectors who looked for arc - like morphology in the sdss cas @xmath29 color jpeg images .",
    "the 14 final candidates found in this sample have already been described in @xcite , including an initial analysis of their einstein radii and mass - to - light ratios . to date",
    "we have spectroscopically confirmed 6 of them as lensed , including 3 with source redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "additional details of follow - up observations and lens modeling for these systems , as well as for other systems found in a separate search of a sample of sdss interacting / merging galaxies , will be the subject of future papers .",
    "one inspector also examined the 7442 systems in the @xmath30 sample , which yielded the object described in this paper .",
    "this system was the brightest and most striking arc candidate from the @xmath30 list , and we dubbed the system the `` clone '' as it was very similar to the 8  oclock arc in morphology and brightness . in fig .",

    "in order to confirm the clone system as a gravitational lens we have carried out a follow - up program of imaging and spectroscopy using the astrophysical research consortium ( arc ) 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) and the 8.2 m subaru telescope on mauna kea .",

    "we also astrometrically aligned the world coordinate system ( wcs ) of each image to that of the first image , using the iraf ccmap task .",
    "the images were then remapped and coadded , specifically median - combined , with account made for the relative flux scalings between the images , using the swarp v2.16 package the final photometric zeropoint was derived by matching objects detected by sextractor in the coadded @xmath34-band image with those in the calibrated @xmath36- and @xmath37-band images from the apo 3.5 m telescope ; the apo images were themselves calibrated using sdss matches , as described below in  [ apo_photometry ] .",
    "note this bootstrapping method gives a more robust photometric zeropoint as it provides more objects compared to directly matching the subaru and sdss data , due to the small size of the subaru image and the shallow depth of the sdss data .",

    "the data were obtained under photometric conditions , and the seeing ranged from 0.9@xmath381.2@xmath38 . the total exposure time in each filter was 900  sec , divided into three dithered exposures ( with @xmath45 offsets ) of 300  sec each in order to reject cosmic rays and bad pixels .",

    "we proceed next to derive a lensing model for the clone system and to measure the photometric properties of the lensing galaxies and the lensed images .",
    "the first step is to model the lens components of the image so that their light can be subtracted off , leaving us with just the light of the lensed images that we can use to derive the lensing model , as described below in  [ lens_modeling ] . to model the lensing galaxies we have used the galfit program @xcite .",
    "galfit can perform a simultaneous fit to multiple objects in a fits image .",
    "it allows the user to fit a number of common galaxy profiles such as sersic , de vaucouleurs , and exponential disk .",

    "the modeling was done using the coadded @xmath34-band subaru image as it has the highest resolution .",
    "the psf was determined from stars in the image .",
    "we also included the arc and counter - image in the galfit model , but did not include the two faint galaxies that can be seen in the bottom right of fig  [ subaru_image ] .",
    "the best description of the system is obtained using a sersic profile for the main lrg , de vaucouleurs profiles for the two small galaxies ( c and d ) , and a combination of 5 exponential disks for the arc and one exponential disk for the counter - image .",

    "[ galfit_table ] we show the fitted parameters and in fig .  [ galfit ] we show the model and the data  model residual image . from the residual image",
    "we can see that the galaxies b , c , and d are well modeled , but that the exponential disk model for the arcs is not perfect .",
    "we then subtract off the models for just the lens objects b , c , and d from the image , leaving us with the light of the lensed arc and counter - image for the subsequent lens modeling .",
    "we have modeled the lens using the lensview program @xcite , a program for modeling resolved gravitational lenses .",
    "it is based on the lensmem algorithm @xcite and uses a maximum entropy constraint to find the best fitting lens mass model and source brightness distribution .",
    "it supports a number of common mass models .",
    "the inputs to the program are a fits image of the lensing system with the non - arc objects removed ( fig .",
    "[ lens_input_image_mask ] , left plot ) , a fits file containing the psf for the image , a fits image of the pixel - by - pixel variance of the data , an empty fits image with the dimensions of the desired source plane , and a fits image containing a mask of the pixels over which the @xmath50 will be calculated ( fig .",
    "[ lens_input_image_mask ] , right plot ) .",

    "we have modeled the system using a singular isothermal ellipsoid ( sie ; * ? ? ?",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ lens_model_images ] , left plot , and the predicted source with the corresponding tangential caustic is given in fig .",
    "[ lens_model_images ] , right plot .",
    "the best - fit lens center is offset by a small amount , ( @xmath57 in ( ra , dec ) , which is much less than 1 pixel ( recall the scale is @xmath32 per pixel ) from the center of the lrg light distribution obtained from galfit .",
    "the total magnification of the system , obtained by dividing the total flux in the arcs by the total flux in the source , is @xmath5 . comparing fig .",
    "[ lens_input_image_mask ] ( left ) and fig .  [ lens_model_images ] ( left ) , we see that the model does look qualitatively quite like the data .",
    "the best fit @xmath49 is 2.18 ( 2102 for 968 dof ) , however , indicating formally a poor fit .",
    "this can be understood by looking at the pixel - by - pixel residuals scaled by the errors , @xmath58 , shown in fig .",
    "[ lens_model_residual ] .",
    "we see that there are large residuals coming from the a3 knot , which is brighter in the data than in the model by 23% within a @xmath26 aperture .",
    "we have explored other mass models including sie+external shear but find similar or worse agreement .    in strong lensing",
    "it has been known for some years that the smooth mass models fit the image positions well but not always the flux ratios of the images . as lensview uses the full image information it is not possible to use it to determine how well the image positions alone are determined .",
    "so we turn to gravlens / lensmodel @xcite which allows us to fit an sie model using only the image positions .",
    "we use the a1-a4 image positions determined by running sextractor on the subaru image and given in table  [ table_photometry ] ( same as used below in  [ apo_photometry ] ) .",
    "we assign large errors to the flux ratios so that they do not contribute to the @xmath50 .",
    "we obtain a very good fit to the image positions , with a @xmath50 of 2.55 for 3 dof and values of the sie parameters that agree with those from the lensview fit . as the image positions",
    "are well determined , the statistical errors quoted above for our lens model parameters are from the lensmodel fit rather than the lensview fit . the predicted flux for a3 in the lensmodel fit is smaller than the measured flux by a factor of 2 .",
    "this is more discrepant than what we obtained from lensview above , in which the source light distribution is more realistically modeled as an extended source , as opposed to a point source as used in lensmodel .",
    "the a3 flux is also not better matched by adding external shear or by adding galaxies c and d as singular isothermal spheres .",
    "an interesting discussion of anomalous flux ratios in 4-image lenses with a fold configuration , as is the case for our system , can be found in @xcite .",
    "they define the ratio @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the observed fluxes for a pair of images of opposite parity , as indicated by the subscripts .",
    "they model @xmath62 for different image pairs in 4-image lenses .",
    "deviations from the expected values are thought to indicate the presence of structure at scales smaller than the separation between the images .",
    "we measure @xmath63 for the image pair a3-a2 .",
    "this value is not consistent with the range of values shown in fig .  5 of @xcite .",
    "given this result and our poor @xmath50 from lensview we conclude that we may have substructure in the lens which is currently not being well modeled using a smooth sie mass distribution .    from the sie model , the velocity dispersion of the mass distribution doing the lensing is @xmath64 , which would be quite large for an elliptical galaxy .",
    "the sdss database does not provide a spectroscopic velocity dispersion for the lrg due to the low signal - to - noise of the sdss spectrum .",
    "we obtained a similarly large value for the velocity dispersion of the 8  oclock arc lensing mass , which is discussed in @xcite .",
    "combined with the large @xmath65 einstein radius and the presence of neighboring red galaxies like c , d , e ( see  [ apo_photometry ] ) , and others further away , this indicates that the lensing is due in part to the group environment around the central lrg ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we have thus investigated two alternative mass models to attempt a better approximation of the group lensing contribution , specifically using sie+external shear and a navarro , frenk , & white ( nfw ) profile @xcite .",
    "however , the lensview fits in both cases give about 10% worse @xmath66 per dof than the simple sie model , and in particular the sie+external shear model gives only a small shear of 0.006 that is closely aligned with the position angle of the main sie profile .",
    "we will further investigate the group lensing environment , as well as the substructure issues noted above , using higher - resolution hst imaging data that we are analyzing for this system @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , using the current data and a simple sie fit , we are able to provide a reasonable model that reproduces the most salient features of the lensing system , namely the positions and morphology of the lensed arc and counter - image .",
    "since both the redshift of the lrg and the source are known we are able to determine the angular diameter distance to the source ( @xmath67 ) , to the lens ( @xmath68 ) , and between the source and lens ( @xmath69 ) , to be 1209 , 801 and 829 @xmath70 mpc , respectively . then from the simple sie model we can determine the mass interior to @xmath71 using @xmath72 . as we are using the sie convention of @xcite , to be more precise the enclosed mass is actually defined within an elliptical aperture with semi - major axis @xmath73 , and axis ratio and position angle as given above . for the same aperture",
    ", we also determine the lens light , by summing the fluxes from the best - fitting galfit models for the lrg and for galaxies c and d ( see   [ subaru_photometry ] and [ apo_photometry ] ) ; the results are given in table  [ table_photometry ] .",
    "note that due to the similarity of the einstein radius of the lens mass model to the half - light ( or effective ) radius of the lrg , and likewise for the respective axis ratios and position angles ( cf .",
    "table  [ galfit_table ] ) , the flux within the lens light aperture is very close to half the total flux of the lrg ( galaxies c and d contribute only a small amount ) .",
    "we then convert the apparent lens light to absolute fluxes , adopting @xmath74-corrections using an elliptical galaxy template @xcite , and obtain mass - to - light ratios in the rest - frame @xmath6 bands of @xmath75 , and 12  @xmath76 , respectively ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "we note that these @xmath78 values , out to a radius of @xmath79  kpc , are @xmath475 - 10 times larger than those for the lensing lrgs , on the scale of a few kpc , from the slacs sample @xcite . as shown fig .",
    "7.8 of @xcite , this trend of @xmath78 with radius is consistent with that determined for elliptical galaxies using independent dynamical and x - ray techniques @xcite .",
    "we turn now to the photometry analysis of the apo 3.5 m spicam coadded imaging data in order to derive color information for the various lensing galaxies and lensed image components .",
    "because the spicam data were taken under only modest seeing conditions , we will rely on the galaxy profile parameters determined earlier from running galfit on the subaru @xmath34-band image , rather than try to re - fit those parameters independently in each of the spicam @xmath43 images . specifically",
    ", we adopt all the best - fit @xmath34-band profile parameters for the lrg (= galaxy b ) , galaxies c and d , and counter - image a4 , _ except _ that we will fit for the total magnitude of each of those four components .",
    "moreover , we also re - fit for the position of the lrg , in order to account for small errors in the astrometric registration relative to the subaru image ; we find best - fit shifts of @xmath80 , which are small but nonetheless result in noticeable visual improvement in the residual image after subtracting off the lrg model .",
    "note we do not attempt to fit models to the lensed arc images , as was done for the subaru data .",
    "instead , we mask out the image areas corresponding to the a1 , a2 , and a3 components before running galfit on the spicam data .",
    "the masks are derived using sextractor - generated `` segmentation '' images , which flag the pixels belonging to each detected object .",
    "we will later compute aperture magnitudes for the arc components , in a model - independent way as described below .",
    "for the psf model needed by galfit , we use the best - fit moffat profile derived by galfit for a bright unsaturated star in a given image . we find that our results are not sensitive to whether we use the moffat profile or the actual data for the star itself as the psf model .",
    "note we also first use sextractor to do sky subtraction on an image before feeding it to galfit .",
    "our galfit photometry results for the spicam coadded @xmath43 images are given in table  [ table_photometry ] .",
    "we plot the @xmath6 total magnitudes of the lrg and of galaxies c and d in fig .",
    "[ lensing_galaxy_magnitudes ] , where we have also overlaid a template elliptical galaxy spectrum from @xcite , after redshifting to the lrg redshift @xmath81 and converting the flux of the spectrum to ab magnitude units .",
    "the reasonable match of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ; described by the @xmath6 magnitudes ) of galaxies c and d to the template spectrum is consistent with the interpretation of those two galaxies as early - type galaxies at the same redshift as the lrg .",
    "as noted above , for the lensed arc image components a1-a3 , we measure simple aperture magnitudes .",
    "we do this instead of attempting profile fitting since we do not expect the lensed and distorted arc images to follow standard galaxy profiles , as can be seen in the residual image shown in figure  [ galfit ] ( right panel ) for the subaru data .",
    "we measure 3@xmath38-diameter circular aperture magnitudes for each of the a1-a3 arc components , with centers determined from running sextractor on the subaru image .",
    "the aperture magnitudes are measured from the images after subtraction of the best - fit galfit galaxy models as described above . the subaru @xmath34-band image is first convolved by a gaussian to degrade the seeing to 1.0@xmath38 to match the typical seeing in the spicam data .",
    "otherwise no aperture corrections are made to reconcile the small seeing differences among the @xmath43 data .",
    "we also ignore a small overlap in the apertures centered on the a1 and a2 components and do not attempt any deblending .",
    "in addition , we define a partial annular aperture , centered on the lrg , with inner radius 3@xmath38 , outer radius 5.5@xmath38 , and position angle ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath83 degrees e of n. this ( partial ) annulus provides a simple aperture that captures the shape and flux of the lensed arc .",
    "our aperture photometry results for lensed arc images are presented in table  [ table_photometry ] .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ lensed_image_magnitudes ] that the lensed a3 component and the counter - image a4 show excellent agreement in their seds , as described by their @xmath6 magnitudes .",
    "this also gives us confidence that our galfit galaxy fitting and model subtraction procedure is working well , as a4 is significantly fainter than a3 and one might have expected that a4 s photometry is prone to proportionately more error due to contamination by the light of the lrg . however , fig .",
    "[ lensed_image_magnitudes ] also shows that the a2 and especially the a1 components are significantly redder than the a3 component .",
    "this may also be seen from fig .",
    "[ spicam_image ] , where the upper part of the a1 knot appears noticeably redder than the rest of the arc .",
    "it turns out from our higher - resolution hst data @xcite that there is also a small red galaxy , henceforth galaxy e , inside a1 s 3@xmath38 aperture .",
    "there is also some flux from galaxy e contaminating the a2 aperture due to seeing .",
    "although galaxy e is not resolved from the arc even in our best - seeing ground - based data , the subaru image , we can nonetheless infer its brightness by assuming it has the same sed as the lrg .",
    "we therefore decompose the flux within the a1 , a2 , and annular apertures as a linear combination of two flux components : one with the sed of a3 to account for the lensed source galaxy flux , and the other with the sed of the lrg to account for the galaxy e flux .",
    "doing this allows us to `` decontaminate '' the galaxy e flux from the a1 , a2 , and annular apertures . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lensed_image_magnitudes ] , this procedure produces good fits to the total fluxes within the a1 , a2 , and annular apertures , and in that figure and in table  [ table_photometry ] we also show the `` decontaminated '' fluxes obtained by subtracting the best - fit lrg - component flux from the original fluxes within each of those apertures .",
    "note that this is not a trivial result as the procedure uses only two parameters ( the two flux components ) to fit the five data points ( the @xmath6 fluxes ) for each aperture .",
    "also , from the annulus result we find that the galaxy e flux is about 2% of the lrg flux , making galaxy e comparable to galaxies c and d in brightness ( see table  [ table_photometry ] ) . in the @xmath34-band ,",
    "the galaxy e flux contaminating the annular aperture is about @xmath84 of the lensed source galaxy flux , implying only a small perturbation for the lensview modeling results presented above using the subaru image .",
    "to estimate the star formation rate ( sfr ) and the amount of dust extinction , we compare our @xmath6 sed data to models from the galaxev @xcite stellar population evolution package .",
    "we use simple constant star formation rate models , with solar metallicity and a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) over the mass range @xmath85 , and we also add dust extinction according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "we consider ages of 10 myr , 100 myr , and 1 gyr for the models , and set values of the ( stellar continuum ) color excess @xmath86 to 0.3 , 0.25 , and 0.2 , respectively , in order to get a good visual match to the slope of the @xmath6 data for the annulus aperture ; see fig .",
    "[ sed_models ] .",
    "we set the normalization of each model by finding the average offset between the observed and model @xmath6 magnitudes . to facilitate comparison with previous simple sfr estimates for cb58 and the 8 oclock arc , we express our results in analogy with eqn .",
    "( 6 ) of @xcite , but using a flat cosmology with @xmath77 , and @xmath87 , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the lensing magnification corresponding to the flux inside the annulus aperture , @xmath90 is the extinction at rest wavelength 1500   , @xmath91 is the flux at rest 1500  for a model forming stars at 1 @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is a correction factor to the salpeter imf , as described by @xcite and references therein .",
    "the numerical values given in eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_sfr ] ) are for our fiducial model with an age of 100 myr and @xmath8 .",
    "the corresponding numbers for the 10 myr , @xmath94 and 1 gyr , @xmath95 models are , respectively : @xmath96 ; @xmath97 ; and @xmath98 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ sed_models ] , although an example dust - free 100 myr model is clearly ruled out , all three of the dusty models considered give good matches to the data and can not be distinguished given our data , which cover just rest - frame uv wavelengths . we defer a fuller model - fitting analysis to a future paper that will also include the imaging and spectroscopic data we have obtained at observed - frame ir = rest - frame optical wavelengths , which will allow us to set much more stringent constraints on model ages , dust extinction and star formation rates ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "nevertheless , we can still compare star formation rates obtained under similar assumptions for other systems .",
    "in particular , for the fiducial 100 myr model , the resulting sfr of @xmath7 is about twice the value of @xmath99 obtained by @xcite for cb58 ( after converting to our adopted cosmology ) , but it is much lower than the @xmath100 obtained by @xcite for the 8 oclock arc .",
    "we can also compare our source galaxy with the sample of about 100 ( unlensed ) @xmath42 star - forming galaxies of @xcite , who derived sfrs using detailed sed fitting with @xcite models , including additional ir data in the fits .",
    "the bulk of the @xcite sample galaxies were best fit with constant sfr models like the ones we have used .",
    "overall those galaxies have a mean best - fit age of 1046 myr , @xmath86 of 0.15 and sfr of @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) , which becomes @xmath103 after converting to our conventions . , for a factor of 1.8 to convert the sfr normalization from the @xcite imf used by @xcite back to a salpeter imf , and finally for our use of the factor @xmath104 from @xcite .",
    "] we see that our source galaxy appears somewhat dustier , but otherwise it has a star formation rate close to the typical @xmath42 star - forming galaxy from the @xcite sample .",
    "we have reported on the discovery of the clone system , consisting of a star - forming , bx / bm - type lyman break galaxy in the sdss at a redshift of @xmath105 , which is strongly lensed by a foreground luminous red galaxy at a redshift of @xmath1 .",
    "the lensed galaxy is remarkably bright , and at @xmath9 it is among the brightest known lensed source galaxies with @xmath10 .    a simple sie lens model for the system yields an einstein radius of @xmath106 ( or @xmath107  @xmath70  kpc at the lens redshift ) , a total lensing mass within the einstein radius of @xmath108 , and a magnification factor for the lensed lbg of @xmath5 . combining the lens model with our follow - up @xmath6 photometry",
    ", we have also estimated the ( unlensed ) star formation rate ( sfr ) of the source galaxy to be @xmath7 , adopting a fiducial constant - sfr galaxy evolution model with an age of 100 myr and @xmath8 .",
    "such a star formation rate is similar to that found for samples of similar , but unlensed , @xmath42 bx / bm galaxies .",
    "we are pursuing a number of further follow - up observations on this system , and we currently have optical and infrared data from hst cycle 16 , spitzer cycle 4 , and gemini north programs .",
    "the hst images indicate that the system is more complex than can be seen from the ground , and analysis of that higher resolution data will help us investigate the issues of substructure and image flux anomalies that we have encountered in the lens modeling described here . moreover",
    ", we will also use the sed information provided by the additional near - ir imaging and spectroscopy we are analyzing to better constrain the star formation history and dust content than we have been able to do here using just the optical data .",
    "these more detailed analyses will be the subjects of future papers that will exploit the rich follow - up data set that can be derived from this very bright high - redshift lensing system .",
