    "quantum information devices based on the circuit quantum electrodynamics ( cqed ) platform are now reaching a level of complexity that demands careful attention to the challenges of connectorization , addressability , and isolation of constituent components .",
    "solutions will ideally allow for dense packing of components and routing of control and readout circuitry while protecting the coherence of quantum states and maintaining the performance of numerous integrated elements .",
    "the semiconductor industry has already solved similar challenges in the classical domain .",
    "an exciting prospect is adapting these known methods of 3d integration and packaging for rf components@xcite to scale - up quantum circuits .",
    "we envision using micromachining , the bulk etching of silicon wafers , to embed cqed components within a multi - wafer construction ( fig.[seampart]a ) containing many superconducting qubits , memories , buses , and amplifiers .",
    "therefore , we have proposed a hardware platform called the multilayer microwave integrated quantum circuit ( mmiqc).@xcite micromachined enclosures , which have been demonstrated in normal metal rf circuitry@xcite , are highly useful in such a device stack if extended to superconducting coatings .",
    "they can suppress cross - talk and radiation loss in circuits , or constitute cavity resonators that can serve as quantum memories .",
    "both applications will require 3d superconducting enclosures that are very low - loss , despite highly - confined electric fields and surface currents .    in this letter , we show that it is crucial to achieve a superconducting bond between micromachined layers in order to achieve a low - loss enclosure .",
    "further , we demonstrate that indium can fulfill this objective .",
    "we first describe a model that allows us to quantify the dissipation that a seam introduces to a cavity mode .",
    "we then present measurements of traditionally machined cavity resonators with several materials , dimensions and seam locations chosen to elucidate the seam as a loss mechanism .",
    "these measurements reveal that indium can yield high quality factors ( @xmath0 ) and form a superconducting bond for various types of enclosures . combining this finding with established fabrication techniques , we have created superconducting micromachined cavities . as we describe , such devices are particularly susceptible to loss at seams , but with indium , they can achieve quality factors of up to two million .",
    "they can also be coupled with planar techniques , making them compatible with future multi - wafer stacks containing cqed experiments .",
    "in addition to dielectric and conductor losses @xcite , a cavity assembled from two conductors can experience loss from an imperfect seam.@xcite currents crossing the joint between two superconducting walls encounter a discontinuity due to microscopic voids , oxides or other surface impurities .",
    "therefore , the types of cavities that are commonly used in cqed experiments @xcite are designed to mitigate seam losses ( fig .",
    "[ seampart]b ) .",
    "these cavities are assembled from two symmetric halves , split along a plane e shown in fig .",
    "[ seampart]c .",
    "the cavity s",
    "te@xmath1 modes ideally have no currents crossing the seam for this configuration ( fig . [ seampart]d ) .",
    "other cavity resonators that have this property include the te@xmath2 mode of a cylindrical cavity@xcite , coaxial quarter - wave cavities@xcite , as well as cavities constructed by extruding methods , such as hydroforming",
    ". however , none of these cavity constructions are practical for wafer - processing .",
    "mmiqcs constitutive micromachined enclosures ( fig .",
    "[ seampart]a ) are etched into silicon wafers and have seams that experience large currents : those parallel to plane h in figure  [ seampart]c .",
    "we now quantify the dependence of seam losses on the cavity geometry .",
    "we model the seam as a distributed port around a path @xmath3 with a total length @xmath4 and total conductance @xmath5 .",
    "the cavity fields are accompanied by surface currents @xmath6 that may pass across the seam and dissipate power @xmath7 if it is damped solely by seam losses , a cavity mode of frequency @xmath8 and total energy @xmath9 has a quality factor @xmath10 given by @xmath11 = \\frac{y_{seam}}{g_{seam}},\\ ] ] where the field @xmath12 is integrated over the volume @xmath13 of the mode and @xmath14 is the magnetic permeability .",
    "we identify the expression in square brackets as the admittance , @xmath15 , of the cavity presented to the seam .",
    "this admittance is zero when the seam is placed such that there are no perpendicular surface currents . in order to compare intrinsic seam properties in different cavity constructions , we introduce the conductance per unit length @xmath16 and admittance per unit length @xmath17 . using this model , we can associate @xmath18 with the seam location and cavity fields and @xmath19 with materials properties in the seam region .    from these equations and the known fields of the te101 mode ( fig .",
    "[ seampart]d ) , we see that plane h of figure  1c maximizes @xmath18 . however , this orientation of seam is the natural consequence of the micromachining process @xcite .",
    "therefore , for a low - loss micromachined cavity , it is imperative to develop a method of wafer - scale superconducting bonding that maximizes @xmath19 . by measuring several seam - limited quality factors",
    ", we can extract values of @xmath19 for cavities bonded using different materials and techniques .",
    "fig . [ plot ] presents several measurements of quality factors for rectangular waveguide cavity resonators .",
    "these devices were machined in bulk metal to various geometries and assembled with several seam locations to study the effect different @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , various materials were used : 6061 aluminum alloy ( black circles ) , aluminum of @xmath20n purity ( grey triangle ) , or electroplated indium ( blue squares / diamond ) , to study how material choices contribute to @xmath19 . in the following ,",
    "we describe the cavities in order of increasing seam participation .",
    "we begin with a rectangular cavity geometry similar to those used in 3d cqed experiments@xcite , assembled in two halves that meet at a seam in plane e ( fig .",
    "[ seampart]b , c , fig . [ plot]a ) .",
    "machining imprecision of @xmath21 2 mils may cause deviation from the ideal @xmath22 . in bulk",
    "al , these cavities typically have @xmath23 .",
    "pure ( @xmath20n ) al cavities , when chemically etched , have higher @xmath24 due to reduced surface loss .",
    "the same cavity geometry was also machined in ofhc cu and electroplated with in to a thickness of 100 @xmath25 m before assembly .",
    "the resulting quality factor of @xmath26 exceeded that of the al 4n cavity .",
    "our cavity measurements place a bound on indium s surface quality , described in ref . @xcite as the ratio of a superconductor s surface reactance to surface resistance , of @xmath27 .",
    "next , we describe measurements performed on rectangular cavities with seam participation intentionally increased .",
    "we machined the mating parts in al alloy to have either a 5% or 10% asymmetry along their length such that , once assembled , the e - plane seam was not centered ( fig . [ plot]b ) . the increased @xmath18 is accompanied by 60% and 85% reductions in @xmath24 compared to the cavity with symmetric e - plane seam .",
    "we also constructed cavities of similar dimensions with seams in the h - plane ( fig .",
    "[ plot]c ) .",
    "al cavities with h - plane seams ( fig .",
    "[ plot]c ) had quality factors limited to @xmath28 . in an identical geometry , we observe that cavities constructed from cu components electroplated with in had quality factors three orders of magnitude greater ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the cavities with the most seam participation , located on the right side of figure  [ plot ] , are metal cavities made with a height of 300 @xmath25 m , which is feasible to micromachine in a wafer ( fig .",
    "[ plot]d ) .",
    "in addition to the discussed sensitivity to seam losses , these thin cavities are also more sensitive to surface and conductor losses when compared to larger cavities , with participation ratios scaling inversely with cavity height .",
    "it is clear from our measurements , however , that the dominant loss mechanism for these al cavities is related to the seam .",
    "we conclude that the in - plated cu cavities have a @xmath19 far exceeding that of the al cavities . taking @xmath30 as a likely limit for the al alloy cavities",
    ", this implies an average total conductance of the seams of these cavities of @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "however , the measured in cavities , with equal @xmath18 posses a higher conductance @xmath32 , meaning that the total conductance of an in seam cavity can be at least as high as @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "we attribute this difference to a comparably weak surface oxide .",
    "another factor may be indium s higher ductility , which is maintained at cryogenic temperatures.@xcite in addition to enhanced seam quality , these measurements also indicate that thick in film has a high surface quality .",
    "having explored the properties of electroplated indium as a superconducting bonding material using metallic prototypes , we now turn to cavities fabricated in wafers .",
    "compatible with mmiqcs , silicon wafers are etched to form recesses which are then electroplated with indium to form cavities .",
    "details of the fabrication process are described in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for initial testing ,",
    "an in - plated si chip with etched cavity pit was bonded to a block of in - plated cu containing a sub - cutoff waveguide for pin coupling in a manner identical to the 3d cavities machined in bulk metal .",
    "this bond provided both the mechanical and electrical integrity of the micromachined cavity construction , and can result in a @xmath24 exceeding @xmath34 ( fig .",
    "[ plot ] , blue diamond ) .",
    "a coupling scheme that is more compatible with a multilayer architecture is achieved using a coplanar waveguide or microstrip to access the fields of the resonator through an aperture in the cavity wall , as described in refs .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ umachine ] , we present a superconducting micomachined cavity with planar coupling , consisting of an etched cavity mated with a printed circuit board ( pcb ) top chip . of several devices with various designed couplings@xcite ,",
    "we report a best @xmath24 of @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "though it exceeds what could be achieved for an al coating , this result is inconsistent with quality factors shown to be possible in this geometry , and we attribute it to seam loss .",
    "we suspect that there is both an oxide barrier and voids in the seam due to imperfect indium electroplating and a non - optimized bonding procedure .",
    "furthermore , we suspect that the integrity of the bonds suffers from a mismatch in the thermal contraction of different materials that we do not expect in future multilayer si devices .",
    "from this investigation , we conclude that while micromachined cavities are sensitive to seam losses , high - quality superconducting bonds are possible with the proper selection and treatment of materials .",
    "our results suggest that indium is a low loss ( @xmath37 ) and viable superconducting bonding material for a multilayer cqed hardware platform .",
    "this bond quality ( @xmath32 ) could likely be improved significantly by incorporating techniques such as surface passivation , heating , and precise alignment that are standard in industrial bump bonding@xcite .",
    "the rf loss properties of superconducting interconnects and wafer - scale bonds produced with these techniques @xcite is a topic of current investigation .",
    "micromachining cavity resonators with the process described here offers the advantages of lithographic precision and ease of integration with planar circuitry .",
    "we have demonstrated planar fabrication of inter - layer coupling to a micromachined cavity .",
    "similar rf interconnects can mediate couplings in an indium bonded stack of silicon wafers with multiple resonators and other quasi-3d and planar elements.@xcite the micromachined device presented here is an important step towards developing fabrication strategies necessary for scalable quantum computing.@xcite",
