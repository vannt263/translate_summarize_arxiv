    "models of multiple partonic collisions in high energy hadron - hadron scattering are important for simulations of complex events in upcoming experiments like those at the lhc or in high energy cosmic ray air showers .",
    "furthermore , measurements of the rate of multiple partonic collisions can be used to test current models of proton structure .",
    "already , measurements at accessible energies  @xcite yield a much smaller effective cross section @xmath0 than what is naively expected if partons are homogeneously distributed over the transverse area of the proton .",
    "( figure  [ fig : doublescat ] shows a schematic depiction of a double partonic collision . )",
    "the definition of @xmath0 is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the inclusive cross section for a single partonic collision ( resulting in a dijet ) , @xmath3 is the inclusive cross section for a double collision , and @xmath4 is a symmetry factor that depends on whether the partons are identical .",
    "new measurements of multiple collisions are currently being proposed for the lhc  @xcite .",
    "hence , novel new phenomena involving multiple hard partonic collisions , which will enhance understanding of proton structure , can be expected in the next generation of experiments at the high energy frontier .",
    "however , multiple interactions involve a complex interplay of soft , hard , and semihard physics , so a complete description using purely perturbative techniques is not possible . in simulations of complex hadronic final states , methods are needed for combining hard and soft collisions in a consistent way .",
    "( for an overview of current approaches see , e.g.  @xcite , and references therein . )",
    "the hard contribution is calculated using the well - known perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) leading twist factorization formula for the inclusive dijet production cross section , involving a convolution of the standard parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) with a partonic cross section .",
    "an immediate complication is that , in order for perturbation theory to be applicable , the relative transverse momentum of the produced jets must be larger than some minimum cutoff scale @xmath5 .",
    "the cutoff should be chosen small so as to maximize the range of the perturbative expression , but still large enough for perturbative methods to be reasonable . for describing events with transverse momentum less than @xmath5 ,",
    "nonperturbative methods are needed .",
    "a prescription for matching the high and low transverse momentum behavior is necessary for a complete description over the full range of transverse momentum .",
    "the inclusive pqcd hard dijet cross section is numerically very sensitive to the precise choice of @xmath5 .",
    "this has a tendency to lead to substantial variations between different model predictions of the minijet cross section at high energies .",
    "the question of what values of @xmath5 are appropriate continues to be discussed in current research on the development of models and simulations ( see , for example , recent discussions in  @xcite ) .",
    "an additional complication is that a description is needed for the distribution of hard partons in impact parameter space . in the past",
    ", it has usually been modeled or assumed to be equal to the electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon .",
    "also , in a number of models , soft and hard partonic interactions are incorporated into a single eikonal picture . in this way",
    ", both soft and hard interactions are included in a way that respects @xmath6-channel unitarity .",
    "data for the total and inelastic @xmath7 cross sections can then be used to fit parameters such as @xmath5 and the width of the distribution of hard partons in impact parameter space . however , different choices for these parameters can provide equally good fits to the total cross section at accessible energies while leading to very different extrapolations at high energies ( see , for example , ref .  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it is important to make use of any experimental or observational information that can narrow the range of allowed parameters and falsify some of the models currently in use .",
    "it is nowadays possible to use pqcd to obtain direct experimental information about the transverse spread of hard partons in the proton via parametrizations of the generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein for a review of the phenomenology of gpds . ) the gluon gpd of the proton , for example , can be extracted from measurements of the @xmath8 dependence in deep inelastic production of light vector mesons or photoproduction of heavy vector mesons  @xcite .",
    "then , since the gpd is a universal object  @xcite , it can be reused in other processes . in particular , it can be used in the description of the impact parameter dependence of hard collisions in hadron - hadron scattering . as such",
    ", we adopt the point of view in this paper that the impact parameter description of a hard collision is not an adjustable model parameter , but rather is fixed by fits to the gluon gpd .    an accurate description of the impact parameter dependence is important because it allows for a measure of how close the hard interaction is to the unitarity ( or `` saturation '' ) limit .",
    "furthermore , the proximity to the unitarity limit is related to the number of high transverse momentum jets that are produced , and hence to the use of centrality as a dijet trigger  @xcite . however , as was illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , using gpds to describe the impact parameter dependence of hard collisions within the approximation where partons are not correlated in the transverse plane ( which is implemented in the simplest eikonal description ) leads to inconsistencies with general expectations for the extrapolation of the total inelastic profile function to high energies , unless a large value is used for the transverse momentum cutoff @xmath5 . specifically , the contribution to the total inelastic profile function from the production of hard dijet pairs becomes larger than the total inelastic profile function itself .",
    "although the inclusive dijet cross section is unitarized in the basic eikonal description , it nevertheless grows too rapidly with energy . as we will argue , this problem is most likely a symptom of the common assumption that partons are uncorrelated .",
    "the study of correlations in multiple hard collisions is already an active area of research  @xcite .",
    "implementations of dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - alterelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution in multiparton distribution functions suggest that correlations are indeed significant  @xcite .",
    "correlations may also be induced by evolution in bjorken @xmath9  @xcite in the very high energy limit .",
    "however , numerical estimates in ref .",
    "@xcite suggest that hard unitarity ( saturation ) effects contribute to only a small fraction of the total inclusive dijet cross section , even at lhc energies .",
    "moreover , the inconsistencies encountered in ref .",
    "@xcite occur even at large impact parameters , @xmath10  fm , and values of @xmath5 that are not particularly small , e.g. @xmath11  gev .",
    "in the instanton liquid model ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) one can expect a strong correlation between the quark and gluon fields in the constituent quarks which will result in correlations at all impact parameters",
    ". it may be somewhat diluted at large @xmath12 due to the contribution from the @xmath13 component .",
    "on the other hand for partons at large enough distances from the center it is likely that another parton should be present at a distance comparable to the confinement scale , leading to correlations of @xmath14 pairs at relative distances @xmath15 that are rather small which could easily compensate for the dilution effect .",
    "therefore , it is likely that nonperturbative correlations , unrelated to the overall impact parameter , play a role in determining the size of the dijet contribution to the total inelastic cross section .",
    "heuristically , one can imagine scattering at large impact parameters as the scattering of pion clouds .",
    "the nonperturbative dynamics responsible for binding the @xmath16 pairs introduces potentially large correlations .",
    "collinear constituents of the incoming protons are expected , on average , to have a spacetime separation of order @xmath17 .",
    "because of the breakdown of asymptotic freedom at these scales , it should be anticipated that the constituents of the nucleon are subject to strong nonperturbative correlations . in other words",
    ", one should not expect the multiparton distribution functions to be simply related to products of the single parton distribution function at any scale .    as a specific illustration ,",
    "let us consider the double parton event in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublescat ] .",
    "if @xmath18 is the distribution function for parton pairs with momentum fractions @xmath19 and @xmath20 inside proton @xmath21 , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the standard pdfs , then an often made ansatz is @xmath24 in some treatments of correlations this relation follows after an integration over impact parameters , even if the factorization ansatz is broken in impact parameter space .",
    "the question marks in eq .",
    "( [ eq : badapprox ] ) indicate that we will question the validity of this assumption .",
    "given the strong binding between the constituent partons in the proton , the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : badapprox ] ) is probably very rough at any scale .",
    "we will argue that deviations can have an important effect on extrapolations to high energies .    for a large cutoff @xmath5",
    ", the inclusive dijet cross section gives a small fraction of the total inelastic cross section , and there is no conflict with @xmath6-channel unitarity .",
    "what is needed at smaller @xmath5 is a method for organizing correlation corrections which does not rely on the commonly used assumption that correlations can be neglected .",
    "to summarize , the aim of this paper is to set up a method for organizing corrections to the uncorrelated approach at small @xmath5 .",
    "we will use this to simultaneously incorporate the following information into a description of multiple hard partonic collision :    * the impact parameter distribution of hard partons obtained from measurements of the gluon gpd .",
    "the width of the distribution of hard partons is not a fixable parameter in our approach . *",
    "an estimate of the size of double parton correlations obtained from measurements @xmath0 . in this paper",
    ", we will assume that these correlations are roughly independent of impact parameter .    from this information",
    ", we will reconstruct the hard dijet contribution to the total inelastic profile function .",
    "compared with the uncorrelated expression , the result obtained with correlations will be shown to exhibit greater consistency with common high energy extrapolations of the total inelastic cross section , even with a relatively small and fixed value for @xmath5 in the perturbative inclusive dijet calculation .",

    "<S> we propose a simple method for incorporating correlations into the impact parameter space description of multiple ( semi-)hard partonic collisions in high energy hadron - hadron scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbative qcd input is the standard factorization theorem for inclusive dijet production with a lower cutoff on transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the width of the transverse distribution of hard partons is fixed by parameterizations of the two - gluon form factor . </S>",
    "<S> we then reconstruct the hard contribution to the total inelastic profile function and obtain corrections due to correlations to the more commonly used eikonal description . </S>",
    "<S> estimates of the size of double correlation corrections are based on the rate of double collisions measured at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , if typical values for the lower transverse momentum cutoff are used in the calculation of the inclusive hard dijet cross section , then the correlation corrections are necessary for maintaining consistency with expectations for the total inelastic proton - proton cross section at lhc energies . </S>"
