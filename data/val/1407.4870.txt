    "in recent years , a smart grid has attracted a tremendous amount of research interest due to its potential benefit to modern civilization .",
    "the remarkable development of computer and communication technology has enabled a realization of smart power grid .",
    "a key feature of a smart power grid is the change of the power distribution characteristics from a centralized power system to a distributed power system .",
    "though centralized power plants still cover the major portion of power demand , the amount of power demand covered by distributed power resources has been increasing steadily @xcite .    in distributed power systems , achieving the supply - demand balance , which is one of the fundamental requirements , is a key challenging issue due to its decentralized characteristics . the supply - demand balance problem has been traditionally considered as the economic dispatch @xcite which minimizes the total cost of operation of generation systems . however , the traditional dispatch problem is a highly nonlinear optimization problem and thus it has been addressed usually in a centralized manner .",
    "distributed control of distributed power systems has been considered in @xcite . in the distributed power system ,",
    "individual power resources are interconnected with each other through communication and transmission line .",
    "thus , for the coordination of power generation and power flow , sharing information is essential .",
    "it is more realistic and economic to use only local information .",
    "this kind of problem has been solved in consensus @xcite .",
    "distributed resource allocation method named `` center - free algorithm '' has been considered in @xcite . in the algorithm ,",
    "since the amount of resource for each node is determined by the sum of weighted difference with its neighbors , we can easily see the equivalence of the algorithm to the consensus .",
    "thus , we can consider that the idea of consensus had been already used in the distributed resource allocation problems .    in this paper , power distribution among distributed power resources",
    "is studied .",
    "the problem is classified into three subproblems . in the first problem , which is called _ power coordination _ ,",
    "the desired net power is determined . in the second problem and the third problem ,",
    "we consider power generation and power flow control of distributed power resources with and without power coordination respectively .",
    "note that the power flow control without power coordination is significantly important when the net power and the generation capacities of each power resource are limited .",
    "consensus schemes are employed to generate power coordination , power generation and power flow control signals .",
    "subsequently , the main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the coordination and control of power generation and power flow are precisely defined and formulated .",
    "second , two power distribution schemes with and without power coordination are developed , which may be helpful in coordinating actual power generation and power flow among distributed power plants .",
    "the proposed approach deals with the desired net power which is not necessarily an average value as in the distributed averaging problem @xcite .",
    "third , it is shown that the distributed consensus algorithms ensure power distribution among distributed nodes that have net power and generation capacity constraints .",
    "the proposed approach can be applied even if the desired net power of some power resources does not satisfy the power generation capacity as opposed to those in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_prob_form ] , power coordination ,",
    "power generation and power flow control problems are formulated .",
    "main results of this paper are presented in section [ sec_main_res ] .",
    "illustrative examples are provided in section [ sec_example ] and the conclusion is given in section [ sec_conc ] , respectively .",
    "1 shows a graph representing interconnected power systems .",
    "each node denotes a subsystem , i.e. , an area that consists of generators and loads , and it has its power demand determined by its loads .",
    "thus , the desired net power for each generator in the subsystem is required to be determined .",
    "the power can be transmitted to its neighboring subsystems since they are interconnected with each other through transmission lines . in this paper",
    ", we would like to control the power generation and power flow to satisfy supply - demand balance under net power and generation capacity constraints .",
    "let @xmath0 be the desired net power at the @xmath1-th node ; @xmath2 be the generated power at the @xmath1-th node ; and @xmath3 be the power flow from the @xmath1-th node to the @xmath4-th node , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the net power at a node is determined after the net power exchange of generated powers with its neighbor nodes .",
    "thus , the net power at the @xmath1-th node can be defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the set of neighbor nodes of the @xmath1-th node .",
    "the total generated power and total power demand within the power grid are represented by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we need the following assumption to represent a reality of power grid network systems .",
    "[ assump ]    1 .",
    "each node has the net power capacity constraint such as @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates the sampling instant of the physical power layer .",
    "the net power capacity is associated with the amount of power that each node can handle .",
    "thus , the desired net power for each node shall be limited by the net power capacity constraint .",
    "2 .   each node has the generation capacity constraint such as @xmath13 the generation capacity is also assumed to be bounded by the net power capacity constraint i.e. , @xmath14 \\subseteq \\left [ { \\underline { { p_i } } , \\overline { { p_i } } } \\right]$ ] .",
    "the graph which represents interconnections among nodes is undirected and connected .",
    "this assumption comes from the fact that the power and information flows are bidirectional .",
    "however , this assumption can be relaxed to a directed graph .",
    "note that due to the constraints and in the _ assumption [ assump ] _ , the power coordination and power flow control problems become non - trivial .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows a power exchange between pairs of nodes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the generated power and the net power at each node can be represented as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is its own variation in power generation and @xmath17 is the interaction term representing the power exchange between two nodes .",
    "[ t ]     to make the paper clear , the following problems are formally stated .",
    "[ prob1 ] _",

    "thus , it is assumed that the total power demand is given as usually assumed in traditional power dispatch problems .",
    "as shown in below , only one node is required to know the total power demand .",
    "thus , the desired net power for each node is determined by power coordination , and power generation is controlled to meet the supply - demand balance .",

    "thus , it is assumed that the desired net power is individually given to each node .",
    "thus , power coordination is not necessary , but the power generation and power flow are controlled to meet the supply - demand balance and given - individual desired net power for each node simultaneously .",
    "this scenario is formulated under the name of `` without power coordination '' .",
    "power system transmission lines have a very high @xmath24 ratio .",
    "thus , the real power changes are primarily dependent on phase angle differences among generators while they are relatively not affected by voltages .",
    "further , the phase angle dynamics is generally much faster than the voltage dynamics and thus it is usually assumed that the phase angle dynamics and the voltage dynamics are decoupled @xcite . in our problem setup , since we deal with the real power , one can see that the phase angle is implicitly considered . also ,",
    "in this paper , we mainly concentrate on power distribution , transmission , and coordination issues in operation level .",
    "thus , the lower level signal characteristics are not considered .",
    "also , it is assumed that power flow information can be calculated from the sequence of voltage and current phasors obtained by phasor measurement units ( pmus ) @xcite .    the problem formulated by ( [ eq8 ] ) , ( [ eq9 ] ) , and ( [ eq10 ] ) can cover various attribute distribution problems such as gas , water and oil operation , and supply chain management , traffic control , and renewable energy allocation .",
    "this paper just focuses on power distribution problem , which has been recently more researched @xcite .",
    "in the power coordination , a desired net power is required to be realizable @xcite , i.e. , physical constraints such as generation capacity and power flow constraint are required to be satisfied .",
    "if the desired net power does not satisfy these constraints , we can not achieve the control goal with any control input since the desired net power is not realizable . from and",
    ", the following condition for a realization ( i.e. , to make the desired net power realizable ) can be obtained : @xmath25 let us consider the power coordination issue more systematically .",
    "if the desired net power is both upper- and lower - bounded , then we can make the following rule for the power coordination .",
    "if the desired net power is lower - bounded and upper - bounded , i.e. , @xmath26 and is satisfied , then the following desired net power @xmath27 provides a sufficient condition for the supply - demand balance .",
    "if @xmath28 is given by , then , under the assumption , we have @xmath29 which satisfies the left - side inequality @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , if @xmath31 is given by , then , under the assumption , we obtain @xmath32 thus , the right - side inequality @xmath33 is also satisfied .",
    "furthermore , summing up the both sides of over @xmath1 from @xmath34 to @xmath35 yields @xmath36    note that the power coordination requires global information such as @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    ". the coordination scheme can be , however , achieved by distributed consensus algorithm using only local information as in @xcite .",
    "for that , we need the following lemma for a further investigation .",

    "the consensus algorithm ( [ eq23])-([eq27 ] ) is completely decoupled from the physical power layer .    without loss of generality",

    "this paper has addressed power distribution problems in distributed power grid with and without power coordination .",
    "first , a power coordination using a consensus scheme under limited net power and power generation capacities was considered .",
    "second , power generation and a power flow control laws with and without power coordination were designed using a consensus scheme to achieve supply - demand balance . since",
    "this paper has provided systematic approaches for power distribution among distributed nodes on the basis of consensus algorithms , the results of this paper can be nicely utilized in power dispatch or power flow scheduling .",
    "the authors believe that consensus algorithm - based power distribution schemes of this paper have several advantages over typical power dispatch approaches .",
    "the first key advantage is that the power coordination and control can be realized via decentralized control scheme without relying upon nonlinear optimization technique .",
    "the second advantage is that the framework proposed in this paper can handle power constraint , generation , and flow in a unified framework .",
    "it is noticeable that this paper has considered the power coordination , power generation and power flow control in the higher - level models of grid networks but does not consider lower - level models of grid networks such as current , voltage drop , and line impedance .",
    "however , in our future research , it would be meaningful to add links between the higher - level models and the lower - level models .",
    "further , it is desirable to investigate various features such as behavior of self - interested customer , power loss in the transmission line , and structures between the physical and cyber layers such as delays , and mismatches between them .",
    "though the paper has only focused on power distribution , we believe that the proposed approach can be extended to various attribute distribution problems such as traffic control and supply chain management , because we use a fundamental model describing flow of attribute between pairs of distributed resources as well as the amount of attribute in each distributed resource .",
    "for example , in a traffic control , each freeway section named `` cell '' corresponds to each distributed power resource , distribution of vehicle density corresponds to net power of each power resource , desired traffic density corresponds to desired net power , and on - ramp traffic flow corresponds to power generation control input .",
    "thus , the goal of traffic control which satisfies desired traffic density corresponds to that of power distribution which satisfies desired net power .",
