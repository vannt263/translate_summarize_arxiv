    "for these so - called hindered transitions the amplitude is highly suppressed and depends on the interplay of small effects coming from spin - dependent interactions , effects of recoil and relativistic corrections@xcite .",
    "the use of lattice qcd methods to calculate the amplitude for vector meson radiative decays was suggested long ago @xcite .",
    "recently , interest in this application of lattice qcd has been revived and charmonium has been studied in detail @xcite .",

    "our lattice has 64 time sites but it is not useful to construct correlators over the entire time extent .",
    "the correlators are limited to maximum time separation @xmath33 of 27 .",
    "since the maximum time separation is considerably smaller than the lattice time extent and the nonrelativistic propagators depend only on the gauge field links on time slices between source and sink it is very effective to use multiple time sources on each gauge configuration .",
    "sixteen sources , uniformly distributed in time , were used in this calculation . to further reduce statistical fluctuations a random wall source ( see , for example , @xcite ) was used .",
    "in addition to zero - momentum pseudoscalar and vector meson correlators , pseudoscalar correlators with momentum corresponding to ( 1,0,0 ) and ( 2,0,0 ) were calculated .",

    "it is a common feature for lattice simulations of heavy quark systems to underestimate the spin splitting and some issues have been discussed in the context of lattice nrqcd in recent studies@xcite .    a popular way to determine excited state energies",
    "is the variational method@xcite ( for an extensive recent discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "the correlator matrix is diagonalized at each time and the time - dependent eigenvalues then give an optimal estimate of the time evolution of individual states .",
    "the evolution is calculated with respect to some reference time @xmath42 which should be chosen large enough so that the number of basis operators is comparable to the number of contributing states .",

    "the decay width can be expressed in terms of the wavefunction at the origin @xmath47 as ( see @xcite ) @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the electromagnetic coupling constant and the matching factor @xmath50 relates the lattice vector current to the renormalized continuum current . with nonrelativistic normalization of states",

    "the @xmath55 to @xmath56 matrix element decreases only very slowly with recoil momentum which reflects the small size of bottomonium .",
    "the excited state to ground - state transitions have matrix elements that are small in magnitude due to near orthogonality of wavefunctions . the relative negative sign of @xmath58 and @xmath59 reflects the fact that the dominant spin - dependent quark antiquark interaction acts with different sign in pseudoscalar and vector states .",
    "the recoil effect contributes positively to all transitions ( see , for example , @xcite ) which explains the momentum dependence .",
    "the calculated matrix elements are large compared to the empirical values inferred from the measured partial widths",

    "there are other systematics that we can not deal with quantitatively but which it is reasonable to think are small .",
    "bottomonium has only heavy valence quarks so extrapolation to the physical point for up and down quarks comes in only through the influence of sea quarks on the gauge field . since the simulation is done very near the physical point , with quarks which give a pion mass of 156mev , it would be surprising if a simulation at the physical point would be much different .",
    "finite volume can also lead to a significant systematic effect in lattice simulations but is unlikely to be the case here .",
    "the size of bottomonium is much smaller than the spatial lattice size so finite volume effects arise indirectly through light quarks in the sea .",
