    "the ` fine tuning ' problems of the friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology favour the possibility that the universe is spatially flat with density parameter @xmath0 , as would result naturally from an inflationary phase in the early universe @xcite .",
    "however , the observed abundance of deuterium , which could only have been formed during big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite , implies an upper bound of @xmath1 on the nucleonic contribution to the density parameter @xcite . since the hubble parameter @xmath2 is in the range @xmath3 , ordinary matter can not close the universe and this discrepancy has motivated the much discussed idea that non - baryonic dark matter makes up the difference . today @xcite ; therefore we distinguish between baryons and nucleons in the context of bbn .",
    "] this would require the existence of new _",
    "stable _ massive particles in extensions of physics beyond the standard model , e.g. massive neutrinos or the lightest supersymmetric particle @xcite .",
    "it is clearly important to establish whether there are any loopholes in this argument , especially since nucleons _ can _ in principle make up all the dynamically detected dark matter which amounts to only @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent observations of microlensing of stars in the _ large magellanic cloud _ indicate that @xmath5 objects ( probably old white dwarfs ) can already account for upto half of the dark matter in the halo of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "there have been several proposals for relaxing the bbn bound on the nucleon density by either modifying general relativity @xcite , or complicating the standard picture of nucleosynthesis , e.g. by invoking non - zero neutrino chemical potentials @xcite or inhomogeneities in the nucleon distribution resulting from a first - order quark - hadron phase transition @xcite .",
    "the latter possibility is physically the best motivated but detailed studies show that even with new free parameters it is difficult to permit the critical density in nucleons @xcite .",
    "there have also been suggestions which invoke physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "one requires a tau neutrino with a mass of 2030  mev ( but with its relic abundance suppressed by a factor of @xmath6 below the nominal ` freeze - out ' value ) decaying ` invisibly ' into electron neutrinos with a lifetime of 2001000  sec @xcite .",
    "although this would allow a @xmath7 universe , the model is rather fine - tuned and quite unlikely from the particle physics viewpoint ; in particular the @xmath8 must have its tree - level standard model decays ( @xmath9 ) totally suppressed as these would disrupt nucleosynthesis @xcite ; moreover the required mass region is now almost ruled out experimentally @xcite .",
    "a better motivated suggestion @xcite is that the hadronic and radiation cascades triggered by the decay after bbn of massive unstable particles such as gravitinos can process the elemental yields so as to synthesize adequate amounts of deuterium even for @xmath10 .",
    "however , there is a problem with the abundance of @xmath11li , which , in this model , is nearly as abundant as @xmath12li , in apparent conflict with observations @xcite .",
    "( the same comment applies to the model invoking hawking radiation from primordial black holes @xcite . )    in this paper we consider another exotic idea due to bartlett and hall @xcite viz .  that our universe ( the ` visible ' sector ) may have become coupled to a ` hidden ' sector through a phase transition after nucleosynthesis .",
    "the mixing of photons in the visible sector with their counterpart ` paraphotons ' in the hidden sector can then result in a sudden _ decrease _ of the comoving photon density .",
    "thus the universe may well have the critical density in nucleons today , while having a nucleon - to - photon ratio during bbn consistent with observed elemental abundances . to see this",
    "we note that the nucleon mass density in ratio to the critical density is @xmath13 where the present temperature of the blackbody cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is @xmath14k ( 95@xmath15 c.l . )",
    ". therefore we require @xmath16 for a critical density in nucleons , where @xmath17k . in the standard cosmology ,",
    "the comoving entropy does not change after @xmath18 annihilation so the nucleon - to - photon ratio during nucleosynthesis equals its value today , i.e. @xmath19 . as mentioned earlier , the observational lower limit to the abundance of deuterium ( together with observational upper limits to the abundances of helium and lithium ) requires @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the interesting possibility suggested in ref.@xcite is that the comoving photon number _ decreases _ following nucleosynthesis , so that @xmath21 is raised to @xmath22 and can be as high as @xmath23 .",
    "we examine the effects of such physics on various cosmological and astrophysical processes such as bbn itself , the spectrum of the cmb and stellar evolution .",
    "it turns out that these arguments severely constrain but can not quite rule out the scenario .",
    "however , _ all _ models in which the critical density is comprised entirely by baryons ( nucleonic or otherwise ) are shown to be definitively excluded by recent measurements of anisotropy in the cmb together with measurements of the power spectrum of large - scale structure ( lss ) in the universe .",
    "thus , there appears to be no alternative to non - baryonic dark matter if indeed @xmath24 .",
    "first we briefly review the scenario of bartlett and hall @xcite .",
    "they consider a gauge theory with the group @xmath25 at energies far above the electroweak scale ( @xmath26gev ) .",
    "the group @xmath27 contains the standard @xmath28 model while @xmath29 corresponds to a hidden sector with no tree - level renormalizable couplings to known particles although similar in its symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "in particular @xmath29 breaks to a group which includes a hidden ( unbroken ) electromagnetism @xmath30 at a scale @xmath31 and the @xmath32 light degrees of freedom in @xmath29 ( generically termed @xmath33 ) acquire a mass at this scale .",
    "the cosmology is thus quite novel . the lightest ` connector ' particle ( carrying both @xmath27 and @xmath29 quantum numbers ) has a mass @xmath34 so that scattering processes involving the connector particles maintain the two sectors in thermal equilibrium at @xmath35 . at lower temperatures these reactions",
    "freeze - out and the two sectors decouple .",
    "subsequent phase transitions and annihilations of heavy species affect the sectors differently resulting in @xmath36 .",
    "( for example if the temperature difference is dominantly due to heavy particle annihilations in the visible sector then @xmath37 at @xmath38 @xcite . ) thus , during bbn the universe contains two plasmas which are not in thermal contact with each other . at some point after nucleosynthesis",
    "a ` recoupling ' reaction reestablishes thermal contact , cooling the photons in the visible sector and hence reducing the comoving photon number density .",
    "such a reaction requires a renormalizable interaction between photons and the @xmath33 particles in the hidden sector .",
    "indeed the particles @xmath33 can have a very small electric charge , which may arise naturally in a unified non - abelian gauge theory @xcite , so that the compton scattering reaction @xmath39 shown in figure  1 can recouple the two sectors .    the rate of this process may be estimated as follows .",
    "wave function mixing mediated through a one - loop diagram involving the connector particles generates a term @xmath40 in the lagrangian , where @xmath41 for @xmath42 and values of @xmath43 may be considered natural @xcite .",
    "after diagonalizing the kinetic terms , the interactions of the photons can be written in several alternative bases .",
    "let @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the currents , including the gauge coupling constants @xmath46 and @xmath47 , for u(1 ) and u(1)@xmath48 respectively .",
    "when only ordinary matter is relevant it is most convenient to write the corresponding lagrangian to order @xmath49 in the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is defined to be the field coupled to @xmath44 which creates `` our '' photon @xmath52 .",
    "( note that the quanta coupled to @xmath44 and @xmath45 are _ not _ orthogonal .",
    "thus the field @xmath53 does not create the shadow photon @xmath54 of the hidden sector ; this is done instead by a field @xmath55 . ) from eq.([lagrange ] ) we see that the hidden particles @xmath33 interact with the photon through a very small electromagnetic charge @xmath56 . for",
    "fermionic @xmath33 species the rate of the recoupling process is then @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 is a number of @xmath60 which comes from thermally averaging over the energy transfer .",
    "as we shall see , constraints from the cmb require the recoupling reaction to occur during the radiation - dominated era .",
    "the energy density of the universe is then dominated by the plasma in the visible sector .",
    "defining the recoupling temperature @xmath61 to be the temperature of our plasma when the recoupling rate equals the expansion rate gives @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the number of spin states ( assumed fermionic ) of the hidden plasma having interaction @xmath65 with @xmath54 . to calculate the resultant cooling of the visible sector it is assumed that the energy transfer occurs quickly compared with the expansion rate ;",
    "the final temperature @xmath66 is then obtained by demanding energy conservation at recoupling , i.e. @xmath67 .",
    "the energy density of the shadow sector should be negligible during bbn ( in order not to increase the expansion rate excessively ) but dominates after recoupling ( because @xmath68 ) which gives @xmath69 .",
    "therefore a critical density nucleonic universe ( see eq.([etacrit ] ) ) requires @xmath70 and , correspondingly , @xmath71 .",
    "subsequently the @xmath33 particles acquire mass through a phase transition with a critical temperature bounded as @xmath72 it would be natural to expect that @xmath73 is of @xmath74 .",
    "nucleosynthesis obviously provides an upper bound on the recoupling temperature since the abundances of the elements would be altered if it is too high . to study this ,",
    "we have modified the standard computer code @xcite to include an abrupt drop in temperature at @xmath61 when the recoupling reaction occurs . before this",
    ", the universe contains two plasmas which are not in thermal contact , the usual one characterized by the photon temperature @xmath75 ( consisting of @xmath52 , 3 @xmath76 s , @xmath77 , as well as nucleons ) , and the other one containing the shadow sector particles like @xmath54 and @xmath33 with temperature @xmath78 .",
    "an important parameter is the ratio of the shadow sector temperature to the neutrino temperature _ before _ recoupling , @xmath79 which stays constant during @xmath18 annihilation when the photon temperature @xmath80 increases ( but not @xmath78 or @xmath81 ) .",
    "it enables the energy density @xmath82 of the shadow sector before recoupling to be tracked using the neutrino energy density , @xmath83 , and is thus a more convenient parameter than @xmath84 as used in ref.@xcite .",
    "now at the recoupling temperature @xmath61 there is a sudden drop ( which would be smooth in a more detailed model ) to the final temperature @xmath66 .",
    "energy conservation gives @xmath85 where @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath89 for neutrinos , the corresponding terms above cancel and we obtain ( neglecting the electron energy density for the temperatures of relevance ) , @xmath90^{1/4}\\ , .\\ ] ] after recoupling the energy density of the shadow sector is just @xmath91 since now @xmath92 .    we have implemented a routine in the bbn code dividing the thermal history into the three steps ( before , during and after recoupling ) and compute the expansion rate accordingly , taking into account the contribution of shadow particles .",
    "we assume 3 light neutrino species , use the neutron lifetime @xmath93  s @xcite , and incorporate small corrections to the helium abundance as reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "since the main effect of photon cooling is to increase the helium-4 abundance and decrease the deuterium abundance , we bound their values from recent observations of helium in metal - poor extragalactic hii regions @xcite and of deuterium in the interstellar medium @xcite : @xmath94 we do not consider the bound on @xmath95 because it does not provide a useful constraint .",
    "the adopted bounds are very _ conservative _ , based upon consideration of a variety of data which are critically discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  2 , we can then derive the maximum value of @xmath61 allowed for each given set of parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the allowed region is : @xmath98 only part of which is shown in the figure for convenience .",
    "( the highest allowed value of @xmath97 corresponds to the smallest initial value of @xmath99 , viz .",
    "@xmath100 @xcite . ) for comparison , the values suggested in ref.@xcite were @xmath101  kev , @xmath102 and @xmath70 .",
    "a lower bound on the recoupling temperature follows from the observation by cobe that the cmb spectrum is accurately blackbody @xcite .",
    "the recoupling reaction _ removes _ photons from the thermal bath thus inducing a chemical potential for the photon distribution .",
    "if the reaction occurs early enough , however , photon creation processes can restore the planck spectrum @xcite in agreement with the observational upper limit @xcite on such a chemical potential : @xmath103 ( 95@xmath15 c.l . ) . to thus constrain @xmath61 we use a simple argument concerning the relevant time scales .    at temperatures below the @xmath18 threshold , the processes which determine the spectral shape are compton scattering ( c ) which preserves the photon number , and the radiative processes bremsstrahlung ( b ) and double compton scattering ( dc ) .",

    "( note that baryons and nucleons are equivalent with regard to the cmb since only their electromagnetic interactions are relevant ; therefore we henceforth refer to @xmath107 rather than @xmath108 . )",
    "the time scales above are to be compared with the age of the universe obtained by integrating the friedmann equation , @xmath109 & \\mbox{for } & t \\le t_{\\rm f}\\ .",

    "we show the various time scales for a typical set of parameters , with a sudden jump in @xmath99 as the temperature drops from @xmath61 to @xmath66 as determined by eq.([tfin ] ) .",
    "although bremsstrahlung usually dominates at low redshifts for a high density baryonic universe , the most efficient photon creation process is always found to be double compton scattering for the values of @xmath61 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 under consideration .",
    "the limiting value of the recoupling temperature is then conservatively obtained by demanding that the time scale for this be shorter than the expansion time scale .",
    "we have indicated in the figure the error bands for the time scales in eq.([scales ] ) corresponding to the allowed region of @xmath99 after nucleosynthesis , viz .",
    "@xmath111 @xcite . to obtain the minimum recoupling temperature we took the highest possible value for @xmath21 from eq.([etacrit ] ) and searched for the temperature at which @xmath112 is satisfied as a function of the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97",
    "; this gives @xmath113 combining the constraints from bbn and the cmb spectrum it follows that the recoupling temperature must be in the range @xmath114 for the allowed range of @xmath96 and @xmath97 as given in eq.([bbnresult ] ) .",
    "further constraints on the model follow from the energy loss argument for stars @xcite .",
    "for example if the @xmath33 particles are light enough to be produced in red giants through plasmon decays , a limit on @xmath115 ( eq.([alphatilde ] ) ) follows from requiring that the energy loss through @xmath33 emission does not affect the stellar luminosity or age to a noticeable degree @xcite .",
    "the resultant constraint is very stringent , viz .",
    "@xmath116 @xcite , and in conflict with the required value from eq.([alphatilde ] ) unless the recoupling temperature is very low .",
    "this , however , is not allowed by the cmb spectrum constraint ( eq.([trmin ] ) ) so the only escape route is to argue that the @xmath33 particles are too heavy to be produced in stars @xcite . in the cores of red giants",
    "the plasmon mass is @xmath117  kev , so this requires @xmath118  kev .",
    "there are additional contributions to @xmath33 production from compton and bremsstrahlung processes and to suppress these one would require @xmath119 where @xmath120  kev is the core temperature @xcite",
    ". or @xmath121 are not allowed by the lagrangian of eq.([lagrange ] ) ; if these existed , the associated energy loss could _ not _ be evaded by increasing @xmath73 .",
    "] however , if @xmath73 is indeed of @xmath122 then this implies @xmath123  kev ( see eq.([phasetran ] ) ) , which exceeds the upper limit from bbn over most of the parameter space ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus it would be necessary to invoke some fine - tuning and argue that @xmath124 .    an even more restrictive constraint on @xmath115 comes from supernova physics .",
    "after collapse , the supernova core forms a neutron star which radiates its binding energy primarily in the form of neutrinos which diffuse out of the dense central region over a time scale of seconds .",
    "observations of ( anti)neutrinos from _ sn1987a _",
    "@xcite confirmed that these indeed carried away @xmath125 erg on the expected time scale . a competing mechanism for cooling the core would be the production of @xmath33 particles through plasmon decays .",
    "then a conservative requirement is that the @xmath33 particles do not carry away more energy than the neutrinos and thus curtail the duration and energetics of the neutrino burst .",
    "assuming the core radius to be @xmath6  km and a cooling time of @xmath6  s one obtains for the energy loss @xmath126 through @xmath33 @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 , @xmath129 , and the @xmath33 particles are assumed to be lighter than the plasmon mass in the supernova core .",
    "typical values for the density and temperature are @xmath130 and @xmath131 @xcite . solving this equation for @xmath115 and inserting into eq.([alphatilde ] ) we then find : @xmath132 in figure  [ fig4 ] we show that this constraint together with those from bbn and the cmb spectrum effectively rules out the model ( taking @xmath133 , and @xmath134 ) .",
    "the only allowed region is a tiny corner at the highest value of @xmath96 and the lowest value of @xmath97 , fixing the recoupling temperature to be 78  kev .",
    "this region is further limited by decreasing @xmath135 or @xmath59 .",
    "of course the physical parameters of supernova collapse are somewhat uncertain so this argument is not definitive .",
    "one can only conclude that @xmath33 particles , if they exist , may play an essential role in the supernova process @xcite .",
    "finally we consider the formation of large scale structure and the concomitant generation of small scale cmb anisotropy in a critical density baryonic universe .",
    "particles of the shadow sector can be a candidate for the dark matter . since @xmath136 at recoupling",
    ", there will be a large contribution to the density parameter ( @xmath137 ) unless the @xmath33 particles subsequently self - annihilate efficiently after becoming non - relativistic .",
    "this is however quite possible and , in fact , very likely in analogy to the ` visible ' sector . ] in the standard picture , such structure grows by gravitational instability from a ( nearly ) scale - invariant spectrum of primordial adiabatic , gaussian fluctuations ( with power spectrum @xmath138 , @xmath139 ) , presumably generated during an inflationary phase in the early universe @xcite . on scales smaller than the horizon size at matter - radiation equality",
    "the primordial spectrum is modified and its slope becomes negative .",
    "the cobe detection of anisotropy in the cmb on angular scales exceeding the horizon size at the recombination epoch @xcite has provided strong support for this basic picture and moreover fixed the normalization of the primordial spectrum .",
    "subsequent observations of anisotropy on small angular scales have also provided evidence for a ` doppler peak ' in the angular power spectrum such as would be expected from acoustic oscillations of the coupled plasma and photon fluids during the last scattering of the cmb @xcite .",
    "besides the observed power spectrum of galaxy clustering , we thus have a new quantitative test for models of structure formation .",
    "a baryonic universe was of course the first to be investigated in the context of structure formation @xcite .",
    "the salient feature of such a universe is that fluctuations can begin to grow only after ( re)combination ( rather than as soon as the universe becomes matter - dominated ) since the baryons are tightly coupled to the photons before this epoch .",
    "moreover the coupling is not perfect ( and becomes weaker as the universe turns neutral ) so adiabatic fluctuations suffer ` silk damping ' on scales smaller than the damping mass of @xmath140 .",
    "it was recognized early on that primordial gaussian fluctuations with spectral index @xmath141 would thus result in excessively large fluctuations in the mass distribution on small scales @xcite .",
    "moreover the upper bounds on cmb anisotropy available a decade ago already implied that there would not be sufficient time after ( re)combination for the implied small primordial fluctuations to grow to the large - scale structure observed today in a baryonic universe @xcite .",
    "in the past particle physicists have tended to ignore such constraints since there did not exist a ` standard model ' for the formation of structure .",
    "the increasing weight of observational evidence for the picture outlined above , however , now makes such a viewpoint untenable .",
    "in particular the data ( as opposed to upper limits ) on cmb anisotropy now allow a precise quantitative test of a baryon - dominated universe . for a @xmath142 universe ,",
    "the slope of the primordial spectrum @xmath143 and the hubble parameter @xmath144 are the only free parameters . thus we will first determine the values of @xmath143 and @xmath144 which would allow a fit to the data on small - scale cmb anisotropy .",
    "these are available as measurements of the multipole moments @xmath145 , expanding the cmb temperature on the celestial sphere in spherical harmonics : @xmath146 then we can check if the power spectrum of galaxy clustering can be reproduced for the _ same _ choice of parameters .",
    "we emphasize that this test is thus as model - independent as possible .",
    "to compute the angular power spectrum for each model specified by a pair @xmath147 , we use a fast boltzmann code @xcite and adopt the cobe - normalization at large angular scales .",
    "then we convolve each power spectrum with the experimental ` window functions ' before comparison with the observational data by generating a @xmath148 surface over the @xmath147 space under investigation ; this method is outlined in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath148 value is computed according to @xmath149 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where the sum is over all the cmb observations , @xmath150 and @xmath151 are , respectively , the flat band powers ( i.e. convolved with the experiment - specific ` window functions ' ) for the models and observations , and @xmath152 are the associated observational errors .",
    "the cmb data we consider and the corresponding errors are tabulated in @xcite and shown in figure  [ fig5 ] .",
    "( we consider only the central value of the saskatoon data which have a @xmath153 calibration uncertainty . )",
    "the band powers are given by @xmath154^{1/2},\\ ] ] where the deconvolving factors @xmath155 are the logarithmic integrals of the experimental window functions @xmath156 defined as @xmath157 and @xmath158 can be safely taken to be 1200 for all existing data ( for larger @xmath159 the acceptance is negligible ) .",
    "finally , the angular scale investigated by experiment @xmath160 is given according to @xmath161 to obtain a @xmath148 value for each point of the @xmath147 space we use the data and eq.([deltatmod ] ) for each observation @xmath160 and sum over all existing observations .",
    "the values of the multipoles @xmath162 are obtained by running the fast boltzmann code mentioned above .",
    "@xcite . note also that the error bars @xmath152 are mostly asymmetric ; to accommodate this in the @xmath148 calculation , we establish for each data point whether the model lies above or below and then take the appropriate error bar in eq.([deltatmod ] ) . ]    in figure  [ fig6 ] we show the region of @xmath147 space which is consistent with the data .",
    "we investigate the parameter range @xmath163 and @xmath164 , the former covering _ all _ direct measurements @xcite and the latter based on general theoretical considerations of inflationary models @xcite .",
    "we show both the @xmath165 c.l . and @xmath166 c.l .",
    "contours ; the latter delineate the range @xmath167 the negative correlation of @xmath143 and @xmath144 arises because the amplitude of the acoustic peak plays the dominant role in the fitting procedure and for @xmath142 this peak amplitude decreases as @xmath144 and @xmath143 decrease . thus a decrease in @xmath143 accompanied by a correlated increase in @xmath144 ( or vice versa ) can preserve the amplitude and thus the @xmath148 value for the fit .",
    "in general rather low values of both @xmath143 and @xmath144 are required to fit the acoustic peak in a critical density baryonic universe .    given these favoured values of @xmath143 and @xmath144 we can now calculate the linear matter power spectrum . in figure  [ fig7 ]",
    "we show the spectra for the two extreme models in the @xmath147 plane , viz .",
    "@xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath170 , @xmath171 , along with the data points inferred from the apm galaxy survey @xcite . to compute these spectra",
    "we have used the cosmics code @xcite and normalized to cobe using the prescription given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the strong oscillations seen at short scales arise from matter fluctuations on wavelengths smaller than the hubble radius at ( re)combination and reflect the value of the phase of the perturbation at recombination @xcite .",
    "it is seen that even for extreme choices of parameters , the power spectra of @xmath142 models disagree strongly with the observational data .",
    "even though the clustering of apm galaxies may be enhanced over that of the matter distribution , the discrepancy can not be resolved for any sensible value of the ` bias ' parameter .",
    "the situation is further aggravated if the value of @xmath144 is decreased in figure  [ fig7](a ) or the value of @xmath143 is decreased in figure  [ fig7](b ) , staying within the allowed region of eq.([nhreslts ] ) , since in both cases the matter power spectrum is further damped at short scales .",
    "thus we can firmly establish that it is not possible to simultaneously satisfy the lss and cmb data in an universe with the critical density in baryons .",
    "although big bang nucleosynthesis is usually cited as providing the main argument for non - baryonic dark matter , it is possible to entertain deviations from the standard picture in order to accommodate a baryon - dominated critical density universe .",
    "one such suggestion invoking a _ reduction _ in the comoving entropy after nucleosynthesis @xcite is particularly interesting because it challenges the standard assumption that the thermodynamic history of the universe is well known at least up until the bbn epoch .",
    "we have demonstrated that this model is very tightly constrained ( if not ruled out altogether ) from consideration of other processes such as thermalization of the cmb spectrum and the effects on stellar evolution of the new physics invoked by the model .",
    "finally we have shown that recent observations of small - scale cmb anisotropy and large - scale structure decisively rule out this model .",
