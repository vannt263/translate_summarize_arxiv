    "many low - dimensional spin systems , especially in one dimension , respond discontinuously to the variations of an external magnetic field @xcite . in such systems , magnetization curve forms plateaus as a function of the field . in most cases ,",
    "plateaus are continuously connected to one another , whereas a more interesting scenario is when there are abrupt jumps between two plateaus .",
    "this usually happens at high fields in systems with localized magnon excitations@xcite .",
    "there is a class of models for which magnetization plateaus of the second type are formed via a simple mechanism .",
    "the basic feature of these models is that they consist of units of spins coupled together such that the total spin of each unit is conserved @xcite .",
    "the first of its kind was introduced and studied at zero field by gelfand @xcite .",
    "the system consists of coupled dimers with the following hamiltonian ( see fig .",
    "[ gelf - ladder ] ) , @xmath4    [ l , b][l , b]@xmath5 [ l , b][l , b]@xmath6 [ c , b][c , b]@xmath7 [ c , b][c , b]@xmath8    note that the total spin on each dimer @xmath9 is conserved .",
    "a whole lot of eigenstates can be trivially constructed for the above hamiltonian .",
    "any state in which each dimer has a specific total spin and is maximally polarized in the @xmath10-direction will be an eigenstate . then , one expects the ground state to be a product of dimer - singlets for @xmath11 . a lower bound on @xmath6 such that the dimer - singlet is the ground state has been obtained by rewriting the hamiltonian as sum of units consisting of three spins @xcite , and is given by , @xmath12 for @xmath13 , the ground state in fact remains to be the dimer - singlet for @xmath14 . for @xmath15 ,",
    "all the dimers go into triplets and form the ground state of a spin-@xmath3 uniform chain .",
    "the lower - bound for @xmath6 given in suggests that , the higher the spin , the stronger the dimer bond needs to be for the dimer - singlet to be the ground state .",
    "but it turns out that the dimer - singlet is quite robust even for very large spins . in this paper",
    ", we show that the lower bound on @xmath16 can be pushed down to @xmath17 for arbitrary values of spin , _",
    "i.e. _ , the bound given by ( [ lower - bound ] ) for @xmath13 is in fact true for all values of @xmath2 .",
    "honecker , mila and troyer@xcite ( from hereon referred to as hmt ) have numerically studied the @xmath18 system in the presence of magnetic field . for @xmath19 ,",
    "the system starts with the dimer - singlet ground state at zero field and the magnetization per site ( @xmath20 ) is zero .",
    "the system remains in the dimer - singlet phase till a transition field @xmath21 , at which one set of alternate dimers form triplets polarized in the direction of the magnetic field ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "for further increase in the field strength , this state remains to be the ground state till a second transition field @xmath23 , at which the rest of the dimers also become triplets and the system is fully polarized ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this behaviour has also been inferred on the basis of a strong coupling analysis @xcite . for @xmath25 ,",
    "gapless phases come into play and the magnetization curve starts developing tails between plateaus before the latter disappear altogether .",
    "hmt also studied a three - leg ladder and obtained abrupt jumps between plateaus in some range of the parameter .",
    "similar results for @xmath13 have been obtained for a modified shastry - sutherland model in two dimensions@xcite and a three - dimensional version of gelfand ladder@xcite .    in this paper , we define a general model in arbitrary dimensions which includes all the models mentioned above . in a certain regime of the parameter space , we obtain the exact ground state(s ) in presence of magnetic field for arbitrary values of spin . the magnetization curve forms plateaus and they jump abruptly from one to another at certain special values of the field .",
    "the magnetization on the plateaus are some rational fractions of the full magnetization , which depend on the underlying spin and the lattice .    outside the exact regime , we argue that the plateaus will survive in the immediate neighbourhood , quite possibly developing tails between successive ones .",
    "but the mechanism for plateau formation in this case is different from the exact regime and this results in first order phase transitions along some of the plateaus .",
    "we rigorously show the existence of such transitions for some special cases . finally , we numerically analyse the ladder defined in for @xmath26 using exact diagonalization .",
    "we obtain the complete phase diagram which confirms our analytic results .",
    "hmt have defined a general @xmath27-leg ladder in one dimension . we generalize further and formally define hamiltonians on an arbitrary bipartite lattice in @xmath1 dimensions , where a bunch of @xmath27 spins live on each lattice - site and interact among each other as well as with the spins living on neighbouring sites .",
    "the reason for writing down the most general hamiltonian is that , most of our analysis is independent of details like dimension , lattice and spin .",
    "let @xmath28 ( ) be the spins living at the site @xmath29 .",
    "define , @xmath30 then the hamiltonian is defined as , @xmath31 where @xmath32 denote nearest neighbours .",
    "we take both the couplings to be positive .",
    "the models mentioned previously are particular cases of the above hamiltonian . for the gelfand ladder and the three - leg ladder in hmt ,",
    "the underlying lattice is a simple chain and @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively . both for the modified shastry - sutherland model@xcite and the 3-@xmath35 model of sutherland@xcite @xmath33 . for the former",
    "the underlying lattice is square and for the latter it is one - fourth depleted cubic .    the variables @xmath36 s are also @xmath37 generators , and they can take the representations having the casimir , such that , when @xmath38 is an integer ; and , when @xmath38 is a half - odd integer .",
    "thus the bunch of spins at each site kinematically act respectively like a bosonic or fermionic rotor , except that the values @xmath39 can take are truncated at @xmath38 .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq . , feels the value of the underlying spin only through this truncation .",
    "this suggests that one can treat the problem for general values of spin .",
    "now we will use a method of _ divide - and - conquer _ to solve for the ground state . if one can write @xmath40 as a sum over smaller units @xmath41 , such that there exists a state @xmath42 which is simultaneously a ground state of each and every @xmath41",

    ", this means that we can put together these states living on the bonds and construct a state which will be a simultaneous ground state of @xmath41 for every @xmath44 .",

    "these plateau transitions are similar to the macroscopic magnetization jumps discussed by schulenburg _ et .",
    "the difference being that , in our case the localization of magnons arises from conservation laws .",
    "the above solution for the ground state hinges on one crucial aspect - the ground state of the bond hamiltonian ( @xmath51 ) is a product state on the two sites . for half - odd integer @xmath38 and @xmath66",
    ", we have seen that the ground state of @xmath51 has @xmath83 .",
    "this is not a product state and thus can not necessarily be satisfied for all bonds .",

    "this is gapless , even in one - dimension@xcite , and therefore the magnetization will vary continuously with the field . for @xmath84 , the solution again has @xmath83 .",
    "this is the fully polarized state of the spin-@xmath0 system .",
    "the field at which it becomes fully polarized can be determined by the gap of one - magnon states ( _ i.e. _ , all spins except one pointing up ) . for a hyper - cubic lattice in @xmath1 dimensions ,",

    "i.e. _ the transition field at which @xmath39 goes up to @xmath87 . also let @xmath39 be even ( a similar argument holds for odd @xmath39 as well ) .",

    "they make an exception for those special values of the field at which there is a jump in magnetization .",
    "the above analysis shows that even at transition fields the ground states belong to the afore - mentioned set .",
    "the _ divide - and - conquer _ method we employed in the previous section to find the exact ground state worked because the ground state of the bond hamiltonian ( @xmath51 ) is a product state .",
    "this is no longer true for @xmath89 .",

    "now we will argue that the product states , and hence the magnetization plateaus , do indeed survive for a while as @xmath6 goes below @xmath92 .",
    "significantly , the solutions are not same as that for @xmath62 as given by eqs . and .",
    "the new solutions also form plateaus at the same fractions and it results in a first order phase transition on each plateau ( with certain exceptions ) at @xmath93 .    for the proof of the existence of product state solutions for @xmath94 , we do the following .",
    "first we will show that , at @xmath95 , the only solutions are a finite number of product states , except at the transition fields .",

    "becomes , @xmath97 the above hamiltonian sees only the total spin of the bond , but is independent of the spins of the sites .",

    "there is a greater degree of degeneracy",
    ". then the constraint on the ground state is more relaxed - the total spin on a bond can be @xmath39 or @xmath87 .",
    "this gives rise to a degeneracy which is local and hence grows exponentially with the system size .",
    "away from the transitions fields , the ground states are those given by eq . and are not related to each other by any local transformation .",
    "it is then fair to assume that there is a gap to excitations .",

    "the energy spectrum will depend linearly on all the three parameters and all transitions of the ground state are via level crossings .",
    "( the transitions will be first order unless there is a continuum of level crossings - a possibility in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "a gap to the ground states at @xmath118 would then imply that there exists some non - zero positive number @xmath96 , such that for the ground state(s ) will be among those at @xmath118 . among the states in eq .",
    ", the one with the lowest energy for @xmath89 is given by , @xmath119 these states also have the same fractions for magnetization as before .",
    "but , now the system prefers to put all the spin into sites in one sub - lattice , if that is possible .",
    "this is in contrast to the situation for @xmath62 where it is energetically favourable to distribute the spin equally among the two sub - lattices . at @xmath120 ,",
    "one sub - lattice will be saturated and then the other sub - lattice start getting excited to higher and higher spins .    in the above states , when @xmath121 ,",
    "sites in one sub - lattice have spin @xmath122 and those in the other sub - lattice have spin @xmath123 . on the plateau ,",
    "each spin is maximally polarized in the @xmath10-direction . below a critical field",
    ", gapless phase of the same set of spins will have lower energy .",
    "the critical field , in units of @xmath5 , will be the gap in the spectrum of one - magnons ( states with all spins but one maximally polarized , the odd one having @xmath10-component one less than maximum ) . for a hyper - cubic lattice in @xmath1-dimensions consisting of spins @xmath59 in one sub - lattice and @xmath60 in the other ,",
    "the critical field is given by , @xmath124 hmt have numerically found such lines of transition for @xmath13 , two and three legged ladders and the formula above is consistent with their results .",

    "the product state solutions we obtain exhibit magnetization plateaus",
    ". then we argued that there exist product state solutions and hence magnetization plateaus even as @xmath6 goes below @xmath92 , but the mechanism for plateau formation is different from the case @xmath126 .",
    "thus , on a plateau , there are _ first order phase transitions at @xmath118_.    hmt have obtained a similar first order phase transition on the plateau for the three - leg , @xmath13 model . in their case",

    "<S> we generalize a class of heisenberg antiferromagnets in one , two and three dimensions , which have been shown to exhibit magnetization plateaus for spin-@xmath0 . in a certain parameter range of the general model , which is formally defined in @xmath1 dimensions , we obtain the exact ground state(s ) in the presence of an external magnetic field for arbitrary values of spin . in this range , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization remains a constant as a function of the external field , except at some special values of the field where there is a jump from one plateau to the next . </S>",
    "<S> the plateaus are formed at certain specific fractions of the full magnetization which are determined by the spin and the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> our general spin-@xmath2 result reproduces the known cases for spin-@xmath0 in various lattices . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we argue that outside the exact regime , the mechanism for the plateau formation is different . </S>",
    "<S> this results in first order phase transitions along some of the plateaus as the coupling constant is varied . </S>",
    "<S> we rigorously show the existence of such transitions for some particular cases . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we numerically analyze a spin-@xmath3 model in one dimension using exact diagonalization to obtain its complete phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> it agrees with our analytic results . </S>"
