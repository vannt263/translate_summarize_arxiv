    "an element of @xmath8 is shown on figure 1 .",
    "elements of @xmath6 have a number of different interpretations , see e.g. section 1 below .",
    "in particular , they can be viewed as plane partitions or stepped surfaces inside a three - dimensional box of size @xmath9 .",
    "a uniformly distributed element of @xmath6 then provides a basic model of a _",
    "random surface_. this model and its generalizations have been thoroughly studied , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "tiling , stepped surface or boxed plane partition . separating lines between horizontal lozenges",
    "are removed .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to introduce and study certain discrete time markov chains on boxed plane partitions that preserve the uniform measures .",
    "denote by @xmath10 the uniform probability measure on @xmath6 .",
    "we construct two families of stochastic matrices @xmath11 , \\\\",

    "although it is a little awkward to write matrices @xmath15 in one formula , application of markov operators corresponding to these matrices is fairly easy to describe algorithmically",
    ". the exact algorithm can be found in section [ section_algorithm ] .",
    "roughly speaking , the algorithm does the following : given @xmath16 , in order to construct @xmath17 distributed according to @xmath18 it needs to consider all horizontal lozenges of @xmath19 sequentially from left to right . for each such lozenge",
    "the algorithm decides on its new position using a simple one - dimensional probability distribution .",
    "( here we ignored occasional appearance / diappearance of horizontal lozenges on top and at the bottom , that sometimes take place . ) in a way , this means that @xmath15 decompose into products of one - dimensional markov steps .",
    "the algorithm has some similarity to the shuffling algorithm for domino tilings of the aztec diamonds introduced in @xcite .",
    "indeed , that algorithm also maps uniform measures to uniform measures ( actually , it works for a one - dimensional family of measures that includes the uniform one ) , and it also decomposes into simple ( bernoulli ) markov steps . for that reason we call our algorithm the _ shuffling algorithm for boxed plane partitions_.    we further consider markov chains obtained by successive application of arbitrary sequences of matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the initial condition and the one - time distributions are all uniform measures on the appropriate spaces @xmath14 .",
    "one example is the application of the sequence of @xmath22 matrices @xmath20 to the unique probability measure on singleton @xmath23 .",
    "this gives a perfect sampling algorithm for @xmath10 that takes @xmath24 one - dimensional steps .",
    "when @xmath25 , @xmath22 , and @xmath26 are comparable , the algorithm is roughly as efficient as that from @xcite , and it is more efficient than other known algorithms , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "another example is an alternating sequence @xmath27 that provides an equilibrium dynamics on @xmath6 with @xmath10 as the equilibrium measure .",
    "these markov chains can be viewed as two - dimensional random growth / decay models .",
    "one important feature of these models is the fact that on certain two - dimensional sections of the three - dimensional space - time , their suitably defined correlation functions are computable in a closed determinantal form .",
    "for the static correlation functions ( those of the measures @xmath28 ) this fact is well known , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we then focus on the _ bulk asymptotics _ of the correlation functions .",
    "namely , when @xmath29 with @xmath30 fixed , we look at the three - dimensional lattice process near a fixed point of the global limit shape of our random surface . on the same two - dimensional sections we compute the limiting correlation functions that also have the determinantal form . in fact , for every such section , they define a two - dimensional determinantal random point process with a certain gibbs property , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "our results extend similar results for the static case obtained in @xcite .",
    "the construction of @xmath15 is an application of the general algebraic formalism developed in @xcite .",
    "the continuous time markov chain considered in @xcite in detail can be viewed as the degeneration of @xmath15 near a corner of the hexagon as @xmath13 become large , and either @xmath25 and @xmath22 is substantially larger than the other two .",
    "it is worth noting that the shuffling algorithm for domino tilings of the aztec diamonds also fits into the formalism of @xcite , see section 2.6 of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the proof of the bulk asymptotics involves spectral decomposition of the matrices @xmath15 in terms of hahn classical orthogonal polynomials .",
    "however , the limiting argument does not require the asymptotics of hahn polynomials themselves  it only requires the much simpler asymptotics of the difference operators related to hahn polynomials .",
    "this approach to bulk asymptotics of determinantal point processes is due to g.  olshanski ; it was first used in @xcite for charlier and krawtchouk orthogonal polynomials , and in @xcite it was further developed in the more complex case of hahn polynomials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 1",
    "we discuss different combinatorial definitions of our model and introduce notations . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce four stochastic matrices on one - dimensional point configurations and prove certain commutativity relations between them . in section 3",
    ", we use these four matrices to define @xmath15 ; the construction is based on an idea from @xcite .",
    "section 4 contains the algorithmic description of @xmath15 and images obtained from their computer realizations . in section 5",
    "we compute the correlation functions on suitable two - dimensional sections of the space - time , and in section 6 we obtain the bulk limits .",
