    "spin dynamics of a strongly spin - polarized normal fermi liquid still captures appreciable theoretical and experimental interest . among the main questions here",
    "is whether the transverse ( i.e. in a direction perpendicular to the external field ) magnetization excitations are damped at zero temperature .    polarizing a fermi liquid creates a gap @xmath0 between the two fermi energies for spins up and down . here",
    "@xmath1 is the gyromagnetic ratio of @xmath2he nuclei , @xmath3 is the susceptibility of the liquid .",
    "meyerovich has pointed out @xcite that the existence of the gap leads to a non - conventional temperature dependence of the transverse relaxation time , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is of the order of the gap , and therefore to a damping of the transverse excitations even at zero temperature .",
    "this idea has been pursued in several theoretical papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and was contested recently by fomin @xcite , who argued that the conclusion of existence of zero - temperature attenuation is drawn from the wrong premises about the ground state of a polarized fermi - liquid , viz .",
    ", from treating the quasiparticles between two fermi levels as excitations .",
    "whereas as long as the polarization of the liquid is conserved , these particles should be considered as an inalienable part of the ground state .",
    "curiously , a similar discussion arose in mesoscopic physics where a poorly argued concept of finite dephasing time at @xmath6 has been developed @xcite and contested @xcite , @xcite .    the results of the measurements of the spin diffusion coefficients by spin echo experiments in pure @xmath2he @xcite , @xcite and in solutions of @xmath2he in @xmath7he @xcite , @xcite with a spin polarization of a few percent revealed a finite value of @xmath5 in a qualitative agreement with the zero - attenuation concept .",
    "but the observed @xmath5 were several times greater than theoretical estimations in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the contrary , the recent measurements of linear spin wave damping in dilute @xmath2he at even higher polarizations @xcite are in agreement with fomin s theory ( @xmath8 ) , although the upper limit for a finite @xmath5 set by this experiment ( due to the error bars ) does not allow to rule out completely the existing theory of zero temperature spin wave damping .",
    "a coherent theory of strongly polarized fermi liquids based on a properly defined ground state is lacking . on the other hand",
    "a proper interpretation of the experimental data for a strongly polarized liquid is itself non - trivial .",
    "the point is that the magnetic field acting on the spins of a liquid is conventionally supposed to equal the external field @xmath9 . in reality",
    "the field inside a specimen is well - known to differ from @xmath9 due to the shape - dependent demagnetizing field proportional to the magnetization .",
    "an oscillating magnetization thus acts back on itself via the demagnetizing ( or dipolar ) field .",
    "this phenomenon manifests itself as magnetostatic waves in ferrimagnets theoretically described by kittel @xcite and walker @xcite .",
    "walker originally showed that if the magnetization @xmath10 is supposed to obey the larmor precession around the internal magnetic field * @xmath11 @xmath12 * then because @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related through maxwell equations they can self - consistently oscillate only with certain frequencies localized in the range @xmath13 near the larmor frequency .",
    "in an interacting fermi liquid ( [ precession ] ) should be replaced with the leggett system of equations . in the linear approximation ,",
    "solutions of this system are standing spin wave modes with the widths proportional to the transverse relaxation time .",
    "so study of the behavior of the widths of the modes with temperature is one of the possible ways to detect the zero - temperature transverse attenuation .    for _ weakly - polarized _ liquids the effects of the demagnetizing field can be discarded .",
    "but it is preferable to have _",
    "strong polarizations _ in order to increase the predicted temperatures of the attenuation onset .",
    "so the effect of polarization has to be taken into consideration for the proper interpretation of the spectra .",
    "on the other hand at sufficiently strong polarizations one can expect considerable changes in the leggett description of the fermi liquid spin dynamics .",
    "in particular , due to the presence of two fermi surfaces a double set of the fermi - liquid parameters must enter the theory .",
    "we will use leggett equations assuming that they are still valid when the share of polarized nuclei of the liquid does not surpass @xmath1410 % .    to include dipolar field",
    "we have chosen to write out the dipolar part of the internal field @xmath11 explicitly as an integral of the magnetization , this integral being a general solution of maxwell differential equations with maxwell boundary conditions .",
    "thus we work with a closed integro - differential equation directly on the magnetization .",
    "a short review of other possible methods is done in the discussions section .",
    "we start directly from the generalized leggett equations and study the effects of the demagnetizing field coherently .",
    "we specialize to the case of linear spin waves , setting spin echo experiments aside .",
    "a full - blown study including numerical calculations is done only for a spherical shape . for a finite cylinder as well as for a sphere we also calculated the changes to the spectra by the demagnetizing field using perturbation theory .",
    "our results show that the demagnetizing field introduces small corrections ( about 4% ) to the value of low temperature transversal relaxation rate experimentally determined by g.vermeulen and a.roni @xcite .",
    "hence , the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite about the absence of zero - temperature spin wave damping is supported .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sections ii and iii form the basis needed to comprehend the authors point of view . in sec .",
    "ii we show how to include the dipolar field in the standard leggett equations and to how to linearize the result to obtain an equation for spin waves subject to both exchange and demagnetizing fields .    in sec .",
    "iii as the simplest application of the theory developed we find corrections to the spin wave spectra in a finite cylinder in the first order of perturbation theory . at the end of the sec .",
    "iii we find dipolar limitations on the correct determination of the transverse relaxation time from the conventional interpretation of the spectra .",
    "the next section iv contains similar first order perturbational estimation of the dipolar - field corrections to the spin waves spectra in a spherical container .",
    "the results for a sphere are compared to numerical simulations carried out in section v , where we also calculate spin wave spectra in the regimes of intermediate and strong demagnetizing fields .    in the last section",
    "vi we discuss conclusions .",

    "magnetostatic spectra are in no way specific to the fermi liquid and so contain no information on its parameters .    for intermediate polarizations",

    "when the spin wave spectra are used for measuring the transverse relaxation time @xmath241 , a proper treatment of experimental data taking into account dipolar field corrections is necessary .",
    "we estimated that the dipolar restrictions on the correct determination of @xmath241 from the conventional interpretation of the spectra are of the order of the parameter ( [ parameter ] ) or ( [ paramater - sph ] ) .",

    "a major inference for planning future experiments is the proposal to use ellipsoidal , in particular , spherical containers , not only because the estimation of the shape - dependent dipolar field effects is simpler , but also because there are two roughly equal contributions to the spin wave spectrum distortion ,  one from the inhomogeneity of the static demagnetizing field and the other from the demagnetizing field produced by the rotating part of the magnetization .",
    "the first contribution exists only in non - ellipsoidal samples , in which a homogeneous static magnetization produces inhomogeneous demagnetizing field . for this reason implementation of such shapes for the experiments on the elicitation of the liquids characteristics from the spectra",
