    "of said films , the depth dependence of the transmission per unit area is remarkably uniform for a given structure set and transport direction . a maximum value of transmission per unit area of 50 - 80% that of bulk copper is reached for depths greater than 0.35 - 0.5 nm , depending on surface environment and transport direction , in all studied structures thicker than 2 nm , remaining approximately constant all the way through to the center [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : slab - depth ] ] .",
    "however , these plateau values remain below the full transmission per unit area of bulk copper despite their apparent convergence at the center of the films , an effect brought on by the presence of surface scattering and its limiting of the number of conduction paths for electrons to propagate along the film .",
    "while the center of the films exhibit an atomic structure similar to that of bulk cu , and hence one may expect the local number of conducting paths to be the same , the close proximity of surfaces imposes restrictions over the number of independent paths in the films , even at the center .",
    "the reason behind these differences might be found in the electronic structure of bulk copper : although it exhibits an isotropic conductivity , inspection of the state distribution across its brillouin zone ( bz ) reveals that not all directions are equivalent in terms of states which propagate along them at the fermi level : whilst states can be found along @xmath35 and @xmath36 paths associated with @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 $ ] directions , respectively , there are no states along the @xmath39 path associated with direction @xmath40$] ; a feature made evident by the shape of the fermi surface and its vanishing dos along directions perpendicular to the hexagonal faces of the bz@xcite .",

    "[ fig : structure](b ) . ]      the previous analysis of the transmission pathways results suggests that the total transmission in all but the thinnest films of each structure set can be decomposed as a sum of two contributions : a _ surface _ contribution describing transmission for depths less than 0.35 - 0.5 nm into the films and a _ plateau _ contribution describing transport for greater depths . in terms of transmissions per unit area ( @xmath41 )",
    ", we may write :    @xmath42    where we have split the cross - sectional area of the film into the area of the surface and plateau regions , and each term on the rhs is proportional to the maximum current that can flow through the corresponding section of the film . since the depth up to which transmission is strongly suppressed by the surface does not vary with thickness , we shall consider @xmath43 to be constant for all structures  except the thinnest films  within each set .",

    "it is seen that whilst the surface environment for electrons propagating along the b axis  in which the missing rows of cu atoms are parallel to the transport direction  is more resistive , it has less of an impact on the resistance of the plateau region than for electrons travelling along the a axis .",
    "this correlates to the fact that total film transmission per unit area increases at a higher rate for transport along the b axis as thickness increases , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tran - area ] . in the case of these two transport directions , we have included results obtained with dft as an assessment of the error introduced by the use of dftb on the values of fitted parameters : whilst differences on @xmath44 can be as high as 40% , qualitative trends hold and errors on @xmath45 remain within the expected 10% .",
    "results for transport along the [ 100 ] crystallographic direction for the second set of structures show its corresponding surface environment s resistance to be similar to that of transport along ( 100)-[100 ] a , although it results in a higher resistance at the plateau region , a feature evident in the fact that its transmission per unit area increases less than for structures in the first set in the 3 - 5 nm thickness range [ see fig .

    "transmission along [ 100 ] is shown to always take place at an angle with respect to the transport direction ; while transport along [ 110 ] is shown to have a sizeable parallel component .",
    "this is shown by the fact that the largest transmission pathways ( bubbles ) along [ 100 ] are found halfway between cu atoms ( * + * ) , whilst the largest bubbles are found to lay directly on top of cu atoms for transport occurring along [ 110 ] .",
    "forward transmission is found to be severely suppressed when approaching both surfaces , with an associated increase in backscattering coefficients .",

    "this enables the calculation of transport properties of structures with a larger number of atoms and hence more realistic models of nanoscale interconnects .",
    "it is found that oxidation of the surface of copper thin films results in a dramatic reduction of electron transmission directly at the interface , an effect which severely degrades local electron transmission coefficients for distances of up to approximately 0.35 - 0.5 nm into the films , depending on the crystallographic orientation of exposed surface facets  a result which highlights the importance and provides a scale length for interface effects in nanoscale copper systems  although introducing the effects of inelastic scattering and other decoherence effects might modify surface effects depth of influence discussed in this work .",
    "maximising conductance in nanoscale copper interconnects requires careful interface design between conductor and barrier layer as the chemical environment at the surface and orientation along which transport occurs can have critical impact for cu systems with feature lengths below 10 nm .",
    "tensile strain tends to be detrimental to film conductance as the transmission per unit area is found to be reduced for films under biaxial tensile strain studied in this work . for film thicknesses of @xmath32 3 nm and greater , a core region for which transmission is somewhat independent of depth is formed , although bulk - like transmission has not been observed even at the center of films as thick as 5.6 nm .",
    "the use of a localised transmission model shows the resistance of the studied films to dramatically increase near the surface ; whereas the increase in resistance at the core region is found to strongly depend on the surface environment and transport direction .",

    "<S> electron transport is studied in surface oxidised single - crystal copper thin films with a thickness of up to 5.6 nm by applying density functional theory and density functional tight binding methods to determine electron transport properties within the ballistic regime . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the electron transmission as a function of film thickness as well as the different contributions to the overall electron transmission as a function of depth into the the films is examined . </S>",
    "<S> transmission at the oxidised copper film surfaces is found to be universally low . </S>",
    "<S> films with thickness greater than 2.7 nm exhibit a similar behaviour in local transmission per unit area with depth from the film surface ; transmission per unit area initially increases rapidly and then plateaus at a depth of approximately 0.35 - 0.5 nm away from the surface , dependent on surface facet . </S>",
    "<S> unstrained films tend to exhibit a higher transmission per unit area than corresponding films under tensile strain . </S>"
