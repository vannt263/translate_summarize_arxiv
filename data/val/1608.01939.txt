    "billions of personal devices , ranging from in - car gps to mobile phones and fitness bracelets , connect us to the cloud .",
    "these ubiquitous interconnections of the physical and the digital world are opening up a host of new opportunities for predictive mobility models .",
    "each user of these devices produces rich information that can help us to capture their daily mobility routine .",
    "this core knowledge , when obtained from massive number of individuals , impacts a wide range of areas such as health monitoring  @xcite , ubiquitous computing  @xcite , disaster response  @xcite or smart traffic management  @xcite .    in the age of ubiquitous computing ,",
    "recent contributions to mobility modeling have flourished in computer science  @xcite , transportation engineering  @xcite , geographic information sciences  @xcite , and complexity sciences  @xcite .",
    "while these findings have enhanced our level of understanding of mobility modeling we need further work to tackle the problem of individual predictability .",
    "human mobility has been studied using a multitude of proxies ( for example call detail records ( cdr ) , gps , wifi , travel surveys ) , and a variety of techniques have been suggested for predictive models , such as markov chains , naive bayes , artificial neural networks , time series analysis .",
    "studies report varying results for the predictive power of these models , with accuracy as high as 93% and as low as under 40% . in this paper we set out to uncover the reasons behind these differences in performance by a thorough investigation of the factors that may influence an estimation of mobility predictability .",
    "the key contributions of this paper are :    1 .   we describe the factors that have influenced the various ranges when estimating predictability .",
    "these include : ( a ) does the analysis concern the upper limit of predictability , or actual next - place prediction ?",
    "( b ) what is the specific formulation of the prediction problem ?",
    "e.g. is the goal to predict the next location , or is the goal to identify location in the next time - bin ?",
    "( c ) what is the spatial resolution ?",
    "e.g. is the analysis based on gps vs. cdr data ?",
    "( d ) what is the temporal resolution e.g. minutes , hours ? 2 .",
    "we quantify the amount of explorations and locations visited only once , and show that these are key limiting factors in the accuracy of predictions for individual mobility .",
    "3 .   we measure the predictive power of a number of contextual features ( e.g. social proximity , time , call / sms ) .",
    "4 .   we study the problem of predictability of human mobility using a novel , longitudinal , high - precision location dataset for more than 400 users .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first provide an overview of related work in the field of human mobility prediction .",
    "next , we introduce the dataset and describe the preprocessing steps . in the subsequent section",
    "we describe the baseline models , and compare their performances .",
    "finally we introduce the exploration prediction problem and report the performance of the predictive models .",
    "in a seminal paper song _",
    "et al_.  @xcite investigate the limits of predictability of human mobility , using call detail records ( cdr ) as proxy for human movement .",
    "in their analysis , the authors discretize location into a sequence of places , and estimate an upper limit for the predictive performance using fano s inequality on the temporal entropy of visits .",
    "their results show that for a majority of users , this upper bound is surprisingly high ( 93% ) .",
    "this framework has been further explored to refine the upper limit . specifically , lin et al .",
    "@xcite study the effects of spatial and temporal resolution on the predictability limit , smith et al .",
    "@xcite consider the spatial reachability constraints when selecting the next place to visit , and obtain a tighter upper bound of 81 - 85% , and lu et al .",
    "@xcite analyze the predictability of the population of haiti after the earthquake in 2010 , and show that the upper limit of predictability remains as high as 85% .    the work described above focuses on the upper limit of predictability based on estimating the entropy of trajectories",
    "when the topic is actual prediction performance , some of the most studied models are markov chains , where the probability of the next location is assumed to depend only on the current location .",
    "markov chains have been applied to a variety of data sets .",
    "lu et al .",
    "@xcite applied markov chain models to cdr - based locations in cote divore , with a prediction goal of estimating the last location of the day at the prefecture ( county ) level . under these conditions",
    "the models perform extremely well , reaching an accuracy of over 90% . in  @xcite",
    "the authors apply the markov models to wifi traces at darthmouth campus and find that the best performing model is order 2 and has a median accuracy of about @xmath0 .",
    "finally , bapierre et al .",
    "@xcite applied a variable - order markov chain to the reality mining  @xcite and geolife  @xcite datasets .",
    "another frequently used category of models is naive bayes , where the probability of next location is factorized as independent probabilities for a number of context variables .",
    "gao et al .",
    "@xcite applied this approach to the nokia data challenge dataset  @xcite using time and location features , and obtained an accuracy of approximately 50% .",
    "do et al .",
    "@xcite applied the same technique but used a larger number of features including also sms , calls and bluetooth proximity , and obtained an accuracy of approximately 60% . in a subsequent paper",
    "@xcite the same authors then explore a kernel density estimation approach for improving performance .",
    "a number of more complex methods have also been explored in the literature , including non - linear time series  @xcite , principal component analysis  @xcite , gaussian mixtures  @xcite and dynamic bayesian networks  @xcite .",
    "while recent work on predictability has resulted in richer methods and incorporated interesting new features such as social contacts , they have not deeply characterized the intrinsic characteristics of human mobility that form the basis for the limitations in predicting the next visited location . in this paper",
    "we focus on that aspect , showing that in @xmath1 weeks , individuals visit on average @xmath2 unique locations , of which @xmath3 of them are visited only once . despite most of the trips being among @xmath4 of their recurrent locations ; the occurrence of an exploration can be predicted with at best @xmath5 of accuracy .",
    "separating the two types of visited locations and improving the ways to predict an exploration would advance the methods in this area .",
    "in this study we analyze a dataset from the copenhagen network study  @xcite .",
    "the project has collected mobile sensing data from smartphones for more than 800 students at the technical university of denmark ( dtu ) .",
    "the data sources include gps location , bluetooth , sms , phone contacts , wifi , and facebook friendships .",
    "data collection was approved by the danish data protection agency , and informed consent has been obtained for all study all participants .    for this study",
    "we focus on the location data , which is collected by the smartphone with frequency of one sample every 15 minutes .",
    "each location sample contains a timestamp , a latitude and longitude , and an accuracy value .",
    "the location is determined by the best available provider , either gps or wifi , with a median accuracy of @xmath6 meters ; more than 90% of the samples are reported to have an accuracy better than @xmath7 meters .",
    "for individual participants , there may be periods missing data .",
    "these periods can occur for various reasons , for example due to a drained battery , the phone being switched off , the location probe being disabled , or due to software issues . since we are interested in reconstructing mobility histories without large gaps , we select the longest period that has at least one sample in 90% of the 15-minutes time - bins for each participant .",
    "moreover we consider only participants that have at least 3 months long period of such contiguous data .",
    "we are left with 454 users , with data collection periods of data ranging from three months to one year .",
    "[ fig : periods_lengths ] shows the distribution of period lengths .",
    "the data is mainly concentrated in denmark where the study takes place , but because students use the phones during travel , the dataset spans several other countries as well .",
    "[ fig : locmap ] shows a map of the locations in the world ( left pane ) and in denmark ( right pane ) .",
    "in this work we are interested in the location prediction task .",
    "this task can be broadly stated as follows : given your location history , how well can we predict your future location ? the specific details of how this question is implemented have a profound impact on the prediction accuracy .",
    "below we investigate how various factors , e.g.  spatial and temporal data resolution play a role in determining the reported accuracy for a single underlying dataset .    because the prediction task can be stated in many different ways , we start the discussion by analyzing different problem formulations . in terms of spatial prediction",
    "it is possible to discretize space in grid cells , voronoi cells or define places using a clustering method . in terms of temporal prediction",
    "we could decide to predict a location in the next time - bin , or within a time horizon , or as the next visited place . in this paper",
    "we select two of the most common problem formulations : _ next - cell _ and _ next - place_. in the _ next - cell _ formulation we discretize space into grid cells , and we predict the cell in the next time - bin . in the _ next - place _ formulation we detect visits to places and we predict the next visited place .",
    "the following sections provide details on the two alternative formulations , and show how each formulation affects the prediction task .",
    "in the first problem formulation , we convert geographical coordinates _",
    "( lon , lat ) _ into discrete symbols by placing a uniform grid on the map and retrieving the grid cell i d associated with the coordinates . specifically , we start by considering a grid of approximate size 50 meters x 50 meters . at each timestep",
    "@xmath8 minutes , we convert the current _ ( lon , lat ) _ into a cell i d , therefore producing a sequence of symbols through which we can represent a user s location history .",
    "[ fig : cell - process ] illustrates the process .        in this formulation",
    ", the problem can be restated as follows : given your past cell sequence up to time @xmath9 , which cell will you visit at time @xmath10 ? before trying to perform any prediction at all , following the process suggested in @xcite , we calculate the theoretical upper limit for the predictability of the cells sequence . fig .",
    "[ fig : predictability ] shows how the maximum predictability for the grid cell formulation is peaked at around 0.95 .",
    "we now consider different baseline strategies for next grid cell prediction .",
    "for each of the strategies , we perform prediction in an online manner , by training the algorithm on the data up to timestep @xmath9 , and predicting cell at timestep @xmath10 .",
    "we measure the accuracy as number of correct predictions over the number of total predictions .",
    "we first consider the _ toploc _ strategy , where at each timestep we predict the most frequent symbol in the history so far .",
    "given the highly stationary nature of most human mobility trajectories , we expect this simple strategy to achieve a relatively high accuracy .",
    "[ fig : timebin - accuracy ] top panel shows the distribution of accuracies for all the users .",
    "the accuracy of the _ toploc _ is indeed reasonable , peaking at around 0.4 .",
    "we now consider the markov chain model . in this model ,",
    "the prediction of next state depends only on the current state .",
    "the transition probabilities between locations are estimated based on past transitions in the location history . for making a prediction",
    ", we then consider the transition that has the highest probability among all possible transitions from the current cell .",
    "if the current state has never been seen before , then we have no information about the transition probability to other states . in this case",
    "we fall back and predict the most frequent state .",
    "again we fit the model in an online manner , updating at each step the transition probabilities and then making a prediction for the next timestep .",
    "[ fig : timebin - accuracy ] middle panel shows the distribution of accuracies for all the users .",
    "the accuracy of the _ markov _ model is much higher than toploc , peaking at around 0.7 .    considering the highly stationary nature of typical trajectories , we hypothesize that a significant part of the markov prediction power in this formulation comes from self - transitions , that is , the model predicting the user to remain in the same state as in the previous time - bin .",
    "to test this hypothesis , we consider the _ stationary _ strategy : at each step we predict that the user will remain in the current cell .",
    "[ fig : timebin - accuracy ] bottom panel shows that the distribution of accuracies for _ stationary _ closely matches the one for _",
    "markov_. furthermore fig .",
    "[ fig : accuracy - correlation ] shows how the two are very strongly correlated ( pearson s @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "this strongly suggests that , in this formulation , most of the markov model power comes from self - transitions , as suspected .",
    "we now investigate another issue related to this problem formulation .",
    "intuitively , we expect that the size of our spatial units will influence the accuracy of prediction . predicting a user s location with the precision of few meters",
    "is intuitively much more difficult that predicting with precision of several kilometers . in order to examine the effect of spatial resolution",
    ", we also consider results for cell size 500 meters and 5000 meters , and apply the _ markov _ model .",
    "[ fig : cell - accuracy - spatial ] compares the accuracy for different spatial resolutions . as expected the accuracy dramatically improves as the spatial size increases .",
    "finally we investigate the effect of temporal resolution within this problem formulation .",
    "our findings above suggest that using a very fine - grained temporal resolution will increase the number of self - transitions , thus driving up the accuracy of the prediction that is mainly able to capture stationarity .",
    "we achieve this by discretizing the location at 50 meters cell size , but varying the temporal time binning to 15 minutes , 30 minutes and 60 minutes , and then running the _ markov _ model for each scenario .",
    "[ fig : cell - accuracy - temporal ] compares the accuracy for different temporal resolutions .",
    "as expected , the accuracy is decreased as the time - bins grow larger due fewer self - transitions .",
    "we now consider an alternative problem formulation . instead of predicting the cell in the next timestep , we want to predict only when we observe a transition between places , eliminating the possiblity of self - transitions . in order to do so ,",
    "we convert the raw gps locations into a sequence of stops at places .",
    "a large amount of literature has been dedicated to the problem of place detection , such as methods based on wifi fingerprint  @xcite , grid clustering  @xcite , and kernel density estimation  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the following process , based on density - based clustering approaches such as @xcite .",
    "each user is treated individually .",
    "we define a `` stop '' as sequence of location - observations where the user has been approximately stationary , that is , the distance between position at time @xmath9 and @xmath10 is less than a threshold @xmath13 meters , roughly corresponding to the gps accuracy .",
    "this produces a sequence of stops , each one with a centroid calculated as the median of the locations coordinates , and a duration equal to the time between the last location and the first location sample . in order to filter out the short stops during commute",
    ", we consider only stops with duration greater than 15 minutes .",
    "the average number of stops per user per day is 2.89 with standard deviation 0.89 .",
    "we are now interested in grouping stops into places , where a `` place '' is a group of spatially related stops representing a self - contained area such as a building . in order to do so",
    ", we apply the dbscan  @xcite clustering to the stops in the geographical coordinate space , using the haversine distance .",
    "we set as parameter the grouping distance @xmath14 meters , and _",
    "min_pts _ = 2 .",
    "this distance threshold is set to produce places of the approximate size of a large building .",
    "the result of the clustering is an assignment of a cluster label to each stop , where the label represents the place that the stop belongs to .",
    "finally , in order avoid artifacts due to missing samples or noise , we merge multiple consecutive stops at the same place into one .",
    "this process converts the raw location history into a sequence of stops at places .",
    "[ fig : stops - extraction ] and [ fig : dbscan ] illustrate the complete process of stop detection .",
    "are examined sequentially , and are grouped into a stop as long as they are within a distance threshold . in the example , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are assigned to the first stop but @xmath17 does not , since it too far away .",
    "subsequently @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are assigned to stop 2 . ]        as example result of this process , let us consider the stops and places extracted for a user .",
    "the sequence of stops at places can be represented as a weekly schedule capturing the user s movement patterns . in fig .",
    "[ fig : schedule ] each row represents a week from monday to sunday ; each place is encoded as a different color . inspecting this visualization it immediately possible to spot the periodic patters characterizing human mobility , such as evening returns to the home location , and morning trips to class .",
    "we can also spot many irregularities however , that deviate from the normal schedule : small stops , new explorations , and day - by - day variability .",
    "finally we can also see a large change in routine starting week 20 , where the home location changes .",
    "each user can be characterized by a similar plot .",
    "the prediction task can now be re - formulated as follows : given a sequence of stops up to step @xmath20 , can we predict your next stop at step @xmath21 ?",
    "notice that a key difference from the cell grid formulation is that in this case there are ( by definition ) no self - transitions ; we are interested in the place changes only .    as before ,",
    "we start by investigating the upper predictability limit bound . fig .",
    "[ fig : predictability ] shows how the maximum predictability for the stops formulation is peaked at 0.68 , significantly lower than what we observe in the grid cells formulation .",
    "we now apply the two prediction strategy _ toploc _ and _ markov _ to this new formulation .",
    "the two models remain conceptually the same , but instead of trying to predict the grid cell at each step , they try to predict the next stop ( note that in this formulation we can not use the _ stationary _ strategy , as by construction we are interested in transitions to new places ) . in this case",
    "we also fit each user separately , and we perform the prediction in an online manner . fig .",
    "[ fig : stops - toploc - markov ] shows the accuracy for both models .",
    "it is evident that the accuracy for these models ( around 0.3 for toploc and 0.4 for markov ) is significantly lower in the next - place formulation , indicating that this problem formulation presents a more difficult task .",
    "we have investigated how the details of the problem formulation strongly impact the reported accuracy for location prediction tasks .",
    "we now focus on next - place prediction and study the influence of different contextual features on the prediction task .",
    "we formalize the problem as follows . at each step , we want to compute the most probable next location given the current location . we may also want to include other context variables , such as time of the day , day of the week , call activity , or distance from home for example .",
    "in other words we want to compute @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the next location , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are the variables representing different contexts . for this purpose",
    "we use a logistic regression model , and we study the usefulness of various predictor features . the goal of the model is not to suggest a new state - of - the - art method , but rather to evaluate the importance of individual contextual features . specifically , we consider the current location , the time metadata ( hour of the day , day of the week , hour of the week , weekend ) , a ` home ' binary indication , distance from home , call and sms activity , and bluetooth proximity . table  [ tab : features ] provides a summary of the features .",
    ".description of the features used for the logistic regression models . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we model each user separately since we want to perform next - place prediction at the individual level . as before ,",
    "we perform an online prediction where we fit the data up to step @xmath20 , and we predict the next location at step @xmath21 . for each user",
    ", we fit a logistic regression model using all the individual features separately , and then a model with all features .",
    "[ fig : stops - acc ] shows the accuracy for each of the models , averaged by user .",
    "the markov chain model baseline is highlighted in red . using the current location and time features",
    ", the logistic regression model outperforms the markov chain based model . even using the current location",
    "only ( which is conceptually very similar to a markov chain model ) , the logistic regression shows stronger performance , likely due to the explicit optimization of the model .",
    "it is also interesting that other context variable such as call and sms data have little predictive power in this model formulation .",
    "the most complex model that considers all features is practically identical in performance to the model using only current location and hour of the week .",
    "although the logistic regression model does improve the accuracy over the markov model , the absolute value of accuracy is remains low ( below 45% ) .",
    "we therefore investigate the possible reasons of this difficulty in prediction .",
    "it is well known that the majority of individuals tend to spend most of the times at very few places such as home and work , and only sporadically visit other places .",
    "this phenomenon has been described using concepts such as preferential return  @xcite , heavy - tailed stay times and return rate based on the number of visits  @xcite . for the location prediction tasks ,",
    "the consequence is that the target classes are very unbalanced , which implies that most records belong to very few classes and most classes are represented by only few records . to illustrate this issue",
    ", we consider the extreme case of places visited only once .",
    "[ fig : visited_once ] shows that surprisingly this fraction is quite large ( 0.7 ) .",
    "this fact is , in large part , the central reason behind the difficulty of the prediction task .        as we shall see below",
    ", another central challenge is not just that our population visits a large number of different places , but also that many new places are discovered over time .",
    "we consider a stop at a location as `` exploration '' if this place has not been seen in the location history so far for a given user .",
    "in other words , this place is being visited for the first time by the user . to express this formally , we consider the sequence of stops @xmath27 for each user .",
    "we consider a stop @xmath28 as _ return _ @xmath29 if @xmath28 has been seen before in the location history , that is there exists a stop @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "otherwise we consider stop @xmath28 an _ exploration _",
    "@xmath32 , that is the place @xmath28 is visited for the first time at step @xmath33 . for example given a location sequence a b a c b c , the target variable exploration would have values 1 1 0 1 0 0 .",
    "we can then estimate the probability of exploration as fraction of explorations over the number of stops . to our surprise , this probability is particularly large : between 0.2 and 0.25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : p_exploration ] ) .",
    "this implies that most users discover a new place every 4 or 5 stops .",
    "the fact that a large fraction of stop - locations have never been seen before poses a challenge for the prediction task , since by construction any model that tries to predict a place from an alphabet of previously visited places will be unable to predict new , unseen symbols .",
    "moreover , another consequence of this frequent exploration is that the pool of possible places constantly grows over time and , given the longitudinal nature of our dataset , ends up being very large .",
    "[ fig : exploration_week ] shows how the average number of new place explored per week remains approximately constant around 4 , and consequently the total number of places keeps growing to hundreds of places ( fig .",
    "[ fig : exploration_cumulated ] ) .",
    "this is a problem for the prediction task , as the number of possible places that the classifier needs to choose from increases constantly .",
    "in fact if we measure the relation between the number of unique places per user and the performance of the best performing logistic regression model using pearson s correlation coefficient , we find a quite strong negative correlation ( @xmath34 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "on the other hand we find no significant correlation for accuracy with period length or number of stops .",
    "these facts suggest that the exploration phenomenon is a key reason for the relatively low accuracy of mobility prediction tasks at high spatial resolution .",
    "given the importance of exploration , we now consider a novel task in mobility prediction : exploration prediction .      the exploration prediction task can be stated as follows : given a user s location history up to step @xmath20 , will the stop at step @xmath21",
    "be an exploration or a return ?",
    "the first question is : what should be the baseline model for the exploration prediction task ?",
    "surprisingly , most literature on human mobility prediction has focused on next location prediction but has overlooked the exploration prediction problem , and to the best of our knowledge no suitable solution has been proposed for this task . we therefore suggest , as a reasonable baseline , random guessing with probability equal to our prior knowledge of the fraction of explorations : @xmath35 .",
    "for our main model we use as before the logistic regression model with the same features constructed for the next place prediction model .",
    "we also add two additional features : _ explore_now _ and _ explore_before _ , which capture if the current stop or the previous stops were explorations , respectively .",
    "the intuition for these is that multiple explorations may occur in a row , and therefore the current exploration may increase the likelihood for an exploration at the next stop .",
    "as before , we fit each individual separately , and we perform an online prediction , that fits based on the data up to step @xmath20 , and predicts exploration at step @xmath21 .",
    "we fit one logistic regression model for each of the single features , and a more complex model with all the features at once .    measuring the performance of these models",
    "requires a few considerations . in this case , the classification problem is imbalanced , that is the number of positive cases ( exploration ) is much smaller than negative cases ( return ) , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : p_exploration ] .",
    "this implies that accuracy is therefore not a good metric , since a classifier predicting always return ( the most probable class ) would have good performance , but would not be useful .",
    "instead we employ the @xmath36 score , which is the harmonic mean of precision ( the fraction of correctly predicted explorations over all predicted explorations ) and recall ( the fraction of correctly predicted explorations over all true explorations ) .",
    "[ fig : exploration - f1 ] shows the results of the exploration prediction .",
    "score for all models . ]    as we would expect , the model with the most complete set of features outperforms the others . among the single feature models ,",
    "perhaps not surprisingly , the current location feature has the best performance .",
    "this finding can be explained by the role of some places as `` gateways '' for exploration such as public transport hubs ( e.g.  central train station ) .",
    "the individual features that perform also well are the time - related ones , in agreement with the intuition that exploration tends to happen to at specific times of the day or week .",
    "the _ explore_now _ and _ explore_before _ also perform well , suggesting an element of burstiness in the exploratory behavior .",
    "if we consider our best performing model , we find that it has average precision of 0.3 and recall of 0.65 .",
    "overall the performance of this model is far from perfect , showing that the exploration prediction problem is a challenging one .",
    "in this paper we first show that when interpreting results of predictive performance there are a number of factors that must be taken into consideration . the problem formulation is the central factor what should be taken into account when",
    "interpreting predictability results , since e.g.  predicting the next time - bin is a very different ( and much easier ) task than predicting the next transition .",
    "we show that the most challenging problem is the next - place prediction , which is arguably the most useful task for practical applications such as travel recommendations .",
    "another issue to be taken into account is the spatial resolution of the prediction , here we show how more coarse spatial precision results in an easier task . similarly the time resolution also has an effect on the predictive power .",
    "we suggest that the factors described in this paper should be taken in consideration as context when comparing results from prediction models .",
    "other than the factors discussed above , we believe that one further reason for performance differences could be the demographics of the dataset .",
    "the population under study is here composed by students that have no single workplace but tend to change multiple classes per week , even multiple times per day .",
    "moreover a younger population may have a more irregular schedule and more exploratory behavior .",
    "certainly more work is needed to conclusively link demographics and predictability . for future directions , we suggest considering demographic factors when trying to characterize human mobility , as it has been done , for example , by linking changes in mobility patterns with unemployment status  @xcite .",
    "we also discussed the issue of exploration , and we show how frequently new places are discovered . based on that , we show that the mechanism of exploration is an important part of human mobility and plays a role in next - place prediction . because any model that tries to predict a next place from a set of visited place will fail when an exploration occurs .",
    "this problem has rarely been addressed in mobility prediction literature , which almost always assumes that the next place can be determined from the past history . providing a full solution for next",
    "explored place prediction is beyond the scope of this work , and here we simply aim to stress the fact that the prediction of explorations is very different from the predictions to returns to known places",
    ". some previous work on next - place prediction using social information  @xcite or nearby points of interest  @xcite may be the starting point for investigating this problem .    in this sense , we raise the question on whether the simple location history is enough for accurate next - place prediction .",
    "as we have discussed , there are indeed a lot of regularities both in the sequence of visits , and in the daily and weekly temporal patterns of visitation .",
    "however there are a lot of `` exceptions to the rules '' , where schedules change , plans are canceled , and people run late .",
    "we speculate that other channels such as email , social media , calendar , class schedule may be needed for achieving a satisfying accuracy in the prediction task .",
    "this work is funded in part by the high resolution networks project ( the villum foundation ) , as well as social fabric ( university of copenhagen ) .",

    "<S> predictive models for human mobility have important applications in many fields such as traffic control , ubiquitous computing and contextual advertisement . </S>",
    "<S> the predictive performance of models in literature varies quite broadly , from as high as 93% to as low as under 40% . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate which factors influence the accuracy of next - place prediction , using a high - precision location dataset of more than 400 users for periods between 3 months and one year . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is easier to achieve high accuracy when predicting the time - bin location than when predicting the next place . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we demonstrate how the temporal and spatial resolution of the data can have strong influence on the accuracy of prediction . </S>",
    "<S> finally we uncover that the exploration of new locations is an important factor in human mobility , and we measure that on average 20 - 25% of transitions are to new places , and approx . </S>",
