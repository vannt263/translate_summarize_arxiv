    "the magnetic properties of low dimensional systems have been the subject of intense theoretical and experimental research in recent years .",
    "it is by now well established that one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnets with integer spin have a gap in the excitation spectrum , whereas those with half - integer spin have gapless excitations .",
    "the former have a finite correlation length , while for the latter it is infinite with the spin - spin correlation function decaying to zero as a power law . in 2-dimensions ,",
    "the unfrustrated square - lattice heisenberg model has long range nel order in the ground state .",
    "it has gapless goldstone modes as expected . in recent years",
    "much interest has focussed on systems with intermediate dimensionality and on questions of crossovers between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "one approach to this problem has been to study a two - dimensional system where the coupling for the spins separated along the @xmath5-axis is different from those separated along the @xmath6-axis @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that an alternative way to explore this issue is through the heisenberg spin ladders consisting of a finite number of chains coupled together , with a coupling @xmath7 along the chains and @xmath8 between them .",
    "these systems have been the subject of considerable recent theoretical and experimental interest .",
    "experimentally , 2-chain @xmath9 ladders are realized in vanadyl pyrophosphate @xmath10@xcite and in the strontium cuprate @xmath11@xcite , whereas 3-chain @xmath9 ladders are realized in the strontium cuprate @xmath12@xcite .",
    "theoretically , a number of striking predictions have been made for such systems .",
    "these have been recently reviewed by dagotto and rice@xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite were the first to carry out extensive monte carlo studies of the excitation spectrum and the magnetic susceptibility for 2-chain ladders with antiferromagnetic interchain coupling .",
    "white@xcite _ et al .",
    "_ and hida@xcite have used the density matrix renormalization method to study the spin gap .",
    "watanabe@xcite has applied the numerical diagonalization method to finite systems of 2-chain ladders with ferromagnetic interchain coupling .",
    "developed a mean - field theory and used the density - matrix renormalization group method to study 2-chain ladders .",
    "gopalan , rice and sirgrist@xcite presented a variational wavefunction for the ground state of the 2-leg ladder .",
    "rojo@xcite has shown that spin ladders with odd number of legs have gapless excitations .",
    "@xcite have used improved versions of the quantum transfer - matrix algorithm to study the temperature dependence of the susceptibility , specific heat , correlation length etc of 2-chain ladders .",
    "finite - size scaling was used by hatano@xcite for multi - leg ladders , and recently frischmuth _ et al._@xcite and sandvik _ et al._@xcite have applied quantum monte carlo simulation to compute the temperature dependence of uniform susceptibility and internal energy for spin ladders with up to 6 legs .",
    "one clear result from all these studies is that ladders with an even number of legs have an energy gap , short range correlations and a  spin liquid \" ground state .",
    "on the other hand , ladders with odd number of legs have gapless excitations , quasi long range order , and a power - law falloff of spin - spin correlations , similar to single chains .",
    "experiments also confirm these features .",
    "we have carried out extensive series studies of 2-chain and 3-chain ladder systems with both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic interchain coupling @xmath8 , via ising expansions and dimer expansions at @xmath0 , and also by high temperature series expansions .",
    "our results confirm the existence of a gap in the 2-chain system and delineate the phase diagram in the parameter space of ising anisotropy and the parameter ratio @xmath13 .",
    "the complete spin - wave excitation spectra are computed . for the 3-chain system we are unable to exclude the possibility of a small gap ,",
    "although our results are consistent with a gapless spectrum . in addition , we develop a high - temperature series expansion for the uniform magnetic susceptibility and the specific heat for 2-chain and 3-chain systems with @xmath14 ; the susceptibility of 2-chain ladders is as expected for a system with a spin - gap while that of 3-chain ladders appear to remain finite in the zero - temperature limit suggesting an absence of a spin - gap .",
    "we compare our results in detail with previous calculations .",
    "the hamiltonian of a spin ladder with @xmath15 legs is given by , @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the s=1/2 spin at the @xmath18th site of the @xmath19th chain .",
    "@xmath7 is the interaction between nearest neighbor spins along the chain and @xmath8 is the interactions between nearest neighbor spins along the rungs .",
    "we denote the ratio of couplings as @xmath6 , that is , @xmath20 . in the present paper the intrachain coupling",
    "is taken to be antiferromagnetic ( that is , @xmath21 ) whereas the interchain coupling @xmath22 can be either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic .",
    "this includes the values of interest in the experimental systems discussed earlier where @xmath23 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can set @xmath24 hereafter .",
    "we have carried out three different expansions for the system , the first is the expansion about the ising limit at zero temperature for both two and three - chain ladders .",
    "we have computed the ground state properties as well as the spin - wave excitation spectra by this expansion .",
    "the second is the dimer expansion , again at @xmath0 .",
    "this expansion can be done for the 2-chain system with antiferromagnetic interchain coupling only .",
    "the third is the high - temperature series expansion for the uniform susceptibility of the 2-chain and 3-chain ladders with @xmath25 .      to perform an expansion about the ising limit for this system",
    ", we introduce an anisotropy parameter @xmath5 , and write the hamiltonian in eq.([h ] ) as : @xmath26 where @xmath27 the limits @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to the ising model and the heisenberg model respectively . the operator @xmath30 is taken as the unperturbed hamiltonian , with the unperturbed ground state being the usual nel state for antiferromagnetic interchain coupling , and a fully ordered collinear state for ferromagnetic interchain coupling . the operator @xmath31 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "it flips a pair of spins on neighbouring sites .",
    "the ising expansion method has been previously reviewed in several articles@xcite , and will not be repeated here .",
    "the calculations involved a list of 9184 linked clusters of up to 16 sites for the 2-chain ladder , and 14082 linked clusters of up to 12 sites for the 3-chain ladder , together with their lattice constants and embedding constants .",
    "series have been calculated for the ground state energy per site @xmath32 , the staggered magnetization @xmath33 for @xmath34 ( or collinear magnetization @xmath33 for @xmath35 ) , the parallel staggered / colinear susceptibility @xmath36 , and the uniform perpendicular susceptibility @xmath37 per site for several ratio of couplings @xmath38 up to order @xmath39 for 2-chain ladders , and @xmath40 for 3-chain ladders ( the series for uniform perpendicular susceptibility @xmath37 is one order less in each case ) .",
    "the resulting series for @xmath41 for the 2-chain and 3-chain systems are listed in tables i and ii , the series for other value of @xmath6 are available on request .    to analyze these series , we first performed a standard dlog pad analysis of the magnetization @xmath33 and parallel susceptibility @xmath36 series .",
    "we found that for 2-chain ladders , the series lead to a simple power - law singularity at @xmath42 : @xmath43 with the indices @xmath44 and @xmath45 close to @xmath46 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "this transition at @xmath48 , with criticality in the universality class of the @xmath49-ising model , is strong evidence that in the heisenberg limit the system has a disordered ground state with a spin - gap , as is the case for the spin - one chain @xcite .",
    "in contrast for the 3-chain ladders , the series analysis showed poor convergence and suggested a singularity at @xmath50 . this implies that for the 3-chain ladders , the system is analogous to the spin - half chain , with gapless spectra and power - law correlations in the heisenberg limit .",
    "1 shows the phase boundary for 2-chain ladders as function of @xmath6 .",
    "it is interesting to note the different behaviour for @xmath34 and for @xmath35 : for antiferromagnetically coupled 2-chain ladders ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath51 decreases as @xmath6 increases , and in the limit of @xmath52 , @xmath51 will approach 0 . but for ferromagnetically coupled 2-chain ladders ( @xmath35 ) , @xmath51 first decreases as the absolute value of @xmath6 increase from zero , but then the trend reverses and it , once again , approaches 1 as @xmath53 . to understand this behavior , we can map the system for large negative @xmath6 to a spin - one chain with on - site ( single - ion ) anisotropy : @xmath54\\ ] ] where @xmath55 denotes the s=1 spin at the @xmath18th site of the chain",
    ". we can get the asymptotic behaviour of the phase boundary in the limit of @xmath53 by studying the following spin - one chain with on - site anisotropy : @xmath56\\ ] ] for this model , we have carried out series expansions in @xmath57 to order @xmath58 ( i.e. 14 sites ) for staggered magnetization @xmath33 for several different value of @xmath59 : @xmath60 , and performed a standard dlog pad analysis to find the critical value @xmath61 which gives the singularity of @xmath33 at @xmath62 .",
    "we get @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the asymptotic behaviour of the phase boundary in the limit @xmath53 is given by @xmath64 which is also shown in fig .",
    "1 as a bold line near @xmath65 .",
    "2 gives the results of the ground - state energy per site @xmath32 versus @xmath6 for both 2-chain and 3-chain ladders at the heisenberg point @xmath29 .",
    "our results for the ground state energy agree extremely well with the recent quantum monte carlo simulation@xcite . in fig .",
    "3 , we present the uniform perpendicular susceptibility at @xmath0 .",
    "we also performed the ising expansion for the triplet spin - wave excitation spectrum of 2-chain and 3-chain ladders using gelfand s method @xcite . to overcome a possible singularity at @xmath42 in the 2-chain ladders , and to get a better convergent series in the heisenberg limit , we add the following staggered field term to the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hising ] ) : @xmath66 @xmath67 vanishes at @xmath29 .",
    "we adjust the coefficient @xmath68 to get the most smooth terms in the series , with a typical value being @xmath69 .",
    "we computed the ising expansion for the triplet spin - wave excitation spectrum @xmath70 up to order @xmath71 for 2-chain ladders , and up to order @xmath72 for 3-chain ladders .",
    "these series are too long to be listed here , but are available on request .",
    "these series have been analyzed by using integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants@xcite .",
    "for the 2-chain ladder , there are 2 bands of excitations , fig .",
    "4 shows the dispersion @xmath70 , with @xmath73 , for antiferromagnetic interchain coupling . the other band with @xmath74 is related to this by @xmath75 .",
    "this is simply due to the staggered field , which doubles the spectrum . as a comparison , the dispersion relation of a single chain ( that is the case of @xmath76 ) is also shown .",
    "it can be seen from the graph that in the limit @xmath77 , the dispersion relation has a simple cosine function with a period of @xmath78 , and in the limit @xmath52 , the dispersion relation also has a simple cosine form with a period of @xmath79 , and a gap in the spectrum .",
    "barnes and riera@xcite argued that the dispersion , for all @xmath6 , can be fitted by combining these two functions into the following form : @xmath80 for @xmath25 , the ising expansions give an energy gap of @xmath81 .",
    "a more precise estimate is obtained by the dimer expansions , which give @xmath82 .",
    "we will discuss the dimer expansions later .    for ferromagnetic interchain coupling , the two bands of spectra are independent , but each band is a simple cosine function with a gap at the minimum and symmetric about @xmath83 , as shown in figs .",
    "5 - 6 . as noted in figs .",
    "4 , it is clear that the spin - gap decreases smoothly as @xmath6 is reduced , and vanishes at @xmath76 .",
    "these results agree well with previous calculations@xcite .    for the 3-chain system , there are three bands . in the ising limit ,",
    "2 bands have initial excitations located in the side rows , and the third band has it in the middle row .",
    "figs . 7 - 12 show the spectrum of the three bands for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interchain couplings . from these graphs",
    ", we can see that all of the dispersion relations have a simple cosine function ( except for middle row band with large @xmath6 ) with a minumum located at @xmath84 ( or @xmath85 by symmetry ) , where two of these three bands have a definite gap , the third ( the @xmath86 band ) is consistent with a gapless spectra .",
    "the estimate for the gap in the third band for all @xmath6 values is @xmath87 ( except for the case of @xmath76 where we got 0.08(10 ) ) .",
    "hence , we can not exclude the possibility of a small gap here .",
    "but our results are consistent with a gapless spectrum , and given our earlier results on the phase boundary with ising anisotropy , we believe the spectra are gapless .      for 2-chain ladders , with antiferromagnetic coupling between the chains , there is an alternative @xmath0 expansion that can be developed . in the limit that the exchange coupling along the rungs @xmath8 is much larger than the coupling @xmath7 along the chains , that is @xmath88 ,",
    "the rungs interact only weakly with each other , and the dominant configuration in the ground state is the product state with the spin on each rung forming a spin singlet , so the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) can be rewritten as , @xmath89 where @xmath90 we can treat the operator @xmath30 as the unperturbed hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenstates of a single pair of spins , or dimers , consists of one singlet state with total @xmath91 and eigen energy @xmath92 : @xmath93 and three triplet states with total @xmath94 and eigenenergy @xmath95 : @xmath96\\ ] ] the operator @xmath31 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "it can cause excitations on a pair of neighbouring dimers .",
    "details of the dimer expansions and the matrix elements of @xmath31 are given in ref . , and will not be repeated here .",
    "we have carried out the dimer expansion for the ground state energy to order @xmath97 and for the lowest lying triplet excitations to order @xmath98 .",
    "the series for the ground state energy per site @xmath32 is : @xmath99\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the series for the excitation spectrum are listed in table iii .",
    "again , we use the integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants@xcite to extrapolate the series . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the dimer expansions give much better results than the ising expansions .",
    "for @xmath101 also the dimer expansions appear to converge better .",
    "the overall spectra determined from the combined study of dimer and ising expansions are shown in fig .",
    "we now turn to the thermodynamic properties of the ladder system at finite temperatures .",
    "we have developed high - temperature series expansions for the uniform magnetic susceptibility @xmath102 and the specific heat @xmath103 , for 2-chain and 3-chain system with @xmath104 , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the number of sites , and @xmath107 , and the internal energy @xmath108 is defined by @xmath109 the series were computed to order @xmath110 .",
    "the number of contributing graphs , with upto @xmath111 bonds was @xmath112 for the @xmath113-chain ladders and @xmath114 for the @xmath2-chain ladders .",
    "the series are listed in table iv .",
    "we use integrated first - order inhomogeneous differential approximants@xcite to extrapolate the series .",
    "the resulting estimates are shown in fig .",
    "13 - 14 . for the susceptibility , as a comparison",
    ", the recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results of frischmuth et al @xcite and the results from our t=0 ising expansion for 3-chain are also shown .",
    "it can be seen that our results agree very well with the qmc results except for the 3-chain system at very low temperatures .",
    "given the recent findings that for the spin - half chain , the @xmath0 value is reached from finite temperatures with infinite slope @xcite , one might expect the @xmath1 behavior for these 3-chain systems to be equally complex , making it very difficult to explore numerically . for the specific heat",
    ", our results showed good convergence upto the peak , but poor convergence below it .",
    "the results for 2-chain ladder are consistent with recent quantum transfer - matrix calculations by troyer@xcite _ et al_.",
    "we have studied the @xmath113 and @xmath2 chain heisenberg - ising ladders by a variety of different series expansions .",
    "our results confirm the existence of a gap in the excitation spectrum of @xmath113-chain systems , with either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interchain interactions . for @xmath2-chain systems ,",
    "our results are consistent with a gapless spectrum .",
    "the @xmath0 phase diagram as well as the temperature dependence of the uniform susceptibility and the specific heat are also calculated .",

    "<S> our results confirm the existence of a gap in the 2-chain heisenberg ladders for all non - zero values of the interchain couplings . </S>",
    "<S> complete dispersion relations for the spin - wave excitations are computed . for 3-chain systems , </S>",
    "<S> our results are consistent with a gapless spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate the uniform magnetic susceptibility and specific heat as a function of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as @xmath1 , for the 2-chain system the uniform susceptibility goes rapidly to zero , whereas for the @xmath2-chain system it approaches a finite value . </S>",
    "<S> these results are compared in detail with previous studies of finite systems .    </S>"
