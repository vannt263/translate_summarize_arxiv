    "since when einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pointed out in 1935 , quantum entanglement has fascinated many physicists because of its counterintuitive nature that a local measurement on a particle may affect the outcome of a local measurement on a distant particle instantaneously  @xcite . after",
    "aspect et al . convincingly tested the quantum nature of entanglement by measuring correlations of linear polarizations of pairs of photons  @xcite , much attention has been paid to this genuin quantum property in various research areas including quantum information theory , quantum communication , quantum cryptography , quantum teleportation and quantum computation .",
    "turning our eyes on cosmology , in de sitter space where the universe expands exponentially , any two of mutually separated region eventually becomes causally disconnected .",
    "this is most conveniently described by spanning open universe coordinates on two open charts in de sitter space .",
    "the positive frequency mode functions of a free massive scalar field for the euclidean vacuum ( the bunch - davies vacuum ) that have support on both regions were derived in  @xcite . using them ,",
    "several studies have been made on the quantum entanglement , particularly , entanglement entropy  @xcite , on negativity  @xcite , which is a measure of entanglement for any mixed states involved in subsystems , and on quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "quantum entanglement between two causally disconnected regions in de sitter space was first studied by maldacena and pimentel  @xcite .",
    "they showed that the entanglement entropy , which is a measure of quantum entanglement , of a free massive scalar field between two disconnected open charts is non - vanishing .",
    "motivated by this result , there have been several attempts to test the idea of multiverse by studying long range correlations of various states that quantum entanglement naturally gives rise to  @xcite .    in order to gain some insight into relativistic quantum information",
    ", qunatum entanglement between causally disconnected regions in flat space was investigated by fuentes - schuller and mann  @xcite by making use of the rindler coordinates .",
    "they studied the entanglement between two causally disconnected modes of a free scalar field as viewed by two relatively accelerated observers in rindler space .",
    "it was found that the entanglement is degraded from the perspective of accelerated observers in flat space and , in particular , the entanglement disappears for an infinitely accelerated observer .",
    "interestingly , however , alsing et al . showed that unlike bosonic fields fermionic fields always remain entangled even in the limit of infinite acceleration  @xcite .",
    "then datta showed that quantum discord , which is a measure of all quantum correlations including quantum entanglement , never disappears in this limit  @xcite .",
    "the two open charts of de sitter space are analogous to the rindler wedges in flat space in the sense that an observer in the region described by one of the charts has no access to the field modes in the other causally disconnected region .",
    "therefore it is of interest to see how the spacetime curvature will affect these results obtained in flat space .    in this paper",
    ", we first study the bunch - davies vacuum of the dirac field in open charts by extending the previous work on scalar fields  @xcite .",

    ", we derive the mode functions in each of the two open chart regions . in section 4",
    ", we analytically extend the solutions to construct the positive frequency mode functions for the bunch - davies vacuum . in section 5",
    ", we present the bunch - davies vacuum solutions in the open chart . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss the absence of supercurvature modes for fermions . in section 7",

    "however , one should note that the scalar field entanglement entropy shows a strange behavior as the mass decreases . for @xmath264 ( @xmath265 ) ,",
    "the entanglement entropy once decreases as the mass decreases .",
    "it is known that there exits a supercurvature mode for @xmath264 , and its contribution to the long - distance correlation becomes more and more dominant as @xmath266  @xcite . at the moment we have no clue about how the supercurvature mode affects the entanglement .",
    "it seems possible that the contribution of the supercurvatue mode , if it could ever be computed , would dominate the entanglement entropy of the scalar field in the small mass limit .",
    "this issue needs further studies before we make a firm conclusion .",
    "we studied the entanglement entropy of a free massive dirac field between two causally disconnected open charts in de sitter space . for this purpose",
    ", we first derived the bunch - davies vacuum mode functions of the dirac field in the coordinates that respect the open chart .",
    "we then gave the bogoliubov transformation between the bunch - davies vacuum and the open chart vacua that makes the reduced density matrix diagonal .",
    "we derived the reduced density matrix in one of the open charts ( @xmath44 region ) after tracing out the other ( @xmath4 region ) and found that the fermi - dirac distribution is realized in the limit of masslessness .",
    "we then computed the entanglement entropy of the dirac field by using the reduced density matrix .",
    "we compared the entanglement entropy of one degree of freedom of the dirac field with that of a scalar field calculated by  @xcite .",
    "we found that the entanglement entropy for the dirac field gets more entangled than that for a scalar field as @xmath0 becomes small , and the difference is maximal in the massless limit .",
    "this is because the contribution of the states from large scales to the entanglement entropy becomes large for the massless dirac field compared to the case of the massless scalar field .",
    "but there is a caveat . in the computation of the entanglement entropy of a scalar field",
    ", it is assumed that the supercurvature mode does not contribute .",
    "if this assumption were wrong , the entanglement entropy of the scalar field might become larger than that of the dirac fermion in the small mass limit . in connection with this issue",
    ", we also showed that there is no supercurvature mode for the dirac field .",
