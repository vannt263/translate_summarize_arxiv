    "hybrid systems containing superconducting and ferromagnetic elements gained recently a lot of attention due to experimental progress as well as possible applications in magnetoelectronics and quantum information .",
    "theoretical studies are revealing a variety of new features , making these system generators of novel theoretical concepts .",
    "it is a common knowledge that current in hybrid normal metal  superconductor ( ns ) systems flows by means of andreev reflections : an electron in n is reflected from the ns interface as a hole with the opposite charge and velocity .",
    "imagine first that the piece of normal metal is ballistic .",
    "an electron at the fermi surface is reflected as a hole at the fermi surface , and they propagate in the normal metal with the same phase . if the electron is taken at a finite energy @xmath1 ( counted from the fermi surface ) , a momentum mismatch @xmath2 between this electron and the reflected hole appears , @xmath3 being the fermi velocity .",
    "consider now an interface between an ( @xmath4-wave ) superconductor and a ferromagnet .",
    "electron and hole have opposite spin directions , and the exchange field @xmath0 in the ferromagnet leads to a zeeman splitting of energies of the two different spin projections .",
    "thus , even an electron and a hole at the fermi surface acquire the momentum mismatch @xmath5 ; hence their relative phase grows as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the distance from the interface .",
    "this affects phase - sensitive physical quantities like the supercurrent in superconductor  ferromagnet  superconductor ( sfs ) junctions : it becomes an oscillating function of the thickness @xmath8 of the ferromagnetic layer , with a period @xmath9 . if , furthermore , the ferromagnet is diffusive , the oscillating behavior is accompanied by an exponential decay @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the diffusion coefficient .",
    "typically , @xmath0 is much larger than the superconducting gap @xmath12 , and thus the length scales related to the magnetic field are much shorter than the superconducting coherence length @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 in the clean and diffusive case , respectively . in other words ,",
    "the proximity effect is suppressed in the ferromagnet .",
    "this qualitative discussion suggests that the main effect observed in sfs contacts is oscillations of the supercurrent with the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer  the transition from a so - called @xmath16-state ( energy of the contact is minimum for zero phase difference between the superconductors ) to a @xmath17-state ( energy is minimum for a phase difference @xmath17 ) .",
    "this topic was at the focus of attention since the early exploration of the field  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the @xmath17-state was predicted in a variety of sfs junctions : ballistic  @xcite , short diffusive  @xcite , long diffusive  @xcite , ferromagnetic insulating barrier  @xcite , ballistic  @xcite and diffusive  @xcite junctions with a barrier separating two ferromagnetic layers , and ballistic  @xcite and diffusive  @xcite with two tunnel barriers .",
    "the transition to the @xmath17-state was recently observed experimentally in sfs junctions  @xcite .",
    "all these observations are limited to small thickness of ferromagnetic layer(s ) , @xmath18 . for thicker layers",
    ", supercurrent does not exist .",
    "in this situation , it is useful to understand how one can enhance the proximity effect .",
    "several options have been recently discussed in the literature .",
    "first , the above qualitative argument assumes that the pairing between an electron and a hole participating in the andreev reflection is _ singlet _  they have opposite spin projections .",
    "obviously , if the superconductor allows for a non - trivial symmetry of the order parameter , this needs not be the case , and _ triplet _ pairing between an electron and a hole with the same spin projection can arise .",
    "since triplet - paired electron and hole at the fermi surface have no momentum difference , they can propagate with the same phase and enhance the proximity effect .",
    "coupling of two @xmath8-wave superconductors via a ferromagnetic layer has been considered in ref .  .",
    "moreover , triplet pairing can even appear in a contact of an @xmath4-wave superconductor and a ferromagnet , provided the magnetization in the latter is non - uniform  @xcite . in this case , the proximity effect survives at the same distance @xmath13 from the interface as in non - magnetic metals .",
    "indeed , the supercurrent in sfs junctions with non - uniform magnetization is considerably enhanced  @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the supercurrent in a long diffusive sfs junction is exponentially suppressed only _ on average _ ; phenomena related to the proximity effect still occur in such a junction as a result of _ mesoscopic fluctuations _ around average quantities  @xcite .",
    "finally , if the ferromagnetic layer is split into domains , the coherence can be preserved if an electron and a hole propagate between the superconducting electrodes along the two sides of a domain wall  @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we explore a different way to enhance the supercurrent in sfs junctions .",
    "imagine first that the junction is ballistic and the ferromagnetic layer consists of two domains with opposite directions of the magnetization , as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "triplet pairing is not generated in this geometry .",
    "consider an electron and an andreev - reflected hole propagating from left to right between the superconducting electrodes .",
    "they first acquire the relative phase @xmath19 , @xmath20 being the distance traversed in the first ferromagnetic layer . however , in the second layer the exchange field has the opposite sign , and the phase gain @xmath21 partially compensates @xmath22 . for @xmath23",
    "we have full compensation : the ferromagnetic bilayer behaves as a piece of normal ( not ferromagnetic ) metal , and the proximity effect is fully restored .",
    "indeed , previous studies of sfs contacts where the two ferromagnetic domains were separated by a barrier , found that the supercurrent in the antiparallel domain configuration is enhanced with respect to the parallel one  @xcite .",
    "if the domains are identical , there is no transition to the @xmath17-sate in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "below , we consider such a situation quantitatively .",
    "section  [ cleancont ] treats a ballistic sffs junction with two ferromagnetic domains parallel to the superconducting interfaces .",
    "we show that this system behaves as a ballistic sfs junction with an _ effective _ exchange field .",
    "if the widths of the two domains are the same , this effective field vanishes . in the next two sections ,",
    "we study the effect of disorder in the same system and show that supercurrent in diffusive sffs junctions decays exponentially with their width , similarly to sfs contacts without domains .",
    "we consider long junctions , @xmath24 , and assume that the superconducting electrodes do not influence the magnetic structure of the contact .",
    "we consider first a system of two clean ferromagnetic strips  @xcite with the thicknesses @xmath25 and @xmath26 and antiparallel orientations located between two superconductors ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the dynamics of quasiparticles in this system are described by the eilenberger equation , @xmath27_{- } .\\ ] ] here the semi - classical green s function @xmath28 is a matrix in nambu space , @xmath29 which describes the singlet pairing ( the triplet component is not generated in our geometry ) , and the spin index @xmath30 .",
    "the exchange field @xmath0 is zero in the superconducting banks , and has antiparallel orientations in the ferromagnets : the upper / lower signs in eq .",
    "( [ eilenb ] ) corresponds to the left / right ferromagnet ( @xmath31 ) . to stay in the framework of the semi - classical consideration",
    ", we have assumed that the zeeman splitting @xmath0 is much weaker than the fermi energy , but can be arbitrary in comparison with the superconducting gap @xmath12 .",
    "we put @xmath32 ; it will be restored in the final results .",
    "setup with two ferromagnetic domains with antiparallel configurations . ]    in this article , we consider the case of a _ long contact _ : the thicknesses of both ferromagnetic layers are much larger than the superconducting coherence length , @xmath33 . then the matrix @xmath34 can be taken in a piecewise approximation : it is zero in both ferromagnets , and @xmath35 in the superconductors .",
    "here @xmath36 and @xmath37 in the left and the right superconducting bank , respectively .    in the bulk superconductor",
    "far from the contacts the green s function is isotropic and equals for @xmath38 @xmath39 in addition , the green s function and its derivative must be continuous at each interface .",
    "we introduce the coordinate @xmath7 parallel to @xmath40 and directed from left to right .",
    "let us choose @xmath41 at the boundary of the left superconductor ; then @xmath42 at the interface of the two ferromagnets , and @xmath43 at the boundary of the right superconductor .",
    "the quasiparticles in the clean system move along a straight line ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eilenb ] ) that the normal component @xmath44 is constant along the trajectory inside the ferromagnets .",
    "the calculation gives @xmath45 where the phase @xmath46 accumulated along the trajectory is @xmath47    the supercurrent density is expressed as follows , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the density of states .",
    "for @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ supercur1 ] ) gives the supercurrent of a long clean sns ( non - ferromagnetic ) junction , as considered in ref .  , which we follow in the general case .",
    "the expression is even in @xmath51 ; for zero temperature ( case of interest here ) the summation can be replaced by an integration over frequencies .",
    "we subsequently introduce a new integration variable @xmath52 and arrive at the intermediate expression @xmath53 . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for long contacts , @xmath54 , the first term in the argument of the hyperbolic tangent can be disregarded . using the identity @xmath55",
    "we obtain the final expression for the supercurrent , @xmath56    for @xmath50 , we return to the clean long sns contact , @xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "this describes the well - known sawtooth current - phase relation found earlier in ref .  .",
    "for strong magnetic fields , @xmath59 , the integral over @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ supercur3 ] ) , which corresponds to summing over all possible trajectories in the ferromagnets can be calculated in the saddle - point approximation . as a result",
    "we find the current - phase relation @xmath61 we note , first of all , that the _ amplitude _ of the supercurrent oscillations as a function of @xmath62 decreases algebraically with the exchange field , as @xmath63 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the fact that we summed over all possible trajectories , and hence averaged over the different phases acquired during propagation in the ferromagnetic domains along these trajectories .",
    "secondly , as far as the _ phase - dependence _ of the supercurrent is concerned , it is in general neither sinusoidal , nor saw - tooth - like . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot @xmath64 for various values of @xmath65 10 , such that the saddle - point approximation is reasonable .",
    "we see that , as a function of the exchange field , the supercurrent changes sign at a given phase difference .",
    "thus , depending on the parameter @xmath66 , the junction either favors a 0-state or a @xmath17-state .",
    "we finally note that for @xmath67 , eqs .",
    "( [ supercur3 ] ) and ( [ supercur4 ] ) give the supercurrent for a ( single - domain ) clean long sfs junction .",
    "this is , to our knowledge , a new result as well .",
    "it implies in particular that a clean sfs junction can also be a @xmath17-junction , in accordance with previous results for different types of sfs hybrid structures .",
    "supercurrent @xmath68 in units of @xmath69 as a function of @xmath62 for various values of @xmath0 : @xmath70 = 10.0 ( a ) , 12.0 ( b ) , and 14.0 ( c ) . ]",
    "the important conclusion for the general case is that for a two - domain contact the result is exactly the same as for a sfs junction with the thickness @xmath71 and the _ effective _ exchange field @xmath72 .",
    "in particular , if the thicknesses are the same , @xmath73 , the magnetic field drops out  we obtain the sawtooth current - phase relation ( [ supsns1 ] ) like for a sns contact . in the language of eilenberger equations , this statement is obvious : indeed , the only quantity sensitive to the magnetic field is the phase @xmath46 accumulated along the trajectory .",
    "since each trajectory is a straight line , each layer contributes with a weight proportional to its thickness and with the sign depending on the direction of the exchange field .",
    "this result is readily generalized to the case of many ferromagnetic layers in the antiparallel configuration  @xcite .",
    "now we discuss how our two main observations for the supercurrent  power - law decay with magnetic field and the independence on the magnetic field in the symmetric case @xmath73  react to the presence of disorder . before performing this difficult task in section  [ section4 ] by solving the usadel equations",
    ", we try to use an easy way to understand the effect of impurities in this section .",
    "we introduce randomness in the thicknesses of the layers ( surface randomness ) .",
    "this simple and transparent calculation provides us with results which are clear qualitative predictions to be compared with the conclusions extracted from a more complicated analysis of the usadel equations .",
    "we start from eq .",
    "( [ supercur3 ] ) , and imagine that the interfaces as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are not straight , but exhibit small fluctuations in position .",
    "since there is no scattering at the interfaces , the only effect of such fluctuations is that the thicknesses of the layers become random variables , and the supercurrent  ( [ supercur3 ] ) must be averaged with respect to this randomness .",
    "let us take a gaussian distribution for the difference @xmath74 , @xmath75 where @xmath76 has the meaning of a typical scale of the interface fluctuations , and @xmath77 are the averaged values both thicknesses .",
    "averaging eq .",
    "( [ supercur3 ] ) , we obtain @xmath78 where @xmath79 . in strong fields , @xmath80 , the integral",
    "is calculated in the saddle - point approximation , and only the term with @xmath81 survives , @xmath82 thus , the averaging procedure brings out two , qualitatively new features : ( i ) at high fields , the current - phase relation becomes sinusoidal ; ( ii ) the amplitude of the supercurrent oscillations decays exponentially , rather than algebraically with @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the exchange field still modulates the phase of the oscillations , and can drive the contact to a @xmath17-state .",
    "the property ( i ) stems from phase - averaging over diffusive trajectories and is a common feature of all long disordered sns junctions ( _ _ c__f ref .  ) .",
    "( [ aver2 ] ) does not apply to the symmetric case @xmath83 .",
    "in this situation , for @xmath84 , we have @xmath85 we see that even for the symmetric case the exponential dependence on magnetic field persists .",
    "it reflects the fact that a quasiparticle moving along a single trajectory spends in general unequal times in both layers , and thus the contribution of each trajectory is magnetic field dependent",
    ". however , there is no additional oscillating factor due to the magnetic field : a symmetric junction is never in the @xmath17-state .",
    "these features are confirmed qualitatively in the next section , where we analyze the behavior of a symmetric diffusive sffs junction , using the usadel equations .",
    "we now consider a diffusive sffs junction in the symmetric case @xmath86 . the junction is again assumed to be long , @xmath87 , with @xmath11 being the diffusion coefficient .",
    "if the exchange magnetic energy does not exceed the inverse elastic scattering time , @xmath88 , the green s function is almost isotropic , and the system can be described by usadel equations , @xmath89 = 2 ( \\tilde\\delta f^+_{\\sigma } - \\tilde\\delta^ * f_{\\sigma } ) , \\\\ & & d \\partial_z \\left [ g_{\\sigma } \\partial_z f_{\\sigma } - f_{\\sigma } \\partial_z g_{\\sigma } \\right ] = 2 ( \\omega \\pm ih\\sigma ) f_{\\sigma } - 2\\tilde\\delta g_{\\sigma } ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the constraint @xmath90 . here , as usual  @xcite , @xmath91 and it actually only depends on the distance @xmath92 from the ferromagnet - ferromagnet interface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the upper / lower signs describe the regions @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively , and @xmath95 in the superconductors . in the following ,",
    "we suppress the spin index @xmath96 where it does not lead to ambiguities .    following ref .",
    ", we solve the constraint by introducing two complex - valued fields @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 the equation for @xmath98 in the ferromagnets becomes @xmath100 with the boundary conditions @xmath101 .",
    "the first integral yields @xmath102 where @xmath103 is an unknown constant .",

    "it is important , however , that we _ do not _ assume that the current is conserving ",
    "it follows naturally from the consistency of our solution .    using eq .",
    "( [ usadel2 ] ) , we also write the equation for @xmath97 in ferromagnets , @xmath105 with the first integral @xmath106 now , for the long junctions , the boundary conditions for @xmath97 at @xmath107 are essentially the same they would be at the interface between a semi - infinite superconductor and a semi - infinite ferromagnet . to find these boundary conditions , we write the corresponding equation for the superconductors , @xmath108 taking into account that in the bulk superconductor @xmath109 , in the bulk ferromagnet @xmath110 , and requiring the continuity of @xmath97 and @xmath111 at the interface , we obtain the following boundary conditions , @xmath112 at @xmath113 . although our equations describe the behavior of an sffs junction for an arbitrary relation between @xmath0 and @xmath12 , we concentrate in the following on the case @xmath114 . as we show below ,",
    "in this situation the current @xmath103 is exponentially small , and the boundary condition for @xmath97 reduce to @xmath115 .    since the usadel equations posses obvious symmetries @xmath116 , @xmath117 , in the sequel we only consider @xmath118 .",
    "the field @xmath97 must rapidly decay away from superconductors and stay exponentially small within the ferromagnets . we start first solving eq .",

    "( [ curus1 ] ) .",
    "now we calculate the supercurrent according to eq .",
    "( [ curdif1 ] ) . for high temperatures @xmath138 only the term with @xmath139 is important , and we obtain @xmath140 where we introduced @xmath141 . in high magnetic fields",
    "@xmath142 the terms with @xmath143 contribute , @xmath144 we note the two main features of the solution in the diffusive case .",
    "first , the current - phase relation is sinusoidal .",
    "this corresponds to the result for the long diffusive sns contact  @xcite .",
    "then , the supercurrent decays exponentially with magnetic field , in contrast to the power - law decay in the clean case .",
    "similarly , we can treat a single - layer sfs junction of a thickness @xmath8 .",
    "the result for @xmath145 reads @xmath146 thus , comparing eq .",
    "( [ surdif4 ] ) with eq .",
    "( [ surdif3 ] ) we see that a long diffusive sfs contact can be a @xmath17-junction , depending on the thickness of the ferromagnet , whereas a similar symmetric sffs contact with anti - parallel configuration of the domains is not a @xmath17-junction .",
    "we considered the behavior of the supercurrent in long sfs junctions .",
    "we obtained new expressions for single - domain ballistic and diffusive contacts and confirmed that the @xmath16 to @xmath17 transition can be induced in these systems .",
    "however , our main focus is on the situation when the ferromagnetic region is split into two ferromagnetic domains with equal but opposite magnetization . in the ballistic case",
    ", this system behaves as a single - domain sfs junction , with the effective exchange field @xmath147 .",
    "such a system exhibits a non - sinusoidal current - phase relation , and a power - law decay of the supercurrent with thickness and exchange field . if the thicknesses of the both domains are the same , the effective field vanishes .",
    "disorder , considered both as geometrical fluctuations of the thickness , or randomly positioned impurities , restores exponential decay and sinusoidal phase dependence of the supercurrent .",
    "a system with two domains of the same width is never in the @xmath17-state .    to obtain these results",
    ", we made a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "the superconductor - ferromagnet interfaces , as well as the boundary between the two ferromagnetic domains , are assumed to be ideal ( no scattering ) and sharp .",
    "this can be realized in multilayered structures , where the ferromagnetic layers can be artificially constructed and kept very clean .",
    "another , more attractive option , is real ferromagnetic domains .",
    "a domain wall has a finite width , typically of order of the mean free path , or wider .",
    "this induces reflection of electrons from the domain wall , and additionally generates the triplet pairing between electrons and holes .",
    "these factors need to be taken into account for a quantitative comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "however , we do not expect them to add qualitatively new features into the picture we presented .",
