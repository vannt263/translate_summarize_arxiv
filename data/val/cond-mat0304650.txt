    "boseeinstein condensates ( bec ) of alkali atoms @xcite as sources of coherent matter waves are of considerable interest in atom optics and interferometry . the first atom interferometry experiment using a bec",
    "was performed in 1997  @xcite . since then",
    ", interferometry has been used to probe the condensate coherence length  @xcite , to give a signature for the mott insulator transition in an optical lattice  @xcite and to test restricted geometry effects  @xcite .",
    "this last example is a witness to the increasing interest in bec in reduced dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the 2deg ( two - dimensional electron gas ) is a very rich system in condensed matter physics , giving rise for example to the fractional quantum hall effect  @xcite and to anyonic quasi - particles  @xcite .",
    "it is also a convenient medium for electronic interferometry  @xcite . by analogy , a 2dag ( two - dimensional atomic gas )",
    "would give access to a new regime of quantum degeneracy  @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical work investigating this field predicts specific phenomena not encountered in the 3d geometry , such as a progressive coherence below a critical temperature and a modification of the mean field interaction  @xcite .",
    "the realization of a 2d condensate is also a preliminary step for the production and the manipulation of anyonic quasi - particles  @xcite .",
    "finally integrated atom optics , where the matter waves can be guided in an arbitrary way , represents an important technological challenge .",
    "the most convenient ways to realize a 2d confinement of alkali atoms use either zeeman interaction  @xcite or ac stark optical potentials  @xcite .",
    "the zeeman method is based on the current - carrying micro wires technique which has been used with success to produce bec in quasi-1d geometries  @xcite .",
    "this technique may be adapted to produce an exponentially decaying b field  @xcite .",
    "the advantage is the use of a simple device yielding a large energy spacing of the lowest - lying vibrational levels .",
    "the main drawback is the heating produced by proximity magnetic fields above the metallic surface , due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "atoms sitting at distances below 1 micrometre will eventually suffer a high rate of scattering  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", no experimental demonstration of this suggested mechanism has yet been realized",
    ".    on the other hand 2d trapping with dipole forces has been performed in standing waves  @xcite or with atoms stopped by an evanescent wave and transferred to the nodes or anti - nodes of a far off - resonant standing wave close to a metallic or dielectric surface  @xcite .",
    "an inhomogeneous trap in one direction is also naturally produced with two evanescent light waves and the resulting morse - like potential is conservative for sufficiently large frequency detunings .",
    "this idea was proposed more than ten years ago by ovchinnikov _",
    "et al . _",
    "a good trap geometry is not the only issue for the realization of a 2d gas .",
    "an efficient loading of this trap is also essential .",
    "a loading scheme of a double evanescent wave trap ( dewt ) based on a dissipative transfer of cold atoms has been previously proposed by dalibard and desbiolles  @xcite and extended for larger frequency detunings  @xcite .",
    "recently , a group in innsbruck succeeded for the first time in loading a dewt from a dense dipole trap with 20  000  cs atoms at a temperature as low as 100  nk  @xcite .",
    "all those mechanisms deal with non - condensed atoms .",
    "our paper focuses on the loading of a dewt from a bec cloud .",
    "we address here two types of loading process and compare their advantages .",
    "our approach is based on adiabatic transformations of combined magnetic plus dipole traps up to the final stage of a dewt .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section  [ principle ] describes the principle of the dewt and gives our proposed parameters ; section  [ loading ] explains the method of loading starting from two different kinds of trap : ( i ) the usual magnetic ioffepritchard trap or ( ii ) the anti - nodes of a moving red - detuned standing wave as a conveyor belt from the magnetic trap to the dewt .",
    "details are given in this section about the numerical solutions of the time - dependent grosspitaevskii equation . in section  [ section_results ] , we present the experimental apparatus and give our preliminary results : production of a @xmath2rb bec near a dielectric surface and transportation of a thermal cloud to this surface .",
    "let us first recall briefly the criterion for reaching the 2d regime for atoms confined in a 3d harmonic trap , with trapping frequencies @xmath3 . in the case of a degenerate bose gas , the chemical potential @xmath4 calculated for the 3d geometry should fulfil the inequality @xmath5 .",
    "this leads to a constraint on the atom number @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xcite . with the parameters of @xmath2rb one",
    "gets @xmath8 .",
    "by contrast , a 2d classical gas is obtained if @xmath9 .",
    "this makes sense if the transition temperature @xmath10 also fulfils this inequality .",
    "the requirement on the atom number for a classical 2d gas is thus @xmath11 where @xmath12 whatever the atom .",
    "@xmath13 is less than @xmath14 as soon as @xmath15 is less than @xmath16  khz for @xmath2rb , which is the case in most experiments including ours .",
    "we will discuss the validity of the 2d regime in our case later in this section .    the quasi-2d trap we describe in this paper was first proposed by ovchinnikov  _ et al . _",
    "it consists in two evanescent light waves produced by total internal reflection at the surface of a dielectric material ( see figure  [ prism ] ) .",
    "one of the light fields is red - detuned by @xmath17 with respect to the atomic transition whereas the other one is blue - detuned by @xmath18 .",
    "the angles of incidence of both beams at the dielectricvacuum interface are chosen such that the decay length of the red field @xmath19 is larger than the decay length of the blue field @xmath20 . the light shift produced by the two fields results in a morse - like potential along @xmath21 , with a long - range attractive potential and a short - range repulsive wall near the surface . a radial confinement ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions )",
    "is achieved with appropriate waists for the red and the blue beams , typically choosing a smaller waist for the red beam .",
    "the overall potential seen by the atoms also includes the van der waals attractive potential towards the dielectric surface .",
    "axis ) , and a blue - detuned one prevents atomic adsorption through a short - range repulsive potential . also shown is our choice of polarizations of the incident beams ( te or tm).,width=283 ]    as our goal is to load such a trap with a degenerate bose gas , we paid particular attention to keep the spontaneous emission rate as low as possible",
    ". the light shift of a field of intensity @xmath24 detuned by @xmath25 scales as @xmath26 whereas the spontaneous scattering rate scales as @xmath27 . at constant light shift ,",
    "the use of larger detunings and therefore larger intensities is thus preferable .",
    "the practical constraints on the availability of laser sources led us to the choice of a yag laser of a few watts at 1064  nm for the red field and a laser source of a few hundred milliwatts detuned by a few nanometres for the blue field , typically a titaniumsapphire laser .",
    "note that the innsbruck group came to the same conclusions  @xcite .",
    "we now give the expression of the 2d trapping potential for @xmath2rb atoms in the @xmath28 state .",
    "the two trapping beams of wavelength @xmath29 and @xmath30 enter a dielectric prism of refraction index @xmath31 in the @xmath32 plane where @xmath21 is the direction orthogonal to the surface .",
    "the angles of incidence at the dielectricvacuum interface are @xmath33 and @xmath34 , both above the critical angle for total internal reflection @xmath35 .",
    "the decay length of the red evanescent wave is then @xmath36 .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath37 .    as the detuning of the yag laser is large as compared to the fine structure of the excited state @xmath38",
    ", we can consider the transition as a @xmath39 transition .",
    "the light shift of the ground state due to the red field is always scalar , regardless of the polarization of the evanescent light .",
    "therefore , we choose a tm polarization for this beam , which gives rise to a higher transmission coefficient at the dielectricvacuum interface .",
    "we will note @xmath17 the detuning of the yag beam with respect to the d2 line at 780  nm . in the following",
    ", we do not differentiate between @xmath17 and @xmath40 .    on the other hand , as the detuning between the blue field and the d2 line is smaller than @xmath38 we have to take into account the contributions of both d1 ( at 795  nm ) and d2 lines to the light shift .",
    "the detuning with respect to the d2 line will be denoted as @xmath18 , whereas the detuning with respect to the d1 line is @xmath41 .",
    "as @xmath18 is different from @xmath41 , the light shift potential will be scalar only if the polarization of the blue evanescent field is linear . in order to ensure a uniform trapping potential for all zeeman sub - states , we choose a te polarization for the incoming blue wave , which ensures a linear polarization along @xmath23 for the evanescent field .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 and @xmath43 the powers of the red and blue beams respectively _ inside _ the dielectric medium , while @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the beam waists .",
    "the corresponding intensities inside the dielectric at the surface are @xmath46 .",
    "the intensity of each beam at @xmath47 in the vacuum depends on its polarization ( te for the blue beam , tm for the red one ) .",

    "the terms in @xmath55 in the exponential appear because of the projection of the beam profile onto the dielectric surface .",
    "the total potential includes the van der waals interaction with the surface .",
    "one has to go beyond lennard - jones potential in @xmath56 because the distance to the surface is comparable to @xmath57 .",
    "therefore retardation effects can not be ignored .",
    "landragin  @xcite gives an analytical correction to the lennard - jones potential which approximates the exact result with a @xmath58 accuracy between 0 and @xmath59 : @xmath60 with @xmath61 @xmath62    for rubidium in the ground state , the mean value of electric dipole squared is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the bohr radius and @xmath65 the electron charge .",
    ".[values]values of the 2d trap parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in the following we give the trap characteristics for a reasonable choice of parameters for the evanescent light , taking into account the available power of laser sources near 780  nm .",
    "the proposed values of the parameters are indicated in table  [ values ] .",

    "a cut of the potential along @xmath21 for @xmath68 is depicted in figure  [ potential ] , top .",
    "the atoms are trapped at a distance @xmath71  nm from the surface .",
    "the trap depth is 180  khz ( or equivalently @xmath72k ) and is given by the energy difference between the bottom of the trap and the saddle points at @xmath73 , @xmath74 m , @xmath75  nm ( see the contour plot in figure  [ potential ] , bottom ) .",
    "we have checked with a 1d numerical calculation that the tunnelling from the ground state to the dielectric surface is negligible .",
    "the potential is essentially harmonic around the minimum in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 directions where the trapping force results from the transverse profile of both beams .",
    "the oscillation frequency is smaller along @xmath22 due to the angle between the beam axis and the surface . in the @xmath21 direction",
    "the trap deviates rapidly from the harmonic approximation .",
    "however , the computed oscillation frequency along @xmath21 at the bottom of the trap gives a good indication of the anisotropy of the potential : @xmath76  hz , @xmath77  hz and @xmath78  khz .",
    "the aspect ratio is thus 690 along @xmath22 and 420 along @xmath23 . with these parameters , the value of @xmath14 is @xmath79 and we get either @xmath80  khz for @xmath81  atoms or 4  khz for @xmath82  atoms , to be compared to 28  khz .",
    "the system is thus already in the 2d regime for a reasonably high number of atoms .",
    "however , @xmath83 is lower than @xmath14 and the transition temperature corresponds to about 20  khz for @xmath81  atoms and 9  khz for @xmath82  atoms , which means that only thermal clouds close to the transition temperature could be considered as 2d gases .",
    "as this trap is intended to be loaded with a degenerate bose gas , the spontaneous scattering rate at the bottom of the trap is an important parameter .",
    "it is given by the formula @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with our choice of parameters we get @xmath85  s@xmath86 .",
    "this gives a reasonable lifetime for a degenerate gas inside the trap .",
    "the loading of the 2d trap with a degenerate bose gas is one of the major points to be addressed in this type of experiment .",
    "methods for loading similar traps with classical gases have been demonstrated before .",
    "they rely on optical pumping by evanescent waves in the vicinity of the surface  @xcite .",
    "this kind of method is prohibited when dealing with a degenerate gas .",
    "in fact , any interaction of the atoms with resonant light should be avoided in order to preserve coherence and reduce heating . in this paper",
    ", we propose two different methods for loading the atoms from a magnetic trap , centred a few millimetres above the dielectric surface , into the dewt .",
    "the magnetic trap we start with is a standard cigar - shaped quic trap  @xcite with frequencies @xmath87  hz and @xmath88  hz ( see section  [ section_exp ] ) .",
    "both schemes rely on the adiabatic transfer from the magnetic trap into the surface trap .",
    "we give a brief description of the methods and present results of numerical simulations of the two transfer processes .",
    "the first method consists in deforming a translated magnetic trap adiabatically by switching on the evanescent light trap slowly .",
    "the atoms are first translated inside a moving magnetic trap to the vicinity of the surface .",
    "this is done by adding to the quic trap a pair of helmholtz coils with a vertical axis ( see section  [ sec_exp_results ] ) .",
    "at the same time , the blue - detuned evanescent light field is switched on in order to prevent the atoms from sticking to the surface as they come very close to it .",
    "second , the condensate is transferred into the 2d dipole trap by switching on the red - detuned evanescent wave slowly , thus compressing the cloud strongly in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "finally , the magnetic field has to be switched off and the atoms remain trapped in the dewt .",
    "the transfer is adiabatic if the variation of the trap frequency @xmath89 verifies along each direction the following inequality : @xmath90 this implies that the ramping time of the evanescent wave must be very large as compared to the oscillating period of the atoms in the trap .",
    "we present here a 3d numerical calculation of part of this process using the time - dependent grosspitaevskii equation ( gpe ) for the macroscopic wavefunction for a condensate comprising @xmath91  atoms .",
    "the starting point of the calculation is the ground state of a hybrid trap consisting of the blue - detuned evanescent light plus a magnetic harmonic trap centred at the surface ( @xmath47 ) , see figure  [ sim1results](@xmath92 ) .",
    "we then let the wavefunction evolve due to the gpe , while switching on the red evanescent field and the van der waals potential with an exponential time profile .",
    "the total ramping time is @xmath93 .",
    "the calculation ends at time @xmath94 and does not include the magnetic field extinction .",
    "we use the splitting method to evaluate the effect of the total hamiltonian for a time interval @xmath95 : if @xmath95 is small enough , one can let @xmath96 and @xmath97 commute , where @xmath98 is the part of the hamiltonian diagonal in the position basis ( potential energy plus interactions ) and @xmath99 is diagonal in momentum ( kinetic energy ) .",
    "the evolution during @xmath95 leads to @xmath100 where @xmath101 represents a fast fourier transform and @xmath102 its inverse .",
    "we calculate the chemical potential @xmath103 and the initial wavefunction by solving the time - dependent gpe with the method of imaginary time ; we propagate and renormalize @xmath104 at each step using the equation @xmath105 to get a positive chemical potential as small as possible .",
    "the corresponding wavefunction represents the ground state of the gpe and is taken as initial state @xmath106 before deformation .",
    "the subsequent evolution is calculated using equation ( [ schroedinger ] ) ( where @xmath98 is a function of time ) .    the magnetic trap is chosen to be isotropic with an oscillation frequency @xmath107  hz ( oscillation period @xmath108  ms ) to reduce the calculation time .",
    "the 2d trap results from evanescent waves with decay lengths @xmath109  nm and @xmath110  nm .",
    "the light shift at the surface is 5.4  mhz for the blue beam and @xmath111  mhz for the red one .",
    "the oscillation frequencies in the dewt alone are @xmath112  khz along the vertical axis , @xmath113  hz and @xmath114  hz in the horizontal plane . the position of the minimum of the potential well along the vertical direction is about 350  nm above the surface of the prism .",
    "as @xmath115 and @xmath116 are much smaller than @xmath117 , the frequency in the horizontal plane changes only slightly from @xmath117 to _ e.g. _ @xmath118 and the criterion for adiabaticity is easily fulfilled horizontally .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figure  [ sim1results ] .",
    "figures  [ sim1results](@xmath92:@xmath21 ) to [ sim1results](@xmath119:@xmath21 ) represent the spatial atomic density integrated along @xmath22 and @xmath23 as a function of @xmath21 together with the trapping potential along @xmath21 .",
    "figures [ sim1results](@xmath120:@xmath23 ) to [ sim1results](@xmath119:@xmath23 ) show the density integrated along @xmath22 and @xmath21 and plotted as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ sim1results](@xmath92 ) represents the initial atomic distribution ( @xmath121 ) of the @xmath91 atoms , corresponding to the ground state of the hybrid magnetic plus blue evanescent wave trap .",
    "the atomic density along @xmath21 is not symmetrical due to the steep wall produced by the blue beam .",
    "the spatial density for two different ramping times @xmath93 of the red beam is given in figures  [ sim1results](@xmath122 ) and [ sim1results](@xmath119 ) .",
    "we observe that almost all the condensate is transferred into the dipole trap for a ramping time @xmath123  ms much greater than the initial oscillation period @xmath124 , figure  [ sim1results](@xmath119 ) .",
    "we also note that , in this case , the width of the spatial density along the horizontal direction is enlarged when adding the red beam , compare figure  [ sim1results](@xmath119:@xmath23 ) with figure  [ sim1results](@xmath92:@xmath23 ) .",
    "indeed when ramping up the red beam intensity slowly , the atomic cloud is compressed along the vertical axis , figure  [ sim1results](@xmath119:@xmath21 ) , and expands in the horizontal directions where the potential energy increases more slowly with distance from the centre .    on the other hand , for a very short ramping time ( 0.3  ms )",
    ", only a few atoms are transferred into the 2d dipole trap ( figure  [ sim1results](@xmath122 ) ) .",
    "the integrated atomic density along @xmath21 presents three features : we observe two density peaks with a large difference between their amplitude , plus a broad background .",
    "the centre of the smaller peak corresponds to the minimum of the dipole trap and represents the atoms which were transferred successfully .",
    "the larger peak sits at the extreme border of the dipole trap well",
    ". one can understand this with a simple picture .",
    "when we ramp up the red beam quickly , the atoms which were localized at the bottom of the initial potential with almost zero velocity suddenly acquire an energy equal to the depth of the dipole potential .",
    "they populate a very narrow band of excited states of the new well and are essentially located at the turning points of the potential . towards the surface , the potential is very stiff and the atomic velocity changes almost instantaneously . as a result , a single density peak is visible at the right turning point where the potential is much shallower . note that the respective weight of the two peaks changes as the loading time @xmath93 is increased : more atoms are transferred in the dewt , see figure  [ transfer ] , and the second peak is reduced .",
    "the background of the distribution represents the atoms which are not much affected by the switching on of the red beam .",
    "these atoms were out of the well in the right - hand side of the potential when the red beam was ramped up",
    ". the width of the spatial density along the horizontal direction ( figure  [ sim1results](@xmath122:@xmath23 ) ) does not change as compared to figure  [ sim1results](@xmath92:@xmath23 ) due to the poor compression reached in the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the analysis of the transfer efficiency is presented in figure  [ transfer ] . to estimate the number of transferred atoms",
    ", we fit the peak in the @xmath21 density profile corresponding to the atoms trapped in the dewt with a gaussian profile and compare its area to the total number of atoms .",
    "the transfer efficiency increases non linearly with the ramping time . for a ramping time",
    "@xmath125  ms , very large as compared to @xmath124 , the difference between the final density profiles and the ground state of the total trap ( dewt + magnetic trap ) is imperceptible and the transfer is actually adiabatic . from figure  [ transfer ]",
    "we infer that a 20  ms ramping time is quite enough to realize an adiabatic transfer .",
    "note that in the adiabatic case , as we ramp the magnetic trap off very slowly , the spatial density along the @xmath21 axis becomes narrower while the horizontal width becomes larger ( not shown here ) .",
    "indeed , the horizontal frequencies of the dipole trap ( @xmath126  hz , @xmath127  hz ) are smaller than those in the initial trap ( @xmath128  hz ) , and the anisotropy is more pronounced due to the strong confinement along @xmath21 and the interactions between atoms .",
    "the second method makes use of a moving standing wave to transport the atoms from the magnetic trap into the dewt .",
    "the idea is close to the principle of the conveyor belt recently realized on a micro chip  @xcite . at the beginning of the loading process",
    ", the atoms are confined in the magnetic trap and the laser fields producing the dewt are on .",
    "the process may be decomposed into three steps : ( i ) the atoms are loaded at the anti - nodes of a stationary wave into a series of horizontal planes obtained by two red - detuned counter - propagating beams along @xmath21 .",
    "( ii ) the magnetic field is switched off and the atoms are lifted down towards the surface by changing the phase of one of the beams with respect to the other .",
    "the atoms accumulate in the 2d trap by continuous deformation of the potential ( figure  [ lift ] ) .",
    "( iii ) finally , when all the atoms are in the last well near the surface , the stationary wave is switched off and the atoms remain trapped in the dewt .        at each step , the different transfers have to remain adiabatic to avoid any heating of the atomic cloud .",
    "step ( i ) should not pose particular problems as transfer of condensates into optical lattices has already been demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "note that the atoms remain trapped horizontally even after the magnetic field has been switched off due to the gaussian profile of the counter - propagating beams , with corresponding horizontal oscillation frequency @xmath129 .",
    "one simply has to switch off the magnetic field adiabatically , that is in a time larger than @xmath130 .",
    "to realize this first step , one can typically use a @xmath131  nm laser diode with a power of 15  mw in each beam and a waist of @xmath132 m .",
    "this gives @xmath133  hz . provided the populated anti - nodes are far from the evanescent waves , the phase change may be very fast , and this gives the atoms a large translational velocity , @xmath134 .",
    "when the atoms approach the surface , the velocity must be lowered , to @xmath135 say , because the horizontal shape of the trap changes .",
    "in fact the horizontal frequency seen by an atom changes , in the @xmath22 direction for example , from @xmath129 to @xmath136 when it is first loaded in the dewt , and then changes periodically between @xmath137 and @xmath115 as the phase evolves further to load the remaining atoms . this gives the typical time constant for adiabaticity .",
    "we tested this loading scheme qualitatively with a 3d numerical simulation analogous to the one described in the last section .",
    "we were interested mostly in the last stage where the atomic cloud distributed in several planes approaches the surface .",
    "the initial state of the calculation ( @xmath121 ) is the ground state of the gpe in the potential formed by the stationary wave with @xmath138  nm plus a 1d harmonic potential along @xmath21 .",
    "this potential mimics the situation immediately after the transfer from the magnetic trap into the stationary wave .",
    "the 1d potential is centred @xmath139 m above the surface and is switched off at the beginning of the evolution through the time - dependent gpe , while the 2d trap is switched on . at this point",
    "( @xmath140  ms ) , the atoms are spread over a few planes . for an initial vertical oscillation frequency of 300  hz and @xmath81 atoms , typically 15 planes are populated . however , to reduce the calculation time , we start from a condensate in a harmonic trap with a vertical oscillation frequency of 1.6  khz . in this case",
    ", the atoms are spread symmetrically over three planes ( see figure  [ lift_results ] ) .",
    "the relative phase between the two beams of the standing wave is then allowed to evolve , resulting in the two successive velocities @xmath141  mm / s and @xmath142 m/s , as mentioned above .",
    "the results of the numerical calculation are shown in figure  [ lift_results ] . the column density integrated over @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    "is plotted as a function of @xmath21 at three stages of the loading process . at @xmath143",
    "ms ( @xmath92 ) the first populated plane reaches the rim of the last well , which coincides with the 2d trap . at @xmath144",
    "ms ( @xmath122 ) two populated planes have melted into the last well . at @xmath145  ms ( @xmath119 ) the atoms accumulate in the last well . however , it was not possible to fulfil the condition for adiabatic transfer .",
    "as a result , the final atomic density does not coincide with the ground state of the gpe in the dewt .",
    "we shall discuss this point further in the conclusion .",
    "moreover , when the atoms are in the last well of the standing wave before melting , they tunnel through the small barrier separating them from the trap , as can be seen already in ( @xmath92 ) , thus populating excited states of the dewt . to limit this phenomenon ,",
    "both the depth and the typical size of the wells of the standing wave must be adjusted to those of the dewt .",
    "this condition may be a difficult point to address experimentally .",
    "in this section , we present some preliminary experimental results towards loading of a degenerate bose gas into a dewt .      the experimental set - up , figure  [ setup ] , consists of two ultra - high vacuum chambers separated vertically by 75  cm . in the upper chamber ( pressure @xmath146  torr )",
    "the @xmath2rb atoms are collected from a vapour in a standard magneto - optical trap ( mot ) by three retro - reflected beams ( @xmath147-diameter 25  mm each , total power 45  mw ) .",
    "this mot acts as a reservoir for the second mot in the lower cell where the pressure is below @xmath148  torr .",
    "the difference in vacuum pressure is ensured by a tube of length 120  mm with an internal diameter of only 6  mm .",
    "the lower mot is set up with six independent laser beams with a @xmath147-diameter of 10  mm each for a total power of 45  mw .",
    "+        the atoms are continuously transferred into the second cell by an original method combining pushing and guiding the atoms .",
    "the pushing beam has a power of 30  mw and is detuned by 2.5  ghz on the red side of the mot @xmath149 transition .",
    "it is focused 8  cm above the upper mot to a waist of @xmath150 m such that its radius is @xmath151 m at the upper mot and @xmath152 m at the lower mot .",
    "this beam induces sufficiently large light shifts ( 30  mhz ) so that atoms inside the beam no longer feel the mot beams ; the atoms are extracted from the upper mot with a radiation pressure about 25 times smaller than that of a typical mot .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the velocity of atoms remains in the capture range of the lower mot ( about 15  m / s ) .",
    "furthermore , the pushing beam acts as a dipole trap which guides the atoms vertically near its axis inside the small diameter tube .",
    "the depth of this guide is about 1.4  mk at the upper mot for the @xmath153 state .",
    "a collinear repumping beam , tuned to the @xmath154 transition , ensures that the atoms remain in @xmath153 . due to the divergence of the guiding beam the radiation pressure at the position of the lower trap is negligible",
    "the fact that the atoms are guided while pushed towards the lower cell renders the loading process very robust against small changes in the parameters of the two mots .",
    "after 30  s of loading time , the atoms are cooled by molasses cooling , compressed and pumped into the @xmath155 state .",
    "they are then transferred into a ioffepritchard , cigar - shaped magnetic trap .",
    "the coils producing the magnetic field are placed following the quadrupole and ioffe configuration ( quic )  @xcite and dissipate a total electric power of 200  w. they are cooled by thermal contact with water - cooled copper radiators .",
    "two independent current sources are used , one for the ioffe coil ( 43  a ) and one for the quadrupole coils ( 30  a ) .",
    "the resulting magnetic field has a minimum @xmath156 of about 1  g with a field gradient @xmath157  g / cm and a curvature @xmath158  g/@xmath54 .",
    "the resulting oscillation frequencies are 21  hz along the axis of the cigar ( @xmath22 direction ) and 300  hz in the transverse @xmath70 plane for the @xmath155 state .",
    "we achieve boseeinstein condensation after 30  s of rf evaporative cooling .",
    "the condensate contains typically @xmath159 atoms and is produced at the centre of the quic trap , just above the prism which is the support for the 2d evanescent light trap ( see the bottom of figure  [ setup ] ) .",
    "the vertical position of the prism with respect to the condensate may be adjusted mechanically . however ,",
    "it is limited to at least 3  mm to maintain a correct loading efficiency of the mot . by adding to the quic trap a uniform vertical magnetic field varying from 0 to 64  g the minimum of the trapping potential is moved down to the surface of the prism , as required by the first 2d - transfer scheme .",
    "this field is produced by ramping up a current from 0 to 20  a in two additional horizontal coils separated by 4  cm , having each 30 windings of mean diameter 16  cm . during the ramp ,",
    "the current in the quadrupole coils of the quic trap is lowered by about 5% ; otherwise the trap would cross a zero of the magnetic field and the atoms would separate into two clouds .",
    "the resulting potential near the centre of the trap remains essentially unaltered apart from an increase of a factor of 1.6 in the oscillation frequency along the slow axis ( from 21  hz to 33  hz ) .",
    "this axis is also slightly tilted , in agreement with the magnetic field calculations . to illustrate the translation process , we filled the initial quic trap with a sample of thermal atoms at @xmath160k centered 3.7  mm above the prism and imaged the atomic cloud at several steps of its journey towards the surface , figure  [ exp_results ] .",
    "when the current in the additional coils reaches 20  a , the atoms are lost by contact with the surface in the absence of a blue - detuned evanescent wave .",
    "k approaching the prism .",
    "each 2.5  mm  @xmath161  5  mm image is taken 4  ms after switching off the magnetic fields , at different steps of a 1  s , 0 to 20  a current ramp in the additional coils .",
    "the final values of the current are 0 , 10 , 15 and 18.4  a respectively .",
    "when reaching 20  a , the atoms are lost by contact with the surface in the absence of a blue - detuned evanescent wave.,width=283 ]    as the experiment was performed with a non - condensed cloud , the next step will be to extend it to a bec .",
    "the blue and red beams have then to be added to the experimental set - up .",
    "preliminary experiments with a blue beam alone were realized : a bounce of thermal atoms released from the quic trap 3.7  mm above the prism was observed .",
    "however , the detuning @xmath162  mhz was too small for the beam to be used in a loading experiment and it will be replaced by an appropriate laser source",
    ". this should allow us to test experimentally the first transfer scheme .",
    "in this paper , we studied two possible methods for loading a degenerate bose gas into a strongly anisotropic trap .",
    "the first method is also the simpler one .",
    "we have demonstrated experimentally with a thermal cloud the first stage corresponding to the vertical translation of the atomic cloud .",
    "we simulated the transfer from the translated quic trap into the dewt . when the criterion for adiabaticity is fulfilled the transfer efficiency is close to 100% .",
    "the simulation assumed an isotropic magnetic trap with oscillation frequency @xmath107  hz . in the experimental situation , one of the horizontal frequencies is @xmath163  hz only and the loading time may have to be increased by a small factor .",
    "the last stage corresponds to the extinction of the magnetic field and should not pose particular problems providing that the switching time is much longer than the horizontal frequencies in the dewt .",
    "we believe that this loading method could be implemented experimentally .",
    "the difficulty is to adjust the horizontal position of the magnetic trap to the center of the dewt .",
    "this can be done by changing slightly the balance between the currents in the quic coils .",
    "the second method has the great advantage of compressing the atomic cloud already in the quic trap before the atoms are loaded into the dewt",
    ". the translation stage towards the surface ( velocity @xmath134 ) may be faster than in the last method , as the vertical oscillation frequency in the series of planes is on the order of a few tens of khz instead of 300  hz .",
    "the accumulation stage into the dewt by a phase sweep seems to be an elegant idea .",
    "however , the phase velocity @xmath135 is strongly limited if one tries to fulfil the adiabaticity condition .",
    "in fact , for horizontal frequencies @xmath164  hz in the standing wave and @xmath113  hz in the dewt , the frequency change between @xmath115 and @xmath165 has to be slower than @xmath115 .",
    "therefore the velocity @xmath135 has to be much smaller than @xmath166 m/s to avoid 2d breathing mode excitation .",
    "the typical time to load 15 planes is then a few seconds .",
    "this is still an order of magnitude too large to be of interest for practical applications . to reduce this time",
    ", one may either increase the horizontal frequency during the loading process , or compress the cloud initially to populate fewer horizontal planes .",
    "another problem that will occur with this loading method is the phase noise in the standing wave .",
    "the study of its influence on the loading mechanism is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "however , a recent work in bonn showed that it produces heating and reduces the lifetime in a standing wave trap  @xcite .    finally , let us note that the second method may be used in a reversed way to extract the 2dag and study it far from the surface : once the atoms are confined in the dewt , one can slowly switch on a standing wave and change the relative phase to lift the atoms away from the surface .",
    "it is then easier to produce a single 2d trap with a very high aspect ratio with less laser power .",
