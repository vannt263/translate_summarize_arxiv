    "breathers , which also called oscillating solitons , are time periodic and spatially localized excitations ubiquitously found on translationally invariant coupled nonlinear lattice@xcite . it was introduced first in the context of the sine - gordon equation in 1974@xcite .",
    "it requires practically no activation energy and thus bridge the gap between the highly nonlinear modes and the linear phonon modes .",
    "such long - lived spatially localized excitation has fundamental significance in the dynamics of spatially extended systems .",
    "it has been found that the discreteness of a system plays an essential role on the stability of breathers in several systems@xcite .",
    "it introduces a cut - off frequency to the system so that the resonance between the phonon band and the frequency of the discrete breather can be avoided .",
    "however , breathers grow and decay due to their interaction with the environment .",
    "some of such interactions which has been studied include the electron - breather interaction@xcite and the interaction of breathers with extended defect@xcite .",
    "the discrete breather can play a role of the scattering center affecting energy transport by scattering , absorbing or radiating phonons .",
    "since the phonon is a major form of radiations for small amplitude excitations in the nonlinear lattice , it is important to characterize such breather - phonon interaction@xcite .",
    "recently it has been found that scattering properties of the breather are related to the structure of the internal modes of the breather itself@xcite .",
    "they studied the phonon scattering by a kink in the localized equilibria of the nearest neighbor interacting chain and showed that the scattering properties undergo a drastic change , involving a perfect transmission , as the localized eigenmode threshold is passed .",
    "it was conjectured that this result on the static localized structure could be extended to a wide class of systems with time - dependent localized structures such as breathers .",
    "it has also been confirmed in the case of time periodic discrete breather in the hamiltonian nearest neighbor chain both numerically and using the extended levinson theorem@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present the analysis of phonon scattering by breathers in the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation using the transfer matrix method .",
    "we proved analytically that at the localized eigenmode threshold the transmission at the phonon band edge , such that the wave vector @xmath0 , is nonzero , which in fact becomes perfect in the case of symmetric breather .",
    "this result is also confirmed by numerical calculations with transfer matrices .",
    "the crucial difference of the dnls equation from the localized equilibria of the nearest neighbour chain is that it allows two scattering channels@xcite .",
    "this allows occurrence of the perfect reflection whose existence is shown in detail in the weak - coupling limit . a necessary condition for a system to have a perfect reflection is obtained in comparison with the case of the local equilibria in the classical hamiltonian systems .",
    "we end with discussions on extensions of our results to more general systems including the time - periodic discrete breathers in the hamiltonian chain .",
    "there are many ways to discretize the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "one of the widely studied version , called the dnls equation , reads , @xmath1 in which @xmath2 is the amplitude at site @xmath3 and @xmath4 is the coupling strength . if one consider a solution of the form @xmath5 for eq.([eq1 ] ) , @xmath6 s satisfy @xmath7 without loss of generality , we could choose @xmath8 .",
    "we further consider only the 1-site breather , i.e. only one site is excited on the lattice .",
    "hence for zero - coupling the breather solution centered at the origin is given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 for @xmath11 .",
    "in the weak - coupling limit , i.e. if @xmath12 is small , we obtain from eq.([eq2 ] ) @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 etc .",
    "this provides an exponentially localized amplitude profile of the discrete breather which can be continued from a zero - coupling solution@xcite .",
    "the reflection symmetry of the breather with respect to its center will be shown to be important in connection with perfect transmission .",
    "the linearization of eq.([eq1 ] ) around the breather solution with @xmath16 yields , @xmath17 because of the complex conjugate operation on @xmath18 , at least two frequency components are necessary for the solution of eq.([eq4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the dnls equation can allow two scattering channels different from the case of localized equilibria with a single scattering channel@xcite .",
    "if we assume @xmath19 , with @xmath20 and @xmath21 complex , we obtained the following equations : @xmath22 with @xmath23 , the above equation can be written in a recursive form as @xmath24 in which @xmath25 is a function of @xmath26 , @xmath4 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the matrix @xmath25 is called a transfer matrix , which maps a pair of linearized coordinates on one site to another site@xcite . applying eq.([eq8 ] )",
    "successively from the site @xmath29 to the site @xmath30 , one has @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "far from the center of the breather , @xmath6 decays to zero , so that eq.([eq5 ] ) becomes decoupled , with solutions of the form @xmath33 and @xmath34 , in which @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the solutions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 define two possible scattering channels .",
    "each channel can be either a traveling ( phonon ) mode with a real wave vector @xmath37 or an exponentially growing ( decaying ) mode with an imaginary @xmath37 depending upon the values of @xmath38 .",
    "since @xmath4 and @xmath28 occurs only in the form of ratios @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we can set @xmath41 and regard @xmath4 and @xmath28 as dimensionless variables .",
    "the boundaries of the phonon bands are given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these phonon bands divided the parameter space of @xmath4 and @xmath28 into three regions according to the number of traveling channels as shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "in a levison theorem , the bound state property of a system is related to its scattering property@xcite . in",
    "what follows , the property of scattering in region-@xmath44 was related to the property of localized mode in region-@xmath45 .",
    "firstly , we consider the scattering problem in region-@xmath44 . in the standard scattering setup , a phonon is incident with normalized amplitude from the left side of the breather located at the origin .",
    "we assume @xmath46 .",
    "the case with @xmath47 can be handled similarly .",
    "the question asked in a scattering problem is its transmission and reflection coefficients .",
    "it can be shown from the dnls equation that @xmath48 in which @xmath49 is the time average of @xmath50 .",
    "this flux - conservation relation makes the one - channel scattering process elastic , i.e. , @xmath51 is a traveling mode with @xmath52 real , while @xmath53 is imaginary .",
    "the asymptotic solutions are of the form @xmath54 in which the amplitude of the incident phonon on the channel @xmath21 is set to unity . the amplitudes for the transmitted and reflected phonons , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , fully characterize the one - channel phonon scattering by a symmetric breather .",
    "since eq.([eq5 ] ) is not covariant under multiplication of a arbitrary phase factor @xmath57 on @xmath58 and @xmath59 , it may appear that the scattering properties depend on the phase of the input phonon .",
    "however , if @xmath58 and @xmath59 are solutions of eq.([eq5 ] ) , so are @xmath60 and @xmath61 . therefore , transmission and reflection are independent of the phase of the input phonon in the one - channel scattering case .    inserting eq.([eq13 ] ) into eq.([eq8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath62 linear equations with @xmath62 variables to solve for , i.e. @xmath63 for @xmath64 , @xmath65 can be treated as one complex variable .",
    "the resulting @xmath62 homogeneous equations have a non - trivial solution only on their null space .    on the other hand , if both channels are non - traveling modes with both @xmath66 and @xmath67 imaginary . after discarding all exponentially growing parts",
    ", the asymptotic solutions read , @xmath68 the localized eigenmode is given by a solution of @xmath69 non - trivial solutions for this set of equations exist only on its null space . at @xmath64 the null spaces of eq.([eq13_5 ] ) and eq.([eq13_6 ] ) coincide . therefore ,",
    "at the band edge of the channel @xmath21 , @xmath64 , where a localized mode start to appear , we obtain non - zero phonon transmission , @xmath70 .",
    "we can further demonstrate that for symmetric breathers non - zero transmission at @xmath71 at the threshold for localized mode generation becomes perfect one : consider a phonon of unity amplitude incident from the left side of the breather at a small positive wave vector @xmath72 .",
    "near @xmath73 , this scattering configuration can be extended continuously to a small negative value of @xmath72 since the governing equations are smooth functions of @xmath72 .",
    "negating @xmath72 changes the direction of traveling phonons .",
    "the configuration becomes an outgoing phonon of unity amplitude and an incoming phonon of amplitude @xmath74 on the left side of the breather , and an incoming phonon with amplitude @xmath75 on the right side as shown in fig.[fig2]b . for a symmetric breather",
    ", these incoming phonons with a wave vector @xmath76 from the right side of the breather generate outgoing phonons of amplitude @xmath77 and @xmath78 from the left and right sides of the breather , respectively .",
    "the situation in fig.[fig2]b and fig.[fig2]c must coincide for @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and conclude that there must be either perfect transmission or perfect reflection at @xmath81 .",
    "this is a special property of the symmetric breather since we assumed that the transmission and reflection coefficients for a phonon coming from the left side of the breather are the same as those from the right side of the breather . in general",
    ", a scaterring process can be formulated as a set of homogeneous linear equations for the fourier components of the state of the system at each site and casted into a transfer matrix form if the couplings between sites are local and linear .",
    "let @xmath82 be the state vector at site @xmath3 and @xmath83 be the transfer matrix connecting @xmath84 and @xmath85 as in eq.([eq8 ] ) .",
    "if the dimension of @xmath82 is one , the whole vector @xmath82 represents the traveling phonon in the scattering process .",
    "if the incoming phonons from the left side of the breather are perfectly reflected , the @xmath86 should be identical to zero as @xmath87 .",
    "because of the homogeneity of eq.([eq10 ] ) , @xmath88 should also be zero , which implies no non - trivial configuration of perfect reflection is possible .",
    "if the dimension of @xmath82 is greater than one and some components represent the exponentially decaying parts , @xmath86 need not to be zero in the @xmath87 limit in spite of the perfect reflection .",
    "it becomes possible to match non - zero @xmath88 , which represents the input and reflection of phonons , with @xmath86 by the transfer matrix .",
    "therefore , the existence of additional channels with exponentially decaying parts is essential for a perfect reflection to occur in a linear scattering problem .",
    "hence , there is no perfect reflection in two - channel phonon scattering of the dnls equation , i.e. in region-@xmath89 of fig.[fig1 ] , since all components of @xmath82 represent traveling phonons .",
    "this provides a necessary condition for a linear - system to allow a perfect reflection .",
    "our derivation does not depend on the specific form of the transfer matrix @xmath90 .",
    "the result is entirely based on the fact that asymptotic solutions which are composed of traveling phonon parts and exponentially growing or decaying parts far from the center of the breather can be connected to each other by a transfer matrix .",
    "therefore , the same procedure can be applied to the breather - phonon scattering problem in the nearest neighbor hamiltonian chain to obtain a similar proof@xcite .",
    "a major difference is that the number of channels in the latter case should be extended to infinity for each frequency component @xmath91 , in which @xmath28 is the phonon frequency and @xmath92 is the breather frequency , in the case of hamiltonian breather .",
    "the occurrence of the perfect reflection in the weak - coupling limit can be shown by a perturbation method . retaining only terms of order @xmath93",
    ", we obtain the transfer matrix @xmath94 ; other @xmath25 s are discarded because they affect only the phase factors in the order @xmath95 .",
    "the transmission coefficient thus obtained is @xmath96 in the weak - coupling limit .",
    "numerical calculation , which takes into account of several higher order terms of @xmath93 , agrees with the perturbative result as shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "perfect phonon reflection by breathers in the dnls equation is a property which persists for weak - coupling , in contrast to what happens in the hamiltonian nearest neighbor chain where the perfect reflection exist only for a positive interval of coupling strength @xmath4 for a given @xmath92 .    in the case of phonon scattering by a local equilibria kink in the nearest neighbor hamiltonian chain",
    ", there is no perfect reflection@xcite .",
    "however , there occurs a perfect reflection in the hamiltonian discrete breather@xcite .",
    "the critical difference between the case of a local equilibria kink and the case of hamiltonian or the dnls breathers is the minimum number of frequencies needed for describing linearized motion at each site . in the case of the local equilibria ,",
    "one fourier component measuring the deviation from the equilibrium at each site is sufficient to describe the motion of each site because the kink in the local equilibria is a time independent defect . on the other hand",
    ", the discrete breather in the hamiltonian system has an intrinsic time scale @xmath97 which is the period of the breather .",
    "the intrinsic frequency @xmath98 generates an infinite number of frequencies @xmath99 ( @xmath100 is an integer ) mixing with the phonon frequency @xmath28 by nonlinear terms in the equation . for the dnls case , only one more frequency",
    "is generated due to the complex conjugate operation in eq.([eq4 ] ) .    with the transfer matrix method",
    ", the transmission and reflection coefficients can be calculated numerically in the same way as in the case of the local equilibria@xcite .",
    "the transfer matrix , @xmath90 , is obtained numerically and the scattering coefficients are solved from eq.([eq13_5 ] ) .",
    "the number of sites in the scattering setup , @xmath29 , in eq.([eq13_5 ] ) is chosen to allow a decay of the amplitude of the breather within the error bound , @xmath101 , in our calculation . for @xmath102",
    ", @xmath29 needs not to exceed @xmath103 to maintain this bound . the phase diagram for the localized eigenmodes and the transmission for various values of @xmath4",
    "are obtained numerically in fig.[fig4 ] and fig.[fig5 ] . for small coupling , there is no perfect transmission .",
    "a perfect transmission is generated from @xmath81 at @xmath104 where a symmetric localized eigenmode@xcite is generated from the lower edge of the phonon band .",
    "the value of @xmath72 where the perfect transmission occurs increases from zero until it reaches a maximum value . then the maximal wave vector decreases and becomes zero again where another localized eigenmode , which is anti - symmetric at this time@xcite , is generated .",
    "these numerical results are consistent with predictions of the linear scattering analysis .",
    "the return of @xmath72 , where the perfect transmission occurs , to zero after its initial creation and deviation from zero is due to the multi - site spreading of the breather envelope . for a one - site breather ,",
    "if only @xmath105 is retained in calculating @xmath90 , the location of the perfect transmission does not return to @xmath81 again ; which is consistent with the fact that there is no generation of the anti - symmetric localized eigenmode .",
    "in other words , the generation of a perfect transmission and a symmetric localized eigenmode is due to the single - site defect property of the discrete breather , whereas the annihilation of the perfect transmission and the generation of an anti - symmetric localized eigenmode is due to the multi - site structure of the breather .",
    "the perfect reflection at nonzero @xmath72 is another special feature of the one - channel phonon scattering case .",
    "it is important because the breather can be regarded as a perfect reflecting barrier for the phonon , which opens the possibility of trapping phonons between two breathers .",
    "numerical results show that a perfect reflection occurs at a special value of @xmath72 if the coupling is not too strong . the value of @xmath72 where the perfect reflection occurs changes from @xmath106 to @xmath45 as @xmath4 increases .",
    "if @xmath4 reaches a critical value of @xmath107 , the perfect reflection disappears through @xmath81 as depicted in fig.[fig6 ] .",
    "in conclusion , phonon scattering by discrete breathers in the dnls equation is formulated by the transfer matrix method and transmissions were obtained in the one - channel scattering case .",
    "the nonzero transmission of phonons through the discrete breather at @xmath0 in the one - channel phonon scattering occurs at the localized eigenmode threshold is proven analytically to be perfect for the symmetric discrete breather .",
    "numerically , the perfect transmission was shown to occur at @xmath0 whenever the symmetric and antisymmetric localized eigenmodes were generated from the lower edge of the phonon band .",
    "we obtained explicitly the formula for the phonon transmission in the lowest order of the coupling strength .",
    "a perfect reflection was shown to exist at @xmath108 in the small coupling limit .",
    "the location of the perfect reflection was traced numerically until it disappeared through @xmath81 at a critical value of the coupling strength .",
    "the solution matching method using the transfer matrices has been proved to be an efficient tool for investigating scattering properties .",
    "furthermore , the dnls system provided a good intermediate example with two scattering channels bridging the gap between the case of a kink in the local equilibria with a single scattering channel and the discrete breather in the classical hamiltonian system with an infinity of scattering channels .",
    "the methods used for the breather in the dnls system can be extended to study the one - channel scattering of the nearest neighbor hamiltonian chain .",
    "the multi - channel scattering problem is important in the context of stability , e.g. , a two - channel scattering problem where the phonons of the second channel are incident from one side of the breather .",
