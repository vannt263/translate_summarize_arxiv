    "the structure and interactions of hadrons at intermediate energies represents one of the most outstanding problems in the standard model of particle and nuclear physics .",
    "many hadronic observables can be described at low energies in terms of effective , hadronic ( meson & baryon ) degrees of freedom , while at high energies perturbative qcd has proved a highly successful approach to describing phenomena in terms of elementary quark and gluon constituents .",
    "the precise nature of the transition between the two regimes has remained shrouded in mystery , however , and represents a fundamental challenge to our understanding of strong nuclear interactions within qcd .",
    "one of the most intriguing connections between the low and high energy realms is the phenomenon of quark - hadron duality , in which one finds in certain cases dual descriptions of observables in terms of either explicit quark degrees of freedom , or as averages over hadronic variables .",
    "a spectacular example of such a duality is in inclusive electron ",
    "nucleon scattering .",
    "first observed by bloom & gilman in the early days of deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) measurements @xcite , this duality manifests itself in the similarity of structure functions averaged over the resonance region ( which is characterized by hadronic bound states ) and the scaling or leading twist function describing the high energy , deep inelastic continuum ( characterized by scattering from free quarks ) @xcite .",
    "unraveling the origin of the `` bloom - gilman '' duality from first principles has proved to be a major challenge in qcd . until now the only rigorous connection with the fundamental theory has been within the operator product or `` twist '' expansion , in which moments of structure functions are expanded as a series in inverse powers of the virtuality @xmath1 of the exchanged photon .",
    "the leading , @xmath2 term is given by matrix elements of ( leading twist ) quark - gluon bilocal operators , and is associated with free quark scattering , while the @xmath3 and higher terms correspond to nonperturbative ( higher twist ) quark - gluon interactions .",
    "bloom - gilman duality is then interpreted in this language as the suppression of higher twist contributions to the moments @xcite .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite suggest that not only moments , but structure functions in individual resonance regions , such as the @xmath4 , @xmath5 or @xmath6 regions , closely resemble the leading twist structure functions over the same intervals .",
    "this indicates that duality also exists locally , in restricted regions of hadronic final state mass @xmath7 .",
    "the appearance of this _ local _ duality can not , however , be explained with the theoretical tools presently at our disposal , and insight into the workings of duality for individual resonance regions has been confined to qcd - inspired models of the nucleon . as such our understanding of quark - hadron duality in nucleon structure functions within qcd is incomplete .    in this paper",
    "we present a new approach to the study of local quark - hadron duality within a perturbative qcd context , using `` truncated '' moments of structure functions .",
    "the virtue of truncated moments is that they obey a similar set of @xmath1 evolution equations as those for parton distributions @xcite , which therefore enables a rigorous connection to be made between local duality and qcd .",
    "it allows us to quantify for the first time the higher twist content of various resonance regions , and determine the degree to which individual resonances are dominated by leading twist .",
    "truncated moments were introduced several years ago by forte _",
    "@xcite to study structure function moments for which small-@xmath0 data were not available . by restricting or truncating the integration region to some minimum value of the bjorken @xmath0 variable",
    ", one could avoid the problem of extrapolating parton distributions into unmeasured regions at small @xmath0 .",
    "later kotlorz & kotlorz @xcite developed an alternative formulation of the evolution equations which avoids the problem of mixing of higher truncated moments when evolving in @xmath1 .    in this work",
    "we partially follow the latter approach and apply it to the study of structure functions in the _",
    "large-@xmath0 _ region , populated by nucleon resonances . in particular , we study the @xmath1 evolution of structure functions integrated over specific nucleon resonance regions . to facilitate such an analysis",
    "requires extension of the definition of the truncated moments to include both upper and lower truncations .",
    "we show that these `` doubly truncated '' moments also obey the same @xmath1 evolution equations . using recent high - precision data on the proton @xmath8 structure function from jefferson lab and elsewhere ,",
    "we quantify the size of the higher twists for the lowest three moments in various regions of @xmath7 .",

    "( [ eq : fullmoment ] ) , the full moments are obtained by integrating the pdf over all values of the bjorken variable , @xmath26 .",
    "since @xmath0 is related to the invariant mass squared @xmath27 of the virtual photon ",

    "the truncated moments of a pdf @xmath10 are defined as : @xmath33 where the integration is restricted to @xmath34 ( the first two arguments in @xmath35 denote the lower and upper limits of the integration ) . from the evolution equation ( [ eq : evolutionequation ] )",
    ", one can verify that the truncated moments satisfy : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the truncated anomalous dimension .",
    "for @xmath38 , the latter reduces to the usual @xmath0-independent anomalous dimension , @xmath39 , which can be taken outside the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolutionequationtruncatedmoments2 ] ) .",
    "the right hand side then depends only on the @xmath20-th moment , and the full moments of pdfs evolve independently of each other .    for nonzero @xmath40 , the residual @xmath41 dependence in the truncated anomalous dimension leads to evolutions equations which are not diagonal in @xmath20 .",
    "this can be seen by expanding @xmath42 as a taylor series around @xmath43 , and truncating the expansion at a finite order @xmath44 .",
    "accordingly , eq .  ( [ eq : evolutionequationtruncatedmoments2 ] )",
    "then turns into a system of coupled evolution equations : @xmath45 where @xmath46    unlike the full moments , the evolution of the truncated moment of order @xmath20 is determined by all truncated moments of order @xmath47 , with @xmath48 .",
    "however , the series of couplings to higher moments converges , and can be truncated to any desired accuracy .",
    "one can solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : truncatedsum ] ) to arbitrarily high accuracy by using a sufficiently large basis of truncated moments .",
    "for example , the higher moments @xmath49 can be calculated with excellent accuracy even for a small @xmath50 number of terms in the expansion of the truncated anomalous dimension .",
    "the first moment , on the other hand , is more sensitive to the truncation point @xmath40 and the convergence of the truncated anomalous dimension for @xmath51 is weaker than for the higher moments .",
    "the evolution equations satisfied by the truncated moments can be formulated in an alternative way which avoids the problem of mixing of lower moments with higher moments @xcite .",
    "inverting the order of integration on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolutionequationtruncatedmoments2 ] ) and introducing a new variable @xmath52 , the integral can be written as : @xmath53 with @xmath54 the evolution equation for the truncated moments then becomes : @xmath55 which is very similar to the original evolution equation ( [ eq : evolutionequation ] ) for the pdfs .",
    "here @xmath56 plays the role of the splitting function for the truncated moments .",
    "the truncated moments therefore satisfy dglap evolution with a modified splitting function @xmath57 in the mellin convolution .",

    "( [ eq : evolutionequationtruncatedmoments3 ] ) .",
    "the central aim of this study is to determine the extent to which nucleon structure function data in specific regions in @xmath0 ( or @xmath7 ) are dominated by leading twist .",
