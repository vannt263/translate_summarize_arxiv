    "as is the case with dragons @xcite , everyone knows that rigid bodies do not exist .",
    "nonetheless , the study of the dynamics of rigid bodies can give valuable insights into the behavior of real compressible many - body systems .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a recent , broad account of this old , but still flourishing , subject .",
    "systems of hard spheres , interacting via steric repulsion , have also received a great deal of attention in simulating soft matter systems .",
    "the _ hard - sphere paradigm _ is the assumption that , to a good approximation , any simple liquid with strongly repulsive forces may be modeled as a system of hard spheres . typically , in the hard sphere paradigm , hard sphere particles have no rotational degrees of freedom , and move in straight lines with constant velocity until they collide elastically ; that is , by conserving linear momentum and kinetic energy",
    ". a current review is provided in ref .",
    "by contrast , the dynamics of systems of non - spherical hard particles have received far less attention .",
    "the dynamics of non - spherical particles has been addressed in a recent work @xcite , extending the theory of the boltzmann equation from hard spheres to general hard particles . in ref .  @xcite it is suggested that it may not always be possible to construct a family of scattering matrices corresponding to the collision of two non - spherical particles which conserves their total linear momentum , angular momentum and kinetic energy",
    "; that is , the dynamics of non - spherical hard particles may not be fully compatible with the conservation laws of classical mechanics .",
    "the specific concern was that the dynamics prescribed by the conservation laws could , in rare instances , result in the interpenetration of the colliding bodies .    paradoxes in the impact dynamics of rigid bodies have been known to exist for a long time .",
    "the classical balance laws of mechanics are not sufficient to solve the problem of impact between two rigid bodies , that is , to predict the motion of two colliding bodies after the impact , once their motion before impact is known .",
    "the classical balance laws must be supplemented by an additional _ impact _ ( or _ collision _ ) law , which is constitutive in nature and must ultimately be justified ( or at least confirmed ) experimentally . as lucidly explained in chapter 4 of brogliato : nonsmooth , impact laws fall into three broad categories .",
    "they all relate mechanical properties of the colliding bodies before and after impact .",
    "what distinguishes the three categories is the nature of these properties : they may relate velocities , impulses , or kinetic energies .",
    "while the first two categories are classical , having already been introduced in the works of newton and poisson ( see also @xcite ) , the third category is rather more recent in its inception : it was introduced by stronge  @xcite to overcome paradoxes that arise in the presence of friction @xcite .",
    "these paradoxes showed instances in which newton s law of impact would imply an energy gain .",
    "however , as also remarked in @xcite , for _ smooth _ ( frictionless ) rigid bodies all three categories are equivalent and reduce to one and the same prescription , which is consistent with the conservation of linear momentum , angular momentum , and kinetic energy .",
    "the known paradoxes of impact dynamics simply evaporate as friction is neglected .    in this paper , we examine collisions of smooth , strictly - convex hard particles , and conclude that although these almost always satisfy the conservation laws without interpenetration , there may occur rare events where , remarkably , this is not the case . we conclude therefore that the dynamics of non - spherical strictly - convex hard particles in 3d are , in general , _ not _ consistent with the conservation laws of classical mechanics .",
    "alternatively , we could say that enforcing momentum conservation and rigidity in the instances shown here would violate energy conservation .",
    "this is the new paradox described in this paper .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section @xmath0 on conservation laws establishes the connection between momentum transfer and the motion of rigid bodies .",
    "section @xmath1 is divided into two parts .",
    "the first part , @xmath2 , outlines how the surfaces of the colliding bodies are characterized , and how the distances between them are measured .",
    "the points neighboring the point of contact play an important role , and their relevant kinematics is described .",
    "the second part , @xmath3 , identifies specific collision scenarios , and classifies their behavior .",
    "the main result of the paper , the inconsistency of rigid body dynamics and the conservation laws of classical mechanics is demonstrated .",
    "section @xmath4 summarizes our results .",
    "the paper is accompanied by a supplementary data file .",
    "in particular , supplementary data iii provides a detailed derivation of the equations of motion used in the main body of the paper .",
    "supplementary data i gives details of a numerical example of a collision illustrating the inconsistency .",
    "in this section , we consider the frictionless collisions of particles which are strictly - convex rigid bodies of arbitrary but smooth shape .",
    "we assume that the closed bounding surfaces of the bodies are sufficiently smooth to allow all partial derivatives up to second order to be well defined at each point on the surface .",
    "we examine how two arbitrary but strictly - convex rigid bodies , particle @xmath5 and particle @xmath0 , change their momenta upon collision .",
    "a collision is an event when particles interact and may exchange momentum .",
    "we consider collisions where the particles are well separated before collision , and , following their trajectories of motion , come into single point contact and can interact with each other .",
    "the interaction is via a hard core interaction potential , which is positive infinite if the particles interpenetrate , and is zero otherwise . since the particle energies are finite , interpenetration of a rigid body by another , where two particles have more than one point in common , is not possible .",
    "thus , a collision is an event when two particles , which were well separated before , are in single point contact externally .",
    "since the forces the particles exert on each other are gradients of the potential , if forces are exerted , their magnitude is infinite .",
    "since the momenta and kinetic energies are finite , collisions are necessarily instantaneous .    in elastic collisions , linear and angular momenta and kinetic energy may be exchanged , but must be conserved . unlike compressible bodies ,",
    "rigid body systems have no mechanism for dissipation , and since there is no ( finite ) nonzero potential energy , kinetic energy must be conserved .",
    "we assume that the bodies are frictionless ; that is , the direction of the exchanged linear momentum is along the common normal to the two surfaces at the point of contact .",
    "if the impulse acting on body @xmath5 is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnitude of the impulse and @xmath8 is the unit outward normal at the surface of body @xmath5 at the point of contact , then the conservation of linear momentum gives@xmath9where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the masses of bodies @xmath5 and @xmath0 with centers of mass at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the pre - collision and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the post - collision velocities of the centers of mass .",
    "the bodies move freely in space : in the absence of collisions , linear momentum is unchanged , and the center of mass of each body moves with constant velocity .",
    "conservation of angular momentum gives @xmath18where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the moment of inertia tensors of bodies @xmath5 and @xmath0 about their centers of mass , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are pre - collision and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are post - collision angular velocities .",
    "the vector @xmath25 is a body - fixed vector from the center of mass of body @xmath5 to the point in body @xmath5 which is the contact point at the instant of collision , and @xmath26 is a body - fixed vector from center of mass of body @xmath0 to the point in body @xmath0 which is the contact point at the instant of collision .",
    "( we shall refer to the points at the tips of the vectors @xmath27 and @xmath26 in general as contact points , even though they are only in contact with each other at the instant of collision . )",
    "we note that in the absence of collisions , angular momentum about the center of mass is unchanged , however , since in general the moment of inertia is changing due to rotation , the angular velocity also changes in time .",
    "the angular acceleration in the lab frame is @xmath28 in accordance with euler s equations @xcite .",
    "finally , the conservation of kinetic energy requires that@xmath29    we note that @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the pre - collision and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the post - collision velocities of the contact points on bodies @xmath5 and @xmath0 . solving for @xmath7 , we find two solutions .",
    "one solution is @xmath34 , corresponding to no momentum or energy transfer .",
    "the second solution is given by@xmath35where@xmath36and @xmath37 is the identity tensor * * , * * where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are vectors , and @xmath40 is a tensor , is a tensor with cartesian components @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the levi - civita symbol . ] .",
    "the cross - products are of the vectors and the eigenvectors of the tensors in their canonical form .",
    "( [ alp ] ) implies that the magnitude of the impulse , and of the exchanged momenta , is proportional to the normal velocity of approach of the contact points .",
    "the velocity of separation is given by@xmath43 .\\]]it follows at once that @xmath44 in agreement with @xcite .",
    "that is , the post - collision speed of separation of the contact points along the normal is equal to their pre - collision speed of approach along the normal .",
    "this result is essential to our arguments below .",
    "we note that if the collision were not instantaneous , then during the collision the speed of separation would , for some instances of time , differ from the final speed of separation .",
    "this would clearly violate energy conservation , since , unlike in the case of interactions via a soft potential , energy can not be stored as potential energy .",
    "rigid body collisions must , again , therefore be instantaneous .",
    "in what follows , we distinguish between two types of collisions .",
    "in the first type , which we call ` normal ' collisions , the particles approach each other with a non - zero normal velocity of approach of the contact points ; here we note that @xmath45 . in this case",
    ", there is instantaneous momentum transfer , with the magnitude indicated in eq .",
    "( alp ) , and , in general , there is also energy transfer between the particles .    in the second , which we call ` tangential ' collisions ,",
    "the contact points approach each other along the tangent to the surfaces at the points of contact , and in this way come into contact with each other . here",
    "@xmath34 , and in this case , there is neither momentum nor energy transfer .",
    "here we consider the motion of the points of contact on the colliding bodies , as well as of the points in the vicinity of the points of contact before and after collisions .",
    "we are interested in the compatibility of particle motion with the conservation laws ; we are particularly interested in the separation and possible interpenetration of the two colliding particles .    a convenient way to describe the closed surface of a body is by a scalar function @xmath46 , such that , if @xmath47 is the position vector of a point on the surface of the body at time @xmath48 , then @xmath49the time @xmath48 appears explicitly in the argument list to indicate that the position and orientation of the body are , in general , changing in time .",
    "if @xmath50is the outward pointing unit normal , then @xmath51 indicates that the point designated by @xmath52 is inside the body , while @xmath53 indicates that it is outside .",
    "we now inquire whether an arbitrary point @xmath54 on the surface of particle @xmath0 at time @xmath48 is inside , outside or on the surface , described by @xmath55 of particle @xmath5 .    as we are probing collision kinematics , we are primarily interested in the relative locations of the points of contact , but we are also interested in the locations of material points on the surface in the neighborhood of the contact points just before , at , and just after the collision .",
    "due to convexity , more distant points on the surface are also more distant from the tangent plane at the point of contact , hence we do not consider them here .    except perhaps at the instant of collision , particles @xmath5 and @xmath0 are moving in space according to their force and torque - free equations of motion ; that is , with constant linear and angular momenta , conserving kinetic energy .",
    "their constants of motion , before and after the collision , are determined by initial conditions .",
    "we refer to the points of contact at collision as point @xmath56 on body @xmath5 , and point @xmath57 on body @xmath0 .",
    "the position vector of @xmath58 is given by@xmath59 similarly , the position vector of @xmath57 is given by@xmath60 we introduce the body fixed small vector @xmath61 , from the point @xmath57 to a neighboring point on particle @xmath0 .",
    "we constrain @xmath62 to be small by requiring that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the maximum curvature at the point of contact .",
    "the position vector of this point is @xmath65we indicate the position of a point on the surface of particle @xmath0 in the vicinity of @xmath57 by the ` @xmath66 ' sign on the subscript of @xmath67 .",
    "it is useful to write @xmath68 as @xmath69where @xmath70 is the outward unit normal to particle @xmath0 at @xmath57 , @xmath71 due to convexity , @xmath72 is perpendicular to @xmath70 , and @xmath73 as shown in supplementary data ii .",
    "as the bodies move , points on the surfaces of the two bodies change their positions in space .",
    "the position @xmath47 of an arbitrary point on the surface of a body can be expanded in taylor series about @xmath74 to give @xmath75where @xmath76 , @xmath38 and @xmath77 are the velocity , acceleration and jerk .",
    "explicit expressions for these in the free motion of rigid bodies are given in supplementary data iii .",
    "to determine if a point on the surface of particle @xmath0 with position vector @xmath78 has penetrated particle @xmath5 , we evaluate @xmath79 and check its sign .",
    "it is useful to choose a specific form for @xmath80 .",
    "the surface of a smooth convex body in the vicinity of a point on the surface can be well described by the normal to the surface , and the two principal curvatures , and the associated directions in the tangent plane .",
    "we choose therefore @xmath81 such that , in the vicinity of the point @xmath82 , one has @xmath83\\cdot ( % \\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_{p}),\\]]where @xmath84 is the outward unit normal , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , both strictly positive , are the principal curvatures , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the corresponding eigenvectors . the hessian is@xmath89and so @xmath90the function @xmath91 measures a signed distance between the point designated by @xmath47 and the surface of body @xmath5 .",
    "to indicate points in the vicinity of the point @xmath57 at the time of collision , we write @xmath92where @xmath93we then have@xmath94to study the approach and separation of the colliding particles , we evaluate @xmath95 as a function of time .",
    "the collision occurs at time @xmath74 ; hence we expand @xmath96 in taylor series about @xmath74 : @xmath97    substitution gives@xmath98and we note that all quantities on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) are evaluated at @xmath74 . in the case of normal collisions , the velocities @xmath99 and @xmath100 as well as the angular velocities @xmath101 and @xmath102 change instantaneously at the instant of collision .",

    "the velocities @xmath105 and @xmath100 and the angular velocities @xmath106 and @xmath102 do not change , and the distinction is not required .",
    "we next write the expression for @xmath107 in standard form,@xmath108where @xmath109refers to the position of a neighbor point of point @xmath57 , defined by @xmath110 relative to body @xmath5 , measured from the point @xmath58 .",

    "there are two types of collisions : the usual normal collisions , and the rare tangential collisions .    in the case of normal collisions ,",
    "when the approaching velocity of two contact points has a non - vanishing component along the normal to the surface at the point of contact , then there is momentum transfer between the two bodies , and the contact points separate immediately after the collision .",

    "we conclude therefore that the dynamics of strictly - convex rigid bodies is not fully consistent with the conservation laws of classical mechanics .",
    "specifically , the inconsistency means that the conservation laws ( conservation of linear and angular momentum , and of energy ) and rigidity ( with necessarily instantaneous collisions with infinite force and only kinetic energy ) can not hold simultaneously in all collisions .",
    "we have enforced the conservation laws in our approach , and observed that on rare occasions rigidity is violated .",
    "alternatively , we could have enforced momentum conservation and rigidity , and could have shown that , on rare occasions , energy conservation is violated , thus making our paradox for smooth rigid bodies akin to those already known for rough rigid bodies .",
    "the physical origins of the inconsistency are associated with the unrealistic hard interaction , which prevents the ( temporary ) storage of energy in the interaction potential . in the rare case considered here , where jerk dominates",
    ", the contact points behave as though they experience time dependent force which is linear in time , leading to zero speed and acceleration but nonzero jerk at @xmath74 , followed by motion with acceleration in the same direction . in such a situation",
    ", a soft body would respond by gradually deforming after the collision , and temporarily storing / dissipating energy in the deformation as a function of time .",
    "this behavior is disallowed for rigid bodies , where kinetic energy alone must be conserved .    for non - convex rigid bodies",
    ", the collision dynamics would be much more complicated and we have not considered it here .    in conclusion , we have presented a new paradox : in extremely rare cases , the dynamics of smooth , nonspherical convex rigid bodies in 3d is not consistent with the conservation laws of classical mechanics .    * acknowledgement * _ p.p .- m . and x.z .",
