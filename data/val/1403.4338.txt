    "in summary , we have proposed a tunneling - assisted soc in bilayer becs .",
    "this scheme can be realized in a straightforward manner by coupling the individual raman transition induced 1d soc through the inter - layer laser - assisted tunneling .",
    "due to an interplay between the inter - layer tunneling , intra - layer soc and atomic interactions , the ground states display a diverse phase diagram .",
    "it is demonstrated that a new type of stripe phase which breaks the tr symmetry and a fractionalized skyrmion lattice emerge spontaneously in the ground states .",
