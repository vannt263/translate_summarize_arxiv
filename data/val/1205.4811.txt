    "understanding the complex features of various dynamical systems in the real world continues to be a crucial challenge across the physical and natural sciences . to better understand such complicated interactions it is useful to first transform the system into a new frame of reference .",
    "this is the approach we follow here . in this paper , we describe a method to transform a linear model built from a time series representing a ( possibly nonlinear , possibly stochastic ) dynamical system into a network which is capable of representing the time structure of the model to explore undiscovered structure of the original dynamical system .",
    "this method enables us to investigate the dynamics of the time series from a network perspective and allows us to explore the globally interrelated structure and the hierarchy .",
    "the network transformation provides us with a new representation of a generic model of the original dynamics . by examining the topology of the network ,",
    "we can directly obtain better understanding of the structure and the characteristics of the phenomenon represented by the time series modeling .",
    "connectivity between different features of the deterministic model structure can now be understood in greater detail than before thanks to this new toolbox from complex network theory .    over the past decade",
    "it has become clear that networks as typified by `` complex networks '' have a vast range of applicability and give a new perspective on various problems in the real world  @xcite . in particular , there have been several recent works to combine time series with networks , such as networks through the correlation strength  @xcite , recurrence networks  @xcite , cycle networks for pseudo - periodic time series  @xcite and the horizontal visibility algorithm  @xcite .",
    "these approaches are proven to be effective in understanding complicated and entangled structure of systems  .",
    "however , these works still do not address one essential ingredient .",
    "although systems in the real world have various different time delay or feedback effects in principle , such effects , which we refer to as `` time structure , '' can not be directly treated or set in the network by current approaches .",
    "furthermore , the network structures from time series in the existing approaches may not always be sufficient to capture the salient features of the underlying global interrelation structure , because these structures are essentially built on local information such as the temporal structures on an embedding space and correlations ( similarities ) between each pair of time series among many  @xcite .",
    "in addition , `` no similarity '' is not equivalent to `` no correlation . '' even when two signals are not similar , these systems can still have some kind of correlated structures . under these circumstances , it is crucial to find a method to translate directly the features of dynamics into network topology .    in this paper , to unravel entangled deterministic dynamical structures , we propose a method of constructing a network based on deterministic model structure from a given time series .",
    "time structure is directly set in the network and the network fully reflects the global structure of interrelation and the hierarchy of the components of the model .",
    "this is the first attempt to represent a generic deterministic model as a network in order to understand the deterministic dynamics of observed data with its time structure fully incorporated .",
    "it is usually difficult to extract the hidden or underlying nature of the structure of a given complicated time dependent phenomenon by directly examining it .",
    "however , it is relatively easy to obtain a time series data and build a model from the data . in principle",
    ", we can expect that the time series model reflects underlying features of the time series such as entangled time structures in varying degrees and therefore the model can be a good starting point for unravelling the time structure of the system .",
    "it should be emphasized that the method for transforming the time series model into network topology presented in this paper offers an approach completely different from existing ones to clearly visualise the hidden time structure of the system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : algorithm ] , the network construction algorithm from a given time series proposed in this paper is described . to demonstrate a concrete example of this algorithm ,",
    "it is applied to a simple `` toy model '' in section  [ sec : numerical example ] .",
    "the effectiveness of the algorithm is shown in section  [ sec : application ] , where the method is applied to two actual time series : annual sunspot numbers and a microtremor data set from an earthquake .",
    "we summarise the results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "to construct networks with time structure , we have to find the underlying time delays in time series as necessary elements and translate them into a network for visualization .",
    "an effective first step is the time series modelling  . to obtain the precise interrelation of terms with time delays or the essential linear structures included in time series",
    ", we use an information theoretic reduction of linear models , the reduced autoregressive  ( rar ) model  @xcite . unlike a standard ar model ,",
    "rar models include only terms that contribute significantly to the model , as assessed by an information criterion .",
    "a standard ar model is built up from terms with unit time delay , though some terms ( some time delays ) might not be necessary to capture the essential feature of phenomena .",
    "in contrast , rar models include only terms that contribute significantly to the model as assessed by an information criterion .",
    "the rar model has proven to be effective in modelling both linear and nonlinear dynamics  @xcite , and this model provides a generic method to locally linearize the system under consideration in a way which would be applicable to any smooth vector field , even though the underlying system is not linear .",
    "more details about rar models can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the method described in this paper is composed of two steps : ( i )  building an rar model from a given time series and ( ii )  constructing a network from the model .",
    "we first give a brief review of the rar model .    given a time series @xmath0 of @xmath1 observations , an rar model with the largest time delay  @xmath2 can be expressed by @xmath3 where @xmath4 are unknown parameters , and @xmath5 is assumed to be independent and identically distributed gaussian random variables , which are interpreted as a fitting error . the parameters  @xmath6 are chosen to minimize the sum of squares of the fitting errors .",
    "among various information criteria used to find the best ( optimal ) model  @xcite , we employ the schwartz information criterion  ( sic )  @xcite .",
    "the sic formula is defined by @xmath7 where @xmath1 is the number of data points , @xmath8 is the model size and @xmath9 is the fitting errors .    in building rar models , we need to select necessary terms .",
    "firstly , many candidate basis functions are prepared in the form of a dictionary .",
    "next we select as many basis functions that can extract the peculiarity of the time series as possible according to various model selection methods  @xcite .",
    "all of these model selection methods have a common difficulty , which is to identify the globally optimal model , due to trapping into local minima  @xcite . for finding the truly optimal model ,",
    "all possible combinations of basis functions have to be calculated ( an exhaustive search ) . although an exhaustive search for a dictionary smaller than approximately 30 is usually manageable , the calculation for a large dictionary costs enormous computational time and is unrealistic , as performing an exhaustive search is expected to be an np - hard problem  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted , however , that we can always resort to other methods for approximately finding the global minimum  @xcite , when exhaustive search is computationally impossible .",
    "the models obtained by selection algorithms are nearly optimal . to avoid this complexity caused by near optimality",
    ", we use exhaustive search in this paper in finding the optimal model that gives the minimum value of sic  @xcite . for verification",
    ", we also investigated the network structure of nearly optimal models and found that the core structure of the network built up from the optimal model is preserved in these nearly optimal models apart from the other `` leaf '' nodes around the core structure .      after obtaining a model representing the time series under consideration",
    ", we transform the model into a directed network ( i )  by representing each term  @xmath10 at time  @xmath11 in the model by a node labelled by the time and ( ii )  by drawing an arrow directed from a node  @xmath12 to the node  @xmath10 , where the time delay term @xmath12 appears in the rar model for the expression of @xmath10 .",
    "this arrow represents the influence of @xmath12 on @xmath10 with time delay  @xmath13 .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that a large absolute value of the parameter @xmath6 represents the large influence of @xmath12 on @xmath10 .",
    "we treat the influence as a `` distance '' between nodes  @xmath10 and @xmath12 using @xmath6 on the network space ; the larger the absolute value of @xmath6 , the shorter the distance between @xmath10 and @xmath12 . since there have been no previous attempts to translate the values of the parameters into the network space , we introduce the following simple distance based on elementary linear algebra .",
    "we should mention the constant parameter  @xmath14 and dynamical noise  @xmath5 in the rar model .",
    "they surely play important roles in actual dynamics and both of them should be included in constructing a model .",
    "however , these terms contain no time information .",
    "since our purpose is to unravel entangled time structure of deterministic dynamics , we do not take them into account in defining the distance between terms with time delay in constructing a network .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rar ] ) can be interpreted as a linear combination of the set of linearly independent `` unit vectors , '' @xmath15 , with the coefficients , @xmath16 . by this interpretation",
    ", we introduce the `` angle ''  @xmath17 between the directions of @xmath10 and @xmath18 as @xmath19 the distance we introduce should have following properties .",
    "firstly , when vectors  @xmath10 and @xmath12 are in the same direction , the angle @xmath17 becomes @xmath20 and the distance  @xmath21 should be @xmath22 .",
    "we expect the analyticity of the `` distance '' around @xmath23 and put @xmath24 in this case . secondly , when the vectors @xmath10 and @xmath12 are perpendicular ( @xmath25 ) , the angle  @xmath17 becomes @xmath26 and the distance  @xmath21 should be infinity",
    ". thus @xmath21 should be inversely proportional to @xmath27 .",
    "finally , the distance must always be a positive real number .",
    "regarding all these requirements , we define the distance  @xmath21 between the nodes @xmath10 and @xmath12 as @xmath28 we consider that the concept of `` distance '' introduced here depends on the nature of the system , and other distances such as the inverse of the parameters may be justified in some situations .",
    "however , we consider that this distance is appropriate for most cases of linear models , because it reflects the overall balance of the size of parameters in the model .",
    "note that the proposed method is independent of the definition of the distance .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rar ] ) , the nodes contained in a model are directly connected to @xmath10 .",
    "the distance calculated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : distance ] ) is referred to as the direct distance  ( _ dd _ ) .",
    "a pair of nodes , however , can be connected indirectly via some other nodes .",
    "the sum of all distances through the path between these two nodes is referred to as the indirect distance ( _ i d _ ) . in a network",
    "we sometimes find a path with a shorter _ i d _ than the _",
    "dd_. in such a case , we can consider that the indirect path that gives the shortest length is the path on which the information is passed through most effectively and that these two nodes are essentially connected through the shortest _",
    "i d _ path .",
    "we therefore treat the collection of the paths that have the shortest length for any given node pairs as the network of the system .",
    "the network constructed in this way reveals the underlying hierarchical structure of the linear model and enables us to know whether the influence of a term may come through other terms .",
    "we demonstrate the application of our algorithm and confirm our theoretical argument with a simple example .",
    "we begin by the following ( artificial ) rar model : @xmath29    from the definitions of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : angle ] ) and ( [ eq : distance ] ) , we obtain the direct distances ( _ dd_s ) between the nodes as @xmath30 . in fig .  [",

    "( [ eq : simple example ] ) , where the numbers on the nodes are @xmath11 of @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : simple example ] ) .",
    "the first six nodes represented by squares are the initial nodes .",
    "the numbers on the arrows are the direct distances between nodes .",
    "the positions of the nodes are irrelevant ( only the topology is important ) and the length of the arrows also does not represent the actual scale . from this figure , we can clearly see that there are cases where an indirect distance between a pair of nodes is much shorter than the direct distance .",
    "for example , the indirect distance between node @xmath32 and @xmath31 via node @xmath33 is @xmath34 , while their direct distance is @xmath35.,width=302 ]    the distance between nodes represents the magnitude of influence from the other nodes .",
    "according to the model , the nodes  @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are directly connected with the node @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the nodes @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are directly connected with the node @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig : network for simple example ] . as mentioned in the previous section , however , the _ dd _ is not always the shortest .",
    "for example , the optimal  ( shortest ) path from @xmath32 to @xmath31 is the one via @xmath33 , while the last node  @xmath31 is directly connected with @xmath32 as fig .",
    "[ fig : network for simple example ] shows .",
    "since both of the _ dd_s from @xmath32 to @xmath33 and from @xmath33 to @xmath31 are 1.67 , the _ i d _ from @xmath32 to @xmath31 is the summation , @xmath34 , which is much shorter than the _ dd _ from @xmath32 to @xmath31 , @xmath35 , we can thus conclude that the most significant influence of the term @xmath38 to @xmath10 is not the direct one but that comes through the term @xmath37 .    ) .",
    "the nodes shown are from @xmath10 to the one with the largest time delay , @xmath38 .",
    "note that the node @xmath38 is not directly connected to @xmath10 but connected through @xmath37 .",
    "the gray colour corresponds to terms included in the model and the white colour to terms within the largest time delay but not included in the model , respectively .",
    "the numbers on the arrows are the direct distances between the nodes .",
    "we show all terms within the largest time delay to show the flow of time in the model without gaps and the structure more clearly.,width=264 ]    to show this situation more clearly , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mst network for simple example ] the set of most optimal paths to node @xmath10 from the nodes within the model ( between @xmath10 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : mst network for simple example ] shows that the node @xmath10 is directly connected with @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and the connection from @xmath38 is indirect via @xmath37 .",
    "this is an outcome of the interplay between the sizes of the parameters caused by the interrelation and hierarchy between terms of the model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : simple example ] ) . in this way",
    ", the network topology constructed by the present method reveals the time structure .",
    "note that we can not extract this information by simply examining eq .",
    "( [ eq : simple example ] ) .",
    "this is the manifestation of the underlying structure of dynamical systems through the network representation .",
    "based on the result of these computational studies , we apply the proposed method to two real world data : ( i )  annual sunspot numbers and ( ii )  microtremor data .",
    "we first apply the proposed method to annual sunspot numbers from year 1700 to 2008 , and the model is built with time delays up to 15  @xcite .",
    "( see fig .",

    "the obtained rar model is @xmath43 three time delay terms @xmath36 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are selected . and each direct distance to the node  @xmath10 is @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : sunspot_network ] shows that the optimal path network of the nodes from @xmath10 to @xmath45 has a simple chain structure .",
    "this result indicates that the fundamental mechanism of the oscillation of annual sunspot numbers is simple and the previous sunspot numbers influence the next numbers in series . from this result",
    "we can see the correspondence between the periodicities and the chain structure of the annual sunspot numbers .    ) , for the annual sunspot numbers .",
    "the nodes are from @xmath10 to the largest time delay @xmath45 in the model . for the explanation of notations used in this figure , see fig .",
    "( [ fig : mst network for simple example]).,width=302 ]      we next apply the proposed method to microtremor data , which shows rather non - trivial results .",
    "these data were taken from the east - west components of the ground velocity signal of the 1982 urakawa - oki ( hokkaido , japan ) earthquake @xcite .",
    "the data was measured at 50  hz and consists of 2600 data points in total .    to demonstrate how the network structure changes in the course of time development of the oscillation , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : earthquake_data ] the network structures corresponding to three different time regions in this microtremor data .",
    "three models are built with time delays up to 15  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted again that , for the calculation of the direct distances to the node @xmath10 , we do not use the constant parameter in the obtained model and dynamic noise .    .",
    "note that the positions of the nodes are irrelevant . , width=377 ]    for the time region  ( a ) , the obtained rar model has one constant parameter and eight time delay terms , @xmath49 we obtain the following eight direct distances to the node @xmath10 corresponding to each term : @xmath50 .",
    "the network for the time region  ( a ) in fig .  [ fig : earthquake_data ] shows that while the nodes @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are directly connected to the node  @xmath10 , the nodes @xmath38 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are not .",
    "the network also indicates another interesting feature of this model .",
    "the region  ( a ) in fig .",
    "( [ fig : earthquake_data ] ) implies that this network structure contains seemingly two `` hubs , '' nodes @xmath10 and @xmath56 , because other nodes flock to them .",
    "two chains of nodes separated by the shortest distance , @xmath57 , with time delay 4 can be found , the one of which connects nodes @xmath10 , @xmath56 and @xmath55 and the other of which connects nodes @xmath58 and @xmath45 .",
    "we can thus consider from this information that time delay  4 is a major period of this oscillation .",
    "we consider that time delays 1 and 3 also play significant roles that can not be ignored , because we can find several chains of nodes with time delay 1 and 3 . for time delay  1 , there are the chain of nodes @xmath10 , @xmath36 and @xmath44 and the chain of nodes @xmath56 and @xmath58 . for time delay  3 , there are the chain of nodes@xmath37 and @xmath38 and the chain of nodes@xmath54 and @xmath59 .",
    "it is highly probable that a hub structure appears when an oscillation consists of a main oscillation , where each unit oscillation is furthermore affected by other underlying oscillations with shorter time scales than the main oscillation period .",
    "as the absolute parameter value of the term @xmath56 is the largest in the model , one may think that the time difference 4 is the main period and that the nodes @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be `` hubs . ''",
    "it is not straightforward , however , to know the significance of time delays 1 and 3 by simply examining the model , eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_wave ] ) .",
    "the rar model for the time region  ( b ) is @xmath62 the direct distances to the node @xmath10 are @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "the rar model for the time region  ( c ) is @xmath64 the direct distances to the node @xmath10 are @xmath65 , respectively . from figs .",
    "[ fig : earthquake_data ]  ( a)-(c ) , we notice that the network structure develops from a star - like structure containing hubs to a relatively simple chain structure during the course of oscillation .",
    "a chain structure implies that the oscillation at present time is affected by a previous unit oscillation in a simple manner . in this way",
    ", our network construction method exhibits the transition in the nature of time series through network structure in addition to the detailed hierarchical relationship between terms in the model .",
    "one may think that simple visual inspection of the oscillation profile is sufficient for identifying three regions  ( a)-(c ) .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that the simple visual inspection can not reveal the structural differences in the nature of oscillation in these regions .",
    "in this paper , we described an algorithm to construct networks with time structure based on deterministic model structure from time series . in this algorithm a linear model containing various terms of different time delays is transformed into network topology .",
    "the advantage of this method over the existing ones is that the global structure of the relationship between terms in a time series model is directly translated to the topology of the corresponding network . by extracting the optimal paths for the constructed network , we can find the global structure and hierarchy between terms .",
    "the transition in the nature of time dependency is represented by the transformation in the structure of constructed networks . using this correspondence between the nature of oscillation and the structure of the network",
    ", we could compare and categorize different model realizations .",
    "in addition , networks constructed by the proposed method consists of temporal nodes .",
    "it should be emphasized that the insight into the transition in the nature of oscillation through network structure described in this paper can only be gained by network representation of time series with temporal nodes . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "networks with temporal nodes are not well studied and there remains many problems unsolved .",
    "our arguments and computational examples show the effectiveness of introducing networks with time structure and that the proposed method has a wide range of applicability and provides us profound insights in investigating time dependent phenomena .",
    "the effectiveness and the usefulness of the basic idea presented here should be verified and enlarged by future works . at present , we have two following problems .",
    "one is to treat nonlinearity more appropriately and naturally .",
    "this requires to find a proper method for translating nonlinear basis functions into network topology .",
    "the other is to treat multivariate time series data .",
    "though we present our method by univariate time series data in this paper , systems in the real world are not always isolated from their surroundings .",
    "each factor or element in those systems is interconnected or interrelated in some way or another to varying degrees .",
    "hence , it is important to extend our method to be applicable to multivariate data .",
