    "the origin of cosmic rays ( crs ) is a longstanding problem in astrophysics .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) are thought to be the origin of galactic cr nuclei and electrons .",
    "the most popular snr acceleration mechanism is the diffusive shock acceleration @xcite .",
    "in fact , _ fermi _ and _ agile _ show that middle - aged snrs interacting with molecular clouds emit gev gamma rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the origin of the gev gamma rays can be interpreted as the decay of neutral pions produced by cr nuclei ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , x - ray observations provide an evidence that electrons are accelerated to highly relativistic energies in snr shocks @xcite .",
    "snrs have been also observed by ground - based cherenkov telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is still unclear whether the origin of tev gamma rays is inverse compton scattering by cr electrons or the decay of neutral pions produced by inelastic collisions between cr protons and ambient thermal nuclei .",
    "in addition , there are many unidentified very - high - energy gamma - ray sources in our galaxy , and their emission mechanism is also still unclear .",
    "escape of cr nuclei from snrs has been investigated by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and emission from runaway cr nuclei has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "runaway cr nuclei can emit gamma rays from the exterior of accelerators and its radiation spectrum is softer than that from the interior because of energy - dependent diffusion of crs @xcite .",
    "the escape process of crs from accelerators is important because it changes the cr spectrum .",
    "the runaway cr spectrum depends not only on the cr spectrum at accelerators but also on the evolution of the maximum energy and the evolution of the number of accelerated crs @xcite .",
    "in addition , considering the escape effect , one can explain the spectral difference between cr protons and helium observed by cream @xcite .    however , the same processes for cr electrons suffering cooling effects have never been investigated so far . cooling processes via synchrotron radiation and inverse compton scattering are important for cr electrons because their cooling times can be smaller than other characteristic timescales .",
    "therefore , it is unclear whether cr electrons can escape from snrs or not , and whether the electron cooling affects the spectrum of runaway crs electrons or not , as in the energy spectrum of cr electrons inside the snrs .",
    "runaway cr electrons can produce gamma rays outside accelerators . in the low density region , these gamma rays probably dominate over those from runaway cr nuclei and may be observed as unidentified very - high - energy gamma - ray sources .",
    "this is because cr nuclei can not produce sufficient gamma rays there electrons can always produce enough gamma rays via inverse compton scattering of cmb photons ( see equation ( 7 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , distant snrs can not be easily identified by radio observations because of brighter emission from molecular clouds than synchrotron radiation .",
    "direct measurements of the cr electron spectrum may also bring us important information on escape of cr electrons .",
    "so far , _ fermi _ , h.e.s.s . and",

    "moreover , @xcite have pointed out that escape of cr electrons can be investigated by future observations of cr electrons , in particular , with a low - energy spectral cutoff .    in this paper , we investigate escape of cr electrons from an snr . our stance in this paper is that because the evolution of the magnetic field has not been understood theoretically , we predict observable quantities by using phenomenological approaches and restrict the phenomenological models by comparing the predicted values and observations . assuming the evolution of the maximum energy of cr protons ( hereafter we treat nuclei as protons ) during the sedov phase @xcite",
    ", we obtain the evolution of the diffusion coefficient , the magnetic field , and the maximum energy limited by synchrotron cooling ( section [ sec:2 ] ) .",
    "we calculate spatial distributions of runaway cr electrons around the snr ( section [ sec:3 ] ) , and radiation spectra from runaway cr electrons ( section [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss our results ( section [ sec:5 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , in order to understand essential features of escape of cr electrons , we assume simple evolutions of the shock radius , @xmath5 , and the shock velocity , @xmath6 , as in the following forms : @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the snr age , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the snr shock radius and the snr age at the beginning of the sedov phase , respectively ( see table  [ table1 ] for summary ) .",
    "the sedov phase starts when the swept - up mass , @xmath12 becomes comparable with the ejecta mass @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the number density of the interstellar medium ( ism ) and the proton mass , respectively .",
    "the free expansion velocity , @xmath16 , is obtained from @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the explosion energy of a supernova .",
    "then , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are represented by @xmath19 for simplicity , we assume @xmath20 and @xmath21 in this paper .      the maximum energy of accelerated particles is limited by a finite snr age , their cooling , or escape . hence it is obtained by comparisons of timescales , which are given as functions of a cr energy , @xmath22 , and the snr age , @xmath9 , ( see table  [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the acceleration time of dsa , @xmath23 , is represented by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the diffusion coefficient around the shock , and @xmath26 is a numerical factor which depends on the shock compression ratio and the spatial dependence of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "first , we assume the bohm - type diffusion of relativistic particles although the diffusion coefficient is still unclear when the magnetic field is strongly amplified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the bohm - type diffusion means that the mean free path of crs is proportional to the gyroradius of crs , where the constant of proportionality , @xmath27 , is the gyrofactor and @xmath28 for the bohm limit .",
    "then , the diffusion coefficient of crs is represented by @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath22 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the velocity of light , the energy of crs , the elementary charge and the magnetic field strength in the upstream region , respectively . in section  [ sec : magneticfield ] , we will give explicit forms of time dependence of @xmath32 and @xmath27 [ see eqs .",

    "the cooling time of cr electrons due to synchrotron emission in the downstream region , @xmath43 , is represented by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the electron mass and @xmath46 is the magnetic field strength in the downstream region . in this paper",
    ", we assume @xmath47 because of the shock compression .      for cr protons ,",
    "cooling is usually not important for a determination of the maximum energy .",

    "hereafter , we adopt @xmath66 .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the following fact .",

    "note that if the ratio of cr electrons to cr protons is @xmath283 and the number density of the ism is @xmath252 , inverse compton scattering due to runaway cr electrons dominates over the hadronic component at the tev energy region .",

    "the maximum energy of gamma rays from cr protons does not change because the cooling time of cr protons is longer than the snr age .",
    "therefore , radiation from cr protons can dominate over that from cr electrons at the @xmath214 energy region for middle - aged and/or old snrs .",

    "@xcite . figures  [ fig:5 ] , [ fig:6 ] , and [ fig:7 ] tell us that old snrs ( @xmath284 ) could be the origin of tev - unids .",

    "electrons with energies of a few tev can produce tev gamma - rays by inverse compton scattering with optical photons , but can not produce x - ray photons by synchrotron radiation with the magnetic field of @xmath286 .",
    "this is the same reason why pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) are plausible candidates for tev - unids @xcite .",
    "radiation from runaway cr electrons depends on the number of cr electrons , the diffusion coefficient around the snr , the snr age , and the source distance .",
    "for example , if the value of @xmath184 is larger than 0.1 , the flux of inverse compton scattering from runaway cr electrons around an snr older than @xmath287 with the distance @xmath288 is smaller than the sensitivity of h.e.s.s .",
    ", so that the number of currently detected tev unids is not so large .",
    "however , even in this case , we expect that future observations by cta will increase the number .    in addition , we comment on escape of cr electrons from pwne .",
    "@xcite investigated cr electron spectra from a young pulsar embedded in the snr , but did not take into account synchrotron cooling while cr electrons cross the snr shell . if the diffusion escape time from the snr is longer than the cooling time , @xcite is not valid .",
    "however , cr electrons are not produced at snr shocks for pwne .",
    "that is , the maximum energy of cr electrons produced in pwne could be larger than that produced at snr shocks . in this case ,",
    "cr electrons produced in pwne can escape from snrs as long as the diffusion escape time is smaller than the cooling time .",
    "this depends on the evolution of the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite proposed that the low energy cutoff of cr electrons escaping from nearby sources could be observed in the above tev band .",
    "therefore , @xcite is complementary to this paper that investigated the high energy cutoff .",
    "finally , we emphasize that escape of accelerated particles is common in other high energy particle accelerators ( e.g. microquasars , gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei ) , so that radiation of runaway accelerated particles from the accelerators can also be expected .",

    "<S> we show that cr electrons escape in order from high energies to low energies like cr nuclei , while the escape starts later than the beginning of the sedov phase at an snr age of @xmath0 and the maximum energy of runaway cr electrons is below the knee about @xmath1 because unlike cr nuclei , cr electrons lose their energy due to synchrotron radiation . </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , we also calculate the spatial distribution of runaway cr electrons and their radiation spectra around snrs . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to common belief , maximum - energy photons of synchrotron radiation around @xmath2 are emitted by runaway cr electrons which have been caught up by the shock . </S>",
    "<S> inverse compton scattering by runaway cr electrons can dominate the gamma - ray emission from runaway cr nuclei via pion decay , and both are detectable by cta and lhaaso as clues to the cr origin and the amplification of magnetic fluctuations around the snr . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss middle - aged and/or old snrs as unidentified very - high - energy gamma - ray sources .    </S>",
