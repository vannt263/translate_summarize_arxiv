    "the interaction of integral proteins with the lipids in which they are embedded is of great importance for membrane function ( dumas et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "one principal governing this interaction is that the length of the hydrophobic segment of protein should closely match that of the membrane which it spans ( bloom and mouritsen , 1984 ) . among the evidence that this hydrophobic matching is used in membrane organization",
    "is that the various membranes between the golgi and the plasma membrane have different thicknesses .",
    "proteins can be routed through the secretory pathway by increasing their hydrophobic thickness via mutagenesis and passing from one membrane to another more closely matching their new length ( pelham and munro 93 ) .",
    "the difference between the hydrophobic length of protein and membrane , denoted hydrophobic mismatch , affects _",
    "inter alia _ , lateral segregation of proteins in membranes ( marsh 1995 ; lehtonen and kinnunen 1997 ) , the lipid melting transition ( piknova et al . , 1993 ) , and protein activity ( johannsson et al .",
    "1981 : froud et al . 1986 ) .",
    "hydrophobic mismatch also affects the way in which the stabilty and the inclination of transmembrane helices change as functions of their hydrophobic length .",
    "such information is very important in predicting transmembrane domains from potential protein sequences ( rost et al .",
    "1995 ; edelman 1993 ) , a topic becoming increasely important in biology with the completion of the human genome project .    in an effort to elucidate such effects on a molecular level , killian and co - workers ( de planque et al . 1998 ) investigated the effect of a series of hydrophobic peptides on the mean thickness of phosphatidylcholine membranes with different tail lengths .",
    "the peptides consisted of a sequence , whose length could be adjusted , of alternating leucine and alanine flanked on both sides by two tryptophans .",
    "the latter prefer to reside just below the lipid head groups , and therefore serve as anchors for the peptide ( killian et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the n- and c- terminii were blocked , _",
    "the results of this study which are of the most interest to us are as follows :    * peptides whose hydrophobic thickness , @xmath0 , is smaller than that of the hydrophobic thickness , @xmath1 , of the bilayer cause a reduction in the bilayer thickness .",
    "* peptides whose hydrophobic thickness is larger than that of the bilayer cause an increase in the bilayer thickness . as the peptides are made longer , the membranes continue to thicken , but the increase in the membrane thickness is always less than the peptide increment . *",
    "an increase in the magnitude of mismatch , @xmath4 , whether due to peptides being too long or too short for the membrane , results in an increase in the fraction of peptides which fail to incorporate into the membrane .",
    "this effect has also been observed by ren et al .",
    "( ren et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the first observation is easily understood on simple energetic arguments , but the second is not .",
    "one might have expected the longer peptide simply to insert at an angle such that the membrane thickness is undisturbed ( killian , 1998 ) .",
    "however the thickness _ is _ disturbed , and grows with increased peptide length , but does not track that increase identically . to understand this puzzling behavior and to isolate the various factors which bring about the net result of hydrophobic mismatch is the primary purpose of this paper .",
    "many theoretical approaches have been applied to the effects of mismatch .",
    "almost all of them are phenomenological , based on treating the membrane as an elastic sheet .",
    "some have , however , included in these phenomenological descriptions some properties of the lipid tails , such as the ability of the tails to tilt to accommodate the perturbation of inserted proteins ( may and ben - shaul , 1999 ) . these approaches , which have recently been reviewed ( may 2000 )",
    ", are valuable in clarifying several aspects of the general problem of membrane impurities , and have even been applied ( may and ben - shaul , 1999 ) to the lamellar- inverted hexagonal transition induced by a sufficient concentration of peptide ( van der wei et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they lack a direct link to the molecular details of the system .",
    "a major theoretical advance was the work of fattal and ben - shaul ( fattal and ben - shaul , 1993 ) who provided a molecular theory for the behavior of the lipid chains of the membrane .",
    "the peptides , with their hydrophobic length , were treated as providing a boundary condition on the configuration of the lipid chains .",
    "this molecular modelling was combined with phenomenological free energy contributions describing lipid headgroup repulsion and membrane solvent surface tension . in this paper",
    "we eschew phenomenological description and present a molecular theory which , from straight forward statistical mechanics , yields the free energy of the entire system , lipid and peptide .",
    "we utilize a molecular lipid model employed earlier ( li and schick , 2000 ) and treat the peptide , which traverses the membrane as an alpha helix , as a rigid rod .",
    "we consider a lamellar phase formed by the lipid , and investigate the effect on the period of this phase due to the addition of peptide in small concentrations . as a consequence of our calculations ,",
    "we are able to reproduce all of the above results , elucidate the reasons for the increase in membrane thickness when penetrated by long peptides , and delineate several different effect of hydrophobic mismatch .",
    "we consider an anhydrous system of volume @xmath7 consisting of lipids and peptides whose numbers , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are controlled by the fugacities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the lipids consist of a headgroup of volume @xmath12 , and two equal - length tails each consisting of @xmath13 segments of volume @xmath14 .",
    "each lipid tail is characterized by a radius of gyration @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the statistical segment length .",
    "the peptide consists of a rigid , hydrophobic , core of @xmath17 segments each of length @xmath18 and volume @xmath19 and a terminal group at each end of volume @xmath20 .",
    "we choose these end segments to be hydrophilic so that the peptide indeed models a hydrophobic segment within an otherwise hydrophilic region .",

    "note that all number densities , @xmath27 , are defined to be dimensionless .",
    "we consider repulsive contact interactions between these four elements . in the simplest case ,",
    "the strengths of the repulsive interactions between the two hydrophilic and the two hydrophobic elements are the same , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 boltzmann s constant , and @xmath30 the absolute temperature .",

    "our model peptide is predominantly , but not completely , hydrophobic , the non - traversing peptides are found somewhat below the head - tail interface in the tail region of the bilayer . in order to determine how this amount of non - traversing peptides varies with the peptide length , we calculate the fraction of peptides with an end at an angle @xmath130 , @xmath131 this fraction is plotted _ vs. _ @xmath123 in the inset of fig .",
    "we see that the fraction which do not insert across the membrane increases with the mismatch between peptide and bilayer hydrophobic thicknesses , @xmath132 , irrespective of the sign of the mismatch .",

    "5 we plot the rate of bilayer thickening , @xmath138 , versus the relative peptide thickness @xmath139 . we see that the insertion of short peptides , @xmath140 , causes the period , and therefore the bilayer thickness , to contract , while the insertion of long peptides causes it to increase . as the peptides become longer , the rate of increase becomes smaller .",

    "our results replicate and illuminate the experimental results listed in the introduction .",
    "we recall and discuss them in turn .        *",
    "the insertion of peptides whose hydrophobic thickness is greater than that of the bilayer causes an increase in the bilayer thickness .",
    "as the peptides are made longer by a certain amount , @xmath142 , the membranes continue to thicken , but the increase in membrane thickness is less than @xmath142*.    we reproduce these results . as noted earlier , their origin is not obvious , for energetically the peptides would be satisfied to insert at an angle such that the bilayer would not deviate from its original thickness at all .",
    "the reason for this behavior , therefore , is clearly entropic . to understand it ,",
    "we need only recall the reason the bilayer thickness takes the value it does in the absence of peptide .",
    "the repulsive interaction between lipid headgroups and tails tends to crowd the head groups together which , from the constraint of incompressibility , causes the lipid tails to stretch .",
    "this tendency is opposed by the loss of tail entropy such stretching brings about .",
    "the equilibrium thickness of the bilayer results from a balance of these two tendencies .",
    "thus in the equilibrium configuration , the lipid tails are stretched ( fattal and ben - shaul , 1993 ) .",
    "peptides , being rigid , do not stretch , and therefore lose no such entropy if the bilayer thickens , while they displace lipid tails which restrain the membrane from thickening .",
    "thus it can be understood that the insertion of longer peptides causes the width of the bilayer to increase . within this mechanism ,",
    "however , there is no reason that a given increase in the length of the peptide should result in a corresponding increase in the thickness of the bilayer .",
    "the effect of replacing elastic lipids with rigid peptides predicts that the insertion of a much bulkier rigid object , such as gramacidin , will have a larger effect in increasing the bilayer thickness than will a less bulky one , such as a simple peptide .",
    "this is again in accord with experiment ( de planque , 1999 ) .    *",
    "an increase in the magnitude of mismatch , whether due to peptides being too long or too short for the membrane , results in an increase in the fraction of peptides which fail to incorporate in the membrane . *",
    "our calculation reproduces this as shown in the inset to fig .",
    "short peptides tend not to insert for energetic reasons .",
    "long peptides tend not to insert even though there is no energetic penalty to do so .",
    "presumably , they fail to insert due to the loss of lipid tail entropy , which increases with the length of the hydrophobic portion of the inserted peptide .",
    "in addition to reproducing these experimental results which demonstrates its efficacy , our model also yields predictions .",
    "as noted earlier , we found that insertion of peptides whose hydrophobic length is greater than the hydrophobic thickness of the membrane causes the membrane thickness to increase .",
    "as the peptide is made longer , the _ rate of increase _ of membrane thickness with peptide length , denoted @xmath138 in eq .",
    "( [ slope ] ) , decreases in accord with experiment ( de planque,2000 ) .",

    "5 ) actually causes the membrane thickness to _",
    "decrease_. we believe the reason for this is that a significant fraction of these long peptides do not traverse the membrane , but lie parallel to it .",
    "because the peptides have a much larger end group relative to its core than do the lipids , they create relatively more free volume for the lipid tails to fill , _",
    "i.e. _ they effectively increase the area per lipid head group . as the system is incompressible",
    ", this effect tends to make the bilayer thickness decrease .",
    "we have recently learned that this unusal thinning of the bilayer on the addition of relatively long peptides has been observed ( killian , 2001 ) .",
    "finally , our model makes predictions about the insertion of peptides at very low densities .",
    "short peptides , whose hydrophobic thickness is less than the hydrophobic thickness of the bilayer , insert normal to it .",
    "peptides with a hydrophobic thickness greater than that of the bilayer insert at an angle to the normal which grows with the hydrophobic mismatch .",
    "we expect the same behavior for proteins which span the membrane with a single alpha helix .",
    "as we have ignored local effects in the plane of the membrane , the actual angle of insertion will differ somewhat from that which we have calculated , but the qualitative behavior will not be changed . except for very large mismatches , our theory predicts the tilt to decrease with increasing peptide concentration .",
    "although there is much data on helix tilt in specific systems , there appears to be no attempt at a systematic correlation of it with hydrophobic mismatch .",
