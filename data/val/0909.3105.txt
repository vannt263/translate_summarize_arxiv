    "the exploration of the qcd phase diagram as well as the quantitative characterization of qcd matter is one of the most interesting challenges and questions in strong interaction physics .",
    "hot and dense qcd matter can be created in the laboratory by means of heavy ion collisions , and experiments at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have , over the years , revealed many intriguing and unexpected properties of this matter .",
    "for example the measurement of an unexpectedly large elliptic anisotropy @xmath1 @xcite can be reproduced within the framework of hydrodynamics @xcite , at least for low transverse momenta ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this observation has led to the conjecture , that the matter produced in these collisions is strongly interacting , with nearly ideal fluidity @xcite .",
    "several microscopic explanations for this behavior have been suggested @xcite@xcite@xcite , for example the `` magnetic scenario '' which features the co - existing electric and magnetic components of the plasma with the magnetic one ultimately enforcing the qcd confinement transition .",
    "arguments for the nearly ideal fluidity at center of mass energies of @xmath0 , quantitatively represented by a rather small ratio of shear - viscosity over entropy - density , @xmath3 , have come from different directions .",
    "firstly , the @xmath1 data measured at rhic have provided rather stringent constraints on viscous hydrodynamic calculations : the current status based on this approach is that an _ upper limit _ @xmath4 may be set @xcite .",
    "( some caveats on interpretation of @xmath1 data however should be kept in mind , such as hidden non - collective contributions to @xmath1 @xcite or alternative mechanism of producing @xmath1@xcite ) .",
    "secondly , recent developments from the ads / cft correspondence @xcite have hinted at a universal _ lower bound _ @xmath5 . while in principle violating examples have been found ( see detailed discussions in e.g. @xcite ) , for all practical purposes this value serves as a useful benchmark for good fluidity of _ relativistic fluids_. finally",
    ", the fluidity of the qcd fluid has been compared @xcite to a few commonly known substances like helium-4 , water , nitrogen etc , using the measure @xmath3 : it has been concluded that the qcd fluid has smaller @xmath3 as compared with all those normal substances .    in this paper",
    "we will revisit the concept of fluidity .",
    "for a sensible discussion of fluidity one needs to clearly distinguish the concept of _ fluidity _ from the concept of applicability and validity of hydrodynamics .",
    "the concept of fluidity of a substance can only be meaningful if the fluidity is defined exclusively in terms of properties of the substance itself .",
    "the question of applicability of hydrodynamics , on the other hand , requires the effective mean free path we will derive a more general expression for the relevant length scale which will not require the applicability of kinetic theory . in the kinetic limit it reduces to the mean free path . ] to be small compared to the size of the system or rather the typical wavelengths of the excitations which are supposed to be described within hydrodynamics .",
    "consequently , in this case we compare a property of the system , the mean free path , with an _ external _ scale characterizing the situation we want to describe within hydrodynamics , for example a sound mode of a given wavelength . and given a sufficiently large external scale , hydrodynamics is always applicable . for example we observe sound propagation in both water and air , and yet one would be inclined to assign a better _ fluidity _ to water than to air .",
    "therefore a meaningful definition of _ fluidity _ needs to measure the effective mean free path in terms of a length scale inherent to the substance itself .",
    "one obvious choice is the interparticle distance , or more generally , the density - density correlation length .",
    "this allows the comparison of substances with vastly different inherent length scales , such as water vs. a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "obviously , the minimum wavelength ( in meters ) for sound propagation even in a weakly interacting qgp is still considerably shorter than that of a strongly interacting atomic or molecular substance .",
    "however , if we ask the question `` what is the minimal wavelength for sound propagation measured in units of the interparticle distance ? '' then a comparison between these substances becomes meaningful , and the strongly interacting substance will likely exhibit a better fluidity .    following these general considerations , in this paper we discuss the fluidity of the hot and dense qcd matter created at rhic by comparing it with normal non - relativistic fluids and by applying valuable insights from those fluids .",
    "while such a comparison is not new ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) , we differ from all previous approaches in a few distinct points .",
    "first of all , we carefully examine the difference between the relativistic and non - relativistic fluids .",
    "this includes their different inertia : the relativistic inertia , i.e. the enthalpy , reduces to the mass density in the non - relativistic regime .",
    "this also includes the choice of reference scale , as discussed above : while the temperature may serve as a reasonable estimator for the interparticle distance for relativistic fluids , it certainly does not in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "based on these considerations , we propose a new measure of fluidity for comparing various fluids .",
    "furthermore we emphasize , for the first time , the possible relevance of the so - called supercritical fluid for the matter produced at rhic and discuss important implications for the expected fluidity for the matter produced in heavy ion collisions at different center of mass energies .",
    "we will also elaborate on potential consequences for the search of the qcd critical - end - point via a beam energy scan .",
    "as just discussed , a closely related , but different , question is the applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy ion collisions at various beam energy @xmath6 . for the description of the dynamical evolution of system within hydrodynamics to be valid",
    "the length scale characterizing the variations of the system needs to be large compared to the effective mean free path of the ( quasi ) particles within the fluid @xcite@xcite .",
    "thus , good fluidity of the underlying matter may not guarantee applicability of hydrodynamics , if the typical gradients of the flow field are large , e.g. when the system size is very small . based on an analysis of sound wave attenuation",
    ", we will provide quantitative criteria for the applicability of hydrodynamics , and evaluate the situations at sps , rhic , and lhc respectively .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : section_2 ] we will discuss the difference and relation between a non - relativistic(nr ) fluid and a relativistic(r ) fluid . in section [ sec : section_3 ] we will then propose a new fluidity measure , which is applicable for both relativistic and non - relativistic systems .",
    "based on this new measure we will compare various fluid systems and demonstrate the improvement of fluidity in a fluid s supercritical regime . in section [ sec : section_4 ] we will use lattice qcd results to construct equal - pressure lines on the qcd phase diagram .",
    "we then discuss the relationship between fluidity and supercriticality for heavy ion collisions , the evolution of fluidity with beam energies , and its implications for the search of the qcd critical - end - point(cep ) .",
    "finally in section [ sec : section_5 ] the applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy ion collisions at various energies will be discussed .",
    "when comparing a relativistic ( r ) with a non - relativistic ( nr ) fluid , one needs to carefully keep track of the mass terms , which customarily are neglected in non - relativistic thermodynamics . in non - relativistic thermodynamics",
    ", the basic thermodynamic relation @xmath7 does not take into account the mass of the particles . here",
    "@xmath8 refers to the _ kinetic and interaction _ energy of the particles .",
    "similarly , the chemical potential , which represents the increase of energy by the addition of one extra particle , does not account for the particle s mass . the relativistic version of the basic thermodynamic relation , @xmath9 on the other hand , takes into account the particle masses .",
    "its non - relativistic limit can be obtained by simply including the mass terms in both the energy and the chemical potential @xmath10 as we will discuss below ( see also @xcite ) , the thermodynamic quantity entering hydrodynamics is the enthalpy density , @xmath11 defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy density , @xmath14 the pressure , @xmath15 the entropy - density , and @xmath16 is the particle - density .",
    "as we will show , the non - relativistic limit of hydrodynamics involves the non - relativistic limit of the enthalpy , @xmath17 , _ including _ the mass term @xmath18 and it is dominated by the mass density . in the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath19 , on the other hand , the enthalpy density is given by @xmath20 the kinematic viscosity , which is defined as the ratio of the shear viscosity over the enthalpy density @xmath21 usually serves as a measure for dissipation @xcite .",
    "while the widely used ratio of shear - viscosity over entropy density , @xmath3 is indeed related with the kinematic viscosity for ultra - relativistic systems , it misses the dominant mass term for a non - relativistic fluid .    in the following ,",
    "we further demonstrate this point both in thermodynamics and in hydrodynamics , the boltzmann constant @xmath22 and the planck constant @xmath23 , while in the rest of the paper we use natural units with these constants taken to be unity . ] .",
    "we start with the example of a classical ( boltzmann ) , relativistic free gas at temperature @xmath24 and _ fixed ( net-)particle density _ @xmath25 . following standard statistical mechanics in e.g. @xcite ,",
    "the helmholtz free energy density is given by @xmath26}{n\\tilde{\\lambda}^3 } \\right)^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\mathbf{ln}\\left[\\frac{\\frac{n\\tilde{\\lambda}^3}{i\\left[\\beta mc^2\\right]}+\\sqrt{(\\frac{n\\tilde{\\lambda}^3}{i\\left[\\beta mc^2\\right]})^2 + 4}}{2 } \\right ] { \\bigg\\ } } \\quad\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "here we have introduced the re - scaled momentum integral , @xmath29 , @xmath30 \\equiv \\int_0^\\infty d\\tilde{p}\\ , \\tilde{p}^2\\ , e^{-\\sqrt{\\tilde{p}^2+(\\beta mc^2)^2}}. \\label{eq : momentum_integral}\\ ] ] using the usual thermodynamic relations we obtain expressions for other quantities , such as the chemical potential and the energy density : @xmath31}+\\sqrt{(\\frac{n\\tilde{\\lambda}^3}{i\\left[\\beta mc^2\\right]})^2 + 4}}{2 } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath32    next we examine the non - relativistic limit by taking @xmath33 in function @xmath34 $ ] , eq.[eq : momentum_integral ] , ( and its derivative @xmath35 / d y$ ] ) : @xmath36 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mu \\to \\,\\ , nr : \\ , mc^2 + ( k_b t ) \\mathbf{ln}(n\\lambda^3 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\epsilon \\to \\,\\ , nr : \\ , n mc^2 + \\frac{3}{2 } n ( k_b t)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath37 .",
    "obviously , in the non - relativistic regime the energy associated with the rest mass dominates the chemical potential , the free energy density , the energy density , and the enthalpy density .",
    "contrary to that , neither entropy density @xmath38 nor the pressure @xmath39 , have an explicit dependence of the mass term , as intuitively expected .",
    "we now turn to the hydrodynamics in the relativistic and non - relativistic regime .",
    "since the non - relativistic limit of relativistic hydrodynamics is discussed in textbooks @xcite , we will be brief here and just remind ourselves of the essential points , in particular how the relativistic inertia i.e. the enthalpy density @xmath11 is replaced in the non - relativistic limit by the mass density @xmath40 .",
    "we start with the non - relativistic navier - stokes ( n - s ) equation : @xmath41 \\vec v = - \\frac{\\vec \\bigtriangledown\\ , p}{\\rho } + \\frac{\\eta}{\\rho } \\vec{\\bigtriangledown_j \\sigma^{j i}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the non - relativistic shear tensor @xmath42 .",
    "the corresponding relativistic n - s equation is given by : @xmath43 \\vec v = & & - \\frac{1}{w / c^2 } [ \\vec \\bigtriangledown\\ , p + \\frac{\\vec v}{c } \\partial_0 p ] \\nonumber \\\\ & &   + \\frac{\\eta}{w / c^2 } \\vec{\\partial_\\nu \\sigma^{\\nu i } } \\,\\,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the relativistic shear tensor @xmath44 $ ] , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "in the non - relativistic limit one has @xmath48 , and @xmath49 and thus in leading order of @xmath50 recovers the non - relativistic navier - stokes equation @xcite .    to further elaborate the point ,",
    "let us consider the propagation and attenuation of a sound wave of frequency @xmath51 and wave vector @xmath52 ( @xmath53 is the wavelength ) in the presence of dissipation , characterized by the shear viscosity @xmath54 .",
    "the dispersion relation for the wave is given by @xmath55    to take into account possible bulk viscosity @xmath56 , one simply makes the replacement @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore the speed of sound @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 as one can see , the same correspondence @xmath60 appears again as in the thermodynamics eq.([eqn_thermodynamics ] ) .",
    "we end this section by a discussion of the ratio of shear - viscosity over entropy - density - ratio , @xmath3 , which has attracted a considerable interest in various fields of physics .",
    "we first recall , from the perspective motivated by studying the qgp via heavy ion collisions , why @xmath3 is a useful measure for the relativistic fluid , as was first pointed out in the seminal paper @xcite .",
    "consider a bjorken - type longitudinal expansion of the quark - gluon plasma ( with low baryonic density ) formed in heavy ion collisions : its system size is limited by @xmath61 at early time . with",
    "the presence of shear viscosity @xmath54 , there will be dissipative effect ( e.g. entropy generation ) characterized by the ratio @xmath62 ( roughly the knudsen number ) which , by thermodynamic relation eq.([eqn_thermo_ts ] ) @xmath63 , leads to @xmath64 . to ensure a controllable dissipative correction to the ideal hydrodynamics ,",
    "one requires firstly @xmath3 is small enough and , secondly , @xmath65 is of the order 1 or bigger .",
    "the former shall be a property of the underlying qgp while the latter means the viscous effect is most severe at early time and the hydrodynamic evolution may not be a good approximation at too early time .",
    "( note in this discussion we adopted natural relativistic units with @xmath66 ) .",
    "one can draw two conclusions from this discussion : ( a ) @xmath3 can serve as a good measure of fluidity for a relativistic fluid and the smaller it is the better the fluidity ; ( b ) the ability of @xmath3 to serve such a role is actually inherited from @xmath67 .",
    "the discussion above , however , leads to the observation that _",
    "@xmath3 for a non - relativistic fluid does not necessarily provide a good measure for its fluidity _ , because the role of the relativistic @xmath67 corresponds to the non - relativistic @xmath68 .",
    "this is certainly not a new lesson : it has been known from navier and stokes s time that what really matters for usual non - relativistic fluids fluidity is not the dynamical viscosity @xmath54 itself but rather the so - called kinematic viscosity @xmath68 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed by looking at actual data for water in the liquid and vapor phase at the same pressure one finds that liquid water has about one order of magnitude bigger shear viscosity , @xmath54 , but nonetheless `` wins the fluidity contest '' since its kinematic viscosity , @xmath68 , is about two orders of magnitude smaller than that of the vapor phase .",
    "we note that , the expression @xmath67 for a relativistic fluid is a relativistic version of the kinematic viscosity ( see also related discussions in @xcite ) . to conclude , we emphasize that for a non - relativistic fluid @xmath68 is different from @xmath3 ( as is evident from the thermodynamics discussion ) and only @xmath68 serves as a good measure of fluidity ( as is evident from the hydrodynamics discussion ) .",
    "this also implies that using @xmath3 to compare the fluidity between a relativistic fluid ( like the qgp , the ads / cft plasma ) and a non - relativistic fluid ( like helium , water or cold fermion gas @xcite ) may not be as informative as one would expect .",
    "in this section we propose a new fluidity measure that is suitable for comparison between relativistic and non - relativistic fluids . in the following",
    "we will analyze the propagation of sound modes in the presence of dissipation ( viscosity ) and ask ourselves under what condition the dissipative ( viscous ) terms in the equations prevent sound from propagating .",
    "the advantage of this strategy is that we stay entirely within the framework of viscous hydrodynamics and do not need to make additional assumptions , such as the applicability of kinetic theory . as a consequence",
    "our fluidity measure will be expressed in terms of well defined quantities such as the shear viscosity , the speed of sound , etc .",
    "we start with the sound dispersion relation in eq.([eqn_sound_dispersion ] ) . by requiring the imaginary part of the frequency , @xmath69 , to be small in magnitude as compared with its real part @xmath70",
    ", we obtain : @xmath71 the above equation implies that if a sound wave has its wavelength @xmath53 comparable ( or even smaller ) than @xmath72 , it will be quickly damped on ( or shorter than ) a time scale of its period and spatially on a length scale about ( or shorter than ) its wavelength , which essentially means it can not propagate away in the medium .",
    "therefore , the physical meaning of the length @xmath72 introduced above is to provide a measure for the _ minimal _ wavelength of a sound wave to propagate in such a viscous fluid becomes larger than the thermal relaxation time scale @xmath73 ( with @xmath74 the thermal diffusivity ) at wavelength smaller than @xmath75 , then heat transport becomes rather efficient and the sound propagation becomes isothermal ( see examples in e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless additional sources for dissipation do not change the fact that the `` good '' sound modes shall have their wavelengths ( at least ) larger that the @xmath72 set by shear viscosity only . ] .",
    "a more quantitative criteria will be discussed in section [ sec : section_5 ] and given in eq.([eqn_criteria ] ) .",
    "furthermore the length @xmath72 has the meaning of an effective mean - free - path ( mfp ) in terms of microscopic fluid particle motion .",
    "this becomes transparent in a weakly coupled gas : taking the non - relativistic gas as an example , the shear viscosity according to kinetic transport is @xmath76 while the speed of sound is @xmath77 with @xmath78 the thermal velocity .",
    "these lead to the combination @xmath79 unlike the mean - free - path which is conceptually intuitive but practically not easily computable or measurable ( e.g. for fluids ) , the length @xmath72 is well - defined by macroscopic properties of the fluid and thus of practical use .",
    "we emphasize that involving the speed of sound in the definition of length scale @xmath72 is essential .",
    "this can be seen already from a dimensional argument : @xmath68 or @xmath80 has the dimension of @xmath81 ^ 2\\,[time]^{-1}$ ] . to turn this into a length scale one needs to divide it by a quantity of the dimension @xmath81\\,[time]^{-1}$ ] i.e. a velocity .",
    "the natural choice here is the speed of sound as a characteristic of the macroscopic matter .",
    "the speed of light , @xmath82 , on the other hand is _ not _ suitable here since it is neither a property of any specific substance nor should it be of any relevance to non - relativistic fluids , such as water .",
    "since the speed of sound changes considerably close to a phase - transition or a rapid crossover , its inclusion in the fluidity measure @xmath83 and in the effective mean free path @xmath72 is essential .    next we need to introduce another meaningful length scale to make a dimensionless ratio : this becomes a necessity when comparing fluids at vastly different scales . in case of the",
    "well known dimensionless ratios like the knudsen and reynolds numbers , an _",
    "external _ length scale characteristic of the fluid motion is introduced , like the diameter of a pipe or the size of a moving object inside the fluid , etc . in the context of relativistic fluids created in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "there have been scaling studies of collective flow for lower energy collisions based on the reynolds number in @xcite and more recently for higher energy collisions based on the knudsen number in @xcite ( see also related discussions in @xcite ) . the external length scale in those numbers ,",
    "however , is not an _ intrinsic _ property of the fluid that we would like to invoke for comparing fluids across vastly different scales .",
    "instead , a de - correlation length of certain density - density spatial correlator gives a natural scale of short - range order in the system . in most cases this de - correlation length is simply set by the inter-(quasi-)particle distance . for a non - relativistic fluid `` particles '' and their number density @xmath16",
    "are well - defined , and thus the inter - particle distance is also a well - defined length scale : @xmath84 for relativistic fluid it is less straightforward .",
    "for example a qgp with @xmath85 and thus @xmath86 can still have substantial numbers of quarks and gluons .",
    "for such a relativistic fluid a simple estimate can be made via the entropy density , i.e. @xmath87 .",
    "another way is to calculate the de - correlation length of e.g. the correlator @xmath88 as has been done in recent lattice work @xcite which finds a short range order about @xmath89 for qgp in @xmath90 , in reasonable agreement with estimate from @xmath91 .",
    "there could still be academic examples where the entropy density can be infinite while the short - range order does _ not _ vanish : ads / cft offers such an example in which the entropy density goes as @xmath92 ( in the large @xmath93 limit ) implying @xmath94 while spatial correlators like @xmath95 give a non - zero de - correlation length @xmath96 .",
    "we will return to these issues in the subsection [ sec : sub_3_2 ] .",
    "finally by taking a ratio of the two length scales , we arrive at a fluidity measure @xmath97 below we will first show that the measure works well for non - relativistic fluids and bears certain universality for critical fluids .",
    "we will then show that the so - called supercritical fluids have even better fluidity . at the end we present a comparison of various interesting fluids .",
    "following @xcite , we have extensively used the measured data for various fluids from the nist webbook @xcite .",
    "0.01 in    we first examine various fluids at fixed critical pressure @xmath98 . in fig.[fig_critical_fluids](left ) , the proposed fluidity measure @xmath99 is plotted for _ fifteen _ different substances at their respective critical pressure @xmath100 , including : hydrogen ( @xmath101 ) , helium-4 ( @xmath102 ) , water ( @xmath103 ) , deuterium oxide ( @xmath104 ) , neon ( @xmath105 ) , nitrogen ( @xmath106 ) , oxygen ( @xmath107 ) , argon ( @xmath108 ) , carbon dioxide ( @xmath109 ) , krypton ( @xmath110 ) , xenon ( @xmath111 ) , isobutane ( @xmath112 ) , octane ( @xmath113 ) , dodecane ( @xmath114 ) , octafluorocyclobutane ( @xmath115 ) . these substances cover a wide range of molar mass , chemical structure and complexity , with their respective critical temperature @xmath116 and pressure @xmath100 differing by orders of magnitude . despite such huge differences ,",
    "their fluidity curves resemble each other not only in shape but even _",
    "quantitatively_. in particular in their good liquid regime  roughly the `` valley '' region at @xmath117  they all show amazingly similar fluidity . to further expose the similarity , in the right panel of fig.[fig_critical_fluids ] we show the value of the fluidity measure @xmath118 at its minimum versus the substances molecular molar masses . from this plot ,",
    "roughly two bands can be identified : the green stars spread in a narrow band of @xmath119 while spanning two - orders - of magnitude in molar mass which include all 11 non - organic substances ; the red diamonds with roughly twice bigger @xmath118 , include 4 organic substances with much more complicated molecular structures ( e.g. chains ) which , not surprisingly , lead to more dissipation .",
    "even so , the splitting in fluidity between the two bands is merely a @xmath120 factor rather than any order - of - magnitude difference .",

    "it is also interesting to examine whether the length scale @xmath72 itself shows similar trends , as @xmath72 is the essential scale for discussing the applicability of hydrodynamics where it is to be compared with the external scale characterizing the variation of flow field . in the right panel of fig.[fig_water_run_p ] we plot @xmath72 itself for the same conditions and find that , similar to the fluidity measure @xmath121 , the scale @xmath72 also becomes considerably smaller in supercritical water .",

    "we finally come to the comparison in fig.[fig_comparison ] .",
    "as one can see , the critical fluids ( water and helium-4 at @xmath100 ) have a somewhat worse fluidity than the qcd , ads / cft and cold fermi atom systems .",
    "supercritical water at @xmath164 , on the other hand , already has a fluidity comparable to the qgp while at @xmath165 the fluidity of supercritical water appears to be better than that of the recently discussed `` nearly perfect fluids '' .",
    "the fluidity study in the previous section , in particular on the supercritical fluid , naturally leads to the following interesting question : _ are we observing a supercritical qcd fluid at rhic ? _",
    "as is well known , what is usual referred to as @xmath166 in qcd is _ not _ a true second - order phase transition temperature but rather the temperature for a rapid crossover at @xmath167 @xcite .",
    "there is , however , a ( hypothetical ) critical - end - point(cep ) at @xmath168 on the qcd phase diagram marking the end of a plausible first - order phase transition at low @xmath24 but high @xmath169 ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein )",
    ". accurate determination of the cep from lattice qcd @xcite and unambiguous observation of the cep from heavy ion collisions @xcite are among the most interesting and exciting goals of qcd research .",
    "while currently the position of the cep is not well constrained , it is expected to have lower temperature than that of the qcd crossover transition at vanishing baryon density , @xmath170 .",
    "being very aware on the present uncertainty of the actual location of the qcd critical end point , let us , solely for demonstration purposes and for the sake of the argument , assume that its location is close to the estimate of ref .",
    "@xcite , which suggests that @xmath171 .",
    "this location is indicated in fig.[fig_qcd ] as the filled black circle along with a question mark .",
    "next if we adopt the definition of supercriticality as in eq.([eqn_super_critical ] ) for qcd , we need to know the constant - pressure lines on the qcd phase diagram typically plotted in terms of @xmath172 . to schematically construct these lines ,",
    "we make use of the taylor expansion of the pressure @xmath173 with respect to @xmath169 : @xmath174}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath175 the baryonic susceptibilities @xcite . in order to construct the equal - pressure lines shown in fig.[fig_qcd ]",
    "we have used the lattice qcd results from cheng et al for @xmath176 @xcite and @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "( color online ) schematic isobaric contours ( i.e. with constant pressure along each line ) on the qcd @xmath172 phase diagram with the filled black circle indicating a possible position of the _ hypothetical _ critical - end - point ( cep ) ; the dashed blue horizontal short line stretching from the cep to the right is included to indicate the @xmath178 boundary ( see text for more details ) .",
    "the filled red , blue and green circles indicate estimates of the initial @xmath179 reachable at sps , rhic and lhc , respectively . , width=321 ]    0.01 in    the blue curve in fig.[fig_qcd ] going right through the indicated cep point indicates the constant - pressure line with fixed critical pressure @xmath180 which , together with the @xmath178 line ( dashed blue horizontal one stretching from the cep to the right ) form the boundary above which there is the _ qcd supercritical region_. we emphasize that above the boundary the pressure @xmath181 increases very rapidly . as a result",
    "the qgp quickly enters deeply into the supercritical regime where @xmath182 .",
    "to give an idea : the pressures of the lines in units of the critical pressure @xmath183 ( value on the blue curve ) are ( from bottom to top ) @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 , @xmath194 , respectively . of course with improved lattice results for pressure , cep and ( higher order ) susceptibilities a more accurate equal - pressure map for qcd matter will become available .",
    "we now discuss a few implications for heavy ion collisions experiments . as a precaution , the following discussions are by no means intended to provide quantitative statements but rather qualitative yet interesting ideas .",
    "+ ( i ) at current rhic energy ( @xmath195 ) , fig.[fig_qcd ] indicates that most of the qgp phase of the created matter is likely in the supercritical region",
    ". this may very well be the reason why such good fluidity has been observed .",
    "if a relationship between good fluidity and supercriticality is indeed true for the qcd matter just as it is for water , then there will be _ a sensitive dependence of the fluidity on the actual position of the cep .",
    "_ for example , the matter created at rhic might have most of its evolution being in the supercritical region in case @xmath196 and @xmath197 are considerably lower than indicated in the fig.[fig_qcd ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the matter created at sps ( @xmath198 ) seems to have its initial pressure and temperature already rather close to the critical one which would result in poor fluidity . in principle",
    "these regions ( supercritical , near - cep , below - cep ) of very different fluidity can be accessed experimentally by tuning the center of mass energy @xmath6 which changes the initial densities ( see e.g. @xcite ) as well as the freeze - out points ( see e.g. @xcite@xcite ) in such collisions .",
    "to which extend this difference in fluidity transforms into measurable effects , such as non - hydrodynamic behavior and thus less elliptic flow , is a non - trivial question . as we will discuss in the next section , besides the fluidity the actual size of the system is essential for the applicability of hydrodynamics .",
    "our estimates ( see fig.[fig_qcd_leta ] ) show that even for the very good fluidity assumed for a strongly interacting qgp , denoted as `` sqgp '' in fig.[fig_comparison ] , a hydrodynamic description for the fireball expansion is a best marginal at sps energies .",
    "the reason is that , according to our estimate , the system starts close to the phase transition and , thus , reaches the hadronic phase while still comparatively small in size .",
    "consequently , it may be difficult to tell if the system enters a regime of reduced fluidity from flow studies alone .",
    "of course if our estimates are wrong and one finds evidence that the initial entropy density reached is considerably larger , a change in the fluidity may show up in the systematics of elliptic flow measurements , such as its dependence on beam energy and system size .",
    "+ ( ii ) based on the possibility of a mostly supercritical qcd matter to be created in experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) ( see fig.[fig_qcd ] ) , one is led to predict _ an even better fluidity to be observed at lhc than at rhic_. and since for the same fluidity the conditions for hydrodynamics are more favorable for lhc energies than for rhic , we would expect nearly ideal hydrodynamic evolution at lhc .",
    "in this section we turn to a discussion of applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy ion collisions , particularly for sps , rhic and lhc .",
    "as already discussed in the introduction , the fluidity of the underlying matter is _ not _ the only determining factor : the `` best '' ( in terms of fluidity ) fluid may cease to flow if put into a sufficiently narrow pipe .",
    "in other words , the applicability of hydrodynamics depends equally on both the _ internal _ properties of the substance , i.e. its fluidity @xmath83 or @xmath72 , and the _ external _ settings , i.e the typical length scale @xmath199 of the variation of the flow field in the system under consideration is a well defined quantity depending only on macroscopic variables that are measurable and/or calculable .",
    "furthermore unlike the mean - free - path which depends on quasi - particle picture ( see e.g. discussions in @xcite ) , the length scale @xmath72 remains a useful and meaningful scale even for strongly coupled systems . ] : one useful criteria , equivalent to the famous knudsen number , is a ratio of the two @xmath200 .    in order to derive a quantitative criterion",
    ", we again use the example of sound dispersion discussed before . by requiring that a propagating sound wave has to complete at least one full period before its amplitude damps by a factor @xmath201 due to the imaginary part",
    ", we arrive at a _ minimal _ wave length @xmath202 . for a sound wave the length scale characterizing the flow field variations simply the wavelength , @xmath203 .",
    "thus we arrive at the following criterion for the applicability of hydrodynamics : @xmath204     0.3 in   0.01 in    the length @xmath205 for qcd ( at @xmath167 ) , shown in fig.[fig_qcd_leta](left ) , is determined as described section [ sec : sub_3_2 ] .",
    "it relies on a parametrization for @xmath206 from the hirano - gyulassy @xcite , and we note that the actual shear viscosity of qcd matter , once it is known , may be quite different .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath72 shown in the plot features a steep drop from the hadronic phase to about @xmath207 , followed by a rather constant value for temperatures above , @xmath208 .",
    "one may expect @xmath72 becomes large again at very high temperatures @xmath145 where a weakly coupled qgp describable by pqcd takes over . in principle",
    "@xmath72 also depends on the baryon - number chemical potential , @xmath209 , and this dependence shall be taken into account when discussing collisions at low energy ( such as sps ) where @xmath209 could be sizable .",
    "however currently very little is known about such dependence , and we here use the zero @xmath169 result also for sps .    we next give a rough estimate for the typical length scale @xmath199 of flow field variance for heavy ion collisions at different @xmath6 . at early times , right after the collision , the system size is limited mainly by its longitudinal extent and the scale governing the variation in the fluid can be estimated to be about @xmath210 . at late time",
    "when @xmath211 becomes larger than the nuclear radius @xmath212 the limiting scale is set by the transverse size of the fireball which is slightly larger than @xmath213 and slowly grows .",
    "for the purpose of our rough estimate , we adopt a simple prescription : @xmath214 for @xmath215 and @xmath216 for @xmath217 with @xmath218 for auau and pbpb collisions . for the collision dynamics which determines the temperature evolution @xmath219 ( or inversely @xmath220 ) , we simply use the bjorken flow relation @xmath221 , which up to @xmath222 is a reasonable approximation . for the initial condition",
    "we follow estimates used in hydrodynamic modelling ( see e.g. @xcite ) and assume equilibration at @xmath223 , with fireball center entropy densities ( in central collisions ) to be @xmath224 at sps , @xmath225 at rhic , and @xmath226 at lhc .",
    "finally we turn to the discussion of the applicability of hydrodynamics given the criteria of eq.[eqn_criteria ] .",
    "the ratio @xmath200 in units of @xmath227 is plotted in fig.[fig_qcd_leta](right ) for sps(red diamonds ) , rhic(blue stars ) , and lhc(green boxes ) .",
    "the thick dashed horizontal line indicates the equality of the condition expressed by eq.[eqn_criteria ] : if the system is considerably below this line a hydrodynamic description should be a reasonable approximation .",
    "if it finds itself considerably above corrections to hydrodynamics from higher orders in derivatives or an even non - hydrodynamic description are called for . to quantify the previous statement ,",
    "if the system finds itself at a value of @xmath228 , such as the points for sps energies on fig.[fig_qcd_leta](left ) , then the amplitude of a sound mode after propagating the distance of one wavelength will be reduced by a factor of @xmath229 , and for a value of @xmath230 the reduction would be @xmath231 ! given our estimate and the assumptions which it is based on , a hydrodynamic description is not a good approximation for sps , whereas for rhic and even more so for lhc energies , it seems to be more or less justified .",
    "such differences from sps to rhic and lhc lie in the different time evolution due to the different initial densities : when cooling down into the region where @xmath72 starts rising abruptly near and below @xmath116 , the sps fireball still has a rather small size ( longitudinally ) while the rhic and lhc fireballs already becomes large with a size about @xmath232 and hence have their hydrodynamic evolution extended much longer . while our estimates contain uncertainties and should by no means considered to be precise , we have provided a semi - quantitative picture for evaluating the applicability of hydrodynamics with varying @xmath6 , which implies at lhc the fireball expansion shall be even better described by hydrodynamics as compared to rhic .    besides the beam energy @xmath6",
    ", a change of the system size should also affect the conditions for the applicability of hydrodynamics .",
    "for example , rhic has done experiments with both auau collisions and cucu collisions , both at full energy , and it would be interesting to examine and compare the applicability of hydrodynamics for these two different systems . in fig.[fig_qcd_leta ]",
    "( right ) we have included a calculation of the same applicability measure for cucu ( orange triangle ) collisions at @xmath233 , with a initial center entropy density @xmath234 and a transverse size parameter @xmath235 .",
    "the curve indicates that hydrodynamics is marginally applicable for such collisions , as both the initial density and the transverse size of the matter formed in cucu collisions are smaller that those in auau collisions at the same energy .",
    "in summary , we have discussed the fluidity of the hot and dense qcd matter as produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions in comparison with various other , well known fluids . in particular",
    "we have suggested its possible supercriticality based on insights gained from studying more conventional fluids like water .",
    "we have discussed several aspects relevant for a proper comparison of non - relativistic and relativistic fluids , both from thermodynamics and hydrodynamics perspectives .",
    "a new fluidity measure @xmath236 is then proposed , which shows certain universality in the good fluid regime for a remarkable diverse set of critical fluids .",
    "we have further demonstrated that the fluidity is enhanced in the supercritical fluid regime on a fluid s phase diagram .",
    "these studies inspired us to conjecture that the seemingly good fluidity of the qcd matter at rhic may actually be related to its supercriticality with respect to the critical - end - point on the qcd phase diagram .",
    "this observation , if true , has far - reaching consequences for heavy ion collisions experiments : ( a ) the loss of such good fluidity at certain lower beam energy which is sensitively related to the position of the long sought cep ; ( b ) an even better fluidity may be expected at higher beam energy , which will soon be tested by the lhc heavy ion program .",
    "finally we have analyzed the applicability of hydrodynamics for the fireball evolution in heavy ion collisions at various energies .",
    "our analysis was based on a model parametrization for the shear - viscosity and a rough estimate of the relevant length scales governing the fireball expansion .",
    "given these assumptions we find that hydrodynamics should be applicable for collisions at rhic and lhc energies but not for sps energies .",
