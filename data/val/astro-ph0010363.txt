    "scattering by density inhomogeneities in the ionized interstellar medium causes multiple rays to interfere , producing frequency structure in the spectra of spatially coherent sources such as pulsars @xcite .",
    "the relatively high transverse velocities of most pulsars cause the spectra to change significantly on timescales of minutes to hours .",
    "when the spectrum is monitored over time , the resulting two - dimensional array or `` dynamic spectrum '' is often dominated by a random pattern of scintillation maxima with characteristic bandwidth and timescale @xcite . on occasion , however , more organized features are present .",
    "the best studied of these are periodic fringe patterns in the dynamic spectra due to the interference between two or more discrete bundles of rays or , equivalently , rays arriving from multiple images on the sky ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rlg ) .    a less well - studied pattern in pulsar dynamic spectra consists of a crisscross of intensity maxima that are variably spaced perpendicular to the ridge lines of the maxima .",
    "cordes and wolszczan ( 1986 ) drew attention to these `` multiple drift rates '' in dynamic spectra , building on earlier work ( hewish 1980 ; roberts & ables 1982 ; hewish , wolszczan , & graham 1985 ; cordes , weisberg , & boriakoff 1985 ) .",
    "numerous examples of the phenomenon are evident in the dynamic spectra presented by gupta , rickett , & lyne ( 1994 ) in their multi - year study of 8 pulsars , but the autocorrelation analysis that they employed is not well suited to its full elucidation",
    ". the remarkable episode of `` fringing '' in the dynamic spectra of psr  b0834 + 06 that rlg explore is also accompanied at all epochs by this phenomenon .",
    "the central result of our study is to show that this crisscross pattern has a much clearer representation in transform space , where it is seen to be a high - q phenomenon with a characteristic parabolic curvature .",
    "we discuss the constraints that the presence of this pattern places on the image geometry and speculate on the physical structures that might give rise to this scattering geometry .",
    "our observations were made at the arecibo observatory at 430  mhz .",
    "spectra across a 10  mhz band centered on this frequency were produced by a fourier - transform - based spectrometer ( aoftm ) .",
    "rcp and lcp signals were summed in hardware , and spectra with 1024 frequency channels ( i.e. 10  khz frequency resolution ) were produced every @xmath2  1.6  ms . during later analysis",
    "the spectra were synchronously averaged at the pulsar period , calculated using tempo @xcite , and summed over 10  s time intervals , creating a cube with axes of time , frequency , and pulsar rotational phase .",
    "we used 512 phase bins across the pulsar period .",
    "dynamic spectra were created by producing an on - pulse spectrum from a window of phase bins centered on the pulse and subtracting an off - pulse spectrum to remove the baseline .",
    "we observed 19 pulsars during 1999 january and 11 pulsars during 2000 january .",
    "a typical observation lasted one hour ; we made 46 and 43 separate observations at the two observing epochs , respectively .",
    "following several previous studies ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; rlg ) we produced two - dimensional power spectra from the dynamic spectra .",
    "these `` secondary spectra '' form the basis for most of the further analysis reported here .",
    "we normalized each secondary spectrum by its maximum and converted the relative power levels into a decibel scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : dynsec ] shows dynamic and secondary spectra for psr  b0834 + 06 .",
    "the crisscross pattern in the dynamic spectrum shows up in the secondary spectrum as two parabolic features , curving away from the conjugate time axis , that we call `` arcs '' .",
    "these arcs are remarkable for their narrowness and extent . in figure",
    "[ fig : coadded ] we present secondary spectra , averaged over multiple days to improve dynamic range .",
    "psr  b0823 + 26 and psr  b0834 + 06 showed a persistent arc pattern over both the 1999 and 2000 observing runs . in 2000 , psr  b0919 + 06 showed arcs that were relatively broad and faint and , hence , showed up only upon averaging of @xmath3 secondary spectra .",
    "however , we did not see arcs in two high - quality 1999 observations .",
    "psr  b1133 + 16 showed arcs during most of the 1999 and 2000 observations , but several high - quality 2000 observations failed to show them , even though they were made on days adjacent to those on which they were present .",
    "psr  b1933 + 16 did not show the arc pattern in either of two high - quality observations in 1999 or 2000 .",
    "time variability of the arcs will be the subject of a separate study .",
    "we detected arcs in the secondary spectra of pulsars b0823 + 26 , b0834 + 06 , b0919 + 06 , and b1133 + 16 . by using the relationship between fringe frequencies in the secondary spectrum and scattering parameters ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ; rlg ; gupta , bhat , & rao 1999 )",
    ", we can analyze the arcs more quantitatively . here",
    "we summarize a more detailed study that will be reported elsewhere ( cordes 2001 ) . to simplify calculations",
    ", these treatments assume that the scattering takes place in a thin screen a distance @xmath4 from the pulsar , with the pulsar - observer distance @xmath5 .",
    "they show that the interference between two points @xmath6 on the image plane ( i.e. as seen by an observer ) will lead to two - dimensional fringing in the dynamic spectrum with fringe frequencies f_t & = & ( ) ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) , [ eq : ft ] + f _ & = & ( ) ( d- ) ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) .",
    "[ eq : fnu ] here @xmath7 is the conjugate time axis , @xmath8 is the conjugate frequency axis , and the effective velocity ( cordes & rickett 1998 ) is a weighted sum of the velocities of the source , screen and observer , = ( 1 - /d)+ ( /d ) -",
    ". we can introduce the dimensionless variables p & = & ( _ 2 ^ 2 - _ 1 ^ 2 ) = f _ , [ eq : pbar ] + q & = & ( _ 2 - _ 1 ) = f_t , [ eq : qbar ] where @xmath9 is a two - dimensional unit vector for the effective velocity .",
    "since @xmath10 is quadratic in image angles and @xmath11 is linear in image angles , @xmath10 will generally be quadratic in @xmath11 .",
    "this is essential to explaining the parabolic curvature of the arcs .",
    "if we make the reasonable assumption that the pulsar velocity is much greater than either the velocity of the earth or the screen , equations  ( [ eq : pbar])([eq : qbar ] ) can be simplified to p & = & f _ , [ eq : pnew ] + q & = & f_t , [ eq : qnew ] where @xmath12 , and we approximate @xmath13 by the measured proper motion speed , @xmath14 . a parabolic arc ( @xmath15 ) in the p - q plane then corresponds to a feature in the secondary spectrum of curvature f _ & = & ( ) f_t^2 .",
    "[ eq : dyn - arc ] in this model , the curvature of the arcs is determined solely by the screen placement , the pulsar distance , and the pulsar proper motion .",
    "thus , by measuring the curvature of the arcs in the secondary spectrum , we can determine a value for the screen placement that is consistent with the observations and assumed values of @xmath5 and @xmath16 , as in table  [ tab : screen ] .",
    "gupta ( 1995 ) used diffractive bandwidth and timescale measurements to determine @xmath17 , the speed of the scintillation pattern past the observer ( cordes and rickett 1998 ) . assuming that the scattering is dominated by a thin screen",
    ", one can determine the screen placement for which @xmath17 is consistent with @xmath16 .",
    "this is determined from gupta s @xmath18 parameter by @xmath19 .",
    "table  [ tab : screen ] shows that the values of @xmath20 agree well with those for @xmath21 , calculated with eq .",
    "although the values of @xmath20 agree well with those for @xmath21 , the agreement may be only proportionate because there are significant uncertainties in both the distances and the iss parameters used by gupta ; also , scattering is likely to receive contributions from the distributed ism as well as from a screen . in particular , a recent study of b0919 + 06 ( chatterjee 2001 ) that compares scintillation velocity estimates , which are epoch dependent , and the parallax and proper motion determined from vlba observations , finds that a thin screen must be combined with a distributed medium such as that of the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model to bring agreement between the two velocity estimates . at some epochs",
    ", the screen evidently causes multiple imaging of the pulsar .    from equation  ( 1 )",
    "it can be seen that the vertical ( @xmath7 ) extent of arc features in the secondary spectrum is related to the angular extent of the scattering image along the effective velocity vector .",
    "table  1 shows the typical angular extent of the filament , @xmath22 , and the corresponding linear size on the screen , @xmath23 , inferred from the value of @xmath7 for a generic model .",
    "we analyze the distribution of power in the secondary spectrum with a sequence of vertical cuts , as in figure  [ fig : cuts ] .",
    "the rapid decline of power above the arcs strongly limits the image geometries that are consistent with the data . in order to exclude power above the arc",
    ", points must satisfy @xmath24 . referring to equations  ( [ eq : pbar])([eq : qbar ] ) ,",
    "this constraint can be expressed as _ 2 ^ 2-_1 ^ 2 & & ( _ 2x-_1x)^2 , [ eq : inequality ] where the @xmath25  components are along the effective velocity vector .",
    "a single extended image has many image pairs that violate this condition and , hence , will produce a large amount of power above the arcs , inconsistent with the behavior seen . hence , a multiple image geometry is required to produce the clearly delineated arcs we observe .",
    "one configuration that satisfies eq .",
    "9 , having no detectable power above the arcs , consists of a bright point - like image at the origin ( direct line of sight to the pulsar ) and a faint secondary image as a filled halo around it .",
    "the interference between a point at the origin and any other image point can not produce power above the arcs because @xmath26 .",
    "if the point - like image and halo have flux densities proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , then the point - like source will produce a point - like feature at the origin of the secondary spectrum with power proportional to @xmath29 ( e.g.  cordes & wolszczan 1986 ) .",
    "the inter - image interference between the point - source and the halo will produce power proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "the self - interference between regions of the halo ( which _ will _ produce power above the arcs ) will be proportional to @xmath31 .",
    "since this is smaller by another factor of @xmath32 from the inter - image term , then , for small @xmath32 , the only detectable power will be a point - source at the origin and power below the arcs .",
    "although the point - source plus halo model is consistent with the observations , the scattering material in the screen would need to be inhomogeneous enough that the direct image of the pulsar would shine through , but rays slightly off - axis would be scattered . in essence , we would need to be seeing the pulsar through a break in the interstellar `` clouds '' , consistent with the time - variability of the arcs . on the other hand ,",
    "there is strong evidence for scattering geometries based on filamentary structures @xcite .",
    "however , the self - interference between filaments will lead to features which are inconsistent with our data .",
    "any viable model based on filamentary features in the image plane must somehow hide these self - interference features as well as produce the observed parabolic arcs .",
    "the formalism used here includes only geometric delays , whereas differential dispersive delays may be important in some cases .",
    "the fact that the observed arcs conform to the geometric - only formalism implies that at least in some instances the dispersive effects are small .",
    "we have examples of secondary spectra that show more complex behavior and will analyze them within the more general framework in a later paper .",
    "an extended medium , as opposed to a single screen , also will be explored .",
    "while there are many possibilities for source geometries , it is clear that a multicomponent scattered image is necessary . in future papers",
    ", we will apply this method to better understand the structure of the ism on small spatial scales .",
