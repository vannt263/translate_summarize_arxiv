    "one of the obvious properties of the milky way that we want to learn is its morphology . the fact that we reside inside the milky way hinders us from a global view of our own galaxy which we enjoy over other galaxies .",
    "william herschel made use of star count ( sc ) to get a rough idea of how the milky way looks like in the eighteenth century @xcite .",
    "the advance in data collecting and analysis methods in late twentieth century let research groups ( such as * ? ? ?",

    "although many studies have been carried out , a common consensus on the structural parameters of the milky way has not been reached yet .",
    "one of the reasons can be attributed to different sky regions and limiting magnitudes ( i.e. , limiting volumes ) were used @xcite .",
    "this problem can be overcome by wide sky coverage sc studies which become possible in the last decade as modern all sky surveys become available , such as the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , subsequent researches did not settle the issue and the variation in different studies is thought to come from the degeneracy between the structural parameters .",
    "moreover , the galactic structural parameters have been reported to show dependence on galactic longitude and latitude @xcite .",
    "this makes the measurement and interpretation far more complex and challenging .    to solve the degeneracy , information other than sc",
    "is needed , e.g. , dynamics , color , etc .",
    "the most handy tool is stellar color as it is available in all sky surveys .",
    "that is the reason why most sc studies come with color distribution ( cd ) , which calculates the number of star in each color bin .",
    "in addition to luminosity function ( lf ) and density profile ( dp ) used in single wavelength sc study , cd requires hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hr diagram ) to transform each luminous star into its corresponding color .",
    "hr diagram could be empirical ( i.e. , from observation ) or theoretical ( i.e. , from population syntheses ) . in the empirical case ,",

    "some of them ( e.g. , m67 and ngc6791 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which have information down to the faint end of ms , are used to conclude the important features for our analysis : ( 1 ) the ms - downturn @xmath55 is a common feature at the faint end of ms ; ( 2 ) the ms - turnoff ( i.e. , the slight upturn around late a star ) reflects stars departing from the ms at the end of their ms stage ; ( 3 ) the ms - turnoff always accompanies a @xmath56 mag vertical height extension and its @xmath51 color depends on the age of the star cluster ; and ( 4 ) the main sequence belt between the ms - turnoff and the ms - downturn is approximately linear . since only few gb stars are shown on these nir cmds , we are not able to get more details of the gb - curve .",
    "however , we believe that the location of the gb - curve should be similar to that of w92 and c07 .    accordingly , a working hr diagram includes the following features .",
    "the ms is divided into three parts : ( 1 ) early ms ( i.e. , o - a type stars and @xmath57 mag ) ; ( 2 ) nearly linear late ms ( i.e. , f - k type stars and @xmath58 mag ) ; and ( 3 ) sharp and almost vertical ms - downturn at @xmath55 ( i.e. , m type and later stars and @xmath59 mag ) .",
    "the gb is separated into up and low gbs .",
    "both are linear and connected by the gb - curve at @xmath60 and @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , we create an empirical @xmath40 against @xmath51 locus including a vertical ms - downturn , a linear late ms , a ms - turnoff with a @xmath61 mag vertical extension , a linear low gb , a linear up gb and a flat transition between the tip of the ms - turnoff and the low gb .",
    "the slopes of each linear part ( i.e. , the up gb , the low gb and the late ms ) and the connecting joints of different parts are taken from the cmds mentioned above and the data in w92 and c07 . the early ms is not included because the 2mass cds are generally deficient in number of stars in the region @xmath62 . since the @xmath0 colors of the red peak of 2mass cd is between 0.8 to 0.85 and that of the ms - downturns of m67 and ngc6791 are at @xmath63 @xcite , we set @xmath64 for the vertical ms - downturn .",
    "moreover , the middle peak is around @xmath65 to 0.6 and the gb - curves in w92 and c07 also have similar color , so we set @xmath66 for the gb - curve and let the low gb between @xmath67 and 0.6 . to incorporate the idea that different @xmath51 colors of the ms - turnoff for different evolutionary stage populations @xcite , we allow the ms - turnoff to move along the main sequence belt .",

    "we integrate the empirical locus ( fig .",
    "[ hrd ] ) with our milky way model mw - i to generate the synthetic cd . for reasonable good fit",
    ", the @xmath51 color of the thin disk and the thick disk are found to be 0.34 - 0.35 and 0.38 - 0.39 , respectively .",
    "the second column in fig .",
    "[ syntheticcd ] shows some results at different galactic latitudes .",
    "the result at medium and high galactic latitudes agrees well with the 2mass data .",
    "then , we inspect low galactic latitudes which have relatively small extinction .",
    "the result shows significant difference in the blue wing of the blue peak ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) , but the rest of the cd is still in a good agreement ( see the first row of the second column in fig .",
    "[ syntheticcd ] ) . if a bluer turnoff is assigned to the thin disk , the discrepancy in the blue wing can be compensated somewhat , but it will cause an over prediction in the blue wing and a shift in @xmath0 color of the blue peak at high galactic latitudes ( see the third column in fig .  [ syntheticcd ] ) .",
    "when experimenting parameters of the model in previous subsections , we notice a small scale height thin disk would make its blue peak change more dramatically along galactic latitude .",
    "this makes the overall blue peak ( i.e. , the thin and thick disks ) at low galactic latitudes be dominated by the thin disk , while the blue peak at medium and high galactic latitudes be dominated by the thick disk .",
    "therefore , a small scale height thin disk with a bluer ms - turnoff not only can eliminate the difference in the blue wing at low galactic latitudes , but also can reduce its contribution to the blue peak at medium and high galactic latitudes . in this way , the @xmath0 color of the blue peak could be relatively bluer at low galactic latitudes and relatively redder at the other sky region . with this strategy",

    "[ bridx ] along with the prediction of mw - ii .",
    "both figures have very similar trend which is relatively blue at low galactic latitudes and become comparable in other sky regions . the very red galactic disk is the result of severe extinction .",
    "when we inspect the galactic disk region ( i.e. , @xmath71 ) , the model prediction has obvious discrepancy with the 2mass cd . the discrepancy can mostly be attributed to improper extinction correction and number inconsistency between the model prediction and the 2mass data .",
    "the number inconsistency , which has been reported in @xcite , results in gaps on each peak between the model prediction and the 2mass cd .",
    "[ inconsist ] demonstrates some cases together with the sc results taken from @xcite . in these cases ,",

    "this helps us to delineate the discrepancy mainly comes from the number inconsistency ( see the difference in sc result , lower panels in fig .",

    "several examples of improper extinction correction are illustrated in the first column of fig .",
    "[ bluep ] .",
    "the improper extinction can make a significant offset on the @xmath0 colors of the blue and middle peaks and distort the shape of cd .",

    "each globular - cluster - only cd has a spike , which has @xmath0 color very similar to that of the extra peak in the whole field cd ( i.e. , the cd contains stars both from the globular cluster and the field ; solid line ) .",
    "we also obtain the cd of the ambient field ( dot - dashed line ) by subtracting the globular - cluster - only cd from the whole field cd .",
    "the extra peak does not show up anymore in the ambient field cd . besides , each globular cluster cmd has an obvious gb with an obscure gb - curve at @xmath75 similar to that on the empirical hr diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ hrd ] ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the extra peak is due to the low gb of the globular cluster and its significance depends on the relative amount of star in the low gb of the globular cluster to that in the ambient field . besides , if the limiting magnitude could be reached down to the ms - turnoff of the globular clusters , the observed blue peak would have more stars than the model prediction .",
    "similar number enhancement could happen in the 2mass cds if there is an overdensity within the field of view , which have a dominant stellar population over the smooth stellar distribution of the milky way ( e.g. , star cluster , stellar stream , galactic bulge , galactic arm , etc . ) .",
    "for instance , the extremely dense galactic bulge , which is not included in our model , makes a prominent middle peak on the 2mass cds , which obviously outnumbers the model prediction ( see the third column of fig .  [ bluep ] ) .",
    "however , we do not observe any obvious number enhancement in other 2mass cds which have known stellar streams in their field of view , e.g. , sagittarius dwarf galaxy @xcite , monoceros stream ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; table 1 ) , etc .",
    "it is possible that within the 2mass detection limit the populations of these overdensities are too small .    at low galactic latitudes",
    "there is another possible way to generate the middle peak .",
    "it is the red clump stars @xcite , which occupies the space close to the low gb on our hr diagram and has a higher number density relative to the other stars on gb . such relatively higher number density would produces more stars in the corresponding color bins . in our model",
    "we do not include the red clump stars in our lf and hr diagram , but our model still have good agreement with the 2mass cd .",
    "the reason might be the net contribution of the red clump stars in generating the middle peak is similar to that of the low gb .",
    "our best model that can explain the all sky 2mass cds ( see section  [ sec3 ] ) comprises a thin disk , which has a relative short scale height ( 260 pc ) and a relative blue ms - turnoff ( i.e. , younger ) , and a thick disk ( 1040 pc ) , which has a relative red ms - turnoff ( i.e. , older ) . our best model , mw - ii , that can explain the all sky 2mass cds ( see section  [ sec3 ] ) comprises a thin disk ( 260 pc ) with a relatively blue ms - turnoff ( 0.31 mag , i.e. , younger ) , and a thick disk ( 1040 pc ) with a relatively red ms - turnoff ( 0.38 mag , i.e. , older ) .",
    "the two populations can be interpreted in the context of the formation of the milky way .",
    "the thick disk was formed in an epoch earlier than the thin disk . moreover , both disks have the same single power law lf which implies that the initial mass function does not change along the milky way s evolution ( unless the mass - luminosity relation was time dependent in the past ) . in this sense",
    ", the all sky 2mass cds can be used as a tool to census the age of stellar population in the milky way .",

    "it is no doubt that the 2mass psc provides an unique tool to study the global property of the milky way , not only for its tremendous sky coverage ( which avoids the selection effect of limited sky coverage ) , but also for the benefits of using nir wavelength ( which keeps fine angular resolution and is less affected by interstellar extinction ) .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 color distribution ( cd ) with a bin size of 0.05 magnitude for the entire milky way has been carried out by using the two micron all sky survey point source catalog ( 2mass psc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cds are bimodal , which has a red peak at @xmath1 and a blue peak at @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . the colors of the red peak are more or less the same for the whole sky , but that of the blue peak depend on galactic latitude ( @xmath3 at low galactic latitudes and @xmath4 for other sky areas ) . </S>",
    "<S> the blue peak dominates the bimodal cds at low galactic latitudes and becomes comparable with the red peak in other sky regions . in order to explain the bimodal distribution and the global trend shown by the all sky 2mass cds , we assemble an empirical hr diagram , which is composed by observational - based near infrared hr diagrams and color magnitude diagrams , and incorporate a milky way model . in the empirical hr diagram , </S>",
    "<S> the main sequence stars turnoff of the thin disk is relatively bluer , @xmath5 , when we compare with the thick disk which is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the age of the thin / thick disk is roughly estimated to be around 4 - 5/8 - 9 gyr according to the color - age relation of the main sequence turnoff . in general , </S>",
