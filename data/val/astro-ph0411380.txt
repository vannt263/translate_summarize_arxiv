    "observations of the nearest and brightest active galaxies have inspired our current paradigm for the workings of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "their proximity gives superb spatial scale , which has been exploited in imaging with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ and in high - resolution radio observations .",
    "these same nearby agn have the highest s / n _ hst _ far - uv spectra , and the best high - resolution x - ray spectra . the spectral energy distribution of agn peaks in the far - ultraviolet wavelength range .",
    "thus , it is important for understanding the energy generation mechanism and the processes that govern accretion onto massive black holes .",
    "since this portion of the spectrum also determines the radiative input to the broad - line region ( blr ) and the narrow - line region ( nlr ) in agn , as well as the surrounding host galaxy and the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , determining its spectral shape is a crucial input for understanding the physical conditions of the gas in surrounding regions .",
    "the high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) enables us to study the astrophysics of the nearest agn in this crucial waveband .",
    "the 9001200   spectral range contains numerous diagnostic spectral features that can be applied to agn physics .",
    "the most prominent emission line is the o  vi resonance doublet @xmath0 , which is particularly strong in the spectra of low - redshift , low - luminosity agn due to the baldwin effect @xcite .",
    "this line can serve as a diagnostic of the energy input from the extreme ultraviolet to soft x - ray portions of the ionizing continuum .",
    "likewise , the o  vi doublet is a crucial diagnostic for the absorbing gas commonly seen as o  vii and o  viii absorption in x - ray spectra of agn ( @xcite ) , and as ly@xmath1 and c  iv absorption in _ hst _ spectra @xcite .",
    "the high - order lyman lines and the lyman limit provide additional diagnostics of absorbing gas . in some cases ( e.g. , ngc 4151 or ngc 3516 )",
    "the neutral hydrogen can be optically thick and thereby play a significant role in collimating the ionizing radiation that illuminates the nlr @xcite . finally , numerous ground - state transitions of molecular hydrogen in the lyman and werner bands provide a sensitive tracer of molecular gas . under the right circumstances",
    ", one might expect to see @xmath2 associated with the obscuring torus in agn in absorption against the continuum and broad emission lines .",
    "the ionizing continuum shape in agn is difficult to study directly . at low redshift",
    "it is mostly obscured by our own interstellar medium , and inferences must be made from the spectral shape observed in the far - uv and soft x - ray ( on either side of the opaque interstellar absorption ) as well as from clues provided by the emission lines observed .",
    "composite spectra assembled from _ hst _",
    "observations of moderate - redshift quasars ( @xcite ) show that the spectral energy distribution of agn peaks in the far - ultraviolet , with a distinct break at @xmath3  .",
    "the short wavelength response of _ fuse _ allows us to investigate the continuum properties of lower - redshift , lower - luminosity agn .",
    "we have used both the composite spectrum approach , and the detailed assembly of spectral energy distributions for 17 individual agn .",
    "@xcite obtained quasi - simultaneous observations of 17 agn using _ fuse _ , _ hst _ , and ground - based telescopes to produce spectral energy distributions covering 9129000   in the observed frame .",
    "a sampling of these spectra in figure [ uvosedfig ] shows that single power laws adequately describe the uv - optical continuum shape of roughly half the sample .",
    "many of the objects , however , show breaks in the spectral index at @xmath4  , similar to the _ hst _ composites .",
    "when we compare the uv - optical spectra with archival x - ray spectra ( figure [ xsedfig ] ) , one can see that the spectral energy distribution is clearly peaking in the far - ultraviolet . in most cases ,",
    "the objects in the @xcite sample have an x - ray spectral slope and normalization matching the extrapolation of the fuv continuum .",
    "these individual seds are broadly consistent with modern accretion - disk models .",
    "geometrically thin disk models with non - lte atmospheres @xcite predict a narrow distribution of power - law indices for disk spectra on the red side of the peak in the sed .",
    "these models peak in the far - ultraviolet , with a spectral break or bump near the lyman limit .",
    "spectral indices shortward of the break have a broader distribution . as shown in figure [ admodsfig ] the 17 agn from @xcite have roughly similar distributions of spectral indices compared to the models .    with the same technique used to create the _ hst _ composite agn spectra , we have constructed a composite _ fuse _ spectrum from 128 observations of 85 distinct agn @xcite . as shown in figure [ compositefig ] ,",
    "the _ fuse _ composite ( @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) is bluer than the _ hst _ composite ( @xmath7 ) , it shows no evidence for a break in the spectral index in the far - ultraviolet , and it has significantly stronger ne  viii and o  vi emission .    in an effort to understand these properties in more detail , we examined the spectral indices of individual objects in the sample . as found by @xcite",
    ", some individual objects do show breaks in their spectrum , but , in general , the _ fuse _ agn are lower luminosity and bluer than individual _ hst _ agn .",
    "the left panel of figure [ baldwinfig ] shows a significant anticorrelation between the agn spectral index and its luminosity .",
    "we interpret this in the context of an accretion disk around the central black hole in the following manner  lower - luminosity agn are likely to have less massive black holes , and hence hotter accretion disks .",
    "this shifts the peak of their spectral energy distributions to shorter wavelengths , moving the spectral break out of the _ fuse _ bandpass and making their spectra bluer .",
    "this physical interpretation may also explain the baldwin effect .",
    "the bluer spectra will have more high - energy photons , leading to relatively more emission from highly ionized species such as c  iv , o  vi , and ne  viii .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure [ baldwinfig ] , o  vi emission in the _ fuse _ sample shows a strong anticorrelation with luminosity .",
    "as of november 1 , 2002 , _ fuse _ spectra for a total of 104 agn were present in the archive .",
    "four of these are type 2 agn , and the rest are type 1 .",
    "two of the type 2 agn show strong , narrow emission lines ( ngc  1068 and mrk  477 ) , and the other two have stellar continua typical of starburst galaxies .",
    "53 of the type 1 agn have @xmath8 , so that the o  vi doublet is visible in the _ fuse _ band .",
    "as shown earlier in figure [ baldwinfig ] , all of these agn have strong , broad o  vi emission .",
    "surprisingly , roughly a third of these ( 17/53 ) also show strong _ narrow _ o  vi emission .",
    "emission from c  iii @xmath9 and n  iii @xmath10 is common , as is a bump of blended emission lines on the red wing of o  vi . in narrow - line seyfert",
    "1 galaxies such as i  zw  1 , this bump is resolved into emission from s  iv @xmath11 and he  ii @xmath12 .    as shown in the left panel of figure [ abshistfig ] ,",
    "absorption is common at all luminosities , and over 50% ( 30 of 53 ) of the low - redshift type 1 agn observed using _ fuse _ show detectable o  vi absorption , comparable to those seyferts that show longer - wavelength uv @xcite or x - ray @xcite absorption .",
    "none show intrinsic @xmath2 absorption .",
    "we see three basic morphologies for o  vi absorption lines : ( 1 ) * single * : 13 of 30 objects exhibit single , narrow , isolated o  vi absorption lines , as illustrated by the spectrum of ton  s180 @xcite .",
    "pg0804 + 761 , shown in the top panel of figure [ spectrafig ] , is another example .",
    "( 2 ) * blend * : multiple o  vi absorption components that are blended together .",
    "10 of 30 objects fall in this class , and the spectrum of mrk  279 is typical @xcite .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ spectrafig ] shows mrk  478 as another example .",
    "( 3 ) * smooth * : the 7 objects here are an extreme expression of the  blend \" class , where the o  vi absorption is so broad and blended that individual o  vi components can not be identified .",
    "ngc  4151 typifies this class @xcite .",
    "the mini - bal qso pg1411 + 442 is another example of this class , shown in the bottom panel of figure [ spectrafig ] .",
    "individual o  vi absorption components in our spectra have fwhm of 50750 @xmath13 , with most objects having fwhm @xmath14 .",
    "the multiple components that are typically present are almost always blue shifted , and they span a velocity range of 2004000 @xmath13 ; half the objects span a range of @xmath15 .",
    "as shown in the right panel of figure [ abshistfig ] , the maximum outflow velocities show a tendency to increase with source luminosity , perhaps indicating that radiative acceleration plays some role in the dynamics . note also that there is a population of low - velocity absorbers present at all luminosities .",
    "the absorption lines we see in our spectra of agn are associated with mass outflows from the active nucleus .",
    "these outflows can profoundly affect the evolution of the central engine @xcite , the host galaxy and its interstellar medium @xcite and also the surrounding intergalactic medium ( igm ) @xcite .",
    "winds from the high metal - abundance nuclear regions may be a significant source for enriching the igm @xcite .",
    "absorption by the outflow can also collimate the ionizing radiation @xcite and thereby influence the ionization structure of the host galaxy and the surrounding igm .",
    "the outflowing gas in agn is sometimes visible as extended , bi - conical emission at visible or x - ray wavelengths ( e.g. , ngc 4151 , @xcite , @xcite ; ngc 1068 , @xcite ) , but it most frequently manifests itself as blue - shifted absorption features in their uv and x - ray spectra .",
    "about half of all low - redshift agn show x - ray absorption by highly ionized gas @xcite , and a similar fraction show associated uv absorption in ionized species such as c  iv @xcite and o  vi @xcite . in more luminous quasars , the fraction of objects in the sloan digital sky survey that shows broad c  iv absorption troughs rises steeply as the troughs become narrower @xcite , comprising over 30% of the quasar population at widths narrower than 1000 @xmath13 . for agn that have been observed in both the x - ray and the uv , there is a one - to - one correspondence between objects showing x - ray and uv absorption , implying that the phenomena are related in some way ( crenshaw et al .",
    "the high frequency of occurrence of uv and x - ray absorption suggests that the absorbing gas has a high covering fraction , and that it is present in all agn .",
    "the gas has a total mass exceeding @xmath16 ( greater than the broad - line region , or blr ) , and is outflowing at a rate @xmath17 ( @xmath18 the accretion rate in some objects ) @xcite . in an effort to understand agn outflows better , _ fuse _",
    "guest investigators have been successful in coordinating several campaigns on bright agn with simultaneous _",
    "hst _ and x - ray observations of ngc  3783 , ngc  5548 , ngc  4051 , ngc  4151 , ark  564 , mrk  279 , and ngc  7469 .",
    "* doublet ratios for the o  vi absorption lines show that the absorbers can be optically thick , but they are not black at line center . thus column densities are frequently underestimated , sometimes by as much as an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "* variations in the absorption line strength can reflect either an ionization response , or bulk motion @xcite .",
    "* in the extensive recent _ chandra / fuse / hst _ campaign on ngc 3783 @xcite , the kinematics of the x - ray absorbing gas provide a good match to the uv - absorbing gas .",
    "the x - ray absorbing gas itself contains material spanning a large range of ionization parameters @xcite , and it is likely that this broad range of physical conditions can also include the uv - absorbing ions .",
    "this is a natural prediction of the thermally driven wind model of @xcite , and would also be likely in disk - driven winds . * in other cases the uv gas visible in _ fuse _",
    "spectra appears to be in a fairly low ionization state , and there is no direct relation between the x - ray absorption and the multiple kinematic components seen in the uv ( ngc  5548 : @xcite ; mrk  509 : @xcite ; ngc  7469 : @xcite ) .",
    "the multiple kinematic components frequently seen in the uv absorption spectra of agn clearly show that the absorbing medium is complex , with separate uv and x - ray dominant zones . in some cases",
    ", the uv absorption component corresponding to the x - ray warm absorber can be clearly identified , such as ngc  3783 ( @xcite ) . in others , however , _ no _ uv absorption component shows physical conditions characteristic of those seen in the x - ray absorber as in ngc  5548 ( @xcite ) .",
    "one potential geometry for this complex absorbing structure is high - density , low - column uv - absorbing clouds embedded in a low - density , high - ionization medium that dominates the x - ray absorption .",
    "disk - driven winds are a possible explanation for some cases of agn outflows @xcite .",
    "by analogy to stellar winds , one would expect the terminal velocity of an agn outflow to reflect the gravity of its origin .",
    "disk - driven winds should therefore have velocities in the range of several thousand @xmath13 .",
    "objects with broad , smooth profiles might fall in this category .",
    "the geometry proposed by @xcite suggests that these objects should have only modest inclinations .",
    "however , two prime examples of seyferts with broad smooth absorption troughs , ngc 3516 @xcite and ngc 4151 @xcite , are likely the highest inclination sources in our sample given their extended , bi - conical narrow emission - line region morphologies @xcite and their opaque lyman limits @xcite .",
    "the lower velocities we observe in objects like ngc 3783 and ngc 5548 are more compatible with thermally driven winds from the obscuring torus @xcite . in these thermally driven winds , photoionized evaporation in the presence of a copious mass source ( the torus ) locks the ratio of ionizing intensity to total gas pressure ( the ionization parameter @xmath19 ) at a critical value . for agn spectral energy distributions lacking a strong extreme ultraviolet bump , such as the composite spectra of quasars assembled by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the ionization equilibrium curve exhibits an extensive vertical branch .",
    "thus , at the critical ionization parameter for evaporation , there is a broad range of temperatures that can coexist in equilibrium at nearly constant pressure . for this reason",
    ", the flow is expected to be strongly inhomogeneous .",
    "outflow velocities are typical of the sound speed in the heated gas , or several hundred @xmath13 , comparable to the velocities seen in many agn .    in summary , we find that o  vi absorption is common in low - redshift ( @xmath8 ) agn .",
    "30 of 53 type 1 agn with @xmath8 observed using _ fuse _ show multiple , blended o  vi absorption lines with typical widths of @xmath20 that are blueshifted over a velocity range of @xmath21 1000 @xmath13 .",
    "those galaxies in our sample with existing x - ray or longer wavelength uv observations also show c  iv absorption and evidence of a soft x - ray warm absorber .",
    "in some cases , a uv absorption component has physical properties similar to the x - ray absorbing gas , but in others there is no clear physical correspondence between the uv and x - ray absorbing components .",
    "i thank all the members of the _ fuse _ agn working group for their contributions to this research , especially jennifer scott and zhaohui shang .",
    "this work is based on data obtained for the guaranteed time team by the nasa - cnes - csa fuse mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
    "financial support to u. s. participants has been provided by nasa contract nas5 - 32985 ."
