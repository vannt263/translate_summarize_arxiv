    ", the quaternion was separated into the scalar and vector parts . in his studies ,",
    "j. c. maxwell mingled the quaternion analysis and vector terminology to depict electromagnetic properties in 1873 .",
    "presently some scholars apply the vector terminology to depict the physical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields , while some scholars begin to study the electromagnetic theory @xcite and gravitational theory @xcite with the algebra of quaternions .    graves and cayley invented independently the octonions , which can be considered as an ordered couple of quaternions .",

    "_ adopted the tensor analysis and pseudo - riemannian space theory to study the gravitational properties in the curved four - space - time .",
    "subsequently the quaternion and octonion curved spaces are applied to investigate physical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields in some situations .",

    "there are mainly three description methods as follows :    \\1 ) curved four - space - time . within the general theory of relativity in 1915 , einstein introduced the method of pseudo - riemannian space to study gravitational properties in the curved four - space - time .",
    "later some scholars attempt to apply the pseudo - riemannian space to explore various properties of gravitational field , and even the electromagnetic field . but this method is not successful in depicting convincingly the physical property of electromagnetic field .",
    "\\2 ) real octonion curved space .",
    "some scholars described the physical properties of the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the flat space , by means of the real quaternion / octonion flat space .",
    "however this method was found to be inadequate finally @xcite . and it is not suitable to describe the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the curved space either , making use of the real quaternion / octonion curved space .",
    "one reason is that the definition of the arc length for this space deviates from the space - time interval in the physics .",
    "\\3 ) complex octonion curved space .",
    "the complex quaternion / octonion flat space is able to depict the physical property of gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the flat space .",
    "some scholars research gravitational and electromagnetic properties in the curved space , depending on the complex quaternion / octonion curved space .",
    "on the basis of the locally tangent frame and tensor analysis , the paper can explore the characteristics of complex quaternion / octonion curved space .",

    "the study reveals that the definition of the arc length for this space is identical with the space - time interval in the physics .",
    "the connection coefficient and curvature of the complex quaternion / octonion curved space , which are similar to the field strength and source , will exert an influence on the object s movement to a certain extent , no matter what kind of reason it is to result in the space curving evidently . on the contrary ,",
    "measuring the field strength and source relevant to the gravitational and electromagnetic fields , one may be able to ascertain the deviation amplitude between the complex quaternion / octonion curved space and its flat space .    making use of the comparison",
    ", the paper found that the four - dimensional riemannian space corresponds to the four - dimensional euclidean space . but both of them are not suitable to be applied to describe directly the physical properties of gravitational or electromagnetic field .",
    "the four - dimensional pseudo - riemannian space corresponds to the four - dimensional pseudo - euclidean space ( or minkowski space , four - space - time ) , and is appropriate for describing gravitational properties in the general theory of relativity .",
    "similarly the real quaternion / octonion curved space corresponds to the four - dimensional riemannian space , and is unsuitable to depict directly the physical property of gravitational or electromagnetic field either .",
    "in contrast , the complex quaternion / octonion curved space corresponds to the four - dimensional pseudo - riemannian space , and is fit for researching the gravitational and electromagnetic properties . on the basis of this curved space ,",
    "the paper will study various properties of gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the complex quaternion / octonion curved space , including the field potential , field strength , field source , linear momentum , angular momentum , torque , and force and so forth .      in the curved four - space - time of the general theory of relativity , the scholars delved into the gravitational theory @xcite , attaining many scientific achievements .",
    "but there are still a few things to worry about .",
    "\\1 ) astrophysical jets .",
    "the scholars have being doubted the validity and relevant deductions of etvs experiment for a long time @xcite .",
    "they not only inspect the etvs experiment in the laboratory again and again @xcite , but also measure repeatedly the gravitational constant in the astronomical observatory @xcite .",
    "one recent theoretical result points out that the etvs experiment has never been validated under the strong electromagnetic circumstance , suspecting that the gravitational mass may be varied with fluctuation of electromagnetic strength .",
    "further the variable gravitational mass is able to explain the phenomenon of astrophysical jets @xcite , which is the defeat for the classical gravitational theory or the general theory of relativity .",
    "up to the present , this suspicion is an ongoing process , and the answer has not been concluded yet .",
    "obviously the query on the changeability of gravitational mass will impact further the theoretical basis of the general theory of relativity .",
    "the appeal of improving the general theory of relativity is gradually deepening and expanding .",
    "this open opinion provides one approach to develop the general theory of relativity .",
    "\\2 ) dark matter .",
    "an abundance of astronomical observational results reveal that there are a large amount of undetected matters in the galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "but the classical gravitational theory and the general theory of relativity can not account for the existence of undetected matters .",
    "obviously these two existing theories both are not perfect enough . nowadays",
    "the scholars mainly develop two kinds of investigations for this problem . on the one hand ,",
    "some scholars propose to modify the laws of gravity established by i. newton and a. einstein ( such as mond ) , attempting to explain the anomalous observations . but this method can not account for the properties of galaxy clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "some scholars introduce the concept of ` dark matter ' , explaining the rotational velocity curves of galaxies and the gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters .",
    "all of these endeavors state that the classical gravitational theory and the general theory of relativity both may encounter the puzzling impediment , which may be very tough to overcome .",
    "\\3 ) curved space .",
    "the human being often breaks into exclamations of wonder of scientific laws , even if we are not able to comprehend why the scientific laws are so intriguing .",
    "fortunately the human being possesses the ability to suppose , measure , and describe the particular contents of scientific laws to a certain extent .",
    "in other words , ` the reason for the existence of scientific laws ' and ` the specific contents of scientific laws ' are two disparate topics .",
    "similarly the human being may not understand why the space is curved when we are in a curved space , although the scholars are able to measure and describe the bending degree of one space .",
    "if we find the reason why a space is flat , we may know why other spaces are curved .",
    "therefore ` the reason to curve the space ' and ` the bending degree of the curved space ' are two distinct topics , they should be treated discriminatively .",
    "einstein tried to uncover why the space is curved under certain circumstances , in the general theory of relativity .",
    "however this paper involves in one distinct topic , and focuses on describing the possible influence of the bending degree of curved space on some equations of the field theory .",
    "the analysis in the above reveals that the concept , viewpoint , and experiment relevant to the curved space are evolving constantly and gradually , along with the development of science and technology . for the general theory of relativity",
    ", it may be necessary to have a fundamental rethink of existing concepts appropriately , and even supplement a few new results .",
    "\\1 ) distorting the result of the etvs experiment .",
    "the general theory of relativity reckons subjectively that the gravitational mass is unchangeable , and does not contemplate the influence of the energy gradient ( that is , one force term ) on some other experiments @xcite .",
    "however some theories deduce that the gravitational mass may be varied with fluctuation of field strength and so forth .",
    "it results in the gravitational mass to depart from the inertial mass with a deviation .",
    "the energy gradient relevant to the gravitational or electromagnetic strength will act on the etvs experiment .",
    "therefore it is necessary to validate the etvs experiment under the strong electromagnetic circumstance .",
    "\\2 ) surmising the reason for curving the space . as a pioneer ,",
    "einstein broke fresh ground in the field theory , that is , the curved space .",
    "this theory surmises subjectively that the curvature tensor is directly proportional to the energy - momentum tensor , deducing the field equations .",
    "however the field equations should be verified continually in the experiment .",
    "the field equations are doubtful , and call for more collateral evidences to support its claim .",
    "you can even guess that there may be more than one reason to curve the space .",
    "\\3 ) origin of mass .",
    "this is one topic that the general theory of relativity has never been touched on . at present",
    "a few scholars are engaging in some projects to figure out the origin and component of the mass .",
    "undoubtedly this is one underlying challenge for some propositions in the general theory of relativity .    in a word ,",
    "the paper will focus on studying the influence of curved space on the physical quantity , rather than try to find out the reason why the space is curved in the physics , by means of the affine frame of complex octonion curved space .",
    "in this paper , it is necessary to introduce the tangent - frame component , @xmath1 , of one point @xmath2 in the curved space , in order to define the component of a physics quantity in the curved coordinate system .",
    "and the tangent frame system @xmath3 belongs to the affine frame . in general the tangent - frame components are neither equal - length , nor perpendicular to each other . for the pseudo - riemannian space in the general theory of relativity ,",
    "the tangent - frame component may be a vector or a scalar . in the quaternion or octonion curved space , the tangent - frame component , @xmath1",
    ", may be the quaternion or octonion respectively .",
    "@xmath4 .    in the physics ,",
    "the most common coordinate systems are orthogonal and even orthonormal , to give prominence to the physical contents and lower down the degree of difficulty of the mathematics in the physics theories .",
    "that is , not all affine frames are suitable to be chosen as the curved coordinate system , for the gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the curved space . and",
    "it is essential to demarcate and filter out the appropriate affine frames further .",
    "when we study the physics quantity and relevant properties in the curved space , it is proper to stipulate to choose the orthogonal affine frame ( or the orthogonal curved coordinate system ) , for the sake of reducing the correlative mathematical difficulty ( such as , the metric tensor and invariants ) . on the other hand , the physics quantity in the orthogonal affine frame can be transformed into one in an orthogonal and equal - length affine frame , in order to draw a comparison between the physics quantity in the flat space ( see ref.[9 ] ) with that in the tangent space of the curved space .    according to this arrangement",
    ", the gravitational and electromagnetic theories can be extended from the flat space into the curved space .",
    "firstly , transform the gravitational and electromagnetic theories in the flat space into that under the orthogonal and equal - length affine frame of the tangent space in the curved space ; secondly , transform the gravitational and electromagnetic theories in the orthogonal and equal - length affine frame into that in the orthogonal affine frame ; thirdly , in the orthogonal affine frame , study the influence of the curved space on the force and so forth in the gravitational and electromagnetic fields .    in the curved space , the physics quantity will contain several parameters of the curved space .",
    "a ) the integrating function , @xmath5 , of field potential can be chosen as the first - rank tensor , and then the field potential , @xmath6 , as the first covariant derivative of @xmath5 , will contain the connection coefficient . as the second covariant derivative , the field strength , @xmath7 , may contain the connection coefficient and curvature tensor . as the third covariant derivative , the field source , @xmath8 , will contain the connection coefficient , curvature tensor , and curvature derivative .",
    "b ) if the field potential , @xmath6 , is chosen as the first - rank tensor , the field strength , @xmath7 , as the first covariant derivative of @xmath6 , will contain the connection coefficient .",
    "as the second covariant derivative , the field source , @xmath8 , may contain the connection coefficient and curvature tensor .",
    "c ) when the angular momentum , @xmath9 , is chosen as the first - rank tensor , the torque , @xmath10 , as the first covariant derivative of @xmath9 , will contain the connection coefficient .",
    "as the second covariant derivative , the force , @xmath11 , may contain the connection coefficient and curvature tensor .",
    "it should be noted that three different first - rank tensors in the above may not be in the same tangent frame or curved space .    in a similar way",
    ", the acceleration , @xmath12 , can be chosen as the first - rank tensor , and then the jerk , @xmath13 , as the first covariant derivative of @xmath12 , will contain the connection coefficient . as the second covariant derivative",
    ", the jounce , @xmath14 , may contain the connection coefficient and curvature tensor . of course",
    ", as one first - rank tensor , the curved space relevant to the acceleration , @xmath12 , may be different from that relevant to these three first - rank tensors in the above .",
    "obviously the covariant derivative of a physics quantity may include a few parameters of the curved space . comparing the physics quantity in the curved space with that in the flat space",
    ", we are able to distinguish different bending degrees of the curved space . contrasting several sets of measured values of physics quantities will conclude the bending degree of a curved space .",
    "under an orthogonal transformation of the coordinate system with the complex quaternions , the norm of the complex quaternions remains unchanged .",
    "the norm ( or the arc length ) is identical to the space - time interval in the physics , and is able to be applied to describe the gravitational field equations in the complex quaternion curved space .    apparently , in the complex quaternion",
    "curved space , the underlying space is the quaternion space , and the tangent space is the quaternion space also . making use of the complex quaternion orthogonality and affine frame , it is able to define the quaternion metric and covariant derivative , studying the gravitational properties in the complex quaternion curved space .      in the complex quaternion flat space ,",
    "the complex quaternion radius vector is , @xmath15 , with the basis vector being @xmath16 . according to the multiplication of quaternion , the norm @xmath0 is written as , @xmath17 .",
    "obviously the differential , @xmath18 , of the norm is able to be chosen as the arc length of the complex quaternion ( rather than the real - quaternion ) flat space . and that this norm accords with the requirement of space - time interval in the physics .",

    "one reason is that the spaces associated with in the physics are not only the complex quaternion flat space ( tangent space ) but also the pseudo - riemannian space ( curved space ) .",
    "therefore it is necessary to introduce one new concept of parallel translation .",
    "it is similar to the levi - civita parallel translation , and is able to satisfy the requirement of the complex quaternion space and of the space - time interval .    in a complex quaternion space ,",
    "when the quaternion product of two complex quaternions , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , equals to zero , that is , @xmath48 , the two quaternions , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , are perpendicular to each other .",

    "from the following basic postulates @xcite , the algebra of quaternions / octonions can be introduced into the field theory , describing some physical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields .    the first postulate : individual space .",
    "the space extended from the electromagnetic field is independent to one from the gravitational field . according to the viewpoint of descartes _",
    "_ , the fundamental field ( electromagnetic or gravitational field ) is an irreducible element of physical description , while the space is only the extension of the fundamental field and does not claim existence on its own .",
    "further each fundamental field extends its individual space .",
    "these spaces are quite similar but independent to each other .    the second postulate : quaternion space .",
    "each space extended respectively from the fundamental field can be chosen as the quaternion space . according to the viewpoint of hamilton _",
    "_ , the space in the physics can be chosen as the quaternion space .",
    "two spaces , extended from the electromagnetic and gravitational fields respectively , can be considered as the quaternion spaces perpendicular to each other , so that they can combine together to become an octonion space .",
    "consequently the octonion space can be applied to describe the physical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "the third postulate : dimensional homogeneity .",
    "it is necessary to introduce a few coefficients to maintain the dimensional homogeneity for all of physical quantities in each equation . in order to maintain the dimensional homogeneity ,",
    "the physical quantity of electromagnetic field should be multiplied by a coefficient , when there are simultaneously physical quantities of electromagnetic and gravitational fields in an octonion equation .",
    "the coefficient can be determined by comparing with the classical theories relevant to the electromagnetic and gravitational fields .",
    "the complex quaternion and octonion both are the first - rank tensors , according to the definition of tensor .",
    "consequently it is possible to apply the tensor analysis to study various properties of complex octonion curved space , and the influence of curved space on physical quantities of gravitational and electromagnetic fields .",
    "the complex octonion manifold is an indefinite geometric object , and its geometric structure is quite meager .",
    "a sole geometric property is that it is allowed to establish a coordinate system in the manifold , and transform the coordinate system with a continuous - differential function .    in the complex octonion manifold , it is possible to define the connection among different tensors in contiguous points , enabling the complex octonion manifold to become an affine connection space . in the paper , the torsion tensor of affine connection space",
    "is chosen to be zero .",
    "it means that the connection coefficient , @xmath167 , is symmetric about the subscripts , @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "that is , @xmath167 = @xmath170 .",
    "apparently the coordinate value , connection coefficient , and octonion metric are all scalar , according to eqs.(1 ) , ( 2 ) , ( 8) , and ( 9 ) , in the orthogonal affine frame system of the complex octonion curved space .    after introducing the connection , @xmath167",
    ", we can define the parallel translation now .",
    "the parallel translation is one geometric property irrespective of the choice of coordinate system .",
    "let us transfer a complex octonion quantity , @xmath171 , from a point @xmath55 to the next point @xmath57 , requiring the quantity @xmath172 to remain unchanged .",
    "it means that the differential of quantity @xmath172 equals to zero .",
    "therefore , @xmath173 or @xmath174 while the following term in the above can be extended into , @xmath175    substituting the above in eq.(b.2 ) yields the condition of parallel translation for the complex octonion quantity @xmath172 , @xmath176 and then , according to the property which the differential of a scalar equals to zero , @xmath177 , one can obtain the equation of covariant component , @xmath178    further we can define the complex octonion metric in the affine connection space , achieving the complex octonion curved space , in possession of the parallel translation and metric .",
    "there is a certain relationship between the connection with metric . and that the definition of metric must meet the demand of this relationship in the affine connection space .",
    "multiplying eq.(b.3 ) by the basis vector , @xmath179 , from the left side can yield , @xmath180 while multiplying the octonion conjugate of eq.(b.3 ) by the basis vector , @xmath181 , from the right side produces , @xmath182 where @xmath183 . according to the octonion - hermitian of metric , there is , @xmath184 , with @xmath185^t = ( g_{\\lambda \\overline{\\alpha } } ) ^t = g_{\\overline{\\alpha } \\lambda } $ ] .",
