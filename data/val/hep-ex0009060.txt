    "at the neutrino 94 conference in eilat , israel , the title of the summary talk on atmospheric neutrinos @xcite was : `` is there an atmospheric neutrino anomaly ? '' .",
    "already then , b.c .",
    "barish concluded that `` it seems strongly indicative that the anomaly is indeed real , and that it is due to a deficit in the number of observed muon neutrinos . ''",
    "this conclusion was beautifully confirmed by the presentation of `` evidence for @xmath0 oscillations '' by super - kamiokande @xcite in takayama , japan , 4 years later @xcite , implying the disappearance of muon neutrinos into some other neutrino flavour .    in the two flavour approximation ,",
    "the survival probability for muon neutrinos in vacuum can be expressed by the well known oscillation formula @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the distance travelled in km , @xmath7 is the neutrino energy in gev , @xmath8 is the neutrino mixing angle , and @xmath9 is the difference of the mass square eigenvalues expressed in ev@xmath10 .",
    "this simple relation could be modified by a contribution of additional flavours , and by matter effects @xcite which depend on the neutrino flavour .",
    "oscillations into @xmath11 are the currently preferred hypothesis . a large contribution of oscillations into @xmath12 is excluded by the chooz reactor results @xcite , and recent indications from super - kamiokande strongly disfavour pure @xmath13 oscillations @xcite .",
    "hybrid oscillations into both @xmath11 and @xmath14 , and a small contribution of @xmath3 oscillations are however still allowed @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the limited l / e resolution , exotic alternatives to the oscillation hypothesis such as neutrino decay @xcite , large extra dimensions @xcite or neutrino decoherence @xcite remain fully valid explanations @xcite .    over the last few years",
    ", an impressive effort has been made towards the further clarification of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly with the help of long baseline neutrino beams in japan @xcite , the us @xcite and europe @xcite .",
    "this program is starting to yield first results @xcite . here",
    ", we would like to present the case why these measurements need to be complemented by further , more precise atmospheric neutrino measurements , and how these measurements can be achieved .",
    "atmospheric neutrino experiments offer several advantages over currently operational or planned long baseline neutrino beam programs .    * a very large @xmath15 range ( from about 1 km / gev to 10@xmath16 km / gev ; a typical long baseline beam covers only one or two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "therefore , a very large range of oscillation parameters can be studied simultaneously . * two identical sources for a single detector : a near ( downgoing neutrinos ) and a far ( upgoing neutrinos ) one .",
    "* for some of the measurements , e.g. the confirmation of the oscillation pattern , there is currently no alternative to atmospheric neutrino detectors if the atmospheric @xmath9 is low .",
    "the pattern measurement is sensitive to test and exclude alternative explanations and is competitive to long baseline studies even at high @xmath9 .",
    "* during the next decade large matter effects with high energy neutrinos can only be observed in atmospheric neutrino experiments , since the current long baseline distances are too short for a significant effect .",
    "the measurement of the presence or absence of such effects can significantly constrain complicated hybrid oscillation models .",
    "the measurement of a difference in the neutrino and antineutrino oscillation parameters might allow the measurement of the sign of @xmath9 , i.e. the neutrino mass hierarchy ( matter effects are expected to dominate over cp violation effects ) .",
    "most future detectors able to make significant contributions to the detection of atmospheric neutrinos are multi - purpose detectors which also cover many other physics topics , like the detection of neutrinos from long baseline beams , detection of solar neutrinos , supernova neutrinos , and nucleon decay , or the study of cosmic ray muons and other astrophysics topics .",
    "the reference against which future improvements should be evaluated is given by the results of super - kamiokande @xcite , a 50 kt ( 23 kt fiducial ) water cherenkov detector .",
    "some of the atmospheric neutrino measurements ( e.g. @xmath11/@xmath17 separation ) are still statistically limited , and could be improved by extending the super - kamiokande concept to a larger detector mass .",
    "[ fig : uno ]    the concept of a 650 kt ( 450 kt fiducial ) water cherenkov detector , tentatively called uno @xcite ( ultra underground nucleon decay and neutrino observatory detector ) , is currently being discussed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uno ] ) .",
    "it would be subdivided into three cubic compartments of @xmath18 m@xmath19 .",
    "the walls of the central compartment would be equipped with photomultipliers `` a la super - k '' , to be fully sensistive also to low energy ( mev ) neutrinos .",
    "a less dense photomultiplier coverage is forseen for the two outer compartments , dedicated to higher energy events .",
    "apart from super - k - like measurements with 20-fold increased statistics , the @xmath20 production rate from @xmath1 oscillations might be large enough in such a detector to extract an explicit @xmath20 appearance signal from atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
    "optionally , an external muon momentum and charge identifier could be addeed .",
    "[ fig : aqua ]    a different detector concept , based on the ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) technique , is envisaged by the aqua - rich project @xcite .",
    "this project is currently in the r&d phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aqua ] ) .",
    "two spherical detector structures equipped with hybrid photo - detectors ( hpd s ) are immersed into a large water tank ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aqua ] ) .",
    "the upper part of this tank is used as a shield against low energy cosmic rays .",
    "the inner surface of the outer sphere is equipped as a mirror to focus the cherenkov light onto the outer surface of the inner sphere . this inner sphere ( dome )",
    "is densely covered with hpd s to detect the focused cherenkov rings .",
    "in addition , the mirror sphere is sparsely equipped with additional hpd s to also directly detect the non - focused cherenkov light .",
    "a fiducial mass of 1 mt is envisaged for this project .    while the mirror hpd s can be used to reconstruct the neutrino interaction vertex and the particle flight direction , the space - time structure of the ring image on the dome hpd s yields a measurement of the particle momentum through multiple scattering . a momentum resolution of 7%",
    "can be achieved @xcite .",
    "this yields an l / e resolution which is good enough to resolve the sinusoidal oscillation pattern @xcite over the complete super - kamiokande allowed range .",
    "the water detectors discussed above have the advantage of a very large mass , and therefore large statistics , but two main drawbacks .",
    "the time scale for their realization spans at least 10 years , and the implementation of a magnetic field ( if any ) to measure the muon charge is complicated and costly .",
    "a different detector concept is being followed using large magnetised tracking calorimeters .",
    "the advantage of such detectors is that they can easily measure the muon charge , and therefore separate the neutrino and antineutrino components . in the context of atmospheric neutrinos , this is very useful to study matter effects , which can be significantly different in the two cases .",
    "furthermore , the energy of the hadronic system and the momentum of semi - contained muons can be measured .",
    "this yields a good reconstruction of the neutrino energy up to the highest energies . at these energies",
    "the neutrino angular resolution , which determines the resolution on l , is also good .",
    "hence , very good l / e resolution can be obtained @xcite , which is needed to resolve the oscillation pattern .",
    "two such detectors , the approved minos detector at fermilab @xcite and the noe part of the proposed icanoe detector at gran sasso @xcite , have been primarily designed as long baseline beam detectors .",
    "they are described in other contributions to this conference @xcite .",
    "their small fiducial mass ( 3.5 kt or less ) severely limits the statistics , and therefore their potential contribution to atmospheric neutrino measurements .",
    "monolith ( massive observatory for neutrino oscillations or limits on their existence ) , a 34 kt magnetised iron detector dedicated to the measurement of atmospheric neutrinos in the gran sasso lab in italy , has been officially proposed this summer @xcite",
    ". its fiducial mass of about 26 kt matches the mass of super - kamiokande , while its superior l / e resolution allows the reconstruction of the oscillation pattern .",
    "the detector consists of two modules with dimensions of @xmath21 m@xmath19 each ( fig .",
    "[ fig : modetect ] ) .",
    "each module is made of 125 horizontal iron layers ( 8 cm thick ) interleaved with active planes of glass spark counters ( glass rpc s ) , and surrounded by external scintillation counters to help reducing the background from cosmic ray muons .",
    "a magnetic field of 1.3 t , fully contained within the iron plates , is applied .",
    "optionally , and end cap of vertical planes could improve the performance for auxiliary measurements in the cern to gran sasso beam .",
    "if approved promptly , the experiment could start data taking towards the end of 2004 .",
    "finally , a similar detector concept is also discussed in the context of a 50 kt detector for a future neutrino factory @xcite .",
    "such a detector would have a performance on atmospheric neutrinos similar to monolith , but with a larger mass , and on a longer timescale .",
    "liquid argon time projection chambers ( tpc s ) are a further technique well suited to the detection of atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "their advantage with respect to massive iron detectors is their sensitivity to both electron and muon neutrinos down to the lowest possible energies for atmospheric neutrinos , and their sensitivity to @xmath20 appearance .",
    "their disadvantage is the much higher price per kton .",
    "the proposed icanoe detector @xcite , combining a 7.6 kt ( 5.6 kt fiducial ) liquid argon tpc ( icarus , split into 4 modules ) with a 3.2 kt iron calorimeter ( noe ) , is described in a separate contribution to this conference @xcite .",
    "this detector is designed both for the detection of @xmath11 and @xmath12 appearance in the cern to gran sasso neutrino beam @xcite and for the detection of atmospheric neutrinos of all flavours .",
    "for some atmospheric neutrino measurements its better resolution with respect to super - kamiokande compensates the reduced statistics due to the lower mass .",
    "a 600 t icarus module has already been approved and is scheduled to start data taking in 2001 . if approved promptly , the first ( out of 4 ) icanoe modules could be operational in 2003 .",
    "a future 30 kt version ( super - icarus ) has also been considered at the letter of intent level @xcite .",
    "if detected with sufficiently high resolution , the observation of neutrino oscillations should yield a sinusoidal oscillation pattern ( eq . ( [ prob ] ) ) .",
    "however , none of the experiments which have yielded indications for neutrino oscillations have so far succeeded to measure such a pattern .",
    "figure [ fig : skle ] shows the @xmath15 distribution obtained by super - kamiokande @xcite compared to the expectation for neutrino oscillations and to a functional form suggested by a recent neutrino decay model @xcite .",
    "once the detector resolution is taken into account , the two hypotheses are essentially indistinguishable @xcite .",
    "even though the current evidence is very suggestive of neutrino oscillations , a more precise measurement of the oscillation pattern is the only way to actually prove the oscillation hypothesis for atmospheric neutrinos . in particular",
    ", it should be proven that muon neutrinos do not only disappear , but actually reappear at some larger l / e .",
    "the proposed monolith experiment @xcite is explicitly designed to achieve this goal . having a similar mass as super - kamiokande , significantly larger acceptance at high neutrino energies and better @xmath15 resolution , the experiment is optimized to observe the full first oscillation swing , including @xmath0 `` reappearance '' . therefore , the oscillation hypothesis can be clearly distinguished from other hypothesis which yield a pure threshold behaviour ( figure [ fig : oscdip ] )",
    ".    monolith 4 years    [ fig : oscdip ]    a similar measurement is also being pursued by the icanoe experiment ( figure [ fig : icanoe ] ) and , on a somewhat longer timescale , by the aqua - rich project @xcite .",
    "[ fig : icanoe ]    [ fig : dm002 ]    furthermore , the sensitivity to detect the oscillation pattern does not strongly depend on the oscillation parameters .",
    "this is in contrast to long baseline experiments like minos , which can do a similar measurement at the highest allowed @xmath9 if the low energy beam is used @xcite , but for which the observation of a reappearance signal in the lower @xmath9 range is not obvious .",
    "[ fig : dm002 ] shows the expected pattern in monolith for @xmath22 ev@xmath10 .",
    "this figure also illustrates the result of normalizing the sample of upgoing ( oscillated ) neutrinos to the sample of downward going ( unoscillated ) ones .",
    "taking the ratio eliminates most of the systematic error due to the atmospheric neutrino flux and the detector response @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ fig : monbeam ] gives an example how the atmospheric neutrino measurement could be complemented by a disappearance measurement in a high energy neutrino beam .",
    "this possibility is particularly attractive for high @xmath9 ( here : @xmath23 ev@xmath10 ) .",
    "[ fig : monbeam ]    finally , the pattern measurement can be used to significantly improve the measurement of the oscillation parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dmsincont ] ) .",
    "again , the result could potentially be improved by combining beam measurements , including the potential @xmath20 appearance rate , with atmospheric measurements ( fig .",
    "[ fig : icabeamatm ] ) .",
    "in such a combination , @xmath24 is mainly constrained by the atmospheric neutrino measurement , which allows a precise @xmath9 determination from the beam information if @xmath9 is not too low .",
    "[ fig : icabeamatm ]",
    "for maximal @xmath1 oscillations in the @xmath9 range @xmath25 ev@xmath10 , the expected @xmath20 appearance rate in atmospheric neutrinos is about 1 per kty @xcite .",
    "such events could be directly observed in icanoe , but the low rate limits the statistical significance to about 2.5 @xmath26 in 4 years @xcite . in monolith",
    "the rate is larger due to the larger mass , but the @xmath20 candidates can only be detected indirectly through an apparent enhancement of the nc up / down ratio at high energies ( hadronic decays of upward going @xmath20 s ) .",
    "again , the significance is limited to about 2 - 3 @xmath26 in 4 years .",
    "the best results on @xmath11 appearance are therefore expected to be obtained from long baseline beams .",
    "however , these atmospheric neutrino measurements could yield useful complementary information in the case of complicated hybrid oscillation models .    to obtain a significant sample of atmospheric @xmath20 neutrinos ,",
    "bigger detectors like super - icarus @xcite or uno @xcite might be needed .",
    "matter effects can play an important role if there are significant contributions of @xmath12 or @xmath14 to atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "already now , super - kamiokande uses the nonobservation of large matter effects to exclude the pure @xmath13 oscillation hypothesis at 99% c.l .",
    "@xcite . for",
    "a contribution of nonmaximal @xmath13 oscillations , matter effects would also manifest themselves in differences in the oscillation patterns for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "such differences could be measured with monolith @xcite , and could yield important constraints on hybrid oscillation scenarios @xcite .",
    "[ fig : xxx ]    [ fig : yyy ]    interestingly , such effects could be detectable even in standard three flavour oscillation scenarios ( figs . [",
    "fig : xxx ] and [ fig : yyy ] ) . a small @xmath27 contribution , close to the chooz limit @xcite , could be strongly enhanced in particular regions of phase space through matter resonances , such that it could be measured in @xmath0 disappearance .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath9 , such enhancements occur either for neutrinos or for antineutrinos only . by comparing the neutrino and antineutrino distributions in a magnetized iron detector , the sign of @xmath9 , and therefore the neutrino mass hierarchy ,",
    "could be determined if a signal would be observed .",
    "even a low statistics measurement could be used for this purpose if the @xmath3 oscillation parameters were already measured by the forthcoming long baseline neutrino experiments for which matter effects are essentially negligible .    finally , the icanoe experiment , which is able to detect atmospheric @xmath12 s down to the lowest possible energies ( but not their charge ) , has a window of opportunity @xcite to detect a subleading @xmath28 contribution from the `` solar '' @xmath9 if the large angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem @xcite would turn out to be true .",
    "such a contribution would also be strongly affected by matter effects .",
    "in conclusion , several experiments are in preparation which could improve the present atmospheric neutrino measurements .",
    "such measurements should prove ( or disprove ) the oscillation hypothesis for atmospheric neutrinos by measuring the oscillation pattern , contribute to disentangle potential complicated hybrid oscillation solutions from the simple @xmath29 oscillation scenario , and potentially determine the neutrino mass hierarchy through the observation of matter effects even in standard three neutrino scenarios .",
