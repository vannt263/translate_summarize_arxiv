    "the determination of integrated and differential cross sections for the production of light mesons in the energy range up to 1  gev above threshold in proton - proton reactions is very important for the understanding of the underlying elementary mechanisms as well as for the interpretation of heavy ion results .",
    "however , most of the high - precision and high - statistics experiments were performed near threshold . at higher energies ,",
    "a large number of older data sets are available but only for integrated cross sections@xcite .    concerning the @xmath1 production at such energies ,",
    "the disto collaboration provided a comprehensive set of measurements , including momentum and angular distributions as well as @xmath4 dalitz plots , all at three different beam energies ( 2.15 , 2.5 and 2.85 gev)@xcite . however , the provided angular distributions were integrated over the whole dalitz plot .",
    "moreover , the disto collaboration studied the angular distribution of @xmath0 mesons in @xmath2 reactions at 2.85  gev beam kinetic energy@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we present new measurements of integrated and differential cross sections for the production of @xmath1 and @xmath0 mesons in @xmath2 reactions at 3.5  gev beam kinetic energy using the magnetic spectrometer hades@xcite ( * * h**igh * * a**cceptance * * d**i-**e**lectron * * s**pectrometer ) .",
    "the reconstruction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons was done via their decay into three pions ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the two protons and charged pions were identified using energy loss information in the drift chambers .",
    "the @xmath6 was reconstructed via the missing mass method . to improve the momentum resolution ,",
    "a kinematical fit was applied .",
    "the background channels were removed by a cut on the probability of the fit .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons can be clearly identified as two peaks on top of a continous background in the two protons missing mass spectrum .",
    "for the @xmath0 meson production , we present in fig . [ fig : omega ] the @xmath7 dalitz plot and polar angular distribution in the c.m . system .",
    "all plots were corrected for the detector acceptance bin - by - bin using a corresponding factor extracted from a pluto@xcite + geant simulation .",
    "we do not observe a strong contribution of resonances in the production and we find that the polar angular distribution of @xmath0 mesons is only slightly anisotropic . the determined cross section amounts to ( 137@xmath827 )  @xmath9b ( prelim . ) .",
