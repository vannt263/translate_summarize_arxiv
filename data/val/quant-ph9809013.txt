    "high order harmonic generation ( hohg ) refers to the radiation emitted during the interaction of a short laser pulse with a gas jet .",
    "the spectrum of such a radiation consists of a series of odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency having approximately equal conversion efficiency ( plateau ) , and followed by an abrupt cut - off . a complete description of harmonic generation which allows for",
    "a direct comparison with the experiments should include not only the response of the single atom to the laser field , but also the propagation of the different harmonics generated through the macroscopic medium .",
    "recently , several studies on harmonic generation have focused on the properties of the phase of the generated harmonic waves considering both , single atom and propagation effects@xcite . within the frame of the single atom response",
    "the strength and the phase of each harmonic wave corresponds to the modulus and the phase acquired by the dipole moment @xmath0 , or equivalently , the dipole acceleration induced by the external laser field .",
    "thus the spectrum of the radiated harmonics can be directly calculated from the fourier transform of the dipole acceleration@xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the amplitude , @xmath3 is the phase of the dipole acceleration in the frequency domain , and @xmath4 the strength of the harmonics .",
    "the single atom response shows that the phase of each harmonic , @xmath3 , is usually shifted with respect to the fundamental phase and depends strongly on the intensity of the laser field@xcite .",
    "let us recall that the harmonics are said phase - locked if the phase of each individual harmonic is a linear function of its order _ q _ so it can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the linear @xmath7-dependent term and @xmath8 a constant term identical for all harmonics . in general , harmonics from the plateau region present a random phase when compared to each other , and only the harmonics from the cut - off region are locked in phase .",
    "this can be intuitively understood using the semi - classical description of the atom - field interaction in which harmonic generation results from the recombination of those electrons which have previously tunneled out through the effective potential produced by the coulomb and the laser field .",
    "the induced dipole , and hence the process of harmonic generation corresponds to trajectories in which the electron returns to the core with appropriate kinetic energy and recombines emitting a photon .",
    "each contribution contains then a phase factor equal to the real part of the action acquired by the electron following the respective trajectory@xcite . among all possible trajectories ,",
    "very few of them are relevant . for the harmonics in the cutoff",
    "there is only one dominant trajectory , corresponding to a single recombination time and , therefore , the phase of the harmonics in this region remains locked . on the other hand , for the harmonics lying in the plateau , there are typically two relevant trajectories corresponding to two different returning times .",
    "the phase of such an harmonic contains the contributions of these two trajectories and in particular their quantum interferences .",
    "this quantum interefence term leads to an apparently random phase . in spite of this fact , when one analyzes the harmonic emission in time rather than in frequency domain , one observes a clear periodicity of the signal .",
    "antoine et al . @xcite",
    "have shown that the time dependent emission consist of a train of ultrashort pulses with two dominant pulses per half cycle , each corresponding to one of the relevant trajectories .",
    "further studies show that under certain geometrical conditions it should be possible to phase - match the contribution of only one of these trajectories .",
    "that results in a train of ultrashort pulses equivalent to those obtained by combining several plateau harmonics with their phases locked .    from an experimental point of view , determining the relative phase of the emitted harmonics is not a straightforward task .",
    "its study necessarily involves some type of interference effects between the different harmonics .",
    "although some pioneering work on interference between harmonics of the same order have been recently reported@xcite , a conclusive result on the relative phase has not yet been achieved .    in this paper",
    "we address this question using a combination of successive odd harmonics to study two - photon processes .",
    "when several harmonics irradiate simultaneously an atom , there exist various paths associated with 2-photon transitions ending up into the same final state thus leading to possible interference effects .",
    "those effects should be clearly present in the ionization rates , as well as in the photoelectron spectra .",
    "similar effects of sensitivity to harmonics phases have been previously studied in a series of papers on ati by mixing harmonics and infrared laser fields@xcite .",
    "furthermore , two - photon ionization of atoms with photons pertaining to the vuv - xuv domain have been recently reported for argon using the third harmonic of krf laser @xcite , and for helium using the 9@xmath9 harmonic of a ti : sapphire laser@xcite giving thus evidence of its experimental feasibility . in this paper",
    ", we focus on two - photon ionization of atoms by ti : sapphire harmonics whose order varies from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .    essentially , the aim of the paper is to show that measurable quantities such as ionization or the more detailed photoelectron spectrum have a different behavior depending on the relative phases of the harmonics and to study these effects quantitatively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : combi ] we develop a combinatorial model derived from perturbation theory which is able to provide rough scaling laws for the total ionization rates as a function of the number of harmonics present in the field . section [ sec : ati ] reports on numerical above threshold ionization rates obtained by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) with realistic polychromatic pulses for atomic h. section [ sec : mpi ] is a study of quasi - resonant multiphoton ionization ( mpi ) in he@xmath12 also obtained by solving tdse .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we give concluding remarks and we comment on possible experiments .",
    "the model presented in this section provides an estimate for the ionization probability as a function of the number of successive odd harmonics included in the laser field .",
    "it is based on a combinatorial approach and a perturbative treatment of the atom - field interaction .",
    "let us first sketch the problem under investigation .",
    "we consider electrons emitted during ionization via a 2-photon process from an atom initially in its ground state ( the possible case where some excited intermediate state come into resonance with the absorption of only one photon is discussed in section [ sec : mpi ] ) .",
    "since the field considered here consists of a linear combination of successive odd harmonics : @xmath13 photons of different energies will be involved in the production of electrons with different kinetic energies , as it is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_fig ] .",
    "note that the energies at which electrons are released appear on the photo - electron spectrum separated exactly by the energy of 2 photons of the fundamental field @xmath14 which generates the harmonics .",
    "moreover , electrons at a particular energy may have been released by the absorption of photons originated from distinct harmonics . the only restriction being that whatever the combination of photons is , the sum of their energies ought to be the same .",
    "for example , the production of electrons in the central peak of the electron spectrum of fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_fig ] results from transitions following three different quantum paths .",
    "the amplitudes associated to each quantum path may interfere depending on the relative phase of the photons involved .",
    "the interference pattern appears clearly if one writes the ionization probability associated with these processes ( labeled 3 on fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_fig ] ) within perturbation theory : @xmath15 where the subscripts @xmath16,@xmath17 and @xmath18 refer to the biggest , the smallest and the intermediate photon , @xmath19 refers to the maximum field amplitude , and @xmath20 refers to the phase of the photons .",
    "the transition amplitude matrix elements from the initial state @xmath21 to the final state @xmath22 for the three paths are given by : @xmath23 where the summation runs over all coupled intermediate states including the continuum .",
    "the special case of ati can be numerically extrapolated@xcite or computed accounting explicitely for the resonant free - free transition matrix elements@xcite .",
    "since we assume the interaction with a linearly polarized field and express it in the length gauge , only the matrix elements of @xmath24 appear in expression ( [ eq : transition_amplitudes ] ) .",
    "the ionization probability then reads : @xmath25 interferences in the probability given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : proba_interferences ] ) are governed by the phase difference @xmath26 that is , the relative phase between the harmonics involved in this process . such a partial probability can be derived for all accessible final states .",
    "note , that interferences are always absent in processes involving less than 3 different photons which is always the case for the processes leading to the two first and two last final states ( like processes labeled 1,2,4 and 5 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_fig ] ) independently of the total number of harmonics included in the field .    when the incident field is a linear combination of successive harmonics , there",
    "exist several distinct quantum paths associated to transitions to the same final state .",
    "these paths may interfere depending on the relative phase between the photons .",
    "obviously , the number of possible interfering paths increases with the number of different frequencies included in the field .    to simplify the problem",
    ", we will now assume that all harmonics have the same strength , that is @xmath27 .",
    "as the harmonics we are considering here all come from the plateau part of the spectrum , this assumption is generally fulfilled .",
    "furthermore , we also assume that all 2-photon transition amplitude matrix elements ( as they are defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transition_amplitudes ] ) ) are real and have the same value , i.e. @xmath28 . although never fulfilled in general , this approximation is reasonable if the first photon absorbed brings the system into a region free of intermediate resonances .",
    "for the case of our illustrative example , the ionization probability associated to the central process ( labeled 3 in fig . [",
    "fig : ati_fig ] ) , corresponds to : @xmath29 let us now analyze the two configurations of harmonic phases we are interested in , that is , the phase locked case and the random distribution of phases . as defined in the introduction ,",
    "if harmonics are phase locked to each other , their phase has the form : @xmath5 . applied to our example @xmath30 simply reduces to zero .",
    "therefore , the cosine function in eq.([eq : proba_interf_simplified ] ) takes value one . on another hand",
    ", we can interpret the random distribution of phases as a loss of coherence between different quantum paths .",
    "it is then reasonable to associate the random distribution to the average value of eq.([eq : proba_interf_simplified ] ) over all possible phases .",
    "since the average value of the cosine function is zero , all terms in the probability vanish except the constant ( phase - independent ) terms .",
    "generalizing these results for an arbitrary number @xmath31 of incident harmonics , we obtain that the ionization probability associated to the central peak behaves as :    @xmath32    and @xmath33 where pl refers to phase locked configuration , rp to random phase configuration and @xmath34 .",
    "the total 2-photon ionization probability is straightforwardly obtained by integrating the electron spectrum over the electron energy range relative to the 2-photon processes .",
    "this probability accounts for the side peaks in the photoelectron spectrum and is obtained by simply adding the probability associated to each side peak ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_fig ] ) .",
    "it can be shown that the total probabilities read : @xmath35 and @xmath36 as mentioned earlier , when ordered by increasing final state energy , the two first and two last processes will never show path interferences independently of the total number of harmonics involved .",
    "also , the process having the largest number of interference terms will always be the central one ( like process number 3 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_fig ] ) .    to summarize ,",
    "the total ionization associated with 2-photon absorption should vary approximately as @xmath37 if the harmonics are locked in phase , and like @xmath38 if the relative phases between them is random .",
    "accordingly , the ionization rate associated to the central process should vary like @xmath39 in the phase locked case and like @xmath40 if the phase distribution is random .",
    "we expect that similar scaling properties will characterize other processes of interest , such as 2-photon above threshold ionization ( ati ) which we shall discuss in the next section .",
    "the advantage of studying ati instead of 2-photon ionization processes is that such processes are free from intermediate resonances that modify the interference pattern , as we shall discuss in section [ sec : mpi ] .",
    "the disadvantage on the other hand , is that the ati signal might be low and , consequently the effects due to the relative phase of the harmonics might be difficult to observe experimentally .",
    "finally , it is worth stressing here that the problem considered in this section has a lot in common with the problems of ionization by stochastic laser fields , discussed in the literature in the 70 s and 80s@xcite . in particular ,",
    "the enhancement by a factor @xmath41 of the @xmath42-photon ionization probability by multimode laser fields has been predicted and observed . in our random phase model ,",
    "the same effect is responsible for the fact that @xmath43 . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem considered in this paper is more general and deals with the differences induced by random and phase locked configurations in laser pulses in _ real _ atoms , i.e. it fully accounts for atomic bound states and continuum structures .",
    "in this section , ati is investigated using a time - dependent non - perturbative approach .",
    "it consists in solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) for a hydrogen atom interacting with the combination of several harmonic fields .",
    "the method used to solve the tdse and to compute the electron spectrum is based on the expansion of the total wave - function on spherical harmonics and b - spline functions ( see @xcite ) . the temporal propagation in the length gauge",
    "is well adapted to the rather low intensities considered here .",
    "the electron spectra correspond to electrons emitted in the direction of the polarization .",
    "we have computed the electron spectra obtained by shining a linear combination of successive harmonics on atomic hydrogen in its ground state .",
    "the frequencies of the selected harmonics are chosen so that absorption of a single photon already brings the system into the continuum .",
    "thus , the 2-photon processes we are interested in belong to the so - called above threshold ionization regime . in our approach , the field is described semi - classically as : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the normalized envelope of the field , in our case a cosine squared with @xmath46 full width at half maximum ( 20 cycles of harmonic 11 ) ; @xmath47 is the maximum field amplitude ( identical for all harmonics ) corresponding to an intensity of @xmath48 ; @xmath49 ev is the fundamental photon energy and @xmath50 indicates the lowest harmonic component in the polychromatic field .",
    "the number of harmonics we consider varies from @xmath51 to @xmath52 , so that the odd harmonics included are h13 h15 for @xmath51 , h13h17 for @xmath53 , h11h17 for @xmath54 and h11h19 for @xmath52 .",
    "the field corresponding to the case @xmath52 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : n=5_field ] . the electron spectrum due to such a field",
    "is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_n=5 ] where we observe that electrons produced via different order processes are clearly distinguishable .",
    "the spectrum has to be read as follows : there are 3 clear subsets of ati peaks , each of them corresponding to a different order process .",
    "the left most subset corresponds to order 1 , that is , direct photo - ionization via the absorption of a single photon ( h11 for the very first peak and h19 for the fifth ) .",
    "the second subset , which is the one investigated here embodies all processes of order 2 .",
    "for example , the third peak of that subset results from the simultaneous absorption of either two photons from the harmonic 13 , or one from the harmonic 11 and another from the harmonic 15 .",
    "all possible allowed polychromatic combinations are included in this type of simulation .",
    "higher order processes appear with exponentially decreasing probability and , therefore , their study have a restricted interest from an experimental point of view .",
    "we have limited ourselves to a maximum of 5 combined harmonics in this study because higher values would lead to overlapping subsets of ati peaks as it is almost the case for @xmath52 where the 3-photon processes subset partly overlap the 2-photon subset ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_n=5 ] ) .",
    "let us now focus on the 2-photon above - threshold ionization , that is , the central subset of ati peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig : ati_n=5 ] .",
    "the problem of interest here is to determine how much does the total ionization associated with 2-photon absorption increase as we increase the number of harmonics in the field assuming that either all harmonics are locked in phase , or their relative phases are random .",
    "we have first simulated the case of phase - locked harmonics .",
    "this is achieved by solving the tdse when all harmonic phases @xmath55 are set to zero .",
    "[ fig : power_law_pl ] shows the 2-photon ionization probability as a function of the number of harmonics included in the field .",
    "the main result to be read from fig .",
    "[ fig : power_law_pl ] is that ionization certainly scales like the cubic power of the number of harmonics as predicted by the combinatorial approach eq.([eq : pl ] ) .",
    "similarly , the ionization probability associated with the central ati peak scales like @xmath56 , in good agreement with eq.([eq : pl_central ] ) .    to simulate the case where the phases are random",
    ", we have accumulated the results of 500 different random phase configurations after solving the schrdinger equation for each of them and we have averaged the results at the end . this has been done for each value of @xmath31 .",
    "we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_law_rp_tot ] the ionization probability thus obtained together with its statistics fluctuations .",
    "the most interesting result here is the behavior of the average value of the ionization ( open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_law_rp_tot ] ) .",
    "the average value scales like @xmath57 , departing significantly from the combinatorial estimate that predicts a @xmath58 law ( eq . [ eq : rp ] ) .",
    "let us now examine the statistical fluctuations . on one hand , we find that the maximum value of the ionization ( down triangles in fig . [",
    "fig : power_law_rp_tot ] ) scales as @xmath59 , very close to that of the phase locked case .",
    "obviously , the configurations that lead to such maximal value are the special cases where all phase differences are close to zero like in our simulation of the phase locked configuration .",
    "on the other hand , the most globally destructive phase configuration leading to the minimum value of the ionization probability scales like @xmath60 ( up triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_law_rp_tot ] ) .",
    "we have also investigated the ionization probabilities associated to the central 2-photon ati peak , since it is the transition that involves the largest number of interfering quantum paths .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : power_law_rp_central ] .",
    "the average value of the ionization probability scales as ( @xmath61 ) in comparison with the fit ( @xmath56 ) obtained for the phase locked case .",
    "finally , its minimum value drops dramatically since interferences now can be completely destructive , that is , there exists a particular configuration of phases able to totally suppress ionization for this particular electron energy .",
    "this feature is absent in the case of total 2-photon ionization since , as explained before , the 4 outermost ati peaks correspond to transitions involving only two quantum paths , and therefore are not affected by any change in phase .",
    "a way to improve the statistical results is to increase the number of harmonics included in the field by using higher order harmonics .",
    "this will prevent us from having different ati order processes overlapping but also the ionization signal will decrease because the cross - section associated to these processes decays with increasing photon energy .",
    "a solution to ease 2-photon ionization due to higher harmonics is to start from a less bound atomic energy level like h(2s ) for example .    by choosing harmonic 21 ( @xmath62 ev ) as the central component",
    ", we can combine up to 7 harmonics . because the lower binding energy , we set now the field intensity of all harmonic components to @xmath63 w/@xmath64 .",
    "as expected with this intensity , the probability for ionization by a 2-photon process is very low .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that this probability varies like @xmath65 in agreement with the process order , and that the intensity we are using here underestimates experimental attainable fluxes .",
    "we find that in the phase locked case , the scaling laws concerning total ionization associated with 2-photon absorption shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2s_power_law_pl ] agree very well with the combinatorial estimates expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pl_central ] ) and ( [ eq : pl ] ) .    the random phase simulation for h(2s ) has been carried out by accumulating results from 300 resolutions of the tdse , each time with a new random distribution of harmonic phases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2s_power_law_rp_tot ] , we show the 2-photon ati probability , obtained by integrating the spectrum over the whole range of electron energies corresponding to 2-photon ati processes . in the case",
    "@xmath66 , the integration runs from @xmath67 ev up to @xmath68 ev . here",
    "again , there is a significant departure of the average value of the ionization probability , which scales as @xmath69 , from the @xmath58 combinatorial law associated with the random phase configuration .",
    "finally , as in the previous section , we have looked at the most phase sensitive ati peak located at the center of the 2-photon ati subset in the electron spectrum .",
    "the expected combinatorial power laws are 2 and 1 for harmonic phases , locked and random respectively .",
    "the quantum mechanical computation gives the values of 2 and 1.3 for the respective configurations as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : h2s_power_law_rp_central ] . the lower limit of the distribution drops abruptly until it reaches the background induced by the numerical accuracy ( around @xmath70 on fig . [ fig : h2s_power_law_rp_central ] ) .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that there is a different behavior in the 2-photon ionization probabilities as a function of @xmath31 if one considers the harmonics locked in phase or if the distribution of their phases is random . to a rough extend , scaling laws",
    "can be explained using the idealized combinatorial model of section ii .",
    "the previous section has been devoted to the study of 2-photon ati processes , where absorption from a single photon already brings the system into the continuum .",
    "now , we propose to study direct 2-photon harmonic ionization ( mpi ) .",
    "in contrast with the 2-photon ati cases , ionization requires now two harmonic photons , so the interference effects governed by the harmonic phases appear directly in the first subset of peaks in the electron spectra .    at this point ,",
    "let us recall that our combinatorial model is based on the assumption that the total transition amplitude towards a given final state is only related to the number of interfering paths leading to such final state .",
    "this assumption , in turn , implies that all the matrix elements involved in the transitions are considered equal .",
    "the results obtained so far indicate that this is a reasonable assumption for 2-photon ati processes where bound - bound transitions do not play any essential role .",
    "however , 2-photon ionization processes ( mpi ) may involve quasi - resonant bound - bound transitions . at low intensities ,",
    "i.e. in the frame of perturbation theory , the values of the bound - bound transition matrix elements depend strongly on how close the transition is from a resonance .",
    "as we shall see , this fact substantially modifies the results we have encountered so far .    in order to optimize the study of the interferences between different harmonics having , at the same time , a good control of the role of the resonances involved , we choose as a model a hydrogenic ion ( he@xmath71 ) .",
    "note , however , that the results we present in this section can be straightforwardly generalized to any atom or ion and , therefore , have a certain generic validity .",
    "we numerically solve the tdse for direct 2-photon ionization , where the external field is a linear combination of different harmonic fields , all of them with the same polarization and intensity .",
    "as in the previous sections , we consider harmonics from a ti : sapphire laser ( @xmath72 ev ) , set the intensity of each harmonic to @xmath73 w/@xmath64 and calculate ionization probabilities as well as photoelectron spectra for phase locked and random phase configurations . for our choice of parameters , the smallest harmonic from ti : sapphire required for 2-photon detachment of he@xmath71 is the 19th and the largest one the 35th .",
    "larger harmonics will directly detach the ion , and smaller ones than 19th can not achieve 2-photon detachment .    before proceeding further , it is illustrative to show some of the effects due to atomic resonances in the photoelectron spectrum . to this aim",
    "we display the spectrum for a phase locked configuration containing : ( a ) n=4 harmonics ranging from 19th to 25th ( fig.[fig : d2p1 ] ) and ; ( b ) n=6 harmonics ranging from 19th to 29th ( fig.[fig : d2p2 ] ) . in both spectra",
    "there are two distinguishable set of peaks : the first one corresponds to 2-photon detachment processes , the second one corresponds to 3-photon processes ( ati peaks ) . from an experimental point of view",
    ", the interest in the second subset should be restricted due to the low probability of 3-photon processes .",
    "the first subset contains @xmath74 different peaks , where @xmath31 is the number of harmonics present in the external field .",
    "as mentioned in the previous sections , the central peak of this subset corresponds , in both cases , to the transition involving the largest number of different quantum paths . while in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2p1 ] this peak is the most probable one , in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2p2 ] the central peak is clearly suppressed in comparison with lower order peaks .",
    "the reason for this peak suppression is due to the fact that the 27th harmonics ( only present in case ( b ) ) crosses the @xmath75 resonance quasi - resonantly .",
    "let us now focus on the results corresponding to ionization probabilities .",
    "as in section [ sec : ati ] , the 2-photon detachment probability is calculated by integrating the area below all 2-photon processes in the photoelectron spectrum .",
    "we start by analyzing the random phase configuration where we have accumulated results from a large number of random phase distributions and we have averaged them at the end . in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2p3 ] we plot the average value of the ionization probability versus the number of incident harmonics @xmath31 which varies from @xmath51 to @xmath66 .",
    "the lowest harmonic involved is always the 19@xmath9 so @xmath51 includes harmonics 19 - 21 , @xmath53 includes harmonics 19 - 21 - 23 , and so on .",
    "the overall behavior of the ionization probability obtained numerically ( dots ) agrees relatively well with the combinatorial approach ( full line ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2p4 ] we present the corresponding ionization probability as a function of the number of harmonics @xmath31 , for the phase locked configuration . in the simulation , all the individual harmonic phases , @xmath76 , have been set to zero .",
    "again , the full line represents the results from the combinatorial approach ( eq . [ eq : pl ] ) , while symbols show our numerical results .",
    "we observe that for low order incident harmonics i.e. from 19th to 25th , the numerical results agree relatively well with the combinatorial approach .",
    "however , when higher harmonics are included ( from 27@xmath9 onwards ) the combinatorial approach clearly overestimates the ionization probability obtained numerically .",
    "the discrepancy between the estimate and the numerical value becomes then dramatic .",
    "this discrepancy can be understood by analyzing the role of resonances within perturbation theory . under the parameters we have used in the simulations , the energy of the 27@xmath9 harmonic is slightly detuned ( from above ) from the @xmath75 resonance . as a result ,",
    "the matrix elements corresponding to transitions of the type : @xmath77 where @xmath78 refers to the second photon absorbed , flip their sign compared to those transitions which are far off resonance .",
    "let us analyze in more detail the 2-photon mpi transitions .",
    "from the 2 possible paths starting from the ground state leading to photodetachment ; @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the second one clearly dominates over the first one .",
    "this is because transitions that increase their principal quantum number and their angular momentum in the same direction are always favored compared to the others @xcite .",
    "therefore , we focus on 2-photon transitions of the type @xmath80 and present the values of @xmath81 in table [ tab : elements ]    the table has to be interpreted as follows : rows refer to the first absorbed photon and columns to the second one .",
    "for example , the first row displays the values of the matrix elements corresponding to transitions in which the first absorbed photon is the 19@xmath9 harmonic and the second one the one indicated by the column label , i.e. transition amplitude of the type : @xmath82 .",
    "as it should be , we observe that the values of the matrix elements ( i ) decrease as the energy of the final state increases and ( ii ) decrease for transitions far from resonances . immediately after a resonance has been crossed , the matrix element flip its sign .",
    "thus , with the parameters we have use in the simulation , all matrix elements corresponding to the absorption from the ground state of a photon from the 27@xmath9harmonic ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : sign ] ) ) flip their sign compared to all the other matrix elements shown in the table .",
    "this relative sign flip strongly affects the total ionization probability in the phase locked case , for which @xmath83 , i.e. proportional to the square of the sum of the individual matrix elements .",
    "it has also consequences for random phase configurations but there the effects are less dramatic .",
    "it is easier to understand the difference between both cases with an example .",
    "consider an incident field containing harmonics 25@xmath9 , 27@xmath9and 29@xmath9 .",
    "such an incident field , leads to five possible final electron energy states , which ordered by increasing energy correspond to : ( i ) 25 + 25 ( absorption of 2 photons from harmonic 25@xmath84 ) ; ( ii ) @xmath85 , @xmath86 ; ( iii ) @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ; ( iv ) @xmath90 , @xmath91 and finally ( v ) @xmath92 .",
    "remember that in order to have interference effects we need at least 3 different quantum paths contributing to the process . therefore , the partial ionization probabilities associated to states ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iv ) and ( v ) are the same regardless the relative phase of the harmonics . the partial ionization probability associated to state ( iii ) which contains contributions from 3 different quantum paths depends on the relative phases of the harmonics .",
    "for phase locked harmonics , it is proportional to @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the harmonics have a random phase , the partial ionization probability associated to the final state ( iii ) is proportional to @xmath94 . comparing both expressions",
    ", we note that it is only in the phase locked case where the sign of @xmath95 plays a definite role since it acts effectively as a destructive interference term .",
    "notice that the values of the matrix elements corresponding to transitions @xmath86 and @xmath96 do modify the partial ionization probabilities associated to the final states ( ii ) and ( iv ) respectively , but they do it exactly in the same way for both cases : locked and random phase configurations .    to corroborate our findings we have extended our numerical results up to the @xmath97 harmonic ( @xmath98 ) . for the parameters we have used ,",
    "the photon energy of harmonic 33@xmath99 is slightly higher than the atomic transition @xmath100 .",
    "consequently , the matrix elements corresponding to absorption from the ground state of a photon from harmonic 33@xmath99 will again flip their sign , and again act as an effective destructive interference for locked phase configurations . as a result ,",
    "the disagreement between the ionization probability and the combinatorial estimate should increase .",
    "our numerical results support this conclusion .    in spite of the discrepancy between our numerical results and the combinatorial estimates ,",
    "it should be stressed here that nevertheless the overall behavior of the ionization probability for random and phase locked configurations remains distinct , allowing in principle for a distinction between both cases .",
    "we would like to remark here that accordingly to what we have seen , it might also occur that for a _",
    "particular _ final state energy , its associated partial transition probability becomes larger for incident harmonics with random phases than for phase locked harmonics .",
    "such a partial peak inversion demonstrates that the effects due to atomic resonances can be in some cases strong enough to compensate the effects due to quantum phase interference .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that that the overall behavior of the ionization probability clearly depends on the relative phase configuration of the incident harmonics .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that for phase locked configurations and incident harmonic fields near - resonance , the total ionization probability strongly departs from the combinatorial estimate and it does no longer follow the @xmath101 power law ( eq . [ eq : pl ] ) . if , on the contrary , the incident harmonics are all far of atomic resonances , the combinatorial estimate predicts accurately the exact results ( eq . [ eq : pl ] and [ eq : rp ] ) .",
    "we stress , however , that most two - photon ionization experiments involving a set of harmonics is bound to show the effects of resonances .",
    "finally , for incident harmonics with random phases , the average value of the ionization probability agrees relatively well with the combinatorial approach i.e.@xmath58 .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that in 2-photon ati of hydrogen atoms by multiple orders high harmonics , measurable quantities such as the ionization yield or the photoelectron spectra significantly depend on the relative phase of the harmonics .",
    "it should therefore be possible to determine experimentally the phase configuration of the high harmonics and , in particular if the phases are locked .",
    "the method suggested by the calculation is a measurement of these quantities as a function of the number of selected harmonics .",
    "clearly this is a difficult task .",
    "one difficulty lies in the relatively low photon harmonic flux currently achievable : @xmath102 photons using @xmath103 lasers in argon , and @xmath104 photons using @xmath105 in neon @xcite .",
    "such a flux is in general too low to observe two - photon processes .",
    "however , several possibilities to increase the harmonic fluxes are under investigation , based on shortening the duration of the pump pulses @xcite or improving the phase - matching@xcite .",
    "furthermore , initial states prepared as coherent superpositions of two or more bound states can potentially increase the harmonic generation efficiency in the part of the spectrum we are interested in @xcite .",
    "another challenge to be faced in a real experiment will be the making of multilayer mirrors with different bandwidths to vary the number of selected harmonics without changing their relative phases . in spite of these obstacles",
    ", we think that such an experiment is not out of reach and could be useful in asserting the existence of subfemtosecond harmonic pulses in the cases of locked phases .",
