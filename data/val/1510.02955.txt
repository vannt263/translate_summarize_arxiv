    "the seminal work of henri poincar brought up to attention a very important fact : the motion of an incompressible fluid of finite volume is recurrent @xcite . for hamiltonian systems",
    "this means that almost all orbits come arbitrarily close to an initial point an infinite number of times . for many years",
    "the properties of such recurrences have been analyzed in distinct physical situations by using the rts .",
    "it was observed that the rts is capable of describing the relevant aspects of the dynamics in complex systems . in this context , we mention that the rts is able to describe universal algebraic decays in hamiltonian systems @xcite , including random walk penetration of the kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) islands  @xcite , biased random walk to escape from kam island @xcite , dna sequence @xcite , synchronization of oscillator @xcite , generalized bifurcation diagram of conservative systems @xcite , fine structure of resonance islands @xcite , transient chaos in systems with leaks @xcite , among others .    in distinction to the above works related to area - preserving maps , a novel situation occurs for non - hamiltonian three - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) vps , whose dynamics has applications in volume - preserving flows , and chaotic scattering , where particles are captured and scattered on resonance ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "one work in this direction related the rts with anomalous transport in a fluid flow @xcite .    in case of scattering problems , there exist a scattering region where interactions between particles and the system of interest occur . outside this region",
    "the action of the system is insignificant so that the particles motion is not of relevance .",
    "essential properties from the system of interest is revealed from the behavior of the scattered particles .",
    "in fact , scattering is one of the fundamental tools to unveil the main characteristics of processes in nature , such as in chemical reactions , atomic and nuclear physics , fluid and celestial mechanics @xcite .",
    "recent attentions focused on scattering in conservative systems , where regular and chaotic dynamics coexist and particles can be trapped for finite times close to regular islands leading to an algebraic temporal decay of the scattered particles , which perform a transient chaotic motion . in realistic experiments , the scattered particles",
    "may also be subjected to noise , dissipation , external forces , etc . in most cases noise",
    "destroys the kam curves and the algebraic decay is replaced by the exponential @xcite , or stretched exponential @xcite .",
    "however , recent developments have shown that noise can enhance the algebraic decay due to trajectories performing a random walk motion inside the kam islands  @xcite .",
    "biased random walk was also observed in the standard map under random symplectic perturbations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , flows in three - dimensions arise in a number of different applied contexts such as fluid dynamics and transport of matter in a fluid @xcite .",
    "nonlinear maps can be obtained from fluid flow models and are of two types : action - action - angle and action - angle - angle maps . whereas a action - angle - angle volume - preserving map is analogous to symplectic maps when it comes to kam theorem , the behavior of action - action - angle maps is very different .",
    "it was shown @xcite that no invariant @xmath1d surfaces persist upon perturbation from an integrable action - action - angle map and at these same locations in the phase - space periodic orbits of specific type persist and they dominate the transport in the perturbed map . besides",
    ", many initial conditions can create trajectories that go through a large portion of the phase - space even when the map is very close to being integrable .",
    "this has been named _ resonance - induced dispersion _ ( rid ) @xcite .    in this work we analyzed the rts for two systems : first an action - action - angle map , called the extended standard map ( _ esm _ ) , introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , a non - hamiltonian @xmath0d vps which can be associated with the chaotic scattering problem mentioned above .",
    "our discussion will be mainly focused in the ( _ esm _ ) system .",
    "secondly we consider a fluid flow model @xcite to show the astonishing similarities to the rts in the _",
    "esm_. for the case of the 3d non - hamiltonian map considered ( the esm ) , we    use an additional deterministic dimension , weakly coupled to the standard map ( vortices in the fluid case ) , which allows particles to penetrate the regular islands from the uncoupled case , and eventually approach the center of the island .",
    "mainly we show that the extra - dimension strongly enhances the trapping time around the regular island from the standard map ( vortices ) , resulting in plateaus ( not allowing recurrences ) and algebraic decays in the characteristics recurrence curves and generating asymptotic exponential decays as typically observed , for instance , in area - preserving maps . while short time exponential and long time algebraic decays are similar to those found in hamiltonian system , the large plateaus are apparently a particular property of @xmath0d vps .",
    "we mention here that the plateaus were also found in a totally distinct context , a fertility model which has some applications to earthquakes @xcite .",
    "in addition , asymptotic exponential decays appear to be common in @xmath0d vps . in our analysis",
    "we combine the rts and a recent developed technique @xcite , which uses finite - time lyapunov exponents ( ftles ) , to efficiently determine the time evolution of ordered ( @xmath2 ) , and chaotic ( @xmath3 ) regimes .",
    "this allows us to clearly associate the decays of cumulative distribution of consecutive time spent in the regime @xmath2 ( algebraic or exponential ) , with the penetration inside the regular islands from the uncoupled case .",
    "scalings properties of the rts show that the physical origin of the asymptotic decays is the same for different small couplings intensities with the extra - dimension .",
    "finally , with this work we also intend to give some insight about possible answer for the following questions :  do recurrence - time distributions in typical volume - preserving maps with regular and chaotic components have an asymptotic power - law form like hamiltonian systems with mixed dynamics ?",
    "is there an universal decay exponent of recurrences ?",
    "similar questions were proposed recently @xcite , where the author summarizes both , the state of the art in the theory of transport for conservative dynamical systems , based on the last thirty years of investigations , and tries to point out some open problems that could be addressed next .",

    "here we used @xmath18 randomly equally distributed ics and @xmath19 iterations for each ic . ]    a stability analysis , not presented here , shows that the stable period-@xmath20 and @xmath21 resonances shown in fig .",
    "[ phase - space - mp ] become unstable for @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the center of the regular structure becomes unstable and has crucial consequences for our results .",
    "there might exist other regular structures with stable centers for this model , but we have not found them .",
    "in fact , other kind of couplings and/or extra - dimension dynamics could be used to keep the stability of the center of the structure , but this will certainly change the results presented in sec.[sec : results ] .",
    "two methods , or techniques , will be used to carefully describe the influence of the extra - dimension on the scattered trajectories , as briefly discussed in the sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] .",
    "the first technique is the rts determined numerically by computing the quantity of iterations @xmath22 that the trajectory , starting from an initial pre - delimited chaotic region , collides with the regular structure and comes back to the initial region , called recurrence region .",
    "we are interested in the cumulative probability distribution @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 that gives essential informations about the presence , or not , of sticky motion in conservative systems .",
    "straight lines in the log - log plot of this distribution are power - law decays of the form @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the decay exponent .",
    "such decays are usually related to sticky effects induced by the invariant structures on the chaotic trajectory @xcite .",
    "to reckon @xmath23 we always start with ics randomly distributed inside the recurrence region defined by @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 . each time",
    "the recurrence region is mentioned , it means that the trajectory is already ejected from the region close to the regular structure .",
    "we also tested other boxes for the recurrence region , with different sizes , but our main results remain unchanged .",
    "the second technique consists in using the ftles spectrum @xmath30 to classify ordered and chaotic regimes in time as proposed recently @xcite . for the _ esm _ model",
    "we have three ftles @xmath31 which satisfy @xmath32 and @xmath33 . in order to implement this technique ,",
    "we follow a trajectory and compute the ftles spectrum during a window of size @xmath34 , and explore the temporal properties in the time series of @xmath35 . starting with a typical initial condition chosen in a chaotic region where the largest ftle is greater than zero ,",
    "we follow the trajectory and for times @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) we evaluate @xmath35 . if this trajectory is close to the regular structure we have @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to classify distinct regimes as _ ordered _",
    "@xmath2 , for @xmath39 , and _ chaotic _",
    "@xmath3 , for @xmath40 , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ lyaptme ] along a time series of @xmath41 . in the regime",
    "@xmath2 the trajectory is close to the regular structure and for regime @xmath3 it is in the chaotic region of the phase space . from this analysis",
    "we can obtain the cumulative probability distribution defined as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the time spent consecutively in one of the two possible regimes and @xmath44 indicates the corresponding regime .",
    "it is worth to mention that the ordered regime is composed by a chaotic trajectory which moves , for a finite - time , close to a regular island ( sticky motion ) .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that this classification of regimes significantly improves the ability of the stickiness characterization and , by associating them with the distinct decays in the rts , a clear picture of the underlying dynamics .     and @xmath45 .",
    "the time series of the ftle @xmath46 for the _ esm _ is plotted .",
    "the threshold @xmath47 that defines the regimes is plotted by a dashed - dotted line . a typical initial condition used to generate",
    "this time series was chosen inside the chaotic sea . ]",
    "in this section the numerical results are analyzed . for all simulations we use a mixed dynamics ( @xmath15 ) for the standard map , and change the dynamics of the extra - dimension using the following values @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( see fig .  [ phase - space - mp ] ) .",
    "figure [ rec ] ( a)-(d ) displays the log - log plot of the rts as a function of @xmath22 for different values of @xmath6 . for comparison",
    "we show the uncoupled standard map case @xmath8 ( black - dashed line ) , which displays an exponential decay for small times followed by the power law decay ( @xmath50 ) due to sticky effects . for all couplings we still have the power - law decay ( @xmath50 ) for shorter times .",
    "after these times , a plateau is seen whose width depends on the coupling strength .",
    "the plateau in the rts means that no recurrences were observed for these times .",
    "as will be shown later , during the plateaus the trajectory moves around the regular islands from the uncoupled case and do not return to the recurrence region . for increasing values of the coupling",
    ", we observe that the plateaus appear for earlier times and become shorter .",
    "this occurs independently of the dynamics in the extra - dimension , but tend to disappear for @xmath51 ( not shown here ) in the regular case in fig .",

    "in fact , the case @xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ rec](c ) also shows the asymptotic exponential decay after the abrupt break of the plateau and a smooth power law related with the random walk performed by the trajectory inside the regular structures .",
    "in general we observe the following decays :    * @xmath45 : exponential decay for very short times ( not discussed in this work ) . * @xmath53 : power - law with @xmath54 for @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the time when the plateau appears for given @xmath7 .",

    "@xmath57 : plateaus obeying @xmath58 for times @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the time where the plateaus disappear .",
    "after the plateaus we see distinct behaviors which depend on the dynamics of the extra - dimension :    * @xmath61 : an exponential decay with @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",

    "this model captures the essential features of an alternating vortex flow with ekman pumping .",
    "for the two - dimensional uncoupled case @xmath119 , the motion is clearly separated in regular ( vortices ) and chaotic around the vortices .",
    "a tracer inside the chaotic region never crosses the regular region",
    ". however , tiny values of @xmath118 are enough to induce a nearly uniform mixing .",
    "this mixing occurs via a spiralling motion ( see @xcite for more details ) .     for the flow described by eq .",

    "plateaus followed by an abrupt break and a very long random walk decay .",
    "the existence of plateaus is induced by the spiralling motion ( trapping tube ) .",
    "after the abrupt break of the plateaus , particles from the fluid performs a random walk clearly characterized by the power - law @xmath124 .",
    "thus the mixing process in the fluid dynamics is mainly governed by a random walk process .",
    "trapping regime for short times , originating plateaus on the rts curves as we found for the _ esm _ in fig .",
    "additionally , the influence of the parameter @xmath118 can be compared to the parameter @xmath7 for the _ esm_. by increasing the parameter the plateaus appear early and become shorter .",
    "another example of this behavior can be found in @xcite , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] . for the model used by the authors",
    ", the interaction of the active particles with the fluid flow induces a complex behavior which can not be reproduced by the individual systems .",
    "the dynamics of the fluid flow alone is composed of a chaotic sea and elliptic islands bounded by kam tori that are impenetrable for the fluid elements .",
    "however , when it is coupled with the active particles dynamics , the swimmers can cross these boundaries .",
    "transport decreases due to the formation of traps that can stuck the swimmers on nearly bounded orbits for long times @xcite , a feature similar to our observation in the _ esm _ dynamics .",
    "furthermore , some of these behaviors of flows and maps can also experimentally be observed for passive scalars in the rayleigh - benard system with oscillatory instability @xcite .",
    "this work uses the rts to describe the regular , mixed and chaotic dynamics in non - hamiltonian @xmath0d volume preserving systems . for this",
    "we use the standard map coupled to an extra - dimension and a continuous fluid flow model .",
    "the standard map is a typical system which allows us to make important general statements about the diffusion process steering the penetration of islands from the @xmath1d case . in our case",
    "we do not have arnold diffusion , but a process similar to the resonance - induced dispersion takes place @xcite .",
    "the general observed behavior for the decays of the rts can be divided in two parts .",
    "firstly , an initial exponential decay due to the chaotic regime @xmath3 . this is a consequence of trajectories which do not touch the regular structure and are of no interest here .",
    "second , the dynamics in the ordered regime @xmath2 ( quase - regular motion ) , which is a consequence of particles which interact with the regular structure .",
    "this part contains power law decays due to sticky effects around the regular structure , plateaus due to trapping inside the regular structures ( in this case a trapping tube or vortices in the fluid flow case ) , and asymptotic exponential decays .",
    "in addition to the above decays , when the mixed dynamics is considered in the extra - dimension , we also observe an abrupt break of the plateau due to a diffusive motion , followed by a random walk .",
    "the trapping times inside the regular structure are clearly recognized by the plateaus in the rts and in the cumulative distribution of consecutive time spend inside the regime @xmath2 .",
    "the large trapping times occur independent of the regular , mixed or chaotic dynamics of the extra - dimension and tends to infinity ( but with decreasing probability to occur ) for smaller and smaller couplings .",
    "the plateau time is shown to be inverse proportional to the coupling strength between the standard map and the extra - dimension . compared to rts in hamiltonian systems , we observe that for mixed @xmath0d volume - preserving systems the asymptotic exponential decays appear naturally ( with one exception for @xmath71 , but we believe this is a question of iteration times ) and that plateaus seem to be a unique property of such @xmath0d non - hamiltonian conservative systems .",
    "scaling properties show that the asymptotic behavior of decays and regimes is independent of the small coupling values .",
    "we also show that plateaus with infinite times appear when tiny dissipation is introduced in the standard map , and are consequences of the larger number of sinks . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard map with a white noise is shown to induce an enhanced power - law decay followed by an asymptotic exponential decays with no plateaus .",
    "the classification technique @xcite of ordered and chaotic regimes allows us to show that all relevant dynamics occurs for the ordered regime , or quasi - regular dynamics .",
    "asymptotic exponential decays of trajectories moving restricted to the boundaries of the islands from the uncoupled case suggest that the dynamics in this system belongs to the mixing one .",
    "further interesting investigations is to use an extra - dimension for which the stable points remain stable . in such case",
    "the diffusion process is expected to differ from the observed here and it may change the asymptotic decay .",
