    "ultra - cold atomic gases in light induced periodic potentials have become an important experimental testing ground for concepts of solid - state and many - body physics since they allow the realization of precisely controllable model hamiltonians with widely tunable parameters .",
    "this development was triggered by the theoretical proposal of jaksch _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite that ultra - cold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice are well described by the bose - hubbard model and the subsequent observation of the superfluid - mott insulator transition in that system by greiner _",
    "a characteristic feature of light induced periodic potentials is the possibility to modify their properties in a simple way .",
    "e.g. when phase locked lasers with different but commensurable frequencies are superimposed to create a periodic dipole potential , different types of superlattices with more complex unit cells can be constructed @xcite .",
    "superimposed optical lattices with non - commensurate frequencies furthermore mimic a disordered potential @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we study the phase diagram of ultra - cold bosons in a one - dimensional superlattice potential with degenerate potential energies and/or degenerate tunneling rates within the unit cell .",
    "for such a system loophole shaped mott - insulator domains with fractional filling have been predicted by buonsante , penna and vezzani @xcite within a multiple - site mean - field approach , as well as with a cell strong - coupling perturbation approach @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the mott lobes at integer filling known from the simple bose - hubbard model , which exist also in the superlattice , the characteristic feature of the loophole insulators is a particle - hole gap that vanishes at zero boson hopping @xmath0 .",
    "so in the @xmath1 phase diagram , where @xmath2 is the chemical potential , these domains touch the @xmath3 line only in a single point .",
    "we here perform numerical simulations using the time evolving block decimation algorithm ( tebd ) introduced by vidal _",
    "@xcite in the infinite system variant @xcite as well as density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations @xcite to determine the boundaries of the different mott - insulating regions in the phase diagram .",
    "we also present a simple effective model that provides a straight forward explanation for the emergence of the loophole insulators by taking into account hopping processes between the sites of degenerate potential energy within a unit cell but neglecting tunneling between different unit cells .",
    "we then study the influence of some additional disorder potential with continuous , bounded distribution .",
    "if the maximum amplitude of the disorder is not too large , the mott lobes shrink in a similar way as for the simple bose - hubbard model @xcite .",
    "also the loophole mott domains shrink . as a consequence near the critical ( fractional ) filling mott - insulating islands",
    "emerge surrounded by a bose - glass phase .",
    "a rather peculiar property of this system is the phase transition from a compressible ( bose - glass ) phase for small values of the bosonic hopping @xmath0 to an incompressible mott phase for larger tunneling rates , i.e. we have a tunneling induced mott insulator .",
    "the effective model describing the full dynamics within a unit cell provides a simple explanation for this and gives good quantitative predictions for the critical value @xmath4 for the compressible - to - mott transition .",
    "the analytical predictions are compared to numerical simulations again using the itebd algorithm for a superlattice with disorder .",
    "we consider ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical superlattice , having a periodic structure with a period @xmath5 of some lattice sites .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the physics of these atoms can be described by the so called superlattice _ bose - hubbard model _ , extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "we here work mostly in the grand canonical bhm , only the calculations of the shape of the loophole insulators in sections [ sec : two - site_without ] and [ sec : two - site ] will be performed for fixed particle numbers . in second quantisation ,",
    "the bhm reads as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the annihilation and creation operators of the bosons at lattice site @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the corresponding number operator .",
    "the particles can tunnel from one lattice site to a neighbouring one with hopping rate @xmath0 , @xmath11 accounts for the variation of the hopping due to the superlattice potential .",
    "@xmath12 accounts for local variations of the potential energy within a unit cell , and @xmath2 is the ( global ) chemical potential .",
    "a particularly interesting situation arises if there is a degeneracy in the tunneling amplitudes and local potentials within the unit cell .",
    "this will be studied in detail in the following . for simplicity",
    "we focus on a special superlattice structure in which only the local potential is varied with period three , namely @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted , that the results obtained for this case are qualitatively identical to the more general case @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "let us consider first a superlattice bhm without disorder in the two cases @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , @xmath21 . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite within a supercell mean - field approach such superlattices lead to loophole shaped insulator phases at fractional bosonic filling . in the following",
    "we will determine the boundaries of these loophole phases numerically and compare them to the mean - field predictions .",
    "furthermore we will present a rather simple model which provides an intuitive explanation .      in order to calculate the boundaries of the mott phases for the superlattice bose hubbard model , we apply the itebd algorithm as described in the appendix to calculate the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ eq : bhm ] ) .",
    "we are able to calculate properties such as the local density @xmath22 as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath2 . using this method to map out the shape of the insulating regions we make use of the fact that for any mott phase the average local density is an exact multiple of @xmath23 , @xmath5 being the period of the superlattice .",
    "thus the phase boundaries can be well approximated by the line where @xmath24 for some @xmath25 ( indicating the order of the lobe ) and some @xmath26 .",
    "] this line can be calculated by finding the value of @xmath2 using a bisection method for a set of given @xmath27 and @xmath0 .",
    "figures [ fig : phase_diagram_nodisorder ] and [ fig : phase_diagram_hopping ] show the results of this approach for the two different superlattice potentials specified above .",
    "the phase diagrams consist of a number of incompressible mott phases , separated by a superfluid region .",
    "in contrast to the bhm for a simple lattice , there are however two types of insulating phases : the lobe - shaped ones , well known from the simple - lattice bose - hubbard model which have a finite extent at @xmath28 and the loophole - shaped ones which vanish at @xmath3 . in general",
    "there are @xmath5 distinct insulating regions for a superlattice of period @xmath5 .",
    "a loophole is present , whenever the local potential @xmath12 is the same for two sites in the same unit cell .",
    "the following section will give a qualitative understanding of these loophole mott regions .",
    "figure [ fig : phase_diagram_nodisorder ] shows our results in the case @xmath18 , @xmath19 , together with the cell strong coupling pertubative expansion ( cscpe ) results from @xcite . as a check of our numerics we added numerical results from a density matrix renormalisation group ( dmrg ) calculation @xcite .",
    "the existence of non integer insulating phases at @xmath3 in this special superlattice has a direct connection to the case of a binary disorder - bhm @xcite , which arises for example in the presence of a second , immobile particle species ( here of filling @xmath29 with an inter species interaction of @xmath30 ) .",
    "+ figure [ fig : phase_diagram_hopping ] shows the numerical results together with the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results and the cscpe data from @xcite .",
    "the agreement between our numerics and the cscpe is naturally good for small @xmath0 but deteriorates for larger @xmath0 .",
    "it is also apparent that while the insulator lobes are rather well described by the cscpe approach , it is much less accurate for the loophole insulator regions , in particular for the case of varying potential depth ( see figure [ fig : phase_diagram_nodisorder ] ) .",
    "we will argue in the following that the loophole insulator phases can entirely be understood from the effective dynamics within a unit cell of the superlattice . to this end",
    "let us discuss the above situation , where @xmath31 , with @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of mott lobes at fractional filling with a finite extend at @xmath3 can easily be understood along the lines of the simple - lattice bhm . as long as the filling is less than @xmath29 the particles",
    "will occupy sites with local potential @xmath33 .",
    "thus the chemical potential reads @xmath34 when the filling reaches the value @xmath29 additional particles will start to occupy sites with local potential @xmath35 , giving rise to a particle - hole gap @xmath36    to explain the existence of the loop - hole insulators , one has to take into account a finite hopping @xmath0 . for @xmath3 any particle added to the system between @xmath37 and @xmath38 increases the total energy by the same amount @xmath35 .",
    "thus the chemical potential stays the same .",
    "this picture changes however when a small but finite tunneling is included . if the filling exceeds the value @xmath29 additional particles experience an effective superlattice potential @xmath39 where the last term results from the interaction with particles already occupying sites with @xmath33 . if @xmath40 the superlattice effectively separates into degenerate double - well problems each corresponding to a unit cell . due to the degeneracy of the double well any small tunneling @xmath0 within the unit cell of the lattice",
    "needs to be taken into account while intra - cell tunneling can be ignored .",
    "a finite tunneling lifts the degeneracy of the single - particle states within the unit cell and leads to a splitting between symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "as long as the filling is less than @xmath41 the particles occupy all sites with the smallest local potential @xmath33 and the symmetric superposition of the double - well @xmath42 .",
    "after that additional particles have to go either to an already occupied side with potential @xmath33 , which is however suppressed by the large repulsive particle - particle interaction , or to the anti - symmetric superposition state .",
    "the latter requires an energy on the order of @xmath43 , thus leading to another particle - hole gap on the order of @xmath0 induced by intra - cell tunneling .",
    "more quantitatively the gap can be calculated by diagonalizing the two - site hamiltonians @xmath44 for zero , one or two particles , ( i.e. @xmath45 ) , which read @xmath46 \\label{eq : h1}\\\\    \\intertext{in the basis $ \\{{\\left| 10 \\right.\\rangle},{\\left| 01 \\right.\\rangle}\\}$ , and }   \\mathcal h(2)=\\left[\\begin{matrix } u+2v_1 & -j\\sqrt2&0\\\\-j\\sqrt2&2v_1&-j\\sqrt2\\\\0&-j\\sqrt2&u+2v_1   \\end{matrix}\\right ]   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in the basis @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting ground state energies are given by @xmath48 calculating the chemical potentials @xmath49 and @xmath50 yields : @xmath51 giving rise to a particle - hole gap @xmath52 a generalisation of this discussion to the case of higher order loophole insulators or larger supercells is straight forward .",
    "for higher order loopholes , the accuracy becomes better , since the difference in the chemical potential between the rightmost and the other sites scales as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of particles of the corresponding mott - insulating lobe .",
    "this means , that the effective two - site model gets even better for higher fillings .",
    "qualitatively , one can understand the change in the shape of the loopholes for higher order ( also see figure [ fig : loops ] ) just by considering the replacement @xmath55 in ( [ eq : h1 ] ) , because the single particle matrix @xmath56 is the only one relevant for the linear part of ( [ eq : gap ] ) and because this replacement is the only influence of the other bosons already filling the lattice on the hopping in @xmath56 .",
    "we now include a small disorder to the superlattice bose hubbard model . of particular interest",
    "is the effect of the disorder to the loophole insulator phases .",
    "disorder can be incorporated into the model by replacing the last part of ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) according to : @xmath57 with @xmath58 being independent random numbers with continuous and bounded distribution , @xmath59 $ ] . in the following",
    "we will restrict our analysis to the case of the superlattice potential @xmath18 , @xmath19 and consider a canonical ensemble .",
    "+      if the disorder is small , i.e. if @xmath60 , the properties of the system in the vicinity of the @xmath61 loophole insulators can again be understood by considering the unit cell only , i.e. within an effective two - site model .",
    "the @xmath61 loophole insulator can be characterized by the number of particles per unit cell @xmath62 and the disorder - modified chemical potential @xmath63 .    defining the total local energy in one unit cell as @xmath64",
    "the two - site hamiltonians can be written as @xmath65 in the basis @xmath66 for one particle less , @xmath67,\\ ] ] in the basis @xmath68 for zero extra particles , and @xmath69\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the basis @xmath70 for one additional particle . + calculating the chemical potentials one has to keep in mind , that the breaking up of the mott - insulator is determined by the smallest particle - hole excitation throughout the whole system",
    ". since all unit cells are decoupled , one has to find the disorder configuration which minimizes the energy gap .",
    "therefore one has to calculate @xmath71,\\label{eq : maximize}\\\\   \\mu^-_{\\frac{3n-1}{3}}=\\underset{\\delta_1,\\delta_2}{\\rm max}\\left [ e_{2n-1}(\\delta_1,\\delta_2)-e_{2n-2}(\\delta_1,\\delta_2)\\right].\\label{eq : minimize }   \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] since the disorder has only an effect on the local energy , we can set @xmath72 .",
    "the corresponding energies are given by @xmath73 minimization ( maximization ) of expressions ( [ eq : maximize ] ) and ( [ eq : minimize ] ) yields @xmath74 in order to calculate the critical tunneling rate at which the loophole insulator emerges , one needs to solve the equation @xmath75 the solution can easily be found and reads @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and @xmath78.\\label{eq : ngt1}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] for @xmath79 . in both cases , the leading terms are given by @xmath80 showing that the loophole decouples from the @xmath3-axis in the presence of disorder , resulting in an insulating island .",
    "it should be noted that the two - site model can not be used to calculate the maximum value of @xmath0 for which the loophole insulator exists since for the vanishing of the gap at large @xmath0 values also inter - cell tunneling processes need to be taken into account .      as seen above from the effective two - site model ,",
    "the loophole insulator regions are decoupled from the @xmath3 axis giving incompressible islands .",
    "although the system is for any given disorder realization not translational invariant , the itebd method can be used also in this case . to this end",
    "we define _ supercells _ each of which with the same disorder .",
    "the supercells have to be large enough such that effects from spatial correlations and finite size can be ignored .",
    "we have chosen a supercell length of 96 . increasing",
    "this length did not show any noticeable changes . to calculate the physical quantities , the numerical results have to be averaged over a number of different disorder realisations , namely over different sets of disorder @xmath81 with @xmath82 $ ] , where a boxed disorder distribution is assumed .",
    "the length of the vector @xmath83 is the same as the size of the system simulated , see appendix .",
    "it turns out that 20 realizations provide sufficient convergence for the purpose of this paper .",
    "figure [ fig : phase_diagram ] shows the results of the itebd calculations both in the pure ( @xmath61 ) and the disordered ( @xmath84 ) case .",
    "the first thing to notice is the shrinking of the mott - insulating lobes for @xmath3 due to the disorder .",
    "as known from the bhm @xcite the mott - lobes shrink by an amount of @xmath85 at the @xmath3 axis .",
    "the second and more important thing to notice is the decoupling of the loophole insulator from the @xmath3 axis , meaning that there is no insulating phase for the respective filling for @xmath86 , in full agreement with equations ( [ eq : nis1 ] , [ eq : ngt1 ] ) .",
    "+ the decoupling of the loophole insulator from the @xmath3 axis can most easily be seen in a cut parallel to the @xmath2-axis for fixed @xmath0 , showing the average local density as a function of the chemical potential . in the case of small",
    "hopping without disorder , this cut shows , beside the expected mott - lobes at @xmath87 and @xmath88 , an intermediate plateau at filling @xmath89 , corresponding to the loophole phase ( figure [ fig : dichte ] , lower plot , solid line ) . for larger hopping ( upper plot , solid line ) , the width of the plateau is slightly increased according to the shape of the loophole in figure [ fig : phase_diagram_nodisorder ] . in the case of disorder , the plateau for @xmath90 vanishes for small hopping ( figure [ fig : dichte ] , lower plot , dashed line ) . for large",
    "hopping ( upper plot , dashed line ) , the incompressible phase survives , however with a largely reduced width compared to the pure case , which shows the decoupling of the loophole from the @xmath3-axis as predicted .",
    "+    in figure [ fig : loops ] we show the numerical results for the first , second and third loophole for increasing values of the normalised disorder amplitude .",
    "it should be noted that due to the finite number of disorder realisations it is difficult to accurately determine the lower tip of the insulating island in the numerics . in figure",
    "[ fig : onset ] we compare the onset of the insulating loopholes obtained from the analytic two - site model with numerical results .",
    "one immediately recognizes two things : first , the onset of the loophole , @xmath91 , is a monotonous function of @xmath92 and second , the higher the filling of the lobe , the earlier the insulating region arises .",
    "the numerical value of @xmath91 was obtained by reading off the values from the numerically determined phase diagram assuming generous error margins .",
    "taking into account these errors , figure [ fig : onset ] shows a rather good agreement of the two - site model to the numerics .",
    "however , the analytic prediction tend to be slightly to large compared to the numerics , nevertheless giving the right leading order for small @xmath92 .",
    "this is because for larger @xmath92 the critical hopping gets larger than allowed by the assumption of a decoupled two - site problem . by diagonalising the complete three - site unit cell with periodic boundary - conditions , which gives another but less intuitive approximation",
    ", we get a curve for @xmath91 that is below the two - site prediction , but is the same in first order and in better agreement with our numerics .",
    "in the present paper we have analyzed the superlattice bose - hubbard model with and without disorder .",
    "in particular the case of degenerate potential energies and/or degenerate tunneling rates within the unit cell of the superlattice have been discussed . using both , exact numerical methods such as the infinite - size time evolving block decimation ( itebd ) algorithm , and the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) we calculated the boundaries of incompressible mott - insulating phases .",
    "the existence of additional loophole - shaped mott domains , predicted before , was verified and their numerically determined phase boundaries compared to other approaches such as the cell strong coupling expansion .",
    "a simple effective model was presented that takes the full dynamics within a unit cell into account .",
    "the model provides a rather straight forward explanation for the emergence of loophole mott domains in the case without disorder . adding a small amount of disorder with continuous , bounded distribution lead to a shrinking of the loopholes to mott insulating islands with the remarkable feature of a compressible to insulating transition with increasing bosonic hopping .",
    "the analytic predictions for the critical hopping for this transition from the effective model were compared to numerical simulations and found in very good agreement .",
    "the authors would like to thank p. buonsante for providing the cscpe and qmc data for the superlattice without disorder .",
