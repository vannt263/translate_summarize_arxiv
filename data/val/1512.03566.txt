    "the two - point correlation function of galaxies , and its fourier transform the power spectrum , have been measured with increasing precision over the last decades .",
    "these observables contain valuable information about the global properties of our universe : its initial conditions , the law of gravity governing its evolution and the amount and nature of dark energy . to a good approximation",
    ", the observed two - point correlation function of galaxies follows the two - point correlation function of the underlying dark matter .",
    "the galaxy correlation function shares therefore the same statistical properties as the dark matter correlation function . in particular",
    "this implies that the galaxy correlation function is isotropic and that its shape depends only on the galaxies separation .",
    "the relation between the galaxy and the dark matter correlation function is simply given via the square of the bias , which in the linear regime is usually assumed to be scale independent .",
    "in this context , measuring the galaxy correlation function allows to directly characterise the distribution of dark matter in our universe .    since the 80 s we know however that this description of the two - point function of galaxies is too simplistic since it does not account for the fact that our observations are made in redshift - space  @xcite . in redshift - space ,",
    "the peculiar velocities of galaxies distort the two - point correlation function . as a consequence",
    "the correlation function is not isotropic anymore : it depends on the orientation of the pair of galaxies with respect to the observer s line - of - sight .",
    "one can show that in the distant - observer approximation , redshift distortions generate a quadrupole and an hexadecapole .",
    "measurements of these multipoles have been performed in various galaxy surveys ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . these measurements",
    "provide additional information on our universe since they are sensitive to the galaxies peculiar velocities .",
    "in particular , combined measurements of the monopole and of the quadrupole allow to measure separately the bias and the growth rate of fluctuations   and @xmath1 . ] .",
    "the fact that we observe in redshift - space is therefore not a complication , but rather an interesting source of information .    in the past few years",
    ", it has been shown that redshift - space distortions are just one of the many distortions that affect the observed distribution of galaxies .",
    "the fractional over - density of galaxies @xmath2 is distorted by gravitational lensing  @xcite , doppler effects , gravitational redshift , sachs - wolfe effects , shapiro time - delay and integrated sachs - wolfe  @xcite .",
    "these terms distort the coordinate system in which our observations are performed ( i.e. redshift and incoming photon s direction ) and they generate consequently additional fluctuations to @xmath2 .",
    "these effects ( apart from lensing and doppler effects ) have been called _ relativistic distortions _ , since they are suppressed by powers of @xmath3 with respect to the standard contributions namely density and redshift - space distortions and they are therefore expected to become relevant at large scales , near the horizon .",
    "a natural question arises then : can we use similar techniques as those developed for redshift - space distortions to _ isolate _ the relativistic distortions from the standard terms ?    in a recent paper  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , we showed that some of the relativistic distortions have a remarkable property : they break the symmetry of the correlation function ( this property has been identified previously in fourier space , where the relativistic distortions generate an imaginary part to the power spectrum  @xcite ) . obviously to observe such a breaking of symmetry we need more that one population of galaxies . in  @xcite",
    ", we showed that the cross - correlation function between a bright and a faint population of galaxies contains in addition to the standard monopole , quadrupole and hexadecapole , a _ dipole _ and an _ octupole _ directly generated by the relativistic distortions .",
    "this suggests that we can isolate the contributions from relativistic distortions by fitting for a dipole and an octupole in the two - point function .",
    "since these new multipoles are orthogonal to the monopole , quadrupole and hexadecapole , this method would allow us to get rid of the dominant standard terms and to target specifically the new relativistic terms .",
    "in essence this is very similar to the method used in  @xcite to measure gravitational redshift in clusters and to separate it from the dominant doppler redshift .    in this paper , we calculate the detectability of the relativistic distortions in large - scale structure using this method .",
    "we construct an optimal estimator to isolate the dipole .",
    "we then calculate the signal - to - noise for the dipole in a multi - population case and we show that our optimal estimator allows us to improve the measurement of the relativistic distortions by up to 35 percent . in a survey with halos and number densities similar to those of the millennium simulation",
    "we expect a cumulative signal - to - noise of 4.4 .",
    "for the main galaxy sample of sdss ( dr5 ) at low redshift we can reach a cumulative signal - to - noise of 2.4 .",
    "finally we forecast a cumulative signal - to - noise of 7.4 in the upcoming dark energy spectroscopic instrument ( desi ) survey .",
    "this demonstrates the feasibility of our method to current and future surveys .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it does not require to measure the correlation function at extremely large scales , of the size of the horizon . by fitting for a dipole we can indeed isolate the relativistic distortions from the standard terms at scales accessible by current surveys .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follow : in section  [ sec : multipop ] we construct a general estimator combining different populations of galaxies , which isolates the anti - symmetric part of the correlation function . in section  [ sec : variance ] we derive the variance of this estimator . in section  [ sec : opt ] we find the kernel which minimises the variance . in section  [ sec : signaltonoise ] we calculate the signal - to - noise of the dipole and in section  [ sec : measurement ] we forecast our method to the millennium simulation , the main galaxy sample of sdss and the desi survey .",
    "to measure anti - symmetric terms in the two - point correlation function we need more than one population of galaxies .",
    "if all galaxies are the same , we have indeed by construction that @xmath4 is symmetric under the exchange of the two galaxies in the pair .",
    "if however we split the galaxies into multiple populations with different characteristics , e.g. different luminosities , then the cross - correlation between two populations with respective luminosities @xmath5 and @xmath6 can have an anti - symmetric part _",
    "l ( , z)_l( , z)_l( , z)_l ( , z ) .",
    "the goal of this paper is to construct an estimator which isolates the anti - symmetric part of the correlation function .",
    "we start by splitting the galaxies depending on their luminosity . for each pixel @xmath7 in the sky",
    ", we then count how many galaxies we have at each luminosity ( or in each bin of luminosity ) .",
    "let us denote this number by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the luminosity of the population under consideration and @xmath10 is the position of the pixel  .",
    "for example @xmath11 .",
    "for simplicity we drop the dependence on @xmath12 in the notation , when it is not needed . ] .",
    "the overdensity of galaxies in pixel @xmath7 with luminosity @xmath9 is then n_l_i(_i)=n_l_i(_i)-d|n_l_i , where @xmath13 denotes the mean number of galaxies per pixel , with luminosity @xmath9 .",
    "note that @xmath13 depends on the size of the pixels .",
    "the most general estimator we can construct , combining all populations of galaxies , is then   by @xmath13 , as is usually done for auto - correlations .",
    "the reason is that @xmath13 depends on luminosity and dividing by this factor is similar to applying a weighting to the different populations .",
    "such a factor should therefore be included in the general kernel @xmath14 . ]",

    "denotes the so - called lensing magnification bias which depends on the slope of the luminosity function @xmath27 and the last term encodes all the relativistic distortions .",

    "a dot denotes derivative with respect to conformal time @xmath21 . in theories of gravity where euler equation is valid",
    ", we can rewrite the gradient of the potential as a function of velocity and we obtain [ deltarel_euler ] n_l_i^rel(_i)= -d|n_l_i(+ ) . here and in the following we neglect for simplicity the contribution proportional to the slope of the luminosity function in eq .  , i.e. we set @xmath28 .",
    "we also work in the distant - observer approximation and neglect evolution effects .",
    "this means that the only anti - symmetric contribution is due to the relativistic distortions in eq .  .",
    "in  @xcite we calculated the anti - symmetric signal due to the effect of evolution .",
    "we found that this contribution is negligible , see figure 11 of  @xcite . in a companion paper  @xcite , we discuss in detail the importance of the wide - angle contribution .",
    "we show that with the appropriate choice of kernel the wide - angle contribution remains always slightly smaller than the relativistic contributions , see figure 3 of  @xcite left panel . since the wide - angle contribution is of opposite sign to the relativistic contributions , its main effect is to slightly decrease the amplitude of the total anti - symmetric signal . in the following we neglect the wide - angle contribution for simplicity .",

    "measuring relativistic distortions would therefore open the way to new tests of the theory of gravity .",
    "these effects are however challenging to detect since they are suppressed by powers of @xmath3 with respect to the standard contributions . to observe the impact of relativistic distortions on the monopole , quadrupole and hexadecapole , we need therefore to look at correlation functions at horizon scales @xmath115 .    in this paper",
    "we propose instead to isolate the relativistic distortions by fitting for a dipole in the cross - correlation function between multiple populations of galaxies .",
    "the advantage of using the dipole to measure relativistic distortions is twofolds .",
    "first , this allows us to remove the contribution from the standard terms , which in the distant - observer approximation affect only the even multipoles .",
    "second , the kernel to isolate the dipole is anti - symmetric in the exchange of the galaxies luminosity , which automatically suppresses the cosmic variance contribution to the error .    combining multiple populations of galaxies , we construct an optimal estimator to maximise the signal - to - noise of the dipole .",
    "this estimator has a complicated form , which involves multiple summations over all pixels in the survey , as shown in eq .  .",
    "in a forthcoming paper we will study how to implement efficiently this estimator in large - scale structure surveys . here instead we restrict ourself to the case where poisson sampling dominates the error . in this case",
    ", the estimator takes a simple and intuitive form , which can readily be used .",
    "we find that with this simple estimator we increase the signal - to - noise of the dipole by up to 35 percent .",
    "this allows us to reach a detectable level for the dipole in the main sdss sample of galaxies and in surveys with number densities and halos similar to the one in the millennium simulation . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we will apply this method to the data release dr5 of sdss and to the mice simulation .",
    "this will require to split the galaxies into multiple populations with different luminosities and to combine these populations according to eq .  . in the future we will also try and measure the dipole in the upcoming desi survey for which we predict a cumulative signal - to - noise of 7.4 .",
    "a detection of the relativistic dipole with this method would be very interesting since it would allow us to test the validity of euler equation in a model independent way . according to eq .",
    "the dipole is indeed sensitive to a combination of the gravitational potential @xmath19 and the peculiar velocity of galaxies .",

    "<S> it has been shown recently that relativistic distortions generate a dipolar modulation in the two - point correlation function of galaxies . to measure this relativistic dipole </S>",
    "<S> it is necessary to cross - correlate different populations of galaxies with for example different luminosities or colours . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we construct an optimal estimator to measure the dipole with multiple populations . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this estimator increases the signal - to - noise of the dipole by up to 35 percent . using 6 populations of galaxies , in a survey with halos and number densities similar to those of the millennium simulation </S>",
    "<S> , we forecast a cumulative signal - to - noise of 4.4 . for the main galaxy sample of sdss at low redshift @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> our optimal estimator predicts a cumulative signal - to - noise of 2.4 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we forecast a cumulative signal - to - noise of 7.4 in the upcoming desi survey . </S>",
    "<S> these forecasts indicate that with the appropriate choice of estimator the relativistic dipole should be detectable in current and future surveys . </S>"
