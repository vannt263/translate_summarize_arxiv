    "at low and intermediate energies , considered in the present study , the neutral - current neutrino - nucleus processes are described by the matrix elements of an effective interaction hamiltonian , written in terms of the leptonic @xmath5 and hadronic ( nuclear ) @xmath6 currents as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the fermi constant .",
    "the matrix element of the leptonic current , between an initial @xmath9 and a final lepton state @xmath10 takes the usual v - a form @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the neutrino flavour and @xmath13 denoting the three momentum transfer .",
    "the hadronic matrix element is obtained through a multipole decomposition as described in refs .",

    "it can be noticed that the cenns cross section is rather sensitive to the neutron form factor , calculable in the context of a nuclear structure model . in this work",
    ", the reliability of the evaluated cross sections is maximised by performing qrpa calculations , incorporating realistic strong nuclear forces within the framework of a comprehensive phenomenological meson - exchange theory for the reliable description of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ( e.g. the bonn full model , bfm )  @xcite .",

    "the off - shell behaviour of bonn c - d is based upon the relativistic feynman amplitudes for meson - exchange ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 mesons in our case ) , a fact that has attractive consequences in nuclear structure applications  @xcite .",
    "motivated by its successful application on similar calculations for various semi - leptonic nuclear processes @xcite , the qrpa method is employed in this work to construct explicitly the nuclear ground state , @xmath36 , of the studied even - even isotope ( @xmath37ge in our case ) through the numerical solution of the bcs equations .",

    "recently , it became feasible to detect neutrino - nucleus scattering events by using high purity germanium - based detectors , hpge  @xcite .",
    "here , we are interested in the possibility of probing the existence of a fourth light sterile neutrino through potential deviations on the low - energy cenns measurements at reactor neutrino experimental facilities , such as texono  @xcite , @xmath4gen  @xcite , gemma  @xcite , connie  @xcite and miner  @xcite . in this work ,",

    "sterile neutrino mass schemes have been considered in the literature with various motivations .",
    "an attractive possibility are the early 2 + 2 models  @xcite .",
    "while they still constitute probably one of the most interesting sterile extensions of the standard model , their original motivation is gone . on the other hand , they are strongly restricted by solar and atmospheric data and do not allow for the ev - scale neutrino mass we are interested here  @xcite .",
    "for this reason we focus on the ( 3 + 1 ) scheme , which does allow for ev - neutrino masses as long as the doublet - singlet mixing angles are adequately small , so that the sterile state decouples from both solar and atmospheric conversions , a possibility absent in the 2 + 2 schemes .",

    "atmospheric driven oscillations can be neglected and the neutrino survival probability can be effectively parametrised as @xmath77",

    "we mention that @xmath96 is independent of the detector mass and inevitable flux uncertainties .",

    ". for comparison , also shown is the corresponding sensitivity region in the @xmath109 plane for the case of the coherent experiment assuming its `` current '' setup ( see below ) .",
    "our present results indicate clearly that a dedicated experiment searching for cenns has also satisfactory capabilities to probe sterile neutrinos . for the case of the texono experiment , the lack of @xmath47 disappearance results in the sensitivity regions depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig.sterile ] .",
    "the results are illustrated for three different values of the @xmath37ge target mass ( 1  kg , 10  kg , 100  kg ) , four possible energy thresholds ( @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath108 , @xmath112 ) and one year of data taking time .",
    "we note that , by assuming a threshold as high as @xmath113 , the results show that texono has no sensitivity to the sterile parameters for the case of a @xmath37ge detector with 1  kg of mass .",
    "one sees that large values of @xmath114 would be ruled out by the exclusion curves , in agreement with the results of refs .",
    "in addition , as stated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the requirement of large @xmath115 for solar neutrino oscillations , implies that values of @xmath116 close to unity are excluded .",
    "therefore , for small @xmath114 one has @xmath117 which satisfies the general expectation that the fourth generation massive neutrino is mostly sterile .    at this point",
    "we turn our attention on the capability of the coherent experiment  @xcite at the sns , oak ridge , to probe the sterile neutrino parameters ( for a comprehensive analysis , see also ref .",
    "although sns experiments in general involve both @xmath78 and @xmath79 , here we focus just on the latter .",
    "figure  [ fig.sterile-coherent ] shows the resulting sensitivities on @xmath118 obtained by assuming only the @xmath55 component of the delayed flux .",
    "the calculation corresponds to a @xmath37ge target located 20  m far from the source for ( i ) the `` current '' configuration : 100  kg of detector mass , a threshold of @xmath119 and a running time of @xmath120s , and ( ii ) the `` future '' configuration : 1  ton of detector mass , a threshold of @xmath121 and 1 year of data taking time ( see also ref .",
    "the obtained results , in conjunction with the large values of @xmath122 that are indicated by atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite , imply small values of @xmath123 .",
    "then , similarly to reactor neutrino experiments , one may write @xmath124 furthermore , a combination of eq.([sin_ab ] ) with eqs.([sin_e - e ] ) and ( [ sin_mu - mu ] ) yields the appearance - disappearance constraint  @xcite @xmath125 which implies that @xmath126 is doubly suppressed for small values of @xmath127 and @xmath118 . from the corresponding exclusion curve in fig .",
    "[ fig.theta_emu ] , we find that a combined analysis results into a high sensitivity to sterile neutrino searches .",
    "confronting the present results with the respective allowed regions extracted from lsnd  @xcite and miniboone  @xcite data , we conclude that the expected sensitivity from cenns is generically higher .",
    "these results are also competitive with recent sterile neutrino fits from global analyses of sbl neutrino oscillation searches  @xcite .",
    "we have examined the potential of short - baseline coherent elastic neutrino - nucleus scattering experiments in probing effects associated to light sterile neutrinos . for definiteness",

    "we have found that the planned texono and coherent experiments offer good prospects of providing key information concerning the existence of light sterile neutrinos . from our present results",
    "we conclude that dedicated low - energy neutrino experiments looking for cenns events could be complementary to charged - current appearance and disappearance searches .",
    "we have also verified that , by employing high - purity germanium detectors with sub - kev thresholds , better sensitivities can be reached on the sterile neutrino mixing parameters .",
