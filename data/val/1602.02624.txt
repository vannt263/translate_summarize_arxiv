    "capacitively coupled plasmas ( ccps ) have a wide range of applications , most of which require a solid control of the ion properties , i.e. the ion flux and the mean ion energy , at the electrode ( target ) surfaces @xcite . during the past decades different schemes , which allow a separate control of these quantities , have been proposed .",
    "radio frequency discharges driven simultaneously by two significantly different frequencies have approached this issue by the functional separation of the two components of the driving voltage waveform : the high frequency component plays the dominant role for the generation of the plasma and , thereby , sets the ion flux , while the low frequency component is responsible for accelerating the ions towards the electrodes , i.e. it defines the mean energy of the ions at the surfaces @xcite . a more recent approach , based on the electrical asymmetry effect ( eae ) @xcite makes use of the generation of a controllable dc self - bias that develops even in geometrically symmetric reactors when the discharge is excited by the sum of two ( or more ) consecutive harmonics of a base frequency .",
    "the control over the dc self - bias , @xmath0 , and over the mean ion energy by changing the phase angles of the applied harmonics has been confirmed both experimentally @xcite and in simulations @xcite , and has been proven benefitial in thin film deposition applications @xcite . while these basic approaches and their variants @xcite allow controlling these two integral characteristics of the ion flux - energy distribution function ( idf ) , a control over the _ shape _ of the idf would be highly desirable , e.g. to drive energy - selective surface processes at a distinct ion energy @xcite . for such applications ,",
    "customizing the idf to form a narrow peak at controllable energies would be ideal .",
    "under collisionless conditions , the idf in a single - frequency ccp typically exhibits a double peak feature at high energies @xcite , whereas collisions lead to a more complex spectrum at lower energies @xcite .",
    "typically , the peaks are formed by 10 % - 20 % of all ions flowing to the electrode @xcite .",
    "so far , a control over the idf shape has only been realized in high density remote plasma sources with unmatched arbitrary substrate bias @xcite at low repetition rates ( @xmath1 100 khz ) for ion extraction .",
    "while this concept is not applicable for large area ccp sources , the several degrees of freedom in the case of eae - type excitation waveforms may provide a possibility to go beyond the control of the flux and mean energy , i.e. towards the optimization of the complete idf in ccps via a specific tuning of the amplitudes and phases of the individual frequency components of the driving voltage .",
    "the work presented here proposes such a tailoring of the idf , via utilizing the effect of charge exchange ( cx ) collisions on the idf @xcite in ccps driven by customized voltage waveforms .",
    "it will be demonstrated that ( i ) a narrow peak in the idf can be obtained under such conditions via adjusting the ion dynamics for our needs , and ( ii ) the position of this peak ( i.e. the energy ) and the corresponding ion flux can be controlled via the driving voltage waveform .",
    "it is of key importance that cx collisions `` convert '' fast ions to slow ions , which can accumulate in the sheath regions until a high electric field drives them to the electrodes .",
    "we note that at low pressures a narrow ion energy distribution can also be generated in single - frequency ccps if ( nearly ) collisionless conditions for the sheaths can be reached @xcite .",
    "the energy of the ions in this case is , however , defined by the mean sheath voltage , so it occurs at the high energy end of the idf .",
    "these conditions are far from ideal for deposition processes , which require a high voltage ( high ion flux ) and , at the same time , a peak of the idf at low / intermediate energies to enhance particular surface reactions .",
    "this can not be realized in classical ccps , but it is facilitated based on the technique proposed here .",
    "we investigate the possibility of the idf tailoring via self - consistent kinetic simulations based on the particle - in - cell technique complemented with monte carlo treatment of collision processes ( pic / mcc ) .",
    "we use our 1d3v electrostatic , bounded plasma simulation code@xcite to study a geometrically symmetric discharge in helium at 6 pa and 350 k. the plane , parallel , and infinite electrodes are separated by a distance of 5.0 cm . at the electrodes , electrons are reflected with a probability of 0.2 @xcite and secondary electrons due to ion impact are generated with a probability of @xmath2 .",

    "the idea is that the powered electrode sheath remains collapsed for a long time , so that ions created by cx collisions ( which we call `` cx - ions '' below ) within the sheath region can accumulate in front of the electrode .",

    "the position of the peak can be tuned within a 27 ev  130 ev range by varying the excitation voltage amplitude by a factor of 3 .",
    "the flux of the ions that belong to this peak changes by a factor of 6 .",
    "the relative contribution of the flux of the ions within the peak to the total ion flux also increases , from 15.1 % at @xmath260.5 to 21.1 % at @xmath26 1.5 .",

    "the relatively high flux observed in the smallest energy bin ( below 1 ev ) is caused by cx ions that are created very close to the electrode . a large fraction of these ions gains only very little energy , as the sheath electric field is small for almost the entire second half of the rf period .",

    "we seed cx - ions , which are initially at rest , into the sheath electric field , which is predefined as a result of the pic / mcc simulations .",
    "we assign the arrival energy of the ions at the electrode ( neglecting collisions ) to each position in space ( between @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) and time within the sheath region , where the ions started @xcite .",
    "this construction is shown in figure [ fig:5 ] for the @xmath13 case . a large domain in this plot , where the ion energy is nearly the same ( @xmath29 ev , marked by the white rectangle ) , gives rise to the nearly monoenergetic peak in the idf .",
    "this domain establishes because the electric field is strong for a short time , after which it oscillates around an intermediate value and is almost zero between @xmath30 @xmath24 and @xmath31 @xmath24 .",
    "thus , cx - ions can accumulate in this time interval close to the electrode .",
    "these ions are suddenly accelerated by the following peak in the sheath electric field and arrive at the electrode after gaining energy between @xmath31 @xmath24 and @xmath32 @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , all cx - ions created within the window @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath24 and @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 arrive with about the same energy , resulting in the distinct peak observed in the idf .",
    "ions , which start from a position further away from the electrode , need more than one rf period to move through the sheath and , therefore , contribute to the idf at higher energies ; they do not cause another distinct peak due to ( i ) the lower electric field at the starting position , leading to a much longer transition time , so ( ii ) the probability of collisions is high , redistributing these ions in the idf .",
    "an increase in the voltage factor simply enhances the sheath electric field and , thereby , enhances both the spatial region , in which ions must be initially located in order to contribute to the peak in the idf , and the energy of this peak due to the stronger force exerted on the ions . in this way the shape and the energy of the peak can be controlled .    ) , discharge voltage including dc self - bias ( @xmath8 ) , and voltage drop over the powered electrode sheath ( @xmath9 ) , for voltage plateau values of ( a ) 0 % , ( b ) 50 % , and ( c ) 100 % , i.e. voltage parameters specified in table [ table1 ] .",

    "increasing the pv leads to an increase of the voltage drop across the powered electrode sheath and , hence , to an increase of the idf width to up to 318 ev .",

    ".    at small pvs ( e.g. 0% ) , the long time interval of a small sheath voltage and , hence , of a small electric field leads to many cx - ions accumulating in the sheath region at the powered electrode .",
    "however , only a small fraction of these ions arrive at the electrode after a sufficiently short transit time .",
    "thus , the collection of cx - ions within a transit time of one rf period or less is very inefficient . with an intermediate pv ( e.g. 50 % ) ,",
    "this collection is improved , but the longer time interval of a significant sheath electric field also means a shorter accumulation phase .",
    "a high pv ( e.g. 100 % ) allows for a larger energy gain of cx - ions , so that the respective peak in the idf is shifted towards higher energies .",
    "meanwhile , the relative contribution of the flux of the ions within the peak to the total ion flux slightly decreases , from 17.2 % at pv= 50 % to 16.2 % at pv= 100 % .    in both variations shown in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:7 ] ,",
    "the main peak is superimposed on a broad spectrum of the idf .",
    "a further increase of the relative flux of the dominant peak would be worthwhile and might be achievable by changing more parameters , such as the gas pressure or the fundamental driving frequency .",
    "such a wide parameter variation is beyond the scope of this work , though .",
    "furthermore , there are further peaks at higher energies , which are caused by cx ions that are created further away from the electrode and have a transit time of multiple rf periods .",
    "therefore , the development of multiple peaks is inherently linked to the periodic behavior of the rf sheath @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these peaks are much less pronounced , because the spatial regions , in which cx ions may accumulate , become narrow far away from the electrode ( see figure [ fig:5 ] ) and because the probability of collisions , in which the energy of these ions is redistributed , becomes larger .",
    "certainly , the application of the approach discussed here is limited to gases with a symmetrical charge exchange between the primary ion species and the feed gas .",
    "in conclusion , in this work we presented a novel method to generate a distinct peak at low / intermediate energies in the flux - energy distribution of the ions impinging on the electrode surfaces in capacitive multi - frequency plasmas .",
    "this was made possible by driving the plasma with a tailored voltage waveform that consists of five consecutive harmonics .",
    "subject to the electrical asymmetry effect , a dc self - bias develops as a function of the phases between the applied harmonics .",
    "we have shown that by adjusting the applied voltage waveform to approximate certain idealized waveforms , the overall shape of the idf , as well as distinct features within the distribution function can be controlled .",
    "we found that utilizing the effect of charge exchange collisions of the ions in the sheaths , a dominant peak in the idf can be created .",
    "this approach works via a detailed knowledge of the ion dynamics within the sheath and is , in particular , based on a control of the dynamics of cx - ions in the spatio - temporal sheath electric field . the general idea of dividing the rf period into intervals of cx - ion accumulation ( small sheath electric field ) and collection ( high and intermediate sheath electric field ) was tested and the resulting peak in the idf was analyzed .",
    "it was found that the position ( i.e. the energy ) and the flux of the peak can be varied at the same time by adjusting the amplitude of the applied voltage waveform , and can be controlled almost independently of one another by changing the pv of the intermediate voltage plateau .",
    "these advanced control opportunities allow the generation and control of a single peak at low / medium energies within the idf , so that certain energy - selective reaction process at the substrate surface induced by ion bombardment within a distinct energy window can be specifically enhanced , while the risk of inducing other potentially parasitic reactions initiated by ions at different energies is reduced .",
    "certainly , this study is a proof of principle and the method needs to be tested , e.g. for other feed gases , in a future study .",
