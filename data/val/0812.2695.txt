    "ii superconducting films in perpendicular fields.@xcite a difference is that the first critical field for films vanishes for macroscopically large samples.@xcite    an interesting class of systems which have attracted a great attention only recently are ferromagnet  superconductor hybrid systems .",
    "there one examines the influence of a material with heterogeneous magnetization on a superconductor.@xcite direct contact between the magnetic material and the superconductor is avoided usually by a thin insulating layer which suppresses the proximity effect .",
    "these hybrid systems can be fabricated fully controlling their parameters.@xcite inhomogeneous magnetization of ferromagnets generates magnetic field that penetrates the superconductor . as a response to that field , supercurrents ( and vortices under certain conditions ) are induced in the film .",
    "the magnetic field of supercurrents interacts with the magnetic subsystem .",
    "therefore by tuning parameters of the magnetic subsystem we examine different phenomena of the composite system .",
    "hybrid systems offer a number of realizations of new interesting phenomena which include pinning of magnetization induced vortices , commensurability effects ( between external magnetic field and periodic structure of magnetic material ) on the superconductor resistivity and others.@xcite    in this paper we are focused on the simplest ferromagnet  superconductor hybrid system which consists of a single magnetic dot grown on top of a type  ii superconducting film . the magnetic dot is assumed to have permanent magnetization normal to the film surface . despite its simplicity",
    "this system deserves attention since a diversity of different ground states can be realized in the parameter space .",
    "dots with sufficiently small magnetization produce only supercurrents in the film , while with the increase of magnetization different configurations of vortex states appear in the ground state(gs).@xcite this is in striking contrast with respect to films in homogeneous fields.@xcite however , we expect that for large dot radii any magnetization induces vortices in the film , like the case with homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "the main goal in this paper is to define regions in the parameter space with different ground state configurations of vortices .",
    "a possible question that is under debate in literature is whether antivortices may also be induced in the film .",
    "one finds different statements about the presence of antivortices : while some authors claim its existence,@xcite the others do not find it.@xcite we think that rough estimates in ref .",

    "magnetization of the dot ( which is normal to the film surface ) produces magnetic field in the film , which is under the dot parallel to the magnetization , but antiparallel for larger distances than the dot radius .",
    "the magnetic field under the dot favors the appearance of vortices under the dot , the appearance of antivortices outside the dot . whether some vortex  antivortex configuration have the smallest energy or not depends on details of the interaction energy .",
    "vortices have spatial structure and the superconducting order parameter vanishes roughly at distances smaller than @xmath0 around the center of the vortex . here",
    "@xmath0 denotes the coherence length of a superconductor.@xcite the nonlinear ginzburg ",
    "landau approach takes this into account , but apart from numerical treatment one can hardly get analytic results.@xcite our approach is based on london ",
    "maxwell equations.@xcite despite its simplicity ( it treats vortices as point objects ) it an useful approach since one may get analytic expressions for relevant quantities which are asymptotically exact when all lengths in the problem are larger than the spatial vortex extension .",
    "it is interesting to mention that the vortex nucleation in superconducting microtriangles and squares occurs in such a way that the symmetry of the superconductor is preserved.@xcite for example in the case of a triangle , the state with total vorticity two is realized with three vortices and a single antivortex in the center of the triangle and preserves @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "our system with infinite superconducting film and with magnetic dot on top of it has rotational @xmath2 symmetry around the dot center .",
    "this symmetry is reduced in the presence of vortices and antivortices contrary to the abovementioned example . for the most possible symmetric states with total vorticity zero",
    "the rotational symmetry is either reduced to discrete @xmath3 symmetry ( for the case of @xmath4 single vortices and antivortices ) or does not exist at all ( for a vortex ",
    "antivortex pair ) .",
    "when two and more ( we have checked up to four ) vortices and antivortices are present in the zero vorticity state , vortices are distributed in a symmetric fashion around the dot center while antivortices are outside the dot in the same manner , like homothetically transformed vortices . in the case of a single vortex ",
    "antivortex pair , the dot s center , vortex and antivortex are collinear .",
    "other states with nonzero vorticity are less symmetric . when the number of antivortices is five and more , they may form shells around a central vortex in zero vorticity states.@xcite    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce a theoretical model we use to describe the system .",
