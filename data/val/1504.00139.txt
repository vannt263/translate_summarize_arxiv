    "in many open quantum system approaches , the microscopic model underlying the environment consists of an infinite number of harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to system degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the flexibility of this particular model is owed to the fact that both spectrum and frequency - dependent coupling of the environmental modes can be adjusted to reproduce features observed in experiments , e.g.  to describe the effect of polar solvents on dyes @xcite or to treat vibrational modes of molecules @xcite .",
    "the spectrum and the frequency - dependent coupling can be encoded in a quantity called spectral density ( sd ) , which is a real function of frequency .",
    "the influence of the environment on the system is eventually determined by the bath correlation function ( bcf ) @xcite , which quantifies temporal correlations of environmental degrees of freedom . via the initial state of the environment ,",
    "environment temperature is incorporated in the bcf .",
    "the partitioning of the total system into explicitly treated degrees of freedom and a rest which is treated by means of a bcf is not fixed in the first place , and different choices might be expedient from different ( computational ) points of view @xcite .",
    "that is , in the simulation of molecules embedded in an environment , one might explicitly include one or more strongly coupled ( important ) vibrational modes in the system part and treat the remaining part effectively .",
    "alternatively , one could consider only the electronic degrees of freedom of the molecules as system part , which in turn are coupled to a highly structured environment .",
    "the very same considerations apply in the case of some electronic degrees of freedom being coupled to an imperfect ( lossy ) cavity @xcite .",
    "while an unstructured environment is more easily handled in simulations , the rapid growth of the hilbert space associated with the explicitly treated environmental modes makes the second choice the favorable one .",
    "the effect of different system - environment partitioning has already been discussed in literature @xcite , however , the discussion mostly focused on the sd . in this work ,",
    "we study how the bcf transforms under different system - environment partitionings .",
    "in particular , we examine the effect of two different initial states , a factorizing and a correlated one , on the transformed bcf .",
    "we consider an exemplary model consisting of a harmonic bath coupled to a single mode , called `` pseudomode '' ( pm ) .",
    "( see ref .   for a discussion of how a pm relates to a vibrational mode . )",
    "this pm we then couple to another harmonic oscillator that acts as a system , thus allowing us to study the influence of the different bcfs on a system dynamics . for strong coupling between pm and both system oscillator and ohmic bath",
    "we find pronounced differences in the dynamics of the mean occupation number of the system oscillator , thus stressing the importance to take heed of the initial state of the composite system in this regime .",

    "lastly , we review in appendix  [ sec : app_heisenberg_eqns ] an alternative derivation of the transformed bcfs on grounds of the heisenberg equations of motion and state a numerical recipe to solve the occurring integro - differential equation .",

    "our numerical simulations show for different initial environment states pronounced differences in the transient dynamics of a system that via a pm strongly couples to an ohmic bath .",

    "by contrast , for a factorizing initial state these properties do not apply , owed to the non - stationarity of the bcf in this case . only after a transient equilibration dynamics that can induce different system dynamics ,",
    "they are recovered .",
