    "phase transition is an interesting phenomenon which appears in various physical systems . in nuclear systems with the excitation energies of a few to ten mev / nucleon ,",
    "the existence of the liquid - gas phase transition has been speculated based on the resemblance between the equation of state ( eos ) of homogeneous nuclear matter and the van der waals eos .",
    "however , the confirmation of the phase transition for realistic nuclear systems requires more careful arguments .",
    "first of all , any nuclear system accessible by experiments consists of a finite number of nucleons .",
    "because of this , it may be generally believed that the phase transition tends to be smeared out due to the finite size effect , which is a correct statement for canonical ensembles specified by temperature .",
    "however , by studying microcanonical ensembles with fixed energies , a quite prominent signal of the phase transition is expected in finite systems , that is backbending ( or negative heat capacity ) in caloric curves @xcite .",
    "many experimental and theoretical works have been devoted to search for such a signal in various physical systems @xcite .",
    "another complexity comes from the fact that the excited systems for the study of nuclear liquid - gas phase transition are produced in dynamical processes of nuclear reactions in laboratories .",
    "in fact , it is considered that the liquid - gas phase transition is somehow related to the multifragmentation phenomenon which is observed in the various nuclear reactions , such as in the relatively low energy region where the neck or midrapidity component may be created in dissipative binary reactions @xcite , in higher energy central collisions where clusters are produced copiously in expanding system @xcite , and also in peripheral collisions where the excited projectile - like fragment breaks up into pieces @xcite .",
    "thus intensive studies have been done to search evidences of the phase transition in these experimental data and some of the works have reported that indications of the phase transition have been obtained @xcite .",
    "however , the conclusion has not come yet and much efforts are still required .",
    "the difficulty is due to the nontrivial dynamical effects contained in the experimental data .",
    "even though it may be true that the part of the system is equilibrated in good approximation as is indicated by the success of statistical models @xcite , the ambiguities enter in the data analysis through the identification of the equilibrated thermal source . on the other hand ,",
    "there are several models which can predict the experimental observables without such ambiguities by simulating the dynamics of these reactions microscopically @xcite . by carefully studying the time evolution of dynamical reactions",
    ", it may be possible to discuss how well the thermalization is achieved in dynamical collisions and how the results of dynamical reactions are related to the thermal properties , such as phase transition .",
    "for this purpose , the dynamical models should correctly describe the thermal properties as well as dynamical reaction mechanisms .",
    "it can be verified by applying these models directly to the ideal systems in thermal equilibrium , though the attempts for this direction have not been done sufficiently .",
    "the aim of the present work is to demonstrate that the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition in ideal thermal equilibrium can be described by antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) which is a microscopic dynamical model based on the degrees of freedom of interacting nucleons @xcite .",
    "we utilize the same amd model that has been applied to nuclear collisions and successfully reproduced various aspects of experimental data @xcite .    to achieve this aim , the equilibrated systems are constructed and their statistical properties are studied in the following way .",
    "firstly , we prepare the initial state putting @xmath0 nucleons ( @xmath1 neutrons and @xmath2 protons ) arbitrarily within a fixed radius @xmath3 , and solve the time evolution of the system by amd for a long time . in order to confine the system in the container of volume @xmath4",
    ", we introduce a certain reflection process at the container wall .",
    "then we regard the state at each time as a sample of the statistical ensemble with energy @xmath5 , volume @xmath6 and particle number @xmath7 .",
    "it should be emphasized that this ensemble is a microcanonical ensemble with a fixed energy @xmath5 because the initial energy @xmath5 is conserved through the amd time evolution . by extracting the statistical information ( temperature @xmath8 and pressure @xmath9 ) from the ensembles",
    ", we can construct the caloric curves .",
    "the existence of the liquid - gas phase transition can be checked by finding a part with negative heat capacity ( backbending ) in these caloric curves , which is the characteristic feature of first order phase transition for finite systems@xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of the present study as a statistical model , compared to conventional statistical models @xcite , is that the calculation is based on the nucleon - nucleon interaction , rather than the nuclear binding energies and level densities given externally .",
    "another advantage is that the interactions among fragment nuclei and nucleons are naturally taken into account , while they are usually ignored in other statistical models by the freeze - out assumption .",
    "there have been several discussions on the question whether molecular dynamics models can describe the statistical properties of nuclear systems for which quantum and fermionic features are essential @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that molecular dynamics can be consistent with the quantum and fermionic caloric curve if the wave function is fully antisymmetrized and an appropriate quantum branching process is taken into account @xcite .",
    "there are several works @xcite that studied the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition using molecular dynamics models and some of the works claimed that a clear signal of phase transition , namely plateau or backbending in the caloric curves , is obtained .",
    "however , the molecular dynamics models utilized in these works have not been successfully applied to the dynamical multifragmentation reactions .",
    "another problem is that the effective interactions adopted in these works sometimes do not satisfy the saturation property of infinite nuclear matter and none of them succeeded in obtaining plateau or backbending with an appropriate effective interaction so far .",
    "furthermore , these works have calculated the constant volume caloric curves or those with a harmonic oscillator confining potential but have not explicitly shown the constant pressure caloric curves for which plateau or backbending is expected most clearly . on the other hand",
    ", our present study uses the same framework of amd ( amd / ds ) that has already been utilized for nuclear collision simulations @xcite and the gogny force @xcite as the effective interaction between nucleons , which satisfies the saturation property of infinite nuclear matter .",
    "we also draw the caloric curves at constant pressure .",

    "the dependence of the caloric curves on the theoretical ambiguities is also discussed .",
    "section [ summary ] is devoted to a summary and future perspectives .",
    "in the present study , we adopt the gogny force @xcite as the effective nuclear interaction .",
    "the gogny force is one of the most successful effective interactions to reproduce the ground state properties of nuclei in mean field theories .",
    "the gogny force satisfies the saturation property of the nuclear matter with the incompressibility @xmath10 mev when it is applied to infinite nuclear matter with the uniform hartree - fock approximation .",
    "the saturation property is essential for the discussion of the similarities and the differences between finite and infinite nuclear systems .",

    "finding a temperature plateau in the constant pressure caloric curves is an easy way to identify first order phase transition in infinite systems .    in the realistic nuclear systems , however , the number of nucleons is several hundred at most .",
    "we have to carefully treat these systems because the ideas for infinite systems sometimes can not be applied to such small systems . nevertheless , gross _",
    "_ @xcite have pointed out that the essence of phase transition is the anomalous concavity of the entropy @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the number of microstates , and the effect of phase transition can be clearly observed even in finite systems by finding backbending ( negative heat capacity ) in the microcanonical caloric curves .",
    "the microcanonical ensemble with energy @xmath5 , volume @xmath6 and particle number @xmath7 can be obtained by solving the time evolution of the many - nucleon system confined in a container and regarding the state at each time as a sample of the ensemble . for the time evolution calculation , we utilize amd , which is a microscopic dynamical model based on the degrees of freedom of interacting nucleons @xcite .",

    "the width parameter @xmath30 is treated as a constant parameter and taken as @xmath31 so as to reasonably describe the ground state of light nuclei such as @xmath32 .",
    "the spin - isospin states ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 ) are also independent of time . because of the antisymmetrization , an amd wave function @xmath37 contains many quantum features so that it is even utilized for the study of nuclear structures @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the centroids @xmath2 , which parameterize @xmath37 , is determined by a stochastic equation of motion @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the deterministic term derived from the time - dependent variational principle and @xmath40 is the stochastic term , which is important to describe the appearance of various reaction channels in multifragmentation , for example .",
    "the stochastic term @xmath40 is also essential for the consistency with the quantum statistics @xcite .",
    "two origins of the stochastic term @xmath40 are considered ; one is the two - nucleon collisions and the other is related to the unrestricted single - particle motion in the mean field and the localization of single - particle wave functions when fragments are formed @xcite .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we briefly explain these terms referring to refs .  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we introduce several new improvements which are necessary for the present application because the energy conservation and the motion of emitted nucleons should be treated very consistently .",
    "the deterministic term is derived from the time - dependent variational principle and given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 with @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "if a nucleon is located out of nuclei and there are almost no other nucleons around it , the wave function of such a nucleon is interpreted to have a sharp momentum distribution rather than the momentum distribution corresponding to the gaussian wave packet in eq .  .",
    "this change of interpretation has been necessary for the consistency of q - values of nucleon emission and fragmentation @xcite , and is very important for the definition of temperature in the present work . by this modification ,",
    "the zero - point kinetic energies of gaseous nucleons are subtracted from the total kinetic energy @xcite by @xmath48 where the zero - point kinetic energies of isolated fragments are also subtracted .",
    "the function @xmath49 stands for the number of isolated fragments and nucleons which are assumed to have the definite center - of - mass momenta without zero - point energies .",

    "the potential energy should be also modified following the same change of interpretation of gaseous nucleons , because the spatial distribution of each gaseous nucleon is wide correspondingly to the sharp momentum distribution .",
    "the details of the modification term @xmath47 are also given in appendix [ zeropoint ] .",
    "the parameters of the modification terms are chosen in such a way that a nucleon is treated as a gaseous nucleon ( with a sharp momentum width ) if the number of other nucleons around it is less than about 2 .",

    "equation ( [ eq : effectiveh ] ) defines the total energy that is to be conserved by the deterministic term @xmath39 .",
    "the same energy is conserved also by the stochastic term .",
