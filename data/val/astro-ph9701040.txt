    "rich clusters of galaxies have been used by many authors as tracers of the large - scale structure of the universe .",
    "most analyses to date have relied on the cluster catalogue of abell ( 1958 ) ( and later abell , corwin & olowin 1989 ( aco ) ) .",
    "angular clustering statistics for abell clusters were calculated by bogart & wagoner ( 1973 ) and hauser & peebles ( 1973 ) and more recently , various redshift surveys of abell clusters have been used to estimate the two point cluster correlation function @xmath1 ( eg .",
    "bahcall & soneira 1983 , klypin & kopylov 1983 , postman , huchra & geller 1992 , peacock & west 1992 ) .",
    "> from these studies , the two point correlation function for clusters has been found to be consistent in shape with the power law form measured for galaxies , @xmath8 with a similar value of the power - law index @xmath9 but with a higher amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "for example , peacock & west ( 1992 ) find @xmath10 ( where h@xmath11 ) for abell clusters of richness @xmath12 whereas @xmath2 is around @xmath13 for galaxies ( see eg .",
    "davis & peebles 1983 ) .",
    "many authors have found , however , that there is much evidence to suggest that the abell catalogue , selected by eye from unmatched photographic plates , is affected by inhomogeneities in cluster selection which result in articifial clustering ( sutherland 1988 ; sutherland & efstathiou 1991 ; dekel _ et  al .",
    "_ 1989 ; peacock & west 1992 ) .",
    "new results on the distribution of clusters have been obtained from an automatically selected catalogue based on the apm galaxy survey ( dalton _ et  al .",
    "_ 1992 , hereafter dems92 ) , and from smaller samples of clusters selected from the edinburgh  durham galaxy catalogue and from the rosat x - ray cluster survey ( nichol _ et  al .",
    "_ 1992 ; romer _ et  al .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath14 measured from these studies is generally lower than for the abell samples , so that @xmath15 .",
    "however , it has been argued that the clustering seen in the automated surveys is dominated by poor clusters , and that the results may be compatible with the higher values of @xmath2 measured for @xmath16 abell clusters , provided that there is a strong dependence of the correlation length on cluster richness .",
    "bahcall & west(1992 ) and bahcall & cen ( 1992 ) argue that the abell data are consistent with a linear relation between @xmath2 and mean intercluster separation @xmath17 ( @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mean space density ) so that @xmath20 the evidence for this scaling relation , especially at high values of @xmath17 comes exclusively from estimates of the correlation functions of rich abell clusters ( eg . peacock & west 1992 ) .",
    "the validity of equation ( 2 ) thus depends critically on the uniformity of the abell catalogue , particularly at richnesses @xmath16 .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to test the scaling relation ( 2 ) using an independent sample of rich clusters of galaxies selected from the apm galaxy survey .",
    "croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) have shown that the amplitude of the cluster correlation function is is predicted to vary only weakly with cluster space - density for a range of cold dark matter ( cdm ) models .",
    "the existing data for apm clusters ( dalton _ et  al . _",
    "1994a ) are in good agreement with these predictions , but as the clusters are of relatively low richness and hence low @xmath17 they are also consistent with the relationship given in equation 2 . in the study presented here",
    "we use a new extension of the apm cluster survey to test the behaviour of @xmath14 for richer clusters .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the cluster sample and its relationship to the samples of dalton _",
    "et  al._(1994a ) and dalton _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1994b ) in section 2 . in section 3 we present the correlation function for the new cluster sample and for various subsamples .",
    "we use a maximum likelihood estimator to fit a power law to the correlation function and investigate how the fitted parameters change with cluster richness . in section 4",
    "we compare our results with other data samples and with n - body simulations of cosmological models .",
    "we summarise our findings in section 5 .",
    "dems presented a summary of the algorithm used to select galaxy clusters from the apm survey . in dalton _ et  al . _",
    "( 1994a ) the selection procedure was changed slightly in order to increase the volume available to the survey . a detailed description of the selection procedure and a discussion of the effects of changing the various selection parameters is presented in dalton _ et  al . _",
    "( 1997 ) . here",
    "we use the framework discussed in that paper to briefly describe changes to the selection procedure which increase our sensitivity to rich clusters at the expense of incompleteness at low richnesses .",
    "the effective depths of the cluster samples selected from the apm survey are limited by the definition of the cluster richness , @xmath21 .",
    "this is defined to be the weighted number of galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath22 $ ] above the mean background count in the range @xmath23 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath24 is defined as the magnitude of the galaxy for which the weighted count above background exceeds @xmath25 for the catalogue of dems92 and dalton _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1994b ) .",
    "the depth of the cluster catalogue defined in this way is fixed by the magnitude limit of the survey ( b@xmath26=20.5 ) , so @xmath24 is constrained to be brighter than @xmath27 . in dalton _ et  al . _",
    "( 1994a ) we created a catalogue of greater depth by changing the background slice to @xmath28 $ ] , and redefining @xmath29 to be @xmath30 . by combining this new catalogue with that of dems92 using a richness transformation calibrated from clusters that appear in both catalogues we created an extended sample of 364 clusters with apm richness @xmath31 ( sample b of dalton _",
    "et  al . _",
    "we will use results from this comparatively low richness sample in comparisons with measurements of clustering made from our new rich sample .",
    "the new rich sample was created by further extending our survey by increasing the limiting magnitude of the galaxy catalogue to @xmath32 .",
    "the apm photometry is complete to this limit but the fraction of objects which are mis - classified as stars rises sharply .",
    "however the distribution of stellar objects fainter than b@xmath26=20.5 is smooth on the scale of the counting annulus we use to determine the backround correction , and so does not affect our ability to select clusters .",
    "we changed our cluster selection parameters to @xmath33 and a richness counting slice ( count and background ) of @xmath34 $ ] to optimise the depth increase gained by using the extra @xmath35 of galaxy data .",
    "we scaled the richness counts in this catalogue by matching to the sample a catalogue in the same way as for sample b ( see dalton _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1994a ) , and then targeted all previously unidentified clusters with @xmath36 . in two and a half clear nights at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat )",
    "we were able to obtain unambiguous redshifts for @xmath37 new clusters .",
    "the redshifts were obtained using the cross - correlation technique of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) .",
    "the procedure is described in detail in dalton _ et  al . _",
    "( 1994b ) .    to choose which clusters to observe ,",
    "the catalogue was split into different richness subsets and these were each split further into 4 bands by ra .",
    "we were able to complete observations of the clusters in all subsets except for the poor clusters with @xmath38 hrs .",
    "as the efficiency of detection in our new catalogue is lowest for the poorest clusters ( @xmath39 , due to the change in selection parameters ) , most of the poor clusters in sample c are those from the previous catalogue . because of this , we limit our final statistical sample to nearby clusters in order to have an essentially complete sample .",
    "we choose to limit the sample to those clusters with a redshift @xmath40 . above this redshift",
    "the overall efficiency of cluster detection appears to fall rapidly as we will show below .",
    "combining the cluster data with sample b gives a sample of @xmath41 clusters with @xmath36 which we shall refer to as sample c. the redshift distribution of sample c is shown in panel ( a ) of fig . 1 , together with smoothed distribution obtained by convolving the histogram with a gaussian of width @xmath42 . the selection function also shown ( normalised to unity at the peak ) suggests that incompleteness in the deep sample starts to become important at high redshift ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the peak in the @xmath44 distribution at @xmath45 corresponds to a visible feature in the apm galaxy map at @xmath46 , and appears to be present in the aco catalogue in the form of a large number of distance class 6 clusters without published redshifts .",
    "there is also a lack of clusters in sample c at low redshifts ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this is mainly a consequence of clusters appearing too large on the plane of the sky for selection using percolation dalton _",
    "et  al . _",
    "there also do not appear to be any nearby very rich clusters in other surveys which overlap with the apm such as the ssrs galaxy redshift survey ( da costa _",
    "et  al . _",
    "this is a very small fraction of the volume of the rich cluster survey and in any case , we choose to limit the rest of our analysis to the clusters with @xmath48 .",
    "the redshift distribution for sample b is also shown , for comparison , in panel ( b ) of fig 1 .",
    "the smoothing of the distribution in this case was carried out using @xmath49 gaussian because of the higher space density of objects .",
    ".[tbdens ] the space density of clusters [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see from the contour plots that there is a slight anticorrelation of @xmath2 and @xmath50 , so that lower values of @xmath2 would result in a steeper slope for @xmath1",
    ". as the errors are large , the value of @xmath51 obtained for sample b with 364 clusters is broadly compatible with @xmath50 for the rich sample , c. the slope of @xmath1 seems to be steeper than that normally quoted for the correlation function of galaxies ( @xmath52 see eg .",

    "a plot of @xmath2 versus @xmath17 for various observational samples of clusters including the apm samples ( taken from table 2 above and dems92 and labelled apm and apm92 respectively ) .",
    "is shown in fig 4 .",
    "for the maximum likelihood points , the errors are @xmath53 for marginalisation of @xmath2 over all values of @xmath50 .",
    "the apm92 points are for @xmath50 constrained to be 2.0 .",
    "the points labelled ` abell ' indicate the results for abell @xmath54 , abell @xmath55 and abell @xmath56 clusters derived by peacock & west ( 1992 ) .",
    "the point labelled edcc is the result for 79 clusters from the edinburgh - durham cluster catalogue of lumsden _ et  al . _",
    "( 1992 ) estimated by nichol _",
    "et  al . _",
    "the error bar size was estimated using bootstrap resamplings .",
    "the same is true of the error on the point labelled x - abell , which was estimated by nichol , briel & henry ( 1994 ) , from 67 clusters in the redshift sample of huchra _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1990 ) which also have x - ray luminosities @xmath57 erg s@xmath58 .",
    "the point labelled rosat shows @xmath2 for @xmath1 measured from a redshift survey of an x - ray flux limited sample of clusters ( romer _ et  al .",
    "the x - ray flux for both these last samples was measured using the rosat satellite .",
    "it can be seen that most of the data points are for cluster samples with @xmath17 in the range @xmath59 , and that in this range , the results for the x - ray samples and automated galaxy surveys are in agreement with one another , and lower than those for abell clusters . as has been detailed previously , this can be understood as being due to non - uniformities in the abell catalogue which artificially boosts the amplitude of clustering . over this small range in cluster space density ,",
    "for which the errors are comparatively small , there is not much evidence for any trend of @xmath2 with @xmath17 and hence cluster richness .",
    "part of the reason for the work in this paper was to find out whether this is also true at higher richnesses and lower space densities .",
    "the solid line in the plot corresponds to the scaling relation @xmath60 proposed by bahcall & west ( 1992 ) as a fit to the correlation functions of the abell sample .",
    "as can be seen from the plot , the motivation for assuming this fit at high values of @xmath17 was provided by the results for abell @xmath61 clusters ( a sample of 42 clusters was used to calculate this data point  see peacock & west 1992 ) .    now that we have a sample of very rich clusters taken from a catalogue which is demonstrably free of artificial inhomogeneities , we are in the position to test equation ( 2 ) using the apm data alone .",
    "the three apm points on the right of the plot are for @xmath62 and @xmath63 clusters , which have space densities comparable to that of the abell @xmath61 clusters .",
    "if the error bars are taken at face value , then the relation would appear to be ruled out at the @xmath64 level .",
    "however , as we have seen from table 1 , the error bars could be underestimates by a factor of @xmath65 . also , the space densities of clusters used to derive @xmath17 values are not precise estimates because of the difficulties involved in estimating the completeness of richness limited cluster catalogues ( see efstathiou _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1992 ) . that said , we believe that these data points are more reliable than those for the abell @xmath61 clusters .",
    "table 2.1 also shows us that the error bars for the richest sub - samples are likely to be the most accurate . in summary , the apm points are consistent with a weak dependence of clustering on richness .",
    "we find no evidence that equation ( 2 ) applies to rich clusters of galaxies , with important implications for theories of structure formation as described in the next section .",
    "croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) examined the behaviour of @xmath2 with @xmath17 expected in several popular cosmological scenarios ( see also bahcall & cen 1992 , mann , heavens & peacock 1993 ) . the box size ( @xmath66 ) of the dissipationless",
    "n - body simulations used in that study , meant that the predictions did not extend to the large values of @xmath17 needed to make comparisons with our new rich cluster sample .",
    "we have therefore run a set of simulations ( using the same particle - particle particle - mesh n - body code ) with box size @xmath67 and @xmath68 particles .",
    "these simulations are the same as those used in croft & efstathiou ( 1995 ) .",
    "the models we shall consider are the standard cdm model ( scdm has @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) and the spatially flat low density cdm model ( lcdm has @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) . both models are normalised to be compatible with the first year cobe anisotropies ( wright _ et  al . _ 1994 ) so that @xmath74 for both models , where @xmath75 is the rms amplitude of linear fluctuations in @xmath76 spheres .",
    "the results are insenstive to the precise value of @xmath75 .",
    "we use the same techniques as in croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) and dalton _",
    "et  al . _",
    "( 1994a ) to find clusters in the simulations .",
    "this involves finding cluster centres in real space with a percolation algorithm and then ordering clusters by the mass contained within a certain radius , in this case @xmath77 .",
    "we then calculate @xmath2 for clusters with different lower mass limits , with the results shown in figure 5 .",
    "we have chosen to calculate the correlation functions in redshift space , for more accurate comparison with the observations .",
    "the values of @xmath2 which we present below are @xmath78 larger than the values estimated in real space .",
    "the correlation functions for the lcdm model are shown in figure 5 , together with the apm points ( estimated using equation 4 ) .",
    "the space densities of the simulated clusters were selected to be close to those for the three subsamples of rich apm clusters plotted .",
    "the curves plotted are the averages of results for 10 simulations of lcdm .",
    "we can see that the apm results are compatible with lcdm model .",
    "we can also see that the clustering strength of lcdm clusters increases only a small amount as the richness bound is increased .    in order to see how the clustering results are affected by the mask and selection function",
    ", we have plotted the results for the mock apm cluster catalogues constructed from 10 lcdm simulations and described in section 3.1 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 6 in the form of a scatter plot . in each panel",
    "we plot @xmath2 against @xmath50 ( both measured from the maximum likelihood technique ) .",
    "we show results calculated from clusters with the same @xmath17 values as those in figure 5 .",
    "we also plot points for the apm results for equivalent richess clusters . in each of the panels we can see that the apm results are not extreme outliers and it looks plausible that they could have been drawn from the same distribution as the lcdm points . a line denoting the relationship of equation 2",
    "is drawn on each panel . from this",
    "we can conclude that in an lcdm universe we would have a @xmath79 chance for each richness cut of measuring a value of @xmath2 which fits this relationship .    in figure 7",
    "we plot @xmath2 measured from the correlation functions of the lcdm and scdm clusters against @xmath17 .",
    "the error bars on the simulation points were calculated from the @xmath80 error on the mean taken from 3 simulations of each model .",
    "we therefore have 2.4 times as many clusters of any given space density as in the ensembles of croft & efstathiou ( 1994 ) .",
    "we also plot the values of @xmath2 calculated using the maximum likelihood method in this paper .",
    "the plots shows the very weak trend of clustering strength with cluster richness continuing for both models at least up to @xmath81 .",
    "the apm points are consistent with the lcdm model , but not with scdm .",
    "we note here that a simulation with a different amplitude of clustering in the underlying mass could have an @xmath2 which differs by as much as @xmath82 as could clusters which are selected using a different method .",
    "these variations are not expected to be large enough to affect our conclusions ( croft & efstathiou 1994 , eke _ et  al .",
    "_ 1996 , mo , jing & white 1996 ) .",
    "it is encouraging that models with @xmath83 , which were introduced to explain clustering in the galaxy distribution ( see eg .",
    "efstathiou , sutherland & maddox 1990 ) are also able to match well the clustering of rare and extreme objects such as the rich galaxy clusters considered here .",
    "we also expect other gaussian models with similar power spectra such as a mixed dark matter ( mdm ) universe dominated by cdm and with an additional component of massive neutrinos ( see eg .",
    "_ 1993 ) to be compatible with our apm results at high richnesses , as they are at low richnesses ( dalton _ et  al . _",
    "> from figure 7 we can also see that whilst models such as low density cdm provide a good fit to the clustering behaviour of rich apm clusters they are completely incompatible with the scaling relation derived from considering rich abell clusters .",
    "our data exclude such a strong scaling relation and remove the need to resort to non - gaussian models for the formation of large - scale structure .",
    "we have carried out a new extension of the apm cluster redshift survey to provide a sample of 165 clusters with richnesses @xmath84 and mean space density of @xmath85 .",
    "the correlation function of this sample is found to be consistent with the clustering amplitude measured for our previous larger sample of poorer apm clusters . restricting the evaluation of @xmath1 to even richer",
    "subsamples shows that there is only a weak dependence of correlation length with cluster richness .",
    "this is disagrees with results from abell @xmath86 clusters .",
    "the high amplitude of @xmath14 for the abell @xmath87 sample is most probably caused by inhomgeneities in the abell catalogue .",
    "the weak dependence of clustering strength with richness that we find in the apm survey is however in good agreement with what is expected in a universe with gaussian initial fluctuations and a power spectrum with more large - scale power than standard cdm , such as low density cdm or mdm .",
