    "the sensitivities of second generation gravitational wave detectors such as advanced ligo and advanced virgo are expected to be limited by the thermal noise of the test masses within a significant range of signal frequencies around 100 hz  @xcite . to reach even better sensitivities ,",
    "it has been proposed to use laser beams with an intensity pattern other than that of the fundamental gaussian beam to reduce the effects of this thermal noise  @xcite .",
    "a beam whose intensity is distributed more homogeneously over the mirror surface , for the same clipping losses , benefits from a more effective averaging over the mirror surface distortions caused by thermal effects  @xcite .",
    "the specific advantage of using higher order lg modes , as opposed to mesa  @xcite and conical  @xcite beams , is that they are compatible with spherical mirrors as currently used in gw detectors and other high precision optical setups .",
    "research into the potential of the lg@xmath0 mode in gravitational wave detectors has been carried out using numerical simulations and table - top experiments  @xcite .",
    "the sensing and control signals for an lg@xmath0 beam were found to perform as well as for the fundamental mode in all aspects examined and the lg@xmath0 behaved as expected in short linear and triangular optical cavities .",
    "however , an optical cavity resonant for a higher  order gaussian mode is degenerate so that a number of modes can resonate at the same time .",
    "this is a fundamental difference to a well designed cavity for the fundamental gaussian mode , in which any resonant enhancement of other modes can be suppressed .",
    "this degeneracy can potentially cause additional optical losses .",
    "simulations have shown that the use of the lg@xmath0 beam , compared to the fundamental mode , lg@xmath1 , could result in a significant contrast defect at the dark fringe  @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to investigate how mirror surface distortions affect the purity of an lg@xmath0 beam in high finesse cavities , by analytical calculation and numerical simulation .",
    "we will focus on the direct coupling from a distorted mirror and how this affects the mode content in a linear cavity , with our final aim to produce specifications for the mirror surfaces .",
    "ideally the mirrors in gravitational wave detectors should be perfectly smooth with a radius of curvature matching that of the incident beam . however , real mirrors deviate from a perfect surface , altering the beams which interact with them",

    "the surface @xmath3 is defined as a height field across a plane perpendicular to the optical axis along @xmath6 . ]    in order to investigate the effects of surface distortions measured mirror surface maps can be used .",
    "the term _ mirror map _ refers to an array of data detailing the optical properties of a mirror , often its surface height in nanometers .",
    "this data can be used to represent realistic mirrors in numerical simulations of gravitational wave detectors .",
    "mirror maps have been produced from uncoated advanced ligo mirror substrates which represent the best mirror surfaces of this kind currently available . in the following",
    "we have made use of one such map , the surface map of the substrate etm08  @xcite . the deviation of this map surface from a perfectly spherical surface with radius of curvature 2249.28 m is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etm08 ] .",
    "this substrate shows an rms surface figure error of 0.523 nm .",
    "zernike polynomials are well suited for the purposes of describing mirror surface distortions .",
    "zernike polynomials can be used to describe classical distortions such as tilts and curvatures  @xcite .",
    "they are a complete set of functions which are orthogonal over the unit disc and defined by radial index , @xmath7 , and azimuthal index , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 . for any index @xmath8",
    "we have one odd and one even polynomial  @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the normalised radial coordinate , @xmath12 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath13 is the amplitude and @xmath14 is the radial function .",
    "the radial function is given by the following sum : @xmath15 for @xmath16 even and 0 otherwise .",
    "this gives @xmath17 non - zero zernike polynomials for each value of @xmath7 ( for @xmath18 the odd polynomial is zero ) .",
    "[ fig : zern ] shows the surfaces described by the zernike polynomials corresponding to orders ( n ) 0 to 4 .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     these amplitude limits were applied to the etm08 mirror map , resulting in coupling of 19ppm into modes other than lg@xmath0 and 0.043ppm into the other order 9 modes .",
    "the cavity defined in sec .  [ sec : ligo_cavs ] was simulated with this limited map , resulting in 815ppm impurity in the circulating beam .",
    "this is a very good improvement on the original impurity of 0.114 , illustrating that a high beam purity is achievable with these mirror requirements . to achieve an even higher beam purity",
    "will involve reducing the amplitudes of these polynomials further , as well as additional zernike requirements .",
    "we have investigated the coupling which occurs when laguerre - gauss modes are incident on a mirror with surface distortions .",
    "taking an analytical approach we used zernike polynomials to represent mirror surface distortions and derived an approximate equation for the significant coupling when an lg mode is reflected from a surface defined by a particular zernike polynomial .",
    "this derivation resulted in a condition for significant coupling , @xmath19 , where @xmath8 is the azimuthal index of the zernike polynomial and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the azimuthal indices of the incident and coupled modes respectively .",
    "this is a significant result as it allows us to predict which order 9 modes will be largely coupled by particular zernike polynomials and suggest which modes will have large amplitudes in the arm cavities    we investigated the performance of lg@xmath0 in high finesse cavities by simulation with advanced ligo mirror maps .",
    "this illustrated the degraded purity of the circulating beam in realistic cavities due to higher order mode degeneracy .",
    "the results were then analysed by looking at the zernike polynomials representing our example mirror map .",
    "the analysis and results were consistent with the predictions made from eq .",
    "[ eq : k_eq ] .",
    "this suggested that astigmatism was causing a significant amount of coupling , particularly into the lg@xmath22 and lg@xmath23 modes .",
    "this was confirmed when the cavity was simulated again with the astigmatism removed from the mirror map and we observed a dramatic increase in the lg@xmath0 mode purity .",
    "the analytical description enabled us to identify the specific zernike polynomials which cause large couplings as well as the lg modes which would dominate as a result . using this",
    "we were able to derive certain requirements for our example mirror map , etm08 , in terms of limits on the amplitudes of the zernike polynomials z@xmath24 , z@xmath25 and z@xmath26 ( table  [ table : limits ] ) . using this map",
    "the resulting circulating beam impurity was found to be 815ppm , a significant reduction from the original impurity of 0.114 .",
    "this investigation has demonstrated that a high beam purity is achievable using an lg@xmath0 beam when modifications are made to the low order zernike polynomials in advanced ligo mirrors . implementing the lg@xmath0 beam in gravitational wave detectors",
    "will be challenging as we require very small amplitudes on these lower order polynomials .",
    "we should also consider that the example mirror surfaces considered here refer to uncoated substrates .",
    "the coating process is likely to add to the lower order features in the mirror surfaces .",
    "however , using this analytical approach we can derive specific requirements for the mirror surfaces leading to designs for suitable mirrors for these higher order beams .",
    "we would like to thank garilynn billingsley for providing the advanced ligo mirror surface maps and for advice and support on using them .",
    "we would also like to thank david shoemaker and stefan hild for useful discussions .",
    "this work has been supported by the science and technology facilities council and the european commission ( fp7 grant agreement 211743 ) .",

    "the product of two laguerre - gauss modes is : @xmath27 the following derivation follows from eq .",
    "[ eq : m_condition ] .",
    "currently we are concerned with the magnitude of the coupling coefficients , so we ignore any constant phase shifts and integrate with respect to @xmath12 : @xmath28 in order to further simplify the equation the following variable substitution is made : @xmath29 and a new limit to the integral : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the zernike radius .",
    "this gives the integral : @xmath32 substituting in the sums representing the laguerre polynomials and the radial zernike function as a function of @xmath33 gives : @xmath34 this type of integral results in the lower incomplete gamma function : @xmath35 when @xmath36 is equal to @xmath7 , an integer , the function is given by the following sum : @xmath37 therefore , the final equation for this approximation of the magnitude of the coupling coefficients is given by : @xmath38",
    "clipping loss is given by : @xmath39 where the integral represents the normalised power reflected by a perfect mirror .",
    "@xmath40 defines an infinite plane perpendicular to the beam axis .",
    "the magnitude squared of an lg mode is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the beam radius , @xmath43 and @xmath20 are the mode indices and @xmath4 is the radial position . integrating over the surface and taking a similar approach as for the coupling coefficients",
    "we get : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath31 is the radius of the mirror and @xmath46 is the lower incomplete gamma function .",
    "for certain zernike polynomials ( those with non - zero @xmath8 ) their amplitudes in a surface depend on the orientation of that surface with respect to the zernike surface .",
    "for example , consider the two polynomials responsible for astigmatism , z@xmath47 .",
    "the two polynomials actually describe the same shape , with one just rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other . therefore , rotating a surface , such as the one described by mirror map etm08 , will change the amplitudes of these two polynomials within the surface . fig .",
    "[ fig : etm08_zs_rotated ] illustrates this effect .",
    "the plots show the amplitudes of the order 2 zernike polynomials present in the etm08 mirror surface as it is rotated .",
    "as expected the amplitude of the z@xmath48 polynomial remains constant as it has no angular dependence .",
    "the amplitudes of the z@xmath47 polynomials oscillate and , at a certain rotation ( around 120@xmath49 ) the astigmatism of the surface is completely described by z@xmath50 , and 90@xmath49 later completely described by z@xmath51 .",
    "the root mean squared amplitude ( @xmath52 ) of the polynomials remains constant .",
    "we have used zernike polynomials to describe mirror surface distortions and analyse the coupling that occurs from lg@xmath0 into other order 9 modes .",
    "this approach appears to be very suitable as we have been able to identify specific polynomials which extract significant amounts of power from the input mode .",
    "however , there is an alternative method used to investigate mirror surface distortions , which involves looking at the spatial frequencies present in real mirrors . in this section",
    "we compare these two methods .",
    "to look at the spatial frequencies present in realistic mirrors we perform a 2d fourier transform of the surface height data .",
    "the resulting spectra is then analysed and synthetic maps are created with the same spatial frequencies .",
    "this method focuses on identifying particular spatial wavelengths which cause a large degree of coupling from lg@xmath0 .",
    "many synthetic maps are created and used in simulations of gravitational wave detectors . a statistical approach",
    "is then taken to determine the extent of the coupling when specific spatial frequencies are present in the mirror .    in the zernike approach",
    "we look at the different polynomials present in mirror surface distortions .",
    "this can be thought of as equivalent to looking at the spectra of the mirror surfaces as the different polynomials represent different spatial frequencies .",
    "the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : map_spectra ] illustrates this .",
    "the spectrum of the etm08 advanced ligo mirror map is shown , along with the spectra of maps made up from the zernike polynomials present in the etm08 mirror .",
    "each of the zernike maps recreates the ligo map with polynomials up to a certain order .",
    "the plots show that as the order of zernike polynomials present increases the higher spatial frequencies are represented in the mirror map .",
    "this is because these higher order polynomials represent the higher order spatial frequencies .",
    "looking at the spatial frequencies present in the zernike polynomials we found that the frequencies depended on the order , @xmath7 .",
    "a consequence of this is that if we just consider the spatial frequencies present in the mirror maps we will not be able to distinguish between polynomials with different @xmath8 . as we have seen , the azimuthal index is very significant as it determines which modes are largely coupled from lg@xmath0 . therefore looking at the spatial frequencies does nt identify the important shapes in the mirror surfaces .",
    "the zernike approach would seem to be the most suitable as this allows us to identify the interesting polynomials and modes .                                `",
