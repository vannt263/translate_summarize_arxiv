    "unfortunately , we have no information about the orbital period of 2qz 0219 .",
    "instead , we settle for using the obtained superhump period as @xmath22 .",
    "this prescription is fairly valid because there is enough evidence that the difference between the superhump period and orbital period is only a few percent .",
    "in addition , the absence of an eclipse during the whole superoutburst indicate that 2qz 0219 is not a high inclination system .",
    "hence , we can safely use the above equation in order to estimate a distance to the object . with a little algebra ,",
    "a plausible distance to 2qz 0219 lies in 370(+20 , -60 ) pc .",
    "this distance should be checked by other methods in future .",
    "high speed ccd photometry has revealed that su uma - type dwarf novae show changes of the superhump period during the superoutburst .",
    "most su uma - type dwarf novae show a decrease in their superhump periods as the superoutburst proceeds , presumably due to the shrinkage of the disk radius , or to a natural consequence of mass depletion from the disk @xcite .",
    "recently , it has turned out that several su uma - type dwarf novae including wz sge - type stars increase the superhump period with time .",
    "figure 7 represents period @xmath10 @xmath20 diagram for su uma - type stars . as for the cause of increasing superhump period",
    ", @xcite has given an insightful suggestion that the radius of the accretion disk at the outburst maximum is related to an increase or decrease of the superhump period .",
    "if the accretion disk is spread out well beyond the 3:1 resonance radius , where an eccentric mode sets in , the eccentric mode can propagate beyond the 3:1 resonance radius because there exists plenty mass in the outer region of the accretion disk during the superoutburst .",
    "if the argument by @xcite is correct , we can naturally explain why the increasing period of superhumps is @xmath33 seen among wz sge - type stars and su uma stars with large amplitudes .",
    "in the case of 2qz 0219 , taking into account the results of negative @xmath20 derivative and the above mentioned suggestion by @xcite , the radius of the accretion disk was not so large at the superoutburst maximum , at most , as much as the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "thus , the superhump period variation for 2qz 0219 behaves as the `` textbook '' su uma - type dwarf novae . in order to test the validity of uemura s implication ,",
    "hydrodynamic simulation should be performed .",
    "the present photometric observations of 2qz 0219 allowed us to confirm a new member of su uma - type dwarf novae by detecting superhumps .",
    "the best estimated superhumps period of j0219 was 0.081113(19 ) days = 116.8 min , placing 2qz 0219 near the lower edge of the period gap . in conjunction with our observations and the asas-3 archival data , the plateau stage of the superoutburst lasted at most 20 days .",
    "the amplitude of the superoutburst exceeded 5 mag , slightly larger than ordinary su uma - type dwarf novae but within the normal range .",
    "an estimation of the recurrence time of the superoutburst yielded @xmath1 346 @xmath10 462 days .",
    "we can roughly determine the distance to 2qz 0219 to be 370(+20 , -60 ) pc .",
    "the resultant @xmath25 diagram , together with the above results , led us to the conclusion that 2qz 0219 is a new member of a prototypical su uma - type dwarf nova .",
