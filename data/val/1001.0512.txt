    "aovel ( = hd68826 ) was classified as bpsi by @xcite and was reported as an eclipsing binary by @xcite .",
    "in fact it is one of the only two double - lined eclipsing binaries with a bpsi component known to date @xcite . from light - time effect on the times of minima",
    ", @xcite deduced the presence of a third body .    in our previous paper @xcite , using feros spectroscopic observations , we discovered that this system is actually a spectroscopic quadruple system with components close to the zams .",
    "the four stars form two close spectroscopic pairs ( periods of 1.58 and 4.15 days ) bound gravitationally to each other in a wide eccentric orbit with a period of 41 yr . in that paper",
    "we combined our radial velocity ( * rv * ) measurements with the available photometric data to derive orbital parameters for both binary systems and to calculate the absolute parameters of the eclipsing system .",
    "for the first time , direct determination of the radius and the mass was obtained for a bpsi star .    in this work",
    "we present high - resolution , high signal - to - noise uves spectra , which were used to perform an abundance analysis of all four components of this multiple system .",
    "in sec.2 we present the observations and describe the reconstruction of the component spectra . in sec.3 we analyze the spectral characteristics of each component and present the results of the abundance analysis . in the last section we discuss the main results and the occurrence of chemical peculiarities in binary and multiple systems .",
    "three spectra were obtained in service mode with uves at vlt - ut2 telescope in october 2005 .",
    "the spectra have been taken with the 0.4arcsec slit for the blue arm and the 0.3arcsec slit for the red arm on three consecutive nights with two different dichroics to achieve the highest uves resolution of 110,000 in the red spectral region and 80,000 in the blue spectral region .",
    "we used exposure times of 2030 min , obtaining a s / n ratio above 200 in the spectral range 40008000 .",

    "[ fig.rv ]        once the spectra of the stellar components have been reconstructed , they must be scaled to recover the intrinsic intensities of the spectral lines in those stars . to this aim , as in our previous paper",
    ", we used the photometric relative fluxes given by @xcite .",
    "the relative contribution to the observed continuum near @xmath2 was estimated to be 0.40 , 0.28 , 0.16 , 0.16 for components a , b , c , and d. generally , when applying a spectral disentangling technique , the resulting spectra of the individual components have a very high quality , since the s / n - ratio increases roughly as the square root of the number of observed spectra involved in the calculations ( usually several tens ) , and diminishes proportionally to the relative flux of the component under consideration ( usually close to 0.5 ) . in the present work a small number of spectra are available for a system of 4 spectral components . for that reason , the reconstructed spectra ,",
    "after their continuum has been normalized to one , have a s / n - ratio lower than the composite observed spectra . in particular , for the less luminous stars c and d the effective s / n resulted between 50 and 80 .",
    "the primary component of this subsystem is a typical variable bpsi star with weak he lines .",
    "the spectrum of the component b appears rather normal with strong he and si lines .",
    "however , a careful inspection of the high - s / n uves spectra revealed the presence of some asymmetrical and variable line profiles in the spectrum of both stars a and b , which could be related to the presence of he , si , and mg spots . since a basic assumption for the reconstruction of the component spectra is the constancy with phase of the spectral morphology of each star , the disentangled spectra may have small artificial features around spectral lines presenting variability .",
    "for that reason we preferred , for the analysis of profile variability , to use only those spectral lines and orbital phases for which the line under consideration is clearly free of contamination from any other line belonging to the remaining components .",
    "the first two uves spectra are particularly useful for this purpose since in them both binary systems are near opposite quadratures , allowing us to identify clearly the four spectral components .",
    "in fig.2 we show the profile of several siii , mgii , and hei lines , the atomic species that present the most conspicuous lines in the spectra of stars a and b. both stars a and b exhibit line profile variability .",
    "figure3 shows the spectral region around the mgii doublet at @xmath34481 and the hei line @xmath34471 .",
    "the upper spectra are the two uves spectra taken at quadratures . in the lower spectra , synthetic spectra of c and d",
    "have been subtracted from the former .",
    "the mgii line at @xmath34481 shows the same behavior as silicon lines . in this figure",
    "we have plotted the observed spectra to demonstrate that the four components are well resolved , especially star b. consequently , the removal of components c and d does not affect significantly the shape of the line profiles . as a matter of fact , the profile difference between the two phases is evident even in the original composite spectra . in the case of star a , the lines are blended with those of component c in one of the two uves spectra , making somewhat less confident the analysis of profile variations .",
    "we note that , even though the reflexion effect due to the mutual irradiation of the components would distort the line profiles qualitatively in the same way as it is observed for mgii or siii lines , its expected contribution to the line profile variability is much smaller than the observed variations .",
    "in fact , from the temperature - ratio and the relative separation of the components , we estimate that the profile variations caused by reflexion effect would be about 5 times smaller than the variations observed in mgii @xmath34481 .",
    "therefore , the cause of these profile variations is not related to proximity effects but to asymmetries in the surface chemical distribution .",
    "[ fig.prof ]    [ fig.prof1 ] 4481 for the four components . in the two lower spectra c and d components have been removed .",
    "the lines mgii @xmath34481 and hei @xmath34471 are marked for components a and b.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    helium lines are weak , especially in star a , so it is not possible to detect clear variations in the line profiles from the available spectroscopic data .",
    "however , we detect that the strength of he lines at @xmath34026 and @xmath34471 is variable .",
    "other strong hei lines ( @xmath44121 , 4922 , 5016 , 5876 ) appear blended with fe or si lines belonging to the companions , making them less useful for the analysis of the line profile variability .    for star b",
    "the spectral line profiles of mgii and siii appear strongly variable , as presented in figs.2 and 3 . usually , magnesium does not present large equivalent width variations in magnetic peculiar stars @xcite .",
    "however , line profile variability of the magnesium doublet at @xmath34481 has been reported by @xcite , who published the first mg map for an ap star ( cuvir ) .",
    "they found that , even without showing important equivalent width variations , mgii @xmath34481 exhibits notorious profile variations , similar to those observed in aovel for the components a and b. the profile shape suggests that mg is more abundant in the region facing the companion star .",
    "a more complete study of line profiles , that would allow to determine the surface distribution of chemical elements , will require a larger number of spectra obtained at different phases .",
    "we can assume that the stellar rotation in the short - period eccentric binary ab is synchronized with the angular velocity at periastron , so that the rotational period differs from the orbital period by a factor 1.163 ( @xmath5 d , @xmath6 d ) .",
    "this fact implies that the stellar surface visible at a given orbital phase varies with time , completing one cycle in 9.7 days , which corresponds to about 6 orbital cycles .",
    "a multi - epoch study of aovel would be of great interest to prove whether the location of stellar spots is fixed on the star surface or is related to the position of the stellar companion .    in our spectra of the c and d components",
    "the most interesting , and rather unexpected fact is the presence of spectral lines typical of hgmn stars . the hgii line @xmath33984 is present in both stars c and d ,",
    "while strong yii and ptii lines are present in the spectrum of component d. although comparatively weak , some mnii lines have been also identified in both components . in the reconstructed spectrum of star d we identified ptii lines at 4046 and 4514 and more than two dozens yii lines .",
    "no noticeable lines of zrii , scii , baii , pii , xeii , gaii were detected in stars c or d. the measured central wavelength of hgii line at 3984 , 3983.975 and 3984.08 for stars c and d , respectively , indicates that heavy hg isotopes are predominant in these components .",
    "we will return to this point in the next section .",
    "the weakness of spectral lines for the two less massive stars makes impossible to study line profile variations in their spectra .",
    "the abundances were determined with the synthetic spectrum method using atlas9 model atmospheres and the synthe code @xcite .",
    "stellar temperatures of companions c and d were estimated from the correlation of excitation potentials of fe lines with abundances @xcite .",
    "microturbulent velocities were derived from the correlation of equivalent widths of fe lines with abundances .    in case of stars a and b , however , it was not possible to apply the same procedure since fe lines are weaker and they appear broader because of the higher rotation .",
    "estimated temperatures for these stars were derived from the observed masses and radii , interpolating in the grid of geneva theoretical stellar models @xcite for solar composition .",
    "fig.4 shows the position of stars a and b in the mass - ratio diagram .",
    "both stars are located close the zams .",
    "as is shown in this figure , the masses and radii determined from light and rv curves correspond to temperatures of 13900@xmath7500k and 13200@xmath7450k for components a and b , respectively . surface gravity were calculated directly from masses and radii .",

    "this explains why he lines are stronger in the star b , even when a is hotter than b according to the depths of photometric minima .",
    "star b appears similar to a normal late b - type star , having the abundances of helium and silicon close to solar values .",

    "no line of ti has been observed either in star a or b , indicating that ti is underabundant in both stars .",
    "mg is underabundant in star a by @xmath9 dex .",
    "similar values are frequently observed in magnetic ap and bp stars @xcite .",
    "we note that the presented abundances in stars a and b should be taken with caution , since the detected line profile variations suggest a non - uniform chemical distribution of at least a few elements .",
    "the subsystem cd shows abundances which are typical for hgmn stars .",
    "star c shows a strong overabundance of hg by 5.8dex .",
    "other metals like fe , ti , mg , and si show normal solar abundances in star c. abundances of c , o , ga , sc , and sr seem also to be solar .",
    "helium lines are only marginally detected in star c and the corresponding abundance is consequently rather uncertain ( about 0.4 dex ) .",
    "it is clear , however , that he is underabundant in star c.    star d exhibits overabundances of hg by 5.2dex , y by 2.5dex , pt by 5.2dex , and sr by 0.8dex , relative to the solar values .",
    "ga and sc lines are not observed .",
    "the uncertainties of the abundance determination , typically 0.10.2 , are somewhat larger than in usual analyses even though the observed spectra have high s / n - ratio and high resolution .",
    "three different reasons contribute to the degradation of the accuracy .",
    "first , the effective s / n - ratio of the normalized spectra of the individual components is comparatively low , since the line strength is diluted by the continua of the 4 components . in the case of stars",
    "c and d , for example , the s / n is diminished by a factor 6 .",
    "second , the disentangling process using a small number of observed spectra might generate small fake features , especially close to strong variable lines .",
    "finally , the uncertainty of the line equivalent widths involves the uncertainty in the relative light contribution of each component to the total light of the system , i.e. the normalization scale factors adopted from the photometric data .",
    "we note however that , the chemical peculiarities mentioned above are much larger than the uncertainties , and the classification of stars c and d as hgmn stars is absolutely out of doubt .",
    "[ fig.cd ]    in fig.5 we present the synthetic spectrum of star d in the spectral region containing ptii4046 , ptii4061 , srii4077 , and several fe and cr lines .",
    "as it is visible in this figure , ni is underabundant in this star .",
    "fig.6 shows the synthetic spectra for the regions of the hgii line at @xmath10 .",
    "even when the rotational broadening is significant , some information about the isotopic composition can be derived from the reconstructed spectra of components c and d. with this aim the line profile was fitted with a synthetic spectrum in which hg is assumed to be a mixture of the lightest ( 196 ) and the heaviest ( 204 ) isotopes . as it can be seen in the figure , the best fit suggests that the heaviest isotope is by far the most abundant in both components of the less massive subsystem .",
    "[ fig.hg ] 3984 and the yii line @xmath33982 . the isotopic composition for hg",
    "was assumed to be 196=0.9% , 204=99.1% for starc and 196=4% , 204=96% for star d. , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=38.0% ]",
    "using high - s / n high - resolution spectra obtained with uves , we have determined chemical abundance for all four components of the multiple system aovel .",
    "further , line profile variations were detected in the spectra of the two most massive stars belonging to the ab system .",
    "since the multiple system aovel is formed by four gravitationally bound stars , we can assume that they have the same original chemical composition and the same age .",
    "all components are close to the zams and have already developed different chemical anomalies in their atmospheres , depending on their temperature and probably due to the membership in binary systems .",
    "the observed masses and radii for the components of the eclipsing pair suggest that the system age is less than about 40 million years .",
    "the connection between hgmn peculiarity and membership in binary and multiple systems seems to be supported by two observational facts . on the one hand",
    "there is a high frequency of binaries and multiples among hgmn stars @xcite . on the other hand , in some binaries",
    "the location of chemical spots seems to be related with the position of the binary companion ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "these studies indicates that the presence of a companion can play a significant role in the development and distribution of chemical anomalies on the surface of hgmn stars , probably due to proximity effects on the atmospheric temperature or due to the magnetic field induced in a close binary system .",
    "the role that magnetic fields possibly play in the development of anomalies in hgmn stars , which mostly appear in binary systems , has never been critically tested by astrophysical dynamos .",
    "recent magnetohydrodynamical simulations revealed a distinct structure for the magnetic field topology similar to the fractured elemental rings observed on the surface of hgmn stars ( see e.g. fig .  1 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the combination of differential rotation and a poloidal magnetic field was studied numerically by the spherical mhd code of @xcite .",
    "the presented typical patterns of the velocity and the magnetic field on the surface of the star may as well be an indication for element redistribution on ( or in ) the star .",
    "generally he and si variable bp stars possess large - scale organized magnetic fields which in many cases appear to occur essentially under the form of a single large dipole located close to the centre of the star .",
    "the magnetic field is usually diagnosed through observations of circular polarization in spectral lines .",
    "@xcite used the multi - mode instrument fors1 mounted on the 8 m kueyen telescope of the vlt to measure the mean longitudinal magnetic field in the system ao vel .",
    "no detection was achieved with the single low - resolution measurement ( r=2000 ) resulting in @xmath11= 80@xmath764 g .",
    "we should , however , keep in mind that the observed spectropolarimetric spectrum is a composite spectrum consisting of four spectropolarimetric spectra belonging to a , b , c and d components .",
    "each of the companions can possess an individual magnetic field of different geometry , strength and polarity .",
    "since the inhomogeneous elemental distribution of si and mg is also observed on the surface of the component b , the presence of a large - scale organized magnetic field is quite possible in this component too .",
    "the components c and d show the peculiarity character typical of hgmn stars .",
    "@xcite showed that longitudinal magnetic fields in hgmn stars are rather weak , of the order of a few hundred gauss and less , and the structure of their fields must be sufficiently tangled so that it does not produce a strong net observable circular polarization signature .",
    "thus , the non - detection of a magnetic field in the system ao vel can be possibly explained by the dilution of the magnetic signal due to the superposition of four differently polarized spectra .",
    "on the other hand , the magnetic field of each component should be detectable with high resolution spectropolarimeters making use of the zeeman effect in individual metal lines .",
    "the time scale for the peculiarities to be developed remain unclear since the results of studies of evolutionary status of chemically peculiar stars of different type show somewhat contradictory results .",
    "the early work by @xcite suggested that the frequency of peculiar stars of si and hgmn groups increases with age and particularly there exist no peculiar star on the zams . in a more recent photometric search for peculiar stars in five young clusters",
    ", @xcite also concluded that the cp phenomenon needs at least several myr to start being effective . on the other hand",
    ", some chemically peculiar stars has been detected within very young associations or even in star forming regions like ori ob1 @xcite , lupus 3 @xcite , and l988 @xcite .",
    "the results of the present paper show the existence of coeval stars with chemical peculiarities of si and hgmn types , close to the zams indicating that the age threshold for these peculiarities is similar for both subgroups of chemically peculiar stars .",
    "our study supports the idea that these chemical peculiarities originate quite soon after the star formation .",
    "it is noteworthy , that the subsystem cd , the less massive binary of the aovel , shows several similarities with the eclipsing binary araur belonging to the aur ob1 association .",
    "both systems are formed by stellar components very close to the zams or even in the pre - ms stage @xcite , and they have almost the same orbital period , 4@xmath12.13 and 4@xmath12.15 for araur and aovelcd , respectively . in both systems the primary is a hgmn star , but while in the aovel cd system the secondary companion shares the same peculiarity , in araur the secondary is a normal star @xcite .",
    "in fact , the primary component of araur should be compared with star d of the system aovel , since they have a similar effective temperature .",
    "this similarity in the physical and orbital properties seems to have been translated into the development of similar pattern of chemical abundances : notorious overabundance of hg and pt , overabundance of sr , y , and mn at the level of 13 dex , slight overabundance of cr and ti , and the abundance of si and mg close to the solar abundance , or slightly subsolar .",
    "we selected a few additional hgmn spectroscopic binaries with effective temperatures close to 11,000k : hd32964 , hd89822 , hd173524 , and hd191110 . in fig.7",
    "the abundances of various elements in araur and selected binaries are compared with those of the aovel d companion .",
    "the abundances are presented for hgmn stars member of double - lined spectroscopic binaries with periods between 4 and 12 days and having effective temperatures in the range 1070011700k . for hd173524 and hd191110",
    "we plotted the abundances determined in both components .",
    "the abundances values have been taken from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable , how much similar the chemical composition of these stars is .",
    "we note , however , that the abundance distribution on the stellar surface of hgmn stars is probably inhomogeneous , and consequently , the chemical composition derived from spectroscopic observations that do not cover the rotational cycle , should be taken just as indicative values until accurate abundance values obtained using doppler imaging technique become available .",
    "the spotted character of magnetic bp - ap stars is well known , but also in the case of hgmn stars the presence of chemical spots or belts on the surface is not uncommon @xcite .",
    "[ fig.abun ]    as already mentioned above , the atmospheric chemical composition of araur exhibits a non - uniform surface distribution with a very interesting pattern related to the position of the companion @xcite .",
    "a similar study in aovel would be worthwhile to verify whether the elemental distribution on the stellar surfaces of c and d components show a similar behavior . furthermore , an intensive spectroscopic campaign that would allow the reconstruction of chemical maps for all four components should provide important information for the proper understanding of the origin of chemically peculiar stars .",
    "table[tab.lines ] lists all the spectral lines used for abundance determination .",
    "the lines marked with an asterisk are blends .",
