    "understanding the similarities between active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , which are powered by accretion onto super - massive black holes , and the much smaller galactic black hole x - ray binary systems ( bhxrb ) is currently one of the major research topics in high energy astrophysics .",
    "although some properties might be expected to scale simply with mass , the fact that the accretion disc is much cooler in agn may affect properties which depend on the spectrum of the nuclear ambient photon field , e.g. any x - ray emission produced by comptonisation .    over recent years",
    "considerable attention has been devoted to the comparison of the x - ray variability properties of agn and bhxrb and , in particular , to comparison of their x - ray power spectrum .",
    "it has been shown that most x - ray bright agn vary in a manner similar to that of the persistent bhxrb cyg  x-1 in the high / soft state ( where the medium energy x - ray spectrum is soft and the flux is high ) , rather than in the low / hard state ( where the medium energy x - ray spectrum is hard and the flux is low ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". in the soft state , the power density spectrum ( pds ) of cyg  x-1 has a power law shape of slope -1 at low frequencies ( i.e. @xmath3 with @xmath4 ) , bending to a steeper slope ( @xmath5 ) above a bend frequency @xmath6 , and the pds of most well observed agn are similar .",
    "we have shown @xcite that the time - scale associated with the bend , @xmath7 , scales as black hole mass divided by accretion rate ( in eddington units ) from agn down to bhxrb . as higher quality agn x - ray data has become available , primarily from , it is now possible to investigate other x - ray timing measurements which may , ultimately , prove to have greater diagnostic power than simple bend time - scales , i.e. x - ray time lags and coherence .",
    "time lags are normally observed between the fluctuations in different energy bands , where the hard x - ray bands tend to lag softer ones and the coherence is the degree to which the hard and soft bands are correlated .",
    "where the data are good enough , the lags and coherence can be measured as a function of fourier frequency .",
    "a particularly important aim , to which observations of lags and coherence can contribute , is to understand the origin of the x - ray variations in both bhxrb and agn . an interesting model for the origin of the fluctuations was proposed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "characteristic time - scales of variability , produced by variations in accretion rate , are associated with each radius in the accretion disc , with longer time - scales being associated with larger radii , and the variations propagate inward towards the x - ray emitting region .",
    "this model provides a natural explanation of the observed linear relationship between rms variability and flux in both bhxrb and agn @xcite .",
    "the propagating fluctuation model has been extended by @xcite and @xcite to include an extended x - ray emitting region where the x - ray spectrum hardens towards the black hole . as the fluctuations , which might have been produced further out , travel through this emitting region",
    ", they modulated first the emission with a softer spectrum and later the emission with harder spectra , thereby naturally giving rise to hard lags .",
    "the model has been used to simultaneously explain both the lags and the x - ray pds in the high accretion rate narrow line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) ark  564 @xcite but it has not yet been widely applied to other agn . in this paper",
    "we analyse a long  observation of the x - ray bright nls1  and show how the propagating fluctuation model can simultaneously explain the lags and the psd . using our new measurement of @xmath8 , we also investigate how well  agrees with the relationship between @xmath8 and the width of the @xmath9 emission line of @xcite .",

    "we assumed that 10% , 20% and 40% of the fluctuations in the 0.61 , 13 and 310 kev light curves is incoherent with the 0.20.6 kev fluctuations and added the uncertainty in this incoherent part of the power to the uncertainty in the power of the poisson noise .",

    "the shape of the pds ratio indicates that higher energy bands have both a higher bend frequency and a _ steeper _ high frequency slope .",
    "this behaviour could indicate the presence of a band - limited high frequency variability component with a hard energy spectrum , adding on to the soft band pds .",
    "this energy dependence , however , can also be produced by extended emitting regions filtering out the high frequency variability power .",
    "if higher energies are emitted by a more compact region , e.g. if the emitted spectrum hardens towards the centre , their pdss will have higher bend frequencies than softer bands , while the high frequency slope can be equal or steeper ( see figures 2 and 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "we will now investigate the correlation between variations in different energy bands .",

    "a minimum of 8 points was included in each frequency bin and the bin separation was fixed at 1.5 @xmath62 .",
    "as the poisson noise and other distorting effects in the observed light curves can artificially decrease the coherence , we applied the poisson noise correction factor described in @xcite and estimated any additional deviations using simulated light curves . for each pair of energy bands",

    "the average count rates of the simulated light curves were made to match the measured values and poisson deviates were added to each simulated light curve point .",

    "as seen in other agn and xrb , the hard band in  lags the softer band and the lag size decreases with increasing frequency with an approximately power law dependence .",

    "the real lag spectrum , plotted in black markers joined by a solid line in the same figure , drops more steeply than the simulations , indicating that the drop in high - frequency lags is not due to observational biases on an intrinsically @xmath74 lag spectrum .",

    ", the real data falls within the 95% extremes of the distribution of simulated lag spectra , but this model over predicts the scatter , putting almost the entire 95% lower limit on negative lag values .",
    "fitting the lag spectrum with a range of slopes between -1 and -1.84 and repeating this experiment produced simulated lag distributions that are either too tight and do not include the high - frequency lag points and/or too wide and over predict the scatter in the measured lag spectrum at low frequencies .",
    "therefore , the lag spectrum is not consistent with a single power law and the bend down or cut - off at around @xmath76 hz is real .",
    "@xcite found a similar change in slope in the lag spectrum of ark  564 , in that case however , the bend was found a decade in frequency below the bend frequency of the pds , while in  the bend in the pds and lag spectrum appear at the same frequency , within the uncertainties .",
    "the length of the time lags increases with the separation between the energies of the bands considered .",
    "we calculated lag spectra of the 0.20.4 kev to the 0.40.6 , 0.61 , 12 , 25 and 510 kev bands , finding that the higher the energy band , the more it lags the 0.20.4 kev band .",

    "it is possible that other spectral components in  below 2 kev , in particular the soft excess might be suppressing the intermediate - energy lags .",
    "we applied the propagating fluctuation paradigm of @xcite to attempt to reproduce the observed lag spectra . in this scenario ,",
    "the fluctuations are produced by the accretion flow over a large range in radius , and travel towards the centre to modulate the x - ray emitting region .",

    "this difference in spectral hardening implies that , for the model to work exactly , either the radial emissivity profiles are not exact power laws or that the emitted spectrum at each radius is not a power law .    as  is accreting at a high rate , an accretion disc with constant scale height @xmath117 , at least at the centre , can be more appropriate .",
    "@xcite solve the structure equations of a thin disc plus corona system , and show that the accretion flow represented by the corona is radiation pressure dominated at accretion rates above approximately 18% the eddington limit .",
    "as this is probably the case in , if we identify the corona with the accretion flow producing and propagating the variability , we should consider a scale - height radial dependence of @xmath118 . assuming that the same viscous velocity prescription applies in this case ,",

    "the measured bend frequency coincides precisely with the value predicted by the @xmath28 vs h@xmath39 line - width relation of @xcite , using the h@xmath39 line - width measurements of @xcite , which demonstrates the validity of this relation . *",
    "the power spectrum is energy - dependent with more high - frequency power at higher energies .",
    "the difference in the pdss of different energy bands indicates a shift in the pds bend to higher frequencies for higher energy bands .",
    "* the degree of coherence between variations in different energy bands decreases with the energy separation of the bands considered .",
    "the coherence is significantly lower than 1 , between the 0.20.6 and the 13 kev and 0.20.6 and 310 kev energy bands , even at the lowest frequencies sampled ( 4@xmath128 hz ) .",
    "* time lags are found between variations in different energy bands , where harder x - rays lag softer bands .",
    "the lag spectrum as a function of fourier frequency can be fit with a single power law of slope @xmath129 , much steeper than the lag spectra observed in other agn .",
    "alternatively , the lag spectrum of  is consistent with a power law of slope @xmath130 dropping to a steeper slope at around @xmath76hz , where the bend in the pds is also found .",
    "the latter shape resembles the high frequency end of lag spectra of cyg  x-1 in both low / hard and high / soft states .",
    "* the size of the time lags increases with energy separation following an almost log - linear relation . in all cases tested , using the energy bands 0.20.4 , 0.41 , 12 , 25 and 510 kev , any band lags all softer ones , at least at low frequencies where the error bars are small .",
    "+ @xcite have shown that the propagating - fluctuation paradigm of @xcite reproduces the shape of the pds and the rms - flux relation .",
    "this variability model is successful in producing variability over a very broad range of time - scales and it naturally predicts a cut - off at high frequencies . complemented with an extended emitting region whose spectrum hardens towards the centre , this model can explain the time lags @xcite and is compatible ( but does not ensure ) high coherence in the fluctuations of different energy bands .",
    "the extent of the emitting region in the model also acts as a low - pass filter reducing the high frequency power in the more extended energy bands , i.e. the softer bands , shifting the bend frequency to lower values .",
    "+ the energy dependence of the pds , together with the shape of the lag spectra of  are consistent with the predictions of this model , if the propagation speed is reduced by a factor of 28 , compared to the viscous velocity , depending on the disc structure .",
    "the lag spectra can be reproduced by a simple implementation of the model , with an emitted energy spectrum that hardens towards the centre .",
    "the energy dependence of the length of the time lags requires a maximum hardening of the spectrum with decreasing radius , between any radii @xmath131 and @xmath132 , of @xmath114 .",
    "we thank the referee for providing useful comments . this work has made use of observations obtained with , an esa science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by esa member states and the us ( nasa ) .",
