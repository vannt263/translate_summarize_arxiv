    "<S> we study kitaev model in one - dimension with open boundary condition by using exact analytic methods for non - interacting system in the half filled limit as well as in the symmetric case of @xmath0 , and by using density - matrix - renormalization - group method for interacting system with nearest neighbor repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> we show explicitly that the emergence of majorana zero mode is associated with the spontaneous symmetry broken of fermion number parity operator @xmath1 , which is @xmath2 for even number of fermions and @xmath3 for odd number of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in support of recent proposal by klassen and wen@xcite , who proposed such spontaneous symmetry broken in systems with majorana zero modes . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest and examine an edge correlation function of majorana fermions to characterize the long range order in the topological superconducting states and study the phase diagram of the interating kitaev chain . </S>"
