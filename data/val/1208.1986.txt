    "type ia supernovae ( sneia ; singular snia ) are bright , transient astronomical events identified by a peak - light spectrum showing no evidence of hydrogen but absorption lines of singly - ionized silicon  @xcite .",
    "these events follow from explosive thermonuclear burning of degenerate stellar material composed principally of c and o , which synthesizes @xmath1 of radioactive @xmath0 . the decay of this @xmath0 powers the light curve  @xcite .",
    "the progenitor systems of these explosions remain the subject of considerable debate and active research .",
    "observations , however , indicate these events largely form a homogeneous class .",
    "@xcite identified a relationship between the maximum b - band magnitude of an event and its rate of decline .",
    "this `` brighter equals broader '' relationship has been extended to additional bands with templates from nearby events , allowing these events to be calibrated as an extension of the astronomical distance ladder ( see @xcite for a description ) .",
    "this property , along with the brightness of sneia , which makes them visible over great distances , enables the use of sneia to probe the structure and expansion history of the universe , allowing studies of various cosmological models parameters  @xcite , with recent work constraining cosmological parameters to within a few percent  @xcite .",
    "recent observational studies of sneia have begun to correct for correlations of the brightness of a snia with properties of the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "many snia observations are restricted to broadband photometry , so knowledge of host galaxy properties is correlated .",
    "the inability to deconvolve these properties from each other is among the larger sources of uncertainty in cosmological constraints from sneia , so advancing the understanding of how brightness correlates with host galaxy properties may contribute significantly to reducing the uncertainties of cosmological parameters .",
    "the brightness , and therefore `` broadness '' , of a snia is determined principally by the amount of @xmath0 synthesized during the explosion .",
    "observations report that sneia appear to have an intrinsic scatter of a few tenths of a magnitude after calibration , forcing a minimum uncertainty in any distances measured by using sneia as standardizable candles  @xcite .",
    "an important goal of theoretical research into sneia , from the standpoint of cosmology , is to understand the sources of scatter and to identify potential systematic biases by studying the effects of various properties on the mechanism and nucleosynthetic yield of the snia .",
    "the surrounding stellar population , the metallicity and mass of the progenitor , the thermodynamic state of the progenitor , the cooling and accretion history of the progenitor , and other parameters are known to affect the lightcurves of sneia ; the role of these `` secondary '' parameters is the subject of considerable study  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additionally , many of these effects may be interconnected in complex ways  @xcite .",
    "observational campaigns are gathering information about sneia at an unprecedented rate . @xcite and @xcite showed that the delay time ( elapsed time between star formation and the supernova event ) data are best fit by a bimodal delay time distribution ( dtd ) with a prompt component that tracks less than 1 gyr after star formation and a tardy component that occurs several gyr later .",
    "@xcite demonstrate a correlation between brighter sneia and shorter delay times , which they state is consistent with the bimodality described by  @xcite , but also with a continuous relation .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite also find such a correlation between the delay time and brightness of a snia . while the degeneracy of age and metallicity in observations could obscure these correlations , @xcite note that the scatter in brightness of this observed relation is unlikely to be explained by the effect of metallicity .    for this theoretical study",
    ", we adopt the model known as the single - degenerate paradigm .",
    "this model assumes that a snia is the result of a thermonuclear disruption of a white dwarf ( wd ) in a mass - transferring binary system with either a main - sequence or red - giant companion star  .",
    "recent observational evidence , however , suggests other progenitors such as the merging of two white dwarfs may explain many events  @xcite . in the single - degenerate scenario ,",
    "the wd is formed when the primary star goes through a giant phase and expels a planetary nebula .",
    "once the primary becomes a wd , it is initially not in contact with the companion star , and it slowly cools as thermal energy is radiated away .",
    "once the companion star evolves and fills its roche lobe , mass - transfer begins to carry low - mass elements from the envelope of the companion to the surface of the wd . if the accretion rate exceeds @xmath2",
    "@xmath3  yr@xmath4 , the h - rich material can steadily burn  @xcite and the wd gains mass , which heats and compresses the wd , driving up both the temperature and density in the core . once the temperature rises enough for carbon burning to begin ,",
    "the core of the wd begins to convect ; this is known as the `` simmering '' phase .",
    "this simmering phase lasts on order of 10@xmath5  yr , and ends when a flame is ignited , which occurs approximately when the eddy turnover time becomes shorter than the local nuclear runaway time .",
    "our initial models attempt to parameterize the wd at the end of the simmering phase , just at the beginning of the thermonuclear deflagration , which will in turn cause an explosion that will disrupt the entire wd in a snia .",
    "the explosion mechanism we use ( within the single - degenerate paradigm ) is that of a deflagration to detonation transition ( ddt ) .",
    "after ignition , the flame propagates as a subsonic deflagration for a while and then transitions to a supersonic detonation that rapidly consumes the star  @xcite .",
    "we describe the details of our implementation of this explosion mechanism below .    in the single - degenerate paradigm , a longer delay time",
    "can be explained by a longer elapsed time between the formation of the wd and the onset of accretion . during this period ,",
    "the wd is in isolation and cools , hence the moniker the `` wd cooling time '' ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "following the cooling time is a period of accretion , during which the wd is compressed and heats , approaching the conditions for ignition of the thermonuclear runaway .",
    "the decrease in temperature during the cooling time , which is determined by @xmath6 , influences the density structure of the wd just prior to ignition , with a longer @xmath6   resulting in a higher central density when the core reaches the ignition temperature  @xcite .",
    "thus , a correlation between central density and the brightness of an event would suggest a correlation between delay time and the brightness of an event .    in this manuscript",
    ", we expand on our earlier investigation on the effect of @xmath6  on the brightness of the explosion . in  @xcite",
    "we reported that as the central density of the progenitor wd increases , the production of radioactive @xmath0 decreases due to increased neutronization rates , producing a dimmer event . using the results of @xcite , we related the wd central density to @xmath6  and were able to compare our results to the observations of @xcite . here",
    "we present additional details of our models ; a statistical analysis of the results including the assessment of intrinsic scatter ; the distribution of fe - group elements within the remnant ; and a potentially - observable effect to demonstrate the connection between age , progenitor central density , and brightness .",
    "we also revised our previously - reported trend in brightness with age to account for the main sequence evolution of the wd progenitor .    in section  [ sec : method ]",
    "we discuss the methodology of our suite of simulations , followed by details of the code we used to perform our simulations in section  [ sec : code ] .",
    "we present the results of our simulations in section  [ sec : results ] , and discuss how these results compare with previous studies in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] contains a brief summary and final conclusions .",
    "as described above , our explosion models assume the ddt mechanism in which a flame ignited in the core propagates as a subsonic deflagration and then transitions to a detonation .",
    "we simulate an explosion from ignition through the detonation phase until burning effectively ceases .",
    "our models are by necessity incomplete , however , in that we do not produce light curves and spectra with which we could compare to actual observations . instead , we rely on the mass of @xmath0 synthesized in our models and compare this result from our simulations to @xmath0 masses inferred from observations  @xcite .    for the study",
    ", we adopted the theoretical framework first applied in @xcite for a statistical study of a suite of simulations performed with randomized initial conditions .",
    "we constructed a set of five progenitor models with different central densities ( @xmath7 ) , and therefore slightly different masses , and from these performed suites of two - dimensional simulations . for each progenitor model we applied thirty sets of initial conditions consisting of randomized perturbations on an initially - burned region .",
    "we refer to each of these thirty as a realization , each of which is seeded by a random number used to generate a unique power spectrum of spherical harmonics ( see appendix  [ app : init ] for details of the realizations ) .",
    "the spectra are used as initial perturbations to a spherical `` match head '' in the center of the progenitor star .",
    "each progenitor wd had the same seed values applied , resulting in the same thirty perturbations .",
    "this procedure allows us to characterize the intrinsic scatter in the models and check for systematic biases in the realizations across different progenitors , such as how the morphology of the initial conditions may influence the final result .",
    "complete details of our models and simulations follow , but we preface the description by mentioning that one limitation of our study is the use of two - dimensional models and the parameterization of inherently three - dimensional phenomena . in particular , two - dimensional models lack any meaningful consideration of turbulence and its effect on the flame because the turbulence found in the interior of a simmering white dwarf and its interaction with the flame are inherently three - dimensional .",
    "the problem is compounded by the fact that this interaction occurs partially on unresolvable scales , necessitating use of sub - grid - scale models  ( see * ? ? ? * for an example ) .",
    "there are two critical ways that omitting consideration of turbulence influences this work .",
    "the first is in the calculation of flame speeds during the deflagration phase .",
    "the burning model ( described below ) relies on an input flame speed to propagate a model flame during the deflagration .",
    "turbulence will interact with this flame , stretching it and thereby boosting the burning rate ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "our present models boost the input flame speed from tabulated laminar values to compensate for buoyancy effects  @xcite but do not include the effect of turbulence - flame interactions for reasons discussed above .",
    "effectively , we assume the increase in flame surface ( and hence the burning rate ) is dominated by stretching due to buoyancy rather than turbulence .    the second critical way that omitting consideration of turbulence influences this work is in the criteria for the ddt  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "for this study , we parameterized the ddt criterion as a threshold density , @xmath8 , with a detonation initiated when the top of a rising plume of burned material reaches this density . as we describe below",
    ", this threshold density determines the duration of the deflagration and thus strongly influences the outcome of an explosion .",
    "our _ a priori _ choice for this parameter led to higher than expected yields of radioactive @xmath0 , necessitating a rescaling of our results for comparison to observations .",
    "confirmation of the trends we present from extrapolated results awaits a future study with a more consistent treatment of these issues .",
    "as demonstrated by @xcite , for a given zero - age main - sequence mass , the properties of a progenitor wd such as central temperature and density at ignition of the deflagration can be constructed as functions of @xmath6 .",
    "we take the leading - order effect from varying @xmath6 ; that is , vary @xmath7  while holding all other parameters constant .",
    "this choice allows us to disentangle the effects of @xmath7  from the effects of other parameters . for our @xmath7",
    ", we chose @xmath9  g  @xmath10 in steps of @xmath11  g  @xmath10 .",
    "we then constructed a series of five parameterized wd progenitor models in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "figure  [ fig : prog_tvrho ] presents the profiles of the progenitor wds in the @xmath12-@xmath13 plane .",
    "the core of each wd is isentropic due to convection , the intermediate ( `` envelope '' ) region is isothermal due to the high conductivity of degenerate matter , and the outer ( `` atmosphere '' ) region has a power - law temperature dependence that was chosen to mimic a radiative atmosphere . for a model to explode , the central temperature must be in the range where the carbon burning begins a runaway , which is approximately @xmath14  k. varying the isothermal envelope temperature would have a relatively insignificant effect on the mass , as the envelope contains only a small fraction of the mass ; primarily the mass is set by @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have chosen a central temperature at the low end of the carbon ignition range and allow the total mass to vary as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "table  [ tab : densitymass ] shows the total mass ( @xmath15 ) and mass of the isentropic core ( @xmath16 ) for each progenitor .",
    ".central densities , masses , and radii of progenitor wds .",

    "the structure and composition of the progenitor models are discussed in detail in section  [ sec : init ] , along with the creation of a statistical ensemble .",
    "the simulations and the code are discussed in section  [ sec : method ] .",
    "as we have stressed , the principal result from our simulations is a mass of @xmath0 .",
    "our models reproduce the qualitative description given in @xcite that produces a type ia supernova light curve .",
    "the ideal solution for comparing our results to observed light would be for us to post - process our results with a radiation transfer method to actually calculate light curves . in the absence of that technology , we may infer observed properties of supernova events suggested by our results .",

    "<S> we present a study exploring a systematic effect on the brightness of type ia supernovae using numerical models that assume the single - degenerate paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation varied the central density of the progenitor white dwarf at flame ignition , and considered its impact on the explosion yield , particularly the production and distribution of radioactive @xmath0 , which powers the light curve . </S>",
    "<S> we performed a suite of two - dimensional simulations with randomized initial conditions , allowing us to characterize the statistical trends that we present . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations indicate that production of fe - group material is statistically independent of progenitor central density , but the mass of stable fe - group isotopes is tightly correlated with central density , with a decrease in the production of @xmath0 at higher central densities . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply progenitors with higher central densities produce dimmer events . </S>",
    "<S> we provide details of the post - explosion distribution of @xmath0 in the models , including the lack of a consistent centrally - located deficit of @xmath0 , which may be compared to observed remnants . by performing a self - consistent extrapolation of our model yields and considering the main - sequence lifetime of the progenitor star and the elapsed time between the formation of the white dwarf and the onset of accretion </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a brightness - age relation that improves our prediction of the expected trend for single degenerates and we compare this relation with observations . </S>"
