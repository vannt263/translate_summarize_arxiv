    "nonlinear rheological behavior of glassy materials under stationary shearing has attracted considerable attention in recent years since it provides additional insight into the physics of glass transition  @xcite . for such systems driven far from equilibrium",
    ", the shear rate should be regarded as a relevant control parameter rather than as a small perturbation  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we develop a nonequilibrium statistical mechanical theory for glass - forming systems in which the shear rate as well as temperature and density can be handled as external control parameters .",
    "this will be done by extending the projection - operator formalism  @xcite and the mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite to nonequilibrium systems .",
    "mct has been known as the most successful microscopic theory for the glass transition . indeed , extensive tests of the theoretical predictions carried out so far against experimental data and computer - simulation results suggest that the theory deals properly with some essential features of glass - forming systems  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore natural that extensions of mct have been attempted to stationary sheared systems .    at present there",
    "exist two different approaches in such nonequilibrium extensions of mct : one based on steady - state fluctuations  @xcite , and the other based on the transient time - correlation function ( ttcf ) formalism  @xcite . in the former approach ,",
    "basic objects are the steady - state density correlators defined with fluctuations around the stationary state .",
    "rheological properties like the shear stress are then expressed within the mode - coupling approximation in terms of these steady - state correlators . with the same spirit as mct for quiescent systems  @xcite , the structure factor @xmath0 of the stationary state , which now depends on the shear rate as well as on the wave `` vector '' @xmath1 , enters as input into the equations describing the dynamics . at first sight",
    ", such an approach looks quite reasonable , but in fact it possesses a conceptual problem . for example , the following exact relation holds between the interaction part of the steady - state shear stress @xmath2 and the steady - state pair - correlation function @xmath3 @xmath4 for a uniform shear with velocity along the @xmath5-axis and its gradient along the @xmath6-axis  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath7 denotes the average number density , and @xmath8 the pair - interaction potential . since @xmath0 is related to the fourier transform of @xmath3 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ss - shear - kirkwood ] ) states that @xmath0 and @xmath2 should be handled on an equal footing , but this aspect is missing in the steady - state - fluctuations approach of refs .",
    "@xcite where @xmath0 is treated as the input while @xmath2 is the output .",
    "in addition , it is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) holds also in the nonequilibrium stationary state .",
    "the use of such an assumption is unjustified since the violations of the fdt have been reported in the computer - simulation study of sheared systems  @xcite .    on the other hand , no such problems arise in the theory developed by fuchs and cates ( fc )  @xcite which is based on the ttcf formalism  @xcite .",
    "starting from the smoluchowski equation for interacting brownian particles under stationary shearing , the fc theory aims at describing steady - state properties via two steps : firstly , the mct equations for the _ transient _ density correlators  the correlators between the density fluctuations in the equilibrium starting state and the ones at later times after the shearing force is turned on  are formulated , and then the ttcf formalism is used which , combined with the mode - coupling approximation , expresses stationary - state properties in terms of these transient correlators . in this approach , only _ equilibrium _",
    "static structure factor is required as input , whereas the steady - state structure factor @xmath0 as well as the shear stress @xmath2 are the output of the theory .",
    "thus , the aforementioned conceptual problem in refs .",
    "@xcite does not apply here .",
    "furthermore , it is in principle possible using the fc theory to investigate the violations of the fdt , although this issue has not yet been addressed .",
    "it is expected on physical grounds that the microscopic dynamics does not matter as far as the long - time glassy dynamics is concerned .",
    "indeed , it was argued that the equilibrium mct leads to the same glass transition scenario for both newtonian and brownian microscopic dynamics  @xcite , and this was confirmed by computer - simulation studies  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not _ a priori _ obvious whether such an equivalent long - time dynamics holds true also for nonequilibrium sheared systems .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a nonequilibrium mct starting from the sllod equations  @xcite  newtonian equations of motion under stationary shearing  which have been widely adopted in simulation studies of homogeneously sheared systems ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "our theory follows the fc formulation in that the mct equations for the transient density correlators are derived first , and then the ttcf formalism is used for describing stationary - state properties .",
    "however , we found that , although it is not difficult to adapt the fc formulation in ref .",
    "@xcite to the sllod equations at the formal level , the resulting equations are too cumbersome to be useful in practice .",
    "we therefore developed an alternative formulation to be presented in the following .",
    "it is found that a new memory kernel enters into our nonequilibrium mct equations reflecting the non - hermitian nature of the relevant liouville operator , which is absent in the fc theory formulated with the brownian microscopic dynamics . in what circumstances this additional memory kernel from our theory matters",
    "is an open question .",
    "we shall elaborate on this at the end of the paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : microscopic - starting - point ] , we derive exact microscopic equations and relations for systems subjected to stationary shearing .",

    "appendix  [ appen : isotropic - app ] describes details of the isotropic approximation which is useful in practical applications of our theory to systems where anisotropy in the density fluctuations is small .",
    "in this section , we derive exact microscopic equations and relations subjected to stationary shearing along with thermostat .",
    "these exact results serve a basis for developing a nonequilibrium mct for sheared systems to be presented in later sections .",
    "we shall consider a system of @xmath9 atoms of mass @xmath10 in a volume @xmath11 subjected to stationary shearing characterized by the shear - rate tensor @xmath12 .",

    "the momenta @xmath24 , referred to as the sllod momenta , are peculiar with respect to the streaming velocity @xmath25 at the particle position @xmath18 , and satisfy @xmath26 .",
    "the thermostatting multiplier @xmath27 controls the kinetic temperature or some other quantity such as the internal energy .",
    "there exist various types of thermostats  stochastic or deterministic , and reversible or irreversible ones  considered in the literature . among them ,",
    "the gaussian isokinetic thermostat has acquired a respected status and a special importance  @xcite . however , from a fundamental point of view , there is no privileged thermostat , and one should not attribute a fundamental role to special assumptions about such models since they simply describe various ways to take out energy from the system .",
    "indeed , it has been conjectured that different thermostats may lead to the same steady - state properties , in the usual sense of the macroscopic equivalence of equilibrium ensembles  @xcite .",
    "although no proof is yet available , it is at least reasonable to expect that steady - state properties do not significantly depend on the types of the thermostats , and this has been tacitly assumed in simulation studies where various models have been used as practical means to control the temperature .    in the present work , we shall adopt a constant-@xmath27 thermostat in which the multiplier @xmath27 can be regarded as a `` friction '' constant . as we will see later",
    ", this thermostat greatly simplifies the equations to be handled compared , e.g. , to the corresponding equations under the gaussian isokinetic thermostat whose multiplier @xmath28 reads  @xcite @xmath29 how the steady - state temperature can be controlled with the constant-@xmath27 model will be discussed in sec .",
