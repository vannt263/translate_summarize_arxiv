    "after decades of neutrino oscillation experiments , it is generally taken for granted that neutrinos are massive particles that can vary among all the three flavors through the oscillation process described by neutrino mixing .",
    "one of the most important issues concerning neutrino mixing is the determination of the neutrino mixing matrix , i.e. , the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata  ( pmns ) matrix  @xcite , which is the lepton sector counterpart of the quark sector mixing matrix , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa  ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "the pmns matrix is defined as the correlation matrix linking neutrino flavor eigenstates @xmath0 and mass eigenstates @xmath1 , @xmath2 this mixing matrix is conventionally represented in the standard chau - keung ( ck ) scheme  @xcite as    @xmath3    where three mixing angles are denoted by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , with their trigonometric functions @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . represented by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc . respectively .",
    "the _ cp_-violating phase is denoted by @xmath11 , meanwhile @xmath12 and @xmath13 represent the other two phases in the case of majorana neutrinos . in the case of dirac neutrinos ,",
    "the latter two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 can be removed by redefinition , thus there remain only four independent parameters , i.e. , three mixing angles together with one _ cp_-violating phase .",
    "if the neutrinos are of majorana type , the two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 are needed for a full determination of the mixing matrix .",
    "as the majorana phases do not manifest themselves in the oscillation , we ignore these two phases @xmath12 and @xmath13 and take only the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ cke ] ) in this article . by now , the quark - sector mixing matrix has been measured with good precision . in the lepton sector , the values of the three mixing angles have been measured after years of neutrino oscillation experiments , though with relatively lower precision compared to the quark case .",
    "the explicit form of the fermion mixing matrix is not unique and an alternative scheme is the kobayashi - maskawa  ( km ) scheme  @xcite @xmath14 in the km scheme , as will be mentioned later , the _ cp_-violating phase of the quark sector is quite near @xmath15 , leading to the hypothesis of `` maximal _ cp _ violation ''  @xcite .",
    "besides the ck and km schemes , in ref .",
    "@xcite all the other possible schemes of the mixing matrix are considered and presented .",
    "there are actually 12 schemes of mixing matrix . among them",
    ", 3 schemes can be transformed into others through straightforward redefinition of mixing angles , thus leaving 9 different schemes  @xcite , whose forms are provided in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] .",
    "quark - lepton complementarity  ( qlc )  @xcite and self - complementarity  ( sc )  @xcite are phenomenological relations of quark and lepton mixing angles .",
    "they provide a novel connection to link quarks and leptons .",
    "they can be expressed in a more clear way as ( [ qlcsc1])-([qlcsc4 ] ) : @xmath16 ( from now on we use @xmath17 to represent lepton sector mixing angles to distinguish them from quark sector mixing angles @xmath18 . )    here we have marked the two qlc relations by qlc1 and qlc2 , and the two slightly different sc relations by sc1 and sc2 respectively .",
    "originally these phenomenological relations are observed only in the ck scheme and fit the experimental results within small errors .",
    "however , a question naturally arises , i.e. , whether these relations still hold in schemes other than the ck scheme since we can not find any justification for the priority of the ck scheme .",
    "there are already some researches on qlc and sc in the nine schemes  @xcite .",
    "however , all of these examinations of qlc and sc are carried out under some fixed phase choices . since the _ cp_-violating phase of the lepton sector",
    "is not determined from current experiment , in this article we examine qlc and sc with the whole range variation of the lepton _ cp_-violating phase .",
    "these will be treated in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] and sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .",
    "we purpose to make a detailed re - analysis of qlc and sc in all the nine schemes , emphasizing on the influences due to the variation of the lepton _ cp_-violating phase . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we use the latest experiment results to do calculations on mixing angles and _ cp_-violating phases in all the nine schemes . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we focus on qlc , examine these complementarity relations and make some analyses . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we similarly examine and analyze sc . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we discuss some properties of _",
    "cp_-violating phases among different schemes with a suggestion of convention redefinition , and suggest some empirical relations among quark _ cp_-violating phases in different schemes .",
    "first we list all the nine schemes mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec1 ] in table  [ tabscheme ] .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "some empirical relations we can easily read out are listed here : @xmath19 in fact , ( [ 1 ] ) are satisfied by the similarities between their mixing angles . from table",
    "[ tab1 ] , we have these relations approximately  ( here @xmath20 represents @xmath21 in p@xmath22 scheme ) : @xmath23 then using the scheme - independent jarlskog invariant , we get @xmath24 justifying the relation ( [ 1 ] ) . by the same way , ( [ 3 ] )",
    "is justified through the similarities among mixing angles in p6 , p8 , and p9 .",
    "relation ( [ 2 ] ) states possible maximal _ cp _ violation as we discussed before , and relation ( [ 4 ] ) merely reflects the relative largeness of the three mixing angles in p7 . with the existence of _ cp _",
    "violation confirmed , @xmath25 can not be exactly @xmath26 though close to it  @xcite .",
    "we are willing to find out some similar empirical relations on lepton _ cp_-violating phases .",
    "unfortunately , similar relations can not be easily found , because the lepton mixing angles are quite different from each other in different schemes , thus invalidating our method used for the quark sector .",
    "from the results of sec .  [ sec3 ] and sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , the validation of qlc and sc depends on the choices of schemes and lepton _ cp_-violating phases , and careful inspections should be carried out when we consider the generalization of qlc and sc from the standard ck scheme to the other eight schemes . on the issues of _ cp_-violating phases , restrictions on lepton _ cp_-violating phases in p6@xmath27p9 are recognized .",
    "simultaneous maximal _",
    "violation in both the quark and the lepton sector is possible in the p2 and p3 scheme .",
    "a redefinition of _ cp_-violating phases for unification is suggested and some empirical relations on the quark _ cp_-violating phases are explored .",
    "all of these results may enrich our knowledge of qlc , sc relations , and _ cp_-violating phases , helping us understand the mystery of lepton mixing .",
