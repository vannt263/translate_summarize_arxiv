    "maxwell s demon could separate hot atoms from cold , and therefore could obtain work from a single heat bath .",
    "this seemed to violate the second law of thermodynamics @xcite and led to discussions and confusions until 1929 , when szilard devised his szilard engine  ( sze ) @xcite .",
    "the sze could extract work from a bath using classical information ( acquired by measurement of the atom ) and establish the connection between work and entropy to reassure the validation of the second law of thermodynamics , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . later , landauer @xcite and bennett @xcite completely analyzed the sze , and showed that the erasure or reset of the demon memory costs at least the energy of @xmath3 associated with the entropy decrease of the engine .",
    "it was conjectured @xcite that there exists a general equivalence relation between information and work ; namely , that by having any information @xmath4 about the state of a physical system , it is possible , by allowing the system to relax to its maximum - entropy state , to convert into mechanical work an amount of heat @xmath5 without any entropy increase in the environment .",
    "moreover , there are many works on the relationship between information and work , and some significant results have been obtained @xcite .",
    "research interests in the sze have recently been revived in various theoretical contexts @xcite and experimental implementations @xcite . however , early literatures hardly paid attention to fully quantum analysis except for those via measurement process @xcite .",
    "sang wook kim noticed that work is required in the process of insertion for a quantum szilard engine ( qsze ) @xcite .",

    "energy levels in the box vary with the boundary conditions , contributing to the quantum thermodynamic work and the system s internal energy .",
    "both the position of the insertion and the rate of increase of the potential barrier height influence the level shifts .",
    "the faster the height of the potential barrier increases , the greater the change of internal energy of the system and the energy becomes infinite when the height tends to infinity instantaneously , i.e. , the insertion is carried out instantaneously , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "if the system is initially in the ground state and the insertion is performed adiabatically with the barrier being not at the center of the box , the particle will end up definitely in the larger part of the box @xcite which is different from the classical situation . in the case of isothermal insertion",
    "the effect of energy level shifts is concealed by the heat exchange .",
    "so in order to demonstrate the quantum effects of the qsze completely , it is necessary to consider the adiabatic insertion . in this paper",
    "we assume that the insertion is performed adiabatically and analyze the cycle of the qsze with fully quantum considerations .",
    "it is interesting to note that energy level shifts caused by the boundary conditions during the insertion process play a significant role in extracting work or absorbing heat in the qsze .    .",

    "we consider a single particle in one - dimensional infinite square well , and devise two different cyclic strategies .",
    "for these two cyclic strategies we are able to know explicitly the quantities of work done by the system , heat transferred , and the change in internal energy in each step . in this way we can derive the general expressions of heat transferred from the bath and the total work done by the system . we find that the quantum information plays a decisive role in the whole cycle and is associated with heat absorbed from the bath and work done by the system .",
    "however , the classical information of the particle being located at seems to behave like a feedback controller , and has no direct effect on heat absorption .",
    "this is the first demonstration of the different effects between quantum information and classical information for extracting heat from the bath in the qsze .",

    "in this section we will present two different cyclic strategies , one with isothermal expansion as illustrated in fig . 2 and the other with adiabatic expansion in fig .",
    "each strategy consists of four steps : adiabatic insertion , measurement , expansion and removal .",
    "the first two steps , adiabatic insertion and measurement , usually are performed simultaneously and can be considered as one .",
    "we also assume that measurement is perfect , and the case of imperfect measurement has been discussed in ref . @xcite . in order to reveal the physics behind each process",
    ", we calculate the internal energy , work , heat and the entropy change in each step .",
    "it is widely accepted that when a wall is inserted at any position of the box , there is no heat and work accompanied by in the csze . however , this is not the case in the qsze .",
    "analogous to the classical insertion , the corresponding quantum process is characterized by increasing the height of the potential barrier .",
    "adiabatic insertion @xmath35 implies that the system is isolated from the heat bath and the potential barrier increases very slowly at the center of potential well @xmath36 .",
    "one can model the potential @xmath37where @xmath38 varies from zero to infinity adiabatically .",
    "the insertion of the impenetrable barrier is completed at @xmath39    appendix a shows the detailed calculations of the energy level shifts during the adiabatic insertion ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "there are two situations when the insertion takes place at @xmath36 .",
    "the _ odd - parity _ eigenfunctions @xmath40 remain the same in full space , because the insertion point is the same as nodes of the odd - parity eigenfunctions such that the system can not detect and therefore does not resist the insertion .",
    "when the insertion is completed , @xmath40 become the eigenfunction @xmath41 in the left and right subspaces with equal probability .",
    "since @xmath42 , the energy levels do not shift in this situation .",
    "the insertion changes the _ even - parity _ eigenfunctions latexmath:[$%    eigenenergies also vary with the insertion rate @xcite . when the adiabatic insertion is completed , these eigenfunctions become latexmath:[$%    probability such that @xmath42 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath44 will shift upward to the nearest level @xmath45 .",
    "since the potential tends to infinity when the insertion is completed , the box will be divided into two independent unrelated subspaces , and the particle will be either in the left subspace or the right subspace with the same probability , @xmath46 .",
    "so the cross terms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in the density matrix of the system @xmath49 , become zero after the insertion and @xmath49 reads as @xmath50the density matrices of subspaces @xmath51 and @xmath52 can be expressed as @xmath53@xmath54and @xmath55@xmath56where @xmath16 and @xmath57 denote the left subspace and the right subspace .",

    "( [ 15 ] ) shows that the information change in the insertion consists of two parts : the increased classical information @xmath78 , and the decreased quantum information , @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "this implies that in the insertion process the classical information increases while the quantum information decreases .",
    "in addition , it is noted that though the heat exchange is zero in the adiabatic insertion , @xmath35 , the entropy change of the system , @xmath80 , is not equal to zero because this process is a non - equilibrium process , and the relation @xmath81 does nt hold any more .",
    "the classical information and the quantum information are acquired from different origins .",
    "the former comes from the position distribution of the particle , while the later comes from the probability distribution of the energy levels in quantum system which is obtained at the expense of the work done by the outside agent . in the whole cycle",
    ", they also play different roles .",
    "the classical information @xmath78 seems to behave like a feedback controller determining the moving direction of the barrier and does not contribute to the heat absorption , however , the quantum information @xmath82 determines the heat absorbed .",
    "we will show the differences specifically in subsequent sections .",
    "we make a measurement to localize the particle in one of two sides of the well . after the measurement the classical information becomes zero and",
    "the particle , we assume , is in the left side ( same discussions when it is in the right ) .",
    "then the feedback is finished .",
    "based on the result of the feedback , the barrier will eventually reach the right end of the well .",
    "the state @xmath83 , after measurement , collapses into @xmath84 in the left space .",
