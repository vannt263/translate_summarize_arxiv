    "the two distributions are not very different .",
    "fo-@xmath4 cepheids show somewhat stronger preference for negative @xmath20 , but otherwize , in both types of overtone pulsators nonradial modes are found in similar distances from the radial mode .",
    "the only difference between the two histograms is the presence of high frequency secondary peaks ( @xmath21 ) in the cepheids , but not in the rr  lyrae stars .",
    "although the population of fo cepheids in the lmc extends down to periods as short as 0.4day , nonradial modes were detected only in stars with @xmath22day .",
    "in fact , the incidence rate of nonradial modes systematically increases with the primary pulsation period , reaching 19% for stars with @xmath23day .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3 .",
    "we interpret this behaviour as a selection effect : the cepheids with longer periods are brighter , consequently it is easier to detect very low amplitude secondary periodicities in their lightcurves .",

    "i.e. _ with the same strange ratio which is frequently observed in the fo-@xmath4 cepheids .",
    "clearly , nonradial modes excited in the fu / fo-@xmath4 cepheids are somehow connected with the first radial overtone .",

    "in the last decade nonradial modes have been detected in many rr  lyrae stars belonging to various stellar systems , including both magellanic clouds and the galactic bulge .",
    "since pulsations of cepheids and of rr  lyrae stars are in many ways similar , it is instructive to compare the properties of nonradial modes in these two types of stars .",
    "several obvious differences should be pointed out :    * amplitudes of nonradial modes in classical cepheids are an order of magnitude _ smaller _ than in rr  lyrae stars . * in rr  lyrae stars , nonradial modes are detected both in fundamental mode pulsators ( rrab ) and in first overtone pulsators ( rrc ) . in classical cepheids nonradial modes",
