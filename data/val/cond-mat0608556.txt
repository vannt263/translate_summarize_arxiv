    "the systematic investigation of melting kinetics in alloys , and particular in eutectic and peritectic systems , is much less developed than the investigation of solidification ( for a recent review on solidification see , for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "microstructures , being at the center of materials science and engineering , are formed during the solidification process and , in this sense , the melting process is less attractive for practical applications .",
    "however , the interfacial pattern selection problem during the melting process might be very interesting .",
    "for example , in our previous publications @xcite we discussed a free boundary problem for two moving interfaces that strongly interact via the diffusion field in the liquid layer between them .",
    "this problem arises in the context of liquid film migration during the partial melting of solid alloys @xcite and could also be relevant to the sintering process in the presence of the liquid phase @xcite . for the melting of one - phase alloys to proceed in this way",
    ", the local equilibrium concentrations have to be different for the two interfaces providing the driving force for the process .",
    "it is by now well accepted ( see , for example , @xcite ) that the difference of the equilibrium states at the melting and solidification fronts is due to the coherency strain energy which is important only at the melting front because of the sharp concentration profile ahead the moving melting front .",
    "the other source of elastic deformations during the melting process , even in pure materials , is the density difference between the solid and the liquid phase .",
    "if the melt inclusion is entirely inside the solid matrix , inhomogeneous elastic deformations inevitably arise .",
    "the peculiar behavior of the melting kinetics in such systems was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to describe the problem of contact melting in eutectic and peritectic systems along the boundary between two solid phases ( see fig . 1 and fig .",
    "the local concentrations at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interfaces in such systems are different because of the chemical difference between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 phases , and weak coherency strain effects are not so important here . if we also assume that the liquid phase extends up to the sample surfaces , the mentioned elastic deformations due the density difference are not important either , because a weak hydrodynamic flow inside the liquid phase compensates the density difference .",
    "we concentrate here on the velocity selection problem during the melting along the solid - solid interface .",
    "the presence of the triple junction ( see fig.1b and fig .",
    "2b ) plays a crucial role in this process . in the classical problem of dendritic growth , where the triple junction is not present , the velocity selection is controlled by tiny singular effects of the anisotropy of the surface energy ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "the triple junction produces a very strong perturbation of the liquid - solid interfaces and controls the velocity selection .",
    "the other important difference compared to the classical dendritic problem is that the kinetics of the contact melting in eutectic and peritectic systems is controlled by the diffusion inside the needle - like liquid phase and not in the outer phase .",
    "all features of the contact melting process mentioned so far are common for both systems .",
    "there is , however , important difference between eutectic and peritectic systems . in the eutectic system ( fig .",
    "1 ) both interfaces @xmath0 and @xmath1 are melting fronts while in the peritectic system ( fig.2 ) the @xmath0 interface is a solidification front if the temperature @xmath4 is above the peritectic temperature @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , during the melting of peritectic systems the low - temperature @xmath3-phase melts while the high - temperature @xmath2-phase solidifies .",
    "it means that , additionally to the formation of the liquid phase , the polymorphic transition @xmath6 occurs . in this context",
    "the contact melting in the peritectic system is similar to the process of liquid film migration , mentioned above , where the liquid film is also located between melting and solidification fronts .    finally , we discuss in this paper the evolution of the solid - solid interface due to surface diffusion .",
    "this process inevitably arises due to the deviation of the interface from a flat configuration in the vicinity of a triple junction .",
    "we show , however , that surface diffusion does not play a controlling role in the melting kinetics , and only allows for the necessarily adjustment of the solid - solid interface .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional problem of the simultaneous melting of two eutectic phases @xmath2 and @xmath3 along the boundary between them . the phase diagram and the configuration of different interfaces near the triple junction",
    "are schematically presented in fig.1 .",
    "the compositions of the solid phases are close to their equilibrium values @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the eutectic temperature .",
    "we assume that diffusion in the solid phases is very slow .",
    "the temperature of the sample , @xmath4 , is slightly above the eutectic temperature @xmath9 ( for the notations see fig.1 ) . at small overheating the concentration field in the liquid",
    ", @xmath10 obeys the laplace equation @xmath11 we assume local equilibrium at the liquid - solid interfaces .",
    "then the concentrations at the @xmath0 and @xmath1 interfaces are : @xmath12 here the notations of the different concentrations are clear from the phase diagram ( fig .",
    "1a ) ; the capillary lengths are @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the surface energy of the @xmath15 interface , @xmath16 is atomic volume which is assumed to be the same in all three phases , @xmath17 is the free energy of the liquid phase per atom and @xmath18 is its second derivative with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "the mass balance conditions at these interfaces read : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the diffusion coefficient in the liquid phase .",
    "( [ equil])-([mass ] ) are written for the case of small angles @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the triple junction .",
    "this leads to the small angles along the whole interface , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "in this case we can use the so - called `` lubrication '' approximation for the solution of the laplace equation . in this approximation one",
    "neglects the derivatives with respect to the `` slow '' @xmath27 variable as compared with the derivatives with respect to the `` fast '' @xmath28 variable :    @xmath29    the slow variable functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be found from the boundary condition , eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) : @xmath32 from eqs .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and ( [ concentration ] ) we find the following relations , @xmath33 which together with eqs .",
    "( [ constant ] ) and ( [ equil ] ) form a closed system of two second order differential equations for the front profiles @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "they are subject to the boundary conditions at the triple junction : @xmath36 @xmath37 ( see fig .",
    "it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ prof ] ) and ( [ bound1 ] ) that @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "we also find from eq .",
    "( [ bound2 ] ) that @xmath40 the relation ( [ match ] ) allows to eliminate the profile @xmath41 and to write the closed equation for the profile @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , one can integrate this equation once with respect to @xmath27 and finally obtains a nonlinear first order differential equation for the profile @xmath42 : @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the dimensionless overheating above the eutectic temperature .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless coordinates : @xmath45 then eq . ( [ first ] ) takes the form @xmath46 with the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 : @xmath48 the solution of this equation starts at the origin with @xmath49 and should have parabolic asymptotics @xmath50 for large values of @xmath51 .",
    "it turns out that such a smooth solution exists only if the parameter @xmath52 . in other words",
    ", this is a nonlinear eigenvalue problem which leads to the selection of the velocity @xmath53 : @xmath54 we see that the posed problem has a relatively simple , essentially analytical solution .",
    "the phase diagram and the configuration of different interfaces near the triple junction are schematically presented in fig.2 .",
    "the temperature of the sample is @xmath4 and slightly above the peritectic temperature @xmath5 ( for the notations see fig.2a ) .",
    "overheating is assumed to be small and the compositions of the solid phases are close to the equilibrium values @xmath7 and @xmath8 at the peritectic temperature .",
    "( [ laplace])-([mass ] ) are valid also for the peritectic system where @xmath55 should be replace by @xmath56 and in the second equation in ( [ equil ] ) one should change the sign in front of the capillary term , @xmath57 this reflects the fact that the equilibrium between the @xmath3-phase and the liquid phase corresponds to the negative slope of the liquidus line for the peritectic phase diagram and to the positive slope for the eutectic diagram . as a result , eqs .",
    "( [ match])-([angle ] ) remain the same and eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) is replaced by @xmath58    we note that the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the peritectic system ( fig .",
    "2 ) are negative if we define them in the same way as for the eutectic system : @xmath61 thus , replacing @xmath62 by @xmath63 and @xmath64 by @xmath65 , we recover eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 finally , for the steady - state velocity we obtain @xmath68 as we have already noted in the introduction , the interface @xmath69 represents now a solidification front . during the melting , in the peritectic system ,",
    "the low - temperature @xmath3-phase melts while the high - temperature @xmath2-phase solidifies .",
    "in addition to the formation of the liquid phase the polymorphic transition @xmath6 takes place .",
    "we have already mentioned that diffusion along the solid - solid interface plays an important role allowing the necessary rotation of the structure in the vicinity of the triple junction , @xmath70 ( see fig .",
    "1b and fig .",
    "at the same time , far away from the triple junction , the solid - solid interface is parallel to the @xmath27 axis ( @xmath71 ) .    the corresponding surface diffusion equation which describes the @xmath72 interface has been discussed in @xcite and , essentially , it is given by the classical mullins equation @xcite : @xmath73 in this description the diffusion takes place inside of layer of the thickness @xmath74 ( diffusion coefficient is @xmath75 ) and @xmath76 is the corresponding capillary length : @xmath77 } { 2(c_{\\beta}-c_{\\alpha})^2f_{\\alpha}''(c_{\\alpha})f_{\\beta}''(c_{\\beta})}.\\ ] ] here @xmath78 is the free energy of the @xmath79 phase per atom .",

    "this solution is uniquely defined because the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath22 and @xmath86 are known from the solution given in the previous sections .",
    "the velocity is given by eqs .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) and ( [ velocity1 ] ) for the eutectic and peritectic systems respectively ; the angle @xmath22 is given by eq .",
    "( [ angle ] ) for both cases and the curvature of the @xmath87 interface at the triple junction , @xmath88 , is also known since we have already found the concentrations at the triple junction .",
    "the procedure of calculation of @xmath86 is straightforward but tedious and involves new thermodynamical parameters .",
    "therefore , we explain this procedure only schematically : the concentrations in the solid phases at the triple junction can be calculated , on one hand , using the condition of local equilibrium with the liquid phase ( along the @xmath89 interface ) and , on the other hand , using the condition of local equilibrium between two solid phases ( along the @xmath90 interface ) . at the triple junction",
    "these compositions should coincide .",
    "the capillary corrections to the equilibrium solid concentrations can be written similar to eq .",
    "( [ equil ] ) for all there interfaces .",
    "since the profiles @xmath41 and @xmath42 have been already found , the mentioned continuity condition allows to calculate the curvature @xmath86 of the solid - solid interface .",
    "we note , however , that the term @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ ab ] ) is of order @xmath92 and can be neglected compared to @xmath22 for small @xmath60 .",
    "this means that the tedious calculations explained above are not needed in the limit of small @xmath60 .",
    "we also note that the characteristic length scales of the solid - solid interfacial pattern are small compared to the characteristic length scales of the melt structures by the same small parameter @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , the diffusional flux along the solid - solid interface has a nonzero value at the triple junction . in principal , this flux has to be taken into account in the description of the diffusional field in the liquid phase .",
    "this effect has been neglected in the previous sections .",
    "more careful analysis shows that corrections to eq .",
    "( 6 ) due to this effects are small by the same small parameter , @xmath94 thus , in the limit of small @xmath60 the surface diffusion process has no influence on the kinetics of the contact melting and allows only for the necessarily adjustment of the solid - solid interface inside the relatively small region in the vicinity of the triple junction .",
    "we have developed and analyzed a relatively simple model for the melting kinetics along the solid - solid inter - phase boundaries in eutectic and peritectic systems .",
    "the process is controlled by the diffusion inside the liquid phase and the existence of the triple junction is crucial for the velocity selection problem .",
    "the additional assumption of small opening angles @xmath95 at the triple junction plays only a technical role and allows to solve the posed problem essentially analytically using the lubrication approximation for the diffusion field in the liquid phase .",
    "the obtained scaling results for the dependence of the steady - state velocity of the moving pattern on the overheating , which are exact in the limit of small angles , can still be used for the moderate values of the angles with only prefactors of the order of unity missing .",
    "we note the obtained scaling relation , @xmath96 , is similar to the scaling relation in eutectic growth . using eq .",
    "( [ velocity ] ) and characteristic values of the parameters @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 we estimate the characteristic velocity to be of the order of @xmath101 .",
