    "in a recent paper @xcite , two of us proposed a general scenario for unification of dark matter and inflation into a single field .",
    "the key ingredient is the survival of a residual amount of the inflaton field s energy density , which undergoes coherent oscillations and can serve as a cold dark matter candidate . in the context of the string landscape , one can further argue for a non - zero vacuum energy of this field on anthropic grounds , thus providing a single description of the three key unknowns of modern cosmology , namely dark energy , dark matter , and the material responsible for early universe inflation .    in practice , however , realizing this scenario is non - trivial , due to the need for a long radiation - dominated era of the universe encompassing the nucleosynthesis period .",
    "this requires that the amplitude of scalar field oscillations be extremely small after the energy trapped in the inflaton is released into normal particles .",
    "preheating scenarios can provide part of the required reduction of the oscillation amplitude , but still leave it too high and in conflict with the observed dark matter to radiation density ratio .    in this paper",
    ", we explore a modification to the original scenario of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as we shall discuss below , after preheating the universe undergoes a short period of radiation quickly followed by a period of matter domination driven by the relic energy density of the inflaton field itself .",
    "this early matter domination period is interrupted by a short second period of inflation , known as thermal inflation , driven by a separate field and perhaps associated with the supersymmetry breaking transition .",
    "we find that thermal inflation can reduce the oscillation amplitude of the scalar field to the desired level , and then provide a proper reheating of the universe .",
    "for definiteness , we consider throughout the model of ref .",
    "@xcite where the inflaton @xmath0 has potential @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 has the small value needed to explain the observed dark energy density , and otherwise does not play a significant role . for sufficiently large @xmath3 ,",
    "this potential drives inflation and produces density perturbations in agreement with observations provided @xmath4 .",
    "subsequently @xmath5 at all times , where @xmath6 is the hubble parameter , and the @xmath0 field oscillates rapidly on the hubble timescale .",
    "such an oscillating field behaves as cold dark matter , both in the redshifting of the mean density @xmath7 and in the evolution of perturbations .    unless some mechanism exists to reduce the energy density of the oscillating field , and",
    "indeed to transform some of it into conventional material , it is not possible to recover a satisfactory big bang cosmology .",
    "the original resolution was reheating  the complete transfer of energy from the inflaton via single - particle decays .",
    "later coherent decays , known as preheating @xcite , were invoked as well .",
    "such decays may be extremely efficient when the inflaton oscillations are large , but if the only interactions present are annihilations , the process will necessarily shut off once the density reduces .",
    "this led kofman , linde , and starobinsky @xcite to propose that the residual field could act as dark matter , but in fact detailed calculations @xcite show the relic abundance is far too high under standard assumptions .",
    "it has usually thus been considered that preheating is followed by a period of reheating leading to complete decay of the inflaton field .",
    "having recognized that an inefficient reheating is a main concern in our unification scenario , the authors in refs .",
    "@xcite suggest that plasma mass effects @xcite could provide the mechanism for an incomplete reheating after inflation .",
    "the idea is that the decay of the inflaton field is kinematically forbidden in part of the reheating phase .",
    "however , the inflaton field is free to decay once it becomes subdominant with respect to the radiation fluid ( see the paragraph after eq .",
    "( 9 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so thermal masses can not be thought of by itself as a mechanism for incomplete reheating .",
    "we can consider three main possibilities for reducing this excess abundance , while leaving a relic level of oscillations capable of acting as cold dark matter .",
    "the first is to modify the shape of the inflaton potential .",
    "however it is easy to show that the required level of post - inflationary oscillations is too small for such a modification to work ; inflation must end long before the field is near enough the minimum to give the right abundance .",
    "this approach is therefore fruitless .",
    "the second possibility is to modify the reheating process so that it leaves a relic abundance level ; this was the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , who chose a phenomenological form for the decay rate intended to correspond to particles which only had annihilation routes rather than decay routes , thus permitting incomplete reduction of the inflaton oscillations .",
    "however fine - tuning of the decay rate , unmotivated by fundamental theory , is required to make this scenario work .    in this paper",
    "we consider a third possibility , which appears more attractive and natural , which is to consider a brief period of inflation at lower energy densities .",
    "such a period , often called _ thermal inflation _",
    "@xcite , was introduced in order to remove possible relic abundance problems left over by the original high - energy inflation period .",
    "this second period would be too short to imprint any new large - scale perturbations , but would reduce the abundance of any relic particles compared to the ultimate radiation background .",
    "an oscillating scalar field would have its density reduced by this mechanism .    for future reference ,",
    "[ f : densities ] shows a schematic of the universe s evolution for our proposed scenario . as we will show , the required reduction , assuming a period of preheating after inflation but no reheating ,",
    "is achieved provided thermal inflation lasts for around 12 @xmath8-foldings .",
    "this is in agreement with the duration already suggested in the literature @xcite .",
    "a schematic of the evolution of the densities throughout the universe s evolution .",
    "one ( blue ) line shows the density of the @xmath0 field , and the other ( black ) line the combined density of all other materials . the latter changes shape depending whether this combined density is dominated by radiation or by the material driving thermal inflation .",
    "we also include a reheating period after thermal inflation .",
    "[ to avoid confusing the diagram , we do not show the emergence of non - relativistic baryons from the relativistic fluid at late times.],width=328 ]",
    "we first revisit the calculation of the dark matter mass - per - photon for our scalar field , which ultimately gives the strongest constraint on the parameters of our model .",
    "let us denote by @xmath9 the time after which the required hot big bang ( hbb ) cosmology is recovered is changed with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was intended to denote the time at which the equality @xmath10 was achieved . ] ; hence , the averaged scalar field energy density will be given by @xmath11 for @xmath12 .",
    "hereafter , all quantities with an asterisk denote values at time @xmath9 .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the scalar field dark matter - mass - per - photon as @xmath13 , and we assume expansion at constant entropy implying that @xmath14 remains constant where @xmath15 is the entropic degrees of freedom , usually very similar to the relativistic degrees of freedom that we denote here by @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , for any time @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the temperature of the universe , as measured from the relativistic particles in thermal equilibrium at time @xmath20 .",
    "( [ eq : phi - dm ] ) contains two free parameters , which are the scalar field @xmath21 and the temperature @xmath22 at the beginning of the hbb ; equivalently , we shall call this the time at the end of reheating .",
    "it is then necessary to predict the aforementioned values and determine whether they can match the observed value of @xmath23 .    in the early universe , there is first a stage of slow - roll inflation , at the end of which the inflaton field value is @xmath24 . then a preheating stage starts in which part of the inflaton energy density is converted into relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "we assume the simplest model of preheating @xcite , in which the inflaton field is coupled to a massless scalar field @xmath25 through the four - legs interaction term @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the typically - considered range for the coupling constant .",
    "the preheating process ends once the inflaton amplitude is of the order @xmath28 , at which point the ratio between relativistic ( @xmath25 and @xmath0 quanta ) and non - relativistic degrees of freedom ( coherent oscillations of @xmath0 ) @xmath29 is of order of a few @xcite .",
    "in such a case , we can not expect a prolonged radiation - dominated era after preheating ; rather , we expect the appearance of a matter - dominated era just a few @xmath8-folds after the end of preheating when the coherent @xmath0 field comes back into domination .",
    "alternative coupling terms in the potential , such as three - leg decay interactions , can lead to a complete decay of the inflaton field @xcite ; that would also happen in cases where the inflaton field is coupled to fermionic fields @xcite .",
    "however , we do not allow such couplings for the inflaton field in our model , for instance by presuming that the @xmath30 symmetry @xmath31 is ( almost ) exact .",
    "the @xmath0 field therefore survives right through to the present ; however if the radiation simply redshifts away as normal its density will be far too low relative to that of @xmath0 by the present .    instead , our proposal is that the subsequent evolution of the universe raises the radiation energy density back above that of the @xmath0 field , so as to re - establish a standard hot big bang evolution .",
    "after the preheating process , the energy density of the universe is composed of relativistic particles and non - relativistic matter represented by the coherent oscillations of the inflaton field .",
    "we now assume that there is a second scalar field , initially part of the relativistic thermal bath , that will drive thermal inflation in a later stage .",
    "this second field , known as the _ flaton _ field , has thermal corrections to its potential which trap it in a false vacuum with energy density denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "a hat will be used henceforth to denote quantities related to the flaton field .    according to the standard picture of thermal inflation @xcite , an inflationary stage starts once the false vacuum energy dominates over the radiation fluid",
    "; this happens once the temperature of the latter is @xmath33 .",
    "thermal inflation then ends once the thermal corrections to the potential are insufficient to oppose the underlying symmetry - breaking ( sb ) potential , so that the thermal inflaton can escape from its false vacuum and undergoes an sb transition .",
    "this happens once the temperature of the universe is below the flaton mass scale , @xmath34 .    in our scenario",
    "the sequence is a little different , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : densities ] , because the flaton density is initially subdominant to the oscillating @xmath0 field .",
    "however after some interval the @xmath0 density falls below it and thermal inflation starts ; sometime afterwards the sb transition then takes place .",
    "after the preheating process the inflaton field redshifts as cold dark matter , @xmath35 , and we can calculate the total dilution of the inflaton field from the end of preheating up to the sb process .",
    "the square of the inflaton field at the end of thermal inflation is given by @xmath36 to obtain the above equation we are assuming both entropy conservation and that the radiation fluid is in thermal equilibrium .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 are the values of the temperature at the end of the preheating stage and at the sb process , respectively ; likewise , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the corresponding values of the scale factor .",
    "once thermal equilibrium is attained at the end of preheating @xcite , the usual formula for the temperature of the radiation fluid applies , @xmath41 . recalling that @xmath42 , then @xmath43 .",
    "may lead to @xcite . ] thus , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi - sb0 ] ) , the total dilution of the inflaton field is largely determined by the mass scales of the inflationary fields , @xmath44    the last process is the reheating of the universe at the end of thermal inflation .",
    "we shall assume that each flaton particle decays at a single - particle decay rate @xmath45 , which is a new free parameter in our phenomenological approach . in principle the value of @xmath45",
    "can be estimated in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath32 @xcite , as we discuss later .",
    "the universe is reheated when @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the hubble rate at the beginning of the hbb . in between",
    ", the universe is dominated by the energy density of the oscillating flaton field ( which redshifts as @xmath49 ) , so that the change in the scale factor is given by @xmath50 the inflaton field is further affected by this expansion as well , so that we get @xmath51 where @xmath52 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi - sb ] ) .",
    "finally , the reheating temperature @xmath22 is estimated to be @xcite @xmath53    we are now in a position to use the dark matter constraint from eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi - dm ] ) , which now takes the form @xmath54    the measured value of the current dark matter mass per photon is @xmath55 using values from wmap5 @xcite .",
    "we shall take that @xmath56 for temperatures @xmath57 , and , where ` @xmath58 ' indicates present values ; eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi - dm-1 ] ) then becomes @xmath59    we define the number of @xmath8-folds of thermal inflation as @xmath60 , whereas we denote the number of @xmath8-folds between the end of thermal inflation and the completion of reheating , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sb - ast ] ) , as @xmath61 thus , an equivalent expression for eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) is , in terms of the above - defined @xmath8-folding numbers , @xmath62 where we have used @xmath63 . for the expected range @xmath27 , the last term on the right - hand side contributes one to two extra @xmath8-folds .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : main-1 ] ) is our main result , giving the duration of thermal inflation and subsequent reheating required to give a viable universal history .",
    "we now investigate how achievable it is .",
    "the only genuinely free parameter of our model is the decay width @xmath45 , which determines @xmath64 ( the dependence on @xmath65 over its expected range is modest ) .",
    "the reason is that thermal inflation parameters are expected to lie in more or less definite ranges of energy @xcite .",
    "the mass of the flaton field should be of the order of @xmath66 to @xmath67 gev , and on general grounds we expect @xmath68 to @xmath69 gev , so that @xmath70 with an uncertainty of one or two in either direction .",
    "this could be increased by having more than one period of thermal inflation , but we do not need this .",
    "the decay width is sandwiched by two limits : that the decay should take place after thermal inflation is complete , @xmath71 , and that it should be complete before the run - up to nucleosynthesis begins at around 10 mev , requiring @xmath72 .",
    "figure  [ f : fig2 ] shows the required value of @xmath45 to satisfy the observational constraint  ( [ eq : main-1 ] ) , as a function of @xmath32 and for some different values of @xmath73 .",
    "we see that the nucleosynthesis constraint can readily be satisfied provided @xmath73 and @xmath32 are large enough , and that suitable values lie well within the expected range .",

    "( [ eq : main-1 ] ) in fig .",
    "[ f : fig2 ] , we find that the favoured flaton parameters are @xmath78 and @xmath81 .    we therefore conclude that thermal inflation , with properties already well established in the literature , can indeed dilute the inflaton density sufficiently that it can act as dark matter .",
    "the task of arranging that a residual inflaton density survives to act as dark matter is a challenging one , but unification of two normally unconnected sectors of cosmological modeling would be a valuable reward ( within the string landscape picture we can even argue that the same potential also gives rise to dark energy @xcite ) . in this paper , we have shown that one option to achieve this is to exploit the uncertainty in cosmological dynamics during the long period from the end of inflation up to nucleosynthesis . in particular , we have found that a period of thermal inflation during this epoch has exactly the desired effect , reducing the residual inflaton density after preheating from a dominant level down to one where the desired late radiation to matter transition can be achieved .",
    "moreover , the amount of thermal inflation needed to achieve this is pretty much the amount already taken as standard in the literature , for completely different reasons .",
    "further , since the thermal inflation scenario comes quite close to failing the nucleosynthesis constraint , it is clear that less drastic modifications to early universe dynamics , such as a protracted period of matter domination due to temporary domination by some long - lived massive particle species , would not be sufficient to achieve our goals .",
    "extra periods of early universe inflation appear essential .",
    "it is of course not so attractive that we have had to invoke a second period of inflation , in order to unify the first type of inflaton with dark matter .",
    "but at least the thermal inflaton is more grounded in conventional particle physics , specifically supersymmetry .",
    "additionally , even conventional high - scale inflation models may too need thermal inflation in order to solve extra relic abundance problems such as the gravitino @xcite .",
    "the scenario that we have described is based around the quadratic potential , but the construction is of course more general and can be applied to a wide range of inflation models . indeed , at least within the context of the string landscape",
    ", the quadratic potential is actually quite unattractive as its form has to hold over field values many times greater than the ( reduced ) planck mass , which is the scale on which we expect the potential to have features @xcite",
    ". it may be much more plausible to consider inflation as occurring near a hilltop @xcite between neighbouring minima in the landscape ; we anticipate the calculation going through more or less as in this paper , but perhaps different in the fine numerical details ( for instance , eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) depends on the inflaton mass , whose value depends on the shape of the potential during inflation ) .    another reason to consider different potentials is that thermal inflation significantly reduces the number of inflationary @xmath8-folds corresponding to the present horizon , perhaps to 40 rather than the usual 50 to 60 @xcite .",
    "this forces the predictions for the observables @xmath82 and @xmath83 further from the slow - roll limit @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and wmap5 is starting to exert significant observational pressure against the quadratic potential for low @xmath8-folding numbers @xcite .",
    "while this is not yet conclusive , it certainly motivates study of potentials which can produce smaller values of @xmath83 .",
