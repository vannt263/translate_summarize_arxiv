    "we investigate a procedure to cut open a polyhedron along its edges and unfold it to a connected flat piece without overlap . the unfolding needs to consist of the faces of the polyhedron joined along the edges .",
    "this type of unfolding has been referred to as _ edge unfolding _ or simply _ unfolding_. it is known that some non - convex polyhedra have no edge unfoldings .",
    "however , no example of a convex polyhedron that has no edge unfolding is known . the determination of whether every convex polyhedron has an edge unfolding is a long - standing open problem .",
    "the difficulty of this question led to the exploration of other unfoldings that have a broader definition of edge unfolding .",
    "we pay attention to a _",

    "their algorithm @xcite first finds a spanning path from triangle to triangle on the surface of the polyhedron , connecting through common vertices , and further , lays out the triangles along a line without overlap .",
    "their method is based on the condition that all faces are triangular , and the existences of the face path and the line - layout of it might actually fail for a polyhedron with non - triangular faces .",
    "for example , the truncated cube has no face path since its six octagons are inadequate to lay out eight triangles along a line , and if a face path consists of isosceles trapezoids , a local overlap might occur in a long strip .    in this paper",

    "polyhedron @xmath0 is _ tight _ if no two non - triangular faces share a vertex .",
    "examples of tight polyhedra are the snub cube , snub dodecahedron , pyramids , and antiprisms .",

    "we will describe it in sections [ sec : hamiltonian vertex - face tour]-[sec : arrangement of the faces ] .",
    "our new result is a graph theoretical part of it , which is contained in section [ sec : hamiltonian vertex - face tour ] .",
