    "since the fundamental work on random graphs by erds and rnyi @xcite , especially the seminal works on the small - world phenomenon by watts and strogatz @xcite and the scale - free property by barabsi and albert @xcite , the study of complex networks has received extensive attention .",
    "scientists have found that most real networks are neither completely regular nor completely random , but usually display a small - world effect and/or a scale - free behavior @xcite .",
    "the research results show that complex network theory has been proven to be a powerful tool for the analysis in various fields , such as the world wide web @xcite , social networks @xcite , ecological systems @xcite , traffic systems @xcite , and so on .    in biological systems , elements that interact or regulate each other",
    "can be represented by a network , namely , a collection of nodes and edges ( links ) @xcite . at the simplest level",
    ", the individual elements are described as nodes and their interactions are reduced to edges connecting between pairs of nodes . here , the network - based approach is an effective way to discover the collective action of the individual parts , namely , the systems - level behavior @xcite , which has been widely used in biochemical and medical research and offers a conceptual framework to understand molecular mechanisms and disease pathologies .",
    "hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality ; the worldwide prevalence of hypertension is @xmath1 @xcite . over the years",
    ", a great deal of research shows that the arterial blood pressure of many essential hypertensive patients exhibits an increased sensitivity to dietary salt intake , which is known as the salt - sensitive ( ss ) hypertension @xcite .",
    "these people account for about @xmath2 of hypertensive patients @xcite .",
    "therefore , the studies about ss hypertension contribute to a decrease in the level of blood pressure and in the incidence of mortality due to cardiovascular complications , and thus improve human health @xcite .",
    "existing research for the dahl ss rat @xcite and consomic rat strains @xcite reveals that salt and genetic factors have a major impact on hypertension @xcite . during the last 30 years or so ,",
    "the clinical research and treatment of hypertension have improved dramatically @xcite .",
    "however , its molecular mechanisms and pathologies involved remain intricate and elusive .    in the present work",
    ", we attempt to study the genes that are involved in ss hypertension using the complex network approach",
    ". we will propose a simple rule to construct the network model of hypertension - related genes , where the nodes are individual genes and the connections are derived from the expression correlations that are based on microarray data . through calculating several statistical indices and analyzing topological characteristics of the network ,",
    "we find out key hub genes that play significant roles in hypertension and describe their functions .",
    "based on both biological knowledge and network theory , this study confirms the role of key genes in hypertension from another perspective and provides an idea for studying the relation between genes associated with hypertension .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we introduce the construction of the network model of hypertension - related genes . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    ", we analyze the statistical and topological characteristics of the gene network , and determine key hub genes by introducing an integrated centrality .",
    "the biological descriptions of hub genes are presented in section [ sec:4 ] , while section [ sec:5 ] gives concluding remarks .",
    "the dahl ss rat is a widely used genetic model of human hypertension , which was proposed by dahl et al . in the early 1960s",
    "@xcite . it develops hypertension upon exposure to a high - salt intake .",
    "the consomic rat strains , used as the normotensive control for the dahl ss rat , are generated by substituting a chromosome or a part of a chromosome from a normal rat strain for the corresponding genomic region of the ss rat @xcite .",
    "previous research showed that substitution of chromosome 13 or 18 could significantly attenuate hypertension @xcite .",
    "the two consomic rat strains ( generated by substituting chromosomes 13 and 18 , respectively ) have genetic homology with the dahl ss rat , but lead to the amelioration of hypertension ; and the segregation of hypertensive phenotype is regarded as the result of different gene expression patterns among the three rat strains caused by substituting chromosomes . therefore , our study focuses on the analysis of gene expression data ( ged ) among the dahl ss rat and two consomic rat strains : @xmath3 ( ged for ss rat with high blood pressure ) , @xmath4 ( ged for substitution of chromosome 13 ) and @xmath5 ( ged for substitution of chromosome 18 ) , where all three strains of rats were maintained on a high sodium intake for two weeks and gene expression profiles were examined using microarrays ( see http://pga.mcw.edu ) .",
    "all data of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are given in three columns ( ss2wk , ss13 2wk , and ss18 2wk ) in table s2 of supplemental figures and tables of ref .",
    "@xcite . in table [ dataformat ] we list detailed data of some randomly selected genes and feature genes calculated in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "let us consider the network @xmath6 , where @xmath7 @xmath8 is the set of @xmath9 nodes , and @xmath10 the set of edges or connections between nodes .",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath11 indicates that there is an edge between nodes @xmath12 and @xmath13 ; and @xmath14 otherwise .",
    "our gene network model is constructed from the correlations based on ged in three rat strains in two steps , which is designed to explore the relationship between genetic change trend and hypertensive phenotype .",
    "calculation of change ratios of ged : _",
    "the @xmath15 hypertension - related genes are served as nodes of the network , each node represents an individual gene shown as gene symbol or cloneid ( for the gene without a gene symbol ) . for each of the @xmath16 nodes",
    ", we define the change ratios @xmath17 and @xmath18 of ged between @xmath19 and @xmath20 as follows : @xmath21 where @xmath22",
    ". then we can calculate the change ratios @xmath17 and @xmath18 separately ( these data are shown as @xmath23 and @xmath24 in table [ dataformat ] ) .",
    "it is easy to obtain the averages of two groups of change ratios @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively : @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ; which can be used as thresholds to determine whether a connection should be made between two nodes in the next step .",
    "it should be indicated that there are many ways of choosing the threshold , a higher threshold would result in a higher average degree and a greater influence or disturbance among nodes ( genes ) , whereas a lower threshold would result in fewer connections but a greater possibility of the actual correlation of genes .",
    "so the average change ratio would be a reasonable choice of the threshold to make reliable connections and a moderate scale of the network .",
    "indeed , setting the threshold a little higher or lower than the average would not disturb the clustered ( not paired ) relationship of genes considered in this paper .",

    "since our network model is constructed by considering the correlations of ged , hub genes which have similar expression patterns with most of the genes with changed expression levels are typical representatives of the genes with strong correlation . from relevant research literature and the biological functions of these hub genes shown in table [ genefunction ] , we know that these hub genes are key ( feature ) genes that play important roles in hypertension .",
    "this shows that our construction of the gene network is suitable .",
    "hypertension has the complexity and diversity of the genetic factors and pathogenesis . however , a comprehensive understanding of hypertension is still extremely deficient . in this study , based on microarray data ,",
    "we attempt to reversely obtain the relationships between the hypertension - related genes , rebuild the structure of the gene network by visualization technology , and try to abstract the complex interactions between genes through calculating statistical characteristics of the gene network .",
    "the network of hypertension - related genes is sparse , which has the following characteristics : ( 1 ) the gene network shows a scale - free property with power - law degree distribution . a few nodes with large values of three centrality indices @xmath31 ( or equivalently with large values of integrated centrality @xmath32 ) correspond to hub genes ; they are key ( feature ) genes involved in the formation of hypertension .",
    "( 2 ) the gene network has a small average path length ( @xmath33 ) and a large clustering coefficient ( @xmath34 ) , i.e. , the small - world property , indicating that the local disturbance to hubs would rapidly transfer to the whole network .",
    "this property reveals the direct influence of these hub genes on hypertension from another perspective , and implies possible novel molecular genetic signals .",
    "( 3 ) the gene network of hypertension is a description of an abnormal state ( illness ) , which exhibits assortative feature ( assortativity coefficient @xmath35 ) unlike most biological networks .",
    "the nodes with many connections tend to be connected to those with the similar type , showing that besides being affected by a few feature genes , hypertension is the consequence of accumulation of genetic changes and interaction caused by a variety of factors ; this has been demonstrated by the existing research findings .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to focus on further study of the interplay between genes in biological experiments .    in this paper , we construct the network model of hypertension - related genes in genetic level based on both biological knowledge and network theory .",
    "the hub genes ( _ col4a1 _ , _ lcn2 _ , _ cdk4 _ , etc . ) in our network have been confirmed by biological / medical research to play important roles in hypertension .",
    "furthermore , the network can also be analyzed based on actual functional correlation metrics with other threshold selection methods ( e.g. , @xcite ) to get more biological information about hypertension in the future ; it is believable that the results derived from those methods would be consistent and harmonic in comparison with the theoretical analysis of this paper , and they would complement each other .",
    "this study provides another perspective on expounding the molecular genetic mechanism , prevention , and individualization treatment of salt - sensitive hypertension .",
    "meanwhile , the research may hopefully shed light on the development of network - based models ( e.g. , directed and/or weighted networks ) of hypertension and other serious diseases , and explore the mutual regulatory relationships between genes of complex diseases , as well as contribute to finding new drug targets and developing novel ideas .",
    "at last , we expect that the complex network approach can provide an effective tool for analyzing the pathogenesis of critical illness .",
