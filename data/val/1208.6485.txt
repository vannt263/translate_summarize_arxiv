    "issue regarding black hole ( bh ) quantization problem has been intensively and extensively focused on .",
    "as early as the 1970s , bekenstein conjectured that if the horizon area is an adiabatic invariant , the horizon area should have a discrete and equally spaced spectrum @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath6 is the planck length .",
    "the gravitational units of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are adopted .",
    "it shows that any classical adiabatic invariant should be corresponded to a quantum entity with discrete spectrum according to the ehrenfest principle .",
    "after that , many people have obtained the spectrums for various dynamical modes with various parameter @xmath5 including @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite .    since the quantization of bh is put forth , people find that the quasinormal modes ( qnms ) has a very important place in loop quantum gravity .",
    "hod firstly observed that the spacing parameter @xmath5 could be determined by the high overtones quasinormal ( qn ) frequencies @xcite .",
    "subsequently , kunstatter suggested that the system adiabatic invariant should have a form of @xmath11 in which @xmath12 is system energy and @xmath13 is vibrational frequency @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that if we choose the real part of qn frequencies @xmath14 and the adm mass @xmath15 as the vibrational frequency @xmath13 and the system energy @xmath12 , hod s result @xmath16 is obtained naturally through kunstatter method .",
    "recently , maggiore considers above situations and proposes that the qn frequencies should be treated as the proper frequency of the equivalent harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "the change of the mass of bh @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is identified with the change between adjacent physical frequencies ( @xmath20 ) where @xmath21 is overtones number .",
    "according to the harmonic oscillator theory , the actual frequency is @xmath22 , rather than original @xmath14 . for the highly damping limit @xmath23 ,",
    "one has a proper frequency @xmath24 .",
    "although the usual qnms are important for observational aspect of gravitational waves phenomena , the high overtones qnms are typically ignored because these relevant modes damped infinitely fast do not significantly contribute to the gravitational wave signal .",
    "however , since hod opens a new era connecting bh quantization and qnms , the highly damped qnms ( @xmath25 ) has been attracted more attentions .",
    "motl subsequently presents these asymptotic qnms in ref.@xcite by continued fractions methods assuming the gauge group of the theory to be so(3 ) @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath26 the numerical method becomes more hard to solve .",
    "hence , motl - neitzke developed the monodromy method by matching several poles in the plane which can calculate the highly damped qn frequencies for any static spacetime in principle @xcite .    on the other hands of this paper , more astronomical observations @xcite",
    "demonstrate us a nonzero cosmological constant for the expanded universe whose topology structure presents more like a de sitter case ( for the review see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "schwarzschild de sitter ( sds ) spacetime becomes more and more important in the gravity theory .",
    "recently , more attentions are paid on the near extremal sds bh in which the bh event horizon and the cosmological horizon are close to each other @xcite . in 2003",
    "@xcite , cardoso - lemos obtained their qn frequencies for various radiative fields including scalar perturbation , electromagnetic perturbation and gravitational perturbation by using p@xmath27shl - teller potential with very large imaginary part @xcite .",
    "then this result @xcite has been used to quantize the area and entropy of the near extremal sds bh @xcite . in early setare s work",
    "@xcite , the real part of qn frequencies is considered to be a fundamental vibrational frequency for a bh of energy .",
    "the area spectrum of near extremal case above is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is dependent on the form of perturbations : namely @xmath30 for scalar or electromagnetic perturbations , @xmath31 for gravitational perturbation . in the recent work @xcite , li - xu - lu ( lxl )",
    "have used maggiore s physical interpretation of quasinormal modes and restudied this near extremal case .",
    "they found the area spectrum is @xmath32 and the entropy spectrum is @xmath33 which are independent of the form of perturbations . comparing the near extremal case @xcite with other systems @xcite",
    ", one will find it is similar to the single horizon bh because the inner horizon and outer horizon are degenerate into a extremal single horizon case , similar to schwarzschild case .",
    "so under the same maggiore s interpretation , the result of ref.@xcite is in agreement with the results of schwarzschild bh @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we known there is no work relevant to the quantization for the more general sds spacetime with non extremal cosmological constant .",
    "so based on above situations including maggiore s interpretation and highly damped qnms of sds bh , we use kunstatter method to calculate the spectrums of area and entropy for sds bh .",
    "the static spherically symmetric metric of sds bh is given by @xmath34 where lapse function is @xmath35 @xmath15 is bh mass and @xmath36 is de sitter curvature radius .",
    "the spacetime above is bounded by two horizons , namely , inner event horizon @xmath37 and outer cosmological horizon @xmath38 , which are listed as followings , @xmath39 where @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "the real solutions are accepted only if @xmath42 satisfies @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the lapse function ( [ 2metricfunction ] ) , hereby , could be rewritten as , @xmath44 where the negative parameter @xmath45 has no physical meaning .    matching eqs.([2metricfunction ] ) and ( [ 23metricfunc ] ) , we can get the relationships of bh mass @xmath15 and de sitter curvature radius @xmath46 as @xmath47 according to the variations of eqs.([ldss ] ) and ( [ mlds ] ) , we have the formulas with respect to @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 as , @xmath51    then , we need introduce the surface gravity @xmath52 and the tortoise coordinate @xmath53 in the following words . according to the definition of surface gravity @xmath54 one can easily obtain its explicit forms @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the surface gravity at @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . submitting eqs.([sur1 ] ) and ( [ sufacecc ] ) into eq.([deltamhorizons ] ) , we can find the relationship between @xmath48 and @xmath49 @xmath58 here  @xmath59 \" denotes the inverse relation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which indicates when bh mass @xmath15 increases ( @xmath60 ) , @xmath37 increases ( @xmath61 ) , but @xmath38 decreases ( @xmath62 ) . here , it is convenient to use eqs.([deltamhorizons ] ) and ( [ adddeltarecre ] ) to calculate the spectrums of area and entropy .    through the definition of tortoise",
    "coordinate shown by @xmath63 we can get @xmath64}.\\label{tor - grav - sf}\\ ] ]    by using above coordinate eq.([tor - grav - sf ] ) the perturbation field equation of @xmath65 could be reduced to a form of schrdinger wave - like equation as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the radial component and @xmath68 is potential given by @xmath69 which dominates the evolution of field in sds spacetime .",
    "one of outstanding characteristics of this potential is that when @xmath53 approaches two horizons , the potential @xmath70 goes exponentially to zero .",
    "based on the potential ( [ kkr ] ) , various qnms could be solved out by adding some special boundary conditions @xcite . in the early studies on the aspect of perturbation",
    "focus mainly on the dynamics of radiative field such as two - dimensional toy models @xcite , radiative three time evolution epochs @xcite , radiative tails @xcite , degenerate special nariai bh @xcite and so on . in order to calculate the spectrums of area and entropy",
    ", the highly damped qnms must be found from them .",
    "fortunately , there is an available case could be used for the computation of these spectrums , namely the high overtone case which is observed not only by konoplya - zhidenko s numerical observations in ref.@xcite , but also by cardoso - nat@xmath71rio - schiappa s theoretical analysis in ref.@xcite as well as choudhury - padmanabhan s work in ref.@xcite .",
    "the accurate high overtones numerical quasinormal modes have been obtained by konoplya - zhidenko ( kz ) in ref.@xcite by using leaver approach @xcite and nollert s @xcite techniques . one interesting phenomenon from these results is that the average value of spacing over sufficiently large number of modes equals event horizon surface gravity @xmath72 , which could be expressed mathematically as @xmath73 this result is in agreement with the analytical results presented by cardoso - nat@xmath71rio - schiappa in ref.@xcite .",
    "simultaneously , choudhury - padmanabhan @xcite also study the corresponding analytic analysis of level spacing of the qnm frequencies and provide a derivation of the imaginary parts of frequencies for the sds spacetime by calculating the scattering amplitude in the first born approximation .",
    "it is found that the numerical observations and theoretical analysis all strongly indicate the spacing of high overtone s imaginary part is proportional to the surface gravity of inner event horizon , rather than the surface gravity of the cosmological horizon in the view of actual physics .",
    "certainly , the situation  scattering off the cosmological horizon \" can happen in mathematics , which can be found in the part of appendix c in ref.@xcite . here",
    ", we do not consider it .",
    "for a given system with energy @xmath12 , kunstatter proposes the adiabatic invariant quantity @xmath74 should have a integral of vibrational frequency @xmath75 as @xcite @xmath76 where we adopt @xmath77 according to the first law of bh thermodynamics .",
    "apparently , how to choose the frequency @xmath78 becomes the key to calculate the spectrums . in hod s early work @xcite , the transition frequencies equal the classical oscillation frequencies for large quantum numbers according to bohr s correspondence principle .",
    "the highly damped bh oscillations frequencies have a very large imaginary part for @xmath79 .",
    "it indicates the effective relaxation time for bh returning to static state is arbitrarily small .",
    "the degraded rapidly qnms should be treated as one type of quantum transition in which the transition frequency is the real part of @xmath78 in a natural way .",
    "however , according to maggiore s interpretation of qnms @xcite , the black hole perturbations should be looked as the damped harmonic vibration . as a result ,",
    "the real frequencies of the equivalent damped harmonic oscillators are @xmath80 rather than @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the real part and @xmath81 is the image part of @xmath78 . for the long lived modes @xmath82 , the real frequencies become @xmath83 .",
    "contrary to long lived case , the frequencies become @xmath84 for the highly excited modes @xmath85 .",
    "then , we consider the transition from @xmath21 mode to @xmath86 mode for a non - extremal cosmological constant . thus according to the numerical observations ( [ singlearea ] )",

    "the charge of black hole does not affect the quantization progress of black hole under de sitter space - time . in spite of",
    "that we still need to finish the quantization of black hole contained charge in de sitter space - time .",
    "then , we need to find the quasinormal frequencies which could be used calculate the area spectrums . just like the words said by ref.@xcite , it is usually difficult to calculate the analytic expressions for the quasinormal frequencies , except in particular situations . here , we must face one difficulty of that there are not clear analytic expressions about rnds black hole quasinormal frequencies , except the near extreme limit case @xcite .",

    "it is highly necessary to investigate the area and entropy spectrums for non - asymptotically flat sds bh with double horizons .",
    "hence , we perform our calculation through konoplys - zhidenko s result @xcite .    \\2",
    ". the spectrums of area and entropy are obtained by using konoplys and zhidenko s qnms @xcite .",
    "the sum formula eq.([singlearea ] ) reveals the statistic treatment on the average high overtone number @xmath21 . for the gravitational perturbations case ,",

    "@xmath21 should be changed to @xmath158 ) .",
    "but , the average value of these spacing over very large number of modes equals to the surface gravity at cosmological horizon @xmath72 .",

    "<S> motivated by recent physical interpretation on quasinormal modes presented by maggiore@xcite , the adiabatic quantity method given by kunstatter@xcite is used to calculate the spectrums of a non - extremal schwarzschild de sitter black hole in this paper , as well as electrically charged case . according to highly damped konoplya and zhidenko s numerical observational results for high overtone modes@xcite , we found that the asymptotic non - flat spacetime structure leads two interesting facts as followings : ( i ) near inner event horizon , the area and entropy spectrums , which are given by @xmath0 , @xmath1 , are equally spaced accurately . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) however , near outer cosmological horizon the spectrums , which are in the form of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , are not markedly equidistant . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we also discuss the electrically charged case and find the black holes in de sitter spacetime have similar quantization behavior no matter with or without charge . </S>"
