    "has been kept at 30  minutes to show long - time evolution of the growth ambient .",
    "a change of relative content is caused by different pumping rate ( e.g. slow hydrogen pumping ) , outgassing from vacuum chamber walls ( mainly water ) and chemical reactions .",
    "we have identified that oxidizing reactions appear at every temperature rise ( from step ( i. ) to ( ii . ) and from step ( ii . ) to ( iii . ) ) resulting in reduced both relative and absolute amount of oxygen .",
    "these reactions are however negligible for very small content of oxygen in the chamber .",
    "the major identified reaction is a reaction of two major components in the furnace , carbon and water .",
    "we discuss this process in detail here .",
    "the epitaxial graphene can be grown fast ( 2 - 5 minutes ) at higher temperatures or slowly ( 20 - 90 minutes ) at lower temperatures .",

    "the step rise of ion current is expected instead due to the step rise of temperature and consequent step rise of mean velocity of ions .",
    "the lack of such ion step rise of water can be attributed to the reduction of total amount of water in the chamber .",
    "the rise of m / z=28 by 8@xmath23  a is attributed to co. the rise of co is confirmed by rise of ion current at m / z=12 by 0.25@xmath23  a , which is 3% ( expected co contribution is 5% ) of the major ion current rise at m / z=28 .",
    "the minor ion current peak at m / z=14 by 0.05@xmath23  a ( 0.6% of m / z=28 , expected co contribution is 1% ) is also attributed to co. we conclude that there is no absolute change of nitrogen ( m / z=28 , 14 ) and all content changes can be explained by increasing amount of co and similar amount of hydrogen .",
    "the shift of hydrogen peak towards longer times is caused by slower pumping of hydrogen than pumping of co , water and other heavier ions .",
    "the ion current rise at mass m / z=44 by 0.6@xmath23  a is due to the carbon dioxide ( co@xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore the dynamics of growth ambient is dominated by chemical reaction @xmath24 the major chemical reaction given by equation  ( [ eqreaction ] ) is observed mainly on the short time scale below 30  s after each temperature step rise .",
    "the time scale between 30 - 100  s is dominated by pumping the products of eq .",
    "( [ eqreaction ] ) out of the furnace .",
    "the long time scale above 2  minutes is dominated by both pumping of the residual gas and water outgassing from the stainless steel furnace walls .",
    "this behavior has been observed both in high vacuum and low pressure argon and also in the case of glassy graphite crucible in high vacuum , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmcd ] .",
    "the content changes only slowly for longer times ( @xmath2560  s ) , however , water becomes slowly dominant gas .",
    "the water source is at the surface of stainless steel furnace walls .",
    "the main issue is that it can promote reaction with carbon ( [ eqreaction ] ) even further , hence creating defects in a graphene layer .",
    "therefore it is more preferential to grow graphene at higher temperatures for shorter times .",
    "as the residual gas analysis has shown preferable shorter growth times and higher temperatures , we grow single layer graphene between 1500 - 1550@xmath10c for 5  minutes in high vacuum @xmath9-@xmath26  mbar .",
    "the 1500@xmath10c/5  minutes growth seems to result in a patchy graphene with about 20 - 40% of buffer layer .",

    "the growth has been always done in the same graphite crucible with a hole 1  mm in diameter and 10  mm long .",
    "argon acting on graphene growth is twofold .",
    "first , it is equivalent to ccg method , where the lowered silicon sublimation is due to the small volume in nearly closed graphite crucible .",
    "second , argon pressure acts as an inhibitor for water outgassing , as has been discussed in previous paragraphs as the major source of residual gas and potential cause of defects formation in epitaxial graphene .",
    "we note , that high purity argon is necessary in order to obtain overall purity of growth conditions comparable to those in high vacuum at @xmath27  mbar .",
    "an equivalent purity of argon gas for graphene growth at 1000  mbar is 8n ( = 1000  mbar/10@xmath28  mbar ) . a lower argon purity results in higher relative content of residual gas , which leads to higher total amount of mainly water at 1000  mbar argon pressure growth ( the total amount of water is discussed with respect to the total amount of water at high vacuum ( 10@xmath28  mbar ) growth ) .",
    "beside the gas purity , also the background outgassing in the furnace has to be taken into account .",
    "a typical water backround pressure in unbaked furnace is 10@xmath29  mbar-10@xmath28  mbar .",
    "if the background water pressure is higher , the overal argon purity in the furnace will be lower even with gas purifiers , as is described in fig .",

    ". the total gas purity can not be higher than the inlet gas purity , therefore all curves saturate at the value of inlet gas purity 9n ( solid lines ) and 6n ( dashed lines ) . fig .",
    "[ figpurity ] also shows influence of four different background impurity pressures .",
    "the background impurity pressure is detrimental at low total argon pressures , therefore it is expected that higher quality graphene will be grown at higher argon pressures , as has been evidenced in literature  @xcite .",
    "a further reduction of water outgassing could be done by growth in argon flow .",
    "the graphene quality should be independent on the flow rate as long as the flow rate is much higher than outgassing rate .",

    "the results of raman scattering and hall effect measurements lead us to conclusion that graphene grown in ultra - pure argon at 800  mbar is of higher quality than graphene grown in high vacuum .",
    "the growth in high vacuum leads to smaller graphene grain size below 1  @xmath4 m even if the growth conditions are well optimized by high temperature bakeout of graphite crucible , gas inlet pipes to vent the furnace and the furnace itself .",
    "the key isssue in graphene growth is a presence of water and water outgassing from stainless steel surfaces .",
    "we have observed chemical reaction of water and solid state carbon in all stages of graphene growth .",
    "this reaction is important within first one minute of each graphene growth step .",
    "it becomes important again when graphene is grown for longer times above 20 - 30  minutes .",
    "this is caused by gradual furnace warm up and consequent water outgassing from previously colder furnace parts .",
    "even though it would be thermodynamicaly more preferable to grow graphene slowly , providing high crystal quality , the water outgassing acts against long growth times . as we do not know the origin of carbon , we assume that the main source is a graphite crucible for a time scale below 60  s at the beginning of each growth step . however",
    ", as graphene grows , the carbon source can be also graphene itself .",
    "this reaction of water and carbon from partially formed graphene will be a cause of higher defect density and smaller grain size , as we have observed in raman spectra analysis .",
    "a disadvantage of short growth time is that there is no temporally stable growth atmosphere content .",
    "moreover , it differs slightly from one sample to another .",
    "the hydrogen produced in a reaction of carbon and water can also cause sic etching or it can react with carbon , increasing defect density in graphene even more .",
    "hydrogen is therefore undesired gas during graphene growth .",
    "the growth in argon has been shown to lead to more stable growth atmosphere content with small rate of carbon and water reaction and also smaller amount of hydrogen .",
    "the high argon pressure reduces both water outgassing and also mean free path of water molecules .",
    "the shorter mean free path can be used to restrict water transport towards grown graphene when growth is performed in argon flow .",
    "we also point out that it is essential to use ultra - pure argon ( 8 or 9n ) at the furnace inlet . a common 6n argon at 1000  mbar is in terms of total amount of residual gas equivalent to vacuum growth at @xmath103  mbar ( if background outgassing causes lower or equal pressure ) .",
    "therefore , growth in 6n argon at 1000  mbar will lead to much worse graphene than the one grown in hv at @xmath22-@xmath21  mbar .",
    "the argon flow rate is not supposed to improve the overall amount of residual gas because this residual gas in homogeneously spread within the furnace volume .",
    "contrary to that , the 9n argon at 1000  mbar is equivalent to hv at @xmath22  mbar in terms of total amount of residual gas .",
    "these two growth conditions are initially equivalent . however",
    ", the growth conditions are more preferable for argon growth at the later stages of graphene growth for two reasons .",
    "first , water outgasses in hv and causes graphene degradation ( pressure rises to 10@xmath28  mbar ) .",
    "water ougassing is strongly reduced in high pressure argon , therefore the total amount of impurities remains nearly constant .",
    "second , any possible residual gas in ultra pure argon can be removed by growth in argon flow .",
    "the argon flow should be only higher than the outgassing rate .",
    "air permeability of graphite brings constrictions on a crucible storage .",
    "the nitrogen and water is absorbed into the crucible after longer exposure to air .",
    "it is therefore suggested to store isp graphite in vacuum or inert gas .",
    "glassy graphite is impermeable to air components , however , the surface absorbants still lead to higher desorption when glassy graphite crucible is heated to growth temperatures .",
    "raman spectroscopy has proven to be a versatile tool to determine most of basic graphene properties as mechanical strain , charge density , graphene grain size , number of graphene layers or even to estimate electrostatic potential fluctuations and carrier mobility .",
    "we have measured graphene raman spectra using several microscope objetives with different magnification and numerical apertures .",
    "we point out that although relative strength of sic raman spectrum and intensity of graphene spectrum ( particularly intensity of g peak ) have been used to determine number of graphene layers by some authors  @xcite , this method can be only calibrated ( intensity ratio to the number of layers ) to a given experimental set up and it is not transferable .",
    "the reason is mainly due to the different microscope objective numerical apertures ( na ) .",
    "the smaller the apperture is the longer the rayleigh length .",
    "it causes that small na objective probes signal deeper from bulk crystal , even if it is focused properly on a surface graphene layer . as a result ,",
    "relative intensity of graphene to sic bulk spectrum will be smaller than the ratio determined from raman spectra measured with high - na objective .",
    "a similar issue comes up in a grain size determination from the ratio of d to g peak intensity . if low - na objective is used , graphene signal is weak realitively to sic signal and the d peak can seem to be negligible with respect to sic  @xcite .",
    "the small d peak is then mistakenly identified as a signature of high quality graphene .",
    "hall effect measurements have been used to quantify graphene electronic quality .",
    "the apparent carrier mobilites are almost twice higher in argon grown graphene .",
    "the analysis of transport measurements has been done also within a model of electron hole puddles .",
    "this model is in agreement with our raman scattering analysis which has indicated very low charge density below 1.5  @xmath110@xmath51  @xmath52 .",
    "the carrier mobility is twice higher for argon grown graphene within the model of electron hole puddles , too .",
    "we have analyzed experimentally graphene growth environment and its influence on graphene quality .",
