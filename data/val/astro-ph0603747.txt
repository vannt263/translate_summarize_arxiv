    "the study of low mass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs yields useful information regarding the initial mass function near the bottom of the main sequence and below , the overall binary fraction of intermediate mass stars , and the long term stability and survivability of low mass objects in orbit about post - asymptotic giant branch stars @xcite . of particular interest is common envelope evolution and its consequences for any low mass companion .",
    "understanding how low mass , unevolved companions fare inside and outside a common envelope is an easier task than distentangling binaries which have experienced two envelopes , such as double degenerates , and should provide insight into more complex binary evolution .",
    "this paper presents the first results from a _ hst _ advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) imaging survey of 90 candidate white dwarf + red dwarf binaries .",
    "the goals of the study are to empirically test the bimodal distribution of orbital semimajor axes predicted by post - asymptotic giant branch binary evolution models , and to examine the distribution of companion masses as a function of current separation @xcite .",
    "the prime focus of the present study is to image white dwarf + red dwarf pairs with sufficient spatial resolution to directly probe the @xmath0 au range .",
    "specifically , models of orbital expanion due to adiabatic mass loss , combined with models of frictional inspiral within a circumbinary envelope , predict a gap between diminished ( @xmath1 au , @xmath2 yr ) and augmented ( @xmath3 au , @xmath4 yr ) orbits for low mass , unevolved companions to white dwarfs . a crude model of the expected distribution",
    "is given in @xcite ; basically , companions originally within @xmath5 au are brought inward of 0.1 au , while those formerly outside this radius migrate farther by a factor of 3 .",
    "the selected program stars , taken from and described in @xcite , are almost exclusively white dwarfs in @xcite which were found by @xcite to exhibit excess near - infrared emission in the 2mass point source catalog @xcite .",
    "several additional targets of a similar nature were taken from @xcite .",
    "white dwarfs with measured near - infrared flux above the photospheric contribution are strong candidates for harboring cool , low mass companions .",
    "with radii of @xmath6 @xmath7 , low mass stellar and substellar companions to white dwarfs ( @xmath6 @xmath8 ) can easily dominate the spectral energy distribution of the binary at red to near - infrared wavelengths , despite their low luminosities and low effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "the target list for the white dwarfs discussed in this paper is given in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the present data were taken with the acs @xcite high resolution channel ( hrc ) aboard _",
    "hst_. the observations at each target consisted of a small 4-point dither pattern with the f814w ( approximately @xmath9 band ) filter to such a depth as to reach signal - to - noise ( s / n ) @xmath10 on both the white dwarf and its suspected red dwarf companion .",
    "these dithered frames were processed with multidrizzle to create a single combined , cosmic ray free image on which to perform astrometry and photometry .",
    "each reduced image was visually inspected , and if two or more components were seen separated by @xmath11 , or if the candidate binary appeared to be a single unresolved point source , the analysis was as follows . for these single or well resolved multiple point sources , astrometry and aperture photometry",
    "were performed with standard iraf tasks .",
    "a few astrometric tasks were carried out with idp3 , which has the ability to determine the length and orientation of the major and minor axes in a gaussian profile fit .",
    "both centroid and radial profile fits were executed for each star to determine its coordinates on the chip and to measure the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , as well as eccentricity .",
    "radial profiles were fit using a @xmath12 ( 3 pixel ) radius , while photometry was carried out with a @xmath13 ( 5 pixel ) aperture radius .",
    "corrections to the standard acs aperture , as well as appropriate sky annuli values , and color corrections , were taken from @xcite .",
    "counts were converted into flux , then into vega magnitudes , and finally into cousins @xmath9 band magnitudes , all following the methods and calibrations of @xcite .    if a binary appeared resolved but with point - spread functions ( psfs ) separated by @xmath14 , then a different approach was used . in order to perform astrometry and photometry on these components with overlapping psfs , it was first necessary to remove the nearby companion flux individually for each star .",
    "for this purpose , tinytim was used to generate acs psfs which were then processed with multidrizzle .",
    "these multidrizzled psfs were interpolated , scaled , and subtracted in turn from each star of the binary systems to isolate one star at a time .",
    "each binary component was then examined in the same manner as for single sources and resolved components as described above . however , after companion removal there were often residuals still contaminating aperture photometry out to @xmath15 pixels . for these close binary components ,",
    "an aperture of @xmath16 pixels was used and the measured flux was corrected to @xmath15 pixels using aperture corrections derived from all well - separated single point source science targets in the data set .",
    "psf subtraction was performed in the manner described above for all science target point sources to search for faint , close companions . in a typical psf subtracted image ,",
    "the residuals contain some small structure which is likely attributable to imperfections in the artificial , multidrizzled psfs .",
    "although the residuals were typically @xmath17% of the peak flux , this still might obscure any close companions at @xmath18 magnitudes .",
    "there is an ongoing effort to improve the psf subtractions by : 1 ) performing the subtractions on the calibrated , flat fielded images and then multidrizzling the resultant images or ; 2 ) using real acs multidrizzled psfs rather than artificial ones .",
    "table [ tbl1 ] lists all astrometry and photometry results for the 48 targets analyzed so far in the program .",
    "the table is organized so that the first line for a given target provides data on the white dwarf and subsequent lines are the companion data .",
    "the first column lists the white dwarf number from @xcite , and the second column lists an alternate name for the white dwarf or the companion name .",
    "the third column contains `` yes '' if the components are totally or partially resolved in the acs observation , or `` no '' if unresolved .",
    "the fourth column lists the fwhm in arcseconds for the airy disk from gaussian profile fitting , and the fifth column lists the ratio of the major to minor axes of the profile fit .",
    "the sixth and seventh columns contain the separation in arcseconds and the position angle in degrees of the companion , if present .",
    "the eighth and ninth columns list the photometry , in vega magnitudes , for the f814w filter and cousins @xmath9 band .",
    "the last column lists system specific notes .",
    "there are a several sources of photometric and astrometric errors for the data shown in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "first , there is the flux calibration error of the acs / hrc instrument , which is 0.5% @xcite .",
    "second , there is the uncertainty in performing photometry on targets within calibrated , multidrizzled images . for targets with no neighbors within @xmath19 ,",
    "the photometric uncertainty is essentially the inverse of the s / n , which is @xmath20 4% for all 75 photometric targets",
    "( i.e. all white dwarfs and companions ) , and @xmath20 2% for all but 9 sources .",
    "third , there is the error introduced by transforming the flux in the f814w bandpass to the cousins @xmath9 band , which according to @xcite is no more than a few percent .",
    "fourth , there is the error introduced when photometry was executed on a target with a close ( @xmath21 ) companion .",
    "after psf subtraction , a few companion point sources retained a very small amount of residual flux which fell into the @xmath16 pixel photometric aperture of the target star .",
    "this is smaller than @xmath22% of the subtracted target s peak flux (  2.4 ) .",
    "fifth , there is error introduced by using photometric apertures of @xmath16 pixels which were then corrected to @xmath15 pixels .",
    "the standard deviations in these correction factors were @xmath23% , depending on aperture size and spectral type .",
    "the end result of adding all of these photometric errors in quadrature is that : typical errors for isolated point sources are @xmath24 5% , while those for point sources with close companions are typically @xmath24 6% .",
    "only relative astrometry between multiple system components has been perfomred in the study .",
    "the astrometric errors for point sources without close companions are completely due to the uncertainty in centroiding , which is strictly a function of s / n .",
    "these are typically @xmath20 0.04 pixels ( @xmath25 for s / n @xmath26 50 ) . for targets with close companions",
    ", the measured centroid can be biased in the direction of the companion , if its flux is not removed by psf subtraction .",
    "although the measured centroid uncertainty for these binary components had essentially the same range of errors as for single point sources , it is possible that small biases remained for targets contaminated by any positive or negative residual flux from its psf - substracted close companion . using @xmath22 pixel radii for centroiding and comparing the value obtained for a target with a close companion before and after psf subtraction of the companion",
    ", shifts were measured that were no larger than 0.2 pixels ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the centroiding errors for components of close binaries are no larger than this shift .",
    "as can be seen in figures @xmath28 and table [ tbl1 ] , there are 28 systems for which 2 or more objects were totally or partially resolved ( one of which is a previously known wide red dwarf companion that fell within the acs field of view and was itself resolved into 2 close components ) . generally speaking , the acs multidrizzled psfs at f814w had fwhms @xmath29 and were symmetric to within 5% of unity in the ratios of their major to minor axes by gaussian profile fits .",
    "this allowed mostly resolved binaries with clearly separated airy disks to be imaged down to @xmath30 in separation at @xmath31 magnitudes between the components . for those binaries separated by @xmath32 ( 17 in all ) ,",
    "there was very little or no overlap between component psfs , and both the white dwarfs and red dwarfs were used to derive aperture corrections to be used for more closely separated pairs .",
    "it should be noted that there are a few resolved binaries at separations @xmath33 , which , in principle , would be resolvable from the ground with good seeing .",
    "the reason for this is that the sample was selected from unresolved 2mass point sources , where the beam size is approximately @xmath34 at @xmath35 band in the images provided by the archive server .",
    "typically , equally luminous binaries at magnitudes @xmath36 mag can appear partially resolved in 2mass at separations of @xmath37 @xcite . however , the fact that most red dwarfs in this sample are @xmath22 magnitudes brighter than their white dwarf primaries at @xmath35 band makes it difficult or impossible to identify them as binaries in the 2mass images .      for imaged binaries separated by @xmath38 , there are two varieties : those in which two distinct airy disks are present and those in which there is a single , elongated airy disk .",
    "pairs with two distinct psf cores were treated as described above , while those with elongated cores proved problematic during psf fitting and subtraction aimed at revealing individual point sources .",
    "relative to the apparently single stars in the acs image set , these closest binaries all display significantly larger than normal residuals after single psf subtractions are performed , corroborating their binarity .",
    "there are three systems ( 0949@xmath39451 , 1419@xmath39576 , 1631@xmath39781 ) whose",
    "images show the presence of binaries with likely separations @xmath40 , corresponding to a single acs / hrc pixel . in all three cases ,",
    "the elongated airy disk is associated with the red dwarf component of a resolved binary ; i.e. , these systems are all triples .",
    "this is a fortunate situation because in each case the white dwarf component can be used as a comparison psf .",
    "these systems are described in  3.7 .",
    "the separations of these very close binary systems were estimated in the following manner .",
    "all the measured psfs in table [ tbl1 ] show some very minor elongation that is typically on the order of one milliarcsecond .",
    "specifically , the difference between the major and minor axes of the gaussian profile fits is typically @xmath41 mas . for the three close doubles , these differences , or elongations , lie in the range @xmath42 mas .",
    "equally luminous components were assumed and the separation of the binary was taken to be its elongation .",
    "of course , if the pair is not equally bright , then the separation will be slightly larger , but contour plots of all three objects display a high degree of symmetry along the major axes , consistent with equal luminosity .    without spatially resolved spectra of the close binary components of these triple systems",
    ", it can not be firmly concluded that all three are double red dwarfs .",
    "it is likely that only one of the systems will be observable from the ground as a spectroscopic target that is spatially resolved from its white dwarf primary .",
    "therefore , it may be difficult ( or impossible ) to know with certainty the nature of the two close components in the remaining two systems .",
    "however , depending on the actual orbital period , it may be possible with radial velocity monitoring to confirm the nature of these candidate double red dwarfs from the ground over a period of one to a few years .",
    "none of the other 24 spatially resolved white dwarf + red dwarf pairs have separations as small as the three targets with elongated airy disks , and it is a safe assumption ( for reasons discussed in  4 ) that these are double red dwarfs .",
    "there are 15 systems in table [ tbl1 ] for which there is strong photometric evidence , and often spectroscopic evidence , for the presence of an unresolved white dwarf + red dwarf pair .",
    "in fact , a thorough literature search beyond @xcite reveals that a few of these systems are recently ( since their selection as targets for this program ) discovered da+dme systems , radial velocity variables , or low mass ( he core , @xmath43 @xmath44 ) white dwarfs  all of which imply binaries with separations @xmath45 au @xcite , consistent with single point sources in the acs observations . in any case , all of these stars have composite optical and near - infrared colors perfectly consistent with white dwarf and red dwarf components @xcite .",
    "for these binaries , it was necessary to calculate the flux contribution of the white dwarf in order to subtract it and obtain the flux of the red dwarf companion .",
    "this was done utilizing techniques discussed in @xcite and @xcite , and  3.6 , where particular attention was given to avoid biasing the calculations by excluding white dwarf data which may have been contaminated by the cool companion star .",
    "there were 6 targets (  3.7 ) for which the evidence of binarity was based on low s / n ( @xmath46 or @xmath47 ) @xmath48 data in the 2mass point source catalog .",
    "these were included in the hst / acs survey as low priority targets and do not belong to the sample of highly probable white dwarf + red dwarf binaries . as yet , none of these targets have revealed companions in the acs observations .",
    "any study of stellar multiplicity must address the likelihood of physical association between putative companions .",
    "there are several reasons why all the targets designated here as multiples have a very high probability of being gravitationally bound .",
    "the first and foremost is spatial proximity  the white dwarf targets are associated with a single point source in 2mass images .",
    "second , the combination of optical and near - infrared colors yields photometric distance ranges for each component that overlap when appropriate , mundane white dwarf and red dwarf stellar parameters are assumed .",
    "third , some of the systems imaged in this study have published references listed in tables @xmath49 containing spectroscopic confirmation of their red dwarf companions in unresolved , composite observations , and/or previously established common proper motion .",
    "fourth , common proper motion is almost certain for all posited multiples over the timescales since the identification of the white dwarf component @xmath50 years ago ; otherwise any false pairs should separate when `` blinking '' images available through the digitized sky survey ( e.g. , in the northern hemisphere , the first and second epoch palomar observatory sky survey plates ) .",
    "fifth , there exist several white dwarf + red dwarf studies which have established spectroscopic and/or common proper motion confirmation for numerous targets of a nearly identical nature @xcite .",
    "therefore , the multiple stellar systems presented here should be regarded as physically associated until shown otherwise .      to determine the projected companion separations in astronomical units , distances to each binary had to be assessed .",
    "table [ tbl2 ] lists the stellar parameters from the literature for the white dwarf primaries in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the first column contains the white dwarf number , followed by effective temperature , surface gravity , apparent visual magnitude , photometric distance , and references .",
    "a single digit following the decimal place for log @xmath51 indicates an assumption of @xmath52 @xmath44 .",
    "the @xmath53 magnitude is either a value uncontaminated by the red dwarf or one derived ( based on effective temperature and models , magnitudes and colors in other filters , or photographic magnitudes and colors ; @xcite ) to more correctly reflect the likely uncontaminated value .",
    "distances were calculated from absolute magnitudes for individual white dwarfs , using the models of @xcite as well as specified references in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "less than half of the white dwarf targets in table [ tbl2 ] have well - determined stellar parameters ( i.e. , @xmath54 , log @xmath51 ) in the literature and , hence , fairly reliable distance estimates . for these well - studied white dwarfs",
    "there are published parameters based on data ( typically spectra , but also photometry where available ) and analyses which are not contaminated or biased by the light from their red dwarf companions .",
    "fortunately , most if not all ground - based white dwarf studies are performed in the @xmath55   range , where most red dwarfs should not contribute significantly .",
    "however , there are plenty of cases where flux is seen at these wavelengths and this has been taken into account in table [ tbl2 ] and often by authors in the corresponding references .",
    "for the remainder of the targets , published white dwarf parameters do not exist at present ; mccook & sion ( 1999 and references therein ) sometimes contain @xmath56 or other optical photometry , but frequently there is only a single photographic magnitude and/or a spectral type with no temperature index .",
    "therefore , at worst , the values in table [ tbl2 ] represent conservative best guesses  assuming parameters which would make the white dwarf and any companion typical  but more often they are guesses informed by available data . some of the ways in which the effective temperatures and visual magnitudes were estimated for white dwarf targets include : ( 1 ) published @xmath57 color , which is unlikely to be contaminated by a cool companion ; ( 2 ) the implied color indices ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) for any white dwarf which was resolved from its companion in the acs observations ; ( 3 ) information on the colors and spectral type of the companion star from 2mass data , acs photometry , or other literature sources ; ( 4 ) any published optical spectrum revealing one or both of the binary components ( but without parameter determinations ) .",
    "generally , for each target all available information was gleaned from the usno - b1.0 @xcite , 2mass all - sky point source @xcite , and supercosmos sky survey catalogs @xcite to assist in constraining and disentangling binary component stellar parameters .",
    "although photographic photometry can have large absolute calibration errors , typically @xmath59 mag , resultant colors tend to be as accurate as @xmath45 mag for the magnitude range spanned by the white dwarf targets here @xcite and can be useful in a number of ways .",
    "any colors assist in the assessment of where the flux of the red dwarf begins to dominate the spectral energy distribution of the binary , which is typically shortward of 8000  .",
    "if published optical photometry or spectra were suspected of contamination ( i.e. , effective temperature underestimated in the literature ) then adjustments using model colors based on a more likely ( conservative ) temperature were made . in this way ,",
    "the best available data and estimates were used for all targets in order to constrain white dwarf parameters and subsequently deconvolve any composite @xmath60 data to obtain colors and magnitudes for red dwarf companions , following methods described fully in @xcite and @xcite . where model white dwarf parameters were needed , they were taken from @xcite and p. bergeron ( 2002 , private communication ) . where empirical red dwarf parameters were needed , they were taken from @xcite and @xcite .    a separate but related issue is the identification of the hot and cool components for the numerous binaries resolved in the acs observations . utilizing techniques discussed above , and because in almost every case there was a significant brightness difference ( @xmath61 mag ) between the components , there is high confidence that the white dwarf component was correctly identified in the acs images ( possible exceptions are discussed in  3.7 ) . specifically , the implied @xmath62 color of the red dwarf and the @xmath63 color of the white dwarf are consistent only if the components were correctly identified ; reversing identities leads to contradictions .",
    "additionally , the acs camera scatters light at red wavelengths , yielding significant haloes for all bright objects ( see figure 5 of @xcite ) , and broadening the psf of any red objects relative to blue objects @xcite .",
    "the measured psf sizes in table [ tbl1 ] reflect this phenomenon , with a single possible exception discussed in  3.7 . despite apparent good agreement and reassurance that the individual components have been correctly identified , it is by no means absolute . in a few cases , it is possible that an apparently single , resolved binary component is itself an unresolved double red dwarf binary or white dwarf + red dwarf binary .",
    "tables [ tbl3 ] and [ tbl4 ] list the measured and derived parameters of the red dwarf companion stars . in the first column",
    "is the white dwarf number followed by the companion name .",
    "the third column contains the spectral type estimate based on the @xmath62 color listed in the fourth column .",
    "the fifth column lists the photometric distance to the red dwarf based on empirical m dwarf data @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the white dwarf distance estimates listed in table [ tbl2 ] do not always agree with the implied distance to the red dwarf from absolute magnitude - spectral type relations @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons why this might happen : ( 1 ) the white dwarf has a mass significantly above or below the typically assumed 0.60 @xmath44 value for field da stars ; ( 2 ) the effective temperature of the white dwarf has been poorly estimated ; ( 3 ) the spectral type of the red dwarf has been poorly estimated ; ( 4 ) either the white dwarf or red dwarf is itself an unresolved binary ; ( 5 ) the intrinsic width of the lower main sequence in a hertzsprug - russell ( or reduced proper motion ) diagram is at least @xmath64 magnitude , the slope is steep , and placement of a component depends upon both metallicity and age .",
    "this alone can impose on the order of @xmath65 magnitudes of apparent discrepancy with the white dwarf estimate when photometric distances are all that is available .",
    "these are some of the reasons why spectral type estimation was based on color , not on any absolute magnitude implied by the ( often nominal ) photometric distance to the white dwarf @xcite .    in principle , obtaining a good photometric distance to nearly all the white dwarfs in the sample is feasible , since the bulk are da white dwarfs which can be spectroscopically fit sans contamination ( by avoidance if necessary ) in the @xmath66   region for @xmath54 and log @xmath51 .",
    "however , a similar spectroscopic assessment is not possible for the red dwarf secondaries ; spectral types can be determined to limited accuracy by subtracting the expected white dwarf contribution over @xmath67  , but the equivalent of a stellar radius ( log @xmath51 ) determination does not exist .",
    "using empirical absolute magnitude - spectral type relations is likely to prove reliable in most cases ( assuming knowledge of an accurate spectral type ) ; however , there is intrinsic scatter in absolute magnitudes for a given red dwarf spectral type , potentially compounded up to @xmath68 magnitudes by metallicity and/or multiplicity @xcite . for comparison and completeness ,",
    "the red dwarf distance from color - magnitude relations is also listed in the tables .      _",
    "0023@xmath39388 _ is more likely closer to @xmath69 pc than 24 pc as suggested by references in @xcite .",
    "the distance underestimate is likely due to the unresolved red dwarf causing the white dwarf to appear redder , cooler and , hence , nearer @xcite .    _",
    "0131@xmath70163 _ is a singular case in which it was difficult to distinguish which resolved star is the white dwarf or red dwarf .",
    "the parameters in table [ tbl3 ] present the most consistent scenario , but a full optical spectrum and multiband photometry should be able to reveal which star contributes more flux around 8000  .    _",
    "0208@xmath70153 _ is the only resolved pair in which the psf widths do not follow the pattern of @xmath71 .",
    "the reason for this is unclear , but given the fact that acs scatters more light for redder objects , this white dwarf could conceivably harbor an unresolved red companion .    _",
    "0237@xmath39115 , 0347@xmath70137 , 1218@xmath39497 , 1333@xmath39005 , and 1458@xmath39171 _ all appear to have discrepancies betwen the distances implied by the ( sometimes inferred ) brightness of the white dwarf and red dwarf binary components .",
    "many of the white dwarfs have reliable log @xmath51 determinations @xcite but the cool companion appears too bright for its color and , hence , may be a binary . in other cases , the white dwarf may be overluminous ( or the red dwarf may be underluminous ) .",
    "these cases are those that stand out presently , but spectroscopic observations ( which are currently being obtained ) may resolve them .    _ 0324@xmath39738 _ has many measurements in @xcite and the current online version of that catalog that are either contaminated by nearby background stars or were performed on the wrong stars .",
    "recently published values of @xmath72 k and an extremely low mass @xcite are also likely due to the same phenomenon , as the white dwarf is currently moving between two background stars and has a nearby ( @xmath73 ) red dwarf common proper motion companion ( which is incorrectly identified as the white dwarf by coordinates in @xcite and finder charts provided in the current online version of that catalog ) .",
    "these four stars are all currently within a @xmath74 radius of one another . for the present work ,",
    "the correct stars were identified by using digitized sky survey images to confirm the pair by their common proper motion over 40 years and by their photographic magnitudes , colors and positions in the usno - a2.0 , usno - b1.0 , and 2mass catalogs @xcite . from the acs images ,",
    "the white dwarf has coordinates of @xmath75 while the brighter component of the double red dwarf ( resolved in the observations ) is located at @xmath76 , both epoch 2005.09 .",
    "using @xcite and the acs data gives @xmath77 for the white dwarf and ( if correct ) together with its measured parallax of @xmath78 would give @xmath79 k and log @xmath80 ( @xmath81 @xmath44 ) .",
    "the properly identified white dwarf does not have any published , accurate , and uncontaminated near - infrared data and , hence , there is currently no evidence for any close ( i.e. unresolved by acs ) , cool companion .    _",
    "1133@xmath39489 _ is the same object as sdss j113609.59 + 484318.9 for which @xcite recently determined that the white dwarf is a db star with @xmath82 k , despite the presence of he ii absorption at 4686   in their spectrum , together with an m6 or later companion .",
    "the white dwarf was found to be a composite white dwarf by @xcite and @xcite who correctly determined the primary to be a type do star with @xmath83 k plus a cool companion . however",
    ", a companion as late as m6 would place this system at a distance of about 166 pc based on @xmath84 from 2mass , implying @xmath85 mag for the white dwarf and a mass @xmath86 @xmath44 .",
    "the present analysis finds the @xmath62 color of the companion gives a spectral type of m5 , consistent if the white dwarf has log @xmath87 ( @xmath88 @xmath44 ) .    _ 1247@xmath39550 , 2211@xmath39372 , 2323@xmath39256 , and 2349@xmath70283 _ are all low priority targets whose 2mass photometry in the second incremental data release , despite low s / n at @xmath48 , suggested near - infrared excess @xcite .",
    "some of these targets have @xmath84 data in the all sky point source catalog which differ significantly from the preceeding catalog values @xcite .",
    "none of these white dwarfs show any evidence of companions in the acs images , and until more accurate near - infrared photometry is available , binarity should be considered unlikely .    _",
    "1517@xmath39502 _ is a rare da+dc ( white dwarf + dwarf carbon star ) system @xcite which remained unresolved in the acs observation .",
    "the expected magnitude difference at @xmath9 band is 1.05 mag ; thus , conservatively speaking , a separation of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 au ) can likely be ruled out .    _",
    "1603@xmath39125 _ is listed in @xcite as a possible magnetic white dwarf , type dah .",
    "based on the deconvolved , @xmath91 , color for the companion , a spectral type of k3 is inferred .",
    "this places the system at @xmath92 pc and implies that the primary is very likely an sdb star with @xmath93 mag @xcite .    _",
    "1619@xmath39525 _ displays three objects within a @xmath94 radius on the acs images ; their separations and magnitudes are listed in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "the photometry was performed with color and aperture corrections appropriate for one white dwarf and two red dwarfs of the implied intrinsic faintness and color .",
    "if this is a physical triple , then the ratio of the projected separations is 5.6 to 1 .",
    "the companionship of the two brighter stars is quite firm as the elongated pair can be seen on at least 2 digitized sky survey images , almost certainly comoving over 43 years .",
    "the third candidate companion lies within @xmath19 of the white dwarf , which is located at @xmath95 .",
    "hence , they are quite likely to be physically associated .",
    "additionally , the candidate third component appears quite red , as would be expected of a late m dwarf ; the 2mass images are elongated at @xmath96 , and especially at @xmath48 , along the correct position angle .",
    "this is consistent if the tertiary candidate is a companion because , although the brightness difference of the two red dwarfs is 2.8 magnitudes at @xmath9 band , it should become @xmath97 magnitudes in the near - infrared if the two contributing components are around m5 and da2.8+m7 @xcite .",
    "attempts to deconvolve the 2mass magnitudes into two components failed , however , and the 2mass photometry may be inaccurate due to the presence of two objects ( the white dwarf should contribute very little in the near - infrared ) .",
    "ground - based followup should conclusively demonstrate that this system is a da2.8+dm5+dm7 ( approximate m types ) triple system .    _",
    "1631@xmath39781 _ is a triple system with a well - resolved red dwarf companion which is itself a barely resolved double .",
    "this system is mentioned in 47 papers in the literature since its discovery by @xcite , at least 12 of which mention or discuss its nature as a precatacylsmic variable or post - common envelope binary .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite demonstrated the unlikelihood that the main binary lies in a close orbit by finding an absence of radial velocity variability in the balmer emission lines from the companion .",
    "@xcite added the possibility that the system is face on or has low enough inclination to preclude significant variations in radial velocity as seen from earth .",
    "@xcite conclude that the system is not face on from a positive detection of rotational broadening ( @xmath98 km s@xmath99 ) in the red dwarf at several lines in a high resolution optical spectrum .",
    "given that all components of the triple system are seen in the acs image , it is entirely possible that this system has a low inclination , and the line broadening reported by @xcite might be due in part or in whole to the binarity of the red dwarf component .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , @xcite lists this system among all known detached , post - common envelope binaries with known periods , citing @xcite who report x - ray variability with a period of @xmath100 hours and a false - alarm probability of 4.4% .",
    "since the main binary is quite widely separated , the source of the x - ray variations are either intrinsic to the hot degenerate star itself ( i.e. , perhaps a starspot ) as seen in other single white dwarfs @xcite , or flare activity from one or both components of the red dwarf pair @xcite . in any case , two things are clear from the acs data . first , this system never shared a common envelope , as the current projected separation of the double red dwarf from the primary is 17 au ( @xmath101 years ) .",
    "second , all the documented optical emission features arise from activity within the double red dwarf system , either intrinsic to one or both of the stars ( interactions are unlikely at @xmath102 au , @xmath103 days ) .    _",
    "1845@xmath39683 _ is a hot white dwarf ( @xmath104 mag , @xmath105 k ; see references in table [ tbl2 ] ) reported as a binary in both @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the second reference is merely pointing to the work presented in the first reference , as there exists no other discoverable discussion of suspected binarity of this white dwarf in the literature .",
    "the 2mass catalog gives @xmath106 mag , @xmath107 mag , and an upper limit of @xmath108 mag for the white dwarf , which are consistent with a single star of the appropriate effective temperature , and also consistent with the acs @xmath9 band magnitude .",
    "@xcite have @xmath109 mag and @xmath110 mag which apparently corresponds to a field star located @xmath111 away at @xmath112 , which has 2mass photometry of @xmath113 mag , @xmath114 mag , and @xmath115 mag , all with s / n @xmath116 .",
    "all this suggests that the white dwarf is neither a suspected nor confirmed binary .    _",
    "2151@xmath70015 _ contains a resolved m8 dwarf , the coolest companion resolved in the survey so far .",
    "the identity of the white dwarf and red dwarf components are firm from ground - based @xmath117 images , where the m star is seen partially resolved only at @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "however , the white dwarf exhibits a significant halo in the acs image which is unexpected for a @xmath118 k object , and not seen in other white dwarf primaries  even those with unresolved , spectroscopically confirmed , late m dwarf companions such as 0354@xmath39463 ( rubin 80 , da6+dm7 ; @xcite ) .",
    "while this may simply be the result of the fact that the primary is relatively bright compared to the other resolved white dwarfs , it might be due to a third , unresolved , even cooler component .",
    "this hst / acs survey was specifically designed to search for white dwarf + red dwarf binaries separated by around one to a few au .",
    "theory predicts , and extant observations support , a bimodal distribution of orbital separations in which low mass companions vacate this region during the post - main sequence evolution of the white dwarf progenitor @xcite .",
    "specifically , companions within a few au should interact both directly and tidally with the agb slow wind and expanding photosphere , imparting some of their angular momentum to the envelope and arriving eventually at closer orbital semimajor axes .",
    "those companions originally outside of a few au should eschew the agb envelope and experience an expansion of their orbital semimajor axes by a factor proportional to the total amount of mass lost there is no a priori reason to believe that the phase space around @xmath119 au should be utterly devoid of low mass main sequence companions to white dwarfs .",
    "in fact , there should be some real width in both peaks of the actual bimodal distribution of separations , each with tails overlapping the `` forbidden '' range of semimajor axes .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] displays the sensitivity of the survey to companions in the few au range . here",
    ", two assumptions are used ; 1 ) @xmath120 sensitivity , for companions at @xmath121 mag and 2 ) @xmath122 sensitivity , for companions at @xmath123 mag .",
    "these assumptions are conservative , especially given the performed psf subtractions .",
    "all targetted binary candidates are expected to have flux ratios corresponding @xmath124 mag in the f814w filter .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the distribution of projected separations for detected companions and upper limits for unresolved binaries .",
    "so far , no white dwarf + red dwarf systems have been resolved at separations around a few au .",
    "the ability of this survey to detect binaries of comparable luminosity at such separations is demonstrated by both figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , plus the three very close binaries ( likely double red dwarfs ) in table [ tbl5 ] , implying that pairs separated by as little as 1 au at @xmath125 pc were at least partially resolvable .",
    "although accurate distances are needed for the sample stars to confirm these preliminary findings , there are not yet any ambiguous cases where a reasonable change in the distance to the binary would bring the separation into the few au range",
    ".    if these initial conclusions are correct , these data are the first empirical evidence for the bimodal distribution of low mass , unevolved companions to white dwarfs .",
    "this would also imply that as many as 100% of the 15 unresolved white dwarf + red dwarf pairs are in close orbits , and good candidates for radial velocity variables .",
    "if the first half of this survey is representative of the whole , it should be expected that this program will eventually resolve around 55 total wide binaries , and identify around 30 total binaries that are candidate radial velocity variables .",
    "followup work is currently being carried out for all program stars for which a good photometric distance determination ( i.e. , reliable @xmath56 photometry , @xmath54 , and log @xmath51 ) does not exist in the literature . in order to assess the physical separations of the low mass companions in au ,",
    "an accurate distance is required .",
    "combined with the near - infrared data , optical photometry and spectroscopy should allow a complete determination of stellar parameters for these binary and triple systems .",
    "stellar parameters are not only needed to determine distance and separation for these binaries , but also to study the system components themselves .",
    "another goal of this survey is to compare the masses ( via spectral types ) of the red dwarf companions in wide , resolved systems versus those in unresolved , likely post - common envelope systems . given enough stars in both categories , a statistical analysis can be made of the resulting spectral type ( and , by proxy , mass ) distributions to see what effect , if any , common envelope evolution has had on the secondary masses @xcite",
