    "a prominent feature of the stable lvy processes is the existence of algebraic , long tails of the probability distributions of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a stability index . as a consequence ,",
    "the moments , in particular the variance , are divergent . the diffusion process in such systems is called an `` accelerated diffusion '' and the relative transport rate may be described by a time - dependence of the fractional moments instead of the variance .",
    "however , there are indications that in some physical problems the distribution tails fall faster than for the pure lvy flight . in the field of the economic research",
    ", the indexes 2.5  4 were observed in financial data @xcite ; it has been suggested that such values of the index arise when the trading behaviour is performed in an optimal way @xcite .",
    "the probability distributions of the hydraulic conductivity in the porous media seem to obey the power law with the index 3.5 , while the atmospheric turbulence studies yield even larger index for the wind field @xcite .",
    "such slowly falling algebraic tails are predicted by the langevin equation with the lvy stable noise  in a sense of the stationary solution  when one introduces an appropriate deterministic potential .",
    "it has been demonstrated by chechkin et al .",
    "@xcite that the stationary distribution tails of the form @xmath2 result from the potential @xmath3 .",
    "also temporal characteristics of the system may influence the asymptotic shape of the distribution .",
    "this happens if , for a jumping process , long jumps are penalised by a short waiting time .",
    "the finite variance is observed for such jumping processes as the lvy walk @xcite and the kangaroo process with a lvy distributed jumping size @xcite .    the lvy stable processes are often connected with complex phenomena for which the power - law shape of the distribution tails @xcite is typical , as well as a complicated structure of the medium .",
    "it is the case for the porous media , plasmas and fractal ( multifractal ) structures @xcite .",
    "therefore , a nonhomogeneity must often be taken into account in a dynamical description , both as a deterministic potential and as a multiplicative noise .",
    "descriptions of the diffusion on fractals involve the variable , power - law diffusion coefficient @xcite .",
    "also the other topologically complicated systems with long jumps , the folded polymers , require a variable diffusion coefficient to describe the transport @xcite .",
    "moreover , formalisms with the multiplicative lvy noise can describe the second order phase transitions @xcite and the dynamics of two competing species @xcite .",
    "a nonlinearity of the langevin equation makes the stochastic process different from the pure lvy motion .",
    "in particular , variance may be finite for a system driven by the multiplicative lvy noise @xcite . generally , the variance rises not only linearly with time but also faster or slower than that , i.e. the diffusion may be anomalous . in the case of ref.@xcite ,",
    "motion is subdiffusive .",
    "the above approach includes the white noise .",
    "however , a markovian description of a realistic system is an idealisation , valid only if the time scale of fast variables is short , compared to the time scale of the process variable .",
    "a procedure of the fast variables elimination produces correlations : they are present even if the original system is markovian @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated for the gaussian noise that characteristic time scales of the fast variables are important even if the variables themselves are eliminated @xcite ; this finding suggests using a coloured noise in a stochastic description rather than the white noise .",
    "effects related to the correlations are important , for example , for such problems as fluctuations of a dye laser light @xcite and a narrowing of the magnetic resonance lines @xcite .",
    "importance of the finite correlation time for noise - induced phase transitions was emphasised in ref.@xcite ; an increase of that time favours disorder and prevents the formation of an ordered state .",
    "introducing the white noise as a limit of the finite correlation time means that the stochastic integral should be interpreted in a stratonovich sense @xcite . on the other hand , effects of the finite inertia",
    "should be taken into account .",
    "if the relaxation time associated with the inertia is large compared to the correlation time , the it interpretation comes into play @xcite .",
    "that effect of the inertia , opposite to the correlations , was demonstrated in ref.@xcite : it modifies the front propagation by suppressing the external multiplicative , white noise influence on the velocity of fronts .",
    "the it - stratonovich dilemma becomes especially interesting for @xmath4 since then  when we consider the white lvy noise and neglect the inertia  the very existence of the variance depends on the particular interpretation of the stochastic integral .",
    "this problem is important for the diffusion since the infinite variance , which means the infinite propagation speed , is unphysical in most cases . how do the finite noise relaxation time and the inertia modify slope of the distribution ?",
    "we address this question in the present paper and discuss consequences for the diffusion . in sec.ii a linear problem involving the additive noise is considered .",
    "sec.iii is devoted to the multiplicative noise ; both limiting , analytically solvable cases and numerical solutions are discussed . moreover , the escape time from a potential well is calculated .",
    "results are summarised in sec.iv .",
    "we consider a linear problem which is defined by the following system of the langevin equations for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a damping coefficient .",

    "special cases of the system ( [ la ] ) were considered by several authors .",
    "the velocity distribution for the white noise without a potential was obtained in ref.@xcite , the linear force case was discussed in ref.@xcite and the white noise case with the inertia for @xmath12 in ref.@xcite . moreover ,",

    "the case @xmath13 corresponds to the normal distribution .",
    "then the third equation ( [ la ] ) describes the standard ornstein - uhlenbeck process with the covariance @xmath14 therefore @xmath15 determines a correlation time , @xmath16 .",
    "a generalisation of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process for @xmath4 implies an infinite covariance for any time .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath15 can still estimate the noise relaxation time .",
    "one can modify the covariance definition @xcite to get a convergent quantity which behaves with time similar to eq.([ouc ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , the covariance becomes finite when one introduces a truncation of the lvy distribution @xcite .",
    "properties of such a dynamical system are similar to the system without the truncation for an arbitrarily large time @xcite and the parameter @xmath15 measures the correlation time .",
    "values of the process @xmath10 are given by the characteristic function @xmath17 @xmath18 .",

    "then eq.([la ] ) yields @xmath29 secondly , for the case of a free - particle ( @xmath30 ) we obtain @xmath31    the characteristic function of @xmath22 directly follows from eq.([f2 ] ) @xcite : @xmath32 eq.([ave ] ) implies the lvy distribution with the same stability index as the driving noise @xmath33 and a translation parameter which coincides with @xmath34 and for large time equals either @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) or @xmath37 ( @xmath30 ) . since the dependence of the density distribution on @xmath38 is trivial , we assume in the following @xmath39 and @xmath40 . then the distribution is symmetric for any time .",
    "the inverse fourier transform can be conveniently expressed in a form of the fox function @xcite : @xmath41 ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 . by introducing a new variable @xmath43",
    "we have @xmath44 and the exponentials in the second integral can be dropped for any @xmath45 .",
    "therefore @xmath46const for large times .",
    "since @xmath47 for @xmath48 , variance and all higher moments of the distribution ( [ pfok ] ) are divergent , as well as the average if @xmath49",
    ". a relative expansion rate can be quantified by the fractional moments of the order @xmath50 , @xmath51 ; they are given by the mellin transform from the fox function @xcite .",
    "the final expression reads @xmath52 consequently , in the limit of large @xmath53 the fractional moments decrease with the damping coefficient @xmath9 and the expansion rate is large for small @xmath54 .    as an example , let us consider the case @xmath12 for which results take the transparent form .",
    "this particular value of the stability parameter corresponds to the well - known cauchy distribution ; it was considered in ref.@xcite for the white noise . for @xmath55 ,",
    "a straightforward calculation yields the expression for the apparent width of the distribution @xmath22 : @xmath56 in the limit of the large time , inertia and noise relaxation time are responsible for a time - shift which is negative and rises with @xmath57 and @xmath16 .",
    "by introducing a multiplicative noise we take into account that the influence of the random component of the dynamics depends on the dynamics itself .",
    "the one - dimensional case is given by the langevin equation @xmath58 in the following we assume the noise intensity in the algebraic form , @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the simplest problem involves the white noise ( @xmath61 ) and neglects the inertia .",
    "the latter condition means that mass is small compared to the damping parameter @xmath9 and the strength of the noise .",
    "the case of the normal distribution , @xmath13 , is well - known @xcite .",
    "a stochastic integral in the langevin equation is not completely determined for the uncorrelated noise , since it is not clear whether the dynamical variable in the function @xmath62 should be evaluated at the time before the noise acts , after that , or somewhere in between .",
    "two interpretations are of particular importance . in the it interpretation ,",
    "the @xmath63 s component of the discretized stochastic integral is @xmath64[\\xi(t_i)-\\xi(t_{i-1})]$ ] , whereas the stratonovich interpretation includes both the beginning and the end of each interval : @xmath65/2\\}[\\xi(t_i)-\\xi(t_{i-1})]$ ] .",
    "both assumptions result in a different fokker - planck equation but a difference resolves itself solely to a drift term ( the spurious drift ) which can be eliminated by an appropriate modification of the deterministic potential . for this reason , a physical relevance of the it - stratonovich dilemma",
    "is disputed @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , physical implications of both interpretations may be different .",
    "for example , phase transitions due to instabilities of the disordered phase in the framework of the ginzburg - landau model take place only for the stratonovich interpretation @xcite .",
    "rules of the ordinary calculus are valid in the stratonovich formalism , in contrast to the it interpretation .",
    "the meaning of both interpretations becomes more transparent when we take into account the finite correlations and inertia .",
    "first of all , the memory effects favour the stratonovich interpretation since it constitutes the white - noise limit of the correlated processes @xcite .",
    "inertia acts in the opposite direction .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite  by the estimation of the velocity moments and using the it formula  that if the inertia relaxation time goes to zero faster than the noise correlation time , the stratonovich interpretation is valid .",
    "the opposite limit produces the it result . if both time scales are comparable , neither of the above interpretations is valid .",
    "we will demonstrate that similar conclusions can be drawn for the general lvy stable processes .",
    "however , for @xmath4 methods of ref.@xcite can not be applied since the moments are divergent and the it formula is unknown .",
    "we take into account only it and stratonovich interpretations of the stochastic integral .",
    "the it interpretation applies , beside the systems with large mass , to discrete problems ; it is commonly used in the perturbation theory @xcite . however , there are indications that other interpretations are also important . for example",
    ", it was recently experimentally demonstrated that description of the brownian motion in the presence of gravitational and electrostatic forces requires a backward integral ( anti - it interpretation ) @xcite .      to study a diffusion process",
    ", we consider a free particle , @xmath66 . in the limit @xmath67 and @xmath61 , eq.([lam ] ) becomes a single langevin equation of the first order : @xmath68 where , for simplicity , we assumed @xmath69 . in the it interpretation it corresponds to the fokker - planck equation @xcite @xmath70,\\ ] ] which differs from the equation for the additive noise by an algebraic term under the fractional derivative",
    "this particular form of the multiplicative factor suggests simple scaling properties and a possible similarity of the solution to eq.([pfok ] ) .",
    "indeed , an asymptotic solution of eq.([fraceo ] ) can be found in the form @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the procedure is the following @xcite .",
    "first , we insert the above expression to the langevin equation and take the fourier transform , which also has a form of the fox function but of a higher order .",
    "expansion of the fox functions in powers of @xmath72 and neglecting the terms of the order @xmath73 and higher yields a simple differential equation for the function @xmath74 and allows us to determine some fox function coefficients .",
    "finally , we obtain the solution @xmath75 ,     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 and the coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 are arbitrary .",
    "the asymptotic form of the solution is the same as for the driving noise , @xmath79 therefore , for the it interpretation the variance is always divergent which implies accelerated diffusion .",
    "fractional moments can be evaluated similarly to the additive noise case ; a straightforward calculation yields @xmath80 the multiplicative noise parameter @xmath81 can both strengthen ( @xmath82 ) and weaken ( @xmath83 ) the time - dependence of @xmath84 , compared to the case of the additive noise .",
    "the undetermined coefficients do not influence the functional dependences .",
    "the same method of solution can be applied in the presence of the linear deterministic force @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "results for the stratonovich interpretation are qualitatively different since the decline of the noise intensity with @xmath5 may compensate the effect of the long jumps .",
    "the technical advantage of this interpretation , for one - dimensional systems , consists in a possibility of applying rules of the ordinary calculus .",
    "this property is strict for @xmath13 @xcite . in the general case ,",
    "the noise distribution must be truncated , a requirement that is obvious for the linear systems @xcite .",

    "<S> the inertia is included and the noise , represented by a generalised ornstein - uhlenbeck process , has a finite relaxation time . a general linear problem ( the additive noise ) is solved : the resulting distribution converges with time to the distribution for the white - noise , massless case . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , a multiplicative noise is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> it can make the distribution steeper and the variance , which is finite , depends sublinearly on time ( subdiffusion ) . for a small mass , a white - noise limit corresponds to the stratonovich interpretation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution tails agree with the it interpretation if the inertia is very large . an escape time from the potential well is calculated . </S>"
