    "cosmic - ray nucleosynthesis is the only known galactic source of the 6 @xcite .",
    "thus , it is a standard belief that the observed solar abundance of 6 was produced by galactic cosmic - ray ( gcr ) interactions with the interstellar medium ( ism ) , where @xmath3 is the dominant channel @xcite .",
    "however , hadronic",
    "crs also produce gamma rays , and thus gcr interactions in normal galaxies are guaranteed to contribute @xcite to the observed extragalactic gamma - ray background ( hereafter egrb ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , since they both originate from cr interactions , 6 and hadronic gamma - rays are tightly related .",
    "@xcite established a simple and model - independent connection between lithium and `` pionic '' @xmath4-ray production ( @xmath5 ) by a given cosmic - ray population . using this tool with simplifying assumptions gave the alarming result that the solar 6 abundance , if produced entirely by gcrs , demands a pionic @xmath4-ray intensity exceeding the _ entire _ observed egrb @xcite .",
    "given the current interest in 6 , this result thus deserves a thorough investigation .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the problem of li@xmath4-ray consistency with a more precise and realistic calculation .",
    "we now employ a carefully propagated cr spectrum , as opposed to the standard single - power law spectrum adopted in @xcite . moreover , instead of using a convenient fit for the pionic @xmath4-ray spectrum @xcite we now calculate it self - consistently from our cr spectrum .",
    "we also estimate the spallation @xmath6 contribution to the solar 6 abundance .",
    "these effects slightly reduce but do not eliminate the discrepancy",
    ". moreover , the only remaining effect we expect to be important6 destruction as it is processed through stars  makes the problem more severe .",
    "the net effect is that in a realistic calculation , the observed egrb allows for only @xmath7 to be produced by standard gcrs .",
    "only a conspiracy of extreme assumptions gives gcr production of the solar 6 that does not at the same time saturate the observed egrb .",
    "our result represents a strong hint for the need of a new 6 source .",
    "recent suggestions such as dark matter and low - energy cosmic rays are discussed in  [ sect : discussion ] .",
    "upcoming gamma - ray observations by _ glast _ @xcite will better constrain ( or determine ! ) the pionic @xmath4-ray fraction of the egrb and will thus be the key in determining the severity of this problem .",
    "in @xcite we formally demonstrated and quantified the tight connection between cr lithium synthesis and hadronic @xmath4-ray production .",
    "we showed that both observables are a measure of the time - integrated cr flux ( fluence @xmath8 ) .",
    "specifically , the ratio of the `` pionic '' @xmath4-ray intensity @xmath9 ( integrated over the entire energy spectrum ) and 6 abundance ( baryon or mole fraction @xmath10 ) produced in fusion reactions with the ism can be expressed essentially as the ratio of their reaction rates [ eq : gamma2li ] = this factorizes into a product of nuclear , cosmological , and cosmic - ray parameters , and a `` copernican '' factor @xmath11 .",
    "cosmology enters via the comoving baryon number density @xmath12 . the cosmic - ray and ism helium abundances",
    "are taken to be @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the flux - averaged pionic @xmath4-ray production cross - section is @xmath15 where the factor of 2 counts the number of photons per pion decay , @xmath16 is the cross section , @xmath17 is the pion multiplicity , and the factor @xmath18 accounts for @xmath19 and @xmath20 reactions @xcite .",
    "for @xmath21 we have used a recent result of @xcite , which for 6 differs significantly from the old values . the use of the new cross sections results in a lower 6 production .",
    "the ratio @xmath11 is the ratio of the line - of - sight baryon - averaged fluence to the local fluence ; this `` copernican ratio '' compares the cumulative cosmic - ray activity of our galaxy to that of an average star - forming galaxy .",
    "following our previous work we will initially take this factor be @xmath22 , i.e. that the milky way cr flux through out the history can be approximated with the cosmic mean .",
    "we will then examine the consequences that this ratio differs significantly from unity .",
    "in eq .  ( [ eq : gamma2li ] ) , the li-@xmath4-ray proportionality depends on the ratio of the mean cross sections @xmath23 .",
    "these must be properly averaged over the gcr energy spectrum .",
    "in @xcite we have adopted a standard propagated cosmic - ray spectrum which is a single power - law in total energy with a spectral index @xmath24 over the entire relevant energy range .",
    "while this is a commonly - used rough approximation to the gcr spectrum , it becomes inaccurate at energies @xmath25 gev , where ionization energy losses dominate over escape losses .",
    "because @xmath1 threshold energy is at @xmath26 mev / nucleon , while @xmath27 threshold is at @xmath28 mev , the li-@xmath4 connection is particularly sensitive to gcr behavior at very low energies .",
    "thus in this paper we refine on the analysis presented in @xcite by calculating and implementing a carefully propagated cr spectrum for a leaky box model @xcite .",
    "the resulting cr spectrum calculated using the standard leaky box model , assuming a standard source spectrum that is a power - law in momentum ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "this gives a cr flux @xmath29 times higher around @xmath1 threshold , compared to the one used in @xcite where a single power - law spectrum was assumed , while for energies @xmath30 mev a single - power law spectrum is a good approximation .",
    "@xcite provide a useful parametrization of the pionic @xmath4-ray spectrum used in @xcite .",
    "however , here we numerically calculate the pionic @xmath4-ray spectrum in full detail , by adopting the isobar+scaling model as given in @xcite ; the pionic spectrum we adopt uses the same cosmic - ray spectrum as the 6 production , and thus is self - consistent .    in order to calculate @xmath9",
    "one needs to know the history of the cr sources and the targets .",
    "both histories come from the cosmic star - formation rate .",
    "as described in detail in @xcite we can obtain the gcr pionic @xmath4-ray spectrum integrated over the history of the sources ( equation 26 of * ? ?",
    "? * same parameter values used ) .",
    "the cosmic star - formation rate alone fixes the _ shape _ of the pionic egrb , but requires a normalization that physically connects the star formation rate to the cosmic - ray flux , and which normalizes the present gas fraction in a typical galaxy . in order to place an",
    "_ upper limit _ to the pionic egrb , we allow this normalization to vary freely to maximize the pionic @xmath4-ray flux consistent with present egrb observations @xcite .",
    "this is presented in fig . 1 as a dotted green line .",
    "the observed egrb spectrum is that of @xcite and is plotted as red data points , with a black solid line fit @xcite .",
    "finally , we find maximal pionic @xmath4-ray fraction to be @xmath31 of the total observed egrb .",
    "more realistically , we can use the milky way to determine both the scaling between the star formation rate and the cosmic - ray flux , and the present - day gas fraction .",
    "we do this following @xcite , using a present gas content of the milky way @xmath32 , and a star formation rate @xmath33 . the resulting @xmath4-ray spectrum is presented in fig . 1 as a blue dashed line .",
    "this corresponds to the pionic @xmath4-ray contribution expected from the normal galaxies .",
    "in addition to this guaranteed component to the egrb , unresolved blazars will also contribute significantly @xcite , presumably comprising much or all of the remaining signal .",
    "having determined a upper limit and a more realistic estimate to @xmath9 one can find the corresponding li abundance , via eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma2li ] ) .",
    "this is our main goal , to which we now turn .",
    "in this section we calculate limits to and estimates of the 6 produced by gcrs that are allowed by preset egrb data .",
    "we present our results in steps of increasing realism .",
    "for now we retain the copernican assumption that the milky way cosmic - ray fluence is typical of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath34 ) ; we will revisit this assumption in the final section .    \\1 . by combining ( [ eq : gamma2li ] ) with the _ maximal _ pionic @xmath4-ray fraction and procedure described in @xcite , we find the fraction of 6 abundance produced in @xmath35 reaction to be @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this corresponds to an extreme upper limit for all 6 produced by the gcr @xmath38 reaction .",
    "though the @xmath38 reaction with the ism is the dominant channel for 6 production , a non - negligible contribution , especially at higher metallicity , comes from the spallation reactions @xmath39 ( both forward and inverse kinematics , that is fast heavy nuclei , are included ) .",
    "if the fusion and cno reaction rates were to be equal the required oxygen abundance should be @xmath40 .",
    "this now sets the normalization and allows us to calculate the total 6 abundance produced from all channels under the extreme assumption that the ism was at _ solar metallicity _ over the galactic history .",
    "we find that @xmath41 , which now represents the extreme upper limit for _ all _ 6 produced by gcrs .",
    "because the cosmic - ray cno abundance is a direct function of the galactic supernova rate , a precise calculation introduces a factor of 1/2 , that is , instead of assuming solar metallicity through out history one should use an average value of @xmath42 .",
    "this results in the total allowed gcr - produced 6 abundance of @xmath43 , which is still consistent with the standard picture .",
    "so far we have been taking the maximal ( fig .",
    "1 , dotted green line ) pionic @xmath4-ray fraction as allowed by the present egrb data , where we have ( without justification ) ignored the normalization and just used the shape of our spectrum . however , it is unrealistic to assume that the entire emission is due to gcrs . indeed ,",
    "independent of the details of our galactic @xmath4-ray estimate , it is clear that the egrb must contain a large and perhaps dominant contribution from unresolved agns ( blazars ) and so the galactic signal must leave room for this and can not saturate the observed level .",
    "an estimate of the normalized gcr pionic @xmath4-ray component of the egrb ( fig .",
    "1 , dashed blue line ) yields a spectrum that is a factor of 2.1 lower than the maximized value . thus ,",
    "in this most honest case , we find @xmath44 which now falls short by about a factor of 2 from a standard picture of cosmic - ray 6 nucleosynthesis .",
    "\\5 . for inverse",
    "cno kinematics a non - negligible libeb production comes from two - step spallation reactions , eg .",
    "@xmath45 @xcite .",
    "for example , the production rate of 6 from two - step reactions of fast oxygen is @xmath46 of single - step fast oxygen spallation reactions , for a fixed @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "however , when two - step inverse cno kinematics is taken into account , the overall increase is only slight and the result now becomes [ eq : result ] 6_gcr=0.59  6 _ even in the most extreme assumption that the two - step rates are equal to the single - step inverse cno kinematic rates , the resulting 6 abundance would still be only @xmath48 of the solar .",
    "finally , one has to remember that the observed solar 6 abundance is not the total lithium abundance produced , due to astration , that is , the fact that some of the gas was already processed by stars . due to very fragile nature of this isotope",
    ", @xmath49 is only the lower bound on the total 6 produced . for",
    "a rough estimate of the level of astration one can use deuterium .",
    "it is well established that big bang nucleosynthesis is the only important source of d @xcite and that d is easily destroyed in stars due to a similarly fragile nature .",
    "thus by comparing the solar nebula d abundance @xmath50 @xcite with the abundance determined from 5 best quasar absorption systems @xmath51 @xcite , we find that roughly @xmath52 of the gas has passed through stars .",
    "thus @xmath53 is about @xmath54 of @xmath55 , and our calculated gcr 6 now becomes @xmath56 .",
    "in this paper we have used the connection between 6 and pionic @xmath4-rays produced in cr interactions , in order to calculate the total allowed 6 abundance that can be produced by gcrs .",
    "we have used a cr spectrum , carefully propagated according to the leaky - box model , while the pionic @xmath4-ray spectrum was calculated based on the @xcite model . a realistic , detailed calculation that includes 6 production from both fusion reaction with the ism and spallation cno channels ( 2-step inverse kinematics also included ) ,",
    "yields a 6 abundance that is only @xmath57 of the total 6 produced , if standard gcrs are the only relevant source .",
    "correcting for astration will result in even lower @xmath58 abundance at the level of @xmath59 .",
    "our result either indicates the need for a new important source of 6 beyond standard gcr nucleosynthesis , or it points to a possible failure of the usual assumption that the average interstellar gcr flux tracks the instantaneous star formation rate .",
    "we consider each possibility in turn .",
    "additional sources of 6 are of considerable current interest , because of the recent report of a 6 plateau in metal - poor halo stars @xcite . as with the familiar 7 spite plateau ,",
    "an analogous 6 feature would suggest a pre - galactic source of 6 . and indeed , recently two very different cosmological sources of 6 have been proposed : ( 1 ) production in the early universe , stimulated by supersymmetric dark matter particle decays during big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite ; and ( 2 ) production during the virialization and baryonic accretion of large - scale structures , which generates cosmological shocks @xcite that can in turn accelerate a population of cosmological cosmic rays ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * but see @xcite for constraints ) .",
    "the 6 plateau is @xmath60 , and thus whatever its source is , it will not be able to account for the factor @xmath61 discrepancy between @xmath49 and @xmath58 we have found .",
    "however , the existence of the 6 plateau at the 10% level of the solar abundance for metallicities @xmath62 \\la -1 $ ] , can be used as a constraint to any non - standard 6 source that is expected to account for the potentially missing @xmath63 of @xmath49 . moreover , 6 plateau would indicate that such a source would have to become important only at late times , and near - solar metallicities .",
    "we note that another additional source of 6 could come from a population of crs having low energies ( @xmath64 mev ) .",
    "such particles are excluded from the solar system and hence not directly constrained observationally .",
    "a large flux of such particles , well above the extrapolated observed high - energy trends , could produce large additional amounts of 6 but no pions and hence no pionic @xmath4-rays .",
    "indeed , recent observations of @xmath65 in molecular clouds @xcite seem to demand a large low - energy cr flux in the neighborhood of these clouds . on the other hand ,",
    "low - energy crs widespread enough to participate significantly in libeb nucleosynthesis on galactic scales face strong constraints that come from energetics @xcite and from libeb abundance ratios @xcite .",
    "these limits are evaded if solar 6 reflects a localized low - energy cr enhancement , either due to a hypernova - like type ic supernova @xcite , or to solar cr production in the protosolar nebula ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in either case",
    ", the other 7beb isotopes will be produced and constrain the allowable 6 contribution .    in this work",
    "we have assumed that the milky way cr fluence can be approximated with the cosmic mean .",
    "therefore , our result might indicate that more 6 was produced than @xmath4-rays would suggest , which would be the case if the milky way cr flux was at some time(s ) a factor of @xmath66 ( on average ) higher than the typical cr flux in a normal galaxy .",
    "if indeed 6 points to enhanced cr activity , this in turn would point to anomalies in milky way star formation and/or cr properties .",
    "we have assumed that the cr fluence here is typical of the mean star - forming galaxy ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "if instead our galaxy had a more vigorous cr history , this could account for the difference .",
    "also , we have in our most realistic assessment used the present _ local _ cosmic - ray / star - formation ratio @xmath68 ; if this departs from the cosmic mean , this too could account for the 6 discrepancy . both of these solutions have implications for ( and quantify ) the utility of the milky way and local group as representative cosmological samples of star forming galaxies .",
    "upcoming gamma - ray experiments will go far to clarify the nature of galactic and extragalactic pionic gamma - rays , and hence 6 production .",
    "_ glast _ could detect the pionic @xmath4-ray signature from diffuse galactic emission as well as in the egrb ; this would remove the need to estimate these components . _",
    "glast _ should also detect several local group galaxies and thus allow for new determinations of the cosmic - ray / star - formation scaling @xcite .",
    "also , our calculation is hampered by lack of evidence of the `` pion bump '' in the milky way @xmath4-ray spectrum .",
    "fortunately , it was recently demonstrated that future gev  tev ",
    "pev gamma - ray observations of the diffuse emission from the galactic plane can determine the level of pionic @xmath4-ray emission in the milky way @xcite .    in closing",
    ", we have underscored the increasing crucial role that 6 plays in particle astrophysics and cosmology ; the excess we find in solar 6 has implications throughout these fields .",
