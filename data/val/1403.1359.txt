    "the nuclear symmetry energy ( se ) is the basic regulator of the isospin properties of the neutron rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is expected to affect the neutron skin thickness , the coefficient of the asymmetry energy in bethe - weizsacker formula , e.t.c .",
    "in addition , the density dependence of the se is the main ingredient of the equation of state of neutron rich nuclear matter .",
    "actually there is a variety of neutron star properties which are sensitive to se , that is the maximum mass value and the corresponding radius , the onset of the direct urca process , the crust - core transition density and pressure e.t.c .",
    "@xcite    recently , there is an extended theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite interest to constrain the slope of the symmetry energy @xmath5 close to the value of the saturation density @xmath6 of nuclear matter .",
    "both , theoretical and experimental efforts are focused on the study of a possible correlation of @xmath7 with various nuclear properties including the neutron skin thickness , the dipole polarizability and the pygmy dipole resonance of various neutron rich nuclei as well as the analysis of heavy ion collision data . additionally ,",
    "isobaric analog states , nuclei mass formula data and also neutron star observation data are also elaborated .",
    "however , the experimental data for the se still remain limited and only for low values of density ( @xmath8 ) are accurately constrained . from the theoretical point of view",
    "there is an effort to constrain the trend of se , even for low values of density , from finite nuclei properties and to extrapolate in a way to densities related to neutron stars equation of state ( up to @xmath9 ) . in any case , the constraints of @xmath5 or in general the density dependence of se , even for low values of @xmath10 , are very important for astrophysical applications . for example the transition density and pressure between the crust and the core in a neutron star are expected to lie close to the half values of the saturation density @xmath6 and consequently similar to the finite nuclei interior densities @xcite .",
    "the structure of a heavy nucleus is a result of the interplay between the strong short range nuclear forces and long range coulomb interaction .",
    "however , in order to exhibit the isovector character of nuclear forces , we have to focus mainly on heavy and additional neutron rich nuclei .",
    "furthermore it is well known that the energy density formalism is able to reproduce properties of finite nuclei including mainly the bulk properties , namely the binding energy as well as the size and shape of the mass and charge distributions @xcite . in view of the above statements , in the present work we employ a variational approach on a suitably constructed energy density functional .",
    "special attention is devoted to the contribution of the nuclear symmetry energy and the self - consistent treatment of the coulomb interaction .",
    "the symmetry energy is suitably parameterized .",
    "actually the present approach can be easily extended to include more complicated expressions for the symmetry energy as well as for the energy of the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the key quantity of the present study is the isospin asymmetry function @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the neutron , proton and total number densities respectively ) .",
    "the method has the advantage that the asymmetry function @xmath4 is directly related with the symmetry energy as a consequence of the variational principle .",
    "it is expected that the various isovector properties of nuclei ( neutron skin thickness , symmetry energy coefficient e.t.c . )",
    "depend on the trend of the symmetry energy for densities close to the interior of the nucleus .",
    "the motivation of the present work is twofold .",
    "firstly we tried to construct a self - consistent and easily applicable density functional method to study the effect of the symmetry energy on the isovector structure properties of medium and heavy neutron rich nuclei . secondly , our aim is , if it is possible , to combine our theoretical estimation with the relevant experimental or empirical data in order to suggest constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy for densities close to those of the interior of finite nuclei .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we review the density functional method and the variational approach employed for calculating the bulk properties of various neutron rich nuclei .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iii , while sec .",
    "iv summarizes the present study .",
    "according to the empirical bethe - weizsacker formula the binding energy of a finite nucleus with a nucleons and atomic number z is given by @xmath15 the first term corresponds to the volume effect , the second is the surface term , the third one takes into account the coulomb repulsion of the protons , while the fourth is the symmetry energy term .",
    "finally , the last term corresponds to other factors including the pairing interaction e.t.c . using fits of known masses to this equation",
    "one can determine the corresponding coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the energy density functional is a natural extension of the above formula , where now the total energy is a functional of the proton and neutron densities and consists of terms corresponding with those appearing in relation ( [ b - w ] ) .",
    "the minimization of the total energy defines the related densities and consequently the contribution of each term separately . in the present work",
    "we apply the energy density formalism , where the total energy of finite nuclei is a functional of the total density @xmath20 and the isospin asymmetry function @xmath4 , that is @xmath21=\\int_{\\cal v}{\\cal e}\\left(\\rho(r),\\alpha(r)\\right)d^3r , \\label{edf-1}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 is the local energy density .",
    "the integration is performed over the total volume @xmath23 occupied by the relevant nuclei .",

    "the second term @xmath29 is the gradient term corresponding to the contribution originating from the finite size character of the density distribution with @xmath30 being a parameter in the interval @xmath31 mev . in the present work we consider that @xmath32 mev .",
    "the third term corresponds to the coulomb energy density where the coulomb potential @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34 and must satisfy also the poisson equation @xmath35 eq .",
    "( [ pios-1 ] ) is used to check the convergence of the iteration process involved in such a kind of calculations .",
    "finally the density @xmath20 and the asymmetry function @xmath4 must obey the following constraints @xmath36 the functional ( [ funt-1 ] ) and the constraints ( [ constr-1 ] ) after some algebra are written as @xmath24=4\\pi \\int_0^{\\infty } r^2 \\left [ \\epsilon_{anm}(\\rho(r),\\alpha(r))+f_0\\left(\\frac{d\\rho}{dr}\\right)^2+\\frac{1}{4}\\rho(1-\\alpha)v_c(r ) \\right ] dr \\label{funt-3-coul}\\ ] ] and @xmath37 eqs .",

    "however , the expression ( [ dif-2-c ] ) does not ensure the above constraints , since for high values of @xmath51 ( low values of @xmath20 and consequently @xmath28 ) @xmath4 increases very fast and there is a cut - off radius , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and also @xmath54 .    in order to overcome this unphysical behavior of @xmath4 we use the assumption @xmath55 accordingly",

    "we get @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the part of the spherical volume of the nucleus for the radius @xmath52 .",
    "the cut - off radius @xmath52 , which reflects the combined effect of the symmetry energy and coulomb energy on the asymmetry function @xmath4 according to expression ( [ dif-2-c ] ) , easily can be determined by solving the equation @xmath61 finally from the equations ( [ resip-2 ] ) , ( [ lm-2 ] ) and ( [ rc-1 ] ) we see that the asymmetry function @xmath4 is @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 . in eq .",

    "the corresponding constants are : @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath28 can be suitably expanded around the saturation density @xmath6 as follows @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the value of the symmetry energy at the saturation density and @xmath79 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath80 is related with the slope of the symmetry energy at @xmath6 , while the coefficient @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 .",
    "there are various suggested expressions for the symmetry energy in the literature .",

    "however , recent studies conjecture that @xmath107 is a strong indicator of the isospin character of the nuclear interaction expected to be strongly correlated with the symmetry energy slope @xmath5 and the value @xmath85 or in general with the values of the symmetry energy close to the saturation density .",
    "we employ a variational approach to study the effect of the symmetry energy on isovector properties of various medium and heavy nuclei . the method ,",
    "even its simplicity , has the advantage that the dependence of the asymmetry function @xmath4 on the symmetry energy , and the coulomb potential , are introduced explicitly .",
    "more specifically , the total energy density of the nucleus consists of the nuclear and coulomb contributions .",
    "the nuclear term consists of two parts i.e. the symmetric nuclear matter and also the asymmetry energy one . in order to be able to study the effects of the symmetry energy we parameterized suitably the related expression .",
    "we study the dependence of the neutron skin thickness @xmath107 and the asymmetry coefficient @xmath19 on the slope @xmath5 of the se at the saturation density @xmath6 . in the present method",
    "the asymmetry function @xmath4 is treated as a variational function and the total density @xmath20 as a trial function . for each @xmath20 the corresponding @xmath4 and the total energy",
    "are found .",
    "the process continues up to find the function @xmath10 which minimizes the total energy .",
    "all the relevant quantities , which are functionals of @xmath20 , @xmath4 and @xmath28 , are easily calculated .",
    "the outline of our approach is the following : we start from the general relation @xmath108 which gives an averaged estimate of the nuclear radius and accordingly we consider a fermi form for the total density distribution @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "afterwards , for a fixed @xmath20 the asymmetry function is rearranged accordingly so that the total energy of the nucleus is the lowest one .",
    "it is worth to point out , following the discussion by brueckner et.al .",
    "@xcite that the energy density functional ( [ funt-1 ] ) breaks down at the edge of the nucleus for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the thomas - fermi approximation , which is the basis of the present work , fails for low densities .",
    "secondly at the edge of the nucleus the asymmetry function @xmath4 tends to unity and the potential contribution to the total energy functional is not accurate .    in fig .  1 ,",
    "the symmetry energy versus the total density is plotted , according to eq .",
    "( [ esym-1 ] ) for various values of the slope parameter @xmath5 .",
    "it is noted that lower values of @xmath5 correspond to higher values of @xmath28 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath28 is well reflected on the values of the total binding energy @xmath109 and the asymmetry function @xmath4 .",
    "more precisely , higher values of @xmath5 lead to lower contribution of the @xmath28 on the total binding energy and consequently the nucleons become more bound .",
    "for example in table i are presented the results ( concerning the total binding energy @xmath109 , the proton @xmath103 and neutron @xmath102 rms radii , the neutron skin @xmath107 and the asymmetry coefficient @xmath19 ) for the nucleus @xmath0pb for the case @xmath110 mev and for @xmath111 .",
    "in addition , since the values of the density distribution inside the nucleus are lower than the value of the saturation density @xmath112 @xmath73 , it is concluded that the isovector properties of nuclei are related with the trend of the symmetry energy in the region @xmath113 and vice - versa , that is the experimental isovector measurements give information for the lower part of the se .    in fig .  2 we plot the density distributions ( total , proton and neutron ) as well as the corresponding asymmetry function @xmath4 for various values of @xmath5 and two nuclei ( @xmath0pb and @xmath3ca . ) the softness symmetry energy ( higher values of @xmath5 ) shift the neutron distribution to the outer part of the nucleus , while at the same time it concentrates deeper the protons .",
    "this is clearly reflected both on the corresponding values of @xmath103 and @xmath102 as well as on the neutron skin @xmath107 ( see also table i ) .",
    "the effects of the symmetry energy is even more pronounced on the trend of the asymmetry function .",
    "higher values of @xmath5 shift the cut - off radius @xmath52 to even more lower values increasing dramatically the neutron skin and forming a kind of _ neutron halo _ inside the nucleus .",
    "it is obvious from the above analysis that @xmath28 and consequently , according to expression ( [ asym - final ] ) , the asymmetry function @xmath4 acts as a _ regulator _ on the proton and neutron distributions in order to minimize , in every case , the total energy of the nucleus . on the other hand , and",
    "accordingly(see also expression ( [ asym - final ] ) ) the coulomb potential @xmath33 acts inversely , compared to @xmath28 and its main effect is to shift the proton distribution to the outer part of the nucleus .",
    "actually , the interplay between the long range coulomb forces , the nuclear forces and mainly the isovector part of nuclear forces is responsible for the creation of the neutron skin thickness .",
    "however , although the coulomb contribution is well defined , the contribution of the symmetry energy still remains an open problem even for low values of densities .",
    "3 displays the neutron skin @xmath107 as a function of @xmath5 for various values of @xmath85 for the four studied neutron rich nuclei ( @xmath0pb , @xmath1sn , @xmath2zr and @xmath3ca ) .",
    "the most striking feature is , in all cases , the strong dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath5 . for a comparison ,",
    "we include for the case of @xmath0pb an approximate linear dependence @xmath114 established by centelles _",
    "@xcite using a wide range of non - relativistic and relativistic models .",
    "it is obvious that relation ( [ approx - roca ] ) supports a softer dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath5 compared to the present study .",
    "however we note that we present a systematic study of the effects of @xmath5 on @xmath107 and in a large range of values of @xmath5 without trying to reproduce for example the experimental value of the binding energy or the charge radius of the specific nucleus . even in this case",
    ", we found that the intersection between our results and the results compatible with ( [ approx - roca ] ) corresponds to values of binding energy very close to the experimental for the specific nuclei .",
    "very recently the lead radius experiment ( prex ) at the jefferson laboratory has provided the first model - independent evidence for the existence of a neutron - rich skin in @xmath0pb @xcite .",
    "the determined neutron skin was @xmath115fm .",
    "however such a large error is not enough to constrain the various nuclear models .",
    "in addition the large determined neutron skin ( compared to previous experimental measurements ) creates a new open problem concerning the correlation between the nuclear equation of state of nuclear matter and the density functional theory in finite nuclei ( see for a pertinent discussion in @xcite ) .    in fig .",
    "4 we display the coefficients @xmath19 as a function of @xmath5 , for various values of @xmath85 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath19 is a decreasing function of @xmath5 .",
    "actually , for specific pairs of values of @xmath116 and @xmath117 , and according to bethe - weizsacker formula ( [ b - w ] ) , a softer @xmath28 ( high values of @xmath5 ) leads to a lower value of @xmath4 ( a property directly connected with the contribution of the symmetry energy to the total energy ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath19 exhibits a mass depended @xmath118 behavior .    in order to impose some possible constraints on the values of @xmath5 , we plot in fig .",
    "5(a ) for each of the four nuclei @xmath0pb , @xmath1sn , @xmath2zr , and @xmath3ca the pairs of @xmath5 and @xmath85 consistent with the corresponding empirical values of @xmath19 determined by the formula @xcite @xmath119 where we use for the volume and surface coefficients @xmath120 mev and @xmath121 mev respectively .",
    "it is seen in fig .",
    "5(a ) that the set @xmath122 mev and @xmath123 mev reproduces very well the empirical values of @xmath19 for almost all the medium and heavy isotopes .",
    "two important features of the relation between @xmath5 and @xmath85 are useful .",
    "first , the inequality @xmath124 holds approximately .",
    "this means that a change of @xmath125 mev in the value of @xmath85 results in a corresponding change @xmath126 mev .",
    "that is according to the present approach the accuracy on the measurements of @xmath19 and @xmath85 will impose strong constraints on the values of @xmath5 .",
    "second , since the four almost linear curves are arranged very close with a similar slope , we may conjecture that a possible universal dependence holds between @xmath5 and @xmath85 for nuclei at least in the mass region a=40 - 200 .",
    "that means that the same set of @xmath5 and @xmath85 , related with nuclear symmetry energy , reproduce in a very good accuracy the symmetry energy coefficient for medium as well as heavy nuclei . especially for values of @xmath85 and @xmath5 in the region @xmath127 mev and @xmath128 mev",
    "respectively the accuracy is high .    in addition , in fig .",
    "5(b ) we present the mass dependence of the coefficient @xmath19 of a several isotopes of ca , zr , sn and pb , for two sets of @xmath5 and @xmath85 . for a comparison",
    "we include also the formula ( [ fit - daniel ] ) .",
    "the first set ( @xmath129 mev and @xmath130 mev ) reproduces on the average the binding energies of the corresponding isotopes while the second set ( @xmath122 mev and @xmath123 mev ) as we mentioned above , reproduces on the average the empirical values of @xmath19 for the isotopes @xmath0pb , @xmath1sn , @xmath2zr , and @xmath3ca .    in fig .",
    "6 we compare the allowed pairs of @xmath5 and @xmath85 constrained from heavy - ion collisions and nuclear structure observable @xcite with those found in the present approach . actually the present results lie inside the intersection area suggested by the measurements of the dipole polarizability @xmath131 as well as those found by heavy - ion collisions experiments .",
    "however , they lie outside the interval constrained by the nuclear masses measurements , connected with the binding energy , but only for @xmath132 mev .",
    "this is due to the fact that constraints between @xmath5 and @xmath85 are based on the adjustment of the theoretical to the empirical value of the asymmetry coefficient @xmath19 and not on the corresponding experimental values of the binding energies .",
    "it is remarkable that the allowed pairs of @xmath5 and @xmath85 consistent with our approach ( seethe colored lines in fig .",
    "6 ) lie at the intersection of the bands originating from other approaches @xcite .",
    "7(a ) exhibits the dependence of the coefficient @xmath19 on the asymmetry parameter @xmath133 for various isotopes , for the cases @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in almost all cases there",
    "is a soft dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath136 but , as expected , a strong dependence on the value of @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , in fig .",
    "7(b ) we indicate the dependence of the neutron skin on the asymmetry parameter @xmath136 .",
    "the most characteristic trend is the occurrence of strong and linear dependence of @xmath107 on @xmath136 that is @xmath137 where the constants @xmath138 and @xmath139 vary in the intervals @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "of course those intervals are strongly dependent on the specific set of values of @xmath5 and @xmath85 . for a comparison a similar relation suggested in @xcite is presented @xmath142 although in a number of analyzed cases the statistical errors are rather large .    in any case , additional experimental work is necessary to constrain the neutron skin @xcite .",
    "in particular the upcoming lead radius experiment ii ( prex - ii ) promises to determine the neutron - skin thickness of @xmath0pb with a @xmath143 fm accuracy while the calcium radius experiment ( crex ) will provide a high precision measurement for the neutron radius of @xmath3ca with accuracy @xmath144 fm @xcite .",
    "the above measurements will be a very good test for all the theoretical models including the present variational approach .",
    "in the present work we employ a variational method , in the framework of the local density approximation , in order to study the symmetry energy effects on isovector properties of various neutron rich nuclei .",
    "the key quantity of the present approximation is the asymmetry function @xmath4 naturally computed by the variational principle .",
    "actually , @xmath4 is a functional both of the symmetry energy as well as the coulomb potential , it contains the interplay between the long - range coulomb forces and short - range nuclear ones and it defines the density distribution of neutrons and protons .",
    "all the calculated properties are studied as a function of the slope of the symmetry energy and the value of the symmetry energy at the nuclear saturation density .",
    "since , the se even for low values of nuclear matter is uncertain , the above parameterization is necessary .",
    "we find that the neutron skin thickness is very sensitive to @xmath5 i.e. it increases rapidly with @xmath5 .",
    "this is expected at least in the present approximation , since the main ingredient of the relevant calculated integrals , the function @xmath4 approaches unity very rapidly close to the critical value of @xmath52 ( at the surface of the proton distribution ) .",
    "the above characteristic behavior of @xmath4 is well reflected on the asymmetry coefficient @xmath19 which is a decreasing function of @xmath5 . in the case of @xmath0pb we compare our results with those originating from additional calculations with different models .",
    "we conclude that the present approximation supports a stronger sensitivity of the neutron skin thickness on @xmath5 .",
    "however , constraining the total binding energy to be close to the experimental one we see that our results are very close to the mentioned empirical formula .",
    "our findings , from the present study , show that the experimental knowledge of the symmetry energy at the saturation density @xmath85 will impose , via the values of the symmetry coefficient @xmath19 , strong constraints on @xmath5 .",
    "more specifically , we note that the set @xmath122 , @xmath123 reproduces very well the empirical values of @xmath19 corresponding to the nuclei under consideration . in any case ,",
    "further experimental and theoretical work is necessary for a more detailed exploration of the effects of the symmetry energy on the properties of finite nuclei as well as on the neutron star structure .",
