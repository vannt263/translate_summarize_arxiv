    "novel two - dimensional materials exhibiting promising properties for applications in information technology have been synthesized recently . among them , graphene  @xcite stands out for its versatility and its remarkable electronic and transport properties  @xcite .",

    "a band gap can be induced by doping and/or by nanostructuring , e.g. by fabricating one - dimensional nanoribbons ( nrs )  @xcite .",
    "hexagonal boron nitride ( bn ) mls have been studied intensively too : they display exceptional chemical stability and insulating behavior , with a large band gap of 5.7 ev .",
    "it is also possible to tune the band gap of bn by making nrs with nanometer - sized width .",
    "recently , hexagonal bn - graphene hybrid structures , consisting of domains of bn and graphene , have been synthesized experimentally  @xcite .",
    "these structures exhibit interesting electronic and mechanical properties , which could be exploited in novel , flexible electronic and optical devices .",
    "furthermore , the properties of these systems can be tailored by changing the relative content of bn and graphene .",
    "we refer to these hybrid systems as bn - c .",
    "two - dimensional bc@xmath1n nanostructures have also received theoretical attention  @xcite , although experimental realization has not been reported yet .",
    "some types of bn and graphene nrs have been shown , theoretically , to display extraordinary magnetic properties as well , in that they possess spin polarized edge states : the zigzag graphene nr  @xcite is certainly the most well known nr exhibiting this effect , nevertheless edge magnetism has been predicted to occur in unsaturated bn zigzag nrs  @xcite and hexagonal armchair bc@xmath1n ( bc@xmath1n ) nrs  @xcite too .",
    "however , the stability of edge magnetism is still debated  @xcite and no direct experimental evidence for the presence of magnetic edge states in these systems has been provided yet . for deposited nrs , the interaction with the substrate is a serious concern : recently , we have revealed the absence of edge states in zigzag graphene nrs on ir@xmath0 by a combined density functional theory ( dft ) and scanning tunneling microscopy study  @xcite .",
    "we have also investigated zigzag graphene nrs on the @xmath0 surface of cu , ag and au by dft : our results indicate that these nrs possess edge states , in agreement with recent experiments  @xcite , but do not display edge magnetism , with the exception of h - terminated graphene nrs on au@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite    it has been shown experimentally that cu substrates can be effectively used for the growth of graphene  @xcite and bn  @xcite nanostructures , as well as hybrid bn - c heterostructures  @xcite . here , we present a dft study of bn - c , bn and bc@xmath1n hexagonal mls and nrs on the cu@xmath0 surface , aiming at understanding the effect of this substrate on the structural and electronic properties of the mls and nrs .",
    "we fully relax all the models of the mls and the nrs and determine the most favorable adsorption sites for the b , n and c atoms .",
    "we show that monolayers with alternating domains interact significantly with cu@xmath0 , due to the hybridization of the cu 3d orbitals with states localized at the b - c interfaces . as a result ,",
    "the mls bend considerably so as to form valleys at these interfaces .",
    "the electronic properties of the mls are strongly affected by this interaction too .",
    "bn and bc@xmath1n mls , on the other hand , interact weakly with the substrate . in the case of nrs , we primarily focus on the electronic states and chemical bonding mechanisms responsible for the interaction between the nrs and the surface near the edge .",
    "we show that , in the unpassivated case , the latter interaction is determined by a complex interplay between the hybridization of the d states of the surface cu atoms with a ) the dangling - bond orbitals of the edge atoms and b ) the edge states of the nrs . for passivated nrs ,",
    "the interaction is weaker and involves only the edge states of the nrs .",
    "we also show that , although some of the studied models have magnetic edge states and/or interface states in a free - standing configuration , none of them exhibits significant magnetization at the edge / interface upon deposition on the cu@xmath0 surface .",
    "the structural optimization and the calculation of the electronic properties were carried out using the plane - wave package quantum - espresso  @xcite .",
    "we employed gradient - corrected exchange correlation functionals  @xcite , semi - empirical van der waals corrections  @xcite and ( scalar - relativistic ) ultrasoft pseudopotentials  @xcite .",
    "the use of grimme corrections is crucial , in that plain gga functionals have been shown to yield a negative binding energy between bn sheets and cu@xmath0  @xcite .    in the following description of the models ,",
    "the @xmath2 axis is taken perpendicular to the surface .",
    "we use the same lattice parameter of 2.5  for both bn and graphene .",
    "this value corresponds to the experimental lattice constant for bn ( the experimental parameter for graphene is 2.46  ) .",
    "to investigate the large supercells required to account for the mismatch between cu@xmath0 and graphene or bn is computationally extremely demanding ; for this reason , we used a compressed ( about 3.8 % ) cu lattice to make cu@xmath0 and the mls commensurate .",
    "therefore , the primitive @xmath3 cell of cu@xmath0 was used for bn mls , whereas , for bc@xmath1n mls , a @xmath4 supercell of cu@xmath0 was employed . as regards bn - c heterostructures , we considered two models consisting of a periodic alternation of bn and c stripes . in the first model ( which we denote bn - c@xmath5 in the following ) , bn and c stripes have a width of 4 units of the hexagonal lattice , whereas in the second model ( denoted bn - c@xmath6 ) , the width is equal to 8 units ( see also figure  [ struct_mls ] ) . although the widths of the c and bn domains in our models are much smaller than those reported in recent experiments  @xcite , the models can nevertheless provide important information about the interaction of the bn - c heterostructures with the cu substrate near the interface between different domains .",
    "the @xmath7 axis was taken parallel to the stripes and the @xmath8 axis in the plane and normal to them .",
    "a @xmath9 cu@xmath0 supercell was used for both models .",
    "the cu@xmath0 surface was modeled with slabs consisting of four atomic layers . to separate the periodic images of the models along the @xmath2 direction ,",
    "vacuum layers with thicknesses of 9  at least were used . in ref .",
    "some test calculations employing thicker slabs ( containing up to 12 layers ) were performed for graphene nrs on cu@xmath0 .",
    "these calculations showed that 4-layer slabs are sufficient to describe the interaction between the nrs and the cu surface , which makes us confident that the same holds true for the models studied in this work .",
    "we considered a zigzag termination for all the models of the nrs except the bc@xmath1n systems , for which the armchair termination was studied .",
    "both h - free and singly h - terminated nrs were investigated .",
    "we considered bn and bc@xmath1n nrs with a width of 8 unit cells of the honeycomb lattice .",
    "the @xmath7 axis was taken parallel to the nrs . @xmath10 and @xmath11 supercells of cu@xmath0 were employed for bn and bc@xmath1n nrs respectively , corresponding to distances between nearest - neighbor periodic images of the nrs of at least 14  .",
    "two models of bn - c nrs were also considered .",
    "both models were ended with bn stripes at the two edges .",
    "the two nrs consist of three stripes ( bn - c - bn ) and five stripes ( bn - c - bn - c - bn ) respectively .",
    "the widths of the stripes at the edges are equal to four and two units of the honeycomb lattice , whereas the widths of the stripes in the center coincide with those of the two models of bn - c mls discussed above .",

    "@xmath12 monkhorst - pack meshes  @xcite were used to perform the integration over the brillouin zone for all the models of nrs . + all of the atoms of the nrs and the mls , as well as the two topmost cu layers , were allowed to relax during structural optimization .",

    "in fact , these corrections seem to lead to slight overbinding in the case of bn mls on cu@xmath0  @xcite . hence , the obtained values of the ml - cu@xmath0 distances might deviate from the experimental ones .",
    "the band gaps of the bn and bc@xmath1n mls are equal to 4.63 ev and 1.62 ev respectively .",

    "<S> recently , two - dimensional nanostructures consisting of alternating graphene and boron nitride ( bn ) domains have been synthesized . </S>",
    "<S> these systems possess interesting electronic and mechanical properties , with potential applications in electronics and optical devices . here </S>",
    "<S> , we perform a first - principles investigation of models of bn - c hybrid monolayers and nanoribbons deposited on the cu@xmath0 surface , a substrate used for their growth in said experiments . for the sake of comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also consider bn and bc@xmath1n nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> we show that bn and bc@xmath1n monolayers bind weakly to cu@xmath0 , whereas monolayers with alternating domains interact strongly with the substrate at the b - c interface , due to the presence of localized interface states . </S>",
    "<S> this binding leads to a deformation of the monolayers and sizable n - doping . </S>",
    "<S> nanoribbons exhibit a similar behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , they also interact significantly with the substrate at the edge , even in the case of passivated edges . </S>",
    "<S> these findings suggest a route to tune the band gap and doping level of bn - c hybrid models based on the interplay between nanostructuring and substrate - induced effects . </S>"
