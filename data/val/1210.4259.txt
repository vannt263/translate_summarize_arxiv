    "observable parameters of binary millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , e.g. mass of the pulsar , mass of the companion , spin period , orbital period , eccentricity , etc . , are used to probe the past accretion history of the msps .",
    "the purpose of this proceeding is to demonstrate how to infer some of the observable quantities ( spin period , magnetic field and mass ) during the accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a white dwarf ( wd ) on its way to become a member of the msp family .",
    "we are able to determine the spin period of msps originating from wds .",
    "the process begins with simple keplerian frequency .",
    "we assume that the angular velocity of the ns is equal to the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath0 , of the magnetosphere , at roughly the alfv@xmath1n surface , @xmath2 from which we obtain the spin of the msp , @xmath3 , as a function of the wd spin , @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 where @xmath6 is the minimum spin period of the standard wd ( * ? ? ? * ( warner 1995 ) ) . assuming @xmath6 @xmath7 s , @xmath8 km and @xmath9 km",
    ", we thus obtain , @xmath10 fig . 1 ( left ) shows the observed and derived spin period distributions of msps . as for the observed msps , they show a relatively gaussian distribution . according to these distributions ,",
    "the ratio of msps originating from cvs is about @xmath11 .",
    "this result agrees with some theoretical predictions such as those by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to investigate the correlation between the magnetic fields of msps with bottom fields of cvs ( where the field is partially restructured due to accretion ) , we follow the model of @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux is assumed to be conserved .",
    "this corresponds to the magnetic fields produced by aic .",
    "@xmath12 if we adopt @xmath13 = @xmath14  cm and @xmath15 g in cvs , the minimum value , @xmath16",
    "the sample of cvs whose masses we have considered is the set of binary systems collected by @xcite . among them",
    "we have 26 massive cvs in the range @xmath17 .",
    "1 ( right ) shows the relatively gaussian distribution , with mean at @xmath18 .",
    "a summary of the known properties of these systems is given in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "note that the aic process leads to a msp with mass less than chandrasekhar limit @xcite .",
    "this provides evidence for the aic in massive cvs and evolutionary hypotheses of msp birthrate .",
    "1 .   cvs would be invoked via the capability of producing a significant portion of the msps via the aic process , a regime which may be unattainable by normal channels .",
    "we find that the quantitative implications of our calculations are that we estimate the expected @xmath19 in the observed of msps which could have originated from cvs to be @xmath11 .",
    "we further find that the predictions of some parameters after aic process for the average levels are consistent with the observed msp population .",
    "future work will consider other quantities e.g. orbital period , eccentricity , and mass ratio ( q ) using more data sets from sdss ."
