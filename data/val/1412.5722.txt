    "# 1 # 1    the existence of a neutron stars have been confirmed observationally , and the measured masses and radii of neutron stars have been used to partially constrain the physical properties of the dense nuclear matter .",
    "so far , about 70 nss have been observed and their distribution in mass has been accumulated according to their binary types @xcite . in the x - ray / optical binaries ,",
    "the mean and error - weighted mean of ns mass distribution are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , which implies that the measurement errors are relatively large .",
    "the ns - white dwarf binaries have similar precision in the mass distribution to that of the x - ray / optical binaries ; the mean and error - weighted mean are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , the ns - ns binaries show relatively stable statistics ; the mean and error - weighted mean are @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in all of these binaries , the mean masses do not exceed @xmath10 , and one may conclude that most of ns masses lie in the range of @xmath11 , which can be regarded as a canonical range of ns masses . note that nss with larger masses have relatively larger measurement errors except for a few exceptions for the large ns masses , which were measured with high accuracy , e.g. , psr j1614 - 2230 , @xmath12 @xcite and psr j0348 + 0432 , @xmath13 @xcite .    by solving the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation",
    ", one can see that the ns with large mass can have a high - density region in the core , providing a room for the existence of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom such as hyperons , bose - einstein condensation , free quark phase and etc .",
    "these exotic states relieve the pressure exerted by the fermionic nature of nucleons , make the equation of state ( eos ) soft , and eventually reduce the mass of ns . among diverse possibilities ,",
    "hyperons have been playing a key role in reducing the maximum mass of ns to the canonical range .",
    "however , recent observations of nss with @xmath12 and @xmath13 initiate a challenge to the existence of hyperons at the core of ns ( so called  hyperon puzzle \" ) .    in order to solve the hyperon puzzle ,",
    "some studies based upon both relativistic and non - relativistic mean field ( rmf and nrmf , respectively ) models have been conducted so far .",
    "the modern version of these models shows great accuracy in reproducing the properties of known nuclei .",
    "however , the maximum mass of ns calculated with these models shows drastic fluctuations , ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 even without including any hyperon yet @xcite .",
    "main uncertainty comes from the extrapolation of models to the high density where no experimental data available .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the @xmath16 ns from psr j1614 - 2230 and psr j0348 + 0432 can rule out some of rmf or nrmf models that predict the maximum mass less than @xmath3 .",
    "when the effect of hyperons is included in the rmf models , the coupling constants of hyperons are fitted to the depth of hyperon - nucleus optical potentials at the nuclear saturation density in most of the rmf models .",
    "( note that the hyperon - nucleus optical potentials are obtained from the single - strangeness hypernuclei . ) with this method , the rmf models show the similar effect of hyperons on ns mass regardless of the differences among various rmf models ; the mass of ns is depending on the background nuclear models @xcite . in order to solve the hyperon puzzle , some recent works introduced repulsive forces caused by the vector - meson exchange in the rmf models @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by assuming a hard core of hyperons , one of the authors ( chh ) obtained the maximum mass of ns close to @xmath3 .",
    "however , the parameterization used in these approaches is not directly compatible with hypernuclear data and relies partly on the theoretical arguments .",
    "dealing with the interactions between hyperons is in a worse situation because of statistically insufficient data from the double - hypernuclei experiments . in most cases ,",
    "the coupling constants between hyperons are determined from the symmetry arguments .",
    "the coupling constants obtained in this manner show very minor effects on the mass of ns @xcite , so in many works the interactions between hyperons are justified to be omitted for simplicity .",
    "the purpose of this work is to explore the effect of the @xmath1 interactions on the eos and the resulting bulk properties of ns by employing a few skyrme - type models and a finite - range model that reproduce the empirical binding energies of the double-@xmath17 hypernuclei . for the nucleon and single-@xmath17 interactions and the nucleon - nucleon interactions",
    ", we also use the skyrme - type models that are consistent with the experimental data .",
    "we find that our results with these models turn out to be quite different from those of the rmf models , suggesting a possible solution to the hyperon puzzle .",
    "we find that some of our models both predict the maximum mass of @xmath3 and are in good agreement with the observationally - constrained mass - radius relation @xcite .",
    "we organize this paper as follows .",
    "ii explains the skyrme - type models for the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath18 ) interactions and the nucleon-@xmath17 ( @xmath0 ) interactions .",
    "as mentioned above , we use both the skyrme - type models and a finite - range force model for the @xmath1 interactions . sect .",
    "ii also contains some details of these models . sect .",
    "iii is devoted to the results about the properties of ns matter , and the consequent mass - radius relation of ns .",
    "we summarize our work and give some discussions in sect .",
    "we employ the standard skyrme - type forces for the @xmath18 interactions given in the form @xmath19 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + t_2(1+x_2 p_\\sigma ) \\bm{k}'_{ij } \\cdot \\delta(\\bm{r}_{ij } ) \\bm{k}_{ij } + \\frac{1}{6 } t_3(1+x_3",

    "we choose three models sly4 , ski4 , and sgi for the parameters of @xmath18 interactions . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , these models are in reasonable agreement with the mass - radius constraints of the observed ns presented in ref .",
    "the basic properties of the models are summarized in table [ tab : nnforce ] .",
    "we note that the models also satisfy the maximum mass constraints given by psr j1614 - 2230 or psr j0348 + 0432 .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to see the effect of inconsistent combination of interaction models , we evaluate the difference of ns maximum mass with and without @xmath1 forces .",
    "table  [ tab : diff ] summarizes the result where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is defined as the difference of ns maximum mass between with and without s@xmath39 ( s@xmath40 ) interactions .",
    "parentheses denote the ns maximum mass for given @xmath18 and @xmath41 interactions .",
    "all the values in the table are in the unit of solar mass @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath18 force models give significant variation for the ns maximum mass , and the selected @xmath0 forces show the reduction of the maximum mass in the range of @xmath42 .",
    "inspite of this strong dependence on the @xmath18 and @xmath0 interactions , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are lesser sensitive to the @xmath1 force models .",
    "we note that the s@xmath39 models are fitted to skm@xmath45 and ybz5 models for @xmath18 and @xmath0 interactions , respectively , so all the @xmath37 values are results of inconsistent model combinations .",
    "nevertheless , the contribution of @xmath1 interaction is not much affected by the inconsistency .",
    "right part of the table presents the result of @xmath38 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , skm@xmath45 and ybz4 models are used to fit the @xmath1 interactions , so @xmath38 values in the column of skm@xmath45 are the results of consistent use of interaction models .",
    "similar to @xmath37 , ns maximum mass shows dependence on the @xmath1 interaction at the order of @xmath46 .",
    "the reason for this weak dependence on the @xmath1 interaction can be found from the energy density in eq .",
    "( [ eq : endenll ] ) , and the fraction of @xmath17 hyperons in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac ] .",
    "first , since @xmath47 in the @xmath1 forces , the contribution of @xmath1 interactions to the eos is determined by @xmath48 , @xmath49 and the density of @xmath17 hyperon @xmath50 .",
    "second , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac ] , fraction of @xmath17 hyperons at the maximum mass density ( denoted by circles in the figure ) is similar to each other among different @xmath41 interactions . with similar @xmath17 hyperon fraction at the center of ns where tov equation is started to be integrated , the contribution of @xmath1 interaction is dominantly controlled by @xmath48 and @xmath49 values .",
    "therefore , a @xmath1 interaction model gives similar contribution to the ns maximum mass with little dependence on the @xmath18 and @xmath0 interactions .",
    "some errors are inevitable due to the inconsistent combination of @xmath18 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions , but it is unlikely to affect or change the conclusion of this work significantly .",
    "another limitation of the current work arises from the omission of @xmath51 and @xmath52 hyperons .",
    "some recent works @xcite consider the role of these hyperons , and the results turn out to be sensitive to the hyperon - nucleon potentials .",
    "due to the lack of sufficient experimental data , the contributions of @xmath51 and @xmath52 hyperons are more uncertain than the those of @xmath17 hyperon . though our investigation is not complete at this moment in the aspect of the self - consistent application of models and the full account of exotic degrees of freedom , we expect that these two effects are not large enough to alter the conclusion of this work . however , it is still worth continuing to investigate them in the future studies .",
