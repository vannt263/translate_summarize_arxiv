    "the first extrasolar planetary system consisting of three planets orbiting a neutron star , the 6.2-ms radio pulsar psr b1257 + 12 , has been systematically observed since the time of its discovery @xcite .",
    "pulsar planets comprise the only known system of terrestrial - mass planets beyond the sun .",
    "they exhibit a striking dynamical similarity to the inner solar system @xcite .",
    "the pulsar planets have also provided the first demonstration of orbital near resonance in an extrasolar planetary system with the resulting , measurable gravitational perturbations @xcite . in the recent years , a variety of resonances and commensurabilities have been detected in planetary systems around normal stars @xcite .",
    "a microsecond precision of the pulsar timing offers a possibility to detect additional , even lower mass planets around psr b1257 + 12 and other neutron stars observable as radio pulsars @xcite    an accurate knowledge of masses and orbital inclinations of the psr b1257 + 12 planets is critically important for our understanding of the origin and evolution of this unique planetary system . in this case",
    ", the near 3:2 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) between planets b and c in the pulsar system and the existence of detectable gravitational perturbations between the two planets @xcite provide the mechanism to derive their masses without an a priori knowledge of orbital inclinations . an approximate analytical model which includes the effect of gravitational interactions between planets b and c has been published by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have developed a new semi - analytical model in which perturbations between the two planets are parametrized in terms of the two planetary masses and the mutual orientation of the orbits with a sufficient precision to make a practical application of this approach feasible . using the simulated data , they have demonstrated that the planet masses and hence their orbital inclinations can be derived from a least - squares fit of this model to the pulse times - of - arrival ( toa ) measurements spanning a sufficiently long period of time .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the results of putting this model to a practical test by applying it to the toa measurements of psr b1257 + 12 made with the 305-m arecibo telescope over a 12-year period between 1990 and 2003 . in section 2",
    ", we present a brief summary of the timing model published by @xcite .",
    "section 3 contains the description of arecibo timing measurements of psr b1257 + 12 and the details and results of data analysis .",
    "consequences of our successful determination of masses and orbital inclinations of planets b and c in the psr b1257 + 12 system and future prospects for new pulsar planet detections are discussed in section 4 .",
    "as the first approximation , the orbits of the psr b1257 + 12 system can be described in terms of the sum of the keplerian motions of its planets , in which case the direct and indirect gravitational interactions between planets are negligible . however , as predicted by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the 3:2 commensurability of the orbital periods of planets b and c does lead to observable deviations from the simple keplerian model @xcite .    in the classical approach",
    ", such departures from the keplerian dynamics can be described by means of the so - called osculating orbital elements by invoking the keplerian orbital elements that are no longer constant but they change in time due to mutual interactions between planets . for psr b1257 + 12 timing ,",
    "the difficulty with this approach is that only a radial component of the spatial motion of the pulsar can be measured and a complete information on the orientation of orbits of the planets is not available .",
    "below , we summarize an approach developed by @xcite that addresses this problem and allows to accurately calculate the osculating elements of planetary orbits in the presence of gravitational perturbations .    in the new timing model , we define the toa variations @xmath5 as a sum of the two components @xmath6 here , @xmath7 describes the toa variations due to the keplerian part of the motion and is a function of the instantaneous values of the keplerian elements of planets at the moment @xmath8 . for a @xmath9-th planet , these are the projected semi - major axis of the pulsar orbit @xmath10 , eccentricity @xmath11 , longitude of the periastron @xmath12 , orbital period @xmath13 , and time of the periastron passage @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the second term in eqn . ( 1 ) , @xmath15 , describes the toa variations caused by changes in the osculating orbital elements , @xmath16 .",
    "these variables are functions of masses of the pulsar and the planets and of the relative geometry of the orbits .    in the model , the masses are expressed in terms of two parameters , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 are the masses of the two planets and the pulsar , respectively . as shown in @xcite , geometry of the orbits",
    "can be described in terms of a relative position of the node of the orbits , @xmath20 , if their relative inclination is small ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is related to the longitudes of the ascending nodes , @xmath22 , and the orbital inclinations @xmath23 through the following set of equations ( see also fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath24 as long as the above small - angle approvimation is valid , the parameters @xmath25 , and @xmath20 represent an accurate description of the time evolution of the osculating orbital elements . consequently , eqn .",
    "( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath26 to define , in general terms , a modified timing model which includes familiar quantities , @xmath27 , to parametrize keplerian orbits and introduces three additional parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath20 , to account for the perturbations between planets b and c. the correctness of this approach has been verified by extensive simulations described by @xcite .",
    "psr b1257 + 12 has been observed with the arecibo telescope since its discovery in 1990 @xcite . in the years 1990 - 1994 , before the arecibo upgrade , the pulsar had been timed at 430 mhz and 1400 mhz with the princeton mark - iii backend that utilizes two 32-channel filterbanks ( for a description see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . starting in 1994 , just before the beginning of the arecibo upgrade , the pulsar had also been timed with a 128-channel filterbank - based penn state pulsar machine ( pspm ; *",
    "* ) at 430 mhz .",
    "these observations were very useful in determining the timing offsets between the mark - iii and the pspm data sets and in eliminating another offset that was found between the data acquired with the pspm before and after the arecibo upgrade .",
    "observations with the pspm were resumed after the upgrade in november 1997 . since then , the pulsar has been systematically timed at 430 mhz and 1400 mhz at 3 - 4 week intervals .",
    "a more detailed description of the data acquisition and the toa measurement process can be found in @xcite .    the timing model included the pulsar spin and astrometric parameters , keplerian elements of the orbits of planets a , b , and c , and the three variables @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath20 introduced to parametrize perturbations between planets b and c , as described above .",
    "a propagation delay and its long - term decline due to the varying line - of - sight electron density were parametrized in terms of the dispersion measure ( dm ) and its first three time derivatives .",
    "low - amplitude dm variations on the timescales of hundreds of days have been removed by means of direct measurements of local dm values averaged over consecutive 3 month intervals .",
    "the most recent version of the timing analysis package tempo ( see http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) , was modified to incorporate this model and to least - squares fit it to the observed topocentric toas .",
    "the final best - fit residuals for daily - averaged toas are characterized by a @xmath303.0 @xmath31s rms noise which is consistent with a predicted value of @xmath302.0 @xmath31s based on the observing parameters and the system performance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the residuals for three fits to data involving different sets of parameters are shown in fig . 1 and",
    "the model parameters for the final fit of the full timing model are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the new timing model for psr b1257 + 12 offers further improvement of the accuracy of the determination of the standard pulsar and planetary parameters and , most importantly , it includes highly significant values for the three perturbation - related parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath20 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . from @xmath32 ,",
    "one obtains the masses of planets b and c to be 4.3@xmath10.2@xmath2 and 3.9@xmath10.2@xmath2 , respectively , using the canonical pulsar mass , @xmath33 = 1.4 @xmath0 .",
    "since the scatter in the measured neutron star masses is small @xcite , it is unlikely that a possible error in the assumed pulsar mass would significantly affect these results .",
    "because of the @xmath34 ambiguity , there are four possible sets of the orbital inclinations for the planets b and c : @xmath35 , @xmath36 corresponding to the difference in the ascending nodes @xmath37 ( relative inclination @xmath38 ) , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , corresponding to the difference in the ascending nodes @xmath41 ( relative inclination @xmath42 ) . obviously , in both cases the planets have nearly coplanar orbits , but in the latter one , their orbital motions have opposite senses . because our numerical simulations of the system s dynamics show that this situation leads to distinctly different perturbative toa variations that are not observed , only the first two sets of the orbital inclinations , 53@xmath34@xmath4 and 47@xmath33@xmath4 or 127@xmath4 and 133@xmath4 are plausible .",
    "this implies that the two planets move in nearly coplanar orbits in the same sense .",
    "in addition , with the known value of @xmath20 ( table  2 ) , one obtains @xmath43 or @xmath44 from equation .",
    "since it is reasonable to assume that the inner planet a is in the same plane , its mass given in table 2 has been calculated for orbital inclination of 50@xmath4 .",
    "although the formal errors of the orbital inclinations allow their relative inclination , @xmath45 , to be as high as @xmath46 , such a departure from the model assumption of @xmath47 would have little effect on the best - fit masses of the planets @xcite .",
    "the results described in this paper demonstrate that , under special circumstances created by the existence of measurable gravitational perturbations between planets b and c in the psr  b1257 + 12 system , it is possible to determine their true masses and orbital inclinations .",
    "a near 3:2 mmr between the orbits of the two planets and the fact that they are nearly coplanar imply that the pulsar system has been created as the result of a disk evolution similar to that invoked to describe planet formation around normal stars @xcite .",
    "this represents a firm observational constraint which requires that any viable theory of the origin of the pulsar planets provides means to create a circumpulsar disk of matter that survives long enough and has a sufficient angular momentum to enable planet formation . continuing timing observations of psr b1257 + 12",
    "will eventually settle the problem of a fourth , more distant planet ( or planets ) around it @xcite and provide further constraints on the origin and evolution of this planetary system .",
    "another important consequence of the determination of true masses of planets b and c is the implied long - term stability of the pulsar system .",
    "this problem has been investigated by @xcite and @xcite , who have established that the two planets would have to be as massive as 2 - 3 jupiter masses to render the system dynamically unstable on a @xmath48 yr timescale .",
    "obviously , the measured , terrestrial masses of the planets ( table 2 ) are much too low to create such a condition .",
    "in fact , this conclusion is not surprising , given another result of @xcite , who have calculated that , if the masses of the two planets were about 20 - 40@xmath2 , the system would be locked in the exact 3:2 mmr and the character of perturbations would be very different from the observed near - resonance configuration .",
    "the early theories of pulsar planet formation have been summarized by @xcite and further discussed by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite and @xcite have examined the conditions of survival and evolution of pulsar protoplanetary disks .",
    "they have concluded that an initially sufficiently massive ( @xmath49 g ) disk would be able to resist evaporation by the pulsar accretion flux and create planets on a typical , @xmath50-year timescale . a quick formation of a massive disk around the pulsar could , for instance , be accomplished by tidal disruption of a stellar companion @xcite or , possibly , in the process of a white dwarf merger @xcite . both these processes ,",
    "although entirely feasible , can not be very common .",
    "in fact , with the exception of psr b1257 + 12 , no planetary companions have emerged from the precision timing of 48 galactic millisecond pulsars @xcite , implying their rarity , independently of the specific formation mechanism .",
    "since the current evidence points to isolated millisecond pulsars as best candidates for a presence of planetary companions around them @xcite , new detections of such objects by the ongoing and future pulsar surveys will be very important .",
    "so far , only 10 solitary millisecond pulsars , including psr b1257 + 12 , have been discovered .",
    "this remains in a stark contrast with the sample of about 2000 solar - type stars that are included in the doppler surveys for extrasolar planets @xcite .",
    "factors to be taken into account while designing pulsar planet searches must include the fact that such pulsars are less common and appear to be intrinsically even fainter than more typical , binary milisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "in addition , if the high space velocity of psr b1257 + 12 ( @xmath30300 km s@xmath51 , table 1 ) and the fact that it has planets were causally connected , such objects would spend most of the time near turnover points of their galactic orbits , which would make them difficult to detect . altogether",
    ", it appears that further improvement of the statistics of neutron star planetary systems may be a lengthy process , even if they are similar to those established for the occurence of giant planets around normal stars @xcite .",
