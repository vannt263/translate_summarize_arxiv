    "the search for a superfluid phase in molecular _ para_-hydrogen ( _ p_-h@xmath0 ) started from the theoretical proposal by ginzburg and sobyanin in 1972  @xcite .",
    "they suggested that _",
    "p_-h@xmath0 , with spin 1 , should be superfluid under a transition temperature @xmath1 that they estimated to be @xmath2 k using ideal bose gas theory .",
    "this relatively high temperature , compared with the well - known transition temperature in @xmath3he ( @xmath4 k ) , was the result of the smaller mass of _ p_-h@xmath0 .",
    "however , this estimation is too crude because the strong interactions between the _ p_-h@xmath0 molecules are simply ignored .",
    "moreover , the transition temperature for the ideal bose gas increases with the density @xmath5 as @xmath6 whereas it is known that in superfluid @xmath3he it slightly decreases with @xmath5 .",
    "later on , apenko  @xcite proposed a phenomenological theory similar to the lindemann criterion for classical crystal melting .",
    "he concluded that in _",
    "p_-h@xmath0 @xmath1 should vary between 1.1 and 1.2 k , depending on the density .",
    "a recent path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation of _ p_-h@xmath0 at low temperatures , in which it was possible to frustrate the formation of the stable crystal , showed that superfluidity appears at temperatures around 1 k  @xcite .",
    "superfluidity in bulk hydrogen is not observed because it crystallizes in an hcp phase at a temperature @xmath7 k which is much higher than the estimated transition temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the mean reason is that the intermolecular interaction is around three times more attractive than the one between he atoms .",
    "this enhanced attraction dominates over the positive effect produced by the smaller mass of h@xmath0 respect to the @xmath3he one .",
    "there have been a number of supercooling attempts to create a metastable liquid phase but even at @xmath8 k the liquid phase freezes quickly into a crystal  @xcite .",
    "one of the a priori more interesting options was to confine hydrogen in a porous media , like a vykor glass , with pores in the nanometer scale .",
    "however , the lowest temperature at which the system was detected to be liquid was @xmath9 k and so still far from the pursued superfluid  @xcite .    at present , the only experimental signatures of superfluid _ p_-h@xmath0 come from experiments with small doped clusters  @xcite . by measuring the rotational spectra of the embedded molecule it was possible to determine the effective moment of inertia of the cluster and thus the superfluid fraction .",
    "these experiments show significant evidence of superfluidity in clusters made up of @xmath10 molecules .",
    "larger clusters of up to @xmath11 molecules down to a temperature @xmath12 k have recently been produced but with no signature of superfluidity due to this still too high temperature  @xcite .",
    "another way of frustrating the formation of the crystal was the generation of continuous hydrogen filaments of macroscopic dimensions , but again without signature of superfluidity  @xcite .    on the theoretical side",
    ", the search for superfluidity in _ p_-h@xmath0 has been intense in the last decades .",
    "the well - known radial interaction between the molecules and the progress achieved in quantum monte carlo methods have allowed for accurate results in different geometries . to frustrate the crystal formation and reduce the strength of the interactions it was proposed to work with a two - dimensional geometry with some impurities arranged in a periodic lattice  @xcite .",
    "first results obtained within this scheme found finite superfluid densities but posterior simulations were not able to reproduce these signatures  @xcite .",
    "the greatest effort was devoted to the study of small clusters , both pure  @xcite and doped with impurities  @xcite .",
    "there is an overall consensus that _",
    "p_-h@xmath0 becomes superfluid at temperatures smaller than 1 - 2 k and that the superfluid fraction decreases fast with the number of molecules of the cluster . for @xmath13 - 25",
    "the superfluidity vanishes and solid - like structures are observed .",
    "recently , there has been interest in the study of _",
    "p_-h@xmath0 in quasi - one - dimensional environments  @xcite .",
    "again , the idea is to reduce dimensionality to soften the intermolecular attraction .",
    "quantum monte carlo calculations of hydrogen adsorbed inside narrow pores of different size and nature have been performed showing , in some cases , the existence of inner channels which behave as effectively one - dimensional systems .",
    "interestingly , a recent ground - state quantum monte carlo calculation  @xcite has shown that the inner channel of _",
    "p_-h@xmath0 adsorbed inside a ( 10,10 ) armchair carbon nanotube is superfluid .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the one - dimensional character of narrow channels of _ p_-h@xmath0 and determine the luttinger parameter  @xcite as a function of the linear density .",
    "our method is the path integral ground state ( pigs ) , a zero - temperature approach which is able to generate exact results for the ground - state of the system  @xcite .",
    "we have studied three different cases : a purely 1d array of molecules , _",
    "p_-h@xmath0 inside a ( 10,10 ) carbon nanotube coated with an incommensurate layer of hydrogen , and _ p_-h@xmath0 confined harmonically to move in a channel of different widths .",
    "our results show that moving from 1d to quasi-1d reduces effectively the interaction producing an increase of the luttinger parameter . however , this slight increment is not enough to achieve the superfluid - like behavior within luttinger theory",
    ". the system breaks its homogeneity when crossing the spinodal point and this happens clearly before of getting superfluity , in contradiction with the recent findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly discuss the method used in our analysis and describe the properties of the three different studied setups .",
    "our results are reported in sec .",
    "iii , mainly the dependence of the luttinger parameter with the density , within the stability regime of the quasi-1d system . finally , an account of the main conclusions is given in sec .",
    "the ground - state energy and structure properties of quasi - one - dimensional _",
    "p_-h@xmath0 have been studied using the path integral ground state ( pigs ) method  @xcite . for bosons and a given interaction ,",
    "this method is exact within controlled statistical noise .",
    "the ground - state wave function of the @xmath14-body system is obtained from @xmath15 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 the green s function in imaginary time @xmath18 , and @xmath19 a model wave function with the proper bose symmetry . obviously , the green s function for a generic time @xmath18 is not known in general but one can build @xmath20 from its knowledge at short times and then apply its convolution property to arrive to the desired total time @xmath18 .",
    "this is , in fact , the same method used at finite temperature ( the path integral monte carlo method ( pimc ) ) just changing the imaginary time to inverse of temperature and closing the paths instead of being open as in pigs .    in our simulations , we approximate the green s function at short time using the fourth - order splitting proposed by chin and chen  @xcite , that in previous calculations has shown high accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the trial wave function @xmath21 in eq .",
    "[ pigswf ] plays the role of boundary condition of the open paths .",
    "as we simulate a bose system it has to be symmetric under exchange of particles but its specific shape is rather irrelevant , its effect being mainly on the total imaginary time to project out the ground - state wave function  @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we have used a jastrow model with mcmillan correlation factors , @xmath22 , with @xmath23 .",
    "it is worth noticing that pigs provides pure ( unbiased ) estimators of diagonal and non - diagonal operators @xmath24 by calculating them in the center of a symmetric chain with @xmath25 at both extremes , that is , @xmath26 with @xmath27 a normalization constant .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath28 with @xmath29 the intermolecular interaction and @xmath30 the confining potential in the quasi-1d simulations . upon the condition of moderate pressures , it is justified to use a radial interaction between _ p_-h@xmath0 molecules because in the _ para _ state the h@xmath0 molecule is in the @xmath31 rotational state .",
    "we use the semi - empirical silvera - goldman potential  @xcite which has been extensively used in the past .",
    "when the system is not strictly 1d , we include an external potential @xmath30 which confines in the radial direction .",
    "in particular , for the quasi-1d calculations we have worked on two cases . in a first one , we study the inner channel inside a ( 10,10 ) carbon nanotube of radius @xmath32 coated with an incommensurate lattice of _ p_-h@xmath0 of density @xmath33 .",
    "this configuration is very close to the one obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the same nanotube . in our case",
    ", we obtain the potential @xmath30 as a sum of the interaction that an h@xmath0 molecule located at an @xmath34 distance to the center would feel due to the c atoms of the nanotube and the h@xmath0 molecules of the inert layer . at difference with other approaches which used the potential inside the nanotube by direct integration of the lennard - jones potential  @xcite ,",
    "we include here explicitly the real positions of the atoms and then summed up all to give the total interaction .",
    "the c - h@xmath0 potential is of lennard - jones type , with the same parameters than in ref .",
    "the second model to study the effects of departing from a strictly 1d geometry is a harmonic potential @xmath35 , with @xmath36 a parameter which controls the strength of the confinement .",
    "a similar harmonic model was used recently in a pimc simulation  @xcite .",
    "we used @xmath37 in the major part of our simulations ; partial runs with larger number of particles were also performed but the results were not significantly different , almost for the quantities of our interest .",
    "the time step was @xmath38 and convergence was achieved at imaginary times @xmath39 .",
    "the energy per particle as a function of the linear density @xmath5 is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : energy ] for the three studied systems : 1d , ( 10,10 ) carbon nanotube ( nt ) , and harmonic confinement ( hc ) .",
    "we adjusted the parameter @xmath36 in the hc case to be close to the particle density profile of the nt case . by taking @xmath40",
    "we obtain in fact very similar density profiles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] .",
    "coming back to the energy results , one can see that near the equilibrium point the equations of state are rather similar ( in the nt and hc cases we have subtracted to the energy per particle the energy of a single molecule in the same environment ) .",
    "the equilibrium densities @xmath41 for 1d , nt , and hc are @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , respectively ( numbers within parenthesis are the statistical errors ) .",
    "the possibility of movement in the radial direction makes that the quasi-1d configuration equilibrates at a slightly larger density with respect to the 1d limit . on the other hand ,",
    "the spinodal point @xmath45 , defined as the point where the speed of sound becomes zero , appears in quasi-1d at densities statistically indistinguishable of the 1d limit , @xmath46 .",
    "however , the most significant effect of opening the radial direction is produced at large densities in which the growth of the energy with the density is clearly steeper in 1d than in the nt and hc cases .     as a function of the density .",

    "this phenomenological theory predicts the large - distance ( small momenta ) of the distribution functions . within this model ,",
    "the results are universal in terms of the luttinger parameter @xmath50 . in a homogeneous system , like the one we are studying here",
    ", @xmath50 is determined by the fermi velocity @xmath51 and the speed of sound through the relation @xmath52 . in 1d ,",
    "the fermi momentum is @xmath53 .",
    "the estimation of @xmath50 for different densities requires of a full many - body calculation since the speed of sound depends strongly on the intermolecular interaction .",
    "according to luttinger theory  @xcite , the pair distribution function in one dimension behaves at large distances as @xmath54 that is a sum of oscillating terms modulated by a power - law decaying amplitude .",
    "the exponents of the attenuation are only dependent on the luttinger parameter @xmath50 , whereas the amplitudes @xmath55 of each term of the sum are not determined within the luttinger theory . the oscillations in @xmath56 ( [ pairdist ] )",
    "can produce divergences at momentum values @xmath57 .",
    "this can be observed in the static structure factor @xmath58 , with @xmath59 .",
    "in fact , the height of the @xmath60 peak in @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 which diverges with the number of particles @xmath14 for values @xmath63 .",
    "in particular , the first peak diverges when @xmath64 . in luttinger theory this regime",
    "is termed quasicrystal for the resemblance to bragg peaks in two and three dimensions .",
    "however , a _ true _",
    "crystal in 2d and 3d shows real bragg peaks in which the height of the peak increases linearly with @xmath14 whereas in 1d this only happens when asymptotically @xmath65 .     at different densities ( in @xmath66 ) . ]    in fig . [",

    "the resulting effective potential is more than three times less attractive than the silvera - goldman h@xmath0-h@xmath0 potential and thus their calculation leads to the possibility of getting the quasi - superfluid regime because the spinodal density of this effective model is much smaller .",
