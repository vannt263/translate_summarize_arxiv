    "in analyzing the observed results in neutrino events occurring inside the detector in the super - kamiokande experiment , the direction of the incident neutrino is assumed to be coincided with that of the produced lepton detected by the detector which is fundamental for their analysis . in order to avoid any misunderstanding toward their approximation on the direction of the incident neutrino",
    "we reproduce this approximation from the original papers and their related papers in italic .",

    "also , we treat the correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in stochastic manner .",
    "we show that the approximation of @xmath12 with @xmath13 by the super - kamiokande collaboration does not make so serious error compared with the case of @xmath2 by @xmath3 , although their treatment is theoretically unsuitable ( figure  5 ) .",

    ", we give the procedure for our numerical computer experiment . in our numerical computer experiment",

    "our numerical computer experiments are being carried out for two different live days ; namely , one is 1489.2 live days which is equal to the actual live days by super - kamiokande experiment@xcite and the other is 14892 days , ten times as much as the super - kamiokande experiment actual live days .",

    "it should be noticed that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are regulated by both the energy spectrum of the incident neutrino and the production spectrum of the muon and , consequently , their mutual relation is influenced by either the absence of the oscillation or the presence of the oscillation which depend on the combination of the oscillation parameters .    in figure  3",
    ", we give the correlation diagram between @xmath2 and @xmath3 among _ fully contained events _ for the 1489.2 live days in the absence of neutrino oscillation which corresponds to the actual super - kamiokande experiment@xcite .",
    "the aggregate of the ( anti- ) neutrino events which correspond to a definite combination of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are essentially classified into four groups in the following :    the group a is defined as the aggregate for neutrino events in which both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are rather smaller .",
    "it denotes that the downward neutrinos produce the downward muons . in this case , the energies of the produced muons are near the energies of the incident neutrinos due to smaller scattering angles .",
    "the group b is defined as the aggregate for neutrino events in which both @xmath2 and @xmath3 are rather larger .",
    "it denotes that the upward neutrinos produce upward muons . in this case , the energy relation between the incident neutrinos and the produced muons is essentially the same as in the group a , because the flux of the upward neutrino events is symmetrical to that of the downward neutrino events in the absence of the neutrino oscillation .",
    "the group c is defined as the aggregate for neutrino events in which @xmath2 are rather smaller and @xmath3 are rather larger .",
    "it denotes that the downward neutrinos produce the upward muons , namely by the possible effect reusulting from both backscattering and azimuthal angle in qel , which is considered in the preceding paper @xcite . in this case , the energies of the produced muon are rather smaller than those of the energies of the incident neutrinos due to larger scattering angles .",
    "the group d is defined as the aggregate for the neutrino events in which @xmath2 are rather larger and @xmath3 are rather smaller .",
    "it denotes that the upward the neutrinos produce the downward muons the energy relation between the incident neutrinos and the produced muon is essentially the same as in the group c in the absence of the neutrino oscillation .",
    "it is clear from the figure  3 that there exist the symmetries between group a and group b , and also between group c and group d , which reflect the symmetry between the upward neutrino flux and the downward neutrino one for null oscillation .    in figure  4 , we give the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 under their neutrino oscillation parameters , say , @xmath32 and @xmath33 @xcite . in the presence of the neutrino oscillation , the property of the symmetry which holds in the absence of the neutrino oscillation ( see [ group a and group b ] and/or [ group c and group d ] in figure  3 ) is lost due to the different incident neutrino fluxes in the upward direction and downward one .",
    "if we compare group a with group b , the event number in the group b ( upward @xmath34 @xmath35 upward @xmath36 ) is smaller than that in the group a ( downward @xmath34 @xmath35 downward @xmath36 ) , which comes from smaller flux of the upward neutrinos . the similar relation between the group c ( downward @xmath34 @xmath35 upward @xmath36 ) and the group d ( upward @xmath34 @xmath35 downward @xmath36 ) is held in figure  4 . summarizing the characteristics among the groups a to d in the figures  3 and 4 , we could conclude that [ group a and group b ] and [ group c and group d ] are in symmetrical situations in the absence of the neutrino oscillation , while such the symmetrical situation is lost in the presence of the neutrino oscillation .",
    "also , it is clear from the figures  3 and 4 that @xmath9 , _ the sk assumption on the direction _ does not hold both in the absence of the neutrino oscillation and in the presence of the neutrino oscillation even if statistically .    here , it should be noticed that the approximation of @xmath9 could not hold completely in the region c and region d. the event number in the group c and group d could not be neglected among the total event number concerned . in these regions ,",
    "neutrino events consist of those with backscattering and/or neutrino events in which the neutrino directions are horizontally downward ( upward ) but their produced muon turn to be upward ( downward ) resulting from the effect of azimuthal angles in qel , respectively .",
    "super - kamiokande collaboration estimate @xmath12 from @xmath13 , the visible energy of the muon , from their monte carlo simulation , by the following equation@xcite(p.135 ) :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 .",
    "the idea that @xmath12 could be approximated as the polynomial means that there is unique relation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "however , in the light of stochastic characters inherent in the incident neutrino energy spectrum and the production spectrum of the muon , such the treatment is not suitable theoretically , which may kill real correlation effect between the incident neutrino energy and the emitted muon energy . in figure  5 , we give the correlation between @xmath12 and @xmath13 together with that obtained from the polynomial expression by the super - kamiokande collaboration under the their neutrino oscillation parameters .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the part of the lower energy incident neutrino deviates largely from the approximated formula , which reflects explicitly the stochastic character of the qel",
    ". we could give the similar relation for null oscillation , the shape of which may be different from that with the oscillation due to the difference in the incident neutrino energy spectrum .",
    "in figures  6 and 7 , we give @xmath0 distribution without oscillation for 1489.2 live days ( sk live days@xcite ) and 14892 live days , respectively .",
    "both distributions show the sinusoidal - like character for @xmath0 distribution , namely , the appearance of the top and the dip , appear even for null oscillation .",

    ", we could observe the first maximum oscillation ( eq.7 - 1 , arrow a ) and the second(eq.7 - 2 , arrow b ) clearly , and the third ( eq.7 - 3 , arrow c ) faintly , which means not enough statistics for the confirming the existence of the third maximum oscillation . in figure  9 , we could observe similar situation for another 1489.2 live days as observed in figure  8 . in figure  10 , we give the @xmath43 distribution with the oscillation for 14892 live days being ten times as much as those of figures  8 and 9 . in figure  10 , we could observe a more narrower dip which corresponds to the first maximum oscillation due to ten times statistics as much as those of figures  8 and 9 .",
    "also , we could observe the second maximum oscillation clearly , too .",
    "however , it is a little bit difficult to observe the third maximum oscillation for even larger statistics .    in figure  11",
    ", we give the correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath12 which is obtained from the same data as in figure  8 .",
    "the linearly strip patterns in which there are absent from the combinations of @xmath2 and @xmath12 , correspond to the first , the second and third maximum in the @xmath43 distribution . in figure  12 , we give the same correlation for 14892 days being ten times larger than the super - kamiokande experiment actual live days . compared figure  12 with figure  11 , the larger statistics show more clear strip pattern which correspond to more clear existence of the maximum oscillation as in the figure  10 .",
    "lines a , b and c in figures  11 and 12 correspond to eqs.(7 - 1),(7 - 2 ) and ( 7 - 3 ) respectively . surely , we observe dips characterized by these lines where we have no events .",
    "namely , these figures show the presence of the maximum oscillation obtained from eq.(6 ) .",
    "+ from the point of view of the numerical computer experiment , the survival probability of a given flavor is give as the ratio of @xmath45 . in figures  13 and",
    "figure 14 , these ratios are given for 1489.2 live days and 14892 live days being ten times as much as 1489.2 live days , respectively .",
    "these ratios indicate the presence of the maximum oscillations shown as arrows a , b and c. comparing the ratio of 1489.2 live days with that of 14892 live days in the light of their smoothness , it seems that statistics with 1489.2 live days are not so beautiful compared to statistics with 14892 live days .",
    "now , it is concluded from figures 8 to 14 that our numerical computer experiments are carried out in a correct way , which shows really the sinusoidal flavor transition probability of neutrino oscillation under the neutrino oscillation parameters by the super - kamiokande collaboration , if they really exist .",
    "however , at the same time , it should be noticed that such neutrino oscillatory signature could not be observed really at all even if it really exists , because both the physical quantities , @xmath2 and @xmath12 , are not physical observables .",
    "in our numerical computer experiment , we have found the existence of the maximum oscillation , 515km / gev , 1540km / gev and 2575km / gev , under the neutrino oscillation parameter ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , successfully , as they should be .",
    "it denotes that our numerical computer experiment have been done in correct way .",
    "both @xmath2 and @xmath12 could not be measurable , because neutrinos are neutral .",
    "consequently , even if the neutrino oscillation exist really , we could not detect neutrino oscillation from @xmath0 analysis .",
