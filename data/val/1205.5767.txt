    "over the past years the dominant explanation for the large mass to light ratios inferred for galactic and meta - galactic systems , that these are embedded within massive dark matter halos , has begun to be challenged .",
    "direct detection of the dark matter particles , in spite of decades of extensive and dedicated searches , remains lacking .",
    "numerous alternative theories of gravity have appeared ( e.g. teves of @xcite , f(r ) theories e.g. @xcite ) mostly grounded on geometrical extensions to general relativity , and leading to laws of gravity which in the low acceleration regime , mimic the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) fitting formulas e.g. @xcite .",
    "similarly , @xcite have explored mond not as a modification to newton s second law , but as a modified gravitational force law in the newtonian regime , finding a good agreement with observed dynamics across galactic scales without requiring dark matter .",
    "recently @xcite have constructed an @xmath5 extension to general relativity which in the low velocity limit converges to the above approach .",
    "a generic feature of all such modified gravity schemes is the appearance of an acceleration scale , @xmath2 , above which classical gravity is recovered , and below which the dark matter mimicking regime appears .",
    "this results in a general prediction ; all systems where @xmath6 should appear as devoid of dark matter , and all systems where @xmath7 should appear as dark matter dominated .",
    "it is interesting that no @xmath6 system has ever been detected where dark matter needs to be invoked . on the other hand",
    ", the latter condition furnishes a testable prediction in relation to the orbits of wide binaries . for test particles in orbit around a @xmath1 star , in circular orbits of radius @xmath8",
    ", the acceleration is expected to drop below @xmath9 for @xmath107000 au@xmath11 .",
    "this provides a test for the dark matter / modified theories of gravity debate ; the relative velocities of components of binary stars with large physical separations should deviate from kepler s third law .",
    "seen as an equivalent newtonian force law , beyond @xmath127000 au the gravitational force should gradually switch from the classical form of @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and the orbital velocity , @xmath15 , should no longer decrease with separation , but settle at a constant value , dependent only on the total mass of the system through @xmath16 . under modified gravity theories , binary stars with separations beyond 7000 au should exhibit `` flat rotation curves '' and a `` tully - fisher relation '' , as galactic systems in the same acceleration regime do .",
    "we apply this test to the binaries of two recent catalogues containing relative velocities and separations .",
    "the two catalogues are entirely independent in their approaches . the first one , @xcite , comprises 280 systems from the _ hipparcos _ satellite , while the second , @xcite , identifies 1,250 ones from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the newtonian prediction for the relative velocities of the two components of binaries having circular orbits , when plotted against the binary physical separation , @xmath8 , is for a scaling of @xmath17 , essentially following kepler s third law , provided the range of masses involved were narrow . in a relative proper motion sample however , only two components of the relative velocity appear , as velocity along the line of sight to the binary leads to no proper motion .",
    "thus , orbital projection plays a part , with systems having orbital planes along the line of sight sometimes appearing as having no relative proper motions .",
    "a further effect comes from any degree of orbital ellipticity present ; it is hence clear that the trend for @xmath17 described above , will only provide an upper limit to the distribution of projected @xmath18 vs. @xmath8 expected in any real observed sample , even if only a narrow range of masses is included .",
    "one should expect a range of measured values of projected @xmath18 at a fixed observed projected @xmath8 , all extending below the newtonian limit , which for equal mass binaries in circular orbits gives @xmath19 .",
    "further , over time , the orbital parameters of binaries will evolve due to the effects of galactic tidal forces and dynamical encounters with other stars in the field , specially in the case of wide binaries .",
    "to first order , one would expect little evolution for binaries tighter than the tidal limit of 1.7pc , and the eventual dissolution of wider systems .",
    "a very detailed study of all these points has recently appeared , @xcite .",
    "these authors numerically follow populations of 50,000 @xmath1 binaries in the galactic environment , accounting for the evolution of the orbital parameters of each due to the cumulative effects of the galactic tidal field at the solar radius . also , the effects of close and long range encounters with other stars in the field are carefully included , to yield a present day distribution of separations and relative velocities for an extensive population of wide binaries , under newtonian gravity .",
    "it is found that when many wide binaries cross their jacobi radius , the two components remain fairly close by in both coordinate and velocity space .",
    "thus , in any real wide binary search a number of wide pairs with separations larger than their jacobi radii will appear . finally ,",
    "@xcite obtain the rms one - dimensional relative velocity difference , @xmath20 , projected along a line of sight , for the entire populations of binaries dynamically evolved over 10 gyr to today , as plotted against the projected separation on the sky for each pair .",
    "the expected keplerian fall of @xmath21 for separations below 1.7 pc is obtained , followed by a slight rise in @xmath20 as wide systems cross the jacobi radius threshold .",
    "@xmath20 then settles at rms values of @xmath22 .",
    "this represents the best currently available estimate of how relative velocities should scale with projected separations for binary stars ( both bound and in the process of dissolving in the galactic tides ) under newtonian gravity .",
    "we see that all we need is a large sample of relative proper motion and binary separation measurements to test the newtonian prediction for the rms values of the 1 dimensional relative velocities of @xcite , and to contrast the @xmath23 and the @xmath24 predictions for the upper envelope of the @xmath18 vs. @xmath8 distributions .",
    "in the @xcite catalogue wide binaries are identified by assigning a probability above chance alignment to the systems by carefully comparing to the underlying background ( and its variations ) in a 5 dimensional parameter space of proper motions and spatial positions .",
    "we keep only binaries with a probability of non - chance alignment greater than @xmath25 .",
    "the binary search criteria used by the authors requires that the proposed binary should have no near neighbours ; the projected separation between the two components is thus always many times smaller than the typical interstellar separation .",
    "we use the reported distances to the primaries , where errors are smallest , to calculate projected @xmath18 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath26 and @xmath27 values reported .",
    "although the use of _ hipparcos _ measurements guarantees the best available quality in the data , we have also removed all binaries for which the final signal to noise ratio in the relative velocities was lower than @xmath28 .",
    "we are left with a sample of 280 binaries , having distances to the sun within @xmath29 in pc .",
    "the data show a perfectly flat upper envelope in a @xmath18 vs. projected @xmath8 , @xcite .",
    "the average signal to noise ratio for the data is 1.7 , with an average error on @xmath18 of 0.83 @xmath30 , which considering a @xmath31 factor from the top of the distribution to the real underlying upper limit for the sample , results in 3 @xmath30 as our estimate of the actual physical upper limit in @xmath18 .",
    "the sloan low mass wide pairs catalogue ( slowpokes ) of @xcite contains a little over 1,200 wide binaries with relative proper motions for each pair , distances and angular separations .",
    "also , extreme care was taken to include only physical binaries , with a full galactic population model used to exclude chance alignment stars using galactic coordinates and galactic velocities , resulting in an estimate of fewer than 2% of false positives .",
    "this yields only isolated binaries with no neighbours within many times the internal binary separation .",
    "again , we use the reported distances to the primaries to calculate projected @xmath18 and projected @xmath8 from the measured @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath32 values reported by @xcite , to obtain a sample of 417 binaries .",
    "the upper envelope of the distribution of @xmath18 from this catalogue does not comply with kepler s third law . as was the case with the _ hipparcos _ sample ,",
    "the upper envelope describes a flat line , as expected under modified gravity schemes .",
    "the average signal to noise in @xmath18 for the @xcite catalogue is 0.48 , with an average error on @xmath18 of 12 @xmath30 , which considering a @xmath31 factor from the top of the complete distribution to the real underlying upper limit gives the same @xmath33 as obtained for the @xcite _ hipparcos _ catalogue .",
    "figure ( 1 ) shows the rms value of the one - dimensional relative velocity difference for both of the samples discussed .",
    "the error bars give the error propagation on @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "we construct @xmath20 by considering only one coordinate of the two available from the relative motion on the plane of the sky .",
    "thus , each binary can furnish two @xmath20 measurements , which statistically should not introduce any bias .",
    "indeed , using only @xmath34 or only @xmath35 or both for each binary , yields the same mean values for the points shown .",
    "the small solid error bars result from considering an enlarged sample where each binary contributes two @xmath36 measurements , while the larger dotted ones come from considering each binary only once , and do not change if we consider only @xmath34 or only @xmath35 .",
    "the series of small @xmath37 interval data are for the _ hipparcos _ catalogue of @xcite , while the two broader crosses show results for the @xcite sdss sample .",
    "the solid curve is the newtonian prediction of the full galactic evolutionary model of @xcite for binaries , both bound and in the process of dissolving .",
    "note that the results of this simulation deviate from kepler s law for @xmath8 larger than the newtonian jacobi radius of @xmath38 , whereas the discrepancy with the observed samples also occurs at much smaller separations . even considering the large error bars , where each binary contributes only one @xmath20 value",
    ", we see eight points lying beyond 1@xmath39 , making the probability of consistency between this prediction and the observations of less than @xmath40=@xmath41 .",
    "we obtain a constant rms value for @xmath20 of 1 @xmath30 , in qualitative agreement with expectations from modified gravity schemes .",
    "the vertical line marks @xmath42 ; we see the data departing from the newtonian prediction outwards of this line , and not before .",
    "the two independent catalogues , each using different sets of selection criteria , each perhaps subject to its own independent systematics , are consistent with the same result , a constant horizontal upper envelope for the distribution of relative velocities on the plane of the sky at an intrinsic value of 3 @xmath431 @xmath30 , extending over 3 orders of magnitude in @xmath8 , with a constant rms @xmath20 value consistent with 1 @xmath430.5 @xmath30 .",
    "this supports the interpretation of the effect detected as the generic prediction of modified gravity theories .",
    "the solid curve gives the rms values for one dimensional projected relative velocities as a function of projected separations , for the dynamical modelling of large populations of wide binaries evolving in the galactic environment , taken from @xcite .",
    "the same quantity for the data from the catalogues analysed is given by the points with error bars ; those with narrow @xmath37 intervals being from the _ hipparcos _ sample of @xcite , and those two with wide @xmath37 intervals coming from the sdss sample of @xcite ]",
    "we identify a critical test in the classical gravity / modified gravity debate , using the relative velocities of wide binaries with separations in excess of 7000 au , as these occupy the @xmath0 regime .",
    "we present a first application of this test using the best currently available data .",
    "results show constant relative rms velocities for the binary stars in question .",
    "this is quantitatively inconsistent with detailed predictions of newtonian dynamical models for binaries evolving in the local galactic environment .",
    "our results are qualitatively in accordance with generic modified gravity models which explain galactic dynamics in the absence of dark matter .",
