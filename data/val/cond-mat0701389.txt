    "the kondo lattice model ( klm ) is one of the prototype models in solid state physics whenever the coupling of itinerant charge carrier spins with immobile localized magnetic moments has to be considered .",
    "there are various quite different classes of materials for which the klm is used to describe the electronic and magnetic properties at least in principle .    in its simplest single - band version",
    "the klm hamiltonian reads @xmath0 the first term describes non - interacting electrons ( @xmath1 annihilates ( creates ) an electron of spin @xmath2 at lattice site @xmath3 ) with hopping integrals @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is the electron spin and @xmath6 the localized spin operator , and both are exchange coupled by @xmath7 .",
    "depending on the sign of @xmath7 one is confronted with quite different physics .",
    "numerous studies have been carried to understand the physics of heavy fermion systems .",
    "here the coupling between electrons and localized spins favors an antiparallel configuration ( @xmath8 ) leading to a competition between rkky interaction and spin screening effects .    in this work",
    "we want to focus on a favored parallel spin alignment ( @xmath9 , ferromagnetic kondo lattice model , fklm ) .",
    "the fklm was introduced to model the magnetism in some manganese compounds ( `` manganites '' ) . in the framework of a simple two - site model this kind of interaction",
    "was found to result from the so - called double exchange lending its name to the lattice version in the strong coupling regime.@xcite    in the manganites the 5 mn d - shells are split by the crystal field into three degenerate @xmath10-orbitals forming localized spins of @xmath11 which interact via hund s rule with itinerant electrons stemming from the remaining two degenerate @xmath12-orbitals . due to the jahn - teller effect and the strong coulomb interaction among the conduction electrons",
    "the manganites exhibit a complex phase diagram , the most prominent phenomenon of which is colossal magnetoresistance.@xcite although for a more quantitative description of manganite materials additional ingredients like orbital physics , electron - polaron interaction , and a strong hubbard - like coulomb interaction are needed , numerous research work on the subject has been carried out using the simple one - orbital model ( [ hklm]).@xcite    more recently attention was directed to the diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) that are thought to have the potential for promising technical applications in microelectronics.@xcite substituting transition metal impurities like mn in a semiconducting host ( often iii / v like gaas ) localized magnetic moments are introduced with the consequence of ferromagnetic ordering of the randomly distributed maganese cation spins that interact via their ( ferromagnetic , intermediate ) coupling to valence and impurity band holes .",
    "another important field of application of the fklm is the theoretical description of rare earth substances like eu and gd and their compounds . here",
    "it initially served to explain the famous red - shift of the absorption edge of the optical @xmath13 transition in the ferromagnetic semiconductor euo.@xcite combined lda / many - body calculations based on the fklm yielded realistic values of the curie temperature for gd@xcite and predicted surface states in euo - films@xcite .",
    "doping gd into euo makes for an attractive means to tune the charge carrier density and thus the carrier - induced coupling among the magnetic ions.@xcite having the same benefit , gd - doped gan was reported to yield high @xmath14 ferromagnetism above 300 k.@xcite    in all of the above - mentioned substances , especially regarding possible technical applications in the future , it is important to understand and make use of the special physical properties due to reduced dimensionality .",
    "several recent works focussed on the role of magnetic anisotropy effects in thin films of manganites@xcite or of dms films like ( ga , mn)as@xcite . gd films are investigated due to their potential employment in spintronics as well as motivated by the `` evergreen '' issue of a possibly enhanced surface curie temperature.@xcite it is furthermore a well - known fact that the curie temperature strongly depends on the film thickness . due to the broad relevance of the fklm in current research on magnetism and electronic correlations and due to the importance of film structures",
    "it is worthwhile investigating the dependence of the ferromagnetic transition temperature on the model parameters .    from the theoretical point of view our treatment of fklm films that is divided up into two parts .",
    "first we solve the problem for the electronic self - energy within an equation of motion approach that is based on a decoupling scheme fulfilling non - trivial limiting cases . in the second step we map the interaction onto an effective localized spin hamiltonian by integrating out the electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this results in effective exchange integrals which incorporate the interaction of the localized moments via the conduction electrons beyond conventional rkky theory .",
    "they depend on temperature and carrier density . in sum",
    "we end up with a self - consistent theory which does not require the assumption of classical core spins and which is employable at all temperatures .",
    "results on the magnetization and critical temperature of ferromagnetic klm model films with finite band occupation have already been reported in ref . .",
    "however , in the present work we make use of a more sophisticated approach for the fermionic subsystem and carry out a wider and considerably more detailed investigation of the curie temperature .",
    "a similar system is also treated in ref .",
    "based on a method guided by the same spirit .",
    "however , the theory of the electronic subsystem there is on a mean - field level only and just nearest neighbor heisenberg interaction is considered , in spite of the underlying rkky - like exchange being long ranged .",
    "what s more the effective exchange integrals derived in ref . in terms of the susceptibility of free electrons",
    "are proportional to @xmath15 and thus fail to give the appropriate strong - coupling behavior where the curie temperature is independent of @xmath7 .",
    "as far as the numerical evaluation is concerned the thickness dependence of the curie temperature is analysed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize our method to solve the klm for the electronic self - energy .",
    "then we derive an effective heisenberg hamiltonian which results from integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom . in the numerical results section",
    "we discuss the temperature dependent quasiparticle excitation spectrum and charge transfer before we present an extensive analysis of the curie temperature and its dependence on the various model paramters like , e.g. , the magnetic anisotropy strength .",
    "in second - quantized notation and introducing greek indices to number the layers the hamiltonian ( [ hklm ] ) becomes @xmath16 @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the cartesian components of the localized spin operator @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 is the particle density operator .    in the following",

    "a local approximation of the self - energy @xmath27 is performed .",
    "this corresponds to neglecting magnon energies in the three - dimensional case@xcite and is justified by the fact that these energies are usually orders of magnitude smaller than the exchange coupling @xmath7 and the electron bandwidth @xmath28 .    from ( [ g ] ) one immediately obtains the one - particle local density of states ( ldos ) : @xmath29    it should be mentioned that in general the mcda approach does not capture kondo scaling and especially violates the luttinger theorem @xmath30.@xcite although this might well be due to our approximative scheme questions if and in which parameter regimes the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model is a fermi liquid still remain open",
    ". nevertheless we would consider it worthwhile to investigate the low temperature kondo physics within the framework of our theory . in the present work , however , we rather want to focus on the magnetic transition temperature .    the self - energy matrix @xmath31 depends on various expectation values of pure fermionic , mixed fermionic - spin , and pure localized spin character : @xmath32    the first two types can be calculated self - consistently within the mcda using the corresponding green functions and the spectral theorem@xcite .",
    "the localized spin correlation functions like , to lowest order , the layer - dependent magnetization @xmath33 need further consideration . in order to evaluate these we map the interaction term ( [ hsf ] ) onto an effective coupling between the localized spins , which is carried out in the next section .",
    "it is well known that using perturbation theory ( [ hsf ] ) leads to the so - called rkky interaction.@xcite this second order interaction between localized spins is long ranged and yields an oscillatory behavior of the exchange coupling which is mediated by uncorrelated electrons .",
    "it appears highly desirable to have such a mapping without being restricted to the weak coupling regime .",
    "this requires finding an effective hamiltonian @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the number of lattice sites in one layer and the superscript @xmath36 formally indicates that the averaging is performed in the fermionic subspace only .",
    "the method we present in this section has been applied before to bulk kondo lattice systems.@xcite we generalize it into a matrix formulation which allows us to consider film structures , but is also relevant whenever sublattice decompositions are necessary , for instance when dealing with antiferromagnetic configurations .    in order to obtain the expectation value in ( [ hklm_av ] ) we introduce the modified green function @xmath37 the eom for @xmath38 reads @xmath39 in principle , this equation can be solved iteratively . applying",
    "the spectral theorem then yields the expectation value in ( [ hklm_av ] ) .",

    "we have to find a manageable approximation for @xmath38 on the right hand side of ( [ eom ] ) .",
    "it can easily be shown that in the non - interacting limit , @xmath40 conventional rkky interaction is reproduced . in order to include spin scattering",
    "effectively we dress the free propagator in ( [ crkky ] ) and replace it by the full propagator @xmath41 . within this modified rkky approximation ( mrkky )",
    "the exchange integrals in the effective hamiltonian @xmath42 are given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fermi function and the sum is over the first brillouin zone .",
    "within the tyablikov approximation@xcite the imaginary part of the transversal layer - diagonal spin green function ( spectral density ) can be written as @xmath45 where the spectral weights @xmath46 and energy poles @xmath47 have to be evaluated numerically . for a monolayer",
    "we can drop all greek indices , @xmath48 , and we get the well - known spin wave energies @xmath49    applying the callen method@xcite to superlattices the layer - dependent magnetization , @xmath50 and other higher order spin correlation functions can be obtained using the bose - like distribution function @xmath51 ( [ g]),([jeff ] ) , and ( [ sz ] ) represent a self - consistent system of equations that can be solved for the one - particle green function matrix @xmath52 and the magnetization @xmath53 .    before proceeding to the numerical evaluation we have to reconsider our effective hamiltonian ( [ hjeff ] ) .",
    "it is known that for low - dimensional systems anisotropies can become very important and even a necessary condition for magnetic ordering at finite temperature.@xcite we therefore include a single - ion anisotropy term @xmath54 the physical background of this magnetic anisotropy is spin - orbit coupling , which usually is some order of magnitudes smaller than the exchange coupling between localized spins .",
    "a positive @xmath55 favors an out - of - plane easy axis , i.e. perpendicular to the film plane .",

    "note that this decoupling is valid only if the magnetization is parallel to the @xmath60-direction . in order to ensure this a rotation of the coordinate system might be required before the decoupling , for instance when an arbitrary oriented magnetic field is present.@xcite    for bulk or a monolayer ( @xmath61 ) it is possible to derive a simple formula for the curie temperature @xmath14 . expanding ( [ sz ] ) and ( [ phi ] ) in the vicinity of @xmath14",
    "one easily finds @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a constant and depends on the specific decoupling of the anisotropy green function ( [ gf_aniso]).@xcite    for @xmath64 the spin wave energies are no longer known in analytical form as in ( [ e_k ] ) .",
    "one can then , however , use ( [ sz ] ) to determine the critical temperature .",
    "all numerical results have been obtained for simple cubic ( sc ) ( 100 ) films .",
    "the nearest - neighbor hopping integral @xmath65 in the tight binding approximation was chosen according to a bulk bandwidth @xmath66 , i.e. @xmath67 . the value of the exchange coupling is assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic for all sites and layers of the films , as already implied by ( [ hsf ] ) .",
    "furthermore for the anisotropy constant we set @xmath68 for all layers .",

    "[ qdos_tscan ] shows the ldos at different temperatures between @xmath73 and @xmath14 .",

    "the general picture for a layered system is the same as for the bulk kondo lattice model.@xcite at low temperature the spin - up spectrum basically consists of the rigidly shifted non - interacting electron energy band . at @xmath73 and in the insulating limit",
    "( band occupation @xmath74 ) this is a rigorous result.@xcite for the spin - down ldos the situation is different . besides a band at higher energies corresponding to an antiparallel coupling of conduction electrons and localized spins",
    "there is a scattering part in the energy range of the @xmath75-band reflecting the fact that a @xmath76-electron can flip its spin by creating a magnon in the localized spin subsystem . with increasing temperature spin symmetry in the spectrum",
    "is gradually established .",
    "this is accompanied by a reduction of the bandwidth due to reduced effective hopping by spin scattering . for intermediate coupling strengths @xmath77 as in fig .",
    "[ qdos_tscan ] this leads to a temperature - induced opening of a gap in the excitation spectrum .",
    "from the zero bandwidth limit one can learn that the distance between the two correlated bands roughly scales as @xmath78 .",
    "apart from these facts already known from bulk results one also observes typical features of reduced dimensionality .",
    "the number of van - hove singularities which are most pronounced at low temperatures is indicative of the number of layers and therefore for the finiteness of the film system .",
    "a second important observation is the reduced _ effective _ bandwidth of the surface compared to the center layer ldos .",
    "this can be directly traced back to the lower variance of the surface ldos : in the non - interacting limit @xmath79 and @xmath80 for a sc(100 ) geometry .",
    "the effect is thus not correlation induced and more pronounced for `` open '' film geometries .",
    "the band edges of the surface and center ldos , however , are the same .",
    "the broken translational symmetry is furthermore responsible for the occurence of charge transfer , i.e. the deviation @xmath81 of the layer dependent band filling from the average occupation number : @xmath82 @xmath83 is the number of layers .",
    "charge transfer is already present in the free electron film system and is due to the smaller effective bandwidth of the surface layer ( occupation @xmath84 ) . from this",
    "follows directly that in order to ensure thermodynamic equilibrium , i.e. a common chemical potential @xmath85 , one has @xmath86 below and @xmath87 above half - filling ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "switching on the coupling of the electron spins to the localized spins the question arises how this behavior changes .",
    "[ charge_transfer_n ] shows the difference of the surface and the average occupation number as a function of @xmath72 at @xmath73 and ferromagnetic saturation .",
    "whereas the electron density in the surface layer @xmath89 is always below the average density @xmath72 in the non - interacting limit ( @xmath90 ) one also finds @xmath91 at @xmath92 for @xmath9 .",
    "the explanation follows the same reasoning as above for the free system : a reduced or enhanced occupation in the surface layer is linked to the chemical potential being in the lower or upper half of the ldos , respectively . as there is a ( mainly @xmath76- ) transfer of spectral weight to higher energies for finite @xmath7 the chemical potential crosses the maximum of the lower band at values @xmath92 .",
    "one finds the qualitatively same and quantitatively similar behavior in the spin disordered phase where @xmath93 .",
    "a second point is the dependence of the charge transfer on the coupling strength @xmath7 .",
    "the interaction term ( [ hsf ] ) alone energetically favors single occupation of a lattice site for @xmath92 .",
    "this can be easily seen in the zero bandwidth limit.@xcite it can thus be expected that a finite @xmath7 suppresses charge transfer .",
    "this is indeed the case as fig .",
    "[ charge_transfer_j ] shows where the electron density for the different layers of a 5-layer film is plotted as a function of the exchange coupling .",
    "the change of sign of @xmath81 is again caused by the same mechanism as pointed out above .",
    "given a band occupation of @xmath92 the chemical potential moves from the lower half of the bloch bands ( @xmath90 ) to the upper half of the lower quasiparticle subband ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we observe that even @xmath94 does not lead to complete charge neutrality and that at large @xmath7 the higher occupation of the surface layer goes with an almost homogeneous charge distribution in the inner layers of the film .",
    "it is also interesting to note that at @xmath95 there is a quasi - homogenous charge distribution which coincides with the change of sign of @xmath81 .",
    "one can summarize that the effect of charge transfer is highest at low couplings @xmath7 and low average band occupations @xmath72 , where it can amount to almost 30% ( fig .",
    "[ charge_transfer_n ] at @xmath96 ) .",
    "it appears to be of minor importance in the strong coupling regime , especially at higher charge carrier densities .",
    "all the findings we have discussed in this section are qualitatively the same for other film thicknesses . as already mentioned charge transfer effects are more pronounced in `` open '' surface geometries with a stronger relative reduction in the number of nearest neighbors of a surface atom .",
    "however , the _ order of magnitude _ of the effect is the same .",
    "of course in real systems , coulomb interaction prevents charge separation on a macroscopic scale . for the present purpose",
    "it is sufficient to discuss how charge transfer affects the ferromagnetic transition temperature of kondo lattice films . to this end",
    "we will compare results based on calculations with and without charge transfer .",

    "taking into consideration the energy scales of the klm one would expect this tendency .",
    "quite generally the physics should be governed by the ratio @xmath116 .",

    "curie temperatures were discussed for a variety of parameters like the exchange coupling @xmath7 , the band occupation @xmath72 , and for various number of layers . for large enough band occupation",
    "we obtain a critical @xmath103 below which ferromagnetism is not stable . in the strong coupling regime @xmath14 saturates and increases with the number of layers .",
    "we have not found any significant influence of charge transfer on the curie temperature of klm films .",
    "in addition to the mrkky self - consistent @xmath100-results energy calculations of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic state were used to discuss both the critical interaction strength in the intermediate coupling regime and the crucial role the kinetic energy plays in the strong coupling regime .",
    "depending on the values of the exchange coupling and the band occupation the dependence of the curie temperature on the film thickness exhibits quite a different behavior .",
    "we also discussed the effects of a single - ion anisotropy on the ferromagnetic transition temperature .",
    "whereas it can significantly elevate @xmath14 in the strong coupling regime it hardly affects the critical interaction strength @xmath103 .    in this work we took the rather classical spin quantum number @xmath109=7/2",
    "this would apply for rare earth systems as , e.g. , gd .",
    "systems of current interest as dms ( @xmath109=5/2 ) possess a somewhat high @xmath109 , and even for the manganites with @xmath109=3/2 classical spins are believed to be a reasonable approximation at least at low temperatures.@xcite nevertheless a more profound investigation of the dependence of the magnetic properties on the spin quantum number at higher temperatures appears to be highly valuable .",
    "a worthwhile extension of the present work would also be to use other lattice structures and to take additional magnetic configurations like antiferromagnetism into account .",
    "a combined bandstructure many - body calculation for gd could contribute to the much debated issues of an enhanced surface curie temperature and electronic surface states in this substance .",
    "more on the model level , making the exchange and anisotropy parameters layer dependent or analysing the influence of non - magnetic cap layers on the magnetic stability of klm films would be interesting tasks .",
    "furthermore an application to the problem of interlayer exchange coupling appears to be rewarding because the temperature dependent effective exchange integrals give direct access to the coupling between the layers in a film system .",
    "this investigation is planned for future work .      c.  zener , phys .",
