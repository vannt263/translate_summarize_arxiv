    "while the inhibition of classical mixing in quantum chaotic dynamics is a generally accepted consequence of the linearity of the schrodinger equation , how this inhibition is manifested in the dynamics of physical systems is not fully understood .",
    "this is a difficult question to address from a theoretical point of view because the complex nature of chaotic systems all but precludes an analytical approach , making general physical insights difficult to come by .",
    "however , by studying the semiclassical limit for simple low - dimensional systems , one can relate the quantum dynamics for specific case studies to generic features of the classical chaos and thereby discern generic semiclassical mechanisms that lead to the quantum inhibition of mixing .",
    "the mechanism responsible for classical mixing is the repeated folding and stretching of the classical lagrangian manifold in the vicinity of hyperbolic fixed points @xcite , and when the motion is chaotic , these folded structures , or `` tendrils , '' eventually fill almost all the available phase space .",
    "the folding and stretching process leads to an abundance of caustics , or turning points , in the lagrangian manifold . since quantum effects are , loosely speaking , amplified at caustics , this can have a dramatic effect on the semiclassical description of the motion .",
    "one example of this is seen in the scattering of a wave packet off of a barrier@xcite .",
    "when the wave packet reaches the turning point , it acquires a temporary standing wave modulation arising from the interference between the piece of the packet that has already reflected off the caustic and the piece that has not yet reached it .",
    "thus , the caustic temporarily amplifies the underlying quantum nature of an apparently classical object .",
    "schulman quantified this propensity for nonclassical effects at a caustic by showing that the contribution to the propagator per degree of freedom should go as @xmath1 rather than @xmath2 @xcite within a `` critical region''@xcite of the caustic where the actions of the direct and reflected paths differ by less than @xmath0 .    despite the dynamical sense conveyed by the term `` mixing , '' most studies of the inhibition of mixing in quantum chaos",
    "have explored either the statistics of energy levels or the spatial localization of eigenstates for ( bounded ) conservative systems .",
    "localization , or `` scarring , '' of chaotic eigenstates was first observed by heller for the stadium billiard @xcite , a strongly chaotic system with isolated unstable periodic orbits .",
    "heller s scars are local enhancements above the background intensity that occur along those orbits that are the least unstable  meaning that the ratio of the frequency of the orbit to the lyapunov exponent that characterizes the divergence of adjacent trajectories is significantly greater than one .",
    "a second mechanism for eigenstate localization has been observed by bohigas _",
    "et al._@xcite in the soft chaos of two weakly coupled quartic oscillators .",
    "the local enhancements found in the eigenstates for this system arise from the quantization of the remnants of kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) tori , or `` cantori . ''",
    "in contrast , we focus on the time domain rather than the energy domain , using semiclassical ideas to relate the quantum dynamics to the evolution of the classical lagrangian manifold for a chaotic hamiltonian system . in a recent publication@xcite we discussed the role of classical phase space structures in the quantum evolution of a wave packet prior to the onset of chaos . in particular , we considered the motion of a quantum particle in a cosine potential perturbed by an external force varying sinusoidally in time .",
    "we posed the problem in the naive semiclassical limit where the natural length , mass and time scales make @xmath0 small .",
    "we studied the dynamics of a wave packet that was initially well localized in position and momentum and compared it to that of the classical distribution in phase space . provided the classical distribution remains inside the separatrix of the unperturbed motion and avoids the hyperbolic fixed points on the separatrix , the two initially identical distributions were found to remain indistinguishable , even though both spread out to fill much of the initial well",
    "however , when the lagrangian manifold interacts with a hyperbolic fixed point and acquires a tendril - like feature , the wave function was found to exhibit a persistent nodal structure that represents the first appreciable quantum effect with no classical analog .",
    "we also showed that this feature is relatively benign , having little impact on the physical observables .",
    "in this paper we consider essentially the same system but focus our attention on the classical exit event when a substantial fraction of the classical distribution crosses the separatrix and leaves the well , marking the onset of chaos . here",
    "we will show that the apparent equivalence of the quantum and classical distributions rapidly disintegrates as the caustic in the lagrangian manifold moves past a hyperbolic fixed point , _ i.e. _ , as the turning point moves outside the initial well .",
    "specifically , we observe that while the peak in the classical probability density associated with the caustic follows the caustic out of the well , the peak in the quantum distribution becomes pinned at the top of the barrier .",
    "this pinning effect represents a specific dynamical mechanism for the quantum inhibition of classical mixing in a time - dependent hamiltonian system .",
    "we have deliberately chosen to study a time - dependent hamiltonian with one degree of freedom because it is sufficiently complex to exhibit chaos yet simple enough to be studied directly in phase space .",
    "we point out that this problem is not equivalent to the conservative two - dimensional problem obtained by elevating time to the role of an additional degree of freedom because of the distinct role of time as a parameter rather than an operator in quantum mechanics .",
    "the quasi - conservative system that one obtains by invoking the strobed - time floquet formalism@xcite is not relevant to our problem either since the phenomena we observe occur on a time scale that is a fraction of the period of the driving and can not be discussed meaningfully in terms of the quasi - energy floquet states .",
    "not being constrained by the symmetry of a time - invariant hamiltonian , the mechanisms we observe are not limited to conservative systems and may , in fact , be disallowed by that symmetry in certain cases .    although the origin of the pinning effect , like the nodes of our previous paper , can be understood semiclassically , the origins of the two effects are distinctly different . the nodes in ref .",
    "were shown to be the result of a beating phenomenon in the van vleck - gutzwiller ( vvg ) propagator@xcite between paths having the same gutzwiller phase .",
    "the most prominent nodes were found to be the closest in action to a false caustic in the flow field which developed as result of the interaction of the lagrangian manifold with the hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "in contrast , the structure we observe here is a result of interference between direct and reflected paths  which differ by @xmath3 in gutzwiller phase  and the most prominent structure is in the neighborhood of a true caustic .    because the stationary paths in the path integral converge at a caustic , the stationary phase approximation that leads to the vvg propagator by summing each classical path independently breaks down .",
    "therefore , to discuss the behavior near the caustic , we adopt a semiclassical propagator derived by schulman@xcite that is strictly valid only in the immediate vicinity of a caustic .",
    "since this propagator can not be evaluated numerically as easily as the vvg propagator , we develop an approximate `` connection formula'' similar in spirit to the wkb connection formulae  to evaluate the schulman propagator from the vvg expression .",
    "this yields an expression that is valid even at the caustic .",
    "we use this hybrid propagator to show that the differences between the classical and quantum behavior associated with the classical exit event can be understood semiclassically in terms of the area - preserving deformation of the manifold .",
    "furthermore , our propagator can be used to study the exponential tail of the wave function in the shadow or classically forbidden region of the caustic which is missed completely by the vvg propagator .",
    "this is important to our problem since the stretching of the exponential tail is the primary semiclassical mechanism for the quantum system to explore the world outside the remnant separatrix .",
    "hence , the vvg propagator , which puts zero amplitude in the classically forbidden region , becomes inadequate to describe the dynamics of the wave packet after the exit event .",
    "we point out that this failure of the vvg propagator is not necessarily inconsistent with the long - time accuracy achieved by heller and tomsovic @xcite in the case of the stadium billiard .",
    "since the amplitude in the forbidden regions is evidently negligible in that problem @xcite , it follows that the stretching of the exponential tail and associated phenomena that we observe must not be significant there .",

    "the schulman expression , on the other hand , not only gets the oscillations about right , but also correctly describes the exponential behavior at the caustic and into the shadow region where @xmath76 . in the cellular dynamics calculation",
    "the spurious singularity in the integrand causes the primary peak to have too much amplitude and to be shifted to the right , and the change in the location of the caustic across the set of time - evolved vertical strips that contribute to the integral gives rise to a tail in the shadow region that poorly approximates the true feature .",
    "while the integration smears the singularity out , it clearly does not fix the problem .",
    "in order to discuss the quantum dynamics of this system in a semiclassical context , it is necessary that we first point out several features of the classical flow as it approaches and interacts with the hyperbolic fixed points . in figures [ fig_dots](a)-(h )",

    "[ fig_dots](e ) .",
    "they , in fact , approach the hyperbolic fixed point at @xmath30 with a fraction of the original energy dispersion .",
    "this behavior is distinctly different from the spreading that occurs in the absence of the time - dependent perturbation and is not just a consequence of the orbital period being time - dependent .",
    "secondly , the bright side of the caustic ( @xmath80 ) is not restricted to the inside of the initial well ( @xmath81 ) , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_dots](g ) and [ fig_dots](h ) .",
    "the phase space coordinates of the caustic are clearly outside the separatrix in both cases .",
    "the remnant separatrix is thus only a `` partial barrier to transport '' @xcite that temporarily confines the phase space flow , and the interaction of the flow with the hyperbolic fixed point is the door to the region of phase space that was inaccessible in the absence of chaos .",
    "here we note that the classical dynamics does not achieve local mixing inside the remnant separatrix prior to the exit event in contrast with the analysis of bohigas _",
    "et al._@xcite which assumes that local mixing is well established before regions separated by partial transport barriers communicate with each other .",
    "thirdly , the tendril that results from the interaction of the flow with the hyperbolic fixed point  meaning the feature in the lagrangian manifold between the caustic and the false caustic in figs .  [ fig_dots](g ) and [ fig_dots](h)gets thinner and longer as a function of time .",
    "the tendril is thus acting like a closed curve in phase space whose enclosed area is conserved by liouville s theorem . neglecting the term @xmath82 that follows from the inexact cancellation of the time - dependent potential along the two paths@xcite ,",
    "the area `` enclosed '' by the tendril @xmath83 is indeed approximately given by the relative action between the two paths at the false caustic @xmath84 , where @xmath85 denote the coordinates of the false caustic .",
    "the false caustic is a fold in the lagrangian manifold that does not correspond to a turning point in the flow , meaning that the caustic count @xmath40 is not incremented by one there , but rather , is decremented by one .",
    "( in figure [ fig_dots](g ) the fold is actually just on the verge of forming . )",
    "particles do not flow around this fold as a function of time .",
    "rather , those in the immediate vicinity of the false caustic move rigidly with the manifold as it deforms .",
    "consequently , the quantity @xmath84 approaches a constant value as the gap between the two paths at the false caustic closes . since @xmath86",
    ", we see that the area - preserving nature of the flow that gives rise to the stretching of the tendril is closely tied to the existence of the false caustic in the lagrangian manifold .",
    "having discussed some general features of the classical flow , we now examine the corresponding quantum and classical probability densities shown in figs .",
    "[ fig_prob](a)-(h ) .",
    "we see that the classical and quantum distributions are essentially indistinguishable for @xmath87 but that this equivalence disappears once the tendril forms and the classical motion becomes unbounded ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "we should also point out that , while some of the particles appear to escape the well to the left at @xmath89 , they subsequently get pulled back inside ( see figs .  [",
    "fig_dots](c)-(e ) and figs .",
    "[ fig_prob](c)-(e ) ) . this spurious escape event , unlike the real event ,",
    "is not accompanied by any folding of the lagrangian manifold , and the equivalence of the quantum and classical distributions is preserved .    just prior to the departure of the quantum from the classical behavior at @xmath90",
    "we see that @xmath91 and @xmath92 are nearly coincident , as are the quantum and classical maxima .",
    "the caustic then moves off in the positive @xmath24-direction away from the hyperbolic fixed point , and the classical maximum follows .",
    "the quantum maximum , however , is left behind , stuck on top of the cosine barrier .",
    "this pinning of the quantum peak on the barrier , as a mechanism for the inhibition of mixing , is the key feature that we observe in the quantum chaotic dynamics of this system .",
    "we emphasize that this sticking or pinning phenomenon is not a result of the difference in quantum and classical transmission coefficients for a cosine barrier  which is negligible for our value of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , we find no appreciable difference between time - evolved quantum and classical probability densities when we scatter a gaussian wave packet off an isolated , rigid cosine barrier at the threshold energy . nor",
    "is the pinning caused by the side - to - side and/or up - and - down motion of an isolated potential barrier .",
    "if we mimic the oscillations in position and energy near the hyperbolic fixed point of the perturbed cosine potential with a potential barrier of the form @xmath93 , we again find no appreciable difference between the quantum and classical scattering at near - threshold energies .",
    "we conclude that the history of the wavepacket in the cosine well , particularly its delocalization prior to the escape event , is crucial in giving rise to the differences between the classical and quantum distributions that we observe .",
    "ironically , the delocalization of the wave packet is , in the following sense , related to eigenfunction localization .",
    "having noted that the classical phase space distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig_dots](a ) evolves to resemble the separatrix , or at least part of it , one might expect the corresponding time - evolved wave functions to resemble the near - threshold eigenstates of the unperturbed hamiltonian . quite generally ,",
    "for potentials with local maxima ( or saddle points in two or more dimensions ) at energies well above the ground state energy , the near - threshold eigenstates are highly peaked or `` localized '' at the potential energy maxima@xcite .",
    "this feature is clearly manifested in the wave functions of figs .",
    "[ fig_prob](e)-(h ) .",
    "the overlap of the still localized wave packet and the extended threshold eigenfunction is small in figs .",
    "[ fig_prob](a ) and [ fig_prob](b ) , but as the wave packet spreads out along the separatrix , the overlap increases .",
    "thus , the accumulation of amplitude at the hyperbolic fixed point represents the propensity for the chaotic dynamics to increase the overlap between the evolving wave function and the threshold eigenstates . in this sense ,",
    "the stickiness of the hyperbolic fixed point that gives rise to the pinning effect is a time - dependent manifestation of eigenfunction localization .",
    "the pinning effect can also be understood dynamically as a quantum interference effect between paths in the semiclassical propagator .",
    "to explain this we focus on the tendril feature in the region of the caustic just after the escape event ( at @xmath73 ) .",
    "we show the quantum and classical probability densities as well as the schulman / wkb approximation of eq .",

    "the agreement between the quantum distribution and the wkb approximation in fig .",
    "[ fig_detail](a ) clearly demonstrates that the structure of the wave function in the vicinity of the tendril has a semiclassical origin .",
    "specifically , the oscillatory nature of the wave function here is caused by interference between the two nearby paths that comprise the tendril .",
    "these paths do not contribute to the propagator independently , however , because of the proximity of their actions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_detail](c ) ) , which is why we must use schulman s approximation to the two - path wkb propagator to describe the interference properly .",
    "our semiclassical analysis is only valid in the region @xmath97 , however , because of the sudden divergence of the vvg amplitudes to the left of the false caustic ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig_detail](c ) ) .",
    "we observe similar agreement between the quantum distribution and schulman s approximation at @xmath98 and @xmath99 , although the presence of additional paths complicate matters somewhat in the latter case .",
    "the region for which @xmath100or equivalently , the region where schulman s propagator should replace the vvg propagator  grows directly with the length of the tendril .",
    "since the area enclosed by the tendril @xmath101 is roughly constant in time with @xmath102 , as explained above , it follows that the airy structure associated with the tendril simply gets stretched as the tendril is stretched . as a result ,",
    "the quantum peak remains near @xmath103 where it originated .",
    "the area - preserving nature of the chaotic hamiltonian flow , coupled with the presence of the false caustic in the lagrangian manifold , is thus responsible for the peak in the quantum distribution being held at the hyperbolic fixed point , thereby inhibiting the quantum transport of probability across the separatrix .",
    "we have shown that the quantum probability density rapidly diverges from that of the analogous classical system when the tendril formed by the interaction of the lagrangian manifold with the hyperbolic fixed point leads to ( classically ) unbounded motion .",
    "we have also shown that this divergence is the consequence of a quantum interference effect that pins the quantum peak associated with the caustic at the top of the potential barrier .",
    "this pinning effect is a concrete example of how quantum interference suppresses the exploration of `` phase space '' outside the broken separatrix to inhibit the classical mixing .",
    "the origin of the pinning effect was shown to be semiclassical , resulting from interference in the propagator between the direct and reflected paths associated with the tendril .",
    "we found it necessary to use an approximation to the wkb propagator due to schulman that is valid near caustics , rather than the van vleck - gutzwiller propagator , in order to study this interference properly .",
    "this is because the stretching of the tendril that accompanies the chaotic dynamics phase locks the entire region of phase space explored by the tendril in close proximity to the caustic .",
    "we approximate schulman s propagator by relating its asymptotic expansion to the van vleck - gutzwiller propagator .",
    "this avoids the untenable boundary value problem one must otherwise solve in order to calculate schulman s propagator directly .",
    "we have shown that schulman s propagator , evaluated in this way , accounts for the difference between the behavior of the quantum and classical systems at the times we consider .",
    "we emphasize that this interference occurs between direct and reflected paths , differing in gutzwiller phase by @xmath3in contrast with the interference effect discussed in ref .  .",
    "thus , we conclude that the interference between direct and reflected paths ( for these very early times ) has no permanent effect on the wave function as it sloshes back and forth in the potential well as long as the classical motion remains bounded  just as the structure that appears in a wave packet as it scatters off of a rigid barrier@xcite is temporary , disappearing once the packet is fully reflected .",
    "when the motion becomes unbounded , however , we have shown that the interference between direct and reflected paths in the tendril permanently modifies the wave function , profoundly affecting the quantum - classical equivalence that characterizes the dynamics prior to the exit time .",
    "we have shown that this divergence of the quantum and classical behavior is a direct consequence of the folding and stretching of the lagrangian manifold that accompanies the classical flow across the separatrix ; and this , in turn , is a direct consequence of the onset of the classical chaos .    because the pinning effect is directly related , in the semiclassical sense , to generic features of the classical hamiltonian chaos , we argue that this mechanism for the inhibition of mixing is itself generic .",
    "thus , one should expect to find the pinning effect in other weakly driven chaotic hamiltonian systems as well .",
    "moreover , since classical canonical perturbation theory and the kam theory for the origin of soft chaos are applicable for both time - dependent and time - independent perturbations@xcite , this mechanism should also appear in conservative ( hamiltonian ) systems characterized by soft chaos . lacking the time - dependence responsible for the false caustic in our problem ,",
    "we suspect that the higher order caustics ( where the caustic count @xmath40 changes by more than one ) that can exist in such systems because of the increased dimensionality would play the role of the false caustic in giving rise to the pinning effect .",
    "we can not go so far as to argue that the pinning effect is generic to all hamiltonian quantum chaos , however , because the presence of tendrils and either false caustics or ( possibly ) higher order caustics in the lagrangian manifold is not , by itself , sufficient to produce this feature .",
    "the partial barrier to classical phase space transport associated with the broken separatrix appears to be the more crucial element . while the strongly chaotic stadium billiard problem , for example , exhibits both higher order caustics @xcite and tendril - like structures ( see the two - dimensional birkhoff projection of the lagrangian manifold in ref .  ) , it does not possess the simple kam structures ( _ i.e. _ , the cantori or broken separatrices ) that act as partial barriers to transport@xcite . nor does the quantum system manifest the stretching of the exponential tail in the classically forbidden region ( or the associated pinning effect ) , or so we assume given the long - time accuracy of the vvg propagator achieved by heller and tomsovic for that problem mentioned in sec .",
