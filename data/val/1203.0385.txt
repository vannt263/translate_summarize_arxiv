    "there we considered atoms placed on a one - dimensional regular lattice - a situation which since very recently can also be achieved experimentally @xcite .",
    "we moreover assumed a perfect excitation blockade for neighboring sites , i.e. , no two neighboring atoms can be simultaneously excited to the rydberg state .",
    "for this simplified situation , we studied in particular the time - evolution of local observables such as the density of rydberg atoms and density - density correlation functions .",
    "we found that the temporal behavior of all of these observables is qualitatively similar : the short time dynamics is characterized by strong oscillations while for long times a steady state is established in which all quantities fluctuate with small amplitude around a constant value ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : universalregime]a ) .",
    "the focus of these previous works was on the long - time behavior , i.e. , on the investigation of the origin of this ( seemingly thermal ) steady state .",

    "we show that there are universal functions for the expectation values of general observables in the thermodynamic limit to which the results of finite systems converge at least logarithmically .",
    "this means that even the study of finite systems gives access to properties of the thermodynamic limit provided that the propagation time is sufficiently short .",
    "we discuss which observables exhibit this convergence to the universal behavior , and the validity of these results for systems with different geometries , interaction ranges and dimensions .",

    ", we calculate the rate of convergence to this thermodynamic limit and show that it is , at least , logarithmic .",
    "we provide a systematic procedure to obtain these universal functions using the particularly symmetric case of a ring lattice .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : h ] , we describe in detail the system under study and present a derivation of the hamiltonian that governs its dynamics . in section [ sec : general ] , we discuss the properties of the hamiltonian and their implications in the time - evolution of the expectation value of any general observable .",
    "in addition , we introduce some of the mathematical tools we will use throughout the remainder of the paper . in section [ sec : ring ] , we focus on the case of a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions and any blockade radius . here , we prove that the time - evolution of the expectation value of a set of operators ( including the rydberg density ) in a finite size system converges at least logarithmically for all times to a universal function ( i.e. , independent of the size of the system ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the technique to derive this universal function is also described here . in section [ sec : seg ] , we analyze the same system but with open boundary conditions and show that the results found in the periodic case are equally valid . finally , we discuss the generalization of these results to higher dimensions in section [ sec : dim ] . the conclusions and open problems",

    "univ ] , [ app : words ] and [ app : kappa ] , we provide the bulk of the mathematical proof of the existence of the universal functions and the convergence to those of the finite - size expectation values . in appendix",
    "[ app : matrixsegment ] , we present the method to create the matrix representation of some operators on the one - dimensional linear lattice .",
    "the system we are considering is a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath6 sites and spacing @xmath11 .",
    "each site shall contain a single atom which occupies the ( local ) vibrational ground state .",
    "the ground state @xmath12 and a highly excited ( rydberg ) state @xmath13 of each atom ( considered as two - level systems ) are coupled resonantly by means of a laser with rabi frequency @xmath14 .",

    "two different examples of domains are shown : nearest neighbors ( @xmath28 ) and next - nearest neighbors ( @xmath29 ) interaction .",
    "moreover , we consider the interaction between excited states so strong that within the corresponding domain only one atom can be excited to the rydberg state . ]    in the following we will perform two approximations which lead us to the perfect blockade model .",
    "first , we do not consider the full @xmath30-tail of the van - der - waals interaction but rather a cut - off at a radius @xmath31 , i.e. , only atoms on sites contained in the subset @xmath32 interact with an excited atom located at the @xmath22-th site ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian can then be rewritten as @xmath33 with @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "in addition , we assume that the interaction energy between atoms inside the radius @xmath36 - often referred to as the blockade radius - is much larger than the rabi frequency of the laser , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "this means in turn that the probability of having two atoms simultaneously excited within the set @xmath28 is strongly suppressed .",
    "these two assumptions can only be satisfied if @xmath38 note that these conditions are more difficult to meet the larger the number of sites inside the _ blockade _ radius @xmath36 .    in the next step",
    ", we make the excitation blockade manifest by transforming the hamiltonian into the interaction picture with the unitary operator @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this results in a new schrdinger equation with effective hamiltonian @xmath40 where we have used that @xmath41 . since @xmath42 ,",
    "all the terms contained in the sum over @xmath43 commute with @xmath44 .",
    "now , we have to calculate explicitly @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "note that @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath44 and @xmath48 are projectors onto the subspaces with a rydberg and a ground state atom on site @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "thus , one has @xmath49 next , we neglect in this expression the terms that oscillate with frequencies @xmath50 for all @xmath43 which under our initial assumption are much larger than the rabi frequency .",
    "this is the so - called rotating wave or secular approximation , and gives rise to the effective hamiltonian @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "this hamiltonian couples states differing in a single rydberg excitation , but the factor @xmath53 prevents the creation of a rydberg excitation at site @xmath22 whenever there is another already present at some site @xmath43 .",
    "the natural initial state of the system is the one with all atoms in the ground state , i.e. , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the hamiltonian then only couples @xmath56 to states which have eigenvalue @xmath57 with respect to all @xmath53 . as a consequence , only states with at most one excitation inside the neighborhoods @xmath58 are accessible by a time - evolution under @xmath59 .",
    "the generalization of the previous arguments to higher dimensional lattices leads to a hamiltonian of the same form as . the higher dimensional version of condition [ eqn : b - cond ] is , however , more difficult to satisfy .",
    "for instance , in the case of a blockade radius @xmath60 , reads @xmath61 , while for a 2-dimensional square and a 3-dimensional cubic lattices , it becomes the more stringent condition @xmath62 .",
    "we would like to remark that even when the conditions for the validity of the effective hamiltonian [ eqn : heff ] are not strictly satisfied , such a hamiltonian provides a first approximation to the dynamics of a rydberg lattice gas which can be corrected by perturbation techniques .    in the next sections",
    ", we will mathematically prove that the dynamics of a system driven by the hamiltonian [ eqn : heff ] exhibits some universal features , which do not depend on the lattice geometry or the interaction range .",
    "our analysis begins by discussing a property of the system that holds regardless of the geometry of the lattice : the operator @xmath63 , with @xmath64 being the total number of atoms in the rydberg state , satisfies @xmath65 which in turn yields @xmath66 this anticommutation relation implies that @xmath59 only couples states whose total number of rydberg excitations have opposite parity @xmath63 . although @xmath63 is not a symmetry of @xmath59 , the fact that both operators anticommute has some implications in the corresponding spectrum and dynamics .",
    "first , if @xmath67 is an eigenvector of @xmath59 with eigenvalue @xmath68 , the state @xmath69 is also an eigenvector , but with eigenvalue @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , the energy spectrum of @xmath59 is symmetric with respect to @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , any eigenvector @xmath67 with eigenvalue @xmath72 must be orthogonal to @xmath69 .",
    "thus , @xmath73 , which yields @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the projections of @xmath67 onto the subspaces with even and odd total number of rydberg states , respectively .",
    "we conclude from this that any eigenvector of @xmath59 with non zero eigenvalue has equal probability of having an odd or even number of rydberg excitations .    for some particular choices of the lattice geometry and the blockade range @xmath28 , the system and its hamiltonian @xmath59 possess additional symmetries .",
    "for instance , in the case of a ring lattice ( one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions ) the system is invariant under translations and reversal of the sites .",
    "any symmetry of the system splits the state space into several @xmath59-invariant subspaces ( the eigenspaces of the symmetry ) , decoupling the evolution into lower dimensional ones with the same spectral properties described previously for @xmath59 .",
    "if this symmetry also commutes with @xmath63 , the corresponding subspaces are @xmath63-invariant too . as a consequence , any odd - dimensional subspace which is simultaneously invariant for @xmath59 and @xmath63 must enclose a zero energy eigenstate of @xmath59",
    ". otherwise , the number of orthogonal eigenvectors of the reduced hamiltonian should be even due to the symmetry of its spectrum with respect to the origin .",
    "the anticommutation relation [ eqn : anticomm ] also bears implications for the dynamics . in the heisenberg picture",
    "the evolution of any observable @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 .",
    "the evolution of this arbitrary observable @xmath77 is an entire function of @xmath79 , i.e. , an analytic function on the whole complex plane when @xmath79 is considered as a complex variable , so that its power series must converge for any value of @xmath79 .",
    "the corresponding power series expansion yields @xmath80 where we have defined the adjoint endomorphism @xmath81_j=\\left[h,[h , a]_{j-1}\\right ] , \\qquad\\mathrm{ad}^0_h(a)\\equiv a.\\ ] ] let us assume that @xmath82=0 $ ] , i.e. , the operator @xmath77 conserves the parity of the number of excitations .",
    "then , the relation [ eqn : anticomm ] yields @xmath83 if @xmath84 and @xmath67 are two eigenstates of @xmath85 with total number of rydberg states @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , the matrix element @xmath88 satisfies @xmath89 as a consequence , @xmath88 is an even or an odd function of @xmath79 depending whether @xmath86 and @xmath87 have the same parity or not .",
    "setting @xmath90 , we find that the expectation value of @xmath77 starting from an initial state with a definite number of rydberg excitations is an even function of @xmath79 .",
    "we now apply these results to the time - evolution of the expectation value of the total number of rydberg atoms @xmath85 .",
    "we consider the initial state @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath91 , so that @xmath92 . by using , we see that only the even terms contribute to the expansion : @xmath93 the first term of the sum is proportional to @xmath94 and can be calculated using the algebra of @xmath20 and @xmath21 as @xmath95=\\omega \\sum_k ( r_k - r_k^\\dag ) m_k\\\\    & & \\mathrm{ad}_{h}^{2}\\!(n)=[h,[h , n]]= 2\\omega^2\\sum_k ( n_k - m_k ) m_k\\\\    & & \\kern30pt + 2 \\omega^2 \\sum_k \\sum_{j\\in\\lambda_k } ( r_j r_k^\\dag - r_j^\\dag r_k )   m_j m_{k \\setminus j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath96 .",
    "taking the expectation value in the last expression we obtain @xmath97 and in the expansion [ eqn : seriesn ] the first coefficient is @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the expectation value of the rydberg density defined as @xmath99 is an even function of @xmath79 with the universal behavior @xmath100 , regardless of the dimension or the geometry of the lattice , and for any blockade range .",
    "_ in the remainder of the paper we will search for such a universality ( independence of the size of the system ) in higher terms of the series expansion of @xmath101 , as well as for expectation values of other operators . _",
    "to tackle this task , we will extensively use the following property : if @xmath77 and @xmath102 are self - adjoint , @xmath103 is self - adjoint or anti self - adjoint depending on whether @xmath104 is even or odd .",

    "@xmath137 and performing the anti - symmetrization finally results in @xmath138 as we can see , the level of complexity of the terms @xmath139 increases very quickly .",

    "in addition , let us emphasize that the ring lattice is not merely a useful model to simplify the computations due to the symmetries , but also allows us to obtain the exact coefficients of the power expansion .",
    "that is , it grants us access to the universal behavior of the system independently of the lattice geometry , as it is discussed in the next section .",
    "we will now investigate a one - dimensional lattice with open boundary conditions .",

    "the analysis of the short time dynamics is similar to the ring lattice but the boundary effects are more pronounced .",
    "the reason is that , contrary to the ring , the atoms located at the edges of the line notice the boundary conditions at any time .",
    "however , the theoretical approach followed previously in case of the ring can be extended also to this case .",

    "it can be expanded as in expression [ eqn : rho_l ] , but the for the coefficient @xmath118 of @xmath255 is no longer valid because the linear lattice has no translation invariance .",
    "only the invariance under reflection remains , so that the contributions of the sites @xmath22 and @xmath256 coincide .",
    "therefore , in the coefficients @xmath257 the contribution of each site @xmath22 must be computed independently .",
    "the first coefficient @xmath258 is proportional to the expectation value @xmath259 .",
    "first , we need @xmath260 $ ] , and to calculate it we follow the same route as in the ring when @xmath261 , since for @xmath262 and @xmath6 , one has @xmath263 and @xmath264 , respectively . generalizing this for any @xmath22 , it yields @xmath265 in the same spirit , one can write the operator @xmath266 $ ] with @xmath253 , and @xmath267 , so that remains valid for any @xmath22 .",
    "from here we obtain again that @xmath268 for any @xmath22 and @xmath269 this result was expected because we know that the @xmath94 behavior of the expectation value for the rydberg density is independent of the geometry of the lattice .",
    "the previous arguments show that the coefficients of the power series expansion of the rydberg density on the linear lattice can be inferred from the @xmath139 on the ring by setting @xmath253 and @xmath270 if @xmath271 or @xmath272 .",
    "this rule not only simplifies the calculation but at the same time provides a direct comparison with the ring and its universal rydberg density . following this recipe we find that the next two coefficients are @xmath273 hence , except for @xmath258 , the coefficients @xmath118 are not universal , even for large @xmath6 .",
    "however , for @xmath6 sufficiently large , all sites give the same contribution to the @xmath104-th coefficient , except for the @xmath274 sites counted from either end of the lattice .",
    "for each of these boundary sites , a fraction @xmath275 of the universal contribution is missing due to the condition @xmath270 if @xmath271 or @xmath272 . hence , we can rewrite @xmath276 where @xmath277 .",

    "this result can be checked with an alternative computation of @xmath280 for concrete values of @xmath6 , using the matrix representation of @xmath122 and @xmath179 developed in appendix [ app : matrixsegment ] .",

    "furthermore , @xmath150 also converges for any @xmath79 to the universal rydberg density @xmath101 .",
    "the reason is that this convergence in the ring is simply a consequence of a bound for @xmath118 given by an overestimation of the number of _ words _ in @xmath283 contributing to @xmath118 ( see appendix [ app : words ] ) . since the linear lattice reduces the number of such words due to the conditions @xmath270 for @xmath271 and @xmath272 , the bound holds here too . as a consequence",
    ", we also expect the presence of a universal short time regime with a range that increases with the size of the system .",
    "a comparison between the rydberg density for a @xmath180 linear lattice and the universal rydberg density including terms with @xmath284 , i.e. , @xmath182 , is presented in .",
    "these results can be generalized to other operators and other blockade ranges .",
    "for completeness , we provide some ideas on the generalization of these results to systems of higher dimensions .",
    "the analogue of a one - dimensional ring lattice of size @xmath6 in higher dimensions is a toroidal lattice defined by the periodic boundary conditions @xmath285 for any spatial basis vector @xmath286 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath118 of the rydberg density will depend not only on the blockade radius but also on the dimension of the system .",
    "higher dimensional lattices yield different quantitative results for non - integer values of @xmath240 due to the presence of neighbors at non - integer distances , absent in the one - dimensional case . nevertheless , the short time behavior will be qualitatively similar : the first taylor coefficients of the expectation value of a ( @xmath6-independent or translationally invariant ) operator are universal for @xmath6 large enough because the corresponding commutators involve sites with a relative distance not greater than @xmath6 . furthermore , the number of universal coefficients increases linearly with @xmath6 . as in the one - dimensional case ,",
    "these universality properties are affected by non - periodic boundary conditions ( e.g. , square and cubic lattices ) : the coefficients differ from the universal ones by @xmath287 terms because , for large @xmath6 , the number of boundary sites is of order @xmath288 compared with the total number of sites of the lattice .    hence , we can at least formally define a power series expansion that represents the universal time evolution of expectation values of operators such as the rydberg density .",
    "however , the reasoning used earlier in this paper to prove that this series actually defines a function ( i.e. , that the power series with the universal coefficients is convergent ) does not apply to dimensions larger than one . the cornerstone of such methods is the bound obtained for the taylor coefficients by overestimating the _ words _ generated when applying @xmath289 to the corresponding operator ( see appendix [ app : words ] ) .",
    "the number of such words grows exponentially with the dimension , which renders the techniques useless in dimension 2 or higher .",
    "this , of course , does not mean that there exists no such function as the universal rydberg density in higher dimensions .",
    "in fact , its existence was proven previously in ref .",
    "@xcite although the method to calculate the corresponding universal function remains , to the best of our knowledge , unknown .",
    "in this work we have shown that expectation values of observables in a one - dimensional rydberg lattice gas converge to universal time dependent functions in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this convergence takes place for any time , for any size - independent or translationally invariant observable , for any blockade radius , and for open and periodic boundary conditions . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the universality can be understood as an asymptotic behavior when the size of the lattice goes to infinity .",
    "the expectation values of the considered operators converge ( at least logarithmically ) to some universal ones which could be associated to a model living in an infinite lattice .",
    "we have also shown how to obtain the expansion coefficients of these universal functions by investigating the dynamics on a ring lattice .",
    "the difficulty in the analysis of this asymptotics stems from the fact that such infinite lattice model is not well defined since the corresponding hamiltonian has no meaning as an operator on a hilbert space .",
    "higher dimensional lattices also share in general these properties and the expectation values actually converge to universal ones as the lattice size increases .",
    "the universal expectation values given this asymptotics depend only on the operator at hand , the blockade radius , and the dimension of the lattice , but not on its particular geometry .    from the practical point of view the results presented in this paper",
    "mean that even the simulation of small systems allow to gain accurate insights into the behavior of macroscopic many - body systems , provided that the simulation time is sufficiently short , so that boundary effects are negligible .",
