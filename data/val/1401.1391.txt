    "transport and diffusion in highly heterogeneous random media is an interesting and complex phenomenon occurring in a wide class of materials , ranging from rocks to clouds , to engineered experimental samples @xcite .",
    "matter or light typically crosses disordered regions with very different diffusion properties , so that the transport process can be described as a lvy walk : motion consists of a sequence of scatterings followed by long jumps in the nonscattering regions .",
    "two concurrent effects make the problem particularly hard : the quenched randomness , inducing correlation between displacements , and , if the material is heterogeneous on all scales , the typical broad distribution of the steps length , that can be heavy - tailed and lvy distributed .    tunable media with lvy like properties @xcite , reproducing all these effects ,",
    "are an interesting testbed for the typically superdiffusive motion occurring in heterogeneous random materials .",
    "the `` lvy '' glasses are obtained by a packing of polydispersed glass spheres with lvy distributed radii and embedded in a scattering matrix . as light",
    "is scattered only in the inter - sphere regions and freely travels ballistically inside the spheres , the propagation of light in these materials can be described as a correlated lvy walk , with step length distribution @xmath0 , where the parameter @xmath1 can be tuned by choosing an appropriate distribution of radii for the polydispersed spheres . in these systems ,",
    "a superdiffusive behavior has been observed , with the characteristic length of the dynamical process growing as @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "a theoretical study of such systems is in general a non trivial task due to topological correlations between the step lengths : e.g. after crossing a large sphere a walker is likely backscattered in the same ballistic region . in this perspective",
    ", different theoretical and numerical approaches have been proposed @xcite .",
    "an analytic solution has been obtained for the simpler one dimensional case , the so called lvy - lorentz gas , corresponding to a packing of segments of lvy distributed lengths separated by scattering centers @xcite ; in that case the dynamical exponent is @xmath4 ( superdiffusion ) for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( standard diffusion ) for @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the regular and deterministic self similar version of the lvy packings in higher dimension @xcite have been recently introduced as basic geometrical models for quenched lvy structures .",
    "also in that case , numerical simulations show superdiffusion for @xmath8 and standard diffusion for @xmath7 , with the dynamical exponent @xmath9 depending on @xmath1 , and very slightly on the dynamical rule and on the spatial dimension .",
    "conversely , recent numerical results on @xmath10 and @xmath11dimensional random sphere packings @xcite evidenced important differences with previous results . in particular superdiffusion was observed also for @xmath7 , i.e. for @xmath12 .",
    "however , some aspects remained unclear , in particular the anomalous non monotonic behavior of @xmath9 as a function of @xmath1 , and the evaluation of the finite size effects @xcite .",
    "notice that , for these random high dimensional heterogeneous models , even the definition of the packing procedure is a complex problem , still not understood from the theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "what seems clear is that the dynamical behavior observed in all these lvy quenched structures differs from the standard uncorrelated lvy walk , where anomalous superdiffusion is present for @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "another important point in the numerical experiments performed so far is that the samples are built by optimizing the packing , and minimizing the scattering region ( optimal filling approach ) . in this way ,",
    "the average distance between the spheres is kept constant as the system size grows , reproducing the behavior of deterministic fractals @xcite . within this prescription ,",
    "the density of scatterers ( or turbid fraction ) , for @xmath8 , becomes infinitesimal as the size goes to infinity , as one is building a so called slim fractal .",
    "conversely , in the samples produced for the experiments @xcite the turbid fraction is kept constant at different sizes even for @xmath14 , and this may give rise to important differences with respect the optimized lvy structures of the theoretical approaches .    in this paper we first present an extensive numerical and theoretical analysis of two dimensional random packings of disks with radii distributed according to a lvy law , and packed by minimizing the turbid fraction , i.e. with the optimal filling approach .",
    "our results provide a new interpretation of the data found in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the anomalous non monotonic behavior of the dynamical exponent @xmath9 can be interpreted as a failure of the packing procedure in the regime @xmath15 . moreover , numerical simulations show that in the thermodynamic limit of infinitely large samples the superdiffusive regimes observed for @xmath16 are expected to disappear and converge to a behavior similar to the deterministic case , where @xmath3 only for @xmath8 . in this framework we evidence that for @xmath17 strong finite size effects characterize the dynamics , the radii distribution and the packing procedure .",
    "we define the exponent @xmath18 , describing such geometrical preasymptotic behavior , and we show that @xmath18 can be used for an effective description of the size effects characterizing the dynamics of realistic finite samples .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect on the dynamics of the scattering length and of the truncation of the radii distribution .",
    "then , in order to make contact with the experiments , we consider the case of disks packing obtained by keeping the filling fraction constant at all scales , instead of minimizing the turbid fraction .",
    "this analysis evidences that , for any value of @xmath1 , as the size of the systems grows , the dynamical exponent @xmath9 becomes closer to 2 , and we infer that the system is experiencing a crossing from a superdiffusive to a diffusive regime , with a large crossover region where superdiffusive effects can appear .",
    "the evidence is corroborated by analyzing the response of the dynamical exponents to the change of the scattering mean free path length and the fixed filled fraction @xmath19 .",
    "we remark that such a crossover from ballistic to diffusive behavior is also present in the case where all the spheres have the same radius @xcite .",

    "we introduce the dynamics and the optimized packing procedure . in section [ sec : ff ] we study the geometrical properties of the samples , introducing the effective exponent .",
    "we then show the results of our dynamical simulations and scaling effects in section [ sec : dynamics ] .",

    "the filling fraction @xmath19 at size @xmath29 is defined as the ratio between the total volume of the disks placed in the sample , @xmath30 , and the total volume @xmath31 of the sample : @xmath32 the complementary of @xmath19 is the turbid fraction @xmath33 , that is , the system volume fraction occupied by the scatterers .",
    "we introduce two different packing procedures illustrated in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : drop_n_roll ] . in the first ,",
    "the newly added disk is approached to its closest neighbor , in the second it is also rotated around the neighboring disk until it is still not overlapping with the rest of the systems @xcite .",

    "[ fig : drop_n_roll ] ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the data clearly show that both prescriptions give the same qualitative result , presenting only a small improvement in the filling fraction . therefore ,",
    "hereafter , we adopt the original procedure which is the less demanding from a computational point of view .",
    "an example of a disks packing produced by this algorithm is found in fig .",
    "[ fig : sistema ] .",
    "we then implement the specific dynamics of transport in the packing .",
    "the rays of light experience a ballistic motion inside the disks and an isotropic poisson process in between the spheres , i.e. in the turbid region .",

    "if the ray crosses one or more disks , the actual step length has to be incremented until the ending point belongs to the turbid region and the new step length becomes @xmath37 ( @xmath38 is the spaced covered within the disks ) .",

    "the particles then walk as long as they reach the opposite side of the slab ( @xmath44 ) or until they are backscattered to the @xmath43 surface ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sistema ] ) . for the measure of the probability distribution @xmath45 and of the mean square displacement , we pack the disks with periodic boundary conditions and the starting point is chosen randomly in the turbid fraction .",
    "we let the maximum radius range from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , with @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 .",

    "<S> we consider transport and scaling properties in samples packed with two different procedures , at fixed filling fraction and at self - similar packing , and we clarify the role of the two procedures in the superdiffusive effects . </S>",
    "<S> using the behavior of the filling fraction in finite size systems as the main geometrical parameter , we define an effective lvy exponents that correctly estimate the finite size effects . </S>",
    "<S> the effective lvy exponent rules the dynamical scaling of the main transport properties and identify the region where superdiffusive effects can be detected . </S>"
