    "there exist several types of electron localizations in condensed matter physics . in the presence of disorder or impurities",
    ", waves can be localized due to quantum interference , which is generally known as the anderson localization @xcite . in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system carriers",
    "are expected @xcite to be always localized with the resistance diverging either logarithmically ( `` weak localization '' ) or exponentially ( `` strong localization '' ) as @xmath1 . a different kind of localization involves the self - trapping of small polarons in strong electron - phonon interacting systems .",
    "both types of localizations here mainly concern non - interacting or weakly correlated electrons .    in the high-@xmath2 cuprates ,",
    "the undoped system is a mott insulator , in which the charge degree of freedom is totally frozen out by strong on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "its spins form an antiferromagnetic long range order ( aflro ) at low temperatures , which quickly collapses upon hole - doping @xcite . at small concentration , @xmath3 , the doped holes as charge carriers remain localized with the low-@xmath4 resistivity well fit @xcite by those of traditional variable - range - hopping ( vrh ) type , usually applicable to doped semiconductors .",
    "only when the hole concentration exceeds @xmath5 will the charge carriers be truly delocalized , where the ground state becomes a d - wave superconducting state .    but lightly doped high-@xmath2 cuprates are of no conventional doped semiconductors . here",
    "they are doped mott insulators with the majority of the charge degree of freedom still remaining frozen .",
    "the strongly correlated effect should thus play a crucial role in the charge transport .",
    "the issue why doped holes should be always localized at small doping and how they eventually become delocalized with increasing doping is a very important question , which may also be relevant to understanding the microscopic mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprates .",
    "recently , a new kind of self - localization , which can be particularly attributed to the mott physics , has been proposed @xcite , in which the _ pure _ coulomb interaction is responsible for the self - localization of electrons near half - filling",
    ". here disorder or impurities is no longer as essential as in the anderson localization , although they may be helpful to induce a true translational symmetry breaking at @xmath6 .",
    "such a self - localization of holes is caused by the phase - string effect @xcite , referring to a stringlike defect left by the hopping of a hole , which is _ irreparable _ in the ground state of the @xmath7 model no matter whether there is an aflro or not at _ arbitrary _ doping .",
    "furthermore , it has been also shown @xcite that the charge localization does not contradict to the photoemission experiments @xcite in which the observed `` quasiparticle '' dispersion in the single - particle spectral function can be well accounted for in terms of the `` spinon dispersion '' .    in principle , it is not surprising that due to the separation @xcite of spin and charge degrees of freedom in a doped mott insulator , the charge carriers will get localized at low doping by scattering with fluctuations from an independent of degrees of freedom . in fact , in a different gauge - theory approach to the @xmath7 model , the localization of charge carriers has been also obtained @xcite , by scattering to the gauge fluctuations .    in this paper , we study such a self - localization phenomenon based on an effective phase - string description @xcite of the @xmath7 model .",
    "we shall focus on the spin ordered phase ( not necessarily long - range ordered ) at very low doping and explore the unique charge self - localization behavior .",
    "as shown previously , a doped hole in such a regime will induce @xcite a dipole - like spin structure .",
    "we find that the kinetic energy of the hole is severely frustrated by the phase string effect such that the hole - dipole is self - trapped in real space .",
    "we discuss the corresponding transport properties and show that the thermopower saturates to a heikes - like formula as the result .",
    "while the resistivity exhibits a mott - vrh - like behavior at low temperatures , the collapse of the hole - dipole composites and the release of free `` holons '' at high - temperatures will lead to a strange - metal - like behavior there .",
    "furthermore , the existence of the hole dipolar structure predicts a large doping - dependent dielectric constant , which diverges at the deconfinement .",
    "all of these properties seem to paint a consistent picture for the complex transport and dielectric phenomena observed in the high-@xmath2 cuprates .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the self - localization of doped holes in the spin ordered phase at low doping based on the phase - string model .",
    "a renormalization group ( rg ) analysis will be used to determine the phase diagram . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the experimental implications of the self - localization , including the thermopower , resistivity and dielectric constant , and make comparisons with experimental measurements . finally , the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "we shall adopt the phase - string model as the microscopic description of how doped holes move in an antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulator .",
    "this model is obtained @xcite as a low - energy effective theory based on the @xmath7 model , which can accurately describe af correlations at half - filling and possesses a d - wave superconducting ground state at doping concentrations larger than @xmath8 ( @xmath9 at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "what we will be interested in the following is the non - superconducting phase below the critical doping @xmath11 where an aflro or a spin glass state persists at low temperatures .",
    "the existence of such a non - superconducting phase is the consequence that the _ long - range _ af correlations ( not necessarily aflro ) win in the competition with the kinetic energy of holes at sufficiently low doping . in the phase - string model",
    ", this phase will be characterized by the `` spinon condensation '' . in the following",
    ", we shall analyze in detail the behavior of doped holes in this low - doping regime and demonstrate that the charge carriers must be self - localized in the ground state , resulting a spontaineous translational symmetry breaking .",
    "we start with the phase - string model @xmath12 which is composed @xcite of two terms : the charge degree of freedom as characterized by the `` holon '' term    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and the `` holon '' operator , @xmath15 is bosonic ; the spin degrees of freedom as described by the `` spinon '' term @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the `` spinon '' operator , @xmath18 is also bosonic .",
    "basic features of this model are as follows . at half filling , the gauge field @xmath19 can be set to zero in eq.([hs ] ) and @xmath20 reduces to the schwinger - boson mean - field hamiltonian @xcite , which describes both the long - range and short - range af correlations fairly well . upon doping , @xmath21 is no longer trivial as it satisfies a topological constraint : @xmath22 ( @xmath23 denotes the area enclosed by @xmath24 ) with @xmath25 denoting the `` holon '' number at site @xmath26 which is interpreted as that each `` holon '' behaves like a @xmath27-fluxoid as felt by the `` spinons '' .",
    "thus , @xmath19 will play the key role of frustrations introduced by holes that act on the spin degrees of freedom .",
    "similarly , the `` holons '' are also subjected to frustrations from the spin background , through the gauge field @xmath28 in eq.([hh ] ) . here",
    "@xmath29 satisfies a topological constraint : @xmath30 with @xmath31 denoting the `` spinon '' ( with index @xmath32 ) number at site @xmath26 which can be interpreted as that each `` spinon '' behaves like a @xmath33-fluxoid as perceived by the `` holons '' .",
    "the spin and charge degrees of freedom are thus mutually `` entangled '' in the phase - string model @xmath34 based on two topological gauge fields , @xmath19 and @xmath28 .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if the holons ( which are bosons ) experience a bose condensation at larger doping , the spinons , which behave as vortices according to @xmath28 , must be `` confined '' at low temperatures .",
    "such a `` spinon confining phase '' actually corresponds to the d - wave superconducting phase in the model . here",
    ", the spinon confinement occurring in the _ spin degree of freedom _ is closely related to the superconducting phase coherence in the _ charge degree of freedom_.    in contrast , if the spinons ( which are also bosons ) are bose condensed at low doping , free holons as `` vortices '' can not live alone either , and must be also `` confined '' @xcite .",
    "such a _ spinon condensed phase _ is thus also known as `` holon confining phase '' , _  _ which constitutes a non - superconducting solution of the phase - string model in the lightly doped regime . in the following",
    ", we will demonstrate how holons will get self - trapped in real space in such a phase .",
    "the spin ordered phase as characterized by the spinon condensation is therefore intimately related to the charge self - localization ( holon confining ) .",
    "schematically illustrates the above - mentioned two phases at different doping concentrations .     by the phase - string effect , carrying dipolar spin configurations .",
    "holes become delocalized at @xmath35 , with the critical doping concentration @xmath36 ( see text ) . ]",
    "let us recall that at half - filling , the bose condensation of spinons , @xmath37 will naturally gives rise to an aflro lying in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane @xcite with @xmath40 .",
    "however , once a hole is added into such an ordered state , the energy cost associated with a _ bare _ holon , if the condensation ( [ b ] ) remains unchanged , would become _ logarithmic ally divergent _ in terms of @xmath20@xcite @xmath41 ^2   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "_ _ supercurrent_. such a spin supercurrent can then screen out the effect of the `` magnetic fluxes '' introduced by @xmath21 in @xmath46 just like the flux - quantization phenomenon in a superconductor , such that the resulting _ renormalized _ holon will acquire a finite self - energy . in the following ,",
    "we show how this screening effect takes place in the phase - string model ( [ hs ] ) .",
    "define @xmath47 if @xmath48 @xmath49 sublattice , and @xmath50 if @xmath51 @xmath52 sublattice , with @xmath53 here @xmath54 denotes the spinon `` superfluid '' density .",
    "then the condensed part of @xmath20 can be written as @xmath55 in the continuum limit , where @xmath56 @xmath57 and @xmath58 denotes the nearest neighboring sites .",
    "the spin supercurrent , defined by @xmath59 then reads    @xmath60    where @xmath61    generally one expects a complicated distribution of the spin current nearby a holon .",
    "but in a distance far away from the holon , the supercurrent @xmath62 should vanish in order to ensure the finiteness of the energy cost introduced by a holon .",
    "the same requirement has been used in a superconductor to realize the flux quantization . by contrast , here we are dealing with the `` flux - quantization '' in a two - component superfluid problem with an internal gauge freedom .    by requiring the spin supercurrent @xmath63 vanish at the boundary @xmath64 such that @xmath65 one arrives at    @xmath66    note that @xmath67 . by introducing a unit vector @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the pauli matrix and @xmath70 one",
    "can straightforwardly show that @xmath71 thus , eq.([fq0 ] ) finally reduces to the following `` flux - quantization '' condition @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total number of doped holes .",
    "therefore , in the spinon condensed state , a holon will always induce a `` screening '' response from the spinon condensate , which is of topological nature satisfying the `` flux - quantization '' condition ( [ fq4 ] ) , meaning that each holon will `` nucleate '' a spin `` meron '' configuration with a topological charge @xmath74 such a meron configuration may be pictured as a spin vortex with the unit vector @xmath75 lying in a spin @xmath38-@xmath39 plane at a distance far away from the core , while , near the core , the unit vector @xmath76 starts to tilt away from the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane and points towards the @xmath77-axis at the core center , which covers one half of the unit sphere spanned by @xmath75 once , in contrast to a skyrmion which covers the whole unit sphere exactly once with @xmath78    finally we note that such _ holon - induced _ merons are called _ antimerons _ in the earlier approach @xcite because a holon itself also carries a meron ( vortex ) in the _ original spin space_. to see this , let us recall that in the phase - string model , the spin operators are expressed in terms of spinon operators by @xcite @xmath79   \\label{s+}\\ ] ] and @xmath80 @xmath81 in the spinon condensed phase , one has @xmath82 ,   \\label{s+1}\\ ] ] which is twisted away from an aflro lying in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane by the vortices centered at holons as determined by @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 but eq.([s+1 ] ) describes an _ bare _ holon effect which would result in a divergent self - energy of the holon as shown in eq.([des ] ) . in order to compensate such a vortex configuration associated with a bare holon",
    ", the condensed spinon fields have to be twisted into    @xmath85   \\label{bmeron}\\ ] ]    with an _ antimeron _ configuration @xmath86@xcite , which is characterized just by @xmath87 in the present approach , satisfying the `` flux - quantization '' condition ( [ fq4 ] ) .",
    "therefore , in the phase - string model , a renormalized holon is a composite with a bare holon bound to an induced antimeron as demonstrated above , while in the _ original spin space _ , it is an object composed of a meron ( holon ) and an antimeron , forming a _ dipole _ @xcite .",
    "two descriptions are equivalent .      according to the above analysis",
    ", the infinite self - energy of a bare holon in the spinon condensed phase can be removed by `` nucleating '' a topological spin antimeron configuration .",
    "this induced antimeron is an infinite - size semiclassical object which can not propagate based on @xmath88 thus , holons will be self - trapped around the cores of these antimerons .",
    "due to the translational symmetry , these induced antimerons can be located anywhere in space and therefore will result in a _ spontaneous translational symmetry breaking _ in the spinon condensed phase .",
    "physically , such a self - localization of charge carriers in the low - doping regime can be attributed to the irreparable phase - string effect created by the motion of holes , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the phase - string model provides a mathematical framework to conveniently handle this effect . in this description ,",
    "the locations of the antimeron and the holon inside a dipole constitute the starting and ending points of the motion of a holon , and the phase - string connecting such two points has relaxed into a dipolar picture , with a remaining branch - cut connecting two poles @xcite .",
    "if one tries to move away the bare holon from the core of the induced antimeron , the uncompensated spin supercurrent @xmath63 will increase the self - energy , representing an attractive potential which binds the bare holon to the antimeron . according to refs.@xcite ,",
    "such a potential can be estimated by @xmath89 at @xmath90 , where @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the distance between the holon and antimeron . at @xmath93 , @xmath94 diverges in consistency with eq.([des ] ) .",
    "when there are many holon - antimeron dipoles , one expects to see a _ screening _ _ effect _ on the confining potential by reducing @xmath94 to @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the dielectric constant .",
    "previously it has been shown @xcite that with the increase of doping concentration , eventually a transition at @xmath6 takes place , as @xmath97 or @xmath98 , from the holon self - localization ( confining ) phase to a delocalization ( deconfining ) phase at @xmath99 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . on the other hand , with the increase of temperature ,",
    "neutral vortex - antivortex pairs like those in the @xmath100 model can also be thermally excited , leading to a conventional contribution to the screening effect .",
    "to distinguish such two kinds of vortex - antivortex pairs , we shall call a dipole associated with a holon as a charged pair and the other kind as a neutral pair . in the following",
    ", we shall treat the screening effect due to both charged and neutral dipoles on an equal footing based on an rg treatment @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the conventional kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) theory @xcite , here the number of vortex - antivortex pairs remains finite even at @xmath101 where it is equal to @xmath102 ( _ i.e. , _ the number of holons ) .",
    "the probability for the neutral dipoles with two poles separated by a distance @xmath103 is controlled by the neutral pair fugacity @xmath104 . in the conventional kt theory @xcite , the initial @xmath105 , ( where @xmath106 and the core energy @xmath107 ) .",
    "but since the charged dipole number will be always fixed at @xmath108 per site , the probability for the charged dipoles is no longer governed by the fugacity @xmath109 , ( where @xmath110 denotes its core energy ) . instead",
    ", the initial fugacity must be adjusted accordingly and @xmath111 will turn out to be no longer so important @xcite .    in an rg procedure , the contributions from the dipoles with the sizes between @xmath103 and @xmath112 will be integrated out , starting from *  * @xmath113 .",
    "the renormalization effect is then represented by three renormalized quantities , @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 , which satisfy the following famous recursion relations @xcite @xmath117 where @xmath118 .",

    "what makes the present approach different from the conventional kt theory is the presence of a finite density of the charged dipoles ( holon - antimeron pairs ) . here , by noting @xmath126 as the areal density of charged pairs of sizes between @xmath103 and @xmath112 @xcite",

    "previously we have also shown that a superconducting phase will set in beyond @xmath157 where delocalized bosonic holons will experience a bose condensation at low temperatures@xmath158",
    "the spontaneous translational symmetry breaking in a lightly doped mott insulator has very unique experimental consequences . in such a system , since each doped hole can be self - trapped anywhere in space , due to the translational symmetry of the original hamiltonian , there will be a _",
    "large _ and _  doping - dependent entropy _ associated with the energetically degenerate configurations of holes in real - space distribution .",
    "such an anomalous entropy associated with the charge carriers can be directly probed in a thermopower measurement .    it has been previously known @xcite that for charge carriers in a narrow band , when the temperature is raised to exceed the bandwidth , the thermopower will be saturated to a @xmath4-independent constant , which is entirely determined by the entropy change per added carrier .",
    "namely , the thermopower @xmath159 at high-@xmath4 will reduce to @xmath160 where @xmath161 denotes the chemical potential , @xmath162 the entropy , and @xmath163 the total electron number .",
    "the subscript @xmath164 here means that the partial derivative is under a constant energy .",
    "the self - localization of doped holes means a vanishing bandwidth of the charge carriers and a spontaneous translational symmetry breaking with a lot of degenerate real - space configurations in the distribution of holes .",
    "the formula ( [ se ] ) can be directly applied in such a case based on a general thermodynamic consideration .",
    "putting @xmath165 hole on @xmath166 lattice sites with no - double - occupancy would give rise to an entropy @xmath167 @xmath168 which then leads to the heikes formula @xcite @xmath169 by noting @xmath170 in eq.([se ] ) and using the sterlings approximation at @xmath171 with @xmath172 .",
    "but since each doped hole is actually a dipolar composite composed of a meron and an antimeron located at two poles , which do not coincide with each other as wall as with other hole dipoles , the total entropy should be reduced by this fact .",

    "3 , the doping concentrations in the data for bi@xmath179 @xcite were indirectly determined by the method involving the hall effect which may be not as reliable as the hole density obtained in lsco and lbco compounds .    note that some modified heikes formulae have been used @xcite phenomenologically to fit the magnitude and doping - dependence of the experimental data in the same low doping regime .",
    "however , it has long been a puzzling question why the hole bandwidth should be shrunk to an order of magnitude smaller than the temperature scale @xmath185 k in order to explain the experiment .",
    "the self - localization of doped holes in the present theory , on the other hand , naturally explains this .",
    "an another important experimental fact is that @xmath159 has been generally found @xcite to decrease continuously to zero as @xmath4 is reduced below @xmath186 k .",
    "such a phenomenon can be easily understood in our theory as follows .",
    "since the holes are self - trapped in space , any impurities , no matter how weak , can easily _ pin down _ them in space at sufficiently low temperatures , truly breaking the translational invariance , and therefore causing the diminishing of the degeneracy ( and thus the entropy ) .",

    "the strong coulomb interaction makes it a doped mott insulator , in which the doped holes interact _ strongly _ with the spin background . as the result",
    ", they can be self - trapped at low doping even without any disorder as described before .",
    "so the self - localization of the doped holes in the lightly doped mott insulator will provide an intrinsic mechanism to explain the localization phenomenon generally observed in the cuprates .",
    "disorder or impurities , on the other hand , should only play a minor role in such a system . as noted above , in the presence of disorder , the spontaneous translational symmetry breaking of the lightly doped mott insulator ( with a lot of degeneracies )",
    "can easily become truly translational breaking , as the self - localized holes , without the penalty from the kinetic energy , are energetically in favor of staying near the impurities .",

    "_ the impurity effect will get `` amplified '' by the mott physics at low doping .",
    "_    recall that a holon has its own bare hopping term , governed by @xmath192  in eq.([hh ] ) , which in the continuum limit reduces to @xmath193 with an effective mass @xmath194  and @xmath195  as the continuum version of the gauge field @xmath28 .",

    "once the holons are unbound from their antimeron partners and move freely at @xmath214 , their transport will be solely governed by the hopping term of the phase - string model ( [ hhc ] ) . here the interaction between holons and antimerons becomes irrelevant as @xmath215 in the above rg analysis .",
    "instead we must consider the contribution from the gauge fluctuations of @xmath195 in eq.([hhc])@xmath174 which will play an essential role for scattering at high temperatures .",
    "note that @xmath195 satisfies the following condition : @xmath216 we can estimate the strength of the fluctuations of @xmath195  by defining @xmath217 where @xmath218  denotes the flux per plaquette : @xmath219 according to eq.([fluxs ] ) . at very high - temperature limit",
    ", one may neglect the nn spin - spin correlations such that @xmath220 which implies very strong flux fluctuations per plaquette in the high-@xmath4 limit .    as a matter of fact , if the fluctuations of @xmath195 is treated in the quasistatic limit with an annealed average over static flux distributions in eq.([hhc ] ) , the transport properties are the same as those studied in ref . @xcite .",
    "in particular , the scattering rate has been found @xcite @xmath221 if @xmath222 , which is satisfied in our case according to eq.([f ] ) in the high-@xmath4 limit .",
    "corresponding , the resistivity is @xmath223 namely , the charge transport in high-@xmath4 `` deconfining phase '' will generally follow a strange - metal behavior due to the scattering between the holons and gauge field @xmath195 in eq.([hhc ] ) .    in the crossover from the low-@xmath4 vrh behavior ( [ sigma ] ) to the high-@xmath4 linear temperature behavior ( [ rho ] ) ,",
    "one expects to see a minimal resistivity @xmath224 .",
    "we point out that generally the `` deconfining temperature '' @xmath213 does not necessarily coincide with the characteristic temperature of @xmath224 .",
    "the latter may occur at a lower temperature as the fluctuations in @xmath195 can already become important when the nel temperature @xmath225 is approached from below . in the above discussion of the vrh resistivity ,",
    "such a scattering effect has been neglected at low-@xmath4 , which should lead to the enhancement of the resistivity once it becomes important .",
    "another possibility is that the holon induced antimerons may start to move with the increase of temperature , resembling the `` flux - flow '' in a superconducting phase , which also may lead to a qualitative change of the resistivity .",
    "these possibilities in the intermediate temperature regime are beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "another interesting prediction of the self - localization of doped holes is the existence of a _",
    "large _ and _ doping - dependent dielectric constant _ as each hole is a dipolar object of a bound state of a holon and a localized antimeron .",
    "one thus expects that the dielectric constant increases linearly with doping initially and finally diverges as the deconfining point is approached with increasing doping concentration .     as a function of doping calculated at different temperatures .",
    "@xmath226 at half - filling , and the dashed lines indicate the linear dependence of the doping concentration . in the main panel ,",
    "@xmath227 diverges at @xmath228 and in the inset @xmath229 . ]",
    "the dielectric constant defined in the rg analysis in sec .",
    "ii c can be written by @xmath230 we can determine @xmath231 by eq .",
    "( [ rc3 ] ) numerically ( taking @xmath123 ) .",
    "4 and the inset show the results for @xmath232 at @xmath233 and @xmath234 respectively . at half - filling , @xmath226 as no contribution from the hole - dipoles .",
    "we see that with the increase of the hole concentration , the dielectric constant grows linearly with @xmath108 at first , then deviates the linearity shown by the dashed line , indicating the increase of the dipole size .",
    "eventually it diverges at a critical doping concentration @xmath235 beyond which the dipoles will collapse and free holons will be released .    the general trend of the calculated in - plane dielectric constant , shown in fig .",
    "4 , qualitatively agrees @xcite with the experimental measurements @xcite in the low - doping cuprates .",
    "indeed , for the lightly - doped cuprates , a large , doping - dependent dielectric constant has been observed in the @xmath236-plane , which increases with the hole concentration @xmath108 , initially linearly then becoming divergent at some higher concentrations @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the out - plane ( c - axis ) dielectric constant shows no essential change as a function of @xmath108 .    in a doped - semiconductor picture",
    ", a dielectric constant contributed by the doped holes can only be significant when the holes are bound to impurities , which is in the localized regime at low temperatures .",
    "but such a dielectric constant should be usually anisotropic 3d - like rather than pure 2d - like as the experiment revealed . especially it is difficult to explain why the dielectric constant should diverge in the @xmath236-plane while remains constant in the c - axis .",
    "furthermore , if the majority of the holes remains bound to impurities , it is hard to reconcile with the large _  saturated _ thermopower observed at @xmath237 k.    in contrast , the dipolar structure of the doped holes in the present framework can naturally lead to a _",
    "large _ dielectric constant _ in the _ @xmath238_-plane _ , no matter whether the hole - dipoles are pinned down by impurities or not , as long as the hole dipole composites remain stable .",
    "the hole dipoles are presumably de - pinned from impurities at @xmath239 k in our theory , since a large thermopower has been seen in experiment . with further increasing temperature",
    ", the dipolar structure will eventually collapse and the holon will become _ deconfined _ from its antimeron partner .",
    "consequently the large dielectric constant and thermopower should be both quickly reduced above @xmath240 where the resistivity also starts to behave like a strange - metal as @xmath4 becomes sufficiently high .",
    "in this paper , we studied the motion of doped holes in a spin ordered background at low doping . based on the phase - string model",
    ", we demonstrated that the holes will get self - localized in space , leading to a spontaneous translational symmetry breaking without the presence of disorder or impurities .",
    "this novel property is an important consequence of the mott insulator at low doping , described by the phase - string model as the low - energy effective description of the @xmath7 hamiltonian .",
    "the doping effect and the interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom are characterized by a unique gauge structure with a mutual duality . at low doping ,",
    "the spinon condensation forces a `` confinement '' on the holons , making the latter self - localized and resulting an insulator with an aflro or spin glass .",
    "this is in contrast to the higher - doping phase , where the holon condensation forces a `` confinement '' on the spinon part , resulting in a superconducting phase coherence @xcite .",
    "we found strong experimental implications based on the self - localization of holes .",
    "large and doping - dependent thermopower can naturally explain the experimental data which had been very hard to understand by conventional theories .",
    "a large and doping - dependent in - plane dielectric constant indicates a composite structure of the holes and provides a unique explanation of the experimental observations , which otherwise are very difficult to comprehend .",
    "furthermore , the low-@xmath4 vrh resistivity observed experimentally was interpreted as the direct consequence of the self - localization with disorders playing a minor role , which explains why the critical doping of the delocalization in the cuprates is universally around @xmath241 at @xmath101 not very sensitive to the density of disorders in the samples .",
    "the phase - string model also naturally shows how the resistivity evolves into a strange - metallic linear-@xmath4 behavior at sufficiently high temperatures above the delocalization temperature .",
    "most importantly , we wish to emphasize that all these peculiar experimental properties were shown to be consistently explained within a single theoretical framework .",
    "it should be noted that many results in this paper are only correct for a homogeneous phase .",
    "there may exist another possibility , namely , the stripe instability @xcite in the phase string model , which can result in an inhomogeneous phase .",
    "since holes are self - localized , their kinetic energies are suppressed such that the potential energy will become predominant .",
    "the dipole - dipole interaction might cause stripe instability at low temperatures , with hole - dipoles collapsing into a one - dimensional line - up ( stripe ) @xcite .",
    "the pinning effect of disorders may stabile the homogeneous phase at low-@xmath242 so does the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "but it would be very interesting to incorporate the inhomogeneous tendency in various dynamic properties at low doping in future investigations .",
