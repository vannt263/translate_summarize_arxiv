    "the origin of the `` fundamental plane '' relation ( hereon fp ) of elliptical galaxies is still unknown , despite of all the efforts to understand it since it was discovered ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "on fundamental grounds , the simplest version of the virial theorem applied to galaxies predicts that they should form a family of objects following a simple projected relation , involving structural and kinematical variables , for instance : @xmath1 . in this equation , @xmath2 is a structural - kinematical parameter , @xmath3 is the central projected velocity dispersion , @xmath4 , the average surface brightness within the effective radius in linear units , and @xmath5 is the effective radius .",
    "the coefficient @xmath2 relates physical ( 3-d ) to projected variables , like the velocity dispersion and mass distributions .",
    "hence , @xmath6 depends on kinematical ( @xmath7 ) and structural ( @xmath8 ) coefficients , as well as on the mass - luminosity ratio ( @xmath9 ) of the systems ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , hereon cdcc95 ; @xcite , hereon dcdcr01 ) .",
    "we define a family of _ homologous _ galaxies as virialized systems where the kinematical and structural coefficients are simply constant for all galaxies , or may change but in a constant ratio throughout the family .",
    "if furthermore @xmath9 is constant for all galaxies ( or equivalently , @xmath10 and @xmath11 may change among them but in a constant ratio ) , then @xmath2 is a constant for a given homologous family .",
    "the expression of the fp is similar to that expected from the projected virial relation but with significantly different exponents and small scatter throughout : @xmath12 ( where the exponents are : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in the case of ellipticals , it is inferred that @xmath2 must vary monotonically among these galaxies if one is willing to retrieve the virial relation for these systems .",
    "there are several reasonable alternatives to explain why and how @xmath2 should vary in order to explain the discrepancy between the virial theorem and the fp .",
    "one of them assumes a systematic variation of @xmath9 with the total mass of the system , preserving homology .",
    "this would be responsible for the whole @xmath2 variation ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this dependence would be caused by systematic stellar population ( e.g. mean stellar age , metallicity , etc . )",
    "variations with mass . @xcite",
    "have shown that there is a dependence of the fp tilt with wavelength , namely @xmath15 where @xmath16 varies with the photometric band ( @xmath17 ) in which the luminosity is measured .",
    "this means that @xmath16 decreases from the @xmath18 to the @xmath19 band , although never reaching the homologous , virial expectations . as discussed by pahre & djorgovski ,",
    "the trend of @xmath16 with @xmath17 can not be explained solely by either stellar population models or non - homology ( see their figure 2 ) .",
    "they conclude that a more complete scenario to explain the fp tilt has to invoke contributions from both effects .",
    "broken homology can be achieved both in dissipationless hierarchical merging scenarios ( e.g. , cdcc95 ) and in dissipative mergers of star - forming and gas - rich spirals , where the roles of star formation histories are emphasized ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . a third line of reasoning for explaining the fp assumes that a more refined formulation to describe the equilibrium condition of the luminous component of the elliptical galaxies is adopting a `` two - component virial theorem '' , which assumes of course that ellipticals are dynamically dominated by a dark halo ( @xcite ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we study the origin of the fp tilt under the assumption that elliptical galaxies are more closely described as non - homologous virialized systems , with @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 varying monotonically ( e.g. , cdcc95 , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in a hierarchical galaxy formation scenario , galaxies are built - up by sucessive merge of larger and larger systems .",
    "recent observations have reinforced the idea of hierarchical merger as a reasonable mechanism to form elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , although dissipation seems to be an important ingredient . in any case , numerical investigations of merging seem to be fundamental in understanding the scaling relations of these objects .",
    "the numerical work of cdcc95 has shown , for instance , that the fp correlations can arise naturally from objects that are formed by dissipationless hierarchical mergers of galaxies .",
    "the end products of their simulations result in a non - homologous family of objects , being the peculiar non - homology mainly determined by the parameter @xmath7 varying systematically with the initial orbital energy of the galactic pairs . in a subsequent investigation ,",
    "dcdcr01 have shown that one - component , equal mass collapses of several different initial models and collapse factors produce nearly homologous families of objects .",
    "this result led dcdcr01 to suggest that the driving mechanism producing non - homology would be that of merging _ per se_.",
    "we extend the previous dissipationless numerical investigations in several aspects .",
    "first , the equilibrium models considered by cdcc95 ( king spheres ) do not take into consideration a central density peak .",
    "recent studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) have demonstrated , however , that the presence of a central peak ( or even the presence of a central black hole ) should be much more common in elliptical galaxies than previously thought .",
    "here we consider the hierarchical merge of hernquist models , which present a central density `` cusp '' .",
    "second , cdcc95 only consider one component models .",
    "however , it is important to understand the effect of the halo in the dynamics of merging and the consequences of its influence in the equilibrium conditions of the whole system ( @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we consider the merge of two - component hernquist models up to two generations .",
    "one point not addressed by dcdcr01 was the initial difference in spin parameters between proto - galaxies and how that can introduce non - homology into the structural properties of the final objects . in order to address this point",
    ", we investigate how the spin parameter influences the fp of the collapsed objects .",
    "however , the issue which we leave for future work is the study of two - component collapses .",
    "this is an important problem , since in the currently accepted cosmological scenarios , the luminous component collapses in the dark matter halo already virialized some time after the epoch of equality of matter and radiation energy densities .",
    "our present goal is to establish the behaviour of only one - component collapses before analysing two - component ones , which can be studied under a more general approach as , for instance , drawing the models from high resolution cosmological simulations .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way : in section 2 , we present the simulation setups and initial condition grids ; in section 3 , the end products of the simulations are considered in the context of the fp space and the resulting relaxation histories . finally , in section 4 , we discuss our main results .",
    "the simulations were run using two c translations ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) of the treecode ( @xcite ) : a non - parallel version , which was used to run less cpu time consuming , one - component model simulations ; and a parallel version , run for two - component model simulations .",
    "the computational plataforms used were : ( i ) for the non - parallel code : workstations sun - sparc ; sun - ultras ( 1 , 2 , 5 , 10 , and 30 ) ; and sun e250 ; ( ii ) for the parallel code : silicon graphics origin 2000 with four processors using mpi ( `` message passing interface '' ) , irix operational system ; and a `` cluster '' formed by four pentium iii , 650 mhz , working in parallel using lam ( `` local area multicomputer '' ) 6.3.2/mpi 2 c++ , linux .",
    "quadrupole correction terms , according to @xcite , were used in the force calculations for all simulations . in table [ params ] we list the main parameters of the simulations setup adopted in this work .",
    "these parameters were carefully chosen in order to conform to the constraints of resolution and collisionlessness given the total number of particles used in each type of simulation ( more details for the choice of parameters can be found in cdcc95 and dcdcr01 ) . in particular , the choice of the number of particles was also based on the operational constraints due to cpu times . merging generaly involves cpu time - consuming runs for it includes the evolution since the initial orbital phase , before the effective merge of the systems .",
    "this forced us to use a relatively small number of particles to cover a wider grid of initial conditions .",
    "these numbers , however , are well above the lower bound discussed in dcdcr01 .",
    ".initial parameters of the codes [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "we follow the method given by cdcc95 to compute the characteristic fp variables ( @xmath5 , @xmath20 and @xmath3 ) of the simulated models .",
    "the variables @xmath3 and @xmath21 were combined in the vertical axis according to the usual representation of the fp projected onto the cartesian plane @xmath22 . in all the cases",
    "the 3-variate best - fit solutions for a plane gave @xmath23 to within 10% , so we decided to keep this coefficient fixed at 0.2 in order to find the orthogonal least squares solutions for the other coefficients , viz .",
    "the slope @xmath24 ( the fp ` tilt ' ) , and the intercept of the fitted plane .    before analysing the final simulated models in the fp space , however , it is worth to comment that they reproduce the general structural characteristics of elliptical galaxies , e.g. projected triaxialities ( from e0 to e5 elliptical objects ) and surface density profiles ( following the sersic law ) . a detailed discussion on the structural properties of the simulated models is given in @xcite .",
    "in fig . [ fp - lum ]",
    "we present the characteristic fp parameters of the objects resulting from the merging of one ( d , e e f mergers ) and two ( z mergers ) component models . in the case of two - component models ,",
    "the data shown in this figure are relative to the luminous component .",
    "the best fit values of the fp slope ( @xmath24 ) found for these simulations are indicated in the figures .",
    "the continuous line ( @xmath25 ) represent the prediction of the virial theorem for homologous , constant @xmath9 , systems . in table",
    "[ tab_ajus_fus ] , we present the results of the best fit values of the data here discussed as well as the results obtained by cdcc95 and dcrdc01 .",
    "the results indicate that one - component hernquist mergers ( d , e , f ) also reproduce reasonably the fp tilt of the elliptical galaxies , consistent with the results obtained with the king models of cdcc95 .",
    "that is , for both cases , the fp slopes are consistent , within the errors , to that observed for infrared fp of nearby galaxies , that is , @xmath26 ( @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the luminous / barionic objects resulting from the the two - component mergers form a family with a steeper relation in comparison to one - component mergers .",
    "( it is interesting to note that if we consider an equivalent to the fp space but for the dark halos of these merger remnants , we find that they constitute an approximate homologous family of objects , as indicates the value @xmath27 , in table [ tab_ajus_fus ] . ) in order to test the effects of a more compact halo on these results , we ran two groups of two - component hernquist mergers with different ratios for the halo to luminous radius ( as discussed in section 2.2.2 ) . unlike the z models",
    ", these runs were not followed for subsequent ( viz .",
    ", second , etc ) generations because of cpu time limitations . in fig .",
    "[ fp - zbc ] , we show how these more compact halo mergers distribute in the fp space .",
    "the arrows over the dotted lines in that figure represent the range occupied by the first generation z models ( @xmath28 ) , for comparison .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the luminous component of the most compact halo models ( zb models ) , with most negative @xmath29 s , tend to cluster in the fp space in a similar manner as the k collapses .",
    "all other models tend to spread out sensibly along a fp - like relation . also , the luminous body of these models ( zb and zc models ) tend to settle into systematically lower values of @xmath5 and at higher values of @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) than the z models ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the fp ` tilts ' of these models suggest a marginally steeper ` tilt ' than the z models .",
    "as already mentioned , we have performed two groups ( as1 and as3 models ) of collapse simulations with initial spin in order to verify the effects of the inclusion of rotation on the results by dcdcr01 , where evidences for homology were found for pure collapses .",
    "the resulting fp ` tilts ' for both groups ( @xmath32 ; @xmath33 ) suggests that the resulting models are slightly non - homologous , but in the _ opposite _ ( viz .",
    "@xmath34 ) sense from the observed fp ` tilt ' of elliptical galaxies ( c.f .",
    "[ fp - spin ] ) .",
    "all these new collapse models evolved for more than @xmath35 gyr ( @xmath36 ) , however , the `` hottest '' models ( viz . , as1 - 09 and as3 - 09 , both with initial @xmath37 ) still presented a virial ratio oscillating around @xmath38 by that time .",
    "these `` hottest '' models seem to evolve very slowly and still did not reach complete virial equilibrium after @xmath35 gyr , whereas all the other models were already well virialized . removing these `` hottest '' collapse models results in @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which are compatible with homology .",
    "although we cover a reasonable range of @xmath16 s , it is not clear whether the inclusion of more intermediate @xmath16 collapses would necessarily improve the statistics ( i.e. , decrease the error bar of the fit ) , since the `` coldest '' models tend to cluster in the fp space . on the other hand",
    ", the inclusion of `` hotter '' collapses would only exacerbate the observed `` inverted '' ( viz .",
    "@xmath34 ) non - homology .",

    "second , intermediate @xmath62 s ( @xmath63 ) produce objects with spins compatible with boxy ellipticals .",

    "it can be seen that mergers from a wide range of @xmath29 s are able to produce objects in the observed range of ellipticals , as opposed to collapses , which fail in this respect .",
    "it is interesting to notice that `` colder '' collapses reach a higher degree of final spin than the `` hottest '' ones .",
    "this seem to imply that the initial rotational pertubations are amplified in the `` coldest '' collapses . yet , as we have seen , these `` colder '' objects still manage to become approximately homologous ( see fits for @xmath66 and @xmath67 sequences in table [ tab_ajus_fus ] ) .",
    "evidently , these results must be interpreted with caution , since we did not reconfigure the initial structure of the progenitor in order to include higher initial spins .",
    "we use another diagnostics for testing homology on the final simulated objects . a good quantitative measure in this case",
    "is the direct computation of the kinematical - structural or virial coefficients ( @xmath68 ) , as described in cdcc95 and dcdcr01 : @xmath69 and @xmath70 where @xmath5 is the effective radius ( the radius that defines a sphere containing half of the total luminosity of the system ) : @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath75 is the mean surface brightness within @xmath5 , in linear units .",
    "then , @xmath76 , with @xmath77 . inserting the equations above into the virial relation ( @xmath78 ) , we find that @xmath79 , where : @xmath80    since , by construction , @xmath81 ( viz .",
    "@xmath9 ) is constant among the models , the computation of @xmath8 and @xmath7 directly gives the measure of non - homology among the simulated models .",
    "note that for two - component systems , @xmath72 and @xmath82 are calculated from , respectively , the total potential and kinetic energy of the system .",
    "values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 correspond , however , only to the visible / barionic matter . as already pointed out , non - homologous objects are those which the kinematical - structural coefficients assume different values for each object .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ homol ] , where we plot the coefficients as a function of the initial conditions .",
    "first , we find that the structural coefficients , @xmath8 , attain different ranges of values for one and two - component models : for one - component mergers , @xmath83 ; whereas for two - component mergers , @xmath84 .",
    "this difference is due to the presence of the massive halo in the two - component models , which pushes the gravitational radius to larger values , as compared to the one - component systems .",
    "this increase of @xmath72 can not , however , be compensated by @xmath5 , which depends only on the structure of the luminous core .",
    "the kinematical coefficients , @xmath7 , on the other hand , show similar ranges for both types of mergers .",
    "the product @xmath85 ( c.f .",

    "[ homol ] ) therefore attain larger values for two - component models than for one - component ones .    a more relevant aspect of fig . [ homol ]",
    "is the fact that the kinematical / structural coefficients vary in a systematic manner as a function of the initial orbital energy of the merging models , which is in agreement with the results found by cdcc95 .",
    "this behaviour seem to be an important feature distinguishing mergers from collapses . indeed , collapses as a whole",
    "are approximately homologous objects , although some distinctions between `` cold '' and `` hot '' collapses are found ( detailed discussion for collapses can be found in dcdcr01 ) .",
    "there seems to be no correlation with the orbital angular momentum , as can be seen from an inspection of fig .",
    "[ homol ] . on the other hand",
    ", it can be seen that the deviation from homology is more accentuated for two - component mergers : if we take the total fractional difference of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , we find @xmath88 for two - component mergers whereas @xmath89 for one - component models ( @xmath90 is @xmath91 for homologous objects ) .",
    "this quantity therefore reproduces the deviation from homology as pictured in the fp space ( c.f .",
    "[ fp - lum ] ) , with the advantage that it is possible to trace the source of non - homology from the corresponding fractional differences of the @xmath8 and the @xmath7 coefficients separately . for one - component mergers , @xmath92 , @xmath93 ; for two - component mergers , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , for one - component mergers , @xmath7 contributes more to the non - homology than @xmath8 , a feature that can be seen clearly from an inspection of fig .",
    "[ homol ] .",
    "the results of the previous section demonstrate that the ( central ) non - homology effect which characterizes our merger simulations has a predominant kinematical origin .",
    "now we will analyse the behavior of the total kinetic energy _",
    "interior _ to a given radius as compared to the corresponding kinetic energies _ exterior _ to that radius .",
    "in other words , if we call @xmath96 the `` central '' kinetic energy of the the system and @xmath97 the kinetic energy of its `` envelope '' , then a measure the ratio of these quantities,@xmath98 , _ normalized to its progenitor value _ , should reveal , at least in a gross sense , the effects of the process of relaxation .",
    "this process will therefore be viewed as alterations of the kinetic energies of the more gravitationally bounded ( `` central '' ) particles against the less bounded ones ( `` envelope '' ) . thus if @xmath99 then the end product model presents the stratification of kinetic energies similar to the progenitor model . if however @xmath100 then the `` central '' particles are `` hotter '' than the `` envelope '' , _ as compared to the progenitor_.    we analysed the kinetic energy ratio , @xmath101 , as a function of the initial conditions ( collapse factor or orbital energies , for the mergers ) , for three different radii ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) .",

    "the general trend is that the collapse models are centrally `` hotter '' than the corresponding progenitor , _ independently of the initial @xmath16 _ ( except for @xmath16 s very close to @xmath104 ) and the initial model used .",
    "the stratification of kinetic energies in the case of mergers is not similar to the collapses . for mergers ,",
    "it is clear that _",
    "@xmath101 is a systematic function of the initial orbital energy of the pairs_. in other words , for mergers with more negative initial orbital energies @xmath107 , showing no difference with their progenitors , whereas the ones with less negative energies deviate more from the progenitor , _ and in a systematic way _ , towards @xmath100 .",
    "the magnitude of the deviation from @xmath99 also depends on the merging models : for instance , is greater for the king models , intermediate for the hernquist one - component models , and smaller for the hernquist two - component models .",
    "it also seems to slightly increase for increasingly merger generations .",
    "there are also examples where @xmath108 ( some hernquist two - component models , with @xmath109 ) . in other words ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath101 for mergers seems to be more complex than collapses and shows a clear systematic dependency on the initial orbital energy of the pairs , in the same sense that the virial coefficients depend systematically on @xmath29 .    in case of mergers ,",
    "the systematic dependency of @xmath101 on @xmath29 begins to flatten and tend to be erased for sufficiently large values of @xmath105 .",
    "this in fact shows that the merger models tend to a similar stratification of the `` central '' and `` envelope '' kinetic energies at sufficiently large radius . in other words ,",
    "the different @xmath101 values among the merger models are not only a function of the initial orbital energy but is a function of @xmath105 as well , so that the correlation @xmath110 is stronger at the very center of the models and tend to disappear at sufficiently large radii .",
    "this shows therefore that the effect is intimately related to the central parts of the system .",
    "our detailed description of the ratio of kinetic energies behaviour among models , as given in this section , seem to reinforce the idea that the non - homolgy in mergers is a central effect ruled by how the particles gain kinetic energy during the merger .",
    "in other words , the non - homology seem to have a dynamical origin which is not present in simple collapses .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the analysis of the relaxation history of both mergers and colapses , which may help us to find clues for understanding the dynamical processes that are at the origin of the non - homology of mergers .        in order to trace a measure of the fluctuations of the gravitational potential on its way to equilibrium , we compared the behaviour of the virial ratio @xmath111 ( measured for the whole system , including escapers ) during the evolution of different and representative types of models , namely : a `` cold '' ( a01 model , @xmath112 ) and a `` hot '' ( a09 model , @xmath113 ) collapse ; against a `` rapid '' ( d10 model , @xmath114 , @xmath65 ) and a `` slow '' ( d9 model , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) one - component merger .",

    "this is due to the fact that we are measuring the virial coefficient using the complete particle data , including particles with positive energies which have escaped the system .",
    "more `` violent '' relaxations produce more escapers , and the resulting virial ratio stabilizes around some other value slightly different than @xmath118 .",
    "we notice that the most rapidly merging system suffer only one major fluctuation of @xmath111 , subsequently rapidly reaching equilibrium .",
    "the slower merger shows that @xmath111 varies in large periods during the first moments of the evolution ( in other words : it does not show a unique abrupt change in @xmath111 , but rather two or more large periodic fluctuations before reaching equilibrium ) .",
    "collapses , regardless of being `` cold '' or `` hot '' show one large initial fluctuation amplitude in @xmath111 .",
    "interestingly , subsequent evolution seem to be different : the `` cold '' collapse still experiences one more relatively significant fluctuation of @xmath111 before reaching equilibrium .",
    "the `` hot '' collapse , on the other hand , show a persistent , although of low amplitude , fluctuation of @xmath111 still for some time , when the `` colder '' collapse is comparatively well stabilized .      in order to understand the dynamical behaviour presented by the simulated models",
    ", we apply a diagnostic advocated by @xcite .",
    "the merging of stellar systems occurs because of a transfer of the orbital energy to the particles of the stellar systems in question .",
    "the mechanisms through which this occurs are the tidal interactions , which increase the internal energy of the systems at the expense of their orbital energy .",
    "the question here concerns the relation of this mechanism with the central non - homology of the simulated mergers .    during the evolution of the system ,",
    "the energy of the particles is not , in general , conserved , even in a `` coarse grained '' sense ( viz . through the distribution @xmath119 ; for a discussion on the importance of this distribution for stellar systems , see @xcite ) .",

    "studied the distribution of the energy of the particles in systems resulting from collisions ( without the formation of a final single object ) and merging of two galaxies .",

    "the method may be considered a `` lagrangian '' approach to the analysis of how the energy of the particles change because of the relaxation process .",
    "the particles of the _ initial _ models have been sorted accordingly to their binding energies and the models were partitioned into 5 bins of equal number of particles ( a finer partitioning with 10 bins produced essentially the same results ) . for each of these bins , the mean energy was calculated and the bins ranked with the first one initially containing the most bound particles ( most negative mean energy ) whereas the fifth , the less bounded ones ( less negative mean energy ) .",

    "these results confirm the findings of kandrup et al .",
    "moreover the mean energies per bin that changed more in this case were the ones corresponding to the most bounded bins ( 1 , 2 , 3 , etc ) .",
    "the central potential becomes deeper after the collapse , and the particles initially more bounded to the system tend to loose energy , becoming even more tied .",
    "this effect is also a function of the collapse factor @xmath16 , as can be seen by the dashed line in the figure , which connects the most bounded bin ( 1 ) , illustrating how this bin changes as a function initial condition . in the case of a collapses ,",
    "the mean energies representing the three less bounded bins converge to similar final values , whereas the two most strongly bounded bins reach even more negative mean values .",
    "this behaviour indicate that collapses tend to produce core - halo structures . in the case of c collapses , the mean energies change considerably and chaotically .",
    "recall that these models contain a hubble flux which may favor the grow of perturbations embedded in these models , adding some complexity in the evolution of the mean energy of these distinct collections of particles .    in the case of mergers ( one and two - component models ) , the preservation of the ordering of the mean energies per bin is not as good as in the case of collapses .",
    "for the d models ( hernquist one - component models ) , the initially most bounded particles will remain as the most bounded ones after the relaxation process .",
    "however , it can be seen that the bins number 3 actually cross bins number 2 and reach the values corresponding to bins number 1 . in the case of two - component models , the luminous matter tend to reach very negative values of the mean energies , almost converging to similar values for all bins .",
    "the general behaviour of the luminous component resemble the behaviour of the most boundly tied particles of the collapse models .",
    "the main reason for this may be the fact that , after the initial interaction , the luminous component finds its equilibrium state within the deeper potential well of the dark halo .",
    "this might occur through a partial collapse of the luminous matter inside the dark halo . in the case of the dark matter component",
    ", there is also some violation of the ordering of the mean energies per bin .",
    "in fact , the initially most boundly tied bins ( number 1 ) crosses upwards and gain energy in some cases .",
    "the halo seems to be the only system that actually shows clearly this behaviour .",
    "the d models and the luminous component also present the same effect as seen in collapses : the particles initially more bounded to the system tend to loose energy as a function of the initial orbital energy , as can be seen by the dashed line in the figure , which connects the most bounded bins ( 1 ) . for halos ,",
    "this behaviour is not as clear .",
    "note that the mean biding energy of the most bounded bins remains at an almost constant value for collapses ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fa4.5.col ] ) , rising steeply for the `` hottest '' collapses .",
    "the c models present more fluctuations in this behaviour . for mergers , on the other hand , these changes proceed more smoothly and systematically with the initial orbital energy ( dashed lines in fig . [ fa4.5.mer ] ) .",
    "this means that the initially most bounded collection of particles remain at the average the most bounded particles after the relaxation , but at a more negative mean energy than the slower ( less negative @xmath29 ) mergers .",
    "it is clear that if the ordering of the mean energies of particles , partitioned at a coarse - grained level , is strictly conserved , as in collapses , then the most bounded particles ( in average closer to the baricenter ) continue be the most bounded particles after virialization .",
    "however , as pointed out previously , this ordering conservation _ does not _ occur for mergers .",
    "in other words , some complex behaviour seem to take place during the merger involving the more central or bounded particles , an effect which _ does not _ occur at all in collapses ( except for some small shuffling between the _ less _ bounded bins for the `` hottest '' c models ) . in summary",
    ", we entirely confirm the results of kandrup et al . for collapses , but in the case of mergers , some violation of the ordering conservation of the energy bins is present .",
    "we have simulated a hierarchical non - dissipative merger scheme similar to that of cdcc95 , however using different models for representing the progenitors of the @xmath120 generation mergers .",
    "in contrast with cdcc95 , which considered king density profiles , we used models endowed with cuspy profiles , such as the hernquist density profile . also models with a dark halo second component",
    "were used in this study . a comparison with collapse simulations ( previously analysed in dcdcr01 and here extended to include collapses with initial spins )",
    "is presented .",
    "we found that the one - component hernquist mergers give results similar to those found by cdcc95 for the one - component king models , namely both were able to build - up small scattering fp - like correlations with slopes consistent to those found for the near infrared fp of nearby galaxies .",
    "the two - component models also reproduce a fp - like correlation , but with a significantly steeper slope which is in agreement with that found for galaxies at high redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "pahre finds that the slope of the near - infrared fp decreases with increasing redshift ( see his figure 7.2 ) . another important piece of evidence of the evolution of the fp with redshift comes from the work of @xcite .",
    "the authors find that the structure of the galaxies in the analysed sample has not changed significantly since @xmath121 , based on the fact that the observed scatter is rather low : @xmath122 in @xmath123 .",
    "besides , they find a dependence between @xmath124 and redshift , which reinforces the idea of a stellar population effect in the evolution of the fp .    in nature , dissipational effects must have played a role in producing the fp relations and their scatter , but it would be unwise to completely disregard the role of stellar dynamics in shaping ellipticals as well .",
    "our simulations are only of a dynamical character , with the @xmath9 ratio fixed by construction .",
    "systematic non - homology in the evolved models can produce fp - like ` tilts ' compatible with those found in nature .",
    "in particular , we show the importance of the gravitational potential of the halo for changing the ` tilt ' of the fp : the magnitude of the change can be seen directly from a comparison between one - component and two - component hernquist merger models ( c.f .",
    "1 ) . in other words ,",
    "this simple result clearly shows how the fp slope may be dynamically changed just by the addition of a halo .",
    "therefore , our results suggest that the structure evolution of the halo could also have a collateral importance in changing and shaping the fp ` tilt ' , along with population evolution effects ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we speculate on the possibility that halos may suffer evolution from @xmath125 to the present .",
    "the evolution could be in the form of tidal stripping , which would decrease the mass of the halo , or by the presence of supermassive central black holes , which could alter the matter distribution of the halo , forming a core ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . if dark matter presents some level of self - interaction ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , then it may drive evolution towards a core in less than a hubble time ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . if some of these processes have operated in halos during the past few gyrs , in the sense of altering their gravitational potentials at the centers of galaxies , the characteristic scaling properties of the luminous / barionic component might have changed as well",
    ". whether any of these possibilities are in factible is at present an open issue .",
    "a qualitative analysis of the behaviour of the mean energy of collections of particles ( as advocated by kandrup et al . 1993 ) lead us to consider the possibility that ` mesoscopic ' constraints could have some connection to the central non - homology .",
    "the conservation of the ordering of the mean energy of collections of particles implies that the process of ` mixing ' in the one - particle energy space is quite inefficient as compared with ` mixing ' in configuration and/or velocity space ( see discussion in kandrup et al . ) .",
    "this seem to be true for collapses , but not entirely for the central parts of mergers .",
    "the most intense tidal perturbations ( shocks ) seem to be found for the most rapidly merging systems ( more negative orbital energies ) . in this case",
    ", the particles probably withdraw the energy from the relative orbit of the merging pairs at one major fluctuation .",
    "secondary fluctuations on the gravitational potential evolve afterwards rapidly and reach equilibrium in a short timescale as well .",
    "the stratification of the kinetic energies resemble that of the progenitor in this case . on the other hand ,",
    "if the orbital energy is less negative ( slow mergers ) , there is some of time for the particles to withdraw energy from the orbit of the pair , and this process involves periodically large fluctuations on the potential that evolve slowly , taking a larger amount of time to stabilize .",
    "this process may be important in `` heating up '' the central parts of the models approaching @xmath126 .",
    "this should be important in defining the non - homology in mergers because the stratification of the kinetic energies are indeed different to that of the progenitor .",
    "on the other hand , in the case of collapses , the dynamics seem to operate in a different manner than in mergers .",
    "collapses starts off from a spherically symmetric condition that mergers do not share .",
    "collapses also produce not only fast by very high amplitude gravitational potential fluctuations that dump rapidly .",
    "this process should be very efficient in heating up the central parts of the models in configuration and/or velocity space , but not efficient enough to have the particles ` forget ' their initial energies in a collective ( ` mesoscopic ' ) manner . as already pointed out by kandrup et al .",
    ", this behaviour is at odds with lynden - bell s theory of ` violent relaxation ' , where ` mixing ' in energy space is not expected to be inefficient for any given collection of particles . at the same time",
    ", we have found that collapses seem to ` prefer ' forming homologous systems , whereas mergers do not .",
    "some connection between ` mesoscopic ' constraints and non - homology seem to be apparent , but this is an open question .",
    "we did not atempt at this time to rigorously try to connect the behaviour of the violation of the ordering of the energy bins ( figs .",
    "[ fa4.5.mer ] and [ fa4.5.col ] ) with the behaviour of the ` central ' to ` envelope ' kinetic energies ( figs .",
    "[ mare.mergers ] and [ mare.col ] ) .",
    "although interesting , in order to fully understand this effect , we would need to probe the problem of relaxation in a much deeper and/or formal manner , which is not the objetive of our paper at the present time . figs .",
    "[ fa4.5.mer ] and [ fa4.5.col ] illustrate a diagnostic on the behaviour of the change of energy of the system due to relaxation in a ` mesoscopic ' scale . figs .",
    "[ mare.mergers ] and [ mare.col ] show a different dignostic , where the change of energy of the central and external parts of the system are compared to their _ progentor models _ , not the to their initial condition ( as in figs .",
    "[ fa4.5.mer ] and [ fa4.5.col ] ) , and hence refer to a more ` macroscopic ' feature of the relaxation process . on the other hand , the main point of figs .",
    "[ fa4.5.mer ] and [ fa4.5.col ] is _ not _ to show how the energy of collections of particles change due to relaxation ( although it also certainly shows that ) but in _ what degree _ the ordering of their mean energies is violated .",
    "this type of analysis was first envisaged by kandrup in 1993 and is still not well understood . in our oppinion , it is not at all clear how one could find any immediate connection between both sets of figures .",
    "we know that the non - homology comes primarily as a systematic function of @xmath29",
    ". both sets of figures show systematic behaviour of 2 different types of diagnostics as a function of @xmath29 .",
    "collapses show almost no dependecy of these same diagnostics with @xmath16 ( except for the `` hottest '' collapses ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that relaxation through merging embodies some mechanism which is effective in differentiating the final models , producing non - homology , whereas this mechanism is absent or highly precluded in collapses ( again , except for the `` hottest '' ones , which are just a small perturbation form equilibrium of the progenitor model ) .",
    "in fact , what is lacking in order to make any progress in this direction is a systematic understanding of the nature of the gravitational relaxation mechanism , where several conceptual issues are still unsolved ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    in any case ,",
    "our results seems to strenghten the idea that dissipationless merging could produce significant non - homology in the final objects and therefore fp - like relations in the same sense and with comparable values of the fp ` tilt ' as those observed in ellipticals .",
    "we have shown that , from purely dynamical grounds , mergers can produce fp - like relations while _ simple _ collapses can not ( two - component collapses were not investigated here and will be a subject for future work ) .",
    "the evolution of gradients in the gravitational field of the merging galaxies seem to dictate the final non - homology of the end products .",
    "further investigations are necessary in order to stablish , quantify and rigorously explain these complex effects , as preliminary discussed in this paper .",
