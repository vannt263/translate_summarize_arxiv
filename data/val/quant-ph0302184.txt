    "in physics , dynamical equations often have a differential form and are solved under various boundary conditions .",
    "this is also the case in quantum mechanics , whose dynamics is encoded by the schrdinger equation . the purpose of this contribution is to discuss , in a somewhat sketchy way , how boundary conditions imposed upon the schrdinger equation determine the physical content of its solutions . and vice versa : in order to obtain the solutions of the schrdinger equation that describe a given physical situation , boundary conditions that fit the physical situation must be imposed upon the schrdinger equation .    in the non - relativistic domain ,",
    "the time - independent schrdinger equation is realized , in the position representation , as a second - order differential equation .",
    "if the potential is simple enough , we can exactly solve the differential equation by means of the sturm - liouville theory  @xcite .",
    "this theory yields an eigenfunction expansion , a unitary operator that diagonalizes the hamiltonian , and a direct integral decomposition . in its turn ,",
    "the direct integral decomposition yields , along with some physical requirements , a rigged hilbert space ( rhs ) .",
    "the eigenfunction expansion , the unitary operator that diagonalizes the hamiltonian , the direct integral decomposition , and the rhs contain much of the spectral and physical informations of the hamiltonian . for convenience",
    ", we shall refer to them as the rhs properties ( abbreviated rsp ) associated to the hamiltonian  @xcite . at first sight",
    ", it may seem that the schrdinger equation corresponding to a given hamiltonian generates just one single rsp .",
    "however , this is not necessarily so .",
    "there are certain types of boundary conditions that , when imposed upon the schrdinger equation , yield different rsps . to be more precise , the standing - wave boundary condition ( to be defined below ) , and the `` in '' and `` out '' boundary conditions of the lippmann - schwinger equation generate three different rsps .",
    "the gamow vectors are the state vectors of resonances  @xcite . like the standing - wave and the lippmann - schwinger eigensolutions",
    ", they solve the schrdinger equation . at infinity , however , the gamow eigenfunctions satisfy the purely outgoing boundary condition .",
    "this condition selects the ( complex ) resonance spectrum of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation is time symmetric , the reason for which it is generally believed that quantum mechanics is time symmetric  @xcite . and yet the time evolution of individual atoms or subatomic particles seems to have some directness .",
    "for example , imagine that we want to compute the probability for a particle to go from an initial space - time location @xmath1 to a final space - time location @xmath2 .",
    "our basic notions of causality dictate that this probability be zero when @xmath3",
    ". however , as far as the schrdinger equation is concerned , this probability is also non - zero when @xmath3 . in order to obtain the causal result",
    ", we have to use the retarded propagator @xmath4 ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "this retarded propagator automatically yields a causal probability , because it vanishes when @xmath3 : @xmath5 therefore , the time evolution given by @xmath4 has an arrow of time : a particle travels forward in time , never backward .",
    "as is well known , the time evolution given by the ( e.g. , retarded ) propagator is equivalent to the time - dependent schrdinger equation subject to an ( e.g. , retarded ) causal boundary condition .",
    "hence , the arrow of time built into @xmath4 stems ultimately from causal boundary conditions .",
    "quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) provides a glaring example of how the propagators carry an arrow of time . in qed ,",
    "the feynman propagator is constructed by imposing feynman s @xmath0 prescription upon the time evolution of particles and antiparticles  @xcite .",
    "particles travel forward in time , whereas antiparticles `` travel backward '' in time .",
    "clearly , this prescription builds an arrow of time into the feynman propagator . but note that this arrow of time is introduced by means of feynman s @xmath0 prescription , which is a boundary condition .",
    "thus , the arrow of time of the feynman propagator also stems ultimately from causal boundary conditions .",
    "0.4 cm    the organization of this contribution is as follows :    0.4 cm    ( _ i _ ) in order to obtain the standing - wave eigensolution @xmath6 , the `` in '' lippmann - schwinger eigensolution @xmath7 , and the `` out '' lippmann - schwinger eigensolution @xmath8 , we shall impose upon the schrdinger equation the standing - wave , the `` in , '' and the `` out '' boundary condition , respectively .",
    "each of the eigensolutions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 yields an rsp of its own .",
    "hence , we shall conclude that each of the eigensolutions @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 has a physical content of its own .    0.4 cm    ( _ ii _ ) it will be apparent that what makes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 different from each other is the boundary conditions that they satisfy .",
    "more precisely , what makes them different from each other is their asymptotic behavior at infinity .",
    "0.4 cm    ( _ iii _ ) we will relate the asymptotic behavior at infinity of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 with their analytical dependence on the energy , and see why applying the sturm - liouville theory to these eigenfunctions yields three different rsps .    0.4 cm    ( _ iv _ ) when two eigenfunctions have just a different normalization , they generate the same rsp . a criterion to check whether or not two eigensolutions lead to different rsps ( i.e. , whether or not two eigensolutions differ from a normalization factor ) is provided .",

    ". we shall refer to this time asymmetry as the qed arrow of time .",
    "we shall see that the qed arrow of time is built into feynman s propagator .",
    "a parallel of the qed arrow of time with that of classical electrodynamics will be made .",
    "we shall conclude that , in general , there exists an arrow of time at the microscopic level , and that this arrow of time arises from the imposition of a time - asymmetric , causal boundary condition upon the ( time - symmetric ) schrdinger equation . because solving the schrdinger equation subject to a time - asymmetric boundary condition necessarily involves the construction of a propagator",
    ", we shall conclude that the quantum - mechanical arrow of time is built into the propagators .",
    "we proceed now to see how boundary conditions affect the behavior of the solutions of the time - independent schrdinger equation . rather than working in a general fashion",
    ", we shall use the spherical shell potential as an illustrative example .",
    "generalizations to more complicated potentials are straightforward .",
    "consider the spherical shell potential of height @xmath9 , @xmath10 if we restrict ourselves to the zero angular momentum case , then the spherical shell hamiltonian acts , in the radial position representation , as the following formal differential operator : @xmath11 the time - independent schrdinger equation ( for zero angular momentum ) reads @xmath12    our objective in this section is to solve ( [ rse0 ] ) subject to various boundary conditions , and to analyze the physical content of both the solutions and the boundary conditions .",
    "we shall study three cases : the standing - wave , the lippmann - schwinger , and the gamow eigensolutions .",
    "we first study the standing - wave eigenfunctions . to obtain them , we solve ( [ rse0 ] ) under the following boundary conditions :    & & ( 0;e)=0 ,",

    "[ bocchiata4 ]    the eigensolution of ( [ rse0 ] ) that satisfies ( [ raogr])([bocchiata4 ] ) is given by the regular solution : @xmath13 where @xmath14 the coefficients @xmath15@xmath16 in ( [ chi ] ) are such that @xmath17 satisfies ( [ bocchiata1 ] ) and ( [ bocchiata4 ] ) .",
    "the expressions of @xmath15@xmath16 can be easily calculated ( they can also be found , for example , in  @xcite ) .    the regular solution @xmath17 is not @xmath18-normalized .",
    "in order to @xmath18-normalize it , we need the spectral measure @xmath19 multiplying @xmath17 by the square root of this spectral measure yields the @xmath18-normalized eigensolution of ( [ rse0 ] ) that satisfies the boundary conditions ( [ raogr])([bocchiata4 ] ) : @xmath20 the @xmath18-normalization of @xmath6 is to be understood in the following sense : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the complex conjugate of @xmath6 .",
    "note that although @xmath6 is also defined for complex energies , we have restricted @xmath23 to @xmath24 , because the ( hilbert space ) spectrum of the hamiltonian ( [ doh ] ) is the positive real line .    at infinity ,",
    "the eigensolution ( [ dnes ] ) is a linear combination of @xmath25 which is an incoming spherical wave of amplitude @xmath26 , and @xmath27 which is an outgoing spherical wave of amplitude @xmath28 .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath23 is real , ( [ inc ] ) is the complex conjugate of ( [ outc ] ) .",

    "the boundary conditions ( [ raogr])([bocchiata4 ] ) are customarily imposed upon the schrdinger equation , one may be tempted to conclude that we have found all the possible rsps of the spherical shell potential . as we shall see , this is not the case : when we multiply @xmath17 by the jost functions , we obtain the `` in '' and `` out '' eigensolutions , which generate two new rsps for the spherical shell potential .",
    "the `` in '' and `` out '' eigensolutions ( and therefore their associated rsps ) are determined by the boundary conditions built into the lippmann - schwinger equation .",

    "@xmath49 therefore , even though @xmath6 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 all fulfill one and the same schrdinger equation and have one and the same radial dependence , they generate three different rsps .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 and @xmath51 differ from each other by just a phase factor [ see ( [ phsfo ] ) ] , because @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "how is then possible that they lead to different rsps ?",
    "the answer to this question is the following : @xmath6 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 lead to different rsps because they satisfy different , physically non - equivalent boundary conditions .    in order to better understand why @xmath6 , @xmath50 ,",
    "@xmath51 yield three different rsps , we compare the lippmann - schwinger boundary conditions ( [ bcols+-1])([bcols6 ] ) to the standing - wave boundary conditions ( [ raogr])([bocchiata4 ] ) .",
    "we can see first that the boundary conditions ( [ bcols+-1])([bcols+-3 ] ) are the same as ( [ raogr])([bocchiata4 ] ) .",
    "we can also see that in the lippmann - schwinger case , we have imposed an additional boundary condition that selects the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions at infinity .",
    "for the `` in '' lippmann - schwinger eigenfunction , we have chosen ( [ bcols5 ] ) , which means that far away from the potential region @xmath54 is a linear combination of an incoming spherical wave and an outgoing spherical wave multiplied by the @xmath39 matrix ( which is a phase factor ) .",
    "for the `` out '' lippmann - schwinger eigenfunction , we have chosen ( [ bcols6 ] ) , which means that far away from the potential region @xmath55 is a linear combination of an outgoing spherical wave and an incoming spherical wave multiplied by the complex conjugate of the @xmath39 matrix ( which is also a phase factor ) . in the standing - wave case , we did not explicitly impose any boundary condition at infinity , which is tantamount to imposing the standing - wave asymptotic behavior .",
    "thus @xmath6 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 differ from each other just by their asymptotic behavior at infinity .",
    "these different asymptotic behaviors lead , by means of the jost functions , to different analytical properties of the eigensolutions as functions of the energy when @xmath23 is allowed to be complex . because the sturm - liouville theory  @xcite always deals with complex energies , eigenfunctions with different analytical properties yield different rsps .",
    "therefore , what ultimately makes @xmath6 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 different is their different analytical behavior when @xmath23 is allowed to be complex .",
    "an important conclusion can be drawn from the previous paragraph : boundary conditions that in the position representation select the asymptotic behavior read , in the energy representation , as boundary conditions that select the analytical behavior , and vice versa .",
    "this is particularly apparent in the lippmann - schwinger equation , where the asymptotic boundary conditions ( [ bcols5 ] ) and ( [ bcols6 ] ) are built into the @xmath56 of ( [ lseq2 ] ) , and vice versa .",
    "we then say that the analytical boundary conditions of the lippmann - schwinger equation select what is `` in '' ( @xmath0 ) and what is `` out '' ( @xmath57 ) or , equivalently , that the asymptotic behaviors select what is `` in '' ( [ bcols5 ] ) and what is `` out '' ( [ bcols6 ] ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions @xmath6 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 all are proportional to the regular solution @xmath17 : @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 as noted above , the analytical properties of the functions that multiply @xmath17 in ( [ dnesb])([lsdnesb- ] ) is what ultimately leads to different rsps .",
    "however , it is not always true that multiplying @xmath17 by a function of @xmath23 yields an eigensolution that generates a different rsp .",
    "for instance , the radial solution @xmath17 and the eigenfunction @xmath6 both lead to the same rsp .",

    "a general answer to this question is not known .",
    "of course , to know the answer one can always apply the sturm - liouville theory and see if @xmath63 yields the same rsp as @xmath17 .",
    "this may be impractical , though .",
