    "the electric pygmy dipole resonance ( pdr ) in nuclei is a subject of high current interest ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is expected to occur at energies well below the isovector giant dipole resonance ( ivgdr ) and may exhaust a considerable fraction of the total electric dipole ( @xmath4 ) strength in nuclei with a very asymmetric proton - to - neutron ratio .",
    "the properties of the mode are claimed to provide insight into the formation of a neutron skin @xcite , although this is still under debate @xcite .",
    "it may also constrain the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "thus , investigations of the pdr will be an important topic at future rare isotope beam facilities .",
    "furthermore , dipole strength in the vicinity of the neutron thresholds may lead to significant changes of neutron - capture rates in the astrophysical @xmath5-process @xcite .",
    "originally considered to be a single - particle effect @xcite , many microscopic models nowadays favor an explanation of the pdr as an oscillation of a neutron skin - emerging with an increasing @xmath6 ratio - against an approximately isospin - saturated core .",
    "this conclusion is based on the analysis of theoretical transition densities , which differ significantly from those in the ivgdr region .",
    "however , at least for stable nuclei with a moderate neutron excess this question is far from settled , see e.g.  the recent work of ref .",
    "quantitative predictions of the centroid energy and strength of the pdr and the corresponding collectivity as a function of neutron excess differ considerably .",
    "this is partly due to the properties of the underlying mean - field description ( e.g. , skyrme - type or relativistic models ) and partly results from the unclear separation between pdr and gdr .",
    "@xmath4 strength distributions at low excitation energy are also strongly modified in models allowing for complex configuration beyond the 1 particle - 1 hole ( @xmath7 ) level ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "data on the low - energy @xmath4 strength in very neutron - rich heavy nuclei are scarce @xcite .",
    "although the pdr strength is much weaker in stable nuclei , detailed spectroscopy with different isovector @xcite and isoscalar @xcite probes provides important insight into a possible interpretation of the mode as a neutron - skin oscillation , the interplay of collectivity and single - particle degrees of freedom and its isospin nature @xcite .",
    "extensive studies have been performed in stable even - mass nuclides utilizing the @xmath8 reaction , in particular at the shell closures @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath10 @xcite , @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite and in @xmath13pb @xcite . however , the connection of these results to the pdr in nuclei with very large @xmath6 ratios is not clear @xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "a systematic investigation of the pdr in the tin isotope chain is of special interest because a wide range of isotopes is experimentally accessible while the underlying structure changes only moderatly .",
    "pioneering experiments on the @xmath4 response below the ivgdr in the exotic isotopes @xmath14sn and its odd - mass neighbors have been reported @xcite .",
    "very recently , a new experiment has been performed at gsi aiming at an extraction of the complete @xmath4 response in @xmath15sn @xcite .",
    "if combined with results on the stable isotopes , for the first time a set of data spanning a large range of @xmath6 ratios from about 1.25 to 1.68 would be available , which can serve as a benchmark test for the validity of various theoretical approaches .",
    "indeed , the sn isotopes have been a favorite case in the model calculations studying features of the pdr as a function of neutron excess @xcite .",
    "experimental information on the low - energy @xmath4 strength in @xmath16sn and @xmath17sn is available from ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we report results from new @xmath8 experiments on @xmath2sn and @xmath3sn which allow to establish systematics of the low - energy @xmath4 strength over the range of stable even - mass tin isotopes . beyond the analysis of resolved transitions , in the present work a fluctuation analysis",
    "is applied to the ( @xmath1 ) spectra to investigate the amount of unresolved strength which might be hidden in the background because of the fragmentation due to the high level density .",
    "we also estimate in a statistical model approach @xcite the possible magnitude of corrections to the b(@xmath4 ) strengths deduced from the experiments due to unobserved decays to excited states .",

    "the principle of this method is to produce continuous bremsstrahlung spectra of real photons , extending up to the incident electron energy @xmath18 , which are then used to irradiate the target and simultaneously excite all transitions with a large decay width @xmath19 into the ground state ( g.s . ) in the given photon energy range .",

    "however , one should recognize that the experimental numbers do not include the unresolved part which almost doubles the @xmath60 values ( cf",
    ".  tab .",
    "[ tab : flucres ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the fluctuation analysis described in the previous section was limited to excitation energies up to 7.8 mev , and it can be expected that the contributions at higher @xmath69 are even larger . also ,",
    "the branching ratios to excited states are neglected although the corrections are expected to be of the order @xmath70% only in these semimagic nuclei ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ subsec : br ] ) .",
    "the comparison also shows strong sensitivity to the upper excitation energy limit .",
    "for example , restricting the upper limit of summation to 8 mev , qpm darmstadt and 2-phonon rqtba describe the experimental strength in @xmath2sn quite well . for @xmath3sn ,",
    "these models are somewhat too high but closer to the data than the other predictions .",
    "the differences found between the model approaches ( in particular , between qpm darmstadt and qpm giessen ) show that the description of the low - energy @xmath4 strength strongly depends on the modeling of the underlying mean field .",
    "the strength distributions are also sensitive to the interaction with multi - phonon states which redistribute the strength and can shift large parts in or out of the experimentally accessible energy region . as highlighted by the present examples ( tab .",
    "[ tab : sumtheo ] ) one can only put a word of warning to attempts to establish systematics of the pdr by summing over more or less arbitrarily defined excitation energy regions it should be pointed out that all models discussed here predict an increase of the strength of the pdr in the stable even - mass tin isotopes with neutron excess .",
    "however , the predictions of the energy region , where the pdr is confined , differ appreciably .",
    "one possible explanation of the strong variations in tab .",
    "[ tab : sumtheo ] may be slight differences in the onset of the gdr strength .",
    "the experimental observable ( @xmath60 strength ) does not allow any conclusion on the nature of the excitation , thus no separation into pdr and gdr contributions is possible .",
    "nevertheless , a linear increase of the summed strength with neutron excess is consistent with the data in @xmath71sn ( cf .  tab .",
    "[ tab : sum ] ) but clearly not for @xmath3sn . while the absolute corrections necessary to estimate the full experimental @xmath60 strength are large , the methods to estimate their magnitude described above and below predict similar correction values for all four isotopes",
    "thus , it is unlikely that the unexpected behavior of the low - energy @xmath4 strength in @xmath3sn is caused by the experimental limitations .",
    "the experimental sensitivity limits given in ref .",
    "@xcite should be considered in the comparison with the theoretical strength distributions as has been discussed in refs .",

    "are compared to the full qpm calculations ( open bars ) and taking into account the experimental sensitivity limits ( black bars).,width=321 ]    taking into account the sensitivity limit , the obserevable @xmath60 strength above 6 mev is significantly reduced . above 8 mev in @xmath2sn and 7.5 mev in @xmath3sn , the larger part of the strength stems from weak transitions which would be unobserved in the present experiments . for @xmath3sn , fairly good agreement with the experimental distribution is achieved after the correction , while for @xmath2sn the strength at higher excitation energies gets somewhat to small .",
    "the numbers of excited levels per energy interval is fairly well reproduced but slightly too small for @xmath2sn , while for @xmath3sn they are still overpredicted at higher energy .",
    "overall , as in a similar study of @xmath12 isotones @xcite , the agreement between experiment and qpm predictions clearly improves with consideration of the experimental thresholds .    the integrated @xmath60 strengths of 0.192 e@xmath65fm@xmath65 ( @xmath2sn ) and 0.132 e@xmath65fm@xmath65 ( @xmath3sn ) in the qpm calculations below the sensitivity limits are remarkably close to the amounts of unresolved strengths deduced from the fluctuation analysis .",

    "strong transitions as analyzed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : be1 ] are little affected by admixtures of weak transitions due to the mechanism discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fluc - method ] , while the mixing of transitions below the sensitivity limit may contribute to the fluctuations .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the good agreement is not fortituous but both methods allow an estimate of the quasi - continuum strength missed by a restriction of the data analysis to statistically significant peaks above background in the @xmath8 spectra .",
    "having two independent methods at hand is particularly helpful since their limits are defined by very different quantities . in case of the fluctuation analysis",

    "this work presents high - resolution nuclear resonance fluorescence experiments on @xmath2sn and @xmath3sn to investigate the @xmath4 response below the neutron threshold .",
    "the strongest transitions have been observed around the energy region of 6 - 7 mev and the distributions of extracted @xmath60 transitions have a resonance - like structure , but in the case of @xmath3sn the strength is more fragmented .",
    "the summed @xmath60 strengths are 0.175(24 ) e@xmath65fm@xmath65 and 0.164(31 ) e@xmath65fm@xmath65 with centroid energies 6.7 mev and 6.6 mev for @xmath2sn and @xmath3sn , respectively .",
    "a fluctuation analysis has been applied to the ( @xmath74,@xmath75 ) spectra to estimate the amount of unresolved strength which might be hidden in the background due to the finite energy resolution .",
    "the analysis is based on the autocorrelation function of the normalized spectrum which provides information about the mean level spacings in the investigated excitation energy interval .",
    "these can be compared to model prediction of the nuclear level densities which allows to adjust the background .",
    "three different theoretical models have been used , viz .",
    "bsfg1 @xcite , bsfg2 @xcite and hf - bcs @xcite .",
    "the backgrounds determined from these models produce a very similar amount of unresolved strength in the spectra and the differences between the models have been used to determine the uncertainties of this procedure .",
    "the fluctuation analysis shows that the amount of unresolved strength on ( @xmath74,@xmath75 ) spectra is significant and the method should be applied to other data taken with the nrf method , at least for medium - heavy and heavy nuclei where @xmath76 level densities in the energy region of the pdr typically fulfill eq .",

    "the qpm giessen and the rqtba calculations predict much larger strengths than the experimental results if summed over the experimentally accessed energy region up to 9 mev .",
    "however , the agreement of the 2-phonon rqtba predictions with the data is much better if the summation is restricted to an uper limit of 8 mev . despite the problems discussed above to extract the full @xmath4 strength from the @xmath8 data",
