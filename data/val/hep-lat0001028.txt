    "strongly interacting gauge - field theories , where perturbation theory is of no help , have been a long - standing problem .",
    "the theory of strong interactions , quantum - chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is probably the most well - known theory of this type .",
    "this paper is concerned with one approach to such problems , the hamiltonian description of the lattice version of gauge - field theory ( lgft ) . for most investigations in this area",
    "this is not the method of choice ; the majority of calculations on such theories are done within the lagrangian formalism .",
    "the main reason for this is the fact that , at least in principle , the lagrangian method is elegant and simple .",
    "it is based on a path - integral approach to the imaginary - time propagation .",
    "much work has been done to improve the accuracy of the monte carlo method used in the numerical implementation of the lagrangian approach , further increasing the viability of the method .",
    "thus , anyone wishing to pursue a different path needs first to build a strong case for the merits of their approach . for the form of the hamiltonian approach we shall consider in this paper we see four important advantages :    1 .",
    "the lagrangian approach , being based on an imaginary time evolution , does not allow easy access to the vacuum wave functional .",
    "by contrast , in the hamiltonian approach such a wave functional is at the core of the calculation , and we can not avoid to calculate it . once the vacuum wave functional is known , most properties of theories such as qcd , like confinement and chiral symmetry breaking , should follow automatically .",
    "time - dependent phenomena can only be discussed in a real time ( hamiltonian ) setting .",
    "the physical interpretation of the variables is more transparent .",
    "for example , electric and magnetic operators have their classical meaning .",
    "the hamiltonian approach can studied not only with numerical , but also with analytical techniques , so we can study low - lying excitations with a harmonic approximation and we can disentangle the dependence of observables on the parameters in the approximation .    these advantages are accompanied by important disadvantages . due to the fact that the hamiltonian requires a quantisation plane to be defined , we lose the manifest lorentz symmetry , that arises so naturally in the lagrangian approach . in the full solution to the hamiltonian problem",
    "this should be recovered , but approximations can introduce spuriosities .",
    "furthermore we have to fix the gauge , and the degrees of freedom in the hamiltonian formulation of the theory will then naturally depend on the choice of gauge .",
    "the issue of gauge fixing is a rather non - trivial exercise , as we shall see in this paper .",
    "we shall first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : hlatg ] , give a short introduction to our version of lattice gauge theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ham ] we then discuss how we can use the idea of a maximal tree to define a fully gauge - fixed hamiltonian , which is derived in an explicit form . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fc ] we discuss those constraints relating the trace of powers of @xmath7 matrices , and we define a symbolic method to construct eigenvalues of the electric energy operator , which should be useful in any approach to hamiltonian lgft .",
    "we then study the one plaquette problem in sec .",
    "[ sec : op ] , first in its generality , showing how we can derive a simple @xmath0-fermion problem equivalent to the @xmath7 one - plaquette problem .",
    "we discuss both the weak - coupling ( harmonic ) and the large-@xmath0 limits .",
    "explicit results for the one plaquette spectra as function of the coupling constant are shown for @xmath8 , and @xmath7 lgft s , with @xmath9 .",
    "finally we discuss the results and future directions in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the degrees of freedom in a gauge theory , such as electromagnetism , can be divided into two sets .",
    "the first set consists of the charges and currents in the system together with the associated static electric and magnetic fields .",
    "the second set contains the electromagnetic waves .",
    "however , since a charge in a moving frame is a current , relativistic coordinate transformations mix electric and magnetic variables . moreover , since the velocity of electromagnetic waves is constant , the two polarisation directions , perpendicular to the propagation direction , also undergo complicated transformations under a change of frame . therefore a relativistically invariant formulation of electromagnetism is very useful .",
    "as is well known , the lagrangian of electromagnetism , without static sources , @xmath10 can be formulated in terms of a covariant four - vector potential @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we use a notation in which roman indices @xmath15 run over the spatial , while greek indices @xmath16 run over the values @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of space dimensions and the temporal axis has index 0 .",
    "the introduction of the vector potential , or gauge field , serves a number of purposes .",
    "firstly , since the gauge field transforms as a vector , the lagrangian is now manifestly relativistically invariant .",
    "secondly , it is formulated in terms of canonical variables @xmath11 and @xmath19 which should make quantisation more straightforward ; and thirdly , the two constraints for the electric and the magnetic fields , the source - free maxwell equations @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are automatically satisfied .",
    "the price we pay for this is the appearance of superfluous degrees of freedom , the gauge , and an entanglement of the sources giving rise to these variables .",
    "the original abelian gauge theory of electromagnetism was extended by yang and mills @xcite using gauge fields of more complicated structure , including internal degrees of freedom .",
    "this generates self - interactions since the gauge fields do not commute , but are chosen to obey the commutation relations of a specific lie algebra .",
    "we shall concentrate on a gauge - field lagrangian where the field @xmath22 is an element of the lie algebra @xmath23 , @xmath24\\quad .\\ ] ] here the field tensor is the skew - hermitian matrix @xmath25 $ ] , and the field variable @xmath26 is an element of the algebra , conveniently parametrised as @xmath27 the @xmath28 are the @xmath29 generators of the lie algebra , satisfying the commutation relations @xmath30= { 2}i f^{abc}\\lambda ^{c}\\quad.\\ ] ] the index @xmath31 thus runs from @xmath32 to @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath28 can be represented by traceless @xmath33 matrices , normalised such that their squares have trace 2 , as can be seen from the anticommutation relations @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : parama ] ) we have absorbed the coupling constant @xmath35 in the field @xmath36 , so that we can interpret the fields geometrically , since the field tensor is now the curvature that follows from the covariant derivative @xmath37 \\quad,\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath38 = [ { \\pmb{f}}_{\\mu\\nu } , \\cdot ] \\quad .\\ ] ]    as we are interested in the hamiltonian , we perform the standard equal - time quantisation and reformulate the lagrangian in generalised electric and magnetic fields .",
    "this is strictly speaking a 3-dimensional result , since this interpretation requires the use of three - dimensional algebra .",
    "we shall nonetheless use the result below for other dimensions as well .",
    "we find @xmath39 \\quad,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "since we wish to impose the temporal gauge @xmath42 , we separate the hamiltonian in two parts , thereby isolating the @xmath43 dependent part : @xcite @xmath44_{{\\pmb{a}}_0 = 0 } + \\frac{1}{g^{2}}\\operatorname{tr}\\left [ { \\pmb{a}}_{0}{\\pmb{\\mathcal{g}}}+ { \\pmb{a}}_{0}{\\pmb{\\mathcal{x}}}({\\pmb{a}}_{0})\\right ] \\quad,\\ ] ] where we added a total divergence .",
    "the function @xmath45 is second order in @xmath46 and does not contribute to the equations of motion , or the constraint equations in the temporal gauge ( @xmath47 ) discussed below . since the time - derivative of @xmath46 does not occur in the lagrangian , the ( lagrangian ) extremal action variational principle leads to an equation of motion for @xmath46 that is a time - independent algebraic equation , which shows that the @xmath43 takes on a time - independent constant value .",
    "this set of equations ( one for each colour index ) are the non - abelian analogue of the gauss law constraint , which in the absence of colour charges take the simple form @xmath48 where @xmath49 = \\sum_{i=1}^d { \\pmb{d}}_i e_i^a\\quad .",
    "\\label{gss2}\\ ] ] the components of the fields can be obtained via the relation @xmath50 , \\quad e^{a}_{\\mu } = \\frac{1}{g}\\operatorname{tr}[{\\pmb{e}}_{\\mu } \\lambda^{a}]\\quad .\\ ] ] the constraints obey the same commutation relations as the generators of the gauge group .",
    "thus gauss law can not be implemented as a strict operator condition as it leads to contradictions , since the non - commuting constraints can not all be diagonalised simultaneously . however , within the physical ( in this case colourless ) subspace defined by @xmath51 no such problem arises , since the eigenvalue of the commutators is also @xmath52 .",
    "the space of states consists of wave functionals , which are functionals taking values on the @xmath7 group manifold .",
    "we find @xmath53 functional conditions on each wave functional , consisting of functions on the group manifold at each space point .",
    "as is well known , quantisation of problems involving redundant degrees of freedom ( i.e. , where some of the equations of motion are constraints ) is quite involved .",
    "the two main techniques used are dirac and brs quantisation , and they require a large amount of additional analysis . for more details",
    "one can consult the seminal work by dirac @xcite , as well as refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if we are able to work within the physical subspace only , one can ignore these formal problems and define the quantisation of the canonical momenta @xmath54 by @xmath55 which involves a functional derivative @xcite with respect to the field variables .    since @xmath56 is not dynamical , we can not associate a canonical momentum with it .",
    "we therefore use the temporal gauge , @xmath57 , which leaves us with residual gauge freedom @xmath58 independent of the time coordinate , i.e. , under the transformation @xmath59{\\pmb{\\phi } } ^{-1}({\\mathbf{x}})\\quad,\\\\ ^{{\\pmb{\\phi } } } { \\pmb{f}}_{\\mu \\nu } ( { \\mathbf{x } } ) & = &   { \\pmb{\\phi } } ( { \\mathbf{x}}){\\pmb{f}}_{\\mu \\nu } ( { \\mathbf{x}}){\\pmb{\\phi } } ^{-1}({\\mathbf{x}})\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 , the lagrangian is invariant .",
    "field theories suffer from singularities , both in the infrared and ultraviolet limits . in many interesting cases , such as qcd @xcite ,",
    "these are renormalisable . rather than dealing directly with the continuum",
    ", we shall regularise the problem by introducing a simple hypercubic lattice in the @xmath18-dimensional space , with lattice spacing @xmath31 .",
    "since we are pursuing a hamiltonian approach , time will remain continuous . in this paper",
    "we shall concentrate on pure gauge theory , without explicit charges ( i.e. , quarks ) . in this case",
    "the systems is described by a set of gauge fields @xmath61 at each point of the @xmath18-dimensional lattice .",
    "it looks like these could in principle carry @xmath62 degrees of freedom , as the group @xmath63 has @xmath53 generators @xmath64 .",
    "however , even after restricting the gauge fields by imposing the temporal gauge @xmath65 , the lagrangian is still invariant under a limited set of gauge transformations that do not violate the temporal constraint .",
    "thus the apparent number of degrees of freedom is still larger than that required to specify the dynamics uniquely .",
    "these superfluous degrees of freedom arise since we have not fully exploited the gauss law constraints .    in order to analyse this problem",
    "fully we first investigate the structure of the hamiltonian on the lattice .",
    "the gauge fields @xmath66 are hermitian , since @xmath64 is hermitian . in the schrdinger ( wave function )",
    "representation the effect of these fields can be incorporated as a non - abelian change of phase of the wave function between different points , a simple generalisation of the aharonov - bohm effect in qed .",
    "this geometric interpretation can be represented by a group element , a unitary transformation summing all the small phase changes along the path connecting the two points , @xmath67 where we have introduced a path - ordered product , denoted by @xmath68 , since the quantities @xmath69 for different values of @xmath70 are non - commuting matrices .    in practice",
    "we will only use this unitary transformation ( which for obvious reasons is also called a parallel transporter ) on a link between two nearest - neighbour lattice points @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a primitive lattice vector in the direction @xmath74 ( we shall use the bracket notation @xmath75 to denote nearest - neighbour pairs ) @xmath76 in eq .",

    "the quantity @xmath82 is a geometrical average of @xmath22 along the link @xmath83 in direction @xmath74 .",
    "since all future discussions will only concern this averaged field , we suppress the bar from here onwards .",
    "the four links around a primitive square ( usually called plaquette ) on the lattice will give , when we take the trace , the simplest gauge - invariant quantity on the lattice , and for that reason is often used in lattice problems . as an example we take a plaquette in the @xmath84 plane , @xmath85 ,",

    "we assume translational invariance , which restricts the number of independent coefficients in the wave functional considerably . correlations on a periodic lattice are truly translationally invariant . however , on a finite lattice , if we take the lattice size to infinity the system should have a inner region where translational invariance is observed . in practice",
    "we assume an infinite lattice .",
    "even though we have drastically reduced the number of degrees of freedom , additional complications arise when we impose colour neutrality on the wave function . here",
    ", the natural choice is to work with traces of products of the variables @xmath141 , as discussed above .",
    "a suitable approach would be to construct a basis of eigenstates of the electric part of the hamiltonian and calculate matrix elements of the magnetic energy between these states .",
    "such an approach is a quite natural calculational scheme for the hamiltonian approach .",
    "one can also use the method inherent in the lagrangian calculations , based on invariant integration over the full group @xcite , using monte carlo integration .",
    "however , for a proper hamiltonian approach this discards many of the advantages of the method .    to find eigenstates of the electric operator",
    ", one can resort to three general approaches .",
    "firstly , group theory gives us , in principle , a way to construct general eigenstates , the group characters .",
    "however , for a large basis , and @xmath142 , this is hopelessly involved @xcite , unless it can be automated , and we see no easy way to do this .    a second approach is based on integrating configurations , and constructing orthogonal combinations from them . in this case",
    "one must start off with much larger overcomplete sets of configurations and at increasing orders the integration , generally based on creutz s integration method @xcite , tends to be more and more involved @xcite .",
    "the third approach is based on the action of the electric operator itself , which leads to a block - diagonal matrix which has to be diagonalised to recover the eigenstates . in combination with a symbolic method",
    ", this seems to be the most powerful approach , which allows one to tackle any arbitrary @xmath7 group .",
    "we shall develop this method here .",
    "the method also applies to schemes other than the maximal tree method , and we shall therefore discuss it in a slightly more general framework ( see also refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we shall look at states in the colourless sector , where all variables can be formulated in terms of traces",
    ". clearly only ( products of ) traces defined over the same set of links can mix under the action of the electric operator ( since states with differing links are trivially orthogonal ) .",
    "within such a choice the full set of eigenstates separates into families which are characterised by the number of lines along each link . in the case of a single plaquette",
    "we have the collections : @xmath143 , @xmath144\\ } $ ] , @xmath144 ^ 2,\\operatorname{tr}[u^2]\\}$ ] , @xmath145,\\operatorname{tr}[u^2]\\operatorname{tr}[u],\\operatorname{tr}[u]^3 \\ } , \\cdots $ ] . within each collection",
    ", we can form linear combinations of the elements that are eigenstates of the electric operator . however , since for @xmath7 the contour @xmath146 $ ] with the winding number @xmath147 can be expressed in terms of contours with lower winding numbers , one finds , as one re - expresses these contours with higher winding numbers , that some eigenstates do not contain leading order terms , but reduce to states of other , lower - order , collections .",
    "the symbolic approach starts by writing explicit indices on all the traces , labelling the column indices @xmath148 .",
    "since every member function has no free indices , the set of row indices must be equal to the set of column indices , but the order in which they appear can clearly be different . actually , all the other members in the collection correspond to a distinct permutation , but not every permutation generates a new member of the collection .",
    "for example a segment with three lines has six permutations : @xmath149 where , in the case of a single loop , when one end of the segment is contracted with the other , the first element corresponds to @xmath150 ^ 3 $ ] , the next three elements to @xmath151 { \\rm tr}[u]$ ] , and the last two elements to @xmath152 $ ] .",
    "this follows easily if one considers the general form : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is a permutation of @xmath155 .",
    "however , in the case that two lines are connected in one loop @xmath156 and the last line is connected to a separate single - line loop @xmath157 , i.e. @xmath158 , all the permutations are distinct .    if we wish to evaluate the action of the electric part of the hamiltonian on such a segment @xmath159 , we first need to understand what happens if we look at a case where each electric operator acts on a different matrix @xmath79 , @xmath160 in the last step we have just changed the order in which we write the @xmath79 matrix elements , suggesting that we can interpret this part of the action of the electric fields as the interchange of @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the result eq .",
    "( [ eq : easpermu ] ) is based on a standard relation for the @xmath7 generators @xmath28 , @xmath163 using the relation ( [ eq : easpermu ] ) we find that the only non - trivial effect of the electric part of the hamiltonian is an exchange of pairs , @xmath164 - \\frac{l}{2n}\\left(\\left ( \\begin{matrix } n \\cr 2 \\end{matrix } \\right ) +",

    "note that the electric operator for the different @xmath7 groups is identical up to a multiple of the identity operator , so it will lead to the same diagrams for the eigenstates .",
    "differences follow from the fact that the point where states with higher winding numbers are no longer independent depends on @xmath0 .",
    "considering again the example discussed above of a three - line one - loop diagram for @xmath2 we find the states , by diagonalising the electric operator , @xmath167    in the one - loop case @xmath168 and @xmath169 vanish , and @xmath170 and @xmath171 are identical .",
    "explicitly , we find @xmath172 here @xmath173 are gegenbauer polynomials @xcite .",
    "the state labelled @xmath174 is actually the third eigenstate of the casimir operator of @xmath2 .",
    "in general the @xmath117th eigenstate for @xmath2 follows from the symmetric combination of the permutations of @xmath117 elements , as other combinations , which contain traces of higher powers of @xmath79 , collapse to lower eigenvalue states . in the example above @xmath170",
    "reproduces the first eigenstate .    in this way we can find eigenstates for fully linked traces ( i.e. , where the paths have a link in common )",
    "; we can obviously use these results to get eigenstates for unlinked traces by multiplying eigenstates of the separate segments .",
    "the eigenvalue corresponding to such eigenstates is the sum of the eigenvalues of each segment times their length .",
    "we also have not yet considered expressions containing both the matrices @xmath79 and @xmath175 . in that case",
    "the collection also contains elements where the indices of @xmath79 s and @xmath175 s are contracted with each other , which leads to a cancellation .",
    "however , this should be a straightforward extension .",
    "the above approach is designed for application with a many - body method such as the coupled - cluster method @xcite . before doing",

    "this last remaining matrix we call @xmath79 .",
    "the wave function depends on the trace of powers of the plaquette variable only , which can be re - expressed in terms of class label , a generalisation of the group characters @xmath176 .",

    "our hamiltonian is different from the naive kogut - susskind hamiltonian used in refs .",
    "@xcite , and this should have an important effect on the results we hope to obtain in our future work .",
    "the price we have to pay is that our hamiltonian has a preferred direction , and we have lost explicit translational invariance .",
    "it is probably worthwhile to investigate different , more symmetrical , choices of the maximal tree .",
    "it would seem that the current choice should be very good to consider the interaction between fixed sources , which clearly break translational symmetry , but it is less obviously optimal for a study of the vacuum .",
    "this work was supported by a research grant ( gr / l22331 ) from the engineering and physical sciences research council ( epsrc ) of great britain . + we thank prof .",
    "michael thies for a useful discussion of the fermionic treatment of the one - plaquette problem .",
    "as the @xmath63 one - plaquette problem can be mapped onto a one - dimensional @xmath380-fermion problem , we analyse the fermion problem in some depth to determine the spectrum and the action of a potential in coordinate representation .",
    "usually fermion problems are dealt with in operator form , here we use the knowledge of ( anti)symmetric functions to formulate the problem .",
    "an @xmath117-fermion wave function is in terms of single - particle orbitals @xmath381 given by the fully anti - symmetrised slater determinant @xmath382 if @xmath383 are chosen to be the lowest set of single - particle orbitals , in which @xmath384 is the weight function , which is the square root of the integration measure , and @xmath385 is the @xmath386-th orthogonal polynomial given that weight , then the wave function @xmath218 is the ground state wave function @xmath387 .",
    "only the linearly independent parts of each column in the slater determinant contribute , and these are just the highest powers in each polynomial @xmath388",
    ". therefore the ground - state slater determinant reduces to the vandermonde determinant @xmath389    as examples we deal with the infinite square well @xmath390 $ ] and the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the one - particle wave functions are given , respectively , by @xmath391 the sines and cosines can be re - expressed as polynomials in @xmath392 with the weight @xmath393 .",
    "the infinite domain of the harmonic oscillator is of no consequence as the weight damps the wave function at large distances .",
    "the non - interacting @xmath117-fermion ground state consists of fermions in the lowest @xmath117 levels .",
    "we find @xmath394}[n/2]!}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\prod _",
    "{ i=1}^{n}\\cos x_{i}\\prod _ { k < l}^{n}(\\sin x_{k}-\\sin x_{l})\\quad,\\\\ \\langle x|\\phi _ { 0}\\rangle _ { \\mathrm{h}.\\mathrm{o}. } & = & \\frac{1}{\\pi ^{n/4}}\\left ( \\prod _ { j=1}^{n-1}\\sqrt{2^{j}j!}\\right ) ^{-1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n!}}\\prod _ { i=1}^{n}{\\mathrm{e}}^{-x_{i}^{2}/2}\\prod _ { k < l}2(x_{k}-x_{l})\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the normalisation of the square - well wave function follows from de moivre s formula , and the normalisation of the harmonic oscillator wave function is a direct consequence of the normalisation of the hermite polynomials @xmath395 .",
    "we now consider an arbitrary excited state @xmath396 .",
    "since the anti - symmetry is present by the ground - state wave function , the wave function of an excited state can be factorised as a symmetric function of all the variables times the ground - state wave function . for any finite basis",
    ", this symmetric function must be a symmetric polynomial @xmath397 now the possible excitations follow from the theory of symmetric polynomials , and can be labelled as a distinct partition @xmath398 , where @xmath399 is the label of an occupied level , in ascending order .",
    "the symmetric polynomials are usually labelled independently of the degree of filling @xmath117 by the non - distinct partition @xmath400 where @xmath401 such that @xmath402 for @xmath403 .",
    "the non - distinct partition @xmath239 yields the excitation with respect to the fermi level ( see fig .",
    "[ fermiex ] ) .    generally , the symmetric functions @xmath404 are not of a definite degree and they have a normalisation that depends on @xmath117 .",
    "so @xmath405 refers to the leading order polynomial @xmath406 .",
    "these polynomials @xmath407 are the schur functions @xcite , @xmath408    for @xmath63 one - plaquette problem the excited states are symmetric polynomials in the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath409 .",
    "these polynomials are the schur functions , @xmath410 , and , as the eigenvalues lie on the complex unit circle , the symmetric polynomials are properly normalised .",
    "the eigenvalues of the electric operator follow directly from the definition .",
    "the two remaining problems are the action of the magnetic term on these states and how , and if , to express the symmetric polynomials , in the eigenvalues , again in terms of trace variables . for this purpose",
    "we introduce three representations : the schur functions @xmath411 , the monomial symmetric functions @xmath386 , and the so - called trace functions @xmath412 , @xmath413 the numbers @xmath405 denote a partition , and the @xmath367 label can be related to a partition by @xmath414 for instance , @xmath415 corresponds to @xmath416 .    from the relations between the different representations one can show that every excited state can be expressed as a product over traces .",
    "an excited state @xmath407 of the @xmath63 one - plaquette problem is a partition of length less than @xmath0 .",
    "if we use a lexicographical ordering @xmath417 @xcite , it means that @xmath418 contains only monomials @xmath419 where @xmath420 .",
    "it is easy to see that a trace function @xmath421 only contains monomials @xmath419 where @xmath422 .",
    "therefore , an excited state @xmath423 from eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) , can be expressed in terms of the @xmath246 independent trace variables , where @xmath424^{\\alpha _ { 1}}\\operatorname{tr}[u^{2}]^{\\alpha _ { 2}}\\cdots \\operatorname{tr}[u^{n-1}]^{\\alpha _ { n-1}}\\quad.\\ ] ]    we can thus express the anti - symmetric wave functions in terms of the symmetric trace variables .",
    "one can easily construct the transition , or kostka , tables @xcite for transformations between @xmath411 and @xmath386 , as well as @xmath412 and @xmath386 .    even though it is relatively straightforward to use trace variables for @xmath2 , it turns out to be rather involved to extend these relations to higher - dimensional gauge theories .",
    "for example , with the relations above we can determine the integration measure for trace variables .",
    "for @xmath2 we require the relations up to the partitions of 4 , while for @xmath3 we require similar relations for the partitions of 6 , @xmath425 where @xmath426 $ ] . however , the use for this relation for @xmath3 is restricted as the two complex trace variables @xmath427 and @xmath428 have complicated relations , and are restricted to a non - trivial domain of the complex space @xmath429 .",
    "note that there are only two independent angular variables for @xmath3 , which makes the angular variables much more useful than the trace variables .",
    "the haar measure @xmath430 reduces to the measure of the trace variables if the integrand depends only on the trace variables , @xmath431 where @xmath244 is a non - polynomial function of the trace variables @xmath432 .",
    "the magnetic terms in coordinate representation are just the multiplication of the state with @xmath433 and @xmath434 , where @xmath435 is @xmath436 .",
    "we can apply the littlewood - richardson rule for the general multiplication of two schur functions , @xmath437 however , since @xmath433 and @xmath434 are relatively simple we can derive multiplication rules from first principles , taking into account that the partitions can not be longer than @xmath246 . as symmetric polynomials we find ( @xmath438 ) , @xmath271 & = & x_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+\\cdots + x_{n}\\quad,\\\\ \\operatorname{tr}[u^{-1 } ] & = & x_{1}x_{2}\\cdots x_{n-1}+\\cdots + x_{1}x_{3}\\cdots x_{n}+x_{2}x_{3}\\cdots x_{n}\\quad,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use that @xmath439 . in terms of the partition @xmath405 of @xmath407 , multiplying with",

    "this relation can be generalised to the multiplication by @xmath192 $ ] for any power @xmath180 .",
    "this reduces to adding @xmath180 to each of the elements @xmath445 in the partition @xmath405 .",
    "the partitions should be ordered @xmath446 , and the non - distinct partitions dropped .",
    "in this section we prove that the electric operator in angular coordinates @xmath447 , @xmath448 the @xmath7 equivalent of eq .",
