    ", the far - ir range contains a large variety of molecular ( oh , h@xmath0o , high - j co ) and low excitation ionic / atomic transitions , in emission or in absorption , that can reveal the geometry and morphology of the circumnuclear and nuclear regions in galaxies .",
    "in particular far - infrared molecular lines could trace the expected conditions of x - uv illuminated dusty tori predicted from the unified models ( antonucci @xcite and whose presence in type 2 active galaxies is foreseen to reconcile the type1/type2 dichotomy .",

    "non - pdr components , such as dust - bounded photoionization regions , generating much of the fir continuum but not contributing significant [ cii ] emission , can explain the [ cii ] deficiency .",

    "modeling the three fir lines of oh suggests the gas lies in small ( 0.1pc ) and dense clouds ( @xmath5 ) in the nuclear region ( potentially a signature of the torus ) with a minor contribution from the circumnuclear starburst ring at 3kpc ( spinoglio _ et al . _",

    "2 shows the critical density ( i.e. the density for which the rates of collisional and radiative de - excitation are equal ) of each line as a function of the ionization potential of its ionic species .",
    "this diagram shows how these lines can measure two fundamental physical quantities ( density and ionization ) of the gas .",
    "lines from different astrophysical emission regions in galaxies are shown in the figure with different symbols .",
    "the ratio of two lines with similar critical density , but different ionization potential , gives a good estimate of the ionization , while the ratio of lines with similar ionization potential , but with diffrerent critical density , can measure the density of the gas in the region ( see , e.g. , spinoglio & malkan @xcite ) . from fig .",
    "2 it is clear that infrared spectroscopy has a thorough diagnostic power for gas with densities from about 10@xmath6 @xmath7 to as high as 10@xmath8 @xmath7 and ionization potentials up to 350 ev , using , to trace these extreme conditions , the so called coronal lines . moreover ,",

    "3 a diagram showing lines excited only in the highly energetic environments of agn and not from stellar ionization . in this diagram",

    "the photoionization models using the cloudy code ( ferland @xcite ) have been computed and shown as a grid in the diagram . as expected , the former ratio is sensitive to ionization , while the latter is sensitive to density . in the figure",
    "are also shown measurements on a small sample of seyfert galaxies for which we can determine the ionization potential ( basically the ratio of ionizing photons over the number of hydrogen atoms ) and the gas density .",
    "we note that the observed galaxies have average densities ranging from less than 10@xmath6 @xmath7 to less than 10@xmath9 @xmath7 and ionization potential of 10@xmath10 @xmath11 log  u @xmath11 10@xmath12 .",
    "this is in agreement , for the lower density objects , with conditions of `` coronal emission regions '' in agns ( spinoglio & malkan @xcite ) .",
    "another example , presented in fig .",
    "4 , is given by the [ cii]157@xmath1m/[oi]63@xmath1 m ratio as a function of the [ oiii]88@xmath1m/[oi]63@xmath1 m ratio .",
    "these low ionization lines are copiously produced in the ism of galaxies ( in photodissociation regions ) and the [ oiii ] line is excited also in hii regions .",
    "however we can see from this diagram that while normal galaxies are clustering in a central region that can easily be explained by starburst models , most of the seyfert galaxies are far from this locus and their rations can not be reproduced by starburst models .",
    "they have much stronger emission of [ oi]63@xmath1 m than it would be expected from stellar emission only . to obtain better statistics on this diagram",
    ", we will have to wait for the _ herschel _ satellite , that will have the sensitivity to collect far - infrared spectroscopic observations of large samples of local galaxies .",
    "lines have been plotted - for graphical reasons - at a ionization potential higher than their effective value.,width=453 ]    mid - ir and far - ir spectroscopy of fine - structure emission lines can be used not only in the local universe but also to measure the excitation conditions in distant cosmological objects .",
    "5 shows again , as in fig.2 , the critical density of the lines as a function of their ionization potential , not only for the local universe , but in three different redshift ranges , one for each frame , for which the rest - frame wavelength of the line is shifted in the far - infrared range .",
    "it appears from the figure that although the photodissociation ( pdr ) regime can be probed only in the relatively local universe , because of the long wavelengths of the lines tracing this regime , however , the stellar emission ( e.g. in starburst galaxies ) can be probed up to high z , using many lines in the rest - frame spectral range of 3 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath13 30 .",
    "moreover , the ionization from agn can be probed from the local universe up to redshifs of z@xmath135 and the extremely high excitation coronal emission regions are probed by near - ir lines shifted into the far - ir at a redshift of z @xmath15 5 .",
    "once we have proved that we have in the mid - to - far infrared the adequate diagnostic lines , we need still to understand if these lines could be detected by the future space facilities under development or study in the future years .",
    "do do so , we will use the observed infrared spectra in local galaxies and let them evolve backwards at earlier cosmological times .    @xmath1 m line and open circles the three oh lines detected in emission in ngc1068 .",
    "the solid lines show how the line fluxes change with redshift adopting luminosity evolution , while dotted lines without any evolution.,width=453 ]    for simplicity , and to cover as many transitions possible , we use a local object which contains both an active nucleus and a starburst , the bright prototype seyfert 2 galaxy ngc1068 .",
    "the iso spectrometers detected in this galaxy many of the lines plotted in fig . 2 at flux levels of 5 - 200 @xmath16 10@xmath17 w m@xmath18 ( alexander _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ; spinoglio et al .",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) . considering this galaxy as a template object ,",
    "we computed the line intensities expected at redshifts ranging from 0.1 to 5 . for simplicity",
    ", we adopted an einstein - de sitter model universe , with @xmath19 = @xmath20 and @xmath21= 1 , h@xmath22=75 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 .",
    "the luminosity distances have been derived using : @xmath24\\ ] ]    the results are reported in fig .",
    "6 , where the line intensities are given in w m@xmath18 , and the expected sensitivities of spectrometers , such esi ( european spica instrument , swinyard @xcite ) , onboard of the future space observatories , spica ( space infrared telescope for cosmology and astrophysics , isas - jaxa ) ( nakagawa @xcite ; onaka & nakagawa @xcite ) and firi ( far - infrared interferometer ) are also shown .",
    "we have assumed that the line luminosities scale as the bolometric luminosity and we have chosen two cases : + a ) a luminosity evolution proportional to the ( z+1)@xmath25 , consistent with the _ spitzer _ results at least up to redshift z=2 ( prez - gonzlez _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) ; + b ) no luminosity evolution .",
    "+ because the star formation process in galaxies was much more enhanced at z=1 - 2 than today , we consider reasonable to adopt the model with strong evolution at least for the stellar / hii region lines and , to be conservative , the `` no evolution '' one for the agn lines .",
    "+ we note that the dependence on different cosmological models is not very strong . the popular model with @xmath21= 0.27 , @xmath26=0.73 , h@xmath22=71 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 shows greater dilutions , increasing with z , by factors of 1.5 for z=0.5 to 2.5 for z=5 .",
    "in this case the line intensities of fig .",
    "6 would decrease by these factors .",
    "we conclude that a relatively low luminosity object like ngc1068 , with an infrared luminosity of 2 @xmath16 10@xmath27 l@xmath28 , will be detected up to a redshift of z=5 by the cooled 3.5 m mirror of the spica satellite in a few bright and important diagnostic lines , such as the [ oi]63@xmath1 m , the [ oiii]52@xmath1 m , [ oiv]26@xmath1 m , assuming luminosity evolution in the lines .",
    "the fainter agn lines ( like [ nevi]7.6@xmath1 m ) and the molecular lines of oh , will be detected by spica in such an object at z @xmath15 0.5 .",
    "for detecting the fainter lines up to z @xmath15 5 , we will have to wait for larger collecting area space telescopes , as the firi project , foreseen beyond the next decade .",
