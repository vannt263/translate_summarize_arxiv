    "this poses a question if the inflaton field can be decoupled from high scale physics above the scale of quantum gravity , so that an effective field theory description of inflation does make sense .",
    "an attractive solution to this puzzle is to introduce an approximate continuous shift symmetry along the inflaton direction . to implement this idea , in natural inflation",

    "also , under a reasonable assumption on the nonperturbative dynamics generating the axion potential , one can justify that the above simple potential provides a good approximation to the full inflaton potential .",

    "is required to have a super - planckian value .",
    "the recent bicep2 result makes the problem even more severe as it suggests  @xcite f 10 m_pl , where @xmath16 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "it appears to be difficult to get such a large axion decay constant from a sensible fundamental theory , particularly from string theory . in the limit where a controllable approximation is available , string theory",

    "<S> we extend the kim - nilles - peloso ( knp ) alignment mechanism for natural inflation to models with @xmath0 axions , which obtains super - planckian effective axion decay constant @xmath1 through an alignment of the anomaly coefficients of multiple axions having sub - planckian fundamental decay constants @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the original version of the knp mechanism realized with two axions requires that some of the anomaly coefficients should be of the order of @xmath3 , which would be uncomfortably large if @xmath4 as suggested by the recent bicep2 results . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the knp mechanism can be realized with the anomaly coefficients of @xmath5 if the number of axions @xmath6 is large as @xmath7 , in which case the effective decay constant can be enhanced as @xmath8 for @xmath9 denoting the typical size of the integer - valued anomaly coefficients . comparing to the other multiple axion scenario , the @xmath6-flation scenario which requires @xmath10 , the knp mechanism has a virtue of not invoking to a too large number of axions , although it requires a specific alignment of the anomaly coefficients , which can be achieved with a probability of @xmath11 under a random choice of the anomaly coefficients </S>",
    "<S> . we also present a simple model realizing a multiple axion monodromy along the inflaton direction . </S>"
