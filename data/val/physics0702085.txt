    "precision studies of neutron @xmath0 decay offer an excellent means to test the foundation of the standard model of electroweak interactions and to search for what may lie beyond it .",
    "in particular , the angular correlation between the neutron spin and the electron momentum ( characterized by the coefficient @xmath1 ) in polarized neutron @xmath0 decay provides important input for testing the unitarity of the ckm matrix  @xcite .",
    "recent technological advancements , including the realization of superthermal ultracold neutron sources  @xcite , have made experiments with a precession of @xmath2 within reach .",
    "consequently , it is imperative to control possible systematic effects at the 0.1% level .",
    "a typical experimental arrangement for @xmath1 coefficient measurements involves measuring the forward - backward asymmetry of electron emission with respect to the neutron spin in polarized neutron @xmath0 decay .",
    "possible sources of systematic effects include polarization determination , background , and detector effects such as electron backscattering . with regard to the detector effects",
    ", most of the previous experiments used plastic scintillation counters as the detector for the decay electron .",
    "however , due to the small end point energy of the electron spectrum ( @xmath3  kev ) , a significant fraction ( @xmath4 ) of electrons from neutron @xmath0 decay directed to one detector can backscatter from the surface of the detector and are detected by the other detector .",
    "a non - negligible fraction of the backscattered electrons leave undetectably small energy deposition in the first detector , hence introducing an error in the asymmetry determination .",
    "these electrons are called missed backscattered electrons .    one way to reduce the fraction of the missed backscattered electrons , and hence the effect of such events , is to use a detector that is sensitive to smaller energy deposition and can therefore have a lower energy threshold . in general , gas",
    "proportional counters are sensitive to a smaller energy deposition than plastic scintillation counters are . for a gas counter , an energy deposition of @xmath5",
    "ev is necessary to create one primary electron - ion pair , which generates on average four secondary electron - ion pairs . with a moderate gas gain of 10@xmath6 and an amplifier gain of 10  v / pc ,",
    "one obtains an output pulse of @xmath7  mv .",
    "therefore , an energy deposition of 100  ev can be relatively easily detected .",
    "on the other hand , for a plastic scintillation detector , an energy deposition of 100  ev is necessary to create one photon inside the scintillator .",
    "if a typical value of 15% for the photocathode quantum efficiency of the photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) and a rather generous value of 25% for the light collection efficiency are assumed , we obtain a 2.5  kev energy deposition for a single photoelectron event .    a detector system comprised of a thin low pressure multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) placed in front of a plastic scintillator serves as an ideal @xmath0 detector : the thin mwpc provides sensitivity to backscattered events with small energy deposition while the plastic scintillator provides the total energy information as well as the timing information , which is of vital importance in analyzing a class of events in which both detectors record a hit as a result of backscattering .",
    "in addition , the position information from the mwpc can be used to apply a fiducial volume selection , which is of vital importance in experiments that use ultracold neutrons ( ucn ) .",
    "also , by requiring a coincidence between the mwpc and the scintillation counter for the event trigger , the sensitivity to @xmath8 rays , one of the major background sources in previous experiments , can be reduced because of the relatively low sensitivity of mwpcs to @xmath8 rays .",
    "the ucna experiment  @xcite , currently being commissioned at los alamos national laboratory , aims at a 0.2% measurement of the @xmath1 coefficient using ucn , and uses such a combination as the @xmath0 detector .    in this paper",
    ", we describe the design and construction of the mwpc developed for the ucna experiment , and report the results from the initial offline performance tests .",
    "the design and construction of the plastic scintillation detector , together with the performance of the mwpc as installed in the ucna spectrometer will be reported in a later publication  @xcite .",
    "in the ucna experiment , ucn are produced by the lansce solid deuterium ucn source , sent through a polarizer / spin flipper , and then introduced into a decay volume .",
    "the wall of the decay volume is a 3  m - long diamond coated quartz cylinder 10  cm in diameter .",
    "the decay volume is in the warm bore of a superconducting solenoidal magnet ( scs ) , which provides a holding field of 1  t. the decay electrons spiral along the magnetic field lines towards one of the detectors , and then enter the field expansion region , where the magnetic field is reduced to 0.6  t. as an electron enters the field expansion region , the energy associated with the angular motion of the electron is transfered to longitudinal motion in order to conserve angular momentum as the diameter of the spiral increases due to the reduced field .",
    "this reduces the incident angle of the electron onto the detector surface ( reverse of the magnetic mirror effect ) and suppresses backscattering .",
    "the detectors are placed in a region where the expanded field is uniform .",
    "the schematic of the ucna experiment is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ucna_schematic ] .",
    "the function of the ucna mwpc is two - fold : 1 ) to minimize the missed backscattered events , and 2 ) to provide position information .",
    "the latter is necessary because , unlike the previous @xmath1 measurements that used a cold neutron beam , in the ucna experiment the ucn fill the decay volume .",
    "therefore it is important to place a fiducial volume cut to reject events in which the @xmath0 decay occurred near the wall of the decay tube where it is likely for the electron to hit the wall .    a general consideration for minimizing missed backscattered events results in the following requirements for the design of the mwpc , in particular for the windows and the gas .",
    "* the entrance and exit windows have to be thin .",
    "* the gas has to be at low pressure , and has to consist of relatively heavy molecules made of low @xmath9 ( = atomic number ) atoms .",
    "the requirements for the windows is obvious as any event in which the electron gets backscattered from the entrance window without getting into the gas volume will become a missed backscattered event .",
    "the gas pressure has to be low in order to make the entrance window thin , since it separates the mwpc gas volume from the spectrometer vacuum .",
    "also , in order to minimize the backscattering , the gas should only contain atoms with low @xmath9 ( = atomic number ) , since the total backscattering fraction is larger for a larger @xmath9  @xcite . at the same time , in order to have a high enough detection efficiency , the mwpc gas has to have a reasonable electron density .",
    "this calls for a gas that consists of relatively heavy molecules made of light atoms .",
    "furthermore , there are two requirements for the ucna mwpc design that are specific to the ucna experiment .",
    "these are requirements for the position resolution and the actual geometrical size of the mwpc .    *",
    "the maximum diameter of the spiral of the electron trajectory in the field expansion region is 6.6 mm . in order to perform a fiducial volume selection with a minimum loss of statistics , a position resolution of @xmath10",
    "mm is required . * because of the field expansion factor of 0.6 ( 0.6 t/1.0 t ) , the 10  cm diameter cross section of the decay volume maps to a circle with @xmath11  cm diameter in the field expansion region . on the other hand ,",
    "the diameter of the warm bore the scs magnet is 25.4  cm .",
    "therefore , the ucna mwpc has to have an effective area larger than 14  cm in diameter and has to fit in the warm bore with a diameter of 25.4  cm .",
    "there is an additional consideration associated with the exit window . in the ucna experiment ,",
    "the exit window separates the mwpc gas volume from the volume in which the plastic scintillation detector is placed .",
    "the exit window can be made thin by filling the volume in which the plastic scintillator is placed with a gas that is of the same pressure as the mwpc gas .",
    "below , we will discuss each of these aspects of the design in more detail .",
    "figure  [ fig : mechanical ] shows the cross section of the detector assembly , which in normal operation is inserted into the vacuum inside the scs warm bore .",
    "figure  [ fig : mechanical_details ] shows the cross section of the mwpc and figs .",
    "[ fig : mwpc_pic1 ] and [ fig : mwpc_pic2 ] are photographs of the mwpc .",
    "the chamber body and the chamber lid , both made of aluminum , constitute the body of the mwpc itself and enclose the mwpc gas , which is 100 torr neopentane ( see section  [ sec : gas ] ) .",
    "the mwpc , the plastic scintillator , the light guide system , and the photomultipliers are housed in the detector housing .",
    "the detector housing consists of a about 25 in .",
    "long stainless steel nipple with an outer diamter of 10.5 in .",
    ", an aluminum cylinder with an outer diameter of about 12 in . , an end cap and a front cap made of aluminum .",
    "the stainless steel nipple and the aluminum cylinder are connected via 12-in .",
    "conflat flanges .",
    "the aluminum cylinder is welded onto a 12-in .",
    "flange made of explosion bonded aluminum - stainless steel bi - metal .",
    "the detector housing is filled with 100 torr nitrogen .",
    "this is to minimize the pressure difference across the mwpc back window so that the back window can be thin .",
    "the space enclosed by the aluminum cylinder , the front cap , and the chamber lid houses the preamplifier for the mwpc readout and the hv systems for the mwpc operation .",
    "the difficulties associated with operating the hv system in a 100 torr nitrogen environment will be discussed in section  [ sec : hv ] .",
    "the chamber body , the chamber lid , the front cap are designed so that when the front cap is mounted on the aluminum cylinder it pushes the chamber lid making the o - ring seal between the chamber body and the chamber lid , the o - ring seal between the chamber lid and the front cap , and the o - ring seal between the front cap and the aluminum cylinder .",
    "also it makes the electrical connection between the connectors on the chamber lid and the wire planes when the front cap is mounted on the aluminum cylinder pushing the chamber lid on the chamber body ( see figs .",

    ".,width=377 ]              the requirements discussed earlier that the wire chamber gas consist of relatively heavy molecules made of low @xmath9 atoms and practical requirements ( availability , affordability , etc ) limited our choices for the gas almost uniquely to heavy hydrocarbon gases .",
    "we chose neopentane ( c@xmath12h@xmath13 , also known as 2,2-dimethylpropane ) because of the high vapor pressure at room temperature ( 1125  torr ) .",
    "typically we operated the wire chamber at 100 torr , which is safely below the vapor pressure .",
    "also , as discussed below , we were able to develop a thin window that can safely withstand a 100 torr pressure difference .",
    "neopentane at 100  torr has a electron density of @xmath14/@xmath15 . for comparison",
    ", p10 gas at 1 atm has an electron density of @xmath16/@xmath15 .",
    "thus we expect a reasonably similar detection efficiency for 100 torr neopentane compared to 1 atm p10 gas , provided that we get a reasonably good gas gain and charge collection .",
    "we note that n - pentane ( normal pentane , c@xmath12h@xmath13 ) has already been used as a proportional chamber gas .",
    "ref  @xcite discusses the use of gas mixtures of n - pentane - co@xmath17 , n - pentane - co@xmath17-ch@xmath18 , and n - pentane - co@xmath17-cf@xmath18 , while ref .",
    "@xcite discusses the use of various hydrocarbon gases such s isobutane , ethylene , n - pentane , and n - heptane at very low pressures ( @xmath19 torr ) .",
    "although n - pentane is more cost effective than neopentane , it is not a practical choice for the following reasons :    * the high reactivity , which would considerably limit the material allowed for the construction of the mwpc . * the low vapor pressure ( 424  torr at 20@xmath20c ) , which would make the operation of the gas panel more demanding to avoid accidental liquefaction of the gas .",
    "we will discuss the measured properties of neopentane as a wire chamber gas in section  [ sec : gasproperties ]      heavy hydrocarbon gas such as isobutane is commonly used as a quencher gas , not as the main component of the wire chamber gas . in order to obtain a high enough gain from neopentane , which is also a heavy hydrocarbon gas , a wire with a small diameter has to be used for the anode wire plane .",
    "we chose to use gold - plated tungsten wires with a diameter of 10  @xmath21 m .",
    "64 anode wires are strung with a 2.54  mm spacing , giving an effective area of 163  mm @xmath22 163  mm , and are soldered onto a 0.092-in .",
    "thick fr4 glass epoxy frame .",
    "a tension of 9  gf , which is about 80% of the breaking point of the wire , was applied to each wire .",
    "all the anode wires are connected together by conductor tracks etched onto the fr4 glass epoxy plate , which are then connected to the hv resistor located outside the mwpc through an shv feedthrough connector mounted on the chamber lid ( see sections  [ sec : mechanical ] and [ sec : hv ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : mechanical_details ] ) .    in order to minimize electron backscattering ,",
    "we chose to use wires also for the cathode planes , instead of more conventionally used thin strips of conductor etched on a substrate such as mylar sheet  @xcite .",
    "the entrance and exit windows can not be used as the cathode planes because the thin windows bow out by up to 1  cm ( as measured at the center ) due to the pressure difference across the windows . also , the use of wires instead of conductor strips etched on a thin substrate facilitated the pump - out operation necessary prior to filling the mwpc with 100 torr neopentane .",
    "gold - plated aluminum wires 50  @xmath21 m in diameter were used for the cathode planes .",
    "each cathode plane has 64 wires , strung with a 2.54  mm spacing with a 50  gf tension and soldered onto a 0.092-in .",

    "( there are 16 strips on each cathode plane . )",
    "the card edge connectors then provide a connection to the outside of the mwpc through feedthrough connectors on the chamber lid , on which multi channel systems cpa16 amplifier carrier boards are mounted  @xcite ( see sections  [ sec : mechanical ] and [ sec : readout ] ) .",
    "wire planes were constructed using a wire - winding machine built according to ref .",
    "the wire - winding machine was originally built for time projection chambers for the drift dark matter search experiment  @xcite .",
    "we modified it replacing the weight that provides a constant tension to the wire with a hysteresis clutch / brake  @xcite which provides a constant torque , for a simpler operation .",
    "the wire was wound onto a frame made of aluminum , and then transfered onto the g10 frame .",
    "the distance between the anode plane and a cathode plane was chosen to be 10  mm , about 4 times the anode wire spacing  @xcite .",
    "the two cathode planes are mounted in such a way that the wires on one plane run perpendicular to the wires on the other plane , thus providing positional information in both directions that are perpendicular to the axis of the scs spectrometer ( see fig .",

    "the cathode planes are designed so that they can be held at a positive potential ( up to @xmath23 400  v ) with respect to the windows which are grounded .",
    "the anode plane then is held at a positive potential ( @xmath23 2700 v ) with respect to the cathode planes .",
    "the anode bias high voltage is supplied through a 25 m@xmath24 resistor ( see fig .  [",

    "the 25 m@xmath24 resistor , the 6.8 nf capacitor , and the 3.3 nf decoupling capacitor were all enclosed in a box ( `` hv box '' ) that was filled with araldite 2011 epoxy  @xcite to prevent discharge due to the low pressure ( 100 torr nitrogen ) environment .",

    "[ fig : readout ] . as discussed in section  [ sec : wireplanes ] the signals from all the anode wires are summed on the anode wire plane , providing the information on the total energy deposited in the mwpc . the signals from every four neighboring cathode wires are summed , giving 16 channels to read out for each cathode plane . for the given cathode - anode plane distance ( 10  mm )",
    ", the distribution of the induced charge on the cathode planes has a width of about 2  cm ( fwhm ) , thus three to four cathode strips ( each strip is a collection of four neighboring cathode wires ) receive a detectable signal for each hit on the mwpc .",
    "the center of gravity of the signals of each cathode plane provides the coordinate of the location of the avalanche in the direction perpendicular to the cathode wire . combining the information from both cathode planes determines the location of the avalanche .",
    "the summed anode signal is extracted to the outside of the mwpc through an shv feedthrough connector and fed to a multi channels system pa3300 amplifier module through a decoupling capacitor of 3.3  nf ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : readout ] ) .",

    "the epoxy hardened on the surface of the mylar sheet causes a tear to develop when the window is subject to a pressure difference and needs to bow in or out . machining a groove on the window frame to capture the excess epoxy ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : window ] ) substantially improved the longevity of the windows .",
    "thin kevlar reinforced mylar windows are discussed in ref .",
    "however , our method differs from that in ref .  @xcite as follows . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the window is of a cylindrical shape , and therefore the best performance was obtained when the kevlar fibers were glued on the surface of mylar sheet preformed to a cylindrical shape . in our case ,",
    "the window is glued onto a flat circular frame , and yields to some radius when a pressure difference is applied across the window .",
    "if the kevlar fibers are directly glued on to the surface of the mylar sheet , it tends to rip the mylar sheet off as the window bows out under a pressure difference .",
    "the best performance was obtained when the kevlar fibers are only fixed on the frame , allowing them to move against the surface of the mylar sheet when it bows out under a pressure difference .",
    "the entrance window withstands a pressure difference of up to 200  torr .",
    "we chose this configuration as a result of a compromise between the strength ( and the leak rate ) and the amount of material .",
    "for example , 3  @xmath21 m mylar sheet could not be used because of the high leak rate due to pin holes on the sheet .",
    "the exit window is 15  cm in diameter and is made of 6  @xmath21 m thick aluminized mylar sheet . since there is only a small pressure difference ( @xmath25  torr ) , there is no need for kevlar reinforcement .",
    "the function of the gas handling system is as follows .    * in normal operation , it maintains the mwpc gas pressure at 100  torr within 1% , while flowing gas into the mwpc at a rate of @xmath26  cc / min .",
    "it also maintains the pressure in the nitrogen volume to be @xmath25  torr below the mwpc gas pressure .",
    "* during the initial pump - out , it evaculates the mwpc and the nitrogen volume while keeping the pressure difference across the front and back window within the limit given for each window .",
    "* it protects the mwpc windows and the wire planes in case of accidents , including a loss of the scs vacuum and a power failure .",
    "figure  [ fig : gaspanel1 ] shows how the constant gas flow and the constant pressure in the mwpc volume and the constant gas pressure in the nitrogen volume are maintained during normal operation ( the first item listed above ) . the mass flow controller ( mks type 1179a )",

    "the pressure of the gas in the mwpc gas volume is measured by a capacitance manometer ( mks baratron 626  @xcite ) , and the pressure information is used by a controller ( mks type 146c ) that controls the pressure valve .",

    "this , combined with simulations , indicates that the position of the center of the spiral of each beta particle entering the mwpc can be determined to better than 1.5  mm once the mwpc is put in the 0.6  t magnetic field of the field expansion region of the scs magnet , which will greatly suppress the multiple scattering effect ( see the bottom panel of fig .",
