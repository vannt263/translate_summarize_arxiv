    "polyelectrolytes are long - chain molecules with ionizable side - groups @xcite . in a polar solvent",
    ", these ionizable groups can dissociate resulting in localized charges along the backbone of the polymer forming a `` macroion '' , plus mobile counterions that are no longer permanently bonded to the chain . due to the long - range nature of the electrostatic interactions , the counterions ,",
    "though mobile , are not entirely uncorrelated with the macroions . for polyelectrolytes with a sufficiently high charge density along the backbone , some of the counterions remain bound to the chain .",
    "this phenomenon is known as `` counterion condensation '' .",
    "the qualitative theory of counterion condensation has been worked out by manning @xcite for long rodlike polyelectrolytes at infinite dilution . within the manning theory ,",
    "counterion condensation occurs when the distance between charges @xmath0 along the chain is sufficiently small ( i.e. the charge density is sufficiently high ) compared to the length scale set by the electrostatic interactions @xmath1 ( @xmath2 being the charge , @xmath3 the dielectric constant and @xmath4 the thermal energy ) .",
    "counterions continue to condense onto the macroions , resulting in a renormalized charge density along each chain , until the effective average charge separation @xmath5 equals @xmath6 .",
    "manning s theory provides a lucid picture for understanding counterion condensation , but its simplicity invites more complex questions . for example , it is not clear how the qualitative features of the theory would be modified by having flexible chains .",
    "equally unclear is how the essential results of the theory can be generalized to nonzero concentrations instead of just at infinite dilution .",
    "recent experiments @xcite , theories @xcite and simulations @xcite have attempted to address some of these issues , but no consistent picture has yet emerge .",
    "another issue related to counterion condensation concerns the possibility of attractive interactions between two or more like - charged chains .",
    "there is now convincing evidence , both numerical @xcite and analytical @xcite , that attractive interactions can exist between rodlike polyelectrolytes with the same charge .",
    "this attraction is mediated by the fluctuating charge density along the rods created by the condensed counterions when they move on and off the rods , leading to an effective van der waals - like interaction .",
    "but the same question for flexible polyelectrolyte chains is still open .",
    "since flexible chains can undergo conformational changes as the degree of counterion condensation changes and deviation from linearity in turn affects the degree of counterion condensation , these two factors become highly convoluted and their net effects on the attractive interaction is unclear .",
    "this paper will try to address some of the issues raised here for solutions of flexible polyelectrolytes at nonzero concentrations .",
    "the complexity of the problem demands a careful treatment of the relevant microscopic interactions involved .",

    "special handling of the coulombic interaction is necessary in a solution with finite concentration .",
    "the minimum image convention is usually sufficient for short range interactions , but the long range nature of the coulomb potential causes a pair of charges to interact far beyond their first periodic image .",

    "this is a difficult question to answer .",
    "interchain attraction can arise from the charge fluctuations along the backbone of the rods as condensed counterions come on and off the rods .",
    "but this is not the only mechanism possible .",
    "ray and manning recently suggested that two like - charged rods can share counterions in such a way to form what is analogous to a covalent bond @xcite .",
    "the effective distance scale of this covalent - like interaction is predicted to be of the order of the debye - hckel screening length , which is much longer than the intrachain distance here .",
    "therefore , the first mechanism is more likely to be correct for the attractive intrachain interactions .",
    "however , more work is necessary to fully elucidate the origin of the intrachain attraction .",
    "the attractive interactions are evident only for solutions with very large bjerrum lengths . for smaller @xmath6 ,",
    "the chains are apparently well extended . for these cases , the intrachain attractions , if present ,",
    "are not strong enough to overcome the coulombic repulsion between different parts of the same chain .      the most straightforward way to determine whether interchains attraction exists is to calculate the free energy as a function of the separation between two chains . theoretically , this could be done by an umbrella sampling procedure @xcite or by computing the potential of mean force of separating two chains @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due the long - range nature of the coulomb potential , both of these methods suffer from heavy statistical noise .",
    "compounded by the need to deal with a finite polymer concentration ( i.e. multiple chains ) , these direct methods are not always very useful in practice .",
    "an alternative is to monitor the radial distribution function @xmath46 of the centers - of - mass of the polyelectrolyte chains .",

    "these chains are shorter than those used for obtaining the results shown in the last two subsections .",

    "again , by integrating under the short - distance peak in @xmath46 , we can estimate the average number of neighbors each chain has , and the results are tabulated in table  [ tab3 ] for the two highest concentrations . for instance , the peak in @xmath46 for @xmath64 and concentration @xmath65 indicates that each chain has approximately 1.8 neighbors on the average within a distance of @xmath66 around it .",
    "= 0.85    = 0.85    notice that in spite of the sharp peak observed at short distance , there are no other distinct secondary peaks .",
    "if a large number of chains come together to form a large - scale structure , there would have been second and third neighbor peaks evident in @xmath46 .",
    "the absence of these peaks suggests that most of the intensity under the sharp peak at short distance is in fact due to small clusters , in agreement with the data in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "indeed , a visual examination of the configurations indicates that most of the chains are forming pairs or triplets . examples of pairs are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - pairs ] .",
    "the precise reason for the absence of larger clusters is not clear at this point .",
    "there are several possibilities : ( a ) some special feature of the attractive interchain interaction causes chains to form small clusters but precludes the creation of larger clusters ; ( b ) the number of chains used in the simulations is too small to accurately reflect the presence of large - scale structures ; or ( c ) the lengths of our simulations are not long enough for the true equilibrium large - scale structures to emerge .",
    "larger simulations are needed to determine the actual reason for the apparent absence of large clusters .",
    "= 0.5    also interesting is the @xmath6 dependence of the position of the small - distance peak .",
    "this is most clearly seen for the highest concentration .",
    "starting from @xmath6 = @xmath57 , the peak position shifts consistently to smaller values , from about @xmath66 to @xmath67 at @xmath6 = @xmath63 .",
    "a similar trend can be seen in data for the intermediate concentration .",
    "the data in the radial distribution function demonstrate unequivocally that attractive interchain interactions do exist in solutions of like - charged flexible polyelectrolytes .",
    "the strength of this attraction also grows with polyelectrolyte concentration and the bjerrum length .",
    "these attractive interactions lead to clustering of chains , which should be observable in neutron and light scattering experiments .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested that the broad peak detected in recent neutron and light scattering experiments @xcite at small wavevectors may actually be related to the formation of clusters or domains @xcite .    to verify the connection between the short - distance peak observed in the polymer center - of - mass radial distribution function and the broad low - wavevector peak detected in the scattering intensity , we can compute the structure factor @xmath68 from the simulation data and compare them to the experiments . unfortunately ,",
    "due to the small size of the simulation box used , the number of allowed wavevectors dictated by the periodic boundary condition we have used is extremely sparse at the low - wavevector region . instead of fourier transforming the monomer density directly to get @xmath68",
    ", we first computed the monomer - monomer radial distribution function @xmath69 and then @xmath68 from it using the formula @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the fourier transform of @xmath72 and @xmath73 is the monomer density .",
    "we have compared the @xmath68 computed this way with a direct fourier transform of the density , and found the qualitative features to be identical .",
    "= 0.95    using the monomer radial distribution function offers another advantage .",
    "it allows us to separate the inter- and intra - chain contributions to the total scattering intensity .",
    "figure  [ fig - gm ] shows the total monomer @xmath69 for @xmath74 and @xmath65 . clearly , the total ( intra - chain plus inter - chain ) @xmath69 is dominated by the intrachain correlations at short distance .",
    "the inset shows only the inter - chain contribution to @xmath69 at a much expanded scale as the solid line .",
    "also in the inset , superimposed on the monomer @xmath69 is the polymer center - of - mass @xmath46 for the same @xmath6 and concentration taken from fig .",
    "[ fig - gr-1 ] .",
    "clearly , the interchain contribution to @xmath69 closely resembles the polymer @xmath46 we discussed earlier . from the interchain contribution to @xmath69",
    ", we can then compute the part of the structure factor @xmath68 that arises solely from the interchain correlation , and this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - sq ] .",
    "the @xmath68 shows a broad peak with a maximum at @xmath75 . by truncating the fourier integral at different upper limits",
    ", we can verify directly that the peak in @xmath68 is essentially due to the first and second peaks in @xmath69 .",
    "we found similar results for all other concentrations and bjerrum lengths .",
    "= 0.70    although we have correlated the peak in the structure factor to the attractive short - distance peak in the polymer @xmath46 , the accuracy of our data precludes a reliable determination of how @xmath76 scales with the polymer concentration .",
    "the reason for this is that although we have seemingly circumvented the problem of the sparseness of the allowed wavevectors by analyzing the monomer radial distribution function , the periodicity in principle does not permit us to extract real independent information about @xmath77 for wavevectors @xmath78 which do not correspond to reciprocal vectors of the cubic boundary condition we employ . if the actual peak lies between two reciprocal vectors ,",
    "we would not be able to accurately measure its position . given the size of the simulation box we have used for these calculations , the reciprocal vectors are certainly too sparse .",
    "a much larger simulation would be required for a direct comparison with experimentally obtained scattering intensities .",
    "finally , we can compare the general characteristics of the attractive interactions seen in our simulations of flexible polyelectrolytes with those of the rigid rods observed in previous theoretical work @xcite .",
    "first , the attractive interactions between the flexibles are strongly concentration dependent whereas for the rods they exist even for infinite dilution .",
    "this is not really very surprising , given the fact that the attractive interactions are results of charge fluctuations due to the condensed counterions .",
    "for infinite rods , condensation could occur even at zero concentration , but for flexibles it could not .",
    "the degree of counterion condensation for flexibles increases with concentration , and so should the strength of the attractive interactions .",
    "secondly , the distance scale of the attractive interactions seems to be very different in the flexibles compared to the rods . for rods ,",
    "previous calculations show that the attractive interactions are very short - ranged , of the order of 10 or 20  . for the flexibles , if we assume a monomer size of roughly 4  , the typical position of the peaks observed in @xmath46 from figs .",
    "[ fig - gr-0 ] to [ fig - gr-6 ] would be anywhere from 30 to 100  , depending on the concentration and the bjerrum length .",
    "on the other hand , these distances scales are very much in accord with those suggested by neutron and light scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "we have carried out detailed molecular dynamics simulations to study inter- and intra - chain interactions in solutions of flexible polyelectrolytes at nonzero concentrations with no added salt .",
    "the simulations were performed with explicit counterions and unscreened coulombic interactions . specifically , we investigated questions related to the existence of effective attractive interactions as well as the nature of counterion condensation at finite concentration .    from the counterion self - diffusion coefficient , we were able to determine how counterion condensation depends on both the bjerrum length and the polymer concentration .",
    "the data revealed a condensation mechanism that is distinctly different from that predicted from manning theory .",
    "specifically , we observed no saturation in the renormalized charge fraction on the chains which appeared to be a smooth function of the bjerrum length as well as the polymer concentration .    from the scaling of the mean squared radii of gyration with the chain length , we extracted the scaling exponent under a number of different conditions with various bjerrum lengths and concentrations . for large bjerrum lengths and high polymer concentrations , a scaling exponent smaller than a gaussian chain",
    "was observed , indicating that the chains had a more compact structure than ideal chains . in conjunction with a visual examination of the chain conformations",
    ", we concluded that the compact structures are results of attractive interactions between different parts of the same chain .    to ascertain the presence of attractive interchain interactions , we have studied in great detail the radial distribution functions of the centers - of - mass of the chains in solution .",
    "we found a peak at small distances in the radial distribution function for high bjerrum lengths and/or high concentrations . from the lack of secondary peaks in the radial distribution function and a careful examination of the chain configurations",
    ", we concluded that this peak is a result of small domains formed by chains clustering in the solution .",
    "this behavior is indicative of the presence of strong interchain attractions . from the structure factor , we have directly verified the connection of the small - distance peak in the polymer radial distribution with the broad peak detected at small wavevectors in the experimental small - angle x - ray and light scattering intensities .    throughout this work",
    ", we benefited from numerous enlightening discussions with andrea liu and eric amis .",
