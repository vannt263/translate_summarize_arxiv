    "recently , there was a great increase of interest in the study of the physics beyond the standard model , in particularly in the study of the supersymmetric grand unification theories ( susy guts ) .",
    "this interest was in particular stimulated by the new data due to lep1 and lep1.5 experiments .",
    "if one believes literally in all this data , especially in the @xmath1 measurements , one comes to the conclusion that neither the standard model ( sm ) nor the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) are sufficient to explain the experimental results @xcite .",
    "one naturally has to turn to the other models .",
    "one of the most popular directions in the search for the new physics is the study of susy guts .",
    "unfortunately , one immediately encounters the problem of how to break supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "the most popular way is to use a hidden sector through which susy breaking is transferred to the visible world by means of supergravity ( see e.g. ref.@xcite for a review ) .",
    "recently a new approach to break susy was developed@xcite . in this approach susy",
    "is broken dynamically and the effects of susy breaking are transferred from hidden sector to the visible world by means of gauge interactions .",
    "the natural question is whether one can use this mechanism to construct realistic susy gut theories @xcite .",
    "there are several tools one can use at present to decide whether the gut theory is realistic or not .",
    "one of the most powerful among them is the experimental limit on the proton lifetime .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that simple extension of mimimal su(5 ) susy gut with the mechanism of dynamical susy breaking due to refs .",
    "@xcite leads to the too small lifetime of proton .",
    "consequently , this model is ruled out .",
    "the purpose of this note is to return once again to the analysis of the proton lifetime in the minimal su(5 ) susy gut with dynamical supersymmetry breaking due to dine and nelson , and to include the yukawa couplings in the analysis of ref .",
    "we study the influence of yukawa couplings , both of the 3rd generation and of the hiden sector , on the proton lifetime and masses of the color triplet higgs boson @xmath2 .",
    "we shall see that the inclusion of yukawa couplings increases the proton lifetime but not significantly .",
    "however , the model can not be ruled out at @xmath3 level .",
    "the model is not ruled out in a small window at small @xmath4 if one takes into account the uncertainties in the lep data for @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath7 qed and weak coupling constants at @xmath8 scale .",
    "the note is organised in the following way : first we use renormalization group ( rg ) equations for gauge couplings taking yukawa couplings into account .",
    "we then find the masses of color triplet bosons @xmath2 , depending on @xmath9 ( qcd coupling ) for different values of @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "we then use the formula for proton lifetime from ref.@xcite to find the proton lifetime for different allowed by lep data values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath9 .",
    "our final results are depicted in figs.1 - 6 , thus giving the bounds on the possibility of using mechanism of refs.@xcite to break susy in su(5 ) gut model .",
    "let us briefly describe the model we are going to study ( we refer to the reader to refs.@xcite for details ) .",
    "the model is the mimimal su(5 ) susy gut plus the messenger superpotential @xmath12 here l and d , that carry quantum numbers of sm gauge groups and form together into @xmath13 of su(5 ) , are the messenger lepton and quark chiral superfields added to the model .",
    "s is a scalar chiral superfield singlet under the sm gauge groups .",
    "s transfers the supersymmetry breaking from hidden sector to the fields of the standard model . at the messenger scale @xmath14 tev",
    "the singlet s and its f - component get vacuum expectation values and susy breaks down .",
    "the heavy superfields l and d transfer the information of susy breaking to the fields of sm through their couplings to the sm gauge groups .",
    "the analysis of proton decays in this note is similiar to the work by carone and murayama@xcite .",
    "however , these authors did not take into account the influence of the yukawa couplings on the evolution of gauge couplings .",
    "we use below the rg equations for yukawa couplings that can be derived using ref.@xcite .",
    "first , we evolute the rg equaions from @xmath8 to @xmath15 using the sm @xmath16-functions and then from @xmath15 to @xmath17 ( taken as 100tev ) using the mssm ones . above @xmath17 we take into account the effects of the messenger fields : @xmath18 the evolution of yukawa couplings themselves are taken into account in one loop approximation and are carried out using the following rg equations ( for scales larger than @xmath17 ) : @xmath19 our notations are self - evident : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are yukawa couplings of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 to the corresponding higgs doublets in the miminal su(5 ) susy model . @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the messenger yukawa coupling constants to the singlet s. we proceed then in the same way as in ref .",
    "we use the evolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 to determine the gut scale @xmath26 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 unify into @xmath27 , and then get the mismatch between @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which should be attributed to the gut threshold effects , that are assumed to originate from the color triplet @xmath30 .",
    "we get the mass of the color - triplet higgs @xmath31 from its dependence on the threshold effects ( the detailed formulae can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "once @xmath31 is determined , we use the standard formulae for the proton lifetime(see ref .",
    "@xcite ) to find the partial width and to compare them with the current experimental bounds .    in our numerical evolution , we use the following boundary conditions .",
    "first , we made a standard choice of the masses of @xmath32-quark , @xmath0-lepton and the top - quark as : @xmath33 gev , @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 gev .",
    "we do not depict uncertainties in these boundary conditions due to masses , since their influence on the results is not large .",
    "for the messenger yukawa couplings we take the largest possible values : @xmath36 if we choose the boundary conditions to be given by eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , @xmath24 and @xmath25 unify into a common value at the gut scale .",
    "if inputs larger than those in ( [ 7 ] ) is taken , the messenger yukawa couplings will blow up at the gut scale .",
    "the boundary conditions for gauge couplings are determined from lep data@xcite : @xmath37 for the qcd coupling we use @xmath38 @xcite  the number that incorporates both low energy data and lep1 data .",
    "all the gauge couplings are taken within @xmath3 variations in our estimations .",
    "our main results are depicted in figs . 1 - 6 .",
    "first , we depict the mass of the color - triplet , @xmath31 , as a function of @xmath9 for different @xmath4 .",
    "these results are depicted in fig . 1 - 3 for different values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we take the lowest bound of @xmath4 as 0.85 . below this",
    "bound the yukawa couplings will blow up at the gut scale .",
    "this lowest bound can be achieved only when the yukawa couplings are included in the rg analyses .",
    "we see that for reasonable values of @xmath4 , yukawa couplings of messenger quarks and leptons actually do not influence @xmath31 greatly .",
    "however , when we consider the different values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 within @xmath3 variations , we see that @xmath31 can change quite significantly as a function of @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the most favored @xmath31 is gained when @xmath5 is taken at its upper bound while @xmath6 the lower one .",
    "next , we consider the decay rate of a typical process @xmath39 . this mode was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite to be the most appropriate one in analysing proton decay bound in susy gut .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "we see that the allowed region of @xmath40 and @xmath4 depends on the inputs @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "inclusion of the usual yukawa couplings in rg equations improves the situation with the proton lifetime . on the other hand , inclusion of the messenger yukawa couplings",
    "even worses the situation slightly . as the current experimental bound@xcite of proton decay lifetime",
    "is concerned , the only window where the model survives is the region of small @xmath4 combined with large @xmath5 and small @xmath6 as input .",
    "our general conclusions are that , first , the inclusion of yukawa couplings does not lead to significant changes in the mass of color triplet and the allowed parameter space for the model we consider .",
    "second , the allowed parameter space , color triplet mass and proton lifetime seem to be quite sensitive to exact values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 at @xmath41 scale .",
