    "waveguides for ir light are most often inferior as compared to those for optical or microwave light . in general the lack of excellent transparent solids at ir wavelength calls for hollow - core guidance rather than solid - core guidance relying on total internal reflection ( tir ) .",
    "while presently the latter solution remains attractive for single - mode light guidance usually over a short distance , extension of such ir fiber to high - power light guidance is difficult due to adverse effects including fresnel loss , thermal lensing , and low damage threshold power , etc . without tir ,",
    "hollow - core fibers require a highly - reflective cladding mirror . at the moment , there are mainly two recognized hollow - core ir waveguiding structures , either relying on reflective metal mirrors  @xcite or a dielectric photonic band - gap ( pbg ) material  @xcite which was first explored for optical wavelengths over the past decade  @xcite . unlike at microwave wavelength ,",
    "metals at ir wavelength are less perfectly reflecting mirrors due to the presence of finite ohmic absorption .",
    "hence a direct ir waveguiding using a hollow metallic fiber ( hmf ) does not work well .",
    "the same dilemma exists for the transport of terahertz electromagnetic ( em ) waves , i.e. far - ir light ( refer to @xcite and references therein ) . in practice , it is necessary to further refine the hmf by adding an additional dielectric coating on the metal cladding  @xcite .",
    "photonic band - gap guidance on the other hand remains as a potential solution , but the guiding mechanism is inherently band - gap limited and heavily relies on a highly periodic photonic crystal cladding .",
    "bragg fibers with a 700  @xmath0-diameter core have facilitated hollow - core band - gap guidance of co@xmath1 laser radiation ( @xmath2 ) with a propagation loss of @xmath31  db / m  @xcite .",
    "the state - of - the - art hmf with a dielectric coating with the same core size experiences a similar loss level at this wavelength @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show that metamaterial holds promises for entirely new guiding mechanisms , being of neither photonic band - gap nature nor relying on the classical total - internal reflection !",
    "in fact , the potentials of especially metal - based metamaterial has already been exploited for novel hollow - core planar waveguide @xcite or fiber @xcite designs . in the present work ,",
    "we propose to incorporate metal - wire metamaterial into a cladding mirror design for hollow - core ir guidance .",
    "the hollow guidance mechanism is fundamentally different from previous proposals @xcite in which a metamaterial cladding with an effective refractive index between 0 and 1 is deployed for achieving light confinement , but rather based on the fact that a highly anisotropic medium with difference signs in its effective permittivity tensor components is able to totally reflect transverse - magnetic ( tm ) light .",
    "tm - polarized ligth is previously considered problematic to be propagated in a hollow metallic waveguide , both in slab or fiber geometry , as it suffers significantly higher loss compared to transverse - electric ( te ) light .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , in section 2 we will show why a planar interface between a metal - wire metamaterial and air can serve as a mirror for tm - polarized light at ir frequency .",
    "the condition required for such a total external reflection is stated .",
    "we quantitatively derive the angular reflectance spectrum for a silver - wire medium approximated as a homogeneous medium with a effective medium theory ( emt ) , proving its superior reflection performance at large incidence angles compared to a bulk silver . in section 3 ,",
    "we study hollow - core ir guidance in cylindrical fibers with metal - wire medium as cladding .",
    "the fiber , which converges to the traditional hmf when the fraction of metal increases , has a drastically improved performance over hmf , as we will support by calculations based on both emt as well as more rigorous full - vectorial finite - element simulations accounting for the mesoscopic structure of the metamaterial cladding . in section 4 , we briefly compare how our proposed metamaterial fiber differs with a hmf with a dielectric inner coating .",

    "[ fig : losscore ] , losses for the te@xmath63 and tm@xmath63 modes are respectively 0.07  db / m and 0.52db / m .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the mp@xmath67 mode in a hmf with the same core size experiences a loss of 49  db / m .",
    "it has been a common practice to reduce the propagation loss of a hmf by further imposing a dielectric coating on its inner wall  @xcite . here",
    "we would like to briefly compare the performances between a dielectric - coated hmf and a metamaterial fiber .",
    "since te light sees the metamaterial layer as if it is a dielectric medium , the two fiber types under comparison should be more or less equivalent for guiding te modes .",
    "the major difference lies in their guidance of tm modes . with the materials deployed in previous sections",
    ", we will show that a hmf with a dielectric coating is able to perform slightly better than a metamaterial fiber in guiding tm@xmath63 mode . however , the former has the drawback of being quite sensitive to dielectric coating thickness , which on the other hand also implies its sensitivity to operating wavelength .",
    "let s borrow the same dielectric previously used for the metamaterial host ( @xmath88 ) as the coating for a hmf .",
    "the hmf s outer cladding ( silver ) starts from a fixed value @xmath89 m .",
    "the first cladding interface is located at @xmath90 with @xmath91 the coating thickness .",
    "we examine the propagation loss of the guided tm@xmath63 mode as a function @xmath91 . the result is shown in fig . [ fig : losscompare ] .",
    "when the coating thickness increases from 0 to 6@xmath47 m , the mode loss undergos a periodic variation , with value ranging from 0.275 to over 100@xmath92 .",
    "this periodic change in loss is caused by the resonance and antiresonance of the dielectric layer .",
    "therefore experimentally one has to locate an optimum coating thickness in order for such a fiber to work at a minimum loss  @xcite .",
    "now , if we replace the dielectric coating with a metamaterial one , the periodic variation in modal loss can be suppressed .",
    "this is shown again in fig .",
    "[ fig : losscompare ] by two flat curves , which correspond to two hybrid fibers with different wire separations but with the same metal filling fraction at 20% .",
    "the independence of the tm modal loss to metamaterial coating thickness is an inherent result of the fact that tm waves are evanescent in such metamaterial .",
    "hence practically the hybrid fiber with metamaterial coating might be less sensitive to structural parameters , at least for the tm modes .",
    "we have also explored the possibility to further reduce the tm@xmath63 loss of a hybrid - clad fiber with a third dielectric coating on top of the metamaterial layer . however , the further reduction in loss is not significant .     mode as a function of coating thickness , for a hmf with dielectric inner coating and a hollow - core hybrid fiber incorporating metamaterial.,width=302 ]    we should emphasize that the difference between the two types of fibers is far more complicated than what s been presented by fig .",
    "[ fig : losscompare ] .",
    "for example unlike tm modes , te modes in the hybrid metamaterial fiber should have a periodic loss dependence on the coating thickness .",
    "that is , the two types of fibers have similar performances for guiding te modes .",
    "comparison of the mp modes between two types of fibers would be more intriguing .",
    "since a mp mode comprises both te and tm wave components , such modes in both fibers will be sensitive to their coating thickness .",
    "some difference should however be expected because of their different guidance behaviors for the tm wave components . due to significantly heavier computing resources required for numerically deriving the mp modes ,",
    "an explicit comparison for guidance of mp modes by the two types of fibers is not presented here .",
    "although our presentation has focused on the co@xmath93 wavelength , simulations were also carried out for other fiber structures based on silver and silica materials designed to operate at 1.55@xmath47 m wavelength .",
    "very similar improvement in tm mode guidance for a hybrid - clad metamaterial fiber compared to a metal - clad fiber is noticed .",
    "however , due to inherently huge ohmic absorption of silver at this wavelength , propagation loss for the tm@xmath63 mode in a hybrid - clad fiber , e.g. with a 30@xmath47 m core diameter , though reduced , can still be higher than 100db / m , which is hardly useful for practical applications . hence with commonly accessible materials at disposal , the advantage of the proposed metamaterial fiber only becomes obvious at ir frequencies .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that a metal - wire based metamaterial functions as a tm reflector .",
    "the reflectance from a substrate made of such a metamaterial can be better than that from a plain metal at large incidence angles .",
    "numerical simulations show that a hollow fiber with such a metamaterial cladding can easily propagate a tm mode 100 times farther compared to a simple hmf . with a hybrid - clad fiber which has a thin inner metamaterial cladding and an outer metal cladding",
    ", we can achieve low - loss propagation of modes in all categories .",
    "such a fiber in theory can be as compelling as the state - of - the - art fibers , including the bragg fiber and the more traditional hmf with a dielectric coating , for ir light delivery .",
    "we emphasize that the proposed guiding principle and in turn the fiber structure is within our fabrication capability at least in a foreseeable future .",
    "our study also suggests that innovations in metamaterial technology can open many other possibilities for designing new em waveguides , especially for radiation frequencies previously considered problematic to transport .",
    "this work is supported by the danish council for strategic research through the strategic program for young researchers ( dsf grant 2117 - 05 - 0037 ) .",
    "we derive the material requirement for wave confinement in a cylindrical hollow fiber as specified by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conditiontm ] ) and ( [ eq : conditionte ] ) in the text .",
    "we assume that the material parameters of the cladding have the tensor form as @xmath94 note that any tenor component can be a negative value . to simplify our analysis",
    ", we further assume @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the harmonic dependence is taken as @xmath95 . due to cylindrical symmetry ,",
    "field within the medium is completely characterized by two similar wave equations , one for @xmath96 and the other for @xmath97 .",
    "the @xmath96 wave equation is @xmath98 where @xmath99 . by variable separation @xmath100 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : wavemaster ] ) can be decomposed into two equations .",
    "one of them gives rise to angular dependence of the field as @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is an integer denoting the angular momentum number .",
    "the radial dependence of the field is governed by @xmath103 equation  ( [ eq : waver ] ) is a bessel or modified bessel differential equation , depending on the sign of @xmath104 . for light confinement in a hollow core ,",
    "it is necessary for the field to be evanescent in the cladding while @xmath105 ( as wave should be propagating in the core ) .",
    "subsequently , we find that this condition can be fulfilled when @xmath106 and the corresponding radial eigen - field in the cladding can be written generally in bessel functions as @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "similar analysis can be carried out for the @xmath97 wave equation . and the resulted condition for @xmath97 confinement is @xmath109 the general radial wave solution is the same as eq .",
    "( [ eq : solutionhz ] ) except with @xmath47 changed to @xmath110 .",
    "other field components can be written as a function of @xmath97 and @xmath96 .",
    "therefore once the conditions specified by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : conditionhz ] ) and ( [ eq : conditionez ] ) are fulfilled , confinement of the overall mode can be ensured .",
    "when @xmath111 , the six field components are divided into two unrelated groups giving rise to two types of angularly invariant modes : a te mode group with field components h@xmath21 , e@xmath50 , and h@xmath49 ; and a tm mode group with field components e@xmath21 , h@xmath50 , and e@xmath49 .",
