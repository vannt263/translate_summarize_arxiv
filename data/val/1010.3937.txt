    "it has been shown , recently , that pure hard - rod models in two - dimensions ( 2d ) exhibit discrete orientational order without translational order @xcite , driven by a mechanism resembling that proposed by onsager for the nematic transition of rods in three dimensions @xcite .",
    "specifically , it was proved that a system of rods on the square lattice , with hard - core exclusion and length distribution between 2 and @xmath0 , exhibits discrete orientational long - range order for suitable fugacities and large @xmath0 .",
    "this may seem surprising as the nature of the transition of monodisperse freely rotating rods in 2d remains subtle , as it appears to depend on the details of the particle interactions @xcite .",
    "simple 2d restricted orientation models are relevant to describe the sub - monolayer regime of linear molecules adsorbed on crystalline substrates @xcite and , even without polydispersity , rigid rod ( rr ) models were shown to exhibit a number of interesting features@xcite . it was found that the ordered phase is stable for sufficiently large aspect ratios@xcite and that the transition on the square lattice is 2d ising @xcite .",
    "polydisperse restricted orientation rr models are generalizations of the zwanzig model@xcite , and provide a useful starting point for understanding the effects of polydispersity on the phase behavior of rrs@xcite .",
    "the description of self - assembled rods has to consider not only the effects of polydispersity but also the polymerization process . in this context",
    ", we proposed a model of self - assembled rr ( sarr ) , composed of monomers with two bonding sites that polymerize reversibly into polydisperse chains @xcite . in the ( lattice )",
    "model a site can be either occupied or unoccupied and each occupied site has a spin variable . on the square lattice ,",
    "the spins take two values representing the discretised set of orientations of the bonding sites that coincide with the lattice bonds .",
    "the interaction between two spins depends not only on their relative orientations but also on their orientations relative to the lattice bond connecting the monomers .",
    "we used a simple theory to investigate the interplay between self - assembly and ordering over the full range of temperature and density .",
    "the results revealed that the continuous ordering transition is predicted semiquantitatively by the theory@xcite .",
    "the universality class of this transition was not investigated ; ordering of sarrs was assumed to be that of monodisperse rigid rods , which was found to be 2d ising on this lattice@xcite .",
    "in fact , the transition of polydisperse rrs , on the square lattice , was investigated for a vertex model that allows configurations promoting the polymerization of rods , in such a way that it is equivalent to the hard square model on the diagonal lattice . in polymer language , the ordered phase is stable when the average polymer length is long or its density is high .",
    "calculations of the order - parameter using a variant of the density matrix renormalization group exhibit clear 2d ising exponents ( @xmath1 ) at all densities@xcite . however , in 2009 , lopez et .",
    "al @xcite carried out monte carlo ( mc ) simulations to investigate the critical behavior of the sarr model and concluded that self - assembly affects the nature of the transition , claiming it to be in the q=1 potts class ( random percolation ) , rather than in the 2d ising ( q=2 potts ) .",
    "this is at odds with exact results@xcite that map the polydisperse rr model , with @xmath2 , to the 2d ising model , as well as with the results of the vertex model @xcite referred to above .",
    "apart from its fundamental interest , self - assembly is a very active field of research , driven by the goal of designing new functional materials , inspired by biological processes where it is used routinely to construct robust supramolecular structures . in this context",
    ", the effect of polydispersity on the nature of the ordering transition of a given model is an important open question .    in the following ,",
    "we report the results of a systematic investigation of the criticality of the sarr model over a wide range of temperatures , corresponding to critical densities that decrease from 1.0 ( full lattice ) to 0.1 .",
    "we note that the full lattice sarr model may be mapped to a 2d ising model , while the zero density sarr model exhibits an equilibrium polymerization transition at zero temperature .",
    "the results of our simulations provide strong evidence that the transition remains in the 2d ising class at all ( finite ) densities .",
    "however , the numerical results also suggest that the scaling region is strongly affected by the density , decreasing as the density decreases , in a way that depends both on the scaling variable and on the thermodynamic function under investigation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the model and the simulation methods are described in sec .",
    "the results for 2d ising criticality of the sarr model are reported in section iii . in section",
    "iv we give additional arguments that support our conclusion : ( i ) we map the full lattice limit ( fll ) onto the 2d ising model , ( ii ) we consider the zero density limit and estimate the crossover line from the zero density equilibrium polymerization transition and ( iii ) we discuss the non - monotonic behavior of the internal energy per particle on the critical line .",
    "finally , in section v we summarize our results , and offer an explanation for the q=1 potts behavior observed by lpez et al.@xcite .",
    "the model is the two bonding site model , on the square lattice , proposed in ref .",

    "this is plotted in fig .",

    "a look at table [ table.tc ] reveals that the critical energy per particle , @xmath93 , varies non - monotonically with the temperature . in the self - assembly limit ,",
    "the internal energy @xmath94 is a measure of the average rod length and is predicted to vary monotonically on the critical line , as stated above ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "clearly , a departure from this behavior indicates the importance of the attractions between rods , which are short in the high - temperature regime .",
    "let us assume that there is no bonding ,",
    "i.e. , the temperature is so high that the average rod length is of order 1 .",

    "the results from self - assembly , eq . ( [ intensacl ] ) , are monotonically increasing , while those from the high temperature theory , eq .",
    "( [ mfinternergy ] ) , are monotonically decreasing .",
    "the low density / temperature behavior is captured by the self - assembly theory @xcite while the high density / temperature limit is described by the mean - field theory .",
    "similar remarks apply to the critical line itself , as shown in fig .",
    "[ criticaline ] .",
    "this analysis suggests that although self - assembly fluctuations become increasingly important as the density decreases the nature of the singularity changes at @xmath106 only .",
    "nevertheless , the scaling region decreases rapidly in the low - density / temperature region and the true asymptotic behavior may be difficult to observe in simulations of reasonably sized systems .",
    "the results reported in the previous sections clearly suggest that the critical behavior of the sarr model is 2d ising . this conclusion is supported by ( i ) the scaling behavior of the binder cumulant for different system sizes , ( ii ) the system size dependence of the peaks of @xmath107 and ( iii ) the values of the critical exponent @xmath47 .",
    "this conclusion contrasts with that of lpez et al . , and it is important to understand the reasons for this discrepancy .",
    "first we acknowledge that the values of @xmath77 are relatively similar for the two universality classes ; the same may be said of @xmath78 .",
    "thus the distinction between the two universality classes will have to be based on the value of the @xmath108 crossing and on the value of @xmath47 . in the analysis of lpez et al , the use of the density as the control parameter leads to a value of the @xmath55 crossing that differs substantially from that of the 2d ising universality class .",
    "we have shown that using @xmath35 as the control parameter leads to a more robust scaling of @xmath55 and to a much better overall ising scaling .",
    "concluding that the sarr model is indeed in the ising universality class , the question is then , how was the value of @xmath109 observed when using @xmath91 as the control parameter ?",
    "consider a property @xmath110 whose derivative with respect to the control parameter has a maximum in the critical region .",
    "such derivative scales in the finite size region as@xcite : @xmath111 where @xmath112 represents either the density or the chemical potential . in the scaling region @xmath113 , and @xmath114 are related by : @xmath115 where we used @xmath116 ( q2uc ) and the scaling relation given in eq .",
    "( [ ddq2 ] ) .",
    "we suspect that the presence of @xmath117 in the scaling of @xmath114 , raises the value of the effective critical exponent @xmath47 . in particular , for",
    "the range @xmath118 used by lpez et al .",
    "@xcite the ratio @xmath119 is well described by : @xmath120 , with @xmath121 , close to the value @xmath122 of the q1uc .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.rho_scaling ] where it is clear that the finite - size scaling of @xmath123 is well described using both @xmath124 and @xmath125 as the scaling density .    to conclude , we have shown that the criticality of the sarr model is 2d ising .",
    "nevertheless , as the temperature decreases deviations from the ising scaling laws increase , and larger system sizes are needed to obtain accurate estimates of the critical exponents .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the self - assembly fluctuations that occur closer to the critical line as the density and temperature decrease .",
    "in addition , the use of pbc may enhance this finite - size effect , through the percolation of periodic rods .",
    "finally , we note that milchev and landau @xcite analysed the critical behavior of a flexible self - assembling rod model in 2d .",
    "they report a continuous transition in the @xmath126 space ending at a tricritical point , at finite density , and critical exponents on the continuous portion of the two - phase boundary in the 2d ising class .",
    "their model is richer than ours but the nature of the continuous portion of the phase boundary is likely to be the same .",
    "the connection between these two models as well as extensions to 3d will be left for future work .",
