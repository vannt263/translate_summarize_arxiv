    "with the availability of improved monoenergetic ortho positronium ( ps ) beam , low - energy collision of exotic ortho ps atom with neutral atoms and molecules is of interest in both physics and chemistry due to its vast applicational potential @xcite .",
    "recently , measurements of total ortho - ps scattering cross section from various atomic and molecular targets ( he , ne , ar , h@xmath0 , n@xmath0 , c@xmath5h@xmath6 , and c@xmath7h@xmath8 ) have been carried out at low and medium to high energies @xcite .",
    "experimental investigations are also in progress for the measurement of pick - off annihilation of ortho ps from closed shell atoms @xcite . because of the composite nature and high polarizability of ps ,",
    "a reliable theoretical description of ps scattering is far more complicated than electron scattering @xcite , as excitations and ionization of ps are expected to play a significant role for each target states . besides if the target is vulnerable to excitations , prediction of total cross section becomes extremely difficult as the number of scattering channels grow as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 excited states of both ps and target are considered .",
    "due to internal charge and mass symmetry , ps atom yields zero elastic and even - parity transition potentials in the direct channel and ps scattering is dominated mainly by exchange correlation @xcite .",
    "this eventually complicates the convergence of a conventional coupled - channel description @xcite . for ps scattering with molecular target",
    "we have additional complication due to the presence of the nuclear degrees of freedom .",
    "the presence of three charge centers complicates the solution scheme of the coupled - channel equations .",
    "the degree of complication can be realized from the mathematical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite for ps formation in positron - hydrogen - molecule scattering .",
    "because of mathematical complication , this approach has not been further pursued in numerical analysis and there exists no successful calculation of ps formation in positron - hydrogen - molecule scattering .",
    "we recall that the mathematical complication of a dynamical coupled - channel study of ps formation in positron - hydrogen - molecule scattering is similar to that of ps - h@xmath0 scattering .    here",
    "we undertake a theoretical study of ps scattering by h@xmath0 .",
    "we employ a hybrid approach of treating the molecular orientational dependence as parameters in the coupled equations and then perform the partial - wave expansion @xcite .",
    "the resulting one - dimensional equations are solved at the equilibrium nuclear separation by the matrix - inversion technique and the partial - wave cross sections are numerically averaged over molecular orientations .",
    "the present approach makes the ps - h@xmath0 scattering problem easily tractable .",
    "recently , we suggested a regularized electron - exchange model potential @xcite and demonstrated its effectiveness in exchange - dominated ps scattering by performing quantum coupled - channel calculations using the ab initio framework of close - coupling method for both simple and complex targets @xcite . in our initial calculations",
    "we used a nonsymmetric model - exchange potential for ps scattering by h @xcite , he @xcite and h@xmath0 @xcite and obtained reasonably good agreement with experiment on he and h@xmath0 . in a subsequent application of ps scattering by h , it was found that a time - reversal symmetric form of the exchange potential leads to far superior result than the nonsymmetric form both in qualitative and quantitative agreement with accurate variational calculations on h @xcite .",
    "the symmetric potential also led to very good results for low - energy cross sections for ps scattering by he , ne , and ar @xcite in excellent agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "in view of the above we reinvestigate the problem of ps scattering by h@xmath0 using the symmetric exchange potential employing the three - ps - state [ ps(1s,2s,2p ) ] coupled - channel model for elastic and ps(2s,2p ) excitations .",
    "we solve the coupled - channel equations by the above scheme and report partial cross sections for ps(1s,2s,2p ) excitations .",
    "we also calculate cross sections for ps excitations to @xmath11 states and ps ionization using the first born approximation .",
    "a target - elastic total cross section is calculated by adding the above partial cross sections .",
    "we use the present symmetric exchange potential to calculate the target - inelastic born cross sections for excitation to b @xmath3 and b @xmath4 states of h@xmath0 by ps impact .",
    "we present a total ps - h@xmath0 cross section by adding the above target - elastic and target - inelastic results .",
    "in section 2 we present the theoretical formulation in the body - frame fixed - nuclei approximation . in section 3",
    "we present the numerical results .",
    "finally , in section 4 we present a summary of our findings .",
    "the total wave function @xmath12 of the ps - h@xmath0 system is expanded in terms of the ps and h@xmath0 quantum states as @xmath13\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the coordinate of the positron ( electron ) of the ps atom , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the coordinates of the electrons of h@xmath0 , @xmath20 is the internuclear separation of h@xmath0 , @xmath21 the wave function of ps , @xmath22 the wave function of h@xmath0 , with @xmath23 denoting the electronic configuration of h@xmath0 and @xmath24 denoting the quantum state of ps . here",
    "@xmath25 denotes antisymmetrization with respect to ps- and target - electron coordinates and @xmath26 is the continuum orbital of ps with respect to the target .",
    "the spin of the positron is conserved in this process and the exchange profile of the ps - target system is analogous to the corresponding electron - target system @xcite",
    ".    primary complication arises in the coupled - channel study in retaining both the summations over ps and target states in the coupling scheme . as we shall see later that the contribution of the individual target - inelastic channels to cross section is one order small compared to that of target - elastic channels .",
    "so we exclude the summation over target states from the coupling scheme and treat cross section for target excitations separately using born approximation . in this work",
    "we are mostly interested to see whether the model can accommodate the measured total cross sections of ps - h@xmath0 scattering .",
    "so we retain the ps(1s,2s,2p ) excitations in the coupled - channel model and treat the remaining excitations by born approximation .",
    "the first born calculation with present regularized exchange leads to results reasonably close to coupled - channel calculation at medium energies .",
    "hence it is expected that this calculation should yield a fairly good picture of the total cross section except near the ps - excitation thresholds .",
    "projecting the resultant schrdinger equation on the final ps and target states and averaging over spin , the resulting momentum - space lippmann - schwinger scattering equation in the body - frame representation for a particular total electronic spin state @xmath27 can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the scattering amplitudes , and @xmath30 the corresponding born potentials .",
    "@xmath31 is the on - shell momentum of ps in the intermediate channel @xmath32 .",
    "we use units @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the electronic mass . for ps - h@xmath0 target - elastic scattering",
    "there is only one scattering equation ( [ 1 ] ) corresponding to total electronic spin @xmath35 .",

    ". \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next we describe the electron - exchange model potential for ps - h@xmath0 scattering .",
    "we develop the model exchange potential from the following term @xcite : @xmath53 after removing the nonorthogonality of the initial and final wave functions of ( [ 3 ] ) and some straightforward simplification the model exchange potential for a general target - elastic transition becomes @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the angular momenta of the initial and final ps states and @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 are the parameters of the h@xmath0 and ps wave functions in the initial state .",
    "the parameter @xmath60 corresponds to the final - state binding energy of the ps atom and is taken as zero while considering exchange for the ps ionization channel . for target - inelastic processes , following the prescription outlined in refs .",
    "@xcite the exchange potential takes the form @xmath61 in ( [ 4x ] ) the additional indices @xmath23 and @xmath51 are introduced on the molecular orbitals @xmath62 and @xmath63 to distinguish the initial and final states .",
    "the model exchange potentials ( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 4x ] ) may be considered as a generalization of a similar potential suggested by rudge @xcite for electron - atom scattering .",
    "the nonlocal and time - reversal symmetric exchange potential ( [ 4 ] ) has a very convenient form and is expressed as a product of form factors of ps and h@xmath0 .",
    "both the direct and exchange amplitudes have been factored out in terms of ps and target  form - factors \" leading to a substantial simplification of the theoretical calculation . in our previous study of ps - h@xmath0 scattering",
    "@xcite the prefactor of the exchange potential was not time - reversal symmetric . in eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) we have restored time - reversal symmetry as in ref .",
    "@xcite which is found to provide significant improvement in the results .",
    "although , for electron - molecule scattering several model potentials are found in the literature @xcite , there is no other convenient model exchange potential for ps scattering .",
    "in the body - frame calculation the coupled - channel equations are solved at the equilibrium nuclear separation @xmath64 . the polar and azimuthal angles @xmath65 and @xmath66 of @xmath67 are taken as parameters in the coupled equations @xcite .",
    "this reduces ( [ 1 ] ) to the following form @xmath68 after standard partial - wave projection the three - dimensional coupled scattering equations ( [ 7 ] ) are first reduced to coupled one - dimensional integral equations in momentum space .",
    "the one - dimensional equations are then discretized by gauss - legendre quadrature rule and solved by the matrix inversion technique .",
    "a maximum of forty points are used in the discretization of the integrals .",
    "the discretized coupled - channel equations are solved for eight to ten discrete values each of polar and azimuthal angles @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "this leads to a convergence of cross sections up to three significant figures . for targets with more charge asymmetry and for polar molecules",
    "we expect that more points will be required for angular averaging .",
    "the present averaging amounts to solving the coupled set of scattering equations sixty four to hundred times .",
    "although this procedure increases the computational ( cpu ) time , mathematical complications of tedious ( and untractable ) angular - momentum analysis @xcite are thus replaced by a tractable and convenient calculational scheme .",
    "finally , the partial - wave cross sections are numerically averaged over molecular orientation using gauss - legendre quadrature points for both polar and azimuthal angles @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "maximum number of partial waves included in the calculation is 12 .",
    "contribution of higher partial waves to cross section is included by corresponding born terms .",
    "these born cross sections are also numerically averaged over all molecular orientations in a similar fashion .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the angle - integrated target - elastic cross sections for elastic , ps(2s+2p ) , ps(@xmath69 ) excitations and ionization of ps .",
    "as expected and observed in previous calculations @xcite with other targets , the contribution of the ps ionization channel to the cross section plays a dominant role from medium to high energies as can be seen in figure 1 .",

    "we have considered only two lowest target - inelastic processes and their combined effect on the total cross section .",

    "this trend was also found in our calculation of ps - he scattering @xcite . in the energy range of 7 to 15 ev",
    ", the total cross section overestimates the measured data .",
    "this is due to the fact that ps(@xmath72 ) excitations and ionization have been treated in the first born approximation framework .",
    "the neglect of other target - inelastic channels and the first born calculation for higher excitations and , in particular , ionization of ps are supposed to be responsible for the shift in the theoretical peak . a dynamical calculation for higher",
    "ps excitations and ionization should reduce the theoretical total cross section in the intermediate energy region , while the inclusion of further target - inelastic channels will increase the cross section for medium to higher energies .",
    "these two effects are expected to shift the peak in the total cross section to higher energies and lead to a better agreement with experiment .    a previous first born description of ps - h@xmath0 scattering @xcite with born - oppenheimer exchange @xcite led to unphysically large cross section at low energies",
    ". the poor performance of that scheme in ps scattering compared to electron scattering is due to the fact that in the absence of the direct potential ( zero for elastic scattering ) , the born - oppenheimer exchange potential solely determines the cross section .",
    "this clearly shows the very unrealistic nature of the born - oppenheimer exchange potential at low energies .    in previous studies @xcite of ps",
    "scattering we introduced a parameter @xmath80 in the exchange potential for obtaining a more quantitative fit with experiment essentially by replacing the denominator term in ( [ 4 ] ) by @xmath81 in the original form the constant @xmath82 and we have used this value in this study .",
    "however , it can be varied slightly from unity to obtain a precise fit of a low - energy scattering observable ( experimental or variational ) , as has been done in some applications of model potentials @xcite .",
    "a variation of @xmath80 from unity leads to a variation of the average values for square of momenta @xcite , which were taken as the binding energy parameters ( @xmath83 etc . ) in the expression for the denominator in ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "this variation , in turn , tunes the strength of the exchange potential at low energies . at high energies",
    "this model potential is insensitive to this parametrization and leads to the well - known born - oppenheimer form of exchange @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have used a time - reversal symmetric form of the nonlocal model potential for exchange and applied it to the study of ps - h@xmath0 scattering .",
    "we have also presented a simplified prescription for performing coupled - channel dynamical scattering calculation with molecular target using a body - frame fixed - nuclei scheme . with this prescription",
