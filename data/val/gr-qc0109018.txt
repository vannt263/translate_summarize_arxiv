    "one of the most promising sources of gravitational radiation currently under investigation is the collision and coalescence of binary pairs of black holes of comparable mass @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of such systems in the regime corresponding to large separation , where the interaction is weak , appears to be adequately described in terms of post - newtonian approximations @xcite . at sufficiently close separation , where the interaction becomes strong , the system is expected to go through a `` plunge '' phase , eventually leading to the formation of a common horizon , after which the system behaves as a perturbed black hole that settles to a final stationary state . at this latest stage , `` close approximation '' perturbative method have proved capable of providing reliable information on waveforms and related quantities @xcite .",
    "however , up to the present , no equally successful methods have been found that can handle the intermediate strong field regime , although some speculations have been presented , based mainly on extrapolations between the early and very late regimes .",
    "the fact that these methods may not reveal effects that may be unique to the strong field stage of binary interactions has been recently pointed out by price and whelan @xcite , in relation with the effect of tidal interactions in binary black hole inspiral , in the case where the black holes have moderately to large angular momentum .",
    "one of the particular close limit regimes considered in @xcite , that in which the black holes have equal , parallel spins , pointing in the same direction and perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the black holes , had not been analyzed in detail previously in the literature @xcite , and therefore only rough estimates are given there . in this paper",
    "we provide that analysis by considering the collision of two slowly rotating , initially non boosted , black holes in the close limit .",
    "the black holes have equal masses and equal parallel spins aligned perpendicular to the line joining initially the centers of the black holes .",
    "the expression `` initially non boosted '' refers to the manner in which the initial data is constructed . in our case",
    "we consider initial data obtained by the `` puncture''@xcite modification of the bowen - york ansatz @xcite .",
    "mostly for simplicity , we include angular , but not linear , momentum in the conformal extrinsic curvature . in the close limit considered here , this represents a perturbed , non axially symmetric , state of a ( slowly ) rotating black hole , and therefore it is natural to apply the regge - wheeler - zerilli @xcite,@xcite black hole perturbation theory to analyze its evolution .",
    "however , as we show in this paper , even with the above simplifications the evolution equations for a part of the leading contributions are linear , but not homogenous , and require formulating the problem in second order perturbation theory @xcite , for a problem with more than one perturbation parameter .",
    "the corresponding evolution equations contain `` source '' terms , and their influence on the asymptotic behavior of the solutions , which contains the information on the gravitational waves , needs careful evaluation .",
    "since these expressions had not been given in the literature before , this paper contains the details of construction of the initial data and the evolution equations , together with the corresponding expressions for the gravitational wave amplitudes , and radiated energy , in terms of ( gauge invariant ) regge - wheeler - zerilli functions .    in the close limit",
    "the system analyzed here bears a marked resemblance with the `` pseudoinspiral problem '' considered in @xcite , @xcite , where the binary black hole system has orbital , but no spin angular momentum .",
    "this resemblance stems from the fact that in the close limit , once a single horizon has been formed , both systems behave as distorted black hole settling to a final kerr form , with the distortion dominated by quadrupolar terms .",
    "since the systems lack axial symmetry , it is expected in both cases that the gravitational waves will carry also radiation of angular momentum .",
    "this expectation was confirmed by the computations carried out in @xcite , @xcite for the `` pseudoinspiral case '' .",
    "since only linear perturbation theory is required in that case , the computations were done both in the regge - wheeler - zerilli and the teukolsky formalism @xcite .",
    "however , it was rather surprisingly found that although the radiated energy computed in both formalism showed a reasonable agreement , this did not happen for the predicted radiation of angular momentum .",
    "in fact , except for very small values of the angular momentum , the teukolsky formalism , as applied in @xcite , @xcite , leads to the rather disturbing result that the angular momentum increases as a result of the radiation ( the angular momentum radiated has opposite sign to that of the system ) .",
    "this is not the case for the prediction given by the regge - wheeler formalism .",
    "although the detailed reasons for this discrepancy are not clearly understood , it is the opinion of the present authors that it may be due mainly to the rather large departure of the initial data from that of a kerr black hole . since the system considered in this paper has initial data that is closer to that of a kerr black hole , in the sense that the perturbations are of second order in the angular momentum parameter , rather than first order as in the case of @xcite , @xcite , one of the main purposes of our analysis was to compute the angular momentum radiated in the process , as the disturbed black hole settles to its final kerr form , and its eventual comparison with the corresponding teukolsky results .",
    "as is shown in this paper , within the regge - wheeler - zerilli formalism , this , as well as the computation of the leading wave forms and radiated energy , requires an extension of the theory to second order , ( in fact , to even higher order , if we derive the expression for the radiated angular momentum as indicated in section vii ) , which is explicitly given here .",
    "it should be clear that at this point that the alternative treatment be based on the teukolsky formalism , and , possibly , its extension to second order @xcite , is a task requiring as much extension as the one reported here .",
    "for this reason , that development , and its comparison with the results obtained with the regge - wheeler formalism presented here , will be considered in a separate paper , currently under development .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we consider the construction of the initial data .",
    "this is naturally given in a `` misner '' type gauge .",
    "however , as we indicate , this gauge is not appropriate for a perturbative computation , and we derive the gauge transformation to , and the form of the initial data in a `` boyer - lindquist - kerr '' type of gauge for the @xmath0 , odd parity perturbations , where these have a very simple coordinate dependence .",
    "we then consider the evolution of the second order perturbations in the regge - wheeler gauge , and obtain the corresponding zerilli , and regge - wheeler functions and equations .",
    "we describe their asymptotic behavior , their relation to the corresponding gravitational wave amplitudes , and derive the expressions for the radiated power and energy .",
    "finally , we obtain an expression for the radiated angular momentum directly using perturbation theory , in terms of the zerilli functions for the perturbations .",
    "comments and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "in applications of the regge - wheeler - zerilli black hole perturbation theory one considers a family of metrics , depending on one or a few parameters , such that the schwarzschild metric is recovered when the parameters are set equal to zero .",
    "the problem may be analyzed as an initial value problem , so that the specification of the members of the family amounts to identifying the corresponding initial data on a certain three dimensional hypersurface .",
    "actually , since the computations are carried out in a coordinate patch that covers only the region outside the black hole horizon , one requires expansions of the initial that may be convergent only in that region .",
    "examples are furnished by the families of initial data constructed via the `` conformal approach '' @xcite to the initial value problem in general relativity . in this approach",
    "one assumes that the three - metric @xmath1 is conformally flat , i.e. @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is some non vanishing function , and @xmath4 a flat three - metric , and defines a conformal extrinsic curvature @xmath5 .",
    "then , assuming maximal slicing @xmath6 , the initial value constraint ( for a vacuum metric ) are reduced to , @xmath7 where all derivatives are with respect to the flat metric . in general , the conditions , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a radial coordinate on the fiducial flat space where @xmath10 is defined , are imposed on @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , on the initial slice , asymptotically , for large @xmath9 we have @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "this fact is important because one can find exact solutions to the momentum constraint ( [ momentum ] ) , and , using ( [ asymp01 ] ) , obtain a ( partial ) physical interpretation of the associated spacetime in terms of adm observables , without solving ( [ hamiltonian ] ) explicitly .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the solution @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , with @xmath16 cartesian coordinates on the flat space background , and @xmath17 is a constant vector , is considered .",
    "then , taking spherical polar coordinates for the flat background , so that @xmath18 one straightforwardly identifies @xmath19 with the angular momentum of the system , irrespective of the detailed knowledge of @xmath3 . in the application given in @xcite , the conditions ( [ asymp01 ] )",
    "are supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions for @xmath3 , so that the resulting initial data is identified with that of a single spinning black hole ( in a non stationary initial state ) , centered at the origin of the flat coordinate system .",
    "in this paper we consider the initial data that results from taking @xmath20 as the sum of two terms of the form ( [ k_one ] ) , symmetrically centered around the coordinate origin , with the same @xmath19 . in the cartesian coordinate system associated with the flat background , we have , @xmath21 \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   { 3 \\over \\rho^3_2 } \\left [   \\epsilon_{acd } s^c n_2^d n_{2\\;b } +   n_{2\\;a } \\epsilon_{bcd } s^c n_2^d   \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we also take @xmath26 .",
    "this may be thought of as the ( conformal ) extrinsic curvature corresponding to two black holes with equal angular momentum @xmath27 , pointing along the @xmath28-axis , placed at the points @xmath29 .",
    "actually , this interpretation requires that @xmath3 has a singularity structure in accordance with that of ( [ k_two ] ) .",
    "this may be achieved in different ways . here",
    "we take the `` punctures '' ansatz @xcite , namely , we assume that @xmath3 is of the form , @xmath30 where , @xmath31 that is , @xmath32 is taken as the brill - lindquist conformal factor @xcite , and we impose that @xmath33 must be regular in the whole conformal plane , and vanish for large @xmath34 . in accordance with this prescription , @xmath33 satisfies the equation , @xmath35 with @xmath36 given by ( [ k_two ] ) , which , for @xmath37 , may only be solved numerically .",
    "we notice , however , that for @xmath38 we should have @xmath39 , and , from the form ( [ punkt3 ] ) , we expect that @xmath33 admits an expansion in powers of @xmath40 , near @xmath38",
    ". moreover , when @xmath41 , @xmath32 approaches the conformal factor for a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "therefore , the ansatz ( [ k_two ] ) , together with ( [ punkt1 ] ) , and ( [ punkt2 ] ) , lead to a two - parameter family of initial data , with the schwarzschild metric as the limit when the parameters vanish . in the slow , close approximation approach of this paper",
    "we consider the situation when the two holes are initially so close to each other that a single horizon is formed , and the system , from the point of view external to the horizon , may be considered as a perturbed single black hole . in this situation ,",
    "the external field admits a multipolar expansion , and the multipolar order turns out to be correlated with different powers of the parameters , so that , by keeping the lowest orders in the parameters , we end up with a few multipolar terms , and this is expected to provide a good approximation to the exact initial data , and its evolution .",
    "there is always a certain degree of arbitrariness in the choice of perturbation parameters .",
    "here we notice that , because of the conditions imposed on @xmath3 , the initial data corresponds to a system with adm angular momentum @xmath42 .",
    "we shall therefore consider @xmath43 , and @xmath44 as expansion parameters . in the limit @xmath45 , @xmath46 , the conformal factor",
    "@xmath3 corresponds to that of a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath47 . in what follows",
    "we write all expressions in terms of @xmath48 , rather than @xmath49 .",
    "we recall that in the regge - wheeler black hole perturbation theory the analysis is restricted to the region outside the horizon . to construct our perturbative initial data we start by considering ( [ punkt3 ] ) , but restricted to the region @xmath50 . if we expand @xmath51 in powers of @xmath52 , and keep only lowest orders , we find ,    @xmath53    this implies , keeping again only the lowest contributing order , @xmath54    similarly , we expand @xmath32 , @xmath55    a simple power counting shows that the lowest order in @xmath33 is @xmath56 , if we consider @xmath56 and @xmath57 of the same order . to this order ( [ punkt3 ] )",
    "reduces to , @xmath58    the solution of this equation is , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a standard spherical harmonic , and , @xmath61    we must set @xmath62 , to have the correct asymptotic behavior . the constants @xmath63 , and @xmath64 are fixed so that @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are regular for @xmath67 .",
    "this , for our perturbative expansion , is a consequence of the regularity conditions imposed on @xmath33 within the `` punctures '' ansatz @xcite .",
    "see also the discussion given in @xcite , for the analogous case of `` boosted '' black hole collisions .",
    "the final result is ,    @xmath68    this completes our perturbative computation of the conformal factor and extrinsic curvature . to construct the initial data for the evolution equations",
    ", we recall that if we fix the shift functions @xmath69 , we have @xmath70 where for @xmath71 we identify @xmath1 , and @xmath72 with those obtained above .",
    "we next change from the conformal radial coordinate @xmath9 to a schwarzschild radial coordinate @xmath73 , such that @xmath74 , and choose @xmath75 , so that we recover the schwarzschild metric , with mass @xmath48 , for @xmath76 .",
    "the final results , in the standard regge - wheeler multipolar decomposition and notation @xcite ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite , for more details ) are listed below .",
    "notice , however , that we indicate the odd parity perturbation components with @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , instead of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , as in @xcite to avoid the explicit use of `` odd '' and `` even '' labels .",
    "the metric components obtained using the procedure just described may be written as follows ,      @xmath84      @xmath86    @xmath87    @xmath88    @xmath89      @xmath91      @xmath93      the extrinsic curvature components may be written in the form ,      @xmath94      @xmath96      @xmath98    where we are using our modified regge - wheeler notation , and a @xmath99 at the beginning of each function indicates that we have a multipolar component of the extrinsic curvature , instead of one of the metric .",
    "if we consider the initial data for the @xmath0 , odd , perturbation , we find that if we set @xmath100 , consistent with setting the shifts to zero , the evolution equations have the solution , @xmath101    this in turn leads to solutions for the other amplitudes that grow in time",
    ". for our calculations it will be more convenient to choose a gauge where , @xmath102    the gauge transformation required to produce this change is first order in @xmath43 , for the @xmath0 , odd parity terms , and introduces changes in the remaining terms of order @xmath56 , and @xmath103 .",
    "a simple computation , using second order perturbation theory , as given e.g. in @xcite , shows that for the @xmath95 , even parity , order @xmath56 terms , the initial data resulting from this change is the same as for the initial gauge except that now we have , @xmath104    similarly , the transformation induces changes in the @xmath95 , even parity , order @xmath103 terms . in this case , these correspond to first order perturbation , because the terms are linear in @xmath43 .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that the expressions derived previously are replaced by , @xmath105 where we now have a non vanishing shift term ( @xmath106 ) , and the data not explicitly indicated is zero .    finally , the gauge transformation equations for the @xmath97 , @xmath107 , odd parity perturbations take the form , @xmath108 \\nonumber \\\\ \\widetilde{k1}_{3,0 } & = & { k1}_{3,0 } -{6 t \\over \\sqrt{35 } r^2 } \\left[k^{l^2}_{2,0 } -2 g^{l^2}_{2,0 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\widetilde{k2}_{3,0 } & = & k2_{3,0 }    \\nonumber \\\\ \\widetilde{k0}_{3,\\pm 2 } & = & { 2 \\sqrt{7 } \\over 21 r } \\left[k^{l^2}_{2,\\pm 2 } -2 g^{l^2}_{2,\\pm 2 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\widetilde{k1}_{3,\\pm 2 } & = & { k1}_{3,\\pm 2 } -{2 t \\over \\sqrt{7 } r^2 } \\left[k^{l^2}_{2,\\pm 2 } -2 g^{l^2}_{2,\\pm 2 } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ \\widetilde{k2}_{3,\\pm 2 } & = & k2_{3,\\pm 2 } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath109 , @xmath110 are the even parity , order @xmath57 , regge - wheeler functions in the bowen - york gauge . in general , if necessary , in this paper we shall use a superindex @xmath57 , or @xmath111 , to make explicit the order of the terms .",
    "the above equations may be used to give explicit expressions for the initial data in terms of @xmath73 .",
    "we shall not display them here .",
    "the time evolution of the initial data we have just constructed may be handled as follows .",
    "first we notice that the initial data depends on two parameters : @xmath43,and @xmath44 .",
    "actually , only even powers of @xmath44 appear .",
    "this implies that , in a regge - wheeler type of expansion , terms of order @xmath43 , or of order @xmath57 satisfy linear perturbation equation",

    "d ) terms of order @xmath103 .",
    "these are actually higher order in perturbation theory . since terms of order @xmath43 have @xmath0 , and are of odd parity , and terms of order @xmath57 have @xmath95 , and are of even parity , in principle , they may contribute `` sources '' for terms of order @xmath103 , and @xmath114 , with both even and odd parity .",
    "however , an analysis of the form of the corresponding einstein equations shows that the perturbations corresponding to @xmath115 , with even parity , and @xmath85 with odd parity , obey linear homogeneous equations .",
    "since the initial data for these terms vanishes , they vanish for all times . of the remaining terms , those with @xmath0 odd parity",
    "do not contribute to the radiation , and therefore , shall not be considered in what follows . in the next subsections we obtain and display the relevant equation for the evolution of the terms contributing to the radiation of angular momentum and energy , up to the orders considered .",
    "this implies , in some cases , that we shall have to extend previous results on the application of black hole perturbation theory in the regge - wheeler - zerilli framework",
    ". these will be indicated where appropriate .",
    "in this case we have to consider terms of even parity with @xmath95 , and @xmath116 .",
    "the reality of the metric implies that the amplitudes with @xmath117 are the complex conjugate of the corresponding amplitude with @xmath118 , so we need to consider only one of these .",
    "since all these perturbations obey first order equations , in the regge - wheeler gauge they may be uniquely written in terms of the zerilli functions @xmath119 , @xmath120 , in the form @xcite ,    @xmath121    the zerilli functions @xmath119 are given in a general gauge by the moncrief @xcite expression , @xmath122 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + { r^2 \\over ( 2r+3 m ) } \\left[{k}_{2 , \\,m}+(r-2 m ) \\left ( { \\partial { g}_{2 , \\,m }    \\over \\partial r } - { 2 \\over r^2 } { h1}_{2 , \\,m}\\right ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and obey the equation , @xmath123 where , @xmath124 these functions are directly related to the gravitational wave amplitudes .",

    "this is immediately obtained from the knowledge of the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding zerilli functions .",
    "proceeding as indicated in @xcite , we obtain , @xmath129 where the functions @xmath130 may be written uniquely in terms of a single function @xmath131 in the form @xmath132 @xmath133 where @xmath134 , and the functions @xmath131 are determined by the initial data , through the evolution equations .    the relation between the functions @xmath135 and the gravitational wave amplitudes results from their gauge invariance . in an asymptotically flat gauge we find that , for large @xmath73 , and @xmath136 , we have @xmath137 where @xmath138 implies equality up to terms of order @xmath139 .",

    "formally , these are of second order , since we are considering both @xmath43 , and @xmath57 as first order , and they satisfy linear inhomogeneous equations , with source terms bilinear in the order @xmath43 , and order @xmath57 terms .",
    "now , given any solution of these equations , together with those of order @xmath43 , and @xmath57 , it is always possible to perform first a first order gauge transformation that takes the order @xmath43 ( @xmath0 , odd parity ) terms to a standard form , that we have taken as the boyer - lindquist - kerr form , given in section iii , and the order @xmath57 ( @xmath95 , even parity ) terms , to the standard regge - wheeler gauge , where one may write the regge - wheeler gauge functions uniquely in terms of the zerilli function , @xmath159 , ( as in ( [ ele2l2 ] ) ) , and the order @xmath57 einstein equation are satisfied if @xmath159 satisfies the zerilli equation .",

    "therefore , solving ( [ rw32 ] we find the gravitational wave amplitude for this mode .",
    "the foregoing construction gives the complete solution of the perturbative einstein equations for the mode considered .",
    "for computational purposes , however , if one is interested only in finding the radiated energy and wave forms , it is simpler to notice that , after fixing the gauge for the order @xmath43 ( `` kerr '' gauge ) , and for the order @xmath57 ( regge - whheler gauge ) perturbations , in a general gauge for the order @xmath103 perturbations , the function , @xmath191\\ ] ] satisfies the inhomogeneous regge - wheeler equation , @xmath192\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    asymptotically for large @xmath73 , and @xmath136 , @xmath193 admits the expansion , @xmath194    we remark that , after fixing the gauges for the lower order perturbations , @xmath195 is gauge invariant under transformations of order @xmath103 . in particular , in an asymptotically flat gauge for these perturbations we have , @xmath196 and , therefore , @xmath197 where @xmath138 implies equality up to terms that decrease as @xmath151 for large @xmath73 .",

    "the lowest order in the radiation of angular momentum comes from the interference of the @xmath95 , @xmath231 , even parity , outgoing waves of order @xmath57 , with those of order @xmath103 , giving a contribution of order @xmath232 .",
    "we may obtain the expression for the radiated angular momentum using the formulas in @xcite .",
    "this implies , however , that we need to obtain the asymptotic transverse traceless gauge amplitudes , which implies a rather lengthy computation .",
    "we may instead use the fact that the following expression , @xmath233\\ ] ] where @xmath234 , and @xmath235 represent the corresponding regge - wheeler coefficients in an asymptotic expansion of the metric for large @xmath73 , corresponds , for @xmath71 , and to leading order , to the ( adm ) angular momentum on the initial hypersurface .",
    "it is clear that @xmath236 , defined by ( [ angular1 ] ) is time dependent .",
    "since @xmath237 represents the initial value of the angular momentum of the system , we should consider @xmath238 , as the final value of the angular momentum , after the system has settled to its final kerr black hole .",

    "rather lengthy calculation shows that , we have , @xmath244 = { \\cal{s}}^{(i)}\\ ] ] where @xmath245 is a ` source ' , that depends on the lower order perturbations .",
    "we then have , @xmath246 dt\\ ] ]    one can show that the net contribution from @xmath247 vanishes .",
    "then , the leading contribution to @xmath240 comes from @xmath248 . from einstein s equations we find that @xmath248 is bilinear in the @xmath95,@xmath204 , order @xmath57 and order @xmath103 contributions . writing these perturbations in the regge - wheeler gauge , and using the expansions of the previous section",
    ", a straightforward computation shows that , @xmath249 dt\\ ] ]    using now the results of the numerical evolution , we finally find , @xmath250    this result implies that less than 0.3% of the total angular momentum will radiated even in the extreme case @xmath251 .",
    "it is in good agreement with the corresponding result found in @xcite for the `` pseudo - inspiral '' case .",
    "in this paper we have numerically evolved a particular set of initial data , and obtained quantitative expressions for the radiated energy and angular momentum , for a system of two equal mass rotating black holes , in the close limit .",
    "if we analyze in more detail the expression for the radiated energy , we find that a large contribution comes from the order @xmath56 amplitude .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the initial data for rotating black holes obtained with the bowen and york prescription , even for a single black hole @xcite , contains a fair amount of `` spurious '' radiation that must be radiated away before the system can settle to the final kerr form .",
    "one might then expect that they would be absent , or make a much less significant contribution if the evolution started with initial data closer to that of a kerr black hole . on the other hand",
    ", it seems reasonable to assume that the contributions of the terms of order @xmath57 , and @xmath103 should be much less dependent on the form of the initial data , since for order @xmath57 they are independent of spin , and for order @xmath103 they require the order @xmath43 data , and this is `` exactly '' of the kerr form .",
    "it is precisely these terms that provide the leading contribution to the radiated angular momentum .",
    "this contribution is such as to decrease the angular momentum of the system .",
    "the radiation may therefore be considered as providing a `` torque '' somewhat in the manner envisioned in @xcite .",
