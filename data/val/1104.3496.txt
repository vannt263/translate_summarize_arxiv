    "the lee - wick standard model ( lwsm )  @xcite is a recent proposal to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "the model is based on ideas of lee and wick  @xcite which were originally conceived for qed regularization in the late 60 s . in the most simple picture ,",
    "the lwsm key feature consists in adding a lee - wick ( lw ) partner for each standard model ( sm ) field , but with larger mass and wrong sign kinetic term .",
    "henceforth , without modifying the low energy phenomenology , partial cancellations in loop corrections eliminate quadratic divergences in the higgs mass .",
    "one of the main controversies in the lee - wick ideas is , at the same time , one of the most challenging and attractive points of the theory : the lw - partners fields seem to violate microscopic causality . despite the alarm this statement may provoke at a first glance",
    ", the theory has remained robust during these last years . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the theory respects macroscopic causality , since lw resonances are only intermediate unstable states and therefore the resulting theory is unitary at least at tree level  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proved that a @xmath1 lee - wick theory is unitary at all orders  @xcite , and it has also been shown that violation of microscopic causality does not imply any paradox as far as this violation is microscopic enough  @xcite .",
    "it is fair also to recall at this point that there has never been found any inconsistency in the original lee - wick ideas , but , instead , they lost the due attention because of the seminal paper of t hooft and veltman which finally solved the regularization and renormalization of gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "several phenomenological and theoretical aspects of the lwsm have been studied in the last few years  @xcite .",
    "in particular , electroweak precision measurements @xcite force the lw gauge bosons and quark masses ( assuming minimal flavor violation ) to be around a few tev .",
    "the lw leptons are only constrained by direct detection through pair production , and thus the bound is about @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the scalar sector of the theory has been indirectly constrained in a practical and efficient article by carone and primulando @xcite . in this paper",
    "the authors obtain bounds on the lw higgs sector through the one - loop contributions of higgs bosons to processes such as @xmath3-meson mixing , @xmath4 and @xmath5 . despite being",
    "formally one - loop suppressed , these kind of observables are enhanced by large yukawa couplings and are very well measured .",
    "their combined analysis yields a bound to the non sm - like lee - wick higgs scale of around @xmath6 gev .    in this article , as a complement of the indirect analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we study the constraints to the lw higgs sector arising from direct searches at lep , tevatron and lhc .",
    "although this work achieves better present bounds than the indirect study only in a minor part of the phase space , it settles the perspectives for direct detection of the lw higgs sector .",
    "moreover , we show that after lhc run i , the non sm - like higgs parameter space should be mostly probed up to the tev scale , which will improve considerably the present indirect limits .    on a first step ,",
    "we implement the present collider direct constraints from lep and tevatron with the help of the code @xcite , and study the exclusion of the parameter space .",
    "this computer code allows to analyze simultaneously several lep and tevatron direct search signals and choose the best one to constrain a given point in parameter space at a @xmath7 c.l . .",
    "in a second step , we include the exclusion projections from the atlas collaboration , finding that the lhc with a center - of - mass energy of 7 tev and an integrated luminosity of 5 @xmath8 ( expected to be achieved by the end of 2012 ) would be able to probe most of the parameter space for the lightest higgs mass .",
    "we also focus on the heavy higgs bosons , showing the prospect for their detectability at the lhc run i.    this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : intro ] we review the lwsm higgs sector , focusing on the couplings and relevant branching fractions of the higgs bosons . we summarize and analyze the input needed to run . in section  [ sec : num ] we obtain the main direct bounds to the higgs sector coming from lep and tevatron signal analysis .",
    "afterwards , we study the lhc perspectives for direct search in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channels .",
    "section  [ sec : conclu ] contains our conclusions and final remarks .",
    "in this section we write down and discuss the lwsm higgs sector in the physical basis and compute all the collider - relevant effective couplings which involve scalars .",
    "these effective couplings are used in next section to constrain the parameter space of the model using all the suitable results from lep and tevatron with the aid of .      as mentioned in the introduction",
    ", the lw lagrangian can be written in two equivalent ways .",
    "one of them introduces none additional fields , but involves higher derivatives ( hd ) which give additional degrees of freedom to the theory .",
    "the other one introduces the new degrees of freedom explicitly as new partner fields for each sm field .",
    "this second formulation the lw picture is more clear in dealing with collider experiments , since the contribution of these new fields to the processes can be understood in terms of the usual feynman diagrams . along this work",
    "the lw formulation will be employed .",
    "we now focus on the lwsm higgs sector lagrangian .",
    "( the lagrangian and details of the full lwsm can be found elsewhere @xcite . )",
    "given the stringent bounds on the lw gauge bosons , @xmath11 tev , and the quark masses @xmath12 tev found in previous electroweak precision tests studies @xcite , and given the relatively loose bounds on the charged higgs , @xmath13 gev , coming from @xmath14 bounds @xcite , it is suitable to decouple from the theory the lw gauge bosons and quarks and to keep only the lw scalars . notice that although the lw leptons can not be constrained from ewpt and their only mass limit comes from direct search , @xmath15 gev @xcite , they can be safely decoupled due to their tiny yukawa couplings to the higgs sector .",
    "we may also neglect mixing between sm and lw leptons . within these assumptions",
    "the lwsm higgs sector reads before symmetry breaking and in the flavor basis , [ eq : lag ] l_higgs & = & ( d _ h)^d^ h - ( d _ ) ^d^ + m^2 ^ - v ( h- ) + + & & ( g_u^ij |u^i_r ( h - h ) q^j_l - g_d^ij |d^i_r ( h^-h^ ) q^j_l - g_e^ij    @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the @xmath18 doublets for the @xmath19 family of quarks and leptons , respectively , and @xmath20 the corresponding yukawa coupling before diagonalization . since we have decoupled the lw gauge bosons from the theory , @xmath21 is the usual sm @xmath22 covariant derivative .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath23 corresponds to a two - higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) which is different from the usually found in the literature , mainly due to the opposite sign in the kinetic terms of the second higgs .",
    "notice also that contrary to the usual type i and type ii models , here both higgs bosons couple to all fermions .",
    "however , as first observed in ref .",
    "@xcite , after electroweak symmetry breaking it is possible and useful to identify some pieces of this 2hdm lagrangian with the mssm model for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the diagonalization to the physical basis is driven in two steps after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "first , one diagonalizes the scalar fields in the quadratic part of the kinetic plus potential lagrangian ( first line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) ) , and second , the fermion basis is diagonalized in the yukawa interactions ( second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) ) .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is understood as usual through the higgs potential ( last two terms in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) ) . in this case",
    ", the minimization conditions forbid @xmath25 to acquire a vacuum expectation value , leaving the usual sm relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the vacuum expectation value of @xmath28 .",
    "the expressions for the electroweak gauge boson masses are exactly the same as in the sm . in the unitary gauge one can write h= (    c 0 + v+h    ) , = (    c ^+ + + i    ) .",
    "the spectrum consists of five higgs fields : two neutral cp - even higgs , ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , one neutral cp - odd higgs @xmath31 and two charged bosons , @xmath32 .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking one can diagonalize the scalar sector . the neutral cp - even bosons mix with each other via a symplectic transformation [ eq : eigenstates ] (    c h +    ) = (    cc & + &    ) (    c h_0 + _ 0    ) , where the subscript @xmath33 is reserved for the mass eigenstates .",
    "the mass eigenvalues are given by m^2_h_0,_0= ( 1 ) .",
    "and the mixing angle factors by = , = , r . at tree level , both @xmath31 and @xmath32 are degenerate in mass , and the following sum rule holds [ eq : mhsumrule ] m^2_h_0 + m^2__0=m^2 _ = m^2_^=m^2 .",
    "note that the model implies the following hierarchy in the spectrum : @xmath34 .    in order to diagonalize the yukawa interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) , since we have decoupled lw fermions , the usual sm rotation in the quark fields shall be performed .",
    "henceforth , the resulting yukawa fermion - scalars interacting lagrangian may be divided in a neutral scalar and charged scalar lagrangian .",
    "the neutral scalar lagrangian is as the usual sm lagrangian replacing [ eq : replace ] hh-(h + i p ) .",
    "the charged scalar lagrangian for the quark fields is [ eq : lhpmff ] l_^f |f = , where @xmath35 is the sm ckm matrix and @xmath36 are the diagonal mass matrices .",
    "notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq : lhpmff ] ) is up to an overall minus sign , since @xmath32 comes from @xmath37 doublet , the same result that one obtains in a general type ii 2hdm for @xmath38 . to obtain the physical basis interaction @xmath29 and @xmath39",
    "shall be rotated to their physical counterparts @xmath40 and @xmath41 through eq .",
    "( [ eq : eigenstates ] ) .",
    "having diagonalized the higgs sector we now write down the relevant effective couplings of these scalars to fermions , to gauge bosons , and between them .",
    "the customary notation is such that @xmath42 denotes the effective coupling of any higgs boson @xmath43 to the fields specified in the string @xmath44 , normalized to the sm case for neutral higgs bosons , and to charged would - be goldstone bosons for the charged higgs .",
    "if the process does not have an analog in the sm , then the normalization will be defined in each case .      when the kinetic and potential terms ( first line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lag ] ) ) are rotated to the physical basis , gauge bosons to scalar and trilinear scalar couplings , among others , show up .",
    "we first turn our attention to the interactions between scalars and gauge bosons .",
    "since quartic interactions are not relevant for the lhc collider phenomenology , we are left to consider trilinear couplings .",
    "one has to keep in mind that in the interaction basis only @xmath28 is able to couple to a vector boson pair since @xmath45 . using @xmath46",
    ", one gets that the ratio of the lwsm coupling to the usual sm coupling is @xmath47 the two other relevant interaction are @xmath48 and @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a cp - even higgs boson .",
    "they come entirely from @xmath37 , and therefore one gets [ eq : hhv ] g_h_0 z = g_h_0 ^ w^ = - , g__0 z= g__0 ^ w^= - , where , in the absence of a sm reference process , we have normalized to @xmath51 . given the hierarchy of the mass spectrum , the only kinematically allowed decay modes involving these couplings are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the corresponding decay widths read ( v x ) = g^2_x v ^3/2 ( m_x , m_v , m _ ) , where the kinematic factor @xmath54 is given by [ eq : lamj ] ( m_1,m_2,m_3 ) = ( m_1 ^ 2+m_2 ^ 2-m_3 ^ 2)^2 - 4 m_1 ^ 2 m_2 ^ 2 . and",

    "for the trilinear higgs interactions , all the couplings depend only on the single factor @xmath58 the final expression for the absolute trilinear coupling of three generic higgs bosons @xmath59 is given by [ eq : hhh ] g_xyz = - c g_x f |f g_y f |f g_z f |f , where @xmath60 if there are charged higgs bosons , @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 , @xmath64 for all other cases , and @xmath65 are given below . the ckm matrix shall be set to unity in this formula .",

    "quartic higgs interactions are not relevant for collider phenomenology .",
    "the yukawa couplings for the neutral higgs are easily derived by performing the replacement of eq .",

    "one gets @xmath70    in the charged yukawa interactions the most relevant coupling occurs in the third generation where the new channel @xmath71 opens for the top quark decay in case of a light higgs . neglecting the bottom mass ,",
    "the width for this decay is ( t ^+ b ) = m_t^3 ( 1-)^2 .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to compute the relevant information concerning the loop - mediated effective couplings of lee - wick higgs bosons to two gluons , two photons , and a photon and a @xmath72 .",
    "effective couplings of @xmath40 to gluons and photons were already presented in @xcite .    * _ effective coupling of higgs and two gluons _ + the gluonic case is straightforward , because it involves a single diagram : the triangle fermion loop .",
    "since we are decoupling the lw top quark and the other fermions may be ignored due to their suppressed yukawa coupling , the only fermion we keep in the loop is the top .",
    "therefore , the only modification with respect to the sm case is simply the change in the top yukawa coupling , which can be read from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hff ] ) . hence , @xmath73 . + for @xmath31 the loop function for fermions is different with respect to the one for cp - even higgs bosons ( see appendix [ app : loopfunc ] ) due to the cp - odd nature of @xmath31 .",

    "finally , the charged higgs loop contribution will include the @xmath83 function , an extra factor of @xmath84 , and the @xmath85 coupling .",
    "this yields @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "notice that since @xmath90 then only the top loop contributes to the numerator of the @xmath91 coupling .",
    "our expression for @xmath92 agrees with the ones in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "* _ effective coupling of higgs to z and photon _ + the last of the loop - mediated interactions is the decay of a neutral higgs boson into a photon and a @xmath72 boson .",
    "the corresponding mssm formulae can be found in appendix c. of ref .",
    "since this process can be obtained simply by replacing a photon by a @xmath72 boson with respect to the @xmath10 channel , from our previous discussion one already knows all the required relative factors .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the presence of the @xmath72 yields rather cumbersome expressions which read g_x z = . again ,",
    "notice that for @xmath93 only the top loop contributes in the numerator .",
    "in this section we analyze some qualitative features of the lwsm higgs sector above presented in order to understand how the different higgs bosons will face the direct searches performed by lep and tevatron .",
    "this analytic discussion is complemented by the quantitative numeric analysis performed in next sections by the implementation of 2.1.0 .    as a first step it is interesting to plot ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1]a ) the relative couplings @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( which is equal to @xmath96 ) as a function of their only variable , @xmath97 . both @xmath98 and @xmath99",

    "in particular , this implies that the lep @xmath100 bound on the sm higgs would also apply to @xmath40 , as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "the effective couplings are @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .    at this point",
    ", it is worth noticing an important peculiarity of the lw higgs sector : the sum rule for the gauge boson couplings to cp - even higgs is g_h_0 vv^2 - g__0 vv^2 = 1 , while the general 2hdm result involves a @xmath116 sign .",
    "this means that in the lw model _ both _",
    "cp - even higgs bosons can have sizable couplings to the gauge bosons ( and even be larger than one ) , in contrast with the most general 2hdm result . in the limit @xmath104 , the lw higgs doublet @xmath37 decouples",
    "hence , it is not a surprise to see that , in this region , the @xmath40 couplings tend to the sm value , while @xmath117 is gaugephobic .",
    "another interesting point to note is that the following inequality holds [ eq : effcouphierarchy ] g_h_0gg^2 > g^2_h_0 vv > g^2 _ vv .",
    "this result has a strong implication for hadron - collider phenomenology . at the tevatron and the lhc",

    "given that the gluon fusion mode has the largest cross section , this implies that the effective - gluon coupling squared is actually an upper bound for the enhancement factor of the _ total _ production cross section .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1]b we show the relative effective coupling of the cp - odd lw higgs to gluons as a function of @xmath108 .",

    ", we would like to stress that since the one - loop corrections to the production and decay of the sm higgs boson , due to the higgs boson itself , are known to be very small , and these corrections are not much different to those in the lwsm within the approximations used in this work , we expect our tree expressions to hold with sufficient accuracy at higher orders .",
    "in this section we use the above results in order to run the computer code ( hb ) to confront the lwsm higgs sector against the available lep and tevatron data on higgs search .",
    "the code hb , roughly speaking , uses the information from the previous section to compute , for each point in parameter space , the lwsm cross - section of the different higgs search signal topologies .",

    "since hb works under the narrow width approximation , there are two requirements to be fulfilled by the points in parameter space to be tested . on one hand , all higgs bosons mass and width shall fulfill the narrow width approximation , which technically limits its applicability to higgs bosons not heavier than @xmath157 .",
    "this upper value , which is the highest value quoted in the experimental mc studies of both atlas and cms , gives a width to mass ratio @xmath158 . on the other hand , in order to have the signals disentangled , the higgs bosons have to be separated in mass much more than the maximum of their width . in the lwsm",

    "[ fig : htovv ] it can be seen that , with @xmath205 of data , the @xmath9 channel would already be able to exclude most of the points , except for bosons with masses above @xmath214 , or below @xmath215 .",

    "for an integrated luminosity of 5 fb@xmath216 , one probes masses larger than 122 gev , while in the optimistic scenario of 10 fb @xmath216 the exclusion extends to @xmath171 masses .",
    "the @xmath171 limitation is simply due to the fact that both cms @xcite and atlas @xcite cut off the analysis of these channels at 120 gev .",
    "however , the recent update of atlas for the sm higgs boson sensitivities @xcite , where different channels are combined , reports that a total luminosity of @xmath217 is required in order to exclude a 115 gev sm higgs .",
    "therefore it is rather likely , that a combination of all possible channels ( and maybe also a combination of both collaborations ) would be able to fully test the lightest lw higgs boson at the lhc run i , even without assuming the optimistic 10 fb@xmath216 scenario .",
    "now we briefly comment on the prospects for the other lw higgs bosons . in increasing order of its masses ,",
    "the next boson is @xmath117 .",
    "since , as we stated before , this boson is gaugephobic , and its mass is above the top pair production threshold ( due to the masses sum rule ) , we find the @xmath218 channel to be its main decay mode with a branching fraction always higher than @xmath193 .",
    "the second decay mode is actually the @xmath69 , whose branching fraction varies , roughly speaking , in the @xmath219 % range .",
    "this provides a very interesting decay mode of either four fermions , or two fermions plus two photons ; however this signature will only be at the reach of lhc with very high luminosities ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "as for the remaining higgs bosons , we find that the charged higgs decays into top - bottom with a ratio larger than 0.95 .",
    "together with the @xmath220 channel , they comprise the two observable decay channels of the charged higgs , since all the others have branching fractions below @xmath221 .",
    "the cp - odd higss @xmath31 decays predominantly into tops ; the @xmath222 channel account for , at most , @xmath223 , and the gluon - gluon and @xmath224 channels account for a 1 % and 0.1 % of the decays , respectively .",
    "it is therefore evident that to directly probe these heavy higgs bosons at the lhc high luminosities are required : these channels also appear in the mssm , and typical studies are done with , at least , 30 fb@xmath216 @xcite .    to summarize this subsection",
    ", we have found that the lightest lw higgs boson can be excluded at the lhc run i , while the existence of other higgs bosons can not be directly probed .",
    "if a lw higgs signal is seen at run i , it will look like a sm higgs : a very high luminosity would be required to rule out the sm case , and it might indeed not be enough@xcite . if the measure of the @xmath9 channel is higher than the sm cases , then one expects the remaining higgs bosons to be not too heavy .",
    "if the @xmath9 channel measurement is compatible with the sm higgs , then that could mean that the remaining lw higgs bosons are heavier .",
    "in either case , one would still need to directly probe the other higgs bosons .",
    "we have also found that the decay modes of the heavy higgs bosons is rather restricted , mainly due to the hierarchy in the higgs spectrum that does not allow , for instance , one of the heavier higgs bosons to decay into another one plus a gauge boson ( interesting decays like @xmath225 , or @xmath226 are kinematically forbidden ) .",
    "in this work we have studied the bounds on the lw higgs sector coming from direct searches at both the lep and tevatron collider , using the code .",
    "we have also analyzed the prospects for direct detection at the lhc run i. this work complements the study of the indirect constraints performed by carone and primulando  @xcite and settles down the state of the art and perspectives for direct search of lw higgs bosons in colliders .    while direct collider searches place strong constraints mostly on @xmath145 , the observables considered in ref .",
    "@xcite are mostly sensitive to the loop contribution of the charged higgs boson .",
    "these indirect constraints rule out a great portion of the parameter space ( @xmath227 ) , while we have shown that the current tevatron result is only able to constraint a small region of parameter space .",

    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "if @xmath162 is not too heavy ( @xmath229 ) then the exclusion for @xmath145 extends to the @xmath230 .",
    "however , by the same token , as soon as the lhc starts to probe a wider range of masses for @xmath40 , the exclusion will become stronger , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : htovv ] : already with @xmath205 of data @xmath40 masses between @xmath231 and @xmath232 can be ruled out .    in this model ,",
    "all the production modes of @xmath40 are always enhanced with respect to the sm , and also its branching fraction into fermions .",
    "conversely , the decay modes involving gauge bosons ( @xmath233 ) are always reduced with respect to the sm case . when analyzing the rates for the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channel , we have found that in the @xmath9 channel one always obtains an enhancement of the total rate , ( it can go up to 50 % for @xmath234 ) , while in the photon channel suffers a slight reduction ( at most , 5 % ) in the interesting light mass range ( @xmath235 , and it can be enhanced by at most 4 % , for heavier masses .",
    "the magnitude of these two enhancements provides important messages . on one hand",
    ", the @xmath9 channel enhancement means that the lhc will be able to test a wider range of masses for @xmath40 than for the sm higgs . with only @xmath205 of data",
    ", it would be already able to probe a significant portion of parameter space , which can be further extended into the lighter mass region with increased luminosity .",
    "taking into account the current projections for the sm higgs , one can state that the @xmath40 can be fully probed by the lhc run i. moreover , if @xmath40 is not too light , the lhc run ii ( around @xmath213 of data ) will be able to tell apart the lw scenario from the sm .",
    "the mild variation ( with respect to the sm ) of the @xmath10 channel does also have phenomenological implications for lhc run i. on one side , this channel alone is not a discovery channel for lhc run i , not even if a total integrated luminosity of @xmath236 ( optimistic scenario ) were to be achieved .",
    "moreover , the lhc run ii will not be able to use the diphoton channel to tell apart @xmath40 from the sm higgs .",
    "one important feature of the lw higgs sector , is the fact that both cp - even higgs bosons can couple stronger to the @xmath81 and @xmath72 than the sm higgs .",
    "while this is a very appealing possibility , we have also shown that , in its minimal realization , this scenario does not occur . however",
    ", a non - minimal lw higgs sector might be able to accommodate this interesting phenomenological possibility .",
    "as for the remaining higgs bosons , the main decay channel is @xmath237 ( top bottom ) for the neutral ( charged ) bosons .",
    "however , for the heavy cp - even higgs , the detection through @xmath238 constitutes a promising channel , and it might be worth fully exploring the consequences of this decay mode .",
    "similar higgs chain decays modes do not occur with a substantial rate , mainly due to kinematically closure of these channels , due to the strict hierarchy in the higgs spectrum .",

    "<S> the resulting theory is a two - higgs doublet model where the second doublet has wrong - sign kinetic and mass terms . </S>",
    "<S> we include the bounds coming from direct higgs searches at both lep and tevatron using the code , and show the currently excluded parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we also analyze the prospects of lhc run - i , finding that with a total integrated luminosity of @xmath0 and a center - of - mass energy of 7 tev , most of the parameter space for the sm - like cp - even higgs will be probed .    </S>",
