    ", @xmath4 plays an important role in our understanding of the properties of galaxies , galaxy evolution , and galaxy formation .",
    "the connection between @xmath4 and galaxy formation is through the primordial density fluctuation spectrum , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is wavenumber .",
    "if the universe consisted only of weakly interacting particles ( `` cold dark matter '' ) , then the mass function of `` halos '' would be determined solely by @xmath7 , and could be computed using a simple physical recipe for the gravitational clustering and merging of halos ( press & schechter 1974 ) .",
    "however , it is the baryons , rather than the dark matter , that we observe directly ; hence the luminosity function @xmath4 depends on gas physics and radiation processes ( cooling , radiative transfer , star formation , energy input from supernovae , to name just a few ) .",
    "it follows that the luminosity function is sensitive not only to the fluctuation spectrum @xmath8 , but also to the detailed history of galaxy formation and evolution in different environments .",
    "generally the luminosity function of galaxies is parametrized by a schechter ( 1976 ) function ,    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a characteristic luminosity defining the transition between a power - law at faint magnitudes and an exponential cutoff at bright magnitudes .",
    "[ further information concerning the schechter function can be found in felten ( 1985 ) . ]",
    "@xmath10 corresponds roughly to the brightness of the milky way . for a cdm fluctuation spectrum with @xmath11 , the power - law exponent @xmath2",
    "is theoretically predicted to be @xmath12 on the scale of galaxies ( bardeen 1986 ) , though this result is very sensitive to the detailed physical processes involved in the calculation ( babul and ferguson 1996 , frenk 1996 , kauffmann 1998 ) .    what is known empirically about the shape of the luminosity distribution in the nearby universe",
    "? values of @xmath2 in the range @xmath130.7 to @xmath131.0 have been obtained for bright galaxies within 23 magnitudes of @xmath10 ( loveday 1992 ; marzke 1994 @xmath14 ; lin 1996 ) , with a hint of a turnup in the lf at magnitudes fainter than about @xmath15 in the work of lin _ et al._. the field luminosity distribution derived from the ssrs2 redshift survey ( marzke 1998 ) indicates a relatively flat value of @xmath16 for e / s0 s ( including dwarf spheroidals ) and spirals , and a steep @xmath17 value for dwarf irregulars and peculiars ; this steepening of the lf for late - type star forming systems also appears in the work of bromley ( 1998 ) , who subdivided the las campanas redshift survey according to emission - line strength .",
    "ct ( 1998 ) have found a very steep ( @xmath18 ) luminosity distribution for nearby h  i - rich low surface brightness galaxies , and schneider , spitzak , & rosenberg ( 1998 ) find a steep upturn in the h  i mass function for low mass objects ( m@xmath19 m@xmath20 ) .    turning to other environments , loveday ( 1997 )",
    "finds that the luminosity distribution of dwarf galaxies surrounding luminous ( @xmath21 ) galaxies is steep : this can be interpreted either as a turnup in a supposedly universal field luminosity distribution , or alternately as an enhanced probability that dwarfs form in the vicinity of luminous , massive galaxies .",
    "galaxies in groups exhibit a slope @xmath22 ( muriel , valotto & lambas 1998 ) .",
    "there is evidence that compact group luminosity distributions can not be fitted by a single schechter function ( hunsberger , charlton & zaritsky 1998 ) , but instead show @xmath23 at the bright end and @xmath24 below @xmath25 .",
    "there is also some indication that cluster lf s must be fitted with multiple schechter functions ( trentham 1998@xmath26 , lopez - cruz 1997 ) , with a steep upturn at faint magnitudes ( trentham 1998@xmath27 ; phillipps 1998@xmath26 ) .",
    "phillipps ( 1998@xmath27 ) suggest the existence of an environmental dependence of dwarf - to - giant ratio ( @xmath2 ) in clusters .",
    "the faintest galaxies in the steep luminosity distribution population in clusters are , based on their colors ( trentham 1998@xmath14 ) , dwarf spheroidals , whereas in the field they appear to be gas - rich dwarf irregulars ( marzke 1998 ) .",
    "( it should , however , be noted that the marzke dir / peculiar sample is drawn from a small local volume and comprises only 4% of the total ssrs2 sample . )    on the basis of the discussion given above , it appears that the simple paradigm of a universal schechter function ( that fits the lf of galaxies in all environments ) is now untenable .",
    "there is growing evidence that the lf is not a simple schechter function , that it depends on environment , and that it also depends on galaxy morphological class and/or gas content within a given environment .",
    "no clear physical picture has emerged that would allow one to understand current observational evidence on the shape and environmental dependence of the lf .",
    "the local group represents a unique opportunity for the study of the luminosity distribution in relatively low density environments .",
    "the manner in which faint local group galaxies are detected is completely different from that for other groups ( because most local group galaxies are easily resolved into stars ) ; hence surface brightness selection effects operate differently in the local group than they do in more distant groups .",
    "subtraction of foreground and background contaminating objects is irrelevant for local group galaxies , something that is of course not the case for more distant clusters .",
    "the numbers of galaxies in poor groups are so low that it has usually been possible to study only the _ composite _ lf of poor groups ( rather than the lf of any group individually )  here the local group again is an exception .",
    "furthermore , the census of local group members extends to considerably fainter absolute magnitudes ( @xmath28 ) than do any other samples for which the luminosity distribution has been measured ( though incompleteness must be severe at the faint end ) .",
    "thus a study of the local group luminosity distribution is of considerable importance .",
    "what is known about the local group luminosity distribution ?",
    "tully ( 1988 ) derived a composite luminosity function for six nearby groups ( including the local group ) , and found @xmath29 .",
    "van den bergh ( 1992 ) demonstrated that the integral luminosity function of the local group was consistent with @xmath30 , but did not rule out the possibility that other values of @xmath2 fitted the data equally well .",
    "more recently , mateo ( 1998 ) has shown that the lf of galaxies in the vicinity of the local group ( but extending out beyond the usually accepted lg boundary of r = 1 mpc ) is consistent with that derived for poor groups ( ferguson and sandage 1991 ) . again",
    ", this statement does not preclude the possibility that other luminosity distributions fit equally well .    over the past few years",
    "substantial additional data have been accumulated on local group membership and absolute magnitudes , and so the time seems ripe for a fresh , and more detailed , attack on the problem of the local group luminosity distribution .",
    "the local group of galaxies was first decribed by hubble ( 1936 ) in his book _ the realm of the nebulae_. he listed m  31 , m  32 , m  33 , the magellanic clouds , ngc  205 , ngc  6822 , and ic  1613 as probable members of the small group of galaxies associated with our milky way system . inspection of the prints of the palomar sky survey ( van den bergh 1962 ) shows that a large fraction of all of galaxies occur in small groups and clusters that resemble the local group .",
    "this shows that our galaxy is located in a rather typical region of space .",
    "since hubble s pioneering work the number of galaxies that are known to belong to the local group has increased by 4 or 5 per decade to over thirty .",
    "a listing of data on presently known local group members ( van den bergh 2000 ) is given in table 1 .",
    "selection of local group members proceeded in three steps .",
    "first galaxies with distances from the local group centroid ( courteau and van den bergh 1999 ) less than or about 1.5  mpc were regarded as suspected group members .",
    "secondly it was required that local group members should lie close to the relation between between radial velocity v@xmath31 and cos @xmath32 for well - established local group members , where @xmath32 is the distance from the solar apex ( courteau and van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "finally , local group members should not appear to be associated with groups of galaxies that are centered well beyond the limits of the local group .",
    "on the basis of these criteria van den bergh ( 1994 , 2000 ) concluded that the following objects should be excluded from local group membership : ( 1 ) uks  2323 - 326 , ( 2 ) maffei  1 and its companions , ( 3 ) ugc  a86 , ( 4 ) ngc  1560 , ( 5 ) ngc  1569 , ( 6 ) ngc  5237 , ( 7 ) ddo  187 , ( 8) cassiopeia  1 , and ( 9 ) ngc  55 . a particularly strong concentration of these local group suspects , which includes ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 8) listed above , occurs in the direction of the ic  342/maffei group ( krismer , tully & gioia 1995 ) .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 9 ) appear in the direction of the sculptor ( = south polar ) group ; in the case of ( 9 ) , jergen , freeman & binggeli ( 1998 ) find d=@xmath33 kpc , which gives a distance 1.65 mpc from the local group centroid . finally , the discovery of a cepheid ( tolstoy et al .",
    "1995 ) in ddo  155 ( = gr  8) suggests that this object is located at a distance of 2.2 mpc , which places it well beyond the usually accepted limits of the local group .",
    "dohm - palmer ( 1998 ) obtain a similar distance to ddo  155 from the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "also excluded from local group membership are the galaxies ngc  3109 , antlia , sextans  a and sextans  b. these objects , which are located relatively close together on the sky , all have distances of 1.3  1.5 mpc from the milky way , and , of more relevance , distances of @xmath34  mpc from the local group centroid .",
    "furthermore , these objects possess a mean radial velocity of @xmath35 km s@xmath36 relative to the relation between @xmath37 and cos @xmath32 for well - established local group members ( van den bergh 1999 ) .",
    "this suggests that these galaxies form a small group just beyond the zero velocity surface of the local group .",
    "( this surface is at a distance @xmath38 mpc from the local group centroid [ courteau and van den bergh 1999 ] . )",
    "how does the local group membership defined above compare with that of mateo ( 1998 ) ?",
    "the principal differences are that the mateo catalog does not contain several recently - discovered satellites of m  31 , but does include nine objects beyond 1 mpc ( ngc  55 , egb  0427 + 63 , sextans a , sextans b , ngc  3109 , antlia , gr  8 , ic  5152 , uks  2323 - 326 ) . most of these were discussed above .",
    "egb  0427 + 63 has a distance of 2.2 mpc ( karachentsev , tikhonov & sazonova 1994 ) and thus lies well outside the local group . from a color - magnitude diagram ,",
    "zijlstra & minniti ( 1999 ) find that ic  5152 has a distance from the milky way of @xmath39 mpc , a result that agrees with the cepheid distance of 1.6 mpc ( caldwell & schommer 1988 ) ; the distance of this galaxy from the local group centroid is therefore 1.8 mpc , again beyond the local group .",
    "a more detailed discussion of local group membership and of the outer boundary of the local group can be found in van den bergh ( 2000 ) .",
    "because local group galaxies are situated so nearby it is possible to study their luminosity distribution down to very faint absolute magnitudes . nevertheless these data are , no doubt , still quite incomplete for m@xmath40 .",
    "this is shown most clearly by the fact that only one galaxy fainter than this limit has so far been discovered in the andromeda subgroup of the local group , whereas five such faint objects are presently known in the milky way subgroup of the local group . on the other hand , a survey of a twenty thousand square degree area at high galactic latitudes by irwin ( 1994 ) resulted in the discovery of only a single new local group member . furthermore , no new optically visible local group galaxies have turned up in the survey of compact high latitude high velocity clouds ( braun and burton 1999 ) .",
    "taken at face value these results might be taken to suggest that the luminosity distribution of the local group no longer increases below @xmath41 .",
    "it is noted in passing that very large low surface brightness galaxies in the local group , like those that have been discovered in the virgo cluster ( impey , bothun & malin 1988 ) , in the fornax cluster ( bothun , impey & malin 1991 ) and in the m  81 group ( caldwell et al .",
    "1998 ) , may have also eluded us .",
    "the data in table 1 can be used to study the luminosity distribution of local group galaxies .",
    "histograms plotting this distribution are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the upper histogram clearly shows an increased number of objects at faint absolute magnitudes .",
    "the separation by morphological type ( lower two panels ) shows that most of this increase is due to galaxies that are dwarf spheroidals .    a somewhat smoother visual impression of the local group luminosity distribution may be obtained by plotting the _ cumulative _ luminosity distribution , which is compared in figure 2 to several different cumulative schechter functions . in fig .",
    "2 , the cumulative numbers are normalized at m@xmath42=@xmath1310 because it is unlikely that the data are complete at fainter magnitudes .",
    "this figure shows that a schechter function with @xmath43 and m@xmath44 is an acceptable fit to the data ( van den bergh 1992 , mateo 1998 ) , and that there is some evidence for a steepening to @xmath45 at faint magnitudes .",
    "( because of incompleteness effects , this is an upper limit on the faint - end slope ) .    to parametrize the luminosity distribution of the local group ,",
    "we fit the data from table 1 to a schechter ( 1976 ) function [ eqn .",
    "( 1 ) ] . as discussed in  1 , this function possesses a power - law luminosity dependence with exponent @xmath2 , and an exponential cut - off at l@xmath46l@xmath47 . in a plot of log @xmath48(m ) vs. absolute magnitude m ,",
    "the faint end of the schechter function is linear , with slope @xmath49 . in detail",
    ", we fit the unbinned local group absolute magnitude data to a schechter function using maximum likelihood techniques .",
    "the small number of objects involved dictates that we use a poisson , rather than gaussian , estimator of likelihood .",
    "the very small population of luminous galaxies ( @xmath50 ) also means that it is not possible to obtain a robust estimation of m@xmath51 ; hence we fit only @xmath2 ( and of course a normalization constant proportional to @xmath52 ) , with a few different trial values of m@xmath51 ( which make virtually _ no _ difference to the fitted value of @xmath2 ) .",
    "the sparsenesss of the dataset furthermore prevents us from considering luminosity distributions that are a combination of two or more fitting functions ( as found for coma and other rich clusters by trentham 1998@xmath27 ; see also ferguson and sandage 1991 ; binggeli , sandage and tammann 1987 ) .",
    "however , as will be seen , it is nevertheless possible to constrain such functions by isolating different magnitude ranges .    the maximum likelihood program was tested with artificial data sets drawn from a distribution of absolute magnitudes that followed a schechter function . from thousands of simulations ,",
    "the maximum likelihood program was found to return almost precisely the input value of @xmath2 in the mean , even for very small numbers of objects ( n @xmath53 10 ) .",
    "furthermore , the error estimates ( see below ) were also found to be accurate .",
    "table 2 gives the maximum likelihood value of @xmath2 for various fits to the local group data ( different magnitude ranges , and selections of morphological types ) , together with several different error estimators for this quantity .",
    "the first error estimate is simply a @xmath54 error : this is derived by finding that region of the maximum likelihood probability distribution that is centred on the fitted value of @xmath2 , and that includes 68% of the probability .",
    "also given in table 2 are 95% and 99% confidence limits for the upper bound on @xmath2 ( the values of @xmath2 for which the probability is 95% and 99% that @xmath2 is steeper than this ) .",
    "finally , table 2 also shows the percentage probability that @xmath2 is steeper than ( less than ) 1.3 .",
    "considering the entire data set ( faint limit @xmath55 ) , it is apparent that a value @xmath56 is a best fit , with a 95% probability that @xmath57 .",
    "since the local group luminosity distribution is known to be incomplete at such faint magnitudes , we instead consider limiting the choice of objects at the faint end .",
    "however , regardless of the choice of parameters , the value @xmath58 emerges . the probability that @xmath2 is steeper than 1.3 is @xmath59% .",
    "the only exception to this is for galaxies fainter than @xmath60 ; for such objects slopes as steep as @xmath61 are derived . however : ( 1 ) these slopes have large errors ( @xmath62 or even greater ) because they are based both on small numbers of objects , and also on a limited range of @xmath0 ; ( 2 ) the 95% probability upper limit for @xmath2 ( lower limit on steepness ) continues to hover around @xmath63 , and the probability that @xmath45 is only 85% ; and ( 3 ) the effect goes away if one instead considers objects brighter than @xmath64 .",
    "thus we consider this apparent steepening of the luminosity distribution at faint absolute magnitudes to be tantalizing , but _ not _ proven .",
    "note that the derived slope is not very sensitive to the precise value of the faint cutoff for the fit .",
    "this is probably because of incompleteness at the faint end , but also because , even with a faint end upturn in the luminosity distribution , the majority of objects contributing to the fit are at brighter magnitudes .",
    "the derived value of the slope @xmath2 is not sensitive to the assumed outer boundary of the local group .",
    "relative to the local group centroid , the shell between 1.18 mpc ( the zero velocity surface according to courteau and van den bergh 1999 ) and 1.6  mpc contains only a single galaxy , sagdig .",
    "removing this galaxy from our sample does not alter any of the results above .",
    "mateo ( 1998 ) includes nine galaxies in his local group catalog that , because of their distance , do not appear in our catalog ( see section 2 ) .",
    "including these nine objects in our fits makes @xmath2 less steep by @xmath65 .",
    "it should be noted that even this small effect can be entirely explained by incompleteness at the low luminosity end of the sample of galaxies beyond 1.18 mpc .",
    "we also stress that the available evidence does _ not _ support the inclusion of these nine galaxies in our local group catalog ( see discussion in section 2 ) .",
    "most of the apparent steepening in @xmath2 for faint objects is due to the dwarf spheroidals in the local group , as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 . fitting a power - law slope to these objects alone shows a steeper value of @xmath2 than for the entire dataset , but again the effect is only marginally significant . from a kolmogorov - smirnov two - sample test ,",
    "the difference between the luminosity distributions of dir s and dsph s is significant only at the 90% level .",
    "unfortunately , the observations of m81 group dwarfs ( van driel 1998 ) do not enable us to throw additional light on this problem .",
    "this is because these authors were not able to determine morphological classes for the two faintest magnitude bins in their survey .",
    "trentham ( 1998@xmath66 ) has derived a composite luminosity function for galaxies in clusters , and has shown that it can be applied to galaxies in the field as well .",
    "the cumulative form of this empirical luminosity function ( for which @xmath2 steepens towards fainter @xmath0 ) is plotted as the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 . a kolmogorov - smirnov test excludes the possibility that local group galaxies are drawn from this parent population at @xmath67% probability .",
    "finally , we have compared the distribution of @xmath68 magnitudes of galaxies in the m  81 group ( van driel 1998 ) with the luminosity distribution of m@xmath42 of local group galaxies , under the assumptions that ( m - m)@xmath69 and @xmath70 for the m  81 galaxies . from a comparison between the ( presumably more - or - less complete ) data on galaxies with m@xmath42 brighter than 10 and @xmath68 brighter than 17.5 , a kolmogorov - smirnov test shows no significant difference between the m  81 ( n=38 ) and local group luminosity distributions ( n=27 ) .",
    "this suggests that the local group and m  81 lfs are broadly similar , and are drawn from similar parent populations .",
    "a schechter function with @xmath71 provides a good fit to new data for the luminosity distribution of the local group .",
    "this result is in agreement with the luminosity distribution found for poor groups ( ferguson and sandage 1991 , muriel 1998 ) , and is probably consistent with the work of hunsberger ( 1998 ) , who found @xmath72 for @xmath73 and @xmath131.2 for @xmath74 .",
    "our result is comparable to various determinations of @xmath2 in the field ( loveday 1992 ; marzke 1994 @xmath14 ; lin 1996 ; marzke 1998 ) , and is insensitive to the manner in which the local group is defined .",
    "there is evidence for a steepening in @xmath2 below m@xmath42=@xmath1315 ; as discussed in  1 , this effect has been observed in other environments .",
    "however , the steepening of the field luminosity distribution observed by marzke ( 1998 ) is in the dir population , in contrast to the situation in the local group , for which the dir population possesses a flat @xmath75 , and for which the dsph population appears to be possess steeper @xmath2 ( though this difference is significant only at the @xmath76% level in our work ) .",
    "the steepening in @xmath2 that we observe at faint magnitudes is limited in significance by small number statistics , and almost certainly @xmath2 is steeper than our fits would indicate , because of magnitude dependent incompleteness .",
    "clearly much further observational work is needed to improve the completeness of the census of local group members at faint absolute magnitudes .",
