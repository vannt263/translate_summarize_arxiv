    "compared to the knowledge gleaned from the large sample of giant planets around sun - like stars , little is known about the characteristics of jovian planets around m dwarfs .",
    "this is due primarily to the empirical finding that the occurrence rate of detectable planets scales with stellar mass @xcite ; low - mass stars ( @xmath3  ) simply do not harbor giant planets very frequently @xcite .",
    "the frequency of giant planets with  @xmath9  around sun - like stars is 8% within 2.5 au @xcite , and the occurrence of giant planets around m dwarfs is roughly a factor of 4 lower .",
    "while the lower masses of m dwarfs decreases the likelihood of giant planet occurrence , a handful of jovian planets have been discovered around low - mass stars .",

    "these planets and their host stars demonstrate that stellar mass is not the only characteristic that correlates with the probability of a star harboring a planet .",
    "stellar metallicity has been shown to be a strong predictor of planet occurrence around sun - like stars @xcite , and the correlation between planet frequency and stellar metal content appears to hold for the m dwarfs , as well .",
    "@xcite found that m dwarfs with jovian planets tend to be significantly metal - rich compared to a 10 pc , volume - limited sample of stars on the lower main sequence .",

    "if this preliminary trend proves to be real then it will provide valuable constraints for theoretical models of planet formation around a broad range of stellar characteristics .",
    "the effect of metallicity on planet occurrence will also inform the target selection of future doppler and transit surveys targeting low - mass stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , as well as the interpretation of results from direct - imaging , astrometric and microlensing surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "thus , the detection rate of giant planets around m dwarfs consistently lags behind that of higher mass stars , despite the enhanced detectability of planets around less massive stars since @xmath64 for a fixed planet mass and period .",
    "the contrast between the measured planet fractions between m dwarfs and massive stars points to an even stronger correlation between stellar mass and planet occurrence than measured by @xcite .",
    "the correlation between stellar mass and planet formation is an important piece of observational evidence in support of the core accretion model of planet formation . in this model ,",
    "giant planets form in a bottom - up process , starting with the collisions of small dust grains and proceeding up through the formation of large protoplanetary cores ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "once these cores attain a critical mass of @xmath65  m@xmath66 , they can rapidly accrete gas from the surrounding disk .",
    "given the limited lifetime of the gas disk , which dissipates on timescales less than 5  myr @xcite , the formation of gas giant planets is a race against time that is rarely won in the protoplanetary disks of low - mass stars .",
    "the low density of raw materials , low orbital frequencies ( @xmath67 at fixed @xmath68 ) , and unfavorable temperature profiles in the disks around m - type stars greatly inhibit the core growth , which results in a lower occurrence of giant planets @xcite .",
    "another important predictor of planet occurrence is stellar metallicity .",
    "@xcite showed the fraction of sun - like stars with planets correlates strongly with [ fe / h ] , with an occurrence rate of @xmath69% for  @xmath70 and a rise to @xmath71% for  @xmath72 . until recently , it was difficult to properly account for metallicity among the m dwarfs because the lte spectral analysis tools used for more massive stars are not amenable to the complex spectra of low - mass stars @xcite . because of the lack of knowledge about the metallicity distribution of m dwarfs in general , and low - mass stars with planets in particular , it was difficult to determine whether stellar mass or metallicitiy lay at the root cause of the puacity of planets around m dwarfs .",
    "the mass / metallicity issue was recently addressed by @xcite , who derived a revised broad - band photometric metallicity calibration for m dwarfs .",
    "they examined a sample of m dwarfs with f , g and k wide binary companions . by anchoring the metallicity of the m dwarf to its earlier - type companion ,",
    "johnson & apps observed that metal - rich m stars reside `` above '' the mean main sequence of the solar neighborhood when viewed in the  plane .",
    "further , they noticed the majority of the 7 planetary systems ( containing planets of all masses ) that were known at the time contain metal - rich host stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr ] shows that with the addition of 3 new planet - host stars since the study of johnson & apps the planet - metallicity correlation among m dwarfs appears to persist .",
    "we can quantify this relationship by examining the fraction of stars in our keck survey with  @xmath73 that harbor giant planets .",

    "if we restrict our analysis to  @xmath7 ( dashed line in figure  [ fig : hr ] ) , 3 of these 33 `` super - metal - rich '' stars harbor planets , corresponding to @xmath79% .",
    "the uncertainties in our measured planet fractions are large due to the small sample sizes involved .",
    "this underscores the need for extending the time baseline of our current survey and expanding the target list to include additional low - mass stars .",
    "future surveys of nearby , low - mass stars such as the m2k planet search ( apps et al .",
