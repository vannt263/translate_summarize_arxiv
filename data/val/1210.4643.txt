    "recently people feel data in various fields due to developments in information and communication technology ( ict ) .",
    "this circumstance enables us to collect , store , and analyse data on our socio - economic environment in order to interpret our society and to pursue evidence - based management",
    ". one can collect and accumulate large amounts of socio - economic data on human activities , and analyse and visualise them .",
    "vast amounts of data collected from socio - economic systems have made new types of commercial services and research fields emerging . according to m.f .",
    "goodchild  @xcite , every human is able to act as an intelligent sensor , and in that sense , the earth s surface is currently occupied by more than six billion sensors .",
    "we can extract information from an amount of data , construct knowledge from lots of information , and hopefully establish wisdom from several pieces of knowledge .",
    "specifically , researchers in the fields of sociology , economics , informatics , and physics are focusing on these frontiers and have launched data - centric social sciences in order to understand the complexity of socio - economic systems  @xcite",
    ".    however , since our society which is the sum total of both internal and external states of individuals is several orders of magnitude more complicated than each individual , it seems difficult to image how we could manage to capture the real totality of its states with the cooperation of many agencies .",
    "the nature of this problem is referred to recognised as `` complexity '' , which is a new research field into knowledge on groups of people , organisations , communities , and the economy actually behave in the real world .",
    "information theory describes the number of possible states of a system as its `` complexity '' .",
    "complexity may be estimated with shannon information entropy or thermodynamic entropy .",
    "for example , researchers have used a methodology to characterise the structure of networks with information - theoretic entropy  @xcite . according to a study by dehmer and mowshowitz  @xcite ,",
    "the concept of graph entropy was first proposed in the 1950s to measure structural complexity .",
    "rashevsky  @xcite , trucco  @xcite , and mowshowitz  @xcite were the first researchers to define and investigate the entropy of graphs .",
    "several graph invariants , such as the number of vertices , vertex degree sequence , and extended degree sequence , have been used in the construction of entropy - based measures .",
    "wilhelm an hollunder considered the normalised weight of the flux between two nodes as the probability of a symbol in the transmitter signal that corresponds to the sum of all influxes to / effluxes from a given node  @xcite .",
    "sato also considered information - theoretic measures for a bipartite graph , and inferred economic situations using the network entropy of relative frequencies among group populations  @xcite .",
    "bianconi looks at the entropy measure of network ensembles under several constraints  @xcite .    according to heinz von foerster  @xcite ,",
    "complexity is not a property which observed systems possess rather , it is to be perceived by observing systems .",
    "he asks us about it through the following question : _ are the states of order and disorder states of affairs that have been discovered , or are their states of affairs that are invented ? _ if states of order and disorder are discovered , then complexity is a property of the observed systems .",
    "if invented then it pertains to the observing systems .",
    "foerster s definition of complexity proposes that the relative degree of order and disorder is determined by the degrees of freedom of an observed system and an observing system .",
    "one of the most significant reasons that we recognise complexity in observed systems is because of the finiteness of periods when and abilities with which we are able to observe the systems , and the limitations of our memory and a priori knowledge of them that lead to our bounded rationality , or nescience .    from the data - centric perspective , complexity",
    "is referred to as a ratio of an amount of data to human cognitive capacity .",
    "how many megabytes of memory the human brain has ?",
    "von neumann proposed that human memory is estimated as 100 exabits from all the neural impulses conducted in the brain during a lifetime  @xcite .",
    "another method is to estimate the total number of synapses , and then presume that each synapse can hold a few bits .",
    "estimates of the number of synapses have been made in the range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 , with corresponding estimates of memory capacity .",
    "landauer investigated how much people remember at bell communications research  @xcite .",
    "the remarkable result of this work was that human beings remembered very nearly two bits per second under all the experimental conditions ( visual , verbal , musical ) .",
    "therefore , the 35-year accumulation of human beings memory estiamtes of 0.2 to 1.4 gigabits if the loss of memory are assumed .",
    "if the amount of data is greater than this estimates of memory , then all the data can not be memorised by each human being . therefore",
    ", the amounts of data may determine the complexity in the sense of the data accessiblity .",
    "this may provide a kind of definition of big - data in data - centric sciences .",
    "clearly , we also need to carefully consider methods of collecting , storing , handling , and analysing a vast amount of data in computer systems .    in this article ,",
    "i present exemplar studies of observation and data analysis with a large amount of data in several socio - economic systems .",
    "i would like to call such studies `` econoinformatics '' .",
    "econoinformatics needs powerful computer systems to visualise and quantify the behaviour of human beings , adapt to their changing environments , and evolve over time .",
    "furthermore , we should mention the problem of data linkage in data - centric studies .",
    "data linkage is referred as to a method of linking data from different sources with the same elements .",
    "if we can synthesise data from different sources , we may find new insights from the synthesised data .",
    "the comprehensive study is further useful to obtain new findings on our environment .",
    "the literature review on data - centric social sciences is provided in section [ sec : literature ] of this article . in section",
    "[ sec : exemplar ] exemplar studies on econoinformatics are shown . the japanese stock exchange , the foreign exchange market , hotel booking data , and flight booking data are analysed . in section [ sec : discussion ] , a method of synthesising data from different sources , and a method of econoinformatics , are discussed .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "recently , several researchers in a wide spectrum of fields have paid a remarkable amount of attention to massive amounts of comprehensive data . for example , search engines of web services need massive data about hyperlink connections among web pages , and electronic commerce systems need to cover information of various kinds of products . due to the development of ict ,",
    "the advanced information society has already emerged globally and it has gradually made our world smaller and smaller .",
    "the term `` information explosion '' has been coined to describe this situation and has been realised  @xcite .",
    "this term refers to a situation in which the total amount of information created by individuals exceeds the individuals information processing capability .",
    "studies with vast amounts of socio - economic data have several branches . here",
    ", five kinds of recent studies ( financial market data , demographic data , traffic flow data , pos data , and e - commerce data ) are surveyed for the purpose of finding ways of coping with the complexity of human societies .",
    "a large amount of data on financial markets is available because the electronic matching systems of financial markets are spreading all over the world due to the development of ict .",
    "contemporary trading is done through electronic platforms , and settlement operations are done through electronic clearing systems .",
    "financial market data can be collected through a direct application programming interface ( api ) or through the historical data centres of data providers .",
    "applications of statistical mechanics to finance , by means of statistical physics , agent - based modelling , and network analysis , have progressed during the last decade  @xcite .",
    "the launch of the e - stat database by the japanese government  @xcite provides us with new technological means for a data - based understanding of our country . in principle",
    ", everyone can understand the state of our country from demographic data .",
    "furthermore , real - time demographic data are also available since the technologies to collect human activities via personal mobile phones have been established  @xcite . in the near future , we will be able to visualise real - time demographics , both comprehensively and circumstantially .",
    "recently , several car navigation companies have launched autonomous sensory navigation services in japan . as a result",
    ", these companies can collect real - time car traffic data via each car navigation terminal . by collecting data from many cars , one can find roads and points where traffic jams are occurring . without constructing new infrastructure to collect traffic states ,",
    "real - time traffic data can be accumulated due to the development of integrated transport systems ( its ) .",
    "based on such data , comprehensive analyses of traffic flows can be conducted in order to cope with traffic jams  @xcite .",
    "recent developments in traffic measurement technologies have been driving the theoretical development of traffic control and modelling  @xcite .",
    "pos is an abbreviation for `` point - of - sales '' , and all department stores and supermarkets have introduced this kind of system in order to ring up purchases at cash registers . as a result , retail sales can be managed in real - time , and data - centric operations can be done .",
    "on the basis of these massive amounts of data , new marketing methods have been developed .",
    "the statistical properties of expenditure in a single shopping trip show a power - law distribution  @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of retail sales is one of the most promising directions to be followed in order to bridge the gap between microeconomics and macroeconomics .",
    "web - based commerce systems enable us to purchase everything , from books to electronic equipment , via websites .",
    "the details of consumers and goods can be stored on the data - base engine of each website .",
    "if we can use such data , then we may , in principle , capture real - time demand and supply of all items which are traded via websites .",
    "analysing massive amounts of data on items which are sold via web commerce systems is expected to open a window to new economic theory and service engineering  @xcite .",
    "data on hotel booking opportunities  @xcite , international flight booking opportunities  @xcite , and price comparison sites  @xcite has also been studied .",
    "the property that these studies seem to have in common is their ability to overcome the complexity in socio - economic systems , by using massive amounts of data and vast computations .",
    "copious amounts of data on human activities are collected by means of ict , and vast amounts of computation for such data are conducted for the purposes of searching , matching , visualising , and extracting .",
    "large - scale data on socio - economic systems may make it possible to understand our society from a holistic point of view .",
    "to do so , we need to discuss the possibilities of comprehensive analysis and data linkage . in this section ,",
    "four types of exemplar studies on socio - economic systems are shown .",
    "these examples include studies on the japanese stock exchange , the foreign exchange market , hotel bookings through an e - commerce platform , flight bookings through an e - commerce platform . in order to archive a comprehensive point of view ,",
    "both the japanese and international economic situations are measured .      during the last two decades",
    ", it is said that the main problem faced by japan is a low productivity growth rate . despite these circumstances ,",
    "the japanese economy recovered eventually , with the aid of the global growth from 2004 to 2007 .",
    "however , the latest global financial crisis strongly affected many countries , including japan , after the midquarter of 2008 . at that time , we observed that japanese stock prices dropped sharply due to financial turmoil of 2008 - 2009 .",
    "furthermore , huge earthquakes hit japan on 11 march 2011 , and the japanese economy suffered from a large number of social losses .",
    "so far , we have explained the affairs by the japan explanatory narrative .",
    "the question remains , however , as to how we can describe our macroeconomics situations in a more quantitative fashion .",
    "macroeconomic situations strongly influence money flows at all levels of society .",
    "stocks at each sector are traded by investors and traders every minute through the stock exchange market",
    ". moreover , stock prices are so sensitive to money flows , that stock prices in all sectors reflect demand - supply gaps of the money by economic actors .",
    "therefore , they are expected to be useful for detecting changes in macroeconomic situations .    in this study",
    ", we hope to provide some insights on the problem of the quantification of japanese macroeconomic situations , through a comprehensive analysis of stock prices traded in the tokyo stock exchange . in the context of economics and finance ,",
    "there are various methods available for segmenting highly nonstationary financial time series into stationary segments , called regimes or trends . following the pioneering works of goldfeld and quandt  @xcite",
    ", there is an enormous body of literature on detecting structural breaks or change points separating stationary segments .",
    "recently , a recursive entropic scheme to segment financial time series was proposed  @xcite .    in this study ,",
    "a recursive segmentation procedure is applied to an analysis of security prices of 1,413 japanese firms listed on the first section of the tokyo stock exchange .",
    "the number of segments in quintiles in terms of variance is computed in order to detect change points of money flows of the japanese security market .",

    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are denoted as the total number of stock and the observation length .",
    "the daily log - return ( opening to closing ) time series @xmath9 is computed as @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    according to the seminal work by mantegna and stanley  @xcite",
    ", the log - return time series of stock prices are modelled by lvy distributions .",
    "superstatistics suggested that a mixture of gaussian distributions with @xmath12-distributions in terms of variance gives a lvy distribution .",
    "therefore , we assume that each segment is sampled from a gaussian distribution with different mean and variance .",
    "it is assumed that the log - return time series in segment @xmath13 follows a stationary gaussian distribution with mean @xmath14 and variance @xmath15 .    to find the unknown segment boundaries @xmath16 separating segment @xmath13 and @xmath17 , the recursive segmentation scheme introduced by bernaola - galvn et al  @xcite is employed . in this segmentation scheme ,",
    "the likelihood of the total time series is compared with the likelihood of the two segmented time series .",

    "this implies that the arithmetic mean of @xmath35 random variables @xmath36 is approximated as @xmath37 for a sufficiently large value of @xmath35 .    by using this approximation , for @xmath35 observations @xmath38",
    ", we obtain @xmath39 and @xmath40 is rewritten as , @xmath41    @xmath40 can be used as an indicator to separate the observations into two parts . an adequate way to separate the observations",
    "is that a segmentation is conducted at @xmath23 where @xmath40 takes the maximum value .",
    "namely , an adequate segmentation should be done at , @xmath42 if @xmath43 is less than a threshold value @xmath44 , then the segmentation should be terminated .",
    "the hierarchical segmentation procedure is also applied to the time series .",
    "after segmentation , we also apply this procedure for each segment recursively . in order to stop the segmentation procedure",
    "we assume that the minimum value @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath43 is less than @xmath44 , then we do not apply the segmentation procedure any more .",

    "1,413 companies listed on the first section of tokyo stock exchange are selected for empirical analysis .",
    "the duration is 4 january , 2000 to 30 january , 2012 .",

    "these seem to correspond to regimes or change points in the japanese economy .",
    "specifically , during the last global financial crisis the number of segments tends to increase ( about 260 segments can be found at this period ) .",
    "furthermore , after 11 march , 2011 , the great east japan earthquake , the number of segments steeply increased larger than during the last global financial crisis .        the number of segments belonging to the same quintile of variances is counted .",

    "specifically , during september 2008 , when we experienced the lehman shock , the number of fifth quintile regimes steeply increased .",
    "this implies that the money flows of the japanese economy became unstable just after the lehman shock . from march 2009 ,",
    "the money flow eventually recovered , and the number of unstable regimes decreased while the number of stable segments eventually increased . from 11 march to 10 april , 2011 the number of unstable regimes steeply increased due to the great east japan earthquake . however , the number of stable regimes rapidly increased thereafter , and japanese macroeconomic affairs have been eventually recovered .          the foreign exchange market is the largest financial market in the world .",
    "the foreign exchange market is organised by international banks and funds through brokerage platforms .",
    "since the currency exchange strongly reflects and is related to international economies , we can predict global economic conditions from the foreign exchange market .",
    "the analysis is conducted using high - resolution data ( icap ebs data mine level 1.0 ) collected using the icap ebs platform .",
    "the data includes currency pairs , quotation prices , and transaction prices with a one - second resolution . in the exchangeable currency pairs , consisting of 41 currencies and 11 precious metals , 93 kinds of currency pairs are included during the period from june 2008 to june 2012 .",

    "\\(3 ) since several airline companies update their flight schedule every april and october , ticket availability drastically drops at that time .",
    "recently , the airport network has been studied by several researchers  @xcite . according to the study by guimer and amaral  @xcite",
    ", the world - wide airport network has properties of a small - world network . the degree and betweenness centrality distributions exhibit power - law decay .",
    "in fact , the most connected cities ( largest degree ) are typically not the most central cities ( largest betweenness centrality ) .",
    "airports with high betweenness tend to play a more important role in keeping networks connected than those with high degree , because a passenger can travel from a departure airport to a destination with a short path .",
    "the geodesic distance between departure and arrival airports may give a good approximation of the actual flight distance of passengers .",
    "the geodesic distance is measured by vincenty s formulae .",
    "let @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 be the geographical latitude and longitude of two points , respectively , and @xmath78 . under the assumption that the earth is a sphere , the distance @xmath79 is given by , @xmath80 where @xmath81 represents the earth s radius ( @xmath82 [ km ] ) .",
    "it is possible to analyse the geodesic dependence of ticket prices with this data .",
    "figure [ fig : flight ] shows the relation between the price of economy - class flight tickets and the geodesic distance from the departure airport to the destination .",
    "the distance of each flight ticket is computed from the geographical latitude and longitude of the departure and arrival airports using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "[ fig : flight ] represents the relationship on 4 august , 2010 ( high demand season ) and on 16 october , 2010 ( low demand season ) .",
    "short - distance corresponds to flights to asian cities ( 1,000 km to 3,000 km ) , middle - distance to cities in europe and north america ( 8,000 km to 10,000 km ) , and long - distance to cities in south america ( 15,000 km to 20,000 km ) . during high demand season",
    ", it is found that various kinds of flights appear for both short - distance and long - distance flights , but , during low demand season , there are few long - distance flights .",
    "( a ) ( b )",
    "it was shown from looking at these exemplar studies that there are two kinds of axes with which to best represent our society .",
    "the studies of the japanese stock exchange market and the foreign exchange market show that different stocks or currencies are quoted or traded concurrently , and that they are mutually related .",
    "namely , time is one of important key factors to link data observed in different places .",
    "investigation of both the hotel and international flights showed that geographical information is also a key factor to link data from different layers .",
    "since events in the world happen in massively concurrent , time and locations are the most important elements to link results obtained from different data sources .",
    "furthermore , we may synthesise data from different data sources with a time and location , and construct a large - scale database .",
    "i also want to say that these studies are of econoinformatics .",
    "econoinformatics includes several research topics such as mathematical concepts , algorithms , computer systems , databases , modelling , and so forth .",
    "mathematical concepts may help us to develop automated algorithms to extract knowledge on socio - economic systems .",
    "the algorithm and computation systems help us to collect , store and analyse large amounts of data .",
    "it is also crucial to construct synthesised data sets from uncensored data obtained from different data sources .",
    "furthermore , mathematical models will become a guide for us to understand observed systems connecting physical mechanisms with observations .",
    "figure [ fig : system ] shows a conceptual illustration of a research platform .",
    "this consists of data crawlers , cluster computers , database servers , management servers , file servers , and consoles .",
    "the data crawlers collect socio - economic data from e - commerce platforms in the internet .",
    "the data is stored in the file servers . after verifying the data ,",
    "the data is synthesised in the database servers . to construct the synthesised database ,",
    "the data is stored with the time and/or locations .",
    "the management servers handle this procedure of collecting , verifying , and storing data automatically . in the cluster computers ,",
    "the socio - economic data is computed and analysed .",
    "researchers use this system from the consoles .",
    "the concept of complexity was discussed from several points of view .",
    "complexity is determined by the relative degrees of freedoms of observing systems and of observed systems .",
    "recent exemplar studies on data - centric socio - economic systems were reviewed and presented .",
    "the japanese stock exchange , foreign exchange market , domestic hotel bookings , and international flight bookings were analysed from a comprehensive point of view .",
    "econoinformatics can be established from data - centric studies based on large amounts of data on socio - economic systems .",
    "such data can be obtained from our society . to overcome the complexity of socio - economic data",
    ", we need to develop mathematical concepts , algorithms , rich computer systems , and synthesised databases . to construct synthesised data on socio - economic systems ,",
    "spatial - temporal axes should be employed .",
    "various kinds of data collected from different paths may be synthesised with time and locations .",
    "rich synthesised databases representing aspects of our society may help us to obtain deeper insights into our own socio - economic systems .",
