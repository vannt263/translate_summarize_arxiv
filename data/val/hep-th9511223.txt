    "in a recent series of papers @xcite , we studied the general structure of higher - derivative gravitational theories , both for bosonic gravity and for two - dimensional @xmath0 supergravity .",
    "although a wide range of technical phenomena , such as consistent coupling of spin-@xmath1 fields to gravity and the method of super - legendre transformations , were explored , the main thesis of these papers lay elsewhere .",
    "we systematically showed that both bosonic and supergravitational higher - derivative theories exhibit a rich structure of non - trivial vacua .",
    "these vacua can be expressed as non - vanishing vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields that generically arise as new degrees of freedom in such theories .",
    "while these vacua always have non - vanishing cosmological constant in pure bosonic gravity and , hence , are of restricted interest in particle physics , we showed that non - trivial vacua with zero cosmological constant do arise in two - dimensional supergravity .",
    "furthermore , these vacua spontaneously break supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "it follows that higher - derivative supergravity theories can potentially play an important role in particle physics , including introducing what is essentially a new method of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "to realize this goal , however , it is essential to extend our results to four - dimensional , @xmath2 supergravity",
    ". this will be the content of this paper .    in section  2",
    ", we will briefly present generic results in @xmath3 , @xmath2 supergravity that we will need later in the paper .",
    "section  3 is devoted to a short exposition of the methods and results in purely bosonic higher - derivative gravitation that we obtained in @xcite .",
    "this sets the stage for the extension to four - dimensional , @xmath2 supergravity .",
    "we present a simple higher - derivative , @xmath3 , @xmath2 supergravity theory in section  4 and explore its vacuum structure .",
    "we show that a subset of such theories is equivalent to no - scale supergravity with a single chiral supermultiplet @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  5 we give the generic four - dimensional higher - derivative , @xmath2 supergravity theory involving the scalar curvature superfield @xmath4 only .",
    "we show that these theories contain non - trivial vacuum states , with vacuum expectation values of the order of the planck mass @xmath5 , that have vanishing cosmological constant and that spontaneously break supersymmetry .",
    "furthermore , all fields around these vacua propagate physically ; that is , there are no ghosts . finally , we then show that in the limit of large @xmath5 , these theories become equivalent to a generalized type of polonyi model @xcite .",
    "these results open the possibility that in phenomenological supergravity models and , perhaps , in superstring theories @xcite , supersymmetry is spontaneously broken not by a hidden sector or by gaugino condensates , for example , but simply by the new degrees of freedom that arise in higher - derivative terms in the super - effective lagrangian .",
    "in this section we give a brief review of four - dimensional @xmath2 supergravity from the superfield point of view .",
    "we will discuss both pure supergravitation and supergravity coupled to chiral matter .",
    "this is done both to set our notation and to present some of the explicit formulas we will need later in the paper . here and elsewhere",

    "the torsion is defined as the covariant derivative of the supervielbein @xmath14 the curvature tensor is a lie algebra valued 2-form defined in terms of the connection by @xmath15 the number of components in the torsion and curvature is very large and a set of constraints is required to reduce it .",
    "the old minimal supergravity theory is defined by applying the following constraints @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes either @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",

    "it turns out that all superfield components of the torsion and curvature can be expressed in terms of three superfields , a chiral superfield @xmath4 , an hermitian vector superfield @xmath21 and a chiral superfield @xmath22 totally symmetric in its indices .",
    "the component fields of the reduced supergravity multiplet are found to be the graviton @xmath23 , the gravitino @xmath24 and two additional fields , @xmath25 , a complex scalar , and a real vector field @xmath26 .    beside the supergravity multiplet",

    "the result is @xmath49 clearly @xmath50 and @xmath51 are auxiliary fields and can be eliminated from the lagrangian using their equations of motion .",
    "these are given by @xmath52 respectively .",
    "the remaining bosonic part of the lagrangian is just einstein gravity which describes the propagation of a massless graviton .",
    "the fermionic part is a kinetic - energy term for the massless gravitino @xmath53 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the coupling of supergravity to chiral matter superfields @xmath54 .",
    "this coupling is determined by two functions , the hermitian khler potential @xmath55 and the holomorphic superpotential @xmath56 .",
    "the lagrangian of einstein supergravity coupled to the chiral fields @xmath54 is given by @xmath57 this is an integral over the full superspace .",
    "it can be written as an integral over chiral superspace of the form @xmath58 simplification can be achieved using the following fact @xcite @xmath59 which holds for an arbitrary superfield @xmath60 .",
    "hence , a spacetime integral of this expression can be dropped from any action because it does not contribute to the field equations . applying this to the superpotential term in yields @xmath61 where we have used the fact that @xmath62 is chiral .",
    "using the @xmath42-expansion of @xmath41 , @xmath4 , and @xmath54 , we can evaluate the component field lagrangian .",

    "their equations of motion are purely algebraic and can be used to eliminate them from the lagrangian .",
    "after doing so , we get a lagrangian for the propagating fields @xmath45 , @xmath53 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 which has a non - canonical coupling of both the scalar curvature @xmath46 and the gravitino kinetic - energy term to the matter fields .",
    "this non - canonical coupling can be transformed away by weyl rescaling the vielbein and making a field - dependent redefinition of the spinors in an appropriate way . performing these transformation",

    "supersymmetry is spontaneously broken at such a minimum if and only if @xmath73 for some @xmath74 . under these conditions",
    "one can show that the gravitino mass is given by @xmath75 the gravitino mass is non - vanishing if and only if supersymmetry is spontaneously broken .",

    "although @xmath46 contains second derivatives of the metric tensor @xmath78 , the einstein field equations are nonetheless second - order differential equations .",
    "perhaps the simplest modification of einstein theory is to include higher powers of the curvature scalar @xmath46 in the lagrangian .",
    "once we include any power of @xmath46 greater than unity , the equations of motion become fourth - order differential equations . since more initial conditions are required to solve the cauchy problem , one must conclude that the higher - derivative theory has more degrees of freedom than the second - order einstein theory .    a general class of higher - derivative bosonic gravity theories involving the scalar curvature only is specified by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is an arbitrary real function .",

    "we found that these theories possess an even richer vacuum structure and , more importantly , that non - trivial vacua can occur with vanishing cosmological constant .",

    "a simple generalization would be to consider @xmath97 where @xmath80 is a real function of its argument , and @xmath4 is the chiral scalar curvature superfield . note that the apparently more general lagrangian of the form @xmath98 , where @xmath80 is now an analytic function of @xmath4 , in fact reduces to by virtue of the indentitiy .",

    "it follows from that it describes einstein gravity coupled to a complex scalar field with a specific non - linear sigma model kinetic energy and self - interactions .",
    "it is interesting to note that this simple generalization of supergravity , instead of adding higher - derivative gravitational terms such as @xmath123 as discussed in the previous section , promotes the previously auxiliary field @xmath50 to a propagating field , thus adding two real bosonic degrees of freedom to the theory .",
    "this is the simplest example of a generic phenomenon that occurs in higher - derivative supergravity , and will be discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "this phenomenon was first observed at the linearized level in a component field construction of higher - derivative supergravity by ferrara , grisaru and van nieuwenhuizen @xcite .",
    "another way to analyze lagrangian is not to perform the integration by parts",
    ". then the lagrangian does not involve any derivatives of @xmath50 and , hence , @xmath50 is an auxiliary field",
    ". we can then eliminate @xmath50 using its equation of motion .",
    "unfortunately , this equation of motion can not be solved in closed form .",
    "nevertheless , we can see that @xmath50 will be a function of the curvature scalar @xmath46 and @xmath111 .",
    "when substituting back into the lagrangian , we get a non - trivial function of the scalar curvature @xmath4 and @xmath111 .",
    "the non - triviality in @xmath46 means this is a higher - derivative lagrangian for the metric tensor .",
    "these higher - derivative terms describe , according to the analysis of section  3 , the usual graviton plus one real propagating scalar degree of freedom .",
    "the @xmath111 terms imply that the longitudinal mode of @xmath51 , once an auxiliary field , is now propagating .",
    "we again conclude that lagrangian describes einstein gravity coupled to two real degrees of freedom , in agreement with the above analysis .",
    "since the theory is supersymmetric , there should be superpartners for the two new bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "this may seem odd at first , because the supergravity multiplet does not contain any auxiliary fermionic fields to start propagating along with the bosonic degrees of freedom . but",
    "having auxiliary fields that acquire kinetic - energy terms upon generalizing the lagrangian is only one way of getting new degrees of freedom .",
    "another way is to have higher - derivatives acting on the propagating fields . in einstein supergravity",
    "the gravitino kinetic energy is given by @xmath124 as can be seen from .",
    "the associated equation of motion of @xmath53 is first - order in derivatives , as it should be for a fermionic degree of freedom .",
    "now note that the middle component of superfield @xmath4 contains a first derivative of the gravitino .",
    "this can be seen from the @xmath42-expansion of @xmath4 given in .",
    "hence , @xmath125 , for any integer @xmath126 greater than unity , will contain in its highest component terms quadratic in the first derivative of the gravitino @xmath53 .",
    "such terms are generically contained in lagrangian . thus the component field lagrangian contains higher powers of the first derivative of the gravitino .",
    "therefore , the fermionic equation of motion will be second - order , requiring additional initial conditions to solve the cauchy problem .",
    "hence , there will be more fermionic degrees of freedom in the theory described by than just a gravitino .",
    "in fact , as far as the fermionic degrees of freedom are concerned , lagrangian always describes a higher - derivative theory .",
    "these additional fermionic degrees of freedom act as the superpartners for the two new bosonic degrees of freedom discussed above .",
    "it is clear that analyzing the theory specified by is by no means simple . in analogy with the analysis of the bosonic theory",
    ", we would like to make the extra degrees of freedom explicit .",
    "therefore , we would like a supersymmetric analog of the legendre transform method .",
    "in the bosonic case we need to introduce one real field to account for the new degree of freedom . here",
    "we have two real scalar degrees of freedom , or equivalently one complex scalar , along with their fermionic partners .",
    "these degrees of freedom can only arrange themselves into a chiral supermultiplet .",
    "therefore , we introduce a chiral superfield @xmath30 and try to rewrite lagrangian in an equivalent second - order form in which the new propagating degrees of freedom are contained in @xmath30 . in analogy to the bosonic case , consider a new lagrangian @xmath127 the equation of motion of the superfield @xmath30 is @xmath128 therefore , provided that @xmath129 , this gives @xmath130 substituting back into yields the original lagrangian .",

    "this is in accord with the component field discussion presented earlier .",
    "we now turn our attention to the vacuum structure of the theory . to do this",
    ", we need to evaluate the scalar field potential energy using the khler potential and superpotential given in and respectively . a straightforward calculation using yields @xmath137 using ,",
    "we see that this potential is exactly the same as the potential for the field @xmath50 in , as it must be .",
    "the kinetic energy for @xmath33 can be obtained by substituting khler potential into which gives @xmath138 again , noting that @xmath139 , we see that this is exactly the kinetic energy term for @xmath50 in .    an important question is whether or not the potential has stable vacua , denoted by @xmath140 , with zero cosmological constant . by a vacuum we will mean a local minimum of the potential . the cases @xmath141 and @xmath142 require separate treatment .",
    "case i : @xmath141    it is clear from that @xmath143 , so the cosmological constant vanishes . in order for @xmath141 to be a stationary point of the potential ,",
    "the first - order derivatives of the potential evaluated at @xmath144 , given by @xmath145 should vanish .",
    "it follows that we must have @xmath146 to be a local minimum , the scalar mass matrix should be positive definite .",
    "in fact , all the second - derivatives of @xmath121 vanish at @xmath144 except @xmath147 this should be positive in order to have a local minimum at @xmath144 .",
    "this can be achieved by choosing @xmath148 to be positive .",
    "hence , for a wide choice of the function @xmath35 in , there is a stable vacuum with vanishing cosmological constant at @xmath144 .",
    "does this vacuum break supersymmetry spontaneously ?",
    "as stated in section  2 , supersymmetry is spontaneously broken if and only if @xmath149 does not vanish when evaluated at the vacuum . in this case , using equation , we can easily see that @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , supersymmetry is not broken at the @xmath141 vacuum .",
    "we call the @xmath141 vacuum solution the trivial vacuum .",
    "case ii : @xmath151    away from @xmath144 we can rewrite the potential in the form @xmath152 where @xmath153 in general , a local minimum of @xmath121 does not need to be a minimum of @xmath154 .",
    "however , away from @xmath144 , @xmath121 is a strictly positive multiple of @xmath154 .",
    "thus , it is true that a local minimum of @xmath121 , with the added condition that @xmath155 , is a local minimum of @xmath154 with @xmath156 .",
    "we see from that @xmath154 is a harmonic function .",
    "therefore , it can not have a local minimum , except in the special case when it is a constant .",
    "we conclude that if @xmath154 is not a constant function , there exists no @xmath142 vacuum with zero cosmological constant .",
    "now let @xmath154 be constant .",
    "in order to have vanishing cosmological constant @xmath154 must also vanish .",
    "it follows from that @xmath157 must satisfy @xmath158 which has the unique solution @xmath159 where @xmath160 is a constant which we will set to unity without loss of generality .",

    "the field @xmath50 has the normal kinetic energy for a complex scalar field with a sigma - model factor in front .",
    "the field @xmath50 represents one complex scalar degree of freedom or two real degrees of freedom .",
    "the vector field @xmath51 has a kinetic energy term for its longitudinal mode .",
    "this is one more propagating degree of freedom .",
    "note that the coefficient of @xmath123 and the kinetic energy terms of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are proportional to @xmath180 . this will vanish if @xmath100 splits into @xmath173 , a case which we exclude from the discussion as mentioned before .",
    "to conclude , the bosonic part of lagrangian describes the propagation of four real degrees of freedom in addition to the usual graviton of einstein theory .",
    "what about the fermionic degrees of freedom ?",
    "since the theory is supersymmetric , there must be extra fermionic degrees of freedom that propagate along with the new bosonic degrees of freedom .",
    "these fermionic degrees of freedom should be associated with higher - derivatives acting on @xmath53 , as it is the only fermionic field in the supergravity multiplet .",
    "an analysis of the fermionic part of the lagrangian shows that the gravitino field equation is , indeed , not first - order but third - order .",
    "we will exhibit these new fermionic degrees of freedom explicitly below .    in analogy with the analysis in the previous section",
    ", we would like to make the extra degrees of freedom explicit .",
    "therefore , we would like a supersymmetric analog of the legendre transform method . here",
    "we have four real bosonic degrees of freedom , or equivalently two complex scalars , along with their fermionic partners .",
    "these degrees of freedom can only arrange themselves into two chiral supermultiplets .",
    "therefore , we introduce two chiral superfields @xmath30 and @xmath181 and try to rewrite the lagrangian in an equivalent second - order form in which the new propagating degrees of freedom are contained in @xmath30 and @xmath182 . this equivalence was first established in @xcite using the compensator formalism of supergravity .",
    "it was also discussed in supergravity theories with chern - simons terms , such as those associated with low energy superstring effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "consider a new lagrangian @xmath183 the equation of motion of @xmath182 can be obtained by varying lagrangian with respect to @xmath182 . from the first line of we",
    "have @xmath184 setting @xmath185 to zero gives the equation of motion @xmath186 substituting this back into yields the original lagrangian . for completeness , we display the @xmath30 equation of motion which is given by @xmath187    now let us compare lagrangian with the standard form of the lagrangian for chiral matter coupled to supergravity in chiral superspace .",
    "we clearly see that lagrangian describes einstein supergravity coupled to two chiral superfields @xmath30 and @xmath182 with the khler potential and superpotential @xmath188 respectively .",
    "although the case in which the function @xmath189 splits into @xmath190 is excluded from the present discussion , we would like to point out that in such a case is still valid .",
    "however , one can also perform the field redefinetion @xmath191 to render the khler potential independent of @xmath182 .",
    "thus , the superfield @xmath182 becomes auxiliary with an algebraic equation of motion .",
    "one can use this equation of motion to eliminate @xmath182 from the lagrangian and end up with a theory of einstein supergravity coupled to a single propagating chiral superfield .",
    "this is in agreement with the discusion of the previous section .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom in the higher - derivative theory are now manifest in the lowest and fermionic components of the superfields @xmath30 and @xmath182 @xmath192 using the equations of motion and , we find that to lowest order the new propagating degrees of freedom are given by @xmath193 and @xmath194 as in the previous section , the scalar and fermionic component fields in @xmath30 are the @xmath50 field and , essentially , the first derivative of the gravitino @xmath53 respectively . on the other hand , the scalar field associated with @xmath182 is constructed from @xmath50 , @xmath46 and @xmath111 , whereas the fermionic field is , essentially , the second derivative of the gravitino .    to study the vacuum structure of the theory",
    "we need to evaluate the bosonic part of the component field lagrangian corresponding to .",

    "the kinetic energy for the bosonic fields @xmath33 and @xmath195 is obtained by substituting into .",
    "the result is @xmath196 we see that for non - ghost - like propagation of the fields @xmath33 and @xmath195 we require that at the vacuum @xmath197 we can also substitute into to give the potential energy @xmath198 where @xmath154 is given by @xmath199 an important question is whether or not potential has stable vacua , generically denoted by @xmath140 and @xmath200 , with zero cosmological constant that break supersymmetry spontaneously . in general , a local minimum of @xmath121",
    "need not be a local minimum of @xmath154 and vice versa .",
    "however , @xmath121 is a strictly positive multiple of @xmath154 .",
    "as in section  4 , it is simple to argue that @xmath140 , @xmath200 is a local minimum of @xmath121 with zero cosmological constant if and only if it is a local minimum of @xmath154 at which @xmath154 vanishes .",
    "the function @xmath154 has a simpler structure than @xmath121 and it is possible to make some general statements about its zero cosmological constant minima .",
    "first note that the second term in @xmath154 is unbounded from below unless @xmath201 if this condition is satisfied , the condition for non - ghost - like propagation simplifies to @xmath202 assuming that @xmath203 is negative definite , since @xmath195 enters only the second term of , minimizing @xmath154 with respect to @xmath195 gives @xmath204 at which point the second term vanishes .",
    "it follows that @xmath140 must be a local minimum of the first term on the right hand side of with zero cosmological constant .",
    "thus , the problem of finding a local minimum of @xmath121 with vanishing cosmological constant and where the @xmath33 and @xmath195 fields have non - ghost - like propagation is reduced to finding a local minimum @xmath140 of @xmath205 + 4 f_{aa^ * } |a|^2 \\big ) , \\label{u0}\\ ] ] at which @xmath206 and which satisfies and .",
    "the value of @xmath200 then follows from .",
    "the above discussion enables us to construct a wide class of lagrangians which have a rich vacuum structure .",
    "we demonstrate this by considering a concrete example .",
    "since we will be interested in the different energy - scales in this model , we restore the gravitational coupling constant @xmath207 where @xmath5 is the planck mass . consider @xmath208 where @xmath209 is a coupling parameter with mass dimension one .",
    "this coupling parameter need not be related to the planck mass .",
    "we would also like all the fields to have canonical dimensions .",
    "in the above discussion , @xmath30 has mass - dimension one and @xmath182 is dimensionless .",
    "in order to give @xmath182 dimension one , we scale it by @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to write the khler potential in terms of @xmath5 only , relegating mass @xmath209 to the superpotential .",
    "this be achieved if we scale @xmath30 by @xmath210 .",

    "the first is at @xmath141 .",
    "now @xmath215 therefore , at @xmath141 , @xmath216 as required .",
    "it follows from that @xmath217 .",
    "we conclude that the above potential has a local minimum at @xmath218 with vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "this minimum is clearly visible at the center of the potential energy plotted in figure 1 . in order for to be a physically acceptable vacuum , the kinetic - energy terms for the scalar fields must have the correct sign when evaluated at this point , otherwise fields @xmath33 and @xmath195 would be ghost - like .",
    "we argued above that the kinetic - energy terms have the correct sign if and only if @xmath219 .",
    "in fact @xmath220 as required .",
    "explicitly , the @xmath33 and @xmath195 field kinetic - energy terms are given in .",
    "when evaluated around vacuum to quadratic order , they become @xmath221 which is clearly non - ghost - like .",
    "is supersymmetry broken by this vacuum ? using and , we find that @xmath222 it follows that for @xmath223 both @xmath224 and @xmath225 vanish .",
    "hence , supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken .",
    "we call vacuum the trivial vacuum .",
    "are there any other minima of potential ? as can be seen from figure 1 , there is a second local minimum of @xmath213 given in at which @xmath213 vanishes .",
    "it occurs for @xmath226 or @xmath227 for arbitrary real phase @xmath28 .",
    "note that this degeneracy in the vacuum is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the function @xmath80 in , and hence the lagrangian , under the transformation @xmath228 .",
    "it follows from that at this minimum @xmath216 as required .",
    "equation then gives @xmath229 .",
    "therefore , the potential energy has a ring of local minima at @xmath230 with vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "these are visible as the circular set of minima in figure 1 . to check that there are no ghosts in the theory around vacuum",

    "explicitly , expanding @xmath232 and @xmath233 , it follows from and that to quadratic order @xmath234 where @xmath235 , which is clearly non - ghostlike .",
    "the masses of the four real scalars are easily evaluated at this minimum , but the exact values are complicated and unenlightening .",
    "suffice it to say that , in addition to the one zero - mass field in the direction of the circular set of minima , the three remaining masses are numerically different but of order @xmath209 .",
    "is supersymmetry broken at the vacua ? using , we find that the khler covariant derivatives evaluated at are @xmath236 it follows that supersymmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at these vacua .",
    "substituting into gives the gravitino mass @xmath237 which is of the same order as the non - vanishing scalar masses .",
    "note that the supersymmetry breaking scale is set by @xmath224 and @xmath225 , which are of order @xmath238 .",
    "it is conventional to denote this scale by @xmath239 .",
    "the gravitino mass can then be written in the familiar form @xmath240 with this definition , the non - vanishing scalar field masses at the non - trivial vacuum are of order @xmath241 .",
    "the preceding discussion is exact and valid at any energy scale . indeed , as we have shown above , it is necessary to know the full theory in order to determine the vacuum structure .",
    "once one has found the non - trivial supersymmetry breaking vacuum , however , it is of interest to consider small fluctuations around this vacuum , and to determine the effective theory for these fluctuations at energy scales much smaller than the planck mass @xmath5 . we now proceed to do this .",
    "above we did not specify the value of the supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath242 relative to @xmath5 .",
    "for the remainder of this discussion we will assume that @xmath243 .",
    "for example , if we would like the gravitino mass to be of the order of the electroweak scale , that is @xmath244 , then we must choose @xmath245 , eight orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "expanding around the non - trivial vacuum with @xmath246 , we define @xmath247 where @xmath248 and @xmath249 are the fluctuations of @xmath30 and @xmath182 around their vacuum expectation values , @xmath5 and @xmath250 respectively .",
    "we will henceforth consider @xmath248 and @xmath249 to be of the order of @xmath242 or smaller .",
    "the exact lagrangian is given by expression with khler potential and superpotential .",
    "at the scale @xmath242 , since @xmath251 , the gravitational effects become negligible , and the supergravity lagrangian simplifies to the flat superspace lagrangian given by @xmath252 however , in this regime we must also neglect terms in @xmath118 and @xmath62 suppressed by powers of @xmath253 .",
    "that is the flat superspace lagrangian in fact reduces to @xmath254 where @xmath255 and @xmath256 are obtained by substituting into and keeping only the first non - trivial terms in @xmath253 .",
    "note that any terms in the khler potential which are constant or purely chiral plus antichiral , such as @xmath257 , do not contribute to lagrangian . a constant term in the superpotential",
    "also does not contribute . in this limit",

    "the positive definite value of the scalar potential signals supersymmetry breaking at scale @xmath242 .",
    "note that the khler potential and superpotential look like a simple extension of the polonyi model with two superfields . for comparison ,",
    "let us consider the original polonyi model for supersymmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the polonyi model has one chiral superfield @xmath265 with khler potential and superpotential given by @xmath266 where @xmath267 is a constant that is chosen to ensure vanishing cosmological constant .",

    ", one does not change the low energy superpotential or khler potential at the planck scale , except for the addition of the constant term @xmath267 which is required to set the cosmological constant of the non - trivial vacuum to zero .",
    "however , this extension is by no means unique .",
    "as one goes up in energy , one could start seeing generic modifications to both the superpotential and the khler potential consisting of new terms that are suppressed by powers of the planck mass .",
