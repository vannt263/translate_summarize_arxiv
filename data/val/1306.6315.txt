    "experiments on strongly correlated quantum many - body systems out of equilibrium have reached a high level of precision and control .",

    "the understanding of relaxation pathways in correlated systems touches upon fundamental questions of statistical mechanics  @xcite , it can provide insights into the nature of correlated states which is not possible with conventional frequency - domain techniques , and it may lead to the discovery of ` hidden phases ' , i.e. , long - lived transient states that are inaccessible via any thermal pathway @xcite .    stimulated by these developments ,",
    "a growing theoretical effort is aimed at advancing the microscopic description of correlated lattice models out of equilibrium .",
    "a method which is well - suited to capture strong local correlation effects in higher - dimensional systems is the nonequilibrium formulation  @xcite of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", nonequilibrium dmft has been used in a large number of theoretical studies , including interaction quenches @xcite , dc - field driven systems  @xcite , photo - excitation of mott insulators  @xcite and nonequilibrium phase transitions from antiferromagnetic to paramagnetic states  @xcite .    within dmft , a lattice model such as the hubbard model is mapped onto an effective impurity model , which consists of a single site of the lattice coupled to a `` noninteracting medium '' with which it can exchange particles .",
    "a big challenge for the advance of nonequilibrium dmft is the development of appropriate methods for the solution of this single - impurity problem out of equilibrium .",
    "continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) on the keldysh contour  @xcite can provide numerically exact dmft results for short times  @xcite , but the effort increases exponentially with time due to the phase problem .",
    "several dmft studies have instead used second- and third - order perturbation theory @xcite , which works in the weakly interacting regime , but can give unphysical results for larger values of the interaction due to its nonconserving nature  @xcite .",
    "strong - coupling perturbation theory  @xcite , on the other hand , is suitable for the mott insulator , but can not address correlated metallic states at low temperatures .",
    "finally , a numerically tractable impurity model is obtained for the falicov - kimball model , where a solution is possible via a closed set of equations of motion @xcite .",
    "however , because only particles with one spin flavor can hop on the lattice in the falicov - kimball model , its dynamics are rather peculiar , which is reflected in the absence of thermalization of single - particle quantities  @xcite .",
    "impurity models are of interest also in their own right , apart from their importance for dmft , e.g. , for the description of quantum dots or kondo impurities .",
    "recently , sophisticated techniques such as diagrammatic ( `` bold - line '' ) ctqmc @xcite and influence functional approaches  @xcite have been developed to study nonequilibrium dynamics motivated by transport experiments through quantum dots .",
    "while these techniques can address longer times than direct ctqmc simulations , they have not yet been used within dmft , partly because the measurement of time - nonlocal correlation functions is technically challenging .",
    "hence there is a clear need for the development of novel impurity solvers for dmft .    in equilibrium dmft ,",
    "a whole class of impurity solvers are based on a mapping of the impurity model to a suitable hamiltonian representation : the effective medium of dmft is approximated by a finite number of bath orbitals , and the resulting single - impurity anderson model ( siam ) is solved using exact diagonalization  @xcite , numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite , density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite , or ( restricted active - space ) configuration - interaction approaches  @xcite . mapping the dmft impurity problem to a finite siam seems rather attractive for nonequilibrium studies , since it is not a priori restricted to either interaction or hopping being small , and it can thus work also at intermediate coupling .",
    "moreover , it may even serve as a starting point for a diagrammatic expansion using the dual - fermion approach  @xcite .",
    "however , the mapping procedure itself turns out to be more difficult for nonequilibrium situations than it is for equilibrium . in equilibrium",
    ", the mapping of the effective medium to a set of bath orbitals can be performed by fitting the spectral function of the bath  @xcite , while in nonequilibrium , when time - translational invariance is lost , a single spectral function is not enough to characterize a system .",
    "the situation is somewhat simpler in a steady state , which can be characterized by a spectral function and an occupation function ( which is then different from the fermi function ) .",
    "a representation of the impurity problem using a siam with dissipative ( markovian ) terms has been discussed for this case  @xcite .    in the present paper , we address the mapping problem for general time - evolving states .",
    "we prove that the nonequilibrium dmft action for the hubbard model in the limit of infinite dimensions can be represented by a siam , and we discuss methods to construct such a representation either exactly or approximately .",
    "in particular , we clarify how to separate the initial state correlations ( which are represented by bath orbitals that are coupled to the impurity already before any perturbation ) , and additional correlations that are built up at later times .",
    "first numerical tests for a quench in the hubbard model from zero to finite hopping between the sites allow us to address a parameter regime of interactions which is not accessible with the presently available weak and strong - coupling solvers .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : mapping ] , we give a brief overview on the dmft equations and the notation used for nonequilibrium green functions .",

    "we have studied the time evolution after a ramp of the hopping in the hubbard model , starting from the atomic limit .",
    "this setup , which is in principle easy to realize with cold atoms , is hard to solve both with weak - coupling perturbation theory or weak - coupling ctqmc ( which can not describe the initial state ) , and with strong - coupling perturbation theory ( which is no longer accurate when @xmath11 becomes smaller than the hopping ) .",
    "there are several open questions and future research directions .",
    "first of all , it would be interesting to analyze how the number of bath orbitals that are needed for a given accuracy scales with the maximum evolution time .",
    "we have not investigated this question systematically , because the maximum number of bath sites that can be dealt within exact diagonalization techniques is rather limited anyway . for conceptual reasons , however , and for the use of different solvers , this question is certainly relevant .",
    "moreover , based on our proof of the representability of the dmft action by a siam , various other procedures of finding the actual siam appear worthwhile to study .",
    "for example , instead of minimizing the difference between the impurity hybridization function and a hybridization function in the dmft action , one may minimize the difference between the dmft green function @xmath404 ( computed from the lattice dyson equation with the impurity self - energy ) and the impurity green function @xmath405 . the difference between @xmath404 and @xmath405",
    "might actually be a better error measure than the corresponding difference between the hybridization functions @xmath68 and @xmath406 : @xmath407 is a superposition of exponentially many oscillating components whose dephasing leads to a rapid decay of the function at large time differences @xmath408 .",
    "it is thus typically already closer to the green function of an infinite system ( @xmath404 ) than @xmath406 is to @xmath68 .",
    "however , the numerical implementation will be more complicated because the approximation error is computed between two quantities that are both determined numerically .",
    "finally , any method that relies on an ad - hoc truncation of the bath can potentially violate conservation laws of energy or particle number .",
    "there are two possible ways to cure this problem ( apart from increasing the number of bath sites ) : first of all , a systematic perturbation theory around the truncated impurity model can be formulated in the language of dual - fermions  @xcite .",
    "the approach can be made conserving and it can also potentially alleviate other finite - bath size effects , but the evaluation of the corresponding diagrams requires considerable numerical effort .",
    "another very interesting direction is the nonequilibrium generalization of self - energy functional theory  @xcite , where the parameters of the impurity model are not determined ad hoc , but from the stationary point of the dynamical luttinger - ward variational principle .",
    "although the numerical implementation of the approach is slightly more challenging , it is a worthwhile endeavor because spin and particle number conservation would be satisfied in such an approach with a suitable choice of the variational space  @xcite .    as a next step",
    ", it would certainly be worthwhile to combine the mapping procedure with efficient numerical schemes such as dmrg , which might be able to reach timescales that are not accessible with any of the currently available solvers .",
