    "the electromagnetic properties of neutral particles have been the source of great interest since they are generated at the loop level , thereby opening up the possibility for the detection of new physics effects .",
    "considerable attention has been paid to the electromagnetic properties of neutrinos and the neutral @xmath2 boson of the standard model ( sm ) . in particular , the impact of new physics effects on the trilinear couplings of the @xmath2 boson has been studied in a model - independent manner using the effective lagrangian technique @xcite . as far",
    "as neutral fermions are concerned , it was long realized that the off - shell electromagnetic vertex of a massless dirac neutrino is a gauge - dependent quantity @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", a massive dirac neutrino does have static electromagnetic properties which characterize its magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of a majorana neutrino , which only has off - shell electromagnetic properties @xcite , which in turn is a consequence of the fact that a majorana neutrino is identical to its antiparticle .",
    "a more recent model - independent study of the electromagnetic form factors of majorana particles with higher spin was presented in ref .",
    "the situation for neutral spin-1 particles is similar as for neutrinos : a neutral vector boson characterized by a self - conjugate field , for which the particle is identical to its antiparticle , can not have static electromagnetic properties .",
    "this fact has been already discussed in the case of the neutral @xmath2 boson @xcite . on the contrary , a no self - conjugate field",
    "do can have static electromagnetic properties .",
    "the possibility that neutral particles have nonzero static electromagnetic properties was explored in a general context using arguments of gauge invariance and transformation under the discrete symmetries @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "several extensions of the sm , such as grand unified theories ( guts ) , predict the existence of at least one new complex neutral gauge boson with nonzero content of quantum numbers from the global or local symmetries of the theory .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a calculation in a specific version of the @xmath6 model @xcite which predicts the existence of a no self - conjugate neutral gauge boson in a nontrivial representation of the electroweak group .",
    "the @xmath6 model is based on the simplest non - abelian extension of the sm group , namely , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this model is appealing and has been the source of interest recently @xcite because it requires that the number of fermion families be a multiple of the quark color number in order to cancel anomalies , which suggest a path to the solution of the flavor problem . another important feature of this model is that the @xmath8 group is totally embedded in @xmath9 . as a consequence , after the first stage of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) , when @xmath10 is broken down to @xmath11 , a pair of massive gauge bosons associated with four broken generators of @xmath9 emerge in a doublet of the electroweak group .",
    "contrary to what happens in other theories , the couplings between the new and the sm gauge bosons do not involve any mixing angle , which means that they are expected to be similar in magnitude to the ones existing between the sm gauge bosons themselves .",
    "apart from the minimal 331 model , another version including right - handed neutrinos has been considered in the literature more recently @xcite .",
    "its main feature is that it requires a more economic higgs sector to break the gauge symmetry and generate the fermions masses .",
    "this model predicts the existence of a singly - charged boson @xmath12 along with a no self - conjugate neutral boson @xmath13 . both of these new gauge bosons can be classified as bileptons since they carry lepton number @xmath14 , and thus are responsible for lepton - number violating interactions @xcite .",
    "the neutral bilepton is a very promising candidate in accelerator experiments since it may be the source of neutrino oscillations @xcite .",
    "the dynamical behavior of the @xmath1 boson is somewhat similar to that of the @xmath15 gauge boson , due to the nontrivial quantum number assignment .",
    "for instance , the @xmath16 coupling resembles those existing between the electroweak gauge bosons . in the fermionic sector",
    ", the @xmath1 also couples to the quark pairs @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath5 three new quarks predicted by the model .",
    "these couplings induce nonzero static electromagnetic properties for the neutral bilepton .",

    "we would like to emphasize that our main aim is to estimate the size and behavior of the form factors in some illustrative scenarios rather than making a careful study of the allowed parameter space of the model , which is beyond the present work .",

    "however , it is reasonable to assume that the exotic quarks are heavier than the top quark .",
    "therefore , for the corresponding masses we will consider values ranging from 200 to 800 gev .",
    "furthermore , as will be shown below , the maximal value of the fermionic contribution to the static quantities of the @xmath1 boson is reached in this mass range .",

    "the general behavior of the fermion contribution to the static quantities of the charged @xmath15 boson has been discussed to a large extent in the literature @xcite .",
    "the main peculiarity of the cp - even electromagnetic form factors of a neutral particle is that the contribution arising from a degenerate fermion pair vanishes since the amplitude is antisymmetrical under the interchange @xmath134 .",
