    "molecular systems with close - lying electronic states possess an electronic structure that is dominated by strong static electron correlation .",
    "examples are ( i ) molecules far from their equilibrium structure and ( ii ) many transition metal complexes , where static correlation is often sizable . a method tailored to recover static correlation",
    "is the complete active space ( cas ) _ _",
    "ansatz__@xcite for the wave function .",
    "this _ ansatz _ defines an active space of @xmath0  electrons in @xmath1  orbitals , in which the exact solution of the electronic schrdinger equation is obtained by considering a full configuration interaction ( fci ) expansion of the wave function .",
    "accordingly , the cas wave function is defined by the number of active electrons and orbitals and the active space is denoted as cas(@xmath0,@xmath1 ) .    in the conventional cas _",
    "ansatz _ , the construction of a fci expansion leads to a factorial scaling with respect to increasing values of @xmath0  and @xmath1 . as a consequence , active orbital spaces limited to about cas(18,18 ) are computationally feasible .",
    "by contrast , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite  algorithm , originally developed for interacting spin chains in solid - state physics , iteratively converges to the exact solution in a given active orbital space with polynomial rather than factorial cost@xcite .",
    "with dmrg , active orbital spaces are accessible that are about five to six times larger than those of standard casscf algorithms . to exploit this advantage ,",
    "an increasing number of quantum - chemistry dmrg implementations have emerged since the late 1990s@xcite .",
    "methods , with ( dmrg - scf ) and without ( dmrg - ci ) a simultaneous optimization of the orbital basis , were devised and a few comprehensive reviews are also available@xcite . yet , even with larger active orbital spaces at hand , essential parts of the remaining dynamical electron correlation can not be efficiently accounted for within a dmrg framework .",
    "multireference ci ( mrci ) in its internally contracted form@xcite and multireference perturbation theory ( mrpt ) approaches@xcite have been combined with dmrg .",
    "such approaches may be summarized as diagonalize - then - pertub in the state - specific case and as diagonalize - then - perturb - then - diagonalize in the state - average quasi - degenerate case@xcite .",
    "the first step aims at the inclusion of static correlation effects in the zeroth - order hamiltonian while capturing dynamical correlation in subsequent steps .",
    "although potentially accurate , such a strategy comes with a caveat .",
    "this caveat is rooted in the need for higher - order reduced density matrices ( @xmath2-rdms , with @xmath3 ) of the active space dmrg wave function which leads to a considerably steeper scaling of the mrpt or mrci step compared to the preceding dmrg(-scf ) step .",
    "a notable exception is the very recent development of a variational perturbation approach that exploits the matrix - product structure of the dmrg wave function and optimizes the first - order correction to the wave function iteratively by the dmrg protocol@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we pursue a yet unexplored strategy to effectively treat dynamical electron correlation within the dmrg approach .",
    "we propose a simultaneous treatment of dynamic and static correlation using density functional theory ( dft ) for the dynamical - correlation part , rather than aiming for a conventional two - step approach . as a consequence",
    ", the overall scaling cost does not exceed that of the dmrg calculation .",
    "this feature will become particularly advantageous when the approach is applied to large systems . in turn",
    ", the coupling of dft to a cas - type wave function method provides the required flexibility for cases where static correlation becomes important and where dft is likely to fail@xcite .",
    "although hybrid approaches between wave function theory ( wft ) and dft have not been considered for dmrg yet , they have already been studied with other wave function methods @xcite . while approximate dft functionals will introduce errors on the absolute scale , relative energies for hybrid wft ",
    "dft approaches can be obtained with good accuracy@xcite . to avoid the double - counting problem of electron - correlation effects , we take advantage of the method originally proposed by savin@xcite  which is based on a range separation of the two - electron repulsion operator into a short - range and a long - range part . the short - range part of the electron interaction is then treated by dft , while the long - range part is assigned to the wft approach . the resulting hybrid wft ",

    "we present the ( long - range ) dmrg  short - range dft variant , abbreviated as dmrg  srdft .",
    "the theory is formulated generally and applies both to traditional cas configurational interaction ( cas - ci ) and to dmrg .",
    "it further offers a natural extension to excited states .    besides the dynamical correlation problem , a critical issue for _ all _  cas - based methods is the composition of the active orbital space @xcite .",
    "it is a well - established procedure@xcite to make the orbital choice based on natural orbitals ( nos ) and their occupation numbers ( noons ) .",
    "in addition , significant deviations ( @xmath4 ) of noons from the hartree - fock limit of 2 ( occupied orbitals ) and 0 ( virtual orbitals ) have been considered as multireference indicators . in the framework of dmrg ,",
    "two other measures , namely the single - orbital entropy@xcite and the mutual information@xcite , have become popular @xcite .",
    "these entropy measures are calculated from the one-_orbital _ rdm  in the latter case , also from the two-_orbital _ rdm  and can be exploited to examine the multireference character of a wave function and/or trace the amount of static and dynamic electron correlation in an electronic wave function @xcite .",
    "being orbital - based measures , these entropy measures share with nos the appealing feature that they can simultaneously serve as indicators for multireference character as well as selection criteria for the active space . with our new dmrg ",
    "srdft approach , we will explore the effect of effectively treating dynamical correlation through the short - range dft functional on entropy measures .",

    ", we suggested that single - orbital entropies , @xmath124 , and mutual information , @xmath125 , can serve as descriptors to trace and classify multireference character .",
    "we found that a balanced active space should comprise all orbitals with @xmath126 and/or all orbitals within a range of @xmath127 .",
    "as these descriptors can be a useful guide to construct optimal active orbital spaces for dmrg and standard cas - type calculations@xcite , they may complement a selection procedure based on natural orbital occupation numbers .",
    "the single - orbital entropies and mutual information for and calculated at various stretched structures are summarized in figures [ h2o - entropy ] and [ n2-entropy ] , respectively . in these entanglement plots",
    "the magnitude of the single - orbital entropy for each orbital is determined by the size of the corresponding red circle while the mutual information is encoded by line color and thickness ; the thicker and darker the connecting line between two orbitals the larger is their mutual information .",
    "considering first the standard dmrg data in the upper parts of figures [ h2o - entropy ] and [ n2-entropy ] , our entanglement data confirm the chemically intuitive choice that all orbitals involved in or bonding need to be included in a minimal cas .",
    "in addition , in accordance with the boundaries of the entanglement measures defined above for standard dmrg@xcite , the stretched and molecules display significant multireference character .",
    "in contrast , both the single - orbital entropies and the mutual information are significantly smaller for dmrg ",
    "srdft than for dmrg . for both molecules a major part of the dynamical correlation",
    "is indeed treated by the srdft functional , while static correlation is efficiently taken care of by the long - range wave function . upon bond stretching ,",
    "static correlation becomes more dominant , but the amount of dynamic correlation assigned to the long - range wave function remains effectively constant ( cf .",
    "the patterns of green lines for the dmrg  srpbe entries in figures [ h2o - entropy ] and [ n2-entropy ] when proceeding from left to right ) .",
    "figures [ h2o - entropy ] and [ n2-entropy ] further show the effect of truncating the active spaces . for regular",
    "dmrg the static correlation increases and appears to be overestimated in the elongated systems for the truncated active spaces .",
    "hence , the effect of active - space truncation is much smaller in dmrg  srpbe .",
    "therefore , srdft has a regularizing effect on the entanglement of orbitals in the active space as the qualitative picture provided by the entanglement measures does hardly change in dmrg  srdft calculations when the active space is reduced .    from the above discussion it is also clear that the recommended boundaries for assessing a minimum active orbital space with entanglement measures need to be revised for range - separated hybrid methods .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn with respect to the boundaries for natural occupation numbers as active - orbital space measure for the casscf ",
    "srdft@xcite hybrid approach .",
    "the ligand - binding energies of the wccr10 set of ligand dissociation reactions are hard to reproduce by dft and the pbe functional turned out to be the pure density functional with the smallest overall error @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we chose two reactions from this test set to investigate the potential of our dmrg - srdft approach and employed the structural models depicted in figure [ reactions ] .",
    "tables [ reaction_1 ] and [ reaction_2 ] provide all data obtained for these two reactions .",
    "we will focus on the pure electronic contribution to the dissociation energy , i.e.  to @xmath128 , as the @xmath129 data are all obtained by the same constant shift and are reported only as they represent the true experimental observables at zero kelvin .",
    "first of all , we should discuss the effect that the reduced structural model and the reduced basis - set size have on the dissociation energies reported in tables [ reaction_1 ] and [ reaction_2 ] .",
    "this assessment can be done based on the pbe results .",
    "as can be seen from the tables , for reaction 1 we increase the electronic contribution to the dissociation energy @xmath128 from 247.5 kj / mol to 257.5 kj / mol by switching from the quadruple - zeta basis set of ref .   to triple - zeta basis set employed in this work .",
    "this value is then reduced to 240.2 kj / mol by reducing the size of structural model .",
    "hence , when considering a zero - point vibrational energy correction ( see table [ reaction_1 ] ) the experimental reference result of 218.2 is enlarged to 226.7 to obtain the @xmath128 reference result , which is to be corrected for the reduced basis set by 257.5@xmath130247.5=+10.0 kj / mol and then for the reduced structural model by 240.2@xmath130257.5=@xmath13017.3 kj / mol .",
    "the final adjusted reference value for @xmath128 is obtained as 226.7 + 10.0@xmath13017.3= 219.4 kj / mol . in a similar manner",
    ", we can adjust the @xmath128 reference energy of 109.9 kj / mol in table [ reaction_2 ] by + 7.5 kj / mol for the model - structure error and + 12.6 for the basis - set error to finally yield 109.9 + 7.5 + 12.6=130.0 kj / mol .    in table",
    "[ reaction_1 ] for reaction 1 , we note that the dissociation energy strongly depends on the size of the active space in the pure dmrg calculations ; the dissociation energy is increased from 132.8 kj / mol for the small cas to 173.5 kj / mol for the largest cas .",
    "this dramatic spread is not seen in the dmrg - srdft calculations , where it ranges only from 216.5 kj / mol to 225.1 kj / mol .",
    "moreover , we note that these latter energies are in excellent agreement with the reference energy of 219.4 kj / mol .",
    "hence , the dynamic correlation captured in the srdft part allows us to apply a much smaller active space and yields results in much better agreement with the reference energy .",
    "the agreement is also better than the one obtained within pure dft calculations .",
    "table [ reaction_1 ] also allows for a comparison of different srdft functionals . from the dissociation energy of 246.5 obtained with dmrg[2000](30,22)-srpbe(gws ) and compared to 225.1 obtained with dmrg[2000](30,22)-srpbe we understand that the effect of the approximate functional can be larger than 20 kj / mol and thus further away from the reference result ( but comparable with the pure dft result ) .    l@cc + method & @xmath131 ( kj / mol ) & @xmath129 ( kj / mol ) +   + dmrg[2000](30,22 ) & 173.5 & 165.1 + dmrg[2000](20,18 ) & 169.9 & 161.5 + dmrg[2000](10,10 ) & 132.8 & 124.3 +   + dmrg[2000](30,22)-srpbe(gws ) & 246.5 & 238.1 + dmrg[2000](30,22)-srpbe & 225.1 & 216.6 + dmrg[2000](20,18)-srpbe & 227.9 & 219.4 + dmrg[2000](10,10)-srpbe & 216.5 & 208.0 +   + pbe & 240.2 & 231.8 + pbe ( full complex / def2-tzvp ) & 257.5 & 249.0 + pbe ( full complex / def2-qzvpp from ref .  ) & 247.5 & 239.0 +   + exp .",

    "as this change in energy also increases the deviation from the experimental reference energy although the cas was enlarged and should have improved on the small - cas result , it calls for a systematic investigation ( data reported also in table [ reaction_2 ] ; see also the total electronic energies reported in the supporting information@xcite , which clearly show that the change in dissociation energy is brought about by the product structure only ) .",
    "we see that the dissociation energies obtained for the small- to medium - sized active spaces in table [ reaction_2 ] only change moderately .",
    "however , for dmrg(18,18 ) we observe a significant lowering of the dissociation energy , which can be explained by closer investigation of the orbitals that were absent in the smaller - cas calculations ( for orbital diagrams and natural occupation numbers see the supporting information@xcite ) : in the product structure , the newly added occupied orbital ( orbital no .  56 ) differs with an occupation number of 1.966 significantly from 2.000 .",
    "it is also different from the occupation number of 1.992 obtained for its corresponding orbital in the reactant structure ( orbital no .",
    "this large change demands the inclusion of the orbital pair for a correct description of the reaction , especially when dynamical correlation is not accounted for otherwise .",
    "notably , the dmrg(8,8 ) to dmrg(16,16 ) calculations do not include this orbital in the cas of the product structure , and the better correspondence with experiment must therefore be considered fortuitous . in the largest cas",
    "considered , we obtained 44.3 kj / mol for the electronic contribution to the dissociation energy .",
    "compared to the 34.0 kj / mol for dmrg(22,20 ) we thus again start to improve the correspondence to the experimental dissociation energy , although the deviation is still dramatic , which might be taken as an indication that dynamic correlation is pivotal in the dissociated fragments .",
    "we carried out a similar investigation of the orbitals for the dmrg - srpbe calculations . in this case",
    ", the effective inclusion of dynamical correlation renders the change in occupation numbers about an order of magnitude smaller . for the orbital pair discussed above",
    ", the occupation numbers change from 1.996 ( orbital no .",
    "59 ) in the reactant to 1.991 ( orbital no .",
    "55 ) in the product .",
    "accordingly , the dissociation energy is less affected ( the results being 80.6 kj / mol for the smallest cas and 81.7 kj / mol for the largest cas ) .",
    "we note that these results are similar to the corresponding pbe result of 86.4 kj / mol , but still largely deviate from the reference value of 130.0 kj / mol . in order to understand whether the approximate nature of the short - range functional can account for this deviation , we investigated the alternative srpbe(gws ) functional which yields an dissociation energy of 101.8 kj / mol that is considerably closer the reference .",
    "clearly , changing the srdft functional is not a universal solution as the srpbe(gws ) functional for the dissociation energy of reaction 1 yields 246.5 kj / mol , thus overestimating reaction-1 reference value of 219.4 kj / mol .",
    "hence , this srdft - functional study emphasizes that the available short - range functionals should be improved , as has also been noted by others@xcite .",

    "focusing on one functional ( pbe and its short - range variant ) , we found for reaction 1 a significant improvement on both pure dmrg and pure pbe results .",
    "however , the situation was more delicate in the case of reaction 2 for which we found a dramatic dependence of the reaction energy on the inclusion of specific orbitals in the active space such that the pure dmrg result deviates significantly from the experimental reference , indicating a very pronounced contribution of orbitals beyond the chosen active spaces to the correlation energy . still , the final dmrg - srpbe result turned out to be very similar to the pure pbe result .",
    "however , we also noted that all data still deviated much from the experimental reference , which might even be taken as an indication to reinvestigate the accuracy of the experimental value .",
    "with dmrg as the wave function part , dmrg  srdft provides access to much larger complete active orbital spaces than those feasible with any traditional cas - type approach combined with dft .",
    "hence , including dynamical correlation through a short - range density functional is a viable option to preserve the efficiency of dmrg calculations by avoiding standard perturbation - theory - based approaches .",
