    "in the last decades , a considerable number of dynamical systems has been studied and a great deal of attention has been paid to the analysis of its transport properties . in particular , the study of diffusion and transport properties of physical systems with short or long - range correlations in the disorder distribution has attracted a renewed interest  @xcite .",
    "for instance , the unexpected high conductance of several doped quasi - one - dimensional polymers was explained by assuming pairwise correlations in the disorder distribution  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the suppression of anderson localization was recently confirmed experimentally in semiconductor superlattices with intentional correlated disorder  @xcite .",
    "further , it was demonstrated that long - range correlations in site also act towards the delocalization of 1d quasiparticle states  @xcite .",
    "the 1d anderson model with long - range correlated diagonal disorder displays a finite phase of extended states in the middle of the band of allowed energies , with two mobility edges separating localized and extended states  @xcite . this result",
    "was experimentally validated by microwave transmission spectra through a single - mode waveguide with inserted correlated scatterers  @xcite .",
    "the above results have motivated the study of other model systems that can be mapped onto the anderson model , such as magnetic  @xcite and harmonic chains  @xcite .    in the context of stochastic process , morgado et al .",
    "@xcite , studied diffusion in systems with long - range time correlation .",
    "first , they establish a direct connection between the noise density of states , @xmath2 , and the diffusive process .",
    "second , they conjecture that the dynamics of a hamiltonian system with space correlated disorder could be described by the same formalism if one supposes that the fluctuation in the density of states of the quasi - particle or elementary excitation , @xmath3 , plays the same role as @xmath4 in the stochastic description . in this work",
    ", we present a numerical analysis of the validity of this conjecture .",
    "we study it for the one - dimensional quantum heisenberg model exhibiting long - range correlations in the random exchange couplings . for continuous ranges of the degree of correlation ,",
    "this system presents super - diffusive and ballistic motions  @xcite .",
    "here , we provide numerical evidence that the hamiltonian description and the stochastic one can be unified through the referred conjecture , thus confirming early expectations @xcite .",
    "let us suppose that the equation of motion for an operator @xmath5 can be cast in the form  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a stochastic noise subject to the conditions @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and to the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite:@xmath10 here , @xmath11 indicates an ensemble average in thermal equilibrium . in principle",
    ", the presence of the kernel @xmath12 allows us to study a large number of correlated processes .",
    "for example , in analogy with the usual langevin s equation , we can study the asymptotic behavior of the second moment of the variable , @xmath13 namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant . in eq .",
    "( [ 3.5 ] ) , we have @xmath16 for normal diffusion ; for sub- and super - diffusion , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .    the generalized field , @xmath7 , in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) can be modeled by a thermal bath composed of harmonic oscillators ; consequently , according to eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) , the memory function can be written as @xmath19 where @xmath2 is the noise density of states .",
    "it has been proved @xcite that _",
    "_ if the laplace transform of the memory function of a unidimensional system behaves as__@xmath20 _ _ then the diffusion exponent is__@xmath21 in disordered hamiltonian systems the diffusion process can be studied through direct integration of the equations of motion  @xcite .",
    "now then , how can we assure that the two approaches are compatible and lead to the same results ?",
    "for those systems the density of states of the quasi - particle or of the elementary excitation , @xmath22 , plays the most significant role .",
    "however , it displays fluctuations , which are intrinsically connected to the diffusive behavior . here",
    ", we conjecture that , for the relaxation processes , the fluctuation in the density of states , @xmath23 , plays the same role as the noise density of states in the stochastic process , thus @xmath24 consequently , if we calculate @xmath23 we can obtain the memory function through eq .",
    "( [ gamma(t ) ] ) and the diffusion exponent using eqs . ( [ ron ] ) and ( [ mobh ] ) .",
    "below , we explore these ideas in the framework of the referred magnetic hamiltonian system @xcite",
    ".    the one - dimensional heisenberg chain with long - range correlated random exchange couplings can be described by the hamiltonian  @xcite@xmath25 where @xmath26 , and the exchange integral is defined by @xmath27 here , @xmath28 are random phases , and @xmath29 is a power law spectrum in the k space given by @xmath30 by using a numerical renormalization group technique , it was predicted that this hamiltonian supports a phase of low - energy extended spin waves in the strongly correlated regime @xmath31 . associated with these non - scattered modes , the spread of an initially localized wave packet displays a ballistic behavior in the long time limit  @xcite ; i.e. eq .",
    "( [ 3.5 ] ) with @xmath32 . in the weakly correlated regime , @xmath33 ,",
    "a super - diffusive behavior is obtained with @xmath34 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the wave packet dynamics was investigated by means of a direct integration of the equations of motion using a fourth order runge - kutta method  @xcite . in this case",
    "the site spin operator @xmath35 is here identified with operator @xmath5 in the stochastic formalism . therefore if conjecture ( [ rhofrhon ] ) is true the exponent of eq .",
    "( [ mobh ] ) should match the one calculated using the hamiltonian dynamics @xcite .",
    "now we describe the numerical method used to obtain the dynamical behavior , which consists in calculating the laplace transform @xmath36 of the memory function @xmath12 defined by eq .",
    "( [ gamma(t ) ] ) . however , we first compute the function @xmath23 , defined by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is an average over chains with different random sets of exchange integrals . to that end , we use dean s numerical method  @xcite to obtain the spin - wave density of states , @xmath22 , and the corresponding @xmath23 , shown in fig",
    ". 1 , for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "it is clear from the data that , for low energies , the fluctuations @xmath23 in the correlated case , @xmath40 in this figure , are smaller than the uncorrelated case ( @xmath39 ) . for @xmath31 ,",
    "it was shown in ref @xcite that the low energy states are extended , and that the density of states has a similar behavior as that of the pure chain .",
    "therefore , we concluded that the finite value for @xmath23 obtained in the correlated case ( @xmath40 ) was not stable in the thermodynamic limit . in order to obtain the most probable value of the fluctuations in the correlated case",

    "[ fig1_a ] , we show the scaling as a function of the energy @xmath41 . if @xmath45 vanishes when we increase the chain size , the fluctuations are finite in the thermodynamic limit . however , if @xmath46 , the fluctuations @xmath23 decrease to zero when we increase the chain size . in order to clarify this figure , we interpolated the data using a bezier interpolation function . in the insets we show the original data without interpolations .",
    "we use @xmath47 , and three distinct values for @xmath48 .",
    "2(a ) displays the results for @xmath39 . from this figure",
    "we can see that @xmath49 in all energy ranges , except at @xmath50 .",
    "this indicates the existence of an extended state at this energy , which is determinant in the super - diffusive behavior .",

    "the presence of a finite range of energy with extended states , @xmath55 for @xmath51 ( @xmath56 ) , is responsible for the ballistic behavior  @xcite .     as function of energy @xmath41 . here",

    "superdiffusive propagation of a wave packet was also obtained in the one - dimensional fibonacci and thue - morse lattices , which present deterministic aperiodic order .",
    "since the numerical method has greater errors for smaller values of @xmath41 , we find it difficult to obtain the density of states for small @xmath41 ( large times ) .",
    "this sort of error is expected to have an influence on small values of @xmath73 in the laplace transform .",

    "the step is the expected result  @xcite .",
    "the main results reported in this work are the following : first , for the heisenberg system we have calculated the superdiffusive and ballistic exponents with reasonable precision .",
    "second , we have been able to associate a memory function to a hamiltonian , through which we unite two powerful formalisms : a stochastic description and the quantum equations of motion .",
    "this result may have implications far beyond the specific example outlined in this work .",
    "evidently , we need more simulations and experiments connecting the exponents @xmath77 and @xmath82 in several diffusive processes in order to have a more complete picture of the validity of conjecture ( [ rhofrhon ] ) .",
    "it is important to notice that there are many phenomena associated with those described here .",
    "for example , in the ballistic regime ( @xmath32 ) , there remains some open issues concerning the use of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite .",
    "since the early experiment of kauzmann  @xcite , situations have been found where the systems do not thermalize , usually associated with their slow dynamics  @xcite .",
    "this slow dynamics is due to the softening of the lower fluctuating modes , here identified by the presence of a finite range of energy with extended states : @xmath55 for @xmath51 .",
    "this effect has been used recently @xcite to obtain ballistic diffusion in ratchet devices .",
    "another related phenomenon is chaos synchronization  @xcite , which presents a reduction in the allowed phase space . a large time to achieve equilibrium , or",
    "the absence of some regions of the phase space , leads to the same effect . some of its important consequences , such as violation of ergodicity  @xcite and of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite , have been observed .",
