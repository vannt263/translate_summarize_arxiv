    "transitions are resonantly driven in atoms where the atom s velocity and the spacings of vortices along its path combine to make an oscillating magnetic field component at the magnetic resonance frequency .",
    "experimentally , we measure the excitation probability for atoms _ as a function of their velocity _ and work backwards to infer spatial characteristics of the flux - line lattice .",

    "in addition , this paper presents , for the first time , details of the abmr experimental technique : we discuss technical aspects of the apparatus and develop the theory and modeling used to interpret results .",
    "we begin in section 2 with an overview .",
    "the aim here is to lay out , succinctly , the _ essential _ physics of the measurements in the context of studying vortex lattices .",

    "section 4 contains the theoretical basis of the technique and derives a two - level master equation model that we have found invaluable in interpreting experimental results .",

    "the idea behind our experimental approach was originally suggested by brown and king in the early 1970s .",
    "@xcite  we skim a thermal beam of atomic potassium , @xmath6mostly@xmath7 , across the vortex lattice of a superconducting sample .",
    "the lowest electronic state of @xmath8 , the @xmath9 state ( fig .",
    "2 ) has two hyperfine levels @xmath10 and @xmath11 separated by @xmath12 mhz .",
    "an oscillating magnetic field at that frequency will resonantly drive transitions between these two levels . a @xmath8 atom in the @xmath13 level ,",
    "travelling through the _ spatially inhomogeneous _ magnetic field just above the surface of a type ii superconductor in the mixed state sees a _ time - dependent _ magnetic field that depends on the atom s velocity and the spatial pattern of vortices in the superconductor .",
    "if the frequency spectrum of that field has a component at 462 mhz , transitions to the @xmath11 level will be resonantly driven .",
    "atoms with different velocities are sensitive to different _ spatial _ periodicities of the vortex lattice magnetic field . as an example , an atom with a velocity of 462 m / s  a typical velocity for an atom in a thermal potassium beam  will be excited by vortices spaced 1 @xmath14 m apart , the typical nearest neighbor distance for the vortex lattice with a flux density of about 20 g. _ experimentally _ , we measure the excitation probability for atoms as a function of their velocity and use that measurement to identify important length - scales in the vortex lattice .    the essential experimental operations , then , are : ( 1 ) preparing atoms in the initial hyperfine level ; ( 2 ) passing atoms over the vortex lattice of a superconducting sample , and ; ( 3 ) detecting the fraction of atoms excited as a function of velocity .",
    "we carry out these out as follows ( see fig .",
    "3 ) : ( 1 ) the atomic beam is prepared by optically pumping all atoms to the @xmath10 level of the electronic ground state  the initial level of the 462 mhz magnetic resonance transition .  ( 2 ) 1 meter downstream , atoms pass over the surface of a superconductor where vortices may drive the 462 mhz magnetic resonance transition .",
    "atoms travel along the superconductor s surface for a distance of about a millimeter .",
    "our modelling indicates that only those passing within 1 @xmath14 m of the surface are significantly excited .",
    "( 3 ) atoms excited by the vortex lattice are detected using laser induced fluorescence from an optical transition out of the @xmath11 `` final '' hyperfine level .",
    "the doppler shift between the atomic optical transition and the laser tuning allows a specific velocity - class of atoms to be excited and a data run consists of progressively tuning into resonance and measuring fluorescence for the different velocity - classes of atoms in the atomic beam .",

    "show representative data taken for vortex lattices created in a single - crystal detwinned ybco platelet .",
    "the sample was cooled through its superconducting transition in the presence of a weak bias field ( `` field - cooled '' ) . for these data ,",
    "the direction of the bias field is perpendicular to the superconductor .",
    "this is the ybco sample s crystalline @xmath15-axis and the @xmath16-axis in the analysis below .",
    "the atomic beam passes over the sample parallel to the @xmath17-axis of the crystal , our `` @xmath18-axis . ''",
    "to identify important lengths in the vortex lattice , we display the measured excitation probability as a function of the length scale , @xmath19 for which a given atom velocity , @xmath20 , is sensitive . in fig .",
    "4 we show a series of measurements taken for different bias fields and observe the expected qualitative trend  as the field is increased , the vortices become more tightly packed .    sometimes , _ structural _ information may be immediately extracted from measurements .",
    "5 shows data taken at 10 k after field cooling  the sample in a 12 g bias field .",
    "below , we show how these data , through comparisons with model predictions , can provide a detailed picture of the vortex lattice . here",
    ", we will take a less formal look at the measurements .",
    "decoration experiments by dolan et al @xcite have found that triangular vortex lattices form in ybco samples with the lattice slightly distorted by being compressed along the a - axis of the crystal . in fig .",
    "6 , we show an undistorted triangular lattice and consider first the abmr signal that would be expected from it .",
    "now , the strongest peaks in our data are due to periodically spaced rows of nearest neighbor atoms .",
    "there are three sets of such rows , as are indicated on the figure .",
    "we do not know , _ a priori _ , the orientation of the vortex lattice with respect to the atomic beam . if they were aligned as shown in fig .",
    "6a ) ,  we would expect a single peak  the periodicity along the atomic beam for the dashed rows is the same as for the dotted rows and the beam travels along those rows indicated by the solid line .",
    "thus , the fact that we see _ _  two _ _ peaks in fig .",
    "5 indicates that the vortex lattice s orientation is _ tilted _ with respect to the atomic beam . and",
    "the fact that we see _ only _ two peaks suggests that vortex lattice has the _ same orientation _ over the entire surface of the sample @xcite fig .",
    "6b )  considers this case and the darker bars indicate the principal periodicities seen along the atomic beam . for an angle of tilt , @xmath21 these",
    "are found to be : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the nearest neighbor vortex spacing .",
    "the _ ratios _ of these may be used to find the tilt between the atomic beam and the vortex lattice : for a given tilt , the ratios are independent of the vortex density ( i.e. magnetic field ) and are unchanged even if the vortex lattice is compressed along the axis of the beam : @xmath24 identifying the 1.68 @xmath25 and 1.24 @xmath14 m peaks in fig 6 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , determines that the vortex lattice is tilted 15@xmath28 from the atomic beam  the crystalline @xmath29axis .",
    "the relative orientation of the vortex lattice and the underlying crystalline axes was found to be a robust property : we have made vortex lattices many times in this sample and found the lattice to form _",
    "always _ oriented the same way .",
    "interestingly , there is _ no _ immediately obvious connection between the orientation of the vortex lattice and either the underlying crystalline symmetry or the edges of the sample .",
    "the positions of the peaks in fig .",
    "5 together with the vortex density can be used to determine the _ distortion _ of the vortex lattice relative to the atomic beam (= @xmath17-axis of the crystalline host in the present case ) . for an undistorted triangular lattice ,",
    "the nearest neighbor spacing is @xmath30where @xmath31 is the quantum of flux and @xmath32 is the flux density perpendicular to the surface . using a miniature hall  probe array we measured the mean field at the surface of the sample and found it to be 10.7 g",
    " uncertainty due to to screening by the sample makes this measurement necessary .",
    "now , eq . [ peaks ] predicts that an _ _ un__distorted 10.7 g vortex lattice tilted @xmath3315@xmath28 with respect to the atomic beam , should produce peaks at @xmath34 @xmath14 m and @xmath35 @xmath14 m .",
    "however , we measure @xmath361.68 @xmath14 m and @xmath371.24 @xmath14 m . therefore",
    ", the vortex lattice in the sample must be compressed along the beam axis ( the crystalline @xmath29axis ) by @xmath38 and , to produce the correct vortex density , it must be stretched along the @xmath39-axis by a corresponding amount .",
    "dolan et al@xcite define the distortion factor , @xmath40 , as the @xmath39-axis scaling/@xmath17-axis scaling . in our case , @xmath41 this value is consistent with the measurements of dolan et al@xcite , who observed distortions ranging from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in the samples they decorated .",
    "more recently , the small angle neutron scattering studies of johnson et al @xcite found @xmath44 .",
    "this value was later corroborated by muon - spin measurements on the same sample that found @xmath1.@xcite both dolan et al and johnson et al argue that the distortion factor is equal to the ratio of the penetration depths along the crystalline axes , @xmath45 , and both papers contain discussions that compare with experiments that otherwise measure those penetration depths .",
    "briefly , our value , @xmath1 , is somewhat lower than the @xmath46 1.37 to 1.6 reported in polarized reflectivity measurements @xcite and at the low end  of the range , 1.2 to 1.8 found in the josephson tunneling studies of sun et al.@xcite finally , we note  that the third peak predicted by eq .",
    "[ peaks ] for the lattice in fig 5 , @xmath47 @xmath484.5 @xmath14 m , is out of the range of sensitivity of the present experiment .",
    "while crystalline vortex lattices with sample - wide order provide the richest data , _ any _ vortex arrangement will generate a signal .",
    "fig . 7 , for example , shows data acquired from the vortex lattice of a 100 nm thick niobium film in a 13.4 g magnetic field applied perpendicular to the film s surface .",
    "the single asymmetric peak  steep on the short distance side , gently sloping on the long distance side  is characteristic of a strongly disordered vortex lattice with only short range translational correlations .",
    "these data are analogous to the x - ray diffraction of an amorphous solid .",
    "the model - generated curve superimposed on the experimental data is for a vortex lattice with a translational correlation length about 4 times the nearest neighbor spacing@xcite .",
    "we discuss details of the modeling below . for now , fig .",
    "8 concludes this overview section with a gallery of model predictions for several different phases of vortex matter .",
    "in this section , we describe the apparatus and discuss technical details important to the measurement .",
    "see fig . 2 and fig .",
    "initially , a thermal potassium beam is produced in an oven operated at about 400@xmath49 c. the thermal velocity distribution of the atoms in the beam provides sufficient quantities of atoms to allow measurements for velocities between 200 and 1000 m / s .",
    "for the 462 mhz hyperfine transition , these velocities probe distances @xmath500.5  2.5 @xmath14 m . a triangular lattice with 0.5 @xmath14 m nearest neighbor spacings corresponds to an 80 g applied field .",
    "thus for studying superconductors , this represents a `` low field '' diagnostic tool .",
    "the ground state , @xmath51 , hyperfine levels in the thermal atomic beam coming from the oven will be statistically populated .",
    "a laser tuned to the 770 nm , @xmath52 transition  optically pumps almost all of the atoms to the lower ( @xmath10 ) hyperfine level .",
    "a pseudo depolarizer in the pumping laser beam allows all magnetic states of the @xmath53 atoms to be moved to the lower level .",
    "typically  99.5% of the atoms wind up in that level .",
    "the atoms next pass to a differentially pumped sample chamber . for this work ,",
    "the sample was a twin - free , single - crystal ybco platelet with dimensions 0.7 mm @xmath54 1.7 mm @xmath54 0.1 mm .",
    "it was grown by a self - flux method@xcite at the ohio state university .",
    "it has a sharp superconducting transition ( @xmath55 k ) with an onset at @xmath56 k. the sample was thermo - mechanically detwinned in an oxygen atmosphere using a platinum anvil similar to the apparatus in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sample was mounted to a copper stage that in turn was attached to an lhe reservoir via a thermally resistive stainless steel link .",
    "the stage s temperature was measured with a silicon thermometer and could be varied from 5 k to @xmath57100 k using a resistive heater . to reject those atoms that pass too far from the sample to contribute to the signal but close enough to contribute to the background in the detector , a tunnel shaped fixture was mounted above the sample that served as an aperture for the atomic beam .",
    "this aperture extended the length of the sample along the beam and allowed through only those atoms passing within 2 @xmath25 of the sample s surface .",
    "low resistance , @xmath580.1@xmath59 leads were mounted to the sample in a 4-wire configuration so that we could measure the sample s resistance and also drive transport currents through the sample perpendicular to the atomic beam .",
    "three pairs of coils mounted outside of the vacuum system allow us to apply small fields to samples in arbitrary directions .    immediately following",
    "the sample chamber is a stern - gerlach magnet that serves the role of a beam stop and dumps _ _",
    "un__excited atoms from the beam  the `` main beam ; '' this step was included because , otherwise , off - resonance fluorescence from the unexcited atoms caused large backgrounds in the detector .",
    "two side - effects of the stern - gerlach magnet are 1 ) in addition to filtering all out atoms in the @xmath10 , lower level , it also removes from the atomic beam `` signal '' atoms excited to the @xmath60  state and 2 ) the direction of atoms exiting the magnet depend on their velocity . to send different velocity classes of atoms on to the detector ,",
    "it is necessary to vary the strength of the stern - gerlach magnet .      experimental difficulties in detecting the small numbers of vortex - lattice - excited atoms as a function of velocity lead to an involved detection scheme .",
    "at the heart of the detection system is the `` detection laser '' that drives resonance fluorescence in atoms that were excited by the vortex lattice .",
    "the detection laser is directed nearly antiparallel to the atomic beam and for a given frequency , it excites a  velocity class of atoms with @xmath61 m / s .",
    "a portion of the fluorescence is collected by an optical system and detected by a high efficiency detector . in our earlier work , @xcite this detector was a photomultiplier tube . for our more recent",
    "work we use a large - area avalanche photodiode that is cooled with liquid nitrogen@xcite .",
    "there is a magnetic field parallel with the laser at the beams intersection and the laser light is @xmath62 polarized .",
    "an important feature of this arrangement is that , while atoms may be excited by the vortex lattice to any of the zeeman states in the of upper level of 462 mhz transition of , the detection system is especially sensitive to those atoms that end up in the @xmath11 , @xmath63 state .",
    "an atom in this state is driven by the laser in a cycling transition : the laser light can excite only to the @xmath64 of the upper level of the optical transition and this level can decay only back to the @xmath63 state where it may be reexcited , repeatedly .",
    "typically an atom will produce on the order of 200 fluorescence photons of which 40 will be collected and detected .",
    "we found that , despite extensive baffling , the `` detection laser '' caused large fluctuating scattered light backgrounds in the detector .",
    "phase sensitive ( lockin ) detection can discriminate against such backgrounds but this requires a modulation of the atomic beam signal . for this reason , a second beam from the 770 nm optical pumping laser was directed across the atomic beam just after the stern - gerlach magnet .",
    "this second pumping laser beam returns excited atoms to the lower level of the 462 mhz transition thus turns off the signal at the detector .",
    "we mechanically chopped the second pumping laser beam at a frequency of 140 hz .",
    "this suitably chopped the signal at the detector and allowed us to carry out lockin detection at that frequency .    since our initial work @xcite",
    ", we have added a stage that transfers vortex - lattice - excited ( signal ) atoms from other @xmath11 magnetic substates into the @xmath63 state for which the detection system is most sensitive . doing this",
    "both  increases the signal and provides better defined the experimental conditions for quantitatively interpreting results .",
    "the latter is because the @xmath65 states individually fluoresce at slightly different frequencies . without this step ,",
    "it is conceivable that structure in the detected signal could be due to the zeeman structure of the detection transition and _ not _ structure in the vortex lattice .",
    "in addition , knowing that all vortex - lattice - excited atoms contribute identically to the fluorescence signal considerably simplifies the quantitative analysis and modeling of the experiment . to implement this operation , just upstream of the detector , see fig .",
    "3 , the atomic beam is crossed transversely by a beam picked off the detection laser .",
    "that beam is @xmath62 polarized .",
    "a weak ( @xmath66 g ) magnetic field is oriented along the laser beam to define a quantization axis .",
    "as atoms scatter photons from this laser , they are moved toward higher @xmath65 states with the net result that @xmath67 of the vortex lattice excited atoms in @xmath68 zeeman states are moved to the @xmath69 state and detected .",
    "data acquisition consists of measuring fluorescence as a function of velocity  for the atoms excited by the vortex lattice .",
    "two parts of the detection scheme have velocity sensitivity : the stern - gerlach magnet s steering and the doppler shifted resonance frequency of the atoms optical transition . to take data ,",
    "these must be changed synchronously . to make the laser resonant _ with a particular velocity class _ of atoms",
    ", it is most convenient to keep the laser itself locked to a single frequency and to tune the atomic transition into resonance using the zeeman effect .",
    "the detector magnet provides the required field .",
    "data are acquired by changing in step the currents to the stern - gerlach magnet and the detector magnet while measuring the avalanche photodiode current using a lockin amplifier that is referenced to the chopped second pumping beam .",
    "typically , a data set consists of fluorescence recorded for 1000 points ( velocities ) and takes 30 seconds to acquire .    to measure the excitation _",
    "probability _ as a function of velocity , we proceed as follows .",
    "( 1 ) _ _  _ _ the sample is warmed to a temperature above @xmath70 where there is no vortex lattice and data are recorded .",
    "this gives a warm pumped data set , wp , and shows how effective the initial state preparation is .",
    "( 2 ) the sample is then allowed to cool in an applied magnetic field .",
    "for each temperature of interest , we record two fluorescence distributions : _ _  _ _ the raw ` cold pumped , ' cp signal , and the ` cold unpumped , ' u signal that we get by blocking the first pumping beam .",
    "the latter serves as a reference for the measurement , since the strength of the fluorescence signal in this case corresponds to the intensity of the atomic beam coming from the oven .",
    "the signals are smoothed by performing a 20 point running average of the raw data and are reduced by subtracting the warm pumped data wp from the cold pumped signal cp and dividing by the unpumped distribution u. this procedure is shown in fig . 9 for a representative set of data .",
    "note that this way of normalizing the experimental magnetic resonance profiles automatically measures the _ absolute _ excitation probability caused by the vortex lattice .",
    "we interpret our experimental results by comparing our measurements with theoretical signals predicted for likely vortex lattices .",
    "to predict signals we require two theoretical inputs .",
    "first we need the relation between the structure of a vortex lattice in a sample and the magnetic field above the sample s surface ; second , we need to determine the excitation of a atom due to the time - dependent magnetic field it sees as it passes through the field of the vortex lattice .",
    "the magnetic field above the sample surface may be found by solving the london - maxwell equations with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "marchetti @xcite found that for a bias field applied parallel to the major anisotropy ( @xmath71 ) axis of a sample , the partial spatial fourier transform  over @xmath18 and @xmath72  directions  of the magnetic field at a distance @xmath16 above the sample surface is given by @xmath73 \\sum_{l}e^{i\\mathbf{q\\cdot r}_{l } } , \\label{fieldstructure}%\\ ] ] where @xmath74 @xmath75 are the positions of the vortices at the sample s surface , @xmath76 , @xmath77 are the magnetic penetration depths along the crystalline a- , b- and c - axis , @xmath78 , @xmath79 @xmath80 , @xmath81 g@xmath82is the flux quantum , and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are unit vectors .",
    "next , we the consider the excitation of a potassium atom by the  fluctuating field , @xmath85 ,  in its rest frame as it passes over a vortex lattice .",
    "relevant atomic structure is shown in fig .",
    "2 . initially",
    ", the atomic beam is optically pumped to the @xmath10 level and we expect that the magnetic states of this level will be equally populated at the beginning of a measurement .",
    "we consider the excitation of atoms to magnetic states of the @xmath11 level .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of an atom in a time varying magnetic field is : @xmath86 here @xmath87 is the magnetic dipole moment operator of the atom . for a ground state potassium atom , the electron has no orbital angular momentum and the magnetic moment of the nucleus is negligibly small , so the magnetic dipole moment operator is just that of the valence electron s spin : @xmath88 ; where @xmath89 is the bohr magneton and @xmath90 is the dimensionless electron spin operator . expressing the magnetic field in terms of its spherical components : @xmath91 and @xmath92 , gives : @xmath93 the general problem of the effect of an arbitrarily varying magnetic field on an arbitrary mixture of states in the @xmath9 manifold is difficult . we have carried out a limited number of calculations by solving the full time - dependent schrdinger equation using this hamiltonian in which @xmath85 is found by following specific paths over a candidate vortex lattices .",
    "these calculations are extremely time consuming and generally obscure the physics essential to the excitation process .",
    "these calculations are carried out to check the reliability of the approach that we usually use and which is described next .",
    "we begin by using first order perturbation theory to find the sample - averaged excitation rate of the @xmath94 hyperfine  transition for an atom with a given velocity and height traveling above the superconductor . here",
    ", the convention is that double primed variables refer to the energetically lower state of a transition and single primed variables refer to the energetically higher state .",
    "we take as a basis the hyperfine ( variables = electronic spin , nuclear spin ) energy eigenstates for the mean field  that we measure at the sample s surface . the quantization axis is given by this field  i.e. is perpendicular to the sample surface . the magnetic resonance transition is a magnetic dipole transition with selection rules @xmath95 and thus within first order perturbation theory , the problem of excitation by the vortex lattice of the initial , @xmath96 level , reduces to nine uncoupled two - state problems corresponding to the nine allowed @xmath97 transitions .    in appendix 1",

    "@xmath106 is a transition ( electron - spin ) matrix element ; @xmath107 , is the mean magnetic field ( @xmath108 the applied field ) at the sample s surface ; and @xmath109 , is the total number of magnetic vortices in the sample .",
    "most importantly , @xmath110 is the vortex lattice `` structure factor . ''",
    "we also define a _ level - to - level _ excitation rate , @xmath111 , by summing eq .",

    "we jump ahead a little and show in fig .",
    "10 _  first order perturbation theory _",
    "predictions for the excitation probabilities of atoms passing at different heights above the 10.7 g vortex lattice discussed previously .",
    "these curves were generated by multiplying the rates of eq .",
    "[ level rate ] by the time it takes an atom with the given velocity to pass over the sample .",
    "this particular figure used a structure factor that yields a good fit with our measurements , though , at this point the details of the calculation are unimportant and we are using the figure to illustrate a couple of general features . specifically (",
    "1 ) the actual signal from the experiment is due to atoms passing extremely close to the sample s surface  atoms passing at heights over 1 @xmath14 m are negligibly excited . and ( 2 ) the simple perturbation theory treatment `` predicts ''  excitation probabilities greater than unity for atoms that pass close to the sample .",
    "this indicates that for some heights , the transitions are saturated and it is necessary to go beyond first order perturbation theory and include saturation in our description of the excitation process .    in analyzing the experiment ,",
    "those atoms passing _ extremely _ close to the surface would seem to be problematic for an even deeper reason .",
    "very close to the sample s surface , the magnetic field varies widely and treating the fluctuating field due to the vortices as a perturbation on top of the nominal bias field at the surface is not justified .",
    "fortunately , these atoms do not contribute to the signal , but rather are pulled into the sample by van der waals forces .",
    "we include the van der waals force in our modeling by using it to provide a lower cutoff  to heights above the sample included in predicting signals .",
    "this cutoff is on the order of 0.2 @xmath14 m and depends on the atoms velocity .",
    "still , referring to fig .",
    "10 even with a lower cutoff of 0.2 @xmath14 m , saturation effects are seen to be important .",
    "we use a master equation approach to include saturation in our model . as an atom crosses the sample ,",
    "the probability of its excitation by the vortex lattice to a state @xmath100 in the @xmath11 manifold is assumed to satisfy the differential equation ( master equation ) : @xmath115   \\label{master equation}%\\ ] ] where the sum is over the @xmath10 states , @xmath116 is given by eq .",
    "[ rate coefficient ] and we have used the fact that the state - to - state _ excitation _ rate is equal to the corresponding _ deexcitation _ rate .",
    "corresponding equations describe the occupation probability of the lower , @xmath10 states .",
    "the excitation probability for an atom is readily found by integrating these ( eight ) coupled equations for the time the atom is over the sample with the condition that when the atom initially encounters the sample , @xmath117 for each of the three @xmath10 states . for our experimental conditions , intra - level transitions",
    " e.g. transitions between states in the ground level  should be weak .",

    "this is a much weaker assumption than in the overview ( section 2 ) where we restricted consideration to triangular lattice variants .",
    "for example , if the vortex lattice _ actually _ had square or rectangular symmetry , we would discover this fact in the course of the present analysis .",
    "a fit to the data proceeds at two levels : i ) the overall symmetry and orientation of the vortex lattice unit cell ( fig.13 ) is determined by the two length scales of the abmr peaks _ and _ their relative intensities .",
    "ii ) the shape and strength of the abmr signal contain information on the magnitude and range of the vortex correlation function , as well as the penetration depth @xmath165 we retrieve that information by comparing model predictions for various putative correlation functions with the experimental data .",
    "note that the vortex array correlation _ can not _ be extracted by simple curve - fitting to the diffraction peaks , in contrast to neutron diffraction data , since the peaks are _ broadened _ due to saturation of the abmr transitions ( section 4.2 ) .",
    "for the same reason , there is no simple analytic relation between the penetration depth and the total signal strength .",
    "we consider the oblique unit cell specified by the magnitudes of the primitive lattice vectors , @xmath135 and @xmath136 , the angle @xmath154 that @xmath135 makes with the atomic beam direction ( x - axis ) and the angle @xmath166 between @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",

    "this is consistent with typical values for the low temperature penetration depth found by other workers . by combining this result with the the distortion factor found in section 2 , our measurements independently provide estimates of the individual penetration depths ,",
    "@xmath177 nm and @xmath178 @xmath3 nm . these values are virtually identical to those deduced from johnson et als@xcite small angle neutron scattering work , @xmath179 nm and @xmath180 nm , though given the error bars of our measurements , the level of agreement is somewhat fortuitous .",

    "we conclude with some general observations about the abmr technique , itself .",
    "the strengths and weaknesses of the abmr are largely complementary to those of other imaging - type vortex lattice diagnostic tools .",
    "weaknesses include , in contrast to neutron diffraction measurements , the technique directly provides only 1-d information , it probes vortices only at a superconductor s surface and as currently implemented it is restricted to relatively low fields .",
    "in contrast with decoration experiments or electron holography , the atomic beam technique provides sample averaged information about the vortex lattice : it can not look at individual vortices or even domains within the vortex lattice .    on the positive side , some cases  e.g. isotropic lattices or lattices with sample - wide order  the 1-d measurement can lead to a 2-d description of the vortex lattice .",
    "the atomic beam technique does _ not _ require especially thin or especially smooth samples .",
    "nor does it require a large quantity of sample material  c.f .",
    "neutron diffraction studies .",
    "in contrast to the `` one - shot '' nature of decoration experiments and the heroic integrations sometimes required for neutron diffraction measurements , atomic beam measurements are made in near - real time and can follow the evolution of a vortex lattice on a time scale of minutes .",

    "why is it that the atomic beam method is able to make measurements near @xmath70 ?",
    "the sensitivity of the atomic beam method relative to neutron diffraction is a consequence of the fact that in the atomic beam method , the signal is produced by the interaction of the bohr magneton of an atom s valence electron with the vortex lattice field . in neutron diffraction ,",
