    "a defining property of quasi one dimensional ( 1d ) magnets is the weakness of the interchain coupling , whose presence nevertheless usually leads to three - dimensional ordering .",
    "it is natural to consider the ratio of the transition temperature @xmath1 to the bandwidth of the excitation spectrum @xmath2 as a quantitative measure of one dimensionality . in systems where @xmath3 the ordering transition occurs in a state where spins on each chain are",
    "already highly `` collectivized '' .",
    "this means that a very significant proportion of the spectral weight is concentrated in a piece of the spin - spin correlation function , which is essentially one dimensional @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the most natural approach to the problem of phase transitions in such systems is to treat them as instabilities @xcite , driven by weak interchain interactions , of an ensemble of 1d chains .",
    "this approach utilizes the knowledge of the correlation functions of individual 1d chains , obtained by various non - perturbative methods . in this way one",
    "will automatically reproduce a distinct feature of quasi-1d magnets , namely the presence of a broad incoherent continuum in the dynamical structure factor .",
    "hence this approach is quite different from the conventional spin wave theory , which uses individual spins as elementary building blocks .",
    "spin wave theory is known to work well for the coherent ( single - particle ) parts of the spectra , but it is notoriously difficult to obtain the incoherent parts within this approach .",
    "therefore it works poorly in one dimension , especially for spin-1/2 magnets , where the incoherence is very strong .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that excitations of a spin-1/2 heisenberg chain carry quantum numbers different from those of spin waves .",
    "some of us have already applied the approach based on weakly coupled chains to describe the ordered phase of cubic lattice quasi-1d antiferromagnets @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in the present work",
    "we apply an analogous method to the disordered phase and the ordering transition in quasi-1d , frustrated spin-1/2 antiferromagnets with dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction .",
    "the effects of frustration on quantum magnets are very interesting and continue to attract much experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite attention .",
    "we focus on calculating the dynamical magnetic susceptibility @xmath4 , which is related to the dynamical structure factor @xmath5 relevant for inelastic neutron scattering experiments by    @xmath6    note that throughout this paper we will mainly present plots of @xmath7 rather than of the structure factor itself ; the trivial prefactor in ( [ dsf ] ) can be easily restored if desired .",
    "our work is inspired by the recent experiments on the frustrated spin-1/2 magnet cs@xmath8cucl@xmath9@xcite .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that cs@xmath8cucl@xmath9 is described by a heisenberg model on weakly coupled planes of anisotropic triangular lattices . within the planes the exchange couplings are as indicated in fig.[fig : lattice ] .",
    "neighbouring planes are coupled by a weak antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath10 . in cs@xmath8cucl@xmath9 neighbouring planes",
    "are slightly shifted with respect to one another , but in order to keep things simple we ignore this shift .",
    "the effective magnetic hamitonian is thus given by & = & _ kh_plane^(k)+h^(k , k+1)_interplane  , _",
    "plane^(k ) & = & j__i , j _ i , j , k_i+1,j , k&&+j__i , j_i , j , k,^(k , k+1)_interplane & = & j_z _ i , j_i , j , k._i , j , k+1 .",
    "[ h ] in the present work we analyze the model ( [ h ] ) in a quasi-1d framework .",
    "we choose to view the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) as spin-1/2 chains with exchange @xmath11 , coupled by a weaker , frustrating , nearest - neighbour exchange @xmath12 within a plane .",
    "finally there is a very weak antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath13 between neighbouring planes .",
    "experimental estimates for the exchange couplings in @xmath14 are @xmath15 mev , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "although the interchain coupling @xmath18 is considerable , the smallness of the ratio of transition temperature to bandwidth @xmath19 indicates that the type of approach we are advocating might be applicable to @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to the exchange interactions present in ( [ h ] ) we allow for the presence of a dm interaction .",
    "our motivation is once again the situation in @xmath14 , where a dm interaction appears to be present @xcite although it is not straightforward to estimate its magnitude .",
    "this is because the superexchange between two cu spin-1/2 occurs through two cl@xmath20 ligands and not a single one .",
    "one possible dm interaction that respects the crystal symmetry of @xmath14 is _ = _ i , j , k .",
    "[ dm ] note that this form of the dm interaction only couples spins on a same chain .",
    "we mainly concentrate on a dm interaction of the type ( [ dm ] ) but discuss how to treat more general forms in section [ sec : dmgeneral ] .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec:1d ]",
    "we review results for the dynamical susceptibility of a single spin 1/2 heisenberg chain ( with exchange anisotropy ) . in section [ sec:3d ]",
    "we study the effects of a frustrated interchain coupling between spin-1/2 chains .",
    "we determine the finite temperature dynamical structure factor by combining the results for single chains with a random phase approximation in the interchain couplings .",
    "we show that an instability towards an incommensurate , ordered state develops at a critical temperature , which we determine as well . in section [ sec : h ] we study the effects of a uniform magnetic field . in sections",
    "[ sec:1ddm ] , [ sec:3ddm ] and [ sec : hdm ] we carry out the analogous programme for spin-1/2 chains with dm interaction . in section [ sec : dmgeneral ] we show how to treat more general dm interactions within our calculational scheme .",
    "section [ sec : summ ] contains a summary of our results and our conclusions .",
    "let us first consider a single heisenberg chain with `` @xmath21-like '' exchange anisotropy @xmath22 @xmath23 we will be particularly interested in the regime @xmath24 .",
    "the spectrum of low - lying excitations consists of a two - spinon continuum @xcite and is shown in fig.[fig : disp ] for the isotropic case @xmath25 .",
    "there are gapless modes at small momentum and at momentum @xmath26 , where most of the spectral weight is concentrated .",
    "spinons carry quantum number @xmath27 and no one - spinon excitations are present .",
    "the large distance behaviour of the finite temperature dynamical susceptibility can be determined by combining results obtained from the bethe ansatz solution @xcite of ( [ hxxz ] ) with field theory techniques @xcite & & ^xx(,x)=(-1)^x a_x()^1/2 & & ^ .",

    "finally , @xmath32 is a nonuniversal scale , which recently has been calculated in the isotropic case @xcite @xmath33 the third factor on the rhs of ( [ chixxz ] ) stems from a renormalization - group ( rg ) improvement in the leading irrelevant perturbation to the conformally invariant scaling limit of ( [ hxxz ] ) @xcite .",
    "there are further logarithmic corrections to ( [ chixxz ] ) , some of which have been calculated in the isotropic case @xcite and lead to ( small ) corrections to some of the formulas we give below .",
    "we note that the rg improvement in ( [ chixxz ] ) was done using the inverse temperature as the rg scale",
    ". it would be interesting to investigate the effects of working with two scales i.e. the inverse temperature and the euclidean distance .",
    "the rg improvements are important only in the vicinity of the isotropic point @xmath25 .",
    "the frequency and momentum dependent dynamical susceptibility is obtained by fourier transformation and analytic continuation of the time - ordered imaginary time correlation function ( [ chixxz ] ) ( see @xcite )  : ^xx(,+k)&=&(t ) & & .",
    "[ chioq ] here @xmath34 is given by -a_x ( ) ^ ^2- .",
    "the result ( [ chioq ] ) is valid for momentum transfers close to the antiferromagnetic wave number @xmath35 , low energies @xmath36 and low temperatures @xmath37 .",

    "the two - spinon continuum is clearly visible .",
    "the maxima at fixed frequency occur close to the boundaries of the two - spinon continuum .",
    "the longitudinal dynamical susceptibility is given by ^zz(,+k)&=&^(t ) & & , [ chi1dzz ] where @xmath43 is given by @xcite & & ^(t)= -a_z ( ) ^2-&&^ ^-  , & & a_z()= ^ & & @xmath44.for @xmath45 the longitudinal structure factor at low energies is weaker than the transverse one .",
    "in fig.[fig : chixxz ] we compare the transverse and longitudinal susceptibilities for an xxz chain with @xmath46 .",
    "let us now take into account the interchain couplings @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we do this by a random phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , which in the present context can be understood as the leading term of an expansion in the inverse coordination number of the lattice .",
    "the dynamical susceptibility of ( three - dimensionally ) coupled chains are of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the dynamical susceptibility of a single chain .",
    "the fourier transform of the interchain spin - spin couplings @xmath50 is given by j(k_x , k_y , k_z)&=&j_z ( k_z ) & & + j_@xmath51 .",
    "[ jofk ] we recall that we have assumed the coupling along the @xmath52-direction ( between planes ) to be antiferromagnetic , i.e. unfrustrated .",
    "we can recover the results for a weak , frustrated coupling between planes with @xmath53 by simply setting @xmath54 in our formulas .",
    "whenever we thus refer to @xmath54 in the following , this should be understood as corresponding to a weak , frustrated coupling along the z - direction .    in the experiments on @xmath14 the dynamical structure factor was measured for momentum transfers along the chain direction .",
    "we therefore concentrate on such momentum transfers in the framework of our approach .    the elementary cell and the first brillouin zone of the planar triangular lattice",
    "are shown in fig.[fig : fbz ] .",
    "if one probes the magnetic properties of the crystal along the direction of the spin chains , the wave vector transfer follows the trajectory @xmath55 in the first brillouin zone and has been represented by three arrows on figure [ fig : fbz ] .",
    "we see that the wave number transfer along the chain direction varies in the interval @xmath56 $ ] .    in figs.[fig",
    ": chixx_2d ] and [ fig : chixx_3d ] we plot ( minus ) the imaginary part of @xmath57 for momentum transfers along the chain direction for four different values of @xmath58 .",
    "we have chosen parameters such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively . in both cases the temperature is chosen to be above the transition to an ordered state ( see below ) as it must for our approach to apply .    figs . [ fig : chixx_2d ] and [ fig : chixx_3d ] show very clearly that the main effect of the frustrated interchain coupling is to make the line shape _ asymmetric_. the susceptibility of uncoupled chains for momentum transfer along the chain direction is symmetric around the antiferromagnetic wave number @xmath61 as can be seen for example in fig.[fig : chi1d ] .",
    "this symmetry is lost when the interchain coupling is taken into account .",
    "the asymmetry increases with increasing @xmath12 .",
    "the curves for @xmath54 and @xmath62 are qualitatively similar .",
    "another important feature of the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility is that it looks _ incommensurate _  the maximum occurs at an incommensurate value of the momentum transfer along the chain direction .",
    "this is most easily seen in a contour plot such as fig.[fig : contour ] , where the dynamical structure factor @xmath63 is shown as a function of energy and momentum transfer along the chain direction . the dynamical structure factor in the disordered phase of cs@xmath8cucl@xmath9 displays both incommensurabilities and an asymmetric structure @xcite .",
    ".5 cm    -5 cm @xmath64 4.5 cm @xmath65.2 cm      the rpa expression for the dynamical susceptibility is valid in the disordered phase , i.e. at temperatures above the transition to an ordered state .",
    "one can obtain an estimate for the ordering temperature @xmath1 by considering the condition for an instability to develop in form of a zero - frequency pole in @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this pole indicates that the system is unstable with respect to developing collective modes . in the case of an antiferromagnet on a cubic lattice the instability signals the spontaneous breakdown of spin rotational symmetry via the emergence of nel order and the collective modes",
    "are the corresponding goldstone modes ( spinwaves ) . for the case of a quasi-1d antiferromagnet on a cubic lattice ,",
    "the critical temperature obtained in this way is comparable to the experimentally measured nel temperature for @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the leading corrections in the inverse coordination number of the lattice can be calculated as well @xcite . in our case",
    "the instability condition reads [ instability_condition ] 2j(k , k_y , k_z ) ^(0,k)|_t = t_c=1 , where @xmath68 .",
    "we find that for @xmath69 the condition ( [ instability_condition ] ) leads to a weaker instability , i.e. occurring at a lower temperature , except in the case of zero exchange anisotropy .",
    "we therefore concentrate on @xmath70 from now on .",
    "the instability will develop at the maximum of @xmath71 .",
    "the maximum of the susceptibility of a single chain @xmath72 occurs at @xmath61 , but because @xmath73 vanishes at this point the maximum of @xmath74 will be shifted away from the antiferromagnetic wave number .",
    "extremizing @xmath71 with respect to @xmath75 and @xmath76 yields @xmath77 and @xmath78 . setting @xmath79",
    ", @xmath80 we find that the maximum of the resulting expression occurs at a value @xmath81 such that [ extremum ] & & + & & -2im @xmath82=0 , where @xmath83 is the digamma function .",
    "equations ( [ extremum ] ) and ( [ instability_condition ] ) with @xmath81 , @xmath84 , @xmath80 constitute two equations for the two unknowns @xmath85 and @xmath1 .",
    "let us emphasize that a solution with @xmath86 corresponds to an instability at an incommensurate wave number @xmath87 .",
    "this suggests that the resulting order occurs along the chain direction with characteristic wave number @xmath87 .    in general ( [ instability_condition ] ) and ( [ extremum ] ) can only be solved numerically , which is easily done .",
    "an exception is the special case @xmath54 and @xmath25 ( isotropic point ) , for which we can derive analytic expressions .      in the absence of an exchange anisotropy equation ( [ extremum ] ) simplifies further + ( uk_0/2t_c)-2 i m @xmath89=0 . solving for @xmath90",
    ", we find x_0=0.31  , where we have restored units ( @xmath85 is measured in units of the lattice spacing @xmath91 and @xmath92 in units of @xmath93 ) .",
    "we note that @xmath86 , which means that the instability develops at an _ incommensurate _ wave number close to @xmath26 .",
    "the remaining equation ( [ instability_condition ] ) then becomes & & 2j(k_0,0,0)(0,k_0 ) = -2 ( j_z+2 j_(k_0/2))(0,k_0 ) & & = ||^2 @xmath94 & & 0.25 @xmath95 = 1 .",
    "here we have used the result for the spin velocity of the isotropic heisenberg spin 1/2 chain @xmath96 .",
    "let us first ignore the effects of the coupling @xmath13 between planes .",
    "this case would correspond to a situation where the coupling in @xmath52 direction is also frustrated , but much smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "the critical temperature and ordering wave number are then given by [ critical_temperature ] t_c & & ( -2.60(j_/j_)^2 )  , +    \\(j_{\\parallel}/j_\\perp $ ] ^2  .",
    "[ k0 ]    these clearly show that the instability due to the frustrated interchain coupling is _",
    "extremely weak_. firstly , the critical temperature is orders of magnitude lower than its counterpart for the square lattice .",
    "this is an indication how weak the tendency to order is on a frustrated lattice . even for a large interchain coupling @xmath97 ,",
    "the critical temperature is only @xmath98 k. the ordering wave number is similarly small .",
    "our results should be compared to the zero - temperature results for the ordering wave number of @xcite and of @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite used linked - cluster expansion methods to study ground state properties and excited states at zero temperature of a rather general frustrated model , which contains the anisotropic triangular lattice as a special case .",
    "they obtain numerically ( in their notations our antiferromagnetic wave number corresponds to @xmath99 ) @xmath100 which yields a much larger incommensuration than our result . in @xcite a heisenberg model on an anisotropic triangular lattice was studied by enlarging the spin - rotational symmetry group from su(2 ) to sp(n ) and then carrying out a large - n expansion .",
    "it was concluded that for weak @xmath101 there is no incommensuration at all .",
    "given the approximate nature of our results , they are certainly compatible with such a scenario .    in our approach the instability in the su(2 ) invariant case is actually caused by the marginally irrelevant current - current interaction that gives rise to logarithmic corrections .",
    "the weakness of the instability is due to the fact that it is caused by precisely these logarithmic corrections .      in the general case",
    "@xmath102 it is not possible to obtain simple analytic expressions like ( [ critical_temperature ] ) and ( [ k0 ] ) for @xmath1 and @xmath85 respectively and we have to resort to a numerical solution of ( [ instability_condition ] ) and ( [ extremum ] )",

    "in this work we have studied the dynamical response of frustrated quasi-1d spin-1/2 heisenberg magnets in the disordered phase .",
    "the starting point of our approach are exact results for the finite - temperature dynamical susceptibility of an ensemble of uncoupled chains . taking the couplings between chains into account within the framework of a random phase approximation",
    ", we obtained an analytic expression for the dynamical structure factor of the quasi-1d system we are interested in . in the disordered phase",
    "the main effects of the frustration are to generate an _ asymmetry _ of the line shape and a shift of the apparent dispersion to an incommensurate wave vector .    by analyzing the instability of the disordered phase with respect to the formation of collective modes we studied the transition to the low - temperature ordered phase . in particular we determined the ordering temperature and ordering wave vector within the framework of our approach .",
    "we found that there is a very weak instability towards an incommensurately ordered state .",
    "we then considered the effects of an applied magnetic field .",
    "we found that for isotropic heisenberg magnets application of a magnetic field leads first to an increase in the transition temperature @xmath103 and for very large field to an eventual decrease . in the presence of an exchange anisotropy we found two distinct behaviours :",
    "if the field is applied along the direction of the anisotropy the situation is very similar to the isotropic case .",
    "applying the field at an angle to the anisotropy generates a gap in the individual chains , which leads to a decrease of @xmath103 with @xmath104 in the quasi-1d system .",
    "this type of magnetic phase diagram is qualitatively similar to what has been observed in @xmath105 .    in the second part of this work we took into account the effects of various types of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interactions , which break spin rotational invariance .",
    "we first considered dm interactions involving spins along the chain directions and then dm interactions involving spins along interchain bonds . in the disordered phase the main effect of dm interactions",
    "is to generate stronger incommensurations .",
    "dm interactions also leads to a significant enhancement in the transition temperature and ordering wave number .    in general",
    "our results are qualitatively similar to what is observed experimentally in @xmath14 . in presence of a dm interaction of the kind proposed in @xcite for @xmath14",
    "we obtain a transition temperature and ordering wave number , which are close to the experimental values .",
    "however , given that the interchain coupling is not small it is unclear how reliable the rpa approach is . in light of this fact it would be very interesting to determine the leading corrections to rpa , which can be done for example along the lines of @xcite .",
    "it also would be interesting to extend the coupled chains approach to the ordered phase .",
