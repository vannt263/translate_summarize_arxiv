    "many features of granular gases are captured by an idealized system of smooth , hard spheres with inelastic collisions @xcite . during the past decade",
    "considerable attention has been given to this simple system to understand better the mechanisms behind observed qualitative differences between real gases and those comprised of grains . among the most productive theoretical tools for analysis used",
    "is that of kinetic theory @xcite , and more specifically at low density , the boltzmann equation gys95,dufty . in recent years important conceptual issues , such as the applicability of fluid dynamical equations , have been clarified and quantitative methods have been developed for accurate predictions over a wide range of experimental conditions .",
    "it is fair to say that the boltzmann kinetic theory is now the primary theoretical method for a quantitative description of granular gases .    while there are accurate and efficient numerical algorithms for solving the boltzmann equation @xcite , analytic approximations are more limited and exact solutions non - existent .",
    "such analytic results are of considerable interest because they complement numerical solutions with a more penetrating explication of the dominant mechanisms involved in a specific application .",
    "the mathematical complexity of the boltzmann collision operator is the limiting factor in making progress , so simpler  kinetic models  have been proposed @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used with great success for real gases with elastic collisions where several exact solutions far from equilibrium have been obtained and shown to be in semi - quantitative agreement with the numerical  simulations of the  boltzmann equation dufty90,santosbook .",
    "recent applications of kinetic models to granular gases have yielded similar interesting exact results brey00model , brey97shear , tij01 .",
    "the collision operator for a kinetic model is constrained to preserve the most important exact properties of the boltzmann collision operator , such as a special homogeneous solution and the macroscopic balance equations for mass , momentum , and energy .",
    "otherwise , the model is chosen for simplicity and tractability .",
    "the objective here is to recall one of the first kinetic models proposed for granular gases , the bmd model @xcite , and to generalize it for both a qualitative and a quantitative representation of the boltzmann equation .",
    "it will be referred to as the gaussian model for reasons that will become apparent .    in the following sections the gaussian model is defined and applied to the simplest cases of homogeneous states and weak spatial perturbations of those states .",
    "the motivation for this work is to provide a tool for a subsequent more detailed study of spatially inhomogeneous states .",
    "for example , recent results suggest that the spectrum of the linearized collision operator for a realistic kinetic model could shed important light on the validity conditions for a hydrodynamic description @xcite . also , a more practical means to describe boundary value problems is desired for a more faithful comparison with experiments .",
    "attention is focused here on spatially homogeneous states for an isolated system and on transport coefficients for small spatial perturbations , as a means to compare and contrast models . a more detailed application to inhomogeneous states and",
    "shear flow will be presented elsewhere .",
    "there is extensive current interest in related maxwell models .",
    "several exact results have been obtained recently for the homogeneous state of an isolated system using these models @xcite . in some mathematical respects the maxwell models are closer to the hard sphere boltzmann collision operator than the model studied here . however , its predictions ( e.g. , homogeneous cooling state distribution , transport coefficients ) are quite different from those of the boltzmann equation as recounted below . in contrast , the gaussian  model is structurally simpler but with the capacity to give a better representation of known results for the boltzmann equation .",
    "the basic results known for the hard sphere boltzmann equation are summarized in the next section .",
    "the ideas of kinetic modeling and some existing models are reviewed briefly in section 3 , and the gaussian model is defined in section 4 .",
    "it is an extension and synthesis of two earlier models , the ellipsoidal statistical ( es ) model @xcite introduced for gases with elastic collisions to yield the correct prandtl number , and the bmd model noted above for inelastic collisions .",
    "the new model is constructed to describe both elastic and inelastic collisions , retain a realistic velocity dependent collision frequency , and to yield the correct prandtl number for accurate transport coefficients .",
    "also in section 4 , the exact solution to the gaussian model is obtained for an arbitrary initial homogeneous state .",
    "it is shown that this class of solutions approaches a universal hcs solution on a time scale of the order of several collisions .",
    "hence the hcs is the special state for homogeneous granular gases analogous to the maxwellian for normal gases .",
    "the properties of the hcs distribution are shown to be similar to those for the boltzmann equation at both small and large velocities .",
    "in particular similar exponential decay occurs at large velocities .",
    "the special case of a velocity independent collision frequency is studied as well . in that case",
    "the hcs is the same as that for the bmd model .",
    "the maxwell models also have a velocity independent collision frequency . in this special case gaussian model hcs has properties quite similar to those of the maxwell models , including algebraic decay for large velocities .",
    "the chapman - enskog solution to the boltzmann equation for small spatial variations around the local hcs applies for the models as well . to navier - stokes order",
    "this solution is characterized by three transport coefficients .",
    "these transport coefficients are compared for the various models and the boltzmann equation in section 5 .",
    "the gaussian model with velocity dependent collision frequency provides an excellent representation of the hard sphere boltzmann results , over a wide range of inelasticity .",
    "the hcs is the reference state for linear hydrodynamics .",
    "consequently , knowledge of the exact form of this distribution function from the kinetic models provides some additional insight there as well .",
    "this is illustrated in section 6 where the velocity dependence of the hydrodynamic modes bdyr03,dyb03 is calculated .",
    "the relationship of these modes to the fluxes in green - kubo expressions for transport coefficients is also noted .",
    "finally , the results presented here are summarized in the last section and some other interesting applications of the kinetic model are suggested .",
    "the system considered is composed of @xmath0 smooth hard spheres of diameter @xmath1 in a large volume @xmath2 .",
    "if the density is sufficiently small , @xmath3 , the one - particle distribution function , @xmath4 , for the number of particles with position @xmath5 and velocity @xmath6 at time @xmath7 is determined from the boltzmann equation gys95,dufty @xmath8the boltzmann collision operator , @xmath9 , has the form @xmath10the first term on the right side represents the loss of particles with velocity @xmath11 at a rate due to the collision frequency @xmath12 @xmath13the second term of ( [ 2.2 ] ) represents the gain of particles with velocity @xmath11 , where @xmath14 are the  restituting  velocities that lead to @xmath15 following a smooth , inelastic hard sphere collision @xmath16here , @xmath17 is a unit vector along the line of their centers , and @xmath18 .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 is the coefficient of restitution , @xmath20 , describing the fractional change in the normal component of the relative velocity ( @xmath21 ) and hence the inelasticity of collisions ( @xmath22 corresponds to elastic collisions .",
    "the kernel @xmath23 is proportional to the flux of particles times the differential cross section and is given by @xmath24where @xmath25 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the most important properties of the collision operator are those that result from the microscopic balance equations for mass , momentum , and energy in a two particle collision . for the collision rules ( [ 2.3 ] ) it follows directly that @xmath9 has the following exact properties @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass , @xmath28 is the density@xmath29 is the temperature@xmath30 and @xmath31 is the macroscopic flow velocity @xmath32 the two zeros on the right side of ( [ 2.4 ] ) correspond to conservation of mass and momentum .",
    "the last term results from non - conservation of energy and implies the cooling equation for homogeneous states @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the  cooling rate ",
    "@xmath35    it is easy to verify from ( [ 2.4 ] ) that there is no spatially homogeneous steady state for the isolated system , in contrast to gases with elastic collisions .",
    "instead , there exists a special solution , the homogeneous cooling solution ( hcs ) , which is assumed to be approached in a few collision times by all homogeneous initial conditions .",
    "it has a scaling property such that the dependence on time occurs only through the temperature @xmath36 in the following @xmath37 will be referred to as the thermal velocity in analogy to a gas with elastic collisions .",
    "substitution of ( [ 2.6 ] ) into the boltzmann equation leads to a time independent equation for @xmath38 that must be solved self - consistently with the determination of @xmath34 from ( [ 2.5 ] ) @xmath39where @xmath40 is an average collision frequency @xmath41because of the scaling property of @xmath42 both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are independent of time .",

    "@xmath19 has been confirmed by monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "the cooling rate calculated from ( [ 2.7 ] ) is @xcite @xmath51 for asymptotically large velocities @xmath52 has a qualitatively different behavior @xcite @xmath53 the constant @xmath54 arises in the large velocity limit of the collision frequency , @xmath55 thus the origin of the exponential decay is the asymptotic velocity dependence of the collision frequency .",
    "the over population in the tail of the distribution , relative to the gaussian at small velocities , also has been confirmed for @xmath56 for all @xmath19 by monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "these and the transport properties of section 5 are the primary results known for the boltzmann equation with inelastic collisions .",
    "they are the main features captured by the kinetic model proposed here .",
    "it is remarkable that over a century after boltzmann wrote his kinetic equation for a low density gas , the content of that equation remains masked by its complexity .",
    "certainly , a great deal is known about solutions near the equilibrium state but the mechanisms controlling nonlinear transport far from equilibrium are still poorly understood .",
    "significant progress has been made in the past twenty years with the development of direct simulation monte carlo methods ( dsmc ) by bird @xcite .",
    "this numerical tool is exceptionally powerful and provides access now to a wide range of nonequlibrium states for both elastic and inelastic collisions . for more detailed analytical insight ,",
    "kinetic models have provided a parallel powerful tool in rarefied gas dynamics .",
    "the objective of this section is to give a brief summary of the concept of kinetic models and their extension to inelastic collisions .",
    "although the discussion is limited to the boltzmann equation , it is noted that the same ideas have been applied as well to its dense fluid generalization , the enskog kinetic equation , for both fluids and solids@xcite .",
    "the results quoted in the previous section for the hcs are accurate but not exact . to obtain a more penetrating investigation of this and other solutions",
    "a simplified version of the boltzmann equation called the maxwell model has been proposed @xcite whereby the kernel @xmath57 is replaced by a velocity independent kernel @xmath58.then ( [ 2.2b ] ) implies that the collision frequency also is independent of the velocity , @xmath59 .",

    "this requires the choice @xmath66 where @xmath40 is given by ( [ 2.6b ] ) .",
    "this completely fixes the maxwell model .",
    "the approximate maxwell form for the boltzmann collision operator does not represent any real kinetics due to scattering by a potential .",
    "it is called a maxwell model because the property of @xmath67 being independent of the velocity follows for scattering by maxwell molecules interacting via an inverse fourth power law potential . however , the model described here retains the collision rules for inelastic hard spheres , ( [ 2.3 ] ) , and therefore is a hybrid not corresponding to any potential .",
    "still , it provides an interesting and tractable model for which several exact results have been obtained recently .",
    "the hcs has been studied for this maxwell  model as well . for small velocities @xmath52 again has the form of ( [ 2.7 ] ) except that the coefficient @xmath68 is replaced by @xcite @xmath69 this is significantly different from the small velocity dependence of the hard sphere boltzmann equation , suggesting that the maxwell model does not reproduce quantitatively the hcs solution for hard spheres .",
    "furthermore , the difference is even qualitative at larger velocities .",
    "the exact asymptotic behavior from the maxwell model is @xmath70 thus there is algebraic decay for the maxwell model in contrast to the exponential decay for hard spheres .",
    "the exponent @xmath71 is the solution to a transcendental equation @xcite @xmath72 the behavior of @xmath73 and @xmath71 is illustrated in the next section .",
    "the transport coefficients associated with navier - stokes hydrodynamics also have been calculated for the maxwell model@xcite .",
    "the agreement with those from the boltzmann equation for  hard spheres is only qualitative ( see section 5 ) .",
    "while the maxwell model allows interesting and exact solutions , it does not appear to provide a reliable representation of the boltzmann equation for  hard spheres and therefore the results obtained from it must be interpreted with some care .      the maxwell model ,",
    "while simpler than the boltzmann equation is still quite complex and even for the hcs the exact distribution function has been calculated only in one dimension .",
    "historically , for normal gases , a number of simpler kinetic models have been applied with great success .",
    "more recently , these models have been extended to granular gases with a similar success in applications .",
    "to explain them generically , it is useful to rewrite the boltzmann equation ( [ 2.1 ] ) to make the effects of cooling explicit @xcite @xmath74 ,   \\label{3.1}\\ ] ] with @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the velocity relative to the average flow . then the condition ( [ 2.4 ] ) becomes @xmath77 in addition , there is a null space for @xmath78 ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) are the same as those for the conservation laws and the equilibrium state , respectively , for elastic collisions",
    ". more generally , ( [ 3.4 ] ) defines the hcs in agreement with ( [ 2.6a ] ) .",
    "these two sets of conditions are necessary for the macroscopic balance equations ( precursors to hydrodynamics ) and the  universal  homogeneous state @xmath79 . the basic idea of kinetic models is to replace the actual boltzmann collision operator by a simpler structure , while preserving the properties ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "there are many ways that a kinetic model can  be constructed with these constraints .",
    "perhaps the simplest are the bgk model(s)@xcite @xmath80 clearly , ( [ 3.4 ] ) is satisfied and the conditions ( [ 3.3 ] ) are imposed by requiring that the relevant moments of @xmath81 and @xmath79 should be the same @xmath82 this implies that @xmath79 is a functional of @xmath81 so the apparent simplicity of ( [ 3.5 ] ) is misleading . for elastic collisions @xmath79",
    "is taken to be the local maxwellian for consistency with the known equilibrium state . in the case of inelastic collisions",
    ", it would seem appropriate to choose @xmath79 as the hcs distribution from the boltzmann equation .",
    "however , since this is not known it is more common to choose again @xmath79 as the local maxwellian .",
    "as described in the previous section , this is a reasonable first approximation to the hcs if the velocities are not too large .",
    "however , it precludes use of the kinetic model to study the hcs itself .",
    "the collision frequency @xmath83 is a free parameter of the model , usually chosen to fit one of the transport coefficients . on dimensional grounds @xmath84 and therefore also a functional of @xmath81 .",
    "the chapman - enskog solution to the bgk kinetic equation for inelastic collisions has been obtained to derive the associated hydrodynamic equations to navier - stokes order ( see section 5 ) @xcite .",
    "the dependence of all transport coefficients on the restitution coefficient @xmath19 is in good semi - quantitative agreement with that for the boltzmann equation .",
    "however , the model suffers from the same well - known  problem for elastic collisions of an incorrect prandtl number @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the specific heat per unit mass , @xmath87 is the shear viscosity and @xmath88 is the thermal conductivity .",
    "since the bgk model has only one parameter @xmath89 the absolute value of either the shear viscosity or the thermal conductivity is wrong by a factor of approximately 2/3 .",
    "this can be corrected by choosing for @xmath79 a more general gaussian , with an additional parameter leading to the es model for elastic collisions @xcite .",
    "bgk models of this type for granular gases have been discussed recently by astillero and santos @xcite .    a related but different kinetic model attempts to represent more directly the gain term of the boltzmann collision operator @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ 2.2 ] ) is written as @xmath90the gain functional @xmath91 is now chosen for convenience and simplicity to  define the model , but restricted by the exact conditions ( [ 3.3 ] ) and ( [ 3.4 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the bgk model , the condition ( [ 3.4 ] ) now provides an equation that determines a non - trivial hcs solution .",
    "the simplest choice for @xmath91 is again a maxwellian , but with the temperature modified to account for the extra term on the right side of ( 3.7 ) . for simplicity",
    ", applications of this kinetic model to date have also chosen a velocity independent collision frequency . in the limit of elastic collisions it reduces to the bgk model .",
    "the hcs solution can be obtained exactly for this model and , like the maxwell model , it has algebraic rather than exponential decay at large velocities .",
    "the transport coefficients for this second model are of comparable accuracy to those from the bgk model and suffer from the same difficulty of an incorrect prandtl number . in the next section the kinetic model based on ( [ 3.7 ] ) is generalized to include a velocity dependent collision frequency and a gaussian form for @xmath92 that can accommodate the correct prandtl number .",
    "the main objective of the present work is to propose a synthesis of the bmd and es models and to extend them to include a velocity dependent collision frequency .",
    "this will be referred to as the gaussian model .",
    "like the maxwell model , the gaussian model admits exact analysis in many interesting cases , but it is simpler and captures more accurately the qualitative features of the boltzmann equation . in this section the model is defined and the initial value problem is solved exactly for spatially homogeneous states .",
    "it is shown that all initial states rapidly approach a universal hcs .",
    "the hcs is then studied and compared with known results for the boltzmann equation for hard spheres . finally , it is specialized to the case of a velocity independent collision frequency , for comparison with the hcs for the maxwell model .",
    "the model is defined by the choice of a gaussian for @xmath93 in ( [ 3.7 ] ) @xcite @xmath94 @xmath95 the scalar function @xmath96 and symmetric tensor @xmath97 are determined in part by the conditions ( [ 2.4a ] ) @xmath98 where @xmath99 are moments of the distribution function , weighted by the collision frequency @xmath100 the choice of a gaussian is primarily for convenience and simplicity .",
    "however , it can be understood also as the result from information theory to determine a function when only the moments in ( [ 4.2 ] ) are specified ( see appendix a ) .",
    "it follows directly that    @xmath101    for the special case of constant collision frequency  these become @xmath102 so the coefficients of the gaussian are related to the density , temperature , and flow velocity .",
    "this also illustrates that the elements of @xmath48 are not fully determined by the moment conditions ( [ 4.2 ] ) .",
    "it is useful to divide the matrix @xmath103 into a part proportional to the unit matrix plus a traceless part @xmath104 in the following a tilde above a  matrix will be used to denote its traceless part .",
    "the special case of ( [ 4.6 ] ) shows that the trace of @xmath103 is proportional to the temperature and therefore a linear functional of @xmath105 .",
    "it is reasonable to choose the remaining elements of @xmath103 also to have a linear relationship to @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , it is required that this traceless part should vanish at @xmath79 , the solution to ( [ 3.4 ] ) , which should be isotropic ( to agree with the boltzmann equation ) @xmath106 thus , the gain @xmath91 is anisotropic only when evaluated for anisotropic states @xmath81.this is an implicit definition since @xmath79 is a function of @xmath103",
    ". however , the form is such that @xmath103 becomes diagonal when evaluated for @xmath107 , and hence so does @xmath108 .",
    "this assures that @xmath79 , when it exists , is isotropic .",
    "the trace of @xmath103 is a scalar moment of degree 2 ( including the weight factor @xmath109 ) when @xmath110 .",
    "consequently , it is suggestive to take @xmath111 as the traceless part of the moment of degree 2 of @xmath112 .",
    "the final form for @xmath103 is then @xmath113 where @xmath114 is an undetermined dimensionless quantity independent of the velocity",
    ". the conditions ( [ 4.2 ] ) and ( [ 4.8 ] ) completely determine the parameters @xmath115 .",
    "it remains to choose the collision frequency @xmath116 and the cooling rate @xmath117 . in principle , these are specific functionals of @xmath81 in the boltzmann equation .",
    "here , they are taken to depend on @xmath81 only through the temperature and density .",
    "the cooling rate is chosen to be the same as the boltzmann result ( [ 2.10 ] )    @xmath118    @xmath119    similarly , guidance for the choice of the velocity dependent collision frequency @xmath120 is obtained from that for the boltzmann ( see eq([2.2b ] ) ) @xmath121 for small @xmath122 this goes to a constant , @xmath123 while for large @xmath124 it becomes linear in @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath125    a representation of the complete velocity dependence for the gaussian model , preserving these limiting forms is obtained from ( [ 4.24 ] ) using a maxwellian for @xmath81@xmath126 .",
    "\\label{4.26}\\]]here @xmath127 is a second undetermined dimensionless constant .",
    "the particular choice for @xmath128 and the resulting accuracy of the transport coefficients is discussed in the next section .",
    "it is found that @xmath129 is a smooth function of @xmath19 of order unity .",
    "this form for @xmath130 has the correct large velocity dependence of ( [ 2.12 ] ) but with the coefficient differing by a factor of @xmath127 from the boltzmann equation .    at this point",
    "the gaussian model has been specified in terms of the two remaining constants @xmath127 and @xmath131 . in the next section",
    "it will be shown that the three transport coefficients at navier - stokes order are functions of two independent collision integrals .",
    "the constants @xmath127 and @xmath131 are chosen to assure that these two collision integrals are the same as those from the boltzmann equation .",
    "this leads to a coupled pair of equations ( ( [ 5.15d ] ) and ( [ 5.15c ] ) below ) that are solved numerically .",
    "this completes the definition of the gaussian model .",
    "in the rest of this section , attention is restricted to spatially homogeneous states .",
    "it is shown that for any arbitrary homogeneous initial condition , the solution goes over to a universal hcs in a few collision times . for these initial conditions",
    "@xmath132 is constant and by a galilean transformation it is possible to choose @xmath133 . also from the continuity equation",
    "@xmath134 is constant .",
    "the temperature obeys the cooling equation ( [ 2.4c ] ) which is now written @xmath135 the new time variable @xmath136 represents the average number of collisions in the time @xmath7 .",
    "it also follows from the definition of @xmath137 that @xmath138 is constant .",
    "the temperature therefore has a simple exponential dependence on the collision number @xmath139    now consider a general homogeneous initial distribution and look for solutions to the model kinetic equation in the dimensionless form @xmath140the dimensionless form for the model kinetic equation for homogeneous states becomes @xmath141with @xmath142the moment @xmath143 vanishes since @xmath144 .",

    "this gives the inequality @xmath154 since @xmath155 is of order unity , the domain of integration in  ( [ 4.78 ] ) is exponentially bounded for @xmath156 and for large @xmath136 the integral becomes independent of @xmath136 .",
    "the first term vanishes exponentially fast and the @xmath136 independent hcs solution is obtained @xmath157 it is readily verified that @xmath158 is a stationary solution to ( [ 4.75 ] ) and hence @xmath159 is the unique hcs solution .",
    "it follows from the definition of @xmath48 that this distribution becomes isotropic on the same time scale as ( [ 4.79 ] ) even if the initial distribution was not @xmath160    for the class of homogeneous initial states considered , this result shows that the hcs is the universal solution after several collisions .",
    "hence it is the special characteristic solution for homogenous states analogous to the maxwellian for elastic collisions .",
    "the result ( 4.81 ) is stronger than the h - theorem for elastic collisions in the sense that it implies the approach to the hcs is pointwise in velocity space .",
    "it is interesting to observe that this analysis does not require the explicit form for @xmath161 and so it applies to models with choices other than the gaussian .",
    "in fact , it applies to the boltzmann equation itself although in that case ( [ 4.81 ] ) is a more implicit functional relationship whose solution must be proved .",
    "the consistency of the moment conditions ( [ 4.77 ] ) and ( [ 4.77a ] ) is verified in appendix c using the explicit form ( 4.81 ) .",
    "the functions @xmath162 and @xmath163 are fixed by the fact that @xmath164 and @xmath165 the explicit forms for these equations also are given in appendix c.      more explicit properties of the hcs are easily obtained.first , it can be written in the more convenient form @xmath166the coefficients @xmath167 and @xmath168 are determined from ( [ 4.82 ] ) .",

    "it is seen that the polynomial expansion follows the exact hcs closely and is close to the expansion using @xmath188 the polynomial expansion using @xmath49 is very close to the actual distribution obtained by monte carlo simulation of the boltzmann equation for @xmath189 .",
    "therefore the model gives a good representation of the boltzmann distribution for @xmath190 .",

    "the distribution function becomes @xmath199this is not yet the exponential decay quoted in ( [ 2.12 ] ) for the boltzmann equation .",
    "instead , that exponential decay requires a still larger velocity scale due to the slow approach of @xmath200 in ( [ 4.30c ] ) to its large @xmath201 limiting form @xmath202where @xmath203 is the coefficient of the large velocity limit for the collision frequency given in ( [ 2.12c ] ) .",
    "thus ( 4.30c ) behaves as @xmath204 the dominant exponential decay is the same as that for the boltzmann equation , ( [ 2.12 ] ) , with only the coefficient @xmath205 changed to @xmath206 .",
    "in fact , a similar analysis of the derivation of that result for the boltzmann equation shows that the same intermediate velocity form ( [ 4.31 ] ) applies there as well ( with @xmath207 ) .",
    "the cross over to pure exponential decay requires very large velocities . in practical terms for @xmath208",
    "this form holds to within @xmath209 for @xmath210 whereas the exponential decay has the same accuracy only for much larger velocities .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 for @xmath208 .",
    "the derivative of the logarithm of the distribution is plotted so that the initial slope for small velocities is near the maxwellian value @xmath211 , while the asymptotic large velocity value is the constant coefficient of the exponential decay @xmath212 shown as a dotted line .",
    "the intermediate cross over is seen to be governed by the asymptotic form ( [ 4.30c ] ) @xmath213 figure 3 also shows that this more general form persists to very large velocities before the final exponential decay is attained .",
    "this cross over form is expected to apply for the boltzmann equation as well and should be taken into account in simulation or experimental attempts to measure the over population at large velocities .    to explore the limiting form for @xmath214",
    "it is useful to integrate by parts in ( [ 4.27 ] ) to get    @xmath215    the second term on the right side vanishes at @xmath171 leaving the expected maxwellian . for @xmath216",
    "the second term gives the exponential decay at large velocities . in order to dominate the first term it is necessary that @xmath217 since the coefficient in the exponential decay is proportional to @xmath218 the relevant domain for overpopulation is @xmath219 .",
    "clearly for @xmath220 this overpopulation becomes physically insignificant .    in summary",
    ", it has been shown that all of the qualitative features of the hcs for the hard sphere boltzmann equation are reproduced by the gaussian model . in the next section",
    "it is shown that this quality of the model extends to transport properties as well .      to emphasize the effects of the velocity dependence of the collision frequency , it is instructive to consider the same gaussian model with a velocity independent collision frequency , @xmath221 .",
    "the hcs for the gaussian model then reduces to that of the bmd model .",
    "the single parameter of the model , the constant collision frequency , can be chosen to fit the shear viscosity or the thermal conductivity . due to the choice of @xmath129 made here the model",

    "its relationship to @xmath233 is fixed by the choices of cooling rate and collision frequency @xmath234    for small velocities the representation ( [ 2.7 ] ) applies with @xmath235 given by @xmath236figure 1 shows a comparison of the coefficient @xmath237 with that for the maxwell model given by ( [ 2.16 ] ) .",
    "they are seen to be similar for weak dissipation but the gaussian model grows more rapidly with increasing dissipation .",
    "of course , this difference can be eliminated by a different choice of the parameters for the gaussian model for a closer agreement to the maxwell model rather than the hard sphere boltzmann equation .",
    "the accuracy of this polynomial representation is within a few percent for relatively weak dissipation , comparable to that observed for the hard sphere boltzmann equation .",
    "it is clear from this figure that the hcs for models with velocity independent collision frequencies differs from that of the boltzmann equation and the true gaussian model at small velocities ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "also , at small velocities , the hcs in ( [ 4.90 ] ) can be represented as a gaussian given by @xmath238    the asymptotic behavior for large velocities is obtained from ( [ 4.17 ] ) using the limiting form for the incomplete gamma function @xmath239this algebraic decay is similar to that of the maxwell model , and in contrast to the exponential decay for the hard sphere boltzmann equation .",
    "this difference is due to neglect of the velocity dependence of the collision frequency in both models . since the exact solution to the gaussian model",
    "is known the crossover from gaussian to algebraic forms can be determined explicitly .",
    "figure 4 illustrates this for @xmath208 .",
    "the cross over domain occurs for @xmath240 , increasing slightly with decreasing @xmath19 , with no special intermediate behavior .",
    "figure 5 shows a comparison of the exponent for the algebraic decay for the gaussian model , @xmath241 , with the corresponding result for the maxwell model obtained from the solution to ( [ 2.18 ] ) . near @xmath242",
    "both exponents diverge as @xmath243 but with different coefficients .    in summary ,",
    "the simple gaussian model with constant collision frequency captures semi - quantitatively all of the relevant features of the maxwell model .",
    "it has the additional feature of demonstrating explicitly the solution for all homogeneous states to show the rapid transition to the homogeneous cooling state , and the detailed features of that state .",
    "the algebraic decay at large velocities implies divergence of moments of degree greater than some critical value for given @xmath19 .",
    "the evolution of such moments for given initial states can be studied in detail to characterize the growing over population of large velocities in the hcs .",

    "finally , these latter expressions are evaluated for the model and compared with the corresponding results for the boltzmann equation .      the hydrodynamic equations for spatially inhomogeneous states are obtained from a special solution to the kinetic equation generated by the chapman - enskog method .",
    "the method is quite general and requires only the properties ( [ 2.4 ] ) for the collision operator . since these are preserved in the maxwell and gaussian models the results obtained earlier for the boltzmann equation @xcite apply for the models as well .",

    "it is also shown here that the gaussian model for constant collision frequency can be  tuned  to represent well the more complicated maxwell models .",
    "one motivation for the generalization of a kinetic model to include a velocity dependent collision frequency is a more accurate description of the overpopulation at large velocities for granular gases .",
    "the decrease of the distribution function for large velocities in the simplest state of hcs is algebraic for any model with a constant collision frequency , including the maxwell model .",
    "in contrast , the decay found from the hard sphere boltzmann equation is exponential due to the velocity dependence of the loss term in the collision operator",
    ". this qualitative difference may be important for driven states as well .",
    "although this asymptotic behavior occurs only for extremely large velocities it can have an effect on the moments of the distribution function .",
    "in addition it has been shown in section 6 that the hydrodynamic modes and the green - kubo fluxes depend on the log of the hcs distribution function , so this asymptotic behavior is even more important .",
    "the gaussian model with velocity dependent collision frequency incorporates this behavior and in addition gives a quite good quantitative representation of the hcs distribution function for small velocities as well .",
    "this is illustrated in fig 1 where @xmath379 shows significant improvement over the velocity independent case . as a consequence the transport coefficients @xmath380 and @xmath381",
    "are also significantly improved due to their dependence on @xmath379 .",
    "the second feature of a non - symmetric gaussian provides an additional parameter beyond the collision frequency that can be chosen to optimize the quality of all transport coefficients .",
    "here they are chosen such that the shear viscosity is accurate for both the constant collision frequency and the velocity dependent collision frequency for all values of the restitution coefficient .",
    "the other transport coefficients are accurate in the elastic limit , including the correct prandtl number for both cases . for inelastic collisions",
    "the agreement with boltzmann remains excellent for the velocity dependent collision frequency case for all @xmath339 .",
    "this is a primary improvement of the gaussian model .",
    "in contrast , the transport coefficients from the maxwell model are quite different from those of the hard sphere boltzmann equation , and the other kinetic models using a symmetric gaussian all give the wrong prandtl number .",
    "an advantage of most kinetic models is their structural simplicity .",
    "they can be solved exactly for many states as functionals of a few moments of the distribution .",
    "these moments still obey complicated nonlinear integral equations but the problem is simplified to the extent that exact results are often possible for states with sufficient symmetry .",
    "an example is given here for homogeneous states where the exact solution is obtained in terms of the parameters of the gaussian gain term , @xmath382 and @xmath383 which in turn are defined in terms of the moments @xmath384 .",
    "it is shown that an arbitrary homogeneous initial condition evolves after a few collisions to a universal scaling solution , the hcs .",
    "such behavior is expected also from the hard sphere boltzmann equation but its complexity has precluded a proof to date . it is useful also to have the explicit representation of the hcs for other purposes as well .",
    "here it has been noted that the hydrodynamic modes for weakly inhomogeneous states are described by eigenfunctions of the linearized boltzmann collision operator .",
    "these eigenfunctions are determined from the hcs and a contrast with the corresponding eigenfunctions for elastic collisions was made possible by the explicit results for the hcs for the kinetic model .",
    "significant differences are observed between the cases of the velocity independent and velocity dependent collision frequency , due to the qualitative differences in the large velocity dependences of the hcs .",
    "this is also related to the hilbert space for formulating the eigenvalue problem for the linearized kinetic equation .",
    "the natural scalar product is an integration over the velocities weighted by the hcs distribution function .",
    "due to the algebraic decay at large velocities for the constant collision frequency case ( including the maxwell model ) , polynomials of high degree do not exist in this space @xcite .",
    "this restriction does not occur for the hard sphere boltzmann equation or the gaussian model with velocity dependent collision frequency .",
    "it is of some interest to study any qualitative differences in the spectrum of the linearized collision operator and any consequences for the existence of hydrodynamics .",
    "the gaussian kinetic model provides a tractable context to address this issue .",
    "the most interesting states for experimental purposes are quasi - steady states for systems driven at the boundaries . for states of high spatial symmetry",
    "the kinetic model again offers the advantage of an exact solution as a functional of low degree moments .",
    "an example is that of uniform shear flow where an exact solution for the distribution function has been obtained in the case of a symmetric gaussian @xcite .",
    "the result applies even for large shear rates so the rheology of states far from equilibrium can be studied directly .",
    "the gaussian model described here also can be solved exactly for uniform shear flow and will be given elsewhere .",
    "vibrated systems , with and without gravity , have been studied on the basis of the boltzmann equation using monte carlo simulation methods leading to a number of important results bearing on experiments ( e.g. , boundary layers @xcite , dependence of velocity distribution on the distance from the driving wall @xcite , symmetry breaking @xcite ) .",
    "the gaussian kinetic model may be simple enough for a complementary analytical study of such problems .    in summary ,",
    "the work here has extended earlier kinetic models to bring closer correspondence with the boltzmann equation for the hcs and small spatial perturbations of that state .",
    "the price for these improvements is an increased complexity of the model , although this has not been an impediment for the simple states considered here .",
