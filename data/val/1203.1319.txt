    "systems of interacting galaxies have long been known to contain some very irregular structures such as rings , bridges , plumes , and tidal tails ( see @xcite for a review ) . in recent years , tidal dwarf galaxies ( tdgs )",
    "have also been recognized as byproducts of collisions between massive galaxies , identified by regions of active star formation and reservoirs of cold gas ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "simulations show that they consist of baryonic material stripped from the outer disks of interacting gas - rich parent galaxies @xcite .",
    "tdgs are believed to form stars through gas instabilities and collapsing  clouds , and contain little to no dark matter @xcite . in general , tdgs appear to fall into one of two categories based on their stellar population : those dominated by old stars ripped from their parent galaxies , and those that consist almost exclusively of new stars forming from the  gas that was stripped during the interaction @xcite .",
    "tidal features are interesting for several reasons .",
    "they reveal the history of galaxy interactions @xcite and they may be used to trace the underlying dark matter distribution of the group or cluster ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ultimate fate of tdgs is unknown , but due to their dearth of dark matter they should be minimally bound by self - gravity and therefore easily disrupted by further galaxy encounters .",
    "they provide a potential source for metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium @xcite as the material they contribute will have a similar metallicity to their already - evolved parent galaxy @xcite .",
    "they are also a proposed origin of intracluster light @xcite .",
    "finally , tdgs provide a laboratory for studies of star formation in low density environments which are not complicated by the dynamics of spiral galaxies @xcite .",
    "neutral hydrogen observations play a crucial role in identifying tdgs .",
    "the  gas in late - type galaxies typically extends far beyond the stellar disk ( e.g. @xcite ) , so it is easily disturbed or removed in gravitational encounters , revealing the kinematics of an interaction .",
    "numerical simulations have successfully reproduced the distribution of gaseous and stellar tidal debris in interacting systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a large fraction of this gas may fall back to the parent galaxy @xcite , but some portion of it is pulled out with stars . as a result , we observe gaseous debris among tidal streams , and tdgs typically contain their own reservoir of  gas out of which they are currently forming stars .",
    "instabilities in this gaseous component may be the driving factor in the formation of tdgs @xcite .",
    "the velocity dispersion of  may be used to estimate the dynamical mass and evaluate whether  density enhancements are gravitationally bound . however ,",
    "the  can be entangled in tidal material .",
    "co gas , which forms in - situ , may provide a more accurate estimate of the tdg structure @xcite .",
    "generally , tdgs are observed to be young systems which may be an indicator of their short lifetime @xcite or may be due to the difficulty in identifying older tdgs @xcite .",
    "however , they are also generally observed to be chemically evolved : tdgs contain higher metallicities than normal dwarf galaxies , up to approximately @xmath4 solar , and they are abundant in molecular gas as measured by co observations @xcite .",
    "thus , metallicity estimates are used to confirm that tdg material is similar to that of its putative parent galaxy while population synthesis modeling is used to show that the stellar ages are less than the age of the tidal feature to which they belong ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "how star formation proceeds in tdgs remains unknown and may provide valuable clues for how star formation occurs in general .",
    "@xcite find evidence that the star formation properties in intergalactic star forming regions are similar to that in spiral galaxies .",
    "however , other observations suggest that star formation in low density environments , such as in dwarf galaxies or the extreme outer disks of massive galaxies , may take place below classical star formation gas surface density thresholds put forth by @xcite and @xcite ( e.g. @xcite ) . further , scatter in the predicted star formation rates from uv , h@xmath5 , and 8.0 @xmath6 m observations in these low density environments is not understood , but may be a function of age , metallicity , gas content , dust content , or the stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "as dynamically simple systems with a range of metallicities , molecular gas , and dust content , dwarf and tidal dwarf galaxies may be good laboratories for shedding light on the mechanics of star formation .",
    "we serendipitously discovered a uv - bright intergalactic star forming region , which was previously unrecognized or unacknowledged in optical observations , while examining galex images of the edge - on galaxy ngc  4656 .",
    "we consider the object ( hereafter referred to as ngc  4656uv ) a strong candidate for tidal dwarf galaxy status .",
    "ngc  4656uv is a member of the loose ( total number of members @xmath76 ; @xcite ) galaxy group consisting primarily of two edge - on spiral galaxies , ngc  4656 and ngc  4631 , which are suspected to have had a strong interaction in the past .",
    "an  bridge discovered by @xcite extends between the two spirals suggesting gas has been stripped from ngc  4631 by its gravitational encounter with ngc  4656 .",
    "high resolution interferometric observations of the group resolve the bridge into multiple  `` fingers '' @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite notes that ngc  4656 contains evidence of a disturbed morphology resulting from a prior interaction , including non - circular motions and asymmetry . in the optical ,",
    "previous attention has been paid to the sharp bend at the northeast edge of ngc  4656 , a feature which gives the galaxy its distinct `` hockey stick '' appearance . @xcite",
    "used photometry to determine that the bend is a feature of the galaxy resulting from an interaction , as opposed to a background galaxy ( ngc  4657 ) .",
    "an ultra - faint h@xmath5 `` sheet '' has been detected between ngc  4656 and ngc  4631 @xcite , however ngc  4656uv is not detected in these observations .",
    "total intensity maps presented by @xcite show a density enhancement at the location of ngc  4656uv , however they suggest it is part of an  ring surrounding ngc  4656 and do not identify the gas as being distinct from the parent galaxy .",
    "while nearly invisible in the digitized sky survey and very close to detection limits in the red ( _ i , z _ ) sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) bands , galex observations easily reveal the tdg candidate .",
    "ngc  4656uv is located just to the northeast of ngc  4656 at @xmath8 @xmath9 ( j2000 ) with a center - to - center separation of @xmath711 kpc , assuming a distance of 7.2 mpc @xcite .",
    "ngc  4656 and ngc  4656uv are connected by a faint bridge of  gas and stars . at this distance ngc  4656uv",
    "is one of the most nearby examples of vigorous star formation occurring in an extreme , low density environment .    in this paper",
    "we present our investigation into the nature of this uv - bright tidal dwarf galaxy candidate through the accumulation of publicly available survey and archival data .",
    "we make the case that it is most likely a tidal dwarf galaxy created from an encounter between ngc  4656 and ngc  4631 , instead of a pre - existing , but highly rejuvenated , dwarf galaxy , or a tidal stream . the paper is organized as follows :",
    "we describe the archival data and our post - processing methods in  [ data ] , we present our results in  [ results ] and discuss their implications in  [ discussion ] .",
    "we end with concluding remarks in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "a plethora of survey and archival data exists on ngc  4656 and its companion candidate tdg across a broad wavelength regime , giving us nearly complete wavelength coverage from 2.01 kev to 21 cm .",
    "in addition to the discovery galex tiles , we obtained images from the sdss , two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , @xcite ) , infrared array camera ( irac ) and multi - band imaging photometer ( mips ) on the _ spitzer space telescope _ , and archival  observations from the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "rosat x - ray imaging of ngc  4656 includes the tdg candidate , however there is no hard or soft x - ray emission from ngc  4656uv down to the detection limits of the observation ( @xmath10 erg s@xmath1 ; figure 8 of @xcite ) .",
    "we retrieved archival vla data from the online national radio astronomy observatory science data archive .",
    "the observations consist of a single pointing in d - array taken on 18 december 1989 ( project code ar0215 ) .",
    "it is centered on the optically bright portion of the edge - on spiral galaxy , ngc  4656 ( @xmath11 @xmath12 , j2000 ) .",
    "the primary beam of the vla at l - band is half a degree in diameter , such that ngc  4656 and ngc  4656uv span nearly the full extent of the beam . the galaxy was observed for approximately six hours on source with a velocity resolution of 10.3  kms@xmath1 .",
    "we calibrated and imaged the data in aips using the standard procedures .",
    "the resulting data cube has an rms noise of 0.81 mjy beam@xmath1 channel@xmath1 . at 5@xmath13",
    ", we achieved a mass sensitivity of @xmath14 m@xmath15 channel@xmath1 and a column density of @xmath16 @xmath17 channel@xmath1 .    the ngc  4631/ngc  4656 group of galaxies has been previously observed by @xcite and by @xcite , both with multiple pointings of the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) .",
    "the archival vla observations presented here are a single pointing focused on ngc  4656 and offer similar spectral and spatial resolution to the wsrt observations . however , the vla observations provide an improvement of 1.7 and 1.4 times the sensitivity compared to the @xcite and @xcite wsrt observations , respectively .",
    "we visually inspected all uv , optical , and infrared images to ensure that they were free from defects and contained both the main galaxy and the tdg candidate object .",
    "only about half of ngc  4656uv is on _ spitzer _ irac 4.5 and 8.0 @xmath6 m images , so we exclude those bands from photometry of the tdg candidate . to ensure complete and uniform coverage of the objects we downloaded image mosaics of the sdss and 2mass data using the montage mosaicking software .",
    "an initial list of sources were extracted using the source - extractor package @xcite .",
    "because sextractor is not optimized for nearby extended sources , we hand - edited catalogs to remove spurious / overlapping ellipses and add masking regions over unblanked stars and background galaxies . to ensure uniform processing of the images",
    ", the hand - edited catalogs were homogenized for galex , sdss , and mips bands . due to the high number of contaminant point sources in the irac frames , additional masking was done for those bands .",
    "these extra sources were not blanked in the other images to maximize the accuracy of the photometry . in all cases we chose to mask sources where we were unsure if they were contaminants .",
    "we photometered both ngc  4656 and ngc  4656uv .",
    "we set elliptical apertures around both objects , with sizes chosen to encompass all uv emission .",
    "we also photometered three separate regions of ngc  4656 , representing visually distinct areas of the galaxy . on the northeast side of ngc  4656 ( toward ngc  4656uv )",
    "the ` hook ' is a significant 90@xmath18 warp seen in images from the uv to the far - infrared .",
    "this feature , part of which is also known as ngc  4657 , appears very dense and blue .",
    "we separate the central portion of ngc  4656 as the ` main ' body .",
    "while there is no obvious bulge in ngc  4656 to denote the center of the system , this region has both the reddest optical colors and the highest surface - brightness of the galaxy .",
    "finally , we photometer the extended ` tail ' on the southwest side of ngc  4656 . the tail becomes very diffuse , and there is a color gradient along the major axis of the galaxy with the outermost regions of the tail becoming bluer . the exact shape and extent of the regions are shown in figure [ fig : regions ] and detailed in table [ tab : regions ] , while a color image of the system is shown in figure [ imagewcontours ] .",
    "we note that in figure [ fig : regions ] uv emission is visible further southwest than the end of the tail region ; this region is off the edge of the irac 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath6 m images , so we do not include this area in all bands to preserve the colors of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",

    "computing photometry for sources near the detection limit , as necessitated here for most filters , small background fluctuations can add significant systematic errors to the results .",
    "these background gradients are independent of the random errors used in our s / n thresholds and act to increase the true error in wavelength bands where an object has a small number of counts relative to the background level .    to combat this problem we fit and subtract polynomial surfaces to all images before they are photometered .",
    "generally when subtracting a background fit , we seek a solution that converges at large polynomial order .",
    "however , the commonly used scheme of masking sources tends to fail at high orders : restricting the location of points to perform the fit leads to poor surface subtraction in areas where a significant number of the pixels are masked , and increases errors overall when masks force non - optimal point selection ( especially for polynomial surface fits ) .",
    ", sdss @xmath19 , irac 3.6 @xmath6 m , and mips 70 @xmath6 m .",
    "green ellipses are the masking apertures used for the surface fits .",
    "all images have been rotated to north - up , east - left orientation and smoothed by a gaussian with @xmath13=6 pixels to highlight faint structure .",
    "our algorithm accurately fits the surface gradients for all of the images at high polynomial order , even for images with significant padding ( e.g. the fuv , 3.6 @xmath6 m , and 70 @xmath6 m images ) and/or large mask regions ( e.g. the @xmath20 and @xmath19 images ) . ]    to solve these problems we took an iterative approach to build surface fits that were both accurate and stable at high polynomial orders .",
    "we started by fitting a zeroth order lagrange polynomial ( a constant offset ) to the unmasked data using the iraf task _",
    "imsurfit_. this fit is minimally sensitive to extended sources on the image .",
    "we replaced the pixel values of all masked regions by the value of the fitted zeroth order background and the resulting image is run through imsurfit with order = 1 .",
    "this process is repeated while increasing the polynomial order until the change in the surface fit between orders asymptotes to a minimum value , which we find happens after 8 orders for most images ( although for the 2mass h - band we go to 19th order due to the larger variations in the sky background in that bandpass ) .    for the galex , sdss , and 2mass images ,",
    "the change between polynomial orders asymptotes at @xmath210.05% .",
    "because the irac and mips mosaics are not perfectly rectangular our algorithm s performance is not as good , with variations @xmath211.5% , although we note that the largest variations are confined to the corners of these images and that the surface fit generally has less variation in the central parts of the mosaic .",
    "as figure [ fig : skysubcompare ] shows , our method is robust regardless of the fitting order .",
    "while our method is a large improvement over non - iterative fits , there are still limitations to surface - removal . when the surface gradients are variable over scales comparable to the objects to be photometered , it is impossible to accurately subtract them without also subtracting the object .",
    "fortunately in most of our images the gradients are on large scales and/or both ngc  4656uv and all parts of ngc  4656 have significantly higher counts than the background fluctuations",
    ". however , there are two exceptions to this which will be discussed further in  [ sf ] and  [ galev ] .",
    "we present our results from archival and survey observations in two parts .",
    "first , we present the vla 21 cm observations and evidence from the cold neutral  gas that ngc  4656/ngc  4656uv is a disturbed system",
    ". then we present the uv / optical / infrared imaging and modeling of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to demonstrate that the age and metallicity of the ngc  4656uv stellar system is consistent with the interaction history of the group , providing a self consistent picture for the creation of the tidal dwarf galaxy candidate .",
    "the distribution and kinematics of  gas in the environment of the ngc  4656/ngc  4631 group provides the strongest evidence that the two edge - on spiral galaxies have undergone a recent interaction . on the galaxy group scale ,",
    "`` fingers '' extend from ngc  4631 towards ngc  4656 , as if the  gas has been stripped out of the former as the result of a gravitational encounter between the two galaxies .",
    "this has been well documented by two sets of authors , and we refer the reader to figures 1 and 3 of @xcite and figures 4 and 7 of @xcite for a perspective of  across the entire group .",
    "we use the archival vla observations to investigate the kinematics and gas morphology of ngc  4656 .",
    "we present the  data cube in the form of velocity channel maps in figures [ chans1 ] and [ chans2 ] , total intensity map ( moment 0 ) contours overlaid on a composite image in figure [ imagewcontours ] , and an intensity weighted velocity ( momen 1 ) map in figure [ mom1 ] ) .",
    "the moments are calculated independently for each pixel .",
    "the intensity weighted velocity map was created by clipping the emission below 7@xmath13 of our rms sensitivity in order to avoid large outliers .",
    "the systemic velocity of ngc  4656 is @xmath22 km s@xmath1 , while ngc  4656uv has a systemic velocity of about 570  kms@xmath1 .",
    "the channel maps show the presence of warping in the disk , as well as counterrotating and extraplanar gas . in each panel",
    "the `` x '' marks the center of the galaxy found through modeling of the rotation curve . in channels",
    "754.6  kms@xmath1  through at least 723.6  kms@xmath1 we see gas northeast of the center of the galaxy which is counterrotating with respect to the disk .",
    "channels 723.7  kms@xmath1  through 703.0  kms@xmath1  show warping in the outer portion of the disk .",
    "channels 600.0  kms@xmath1  through 548.5  kms@xmath1  show evidence of extraplanar gas ( north of the `` x '' ; identified as a `` worm '' by @xcite ) .",
    "the total  intensity map ( figure [ imagewcontours ] ) shows the neutral hydrogen gas extends beyond the optical plane of the galaxy both radially and vertically . in the tdg ( red ellipse in figures [ chans1 ] and [ chans2 ] ) appears as a continuous extension of the galaxy to the northeast .",
    "we used our knowledge of the optical morphology to exclude the gas in this region from our modeling of the rotation curve of the parent galaxy .",
    "we attempted to fit a rotation curve to ngc  4656 using a tilted ring model following the procedure of @xcite and @xcite with mixed success .",
    "the top panel of figure [ rotcur ] shows the results of fitting a rotation curve to concentric rings assuming an ideal , flat disk with constant inclination and position angle . we derived a systematic velocity of @xmath22  kms@xmath1  and inclination of approximately @xmath23 .",
    "we see that the rotational velocity rises slowly with radius , reaching a maximum of @xmath24  kms@xmath1  before roughly flattening out . from the rotation curve",
    ", we derived a total dynamical mass of @xmath25 m@xmath15 for ngc  4656 .",
    "the middle and bottom panels of figure [ rotcur ] demonstrate the quality of our assumption that the galaxy is an ideal disk by plotting how the inclination and position angle , respectively , vary with radius when we fix the rotation velocity of each ring to that found in the simple , ideal case .",
    "the ideal case fails to match all the features observed in the data : it can not account for the twisted isovelocity contours in the intensity weighted velocity map ( figure [ mom1 ] ) at the center of the main galaxy , indicating that ngc  4656 deviates from regular rotation . further modeling shows the twisted isovelocity contours can be fit with a position angle which varies with radius , as demonstrated in the bottom panel of figure [ rotcur ] .",
    "however , when we examine the data cube , the center of the galaxy is dominated by non - circular motions and clumps of counterrotating  gas at `` forbidden '' velocities , seen in velocity channel maps , which twist the isovelocity contours .",
    "figure [ major ] shows a position - velocity ( p - v ) slice through the  data cube along the major axis of the galaxy .",
    "this slice is atypical compared to what is usually observed in spiral galaxies , which exhibit a quickly rising , then flat rotation curve ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in the inner 300 arcseconds ( @xmath26 kpc ) the gas exhibits a huge velocity dispersion ( @xmath27  kms@xmath1 ) compared to the overall change in the rotation velocity with radius ( of order @xmath28  kms@xmath1 ) .",
    "the  gas is not concentrated at the systemic velocity of the galaxy , but at higher and lower velocities as if the gas is expanding in the radial direction . given the shallow potential well inferred from the slowly rising rotation curve and that ngc  4656 is a fairly low mass spiral ( 100 times less massive than the milky way ) , the modest star formation rate ( a factor of 4 - 5 times less than the milky way , see  [ sec : sfr ] ) may be sufficient to blow gas out of the center of the galaxy .",
    "we believe the disturbed  gas and gas at large heights above the disk of ngc  4656 are due to a combination of the galaxy - galaxy interaction and the current episode of vigorous star formation .",
    "extraplanar and counterrotating gas has been observed in several edge - on and inclined galaxies ( e.g. ngc  891 , @xcite ; ngc  2403 , @xcite ; ngc  2997 , @xcite ) .",
    "the presence of this gas may be indicative of active star formation , however the largest  clouds are likely evidence of accretion onto the galaxy  either of primordial origin ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , or as the result of tidal material falling back onto the disk , such as has been modeled by @xcite .",
    "figure [ imagewcontours ] shows an  envelope spatially coincident with ngc  4656uv , although offset from the apparent uv - optical center of the tdg candidate .",
    "this  envelope is connected to its parent galaxy by a smooth velocity gradient in the  gas : the p - v slice intersects the tdg candidate , identified as the density enhancement around @xmath29  kms@xmath1  ( figure [ major ] ) .",
    "we interpret the  density enhancement and the velocity gradient as evidence of the  gas having been pulled out of ngc  4656 during an interaction .",
    "the  envelope serves as the gas reservoir out of which ngc  4656uv is currently forming stars . summing the  emission in this envelope yields a total flux of @xmath30 jy . at 7.2 mpc this corresponds to a total  mass of @xmath31 m@xmath15 for the tdg candidate , consistent with the range of  masses in the @xcite sample .",
    "the peak  column density towards the tdg is @xmath32 @xmath17 , however , the column density coincident with star formation across the rest of tdg is below the supposed threshold of 10 m@xmath15 pc@xmath33 for the disk instability criterion @xcite . at the lowest level ,",
    "we observe star formation occurring at gas surface densities of 1.6 m@xmath15 pc@xmath33 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath34 here is based only on  observations , neglecting the molecular gas component which would raise the total gas surface density .",
    "nonetheless , the tdg candidate contributes to a growing body of evidence that star formation can occur in low density environments .",
    "the  density enhancement we associate with ngc  4656uv is evident in previous observations , however @xcite proposed it was one side of an  ring encircling the optically bright edge on galaxy .",
    "we consider this and other possible explanations in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the identification of the uv - bright / optically faint stellar component to the northeast of the galaxy ( ngc  4656uv ) is motivation for reconsidering the gaseous structure .",
    "there is no stellar counterpart to the southwest portion of the proposed  ring .",

    "the main region ( and , due to the main region s significantly higher brightness than the tail or the hook , ngc  4656 as a whole ) has a shallower slope in both the uv and the optical , indicative of old stellar populations present in the center of the galaxy .",
    "all parts of ngc  4656 contain cold dust , although the tail appears to be deficient in 70 @xmath6 m emission compared to the rest of the galaxy .",
    "the @xmath19-band detection in ngc  4656uv is odd , considering how similar the rest of its uv - optical sed is to the postulated parent galaxy .",
    "significant excess flux in the @xmath19-band would be a strong indicator of an older stellar population , one either formed in - situ ( if ngc  4656uv is a pre - existing dwarf galaxy ) or ripped from ngc  4656 at the same time as the neutral gas currently powering the ongoing episode of star formation ( if ngc  4656uv is a tdg ) .",
    "a visual inspection of the @xmath19-band image clearly shows a signal that is consistent spatially with ngc  4656uv , however the detection is at small dn / pixel and there are similar - magnitude surface gradients nearby , similar to the 24 @xmath6 m band ( see row 3 of figure [ fig : skysubcompare ] , and note especially the vertical bands on the image ) .",
    "we believe that these gradients are responsible for artificially boosting the @xmath19-band flux given the otherwise strong similarity between the seds of ngc  4656uv and ngc  4656 , but in  [ galev ] we consider the consequences of it being a real feature in ngc  4656uv s sed .",
    "we compute ngc  4656uv s star formation rate ( sfr ) using the conversion from fuv flux given by @xcite : @xmath121 at the assumed distance of 7.2 mpc , ngc  4656uv s fuv luminosity is @xmath122 erg s@xmath123 .",
    "therefore , we calculate a star formation rate of @xmath124 m@xmath15 yr@xmath1 for the tdg candidate . this is consistent with the mean star formation rate of tdgs according to @xcite .",
    "for the parent galaxy , ngc  4656 , we compute a sfr of @xmath125 m@xmath15 yr@xmath1 , roughly 25 times greater than that of ngc  4656uv .",
    "the fuv sfr for ngc  4656 is comparable to literature estimates of the sfr from h@xmath5 , but roughly a factor of two smaller than the far - infrared sfr and the 1.4 ghz radio sfr @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy may be caused by dust attenuation on the uv emission of ngc  4656 , a source of uncertainty noted by @xcite ; however , we will show in  [ galev ] that evolutionary synthesis models predict very low amounts of dust in ngc  4656uv , implying that attenuation corrections on the sfr of the tdg candidate should be small .",
    "the @xcite conversion formula has been optimized for relatively stable , long - lived , quiescent galaxies . additionally , the calibration of equation ( [ eq : sfr ] ) depends on the initial mass function and stellar library chosen for modeling this relationship . as ngc  4656uv is a very different star - forming environment than the galaxies used to obtain equation ( [ eq : sfr ] )",
    "the sfr computed using this formula should be treated with caution .",
    "one of the most obvious differences between the seds of ngc  4656 and ngc  4656uv is the lack of dust detected from mid- and far - ir emission in ngc  4656uv .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the non - detections are due to a true lack of dust or the faintness of the tdg candidate",
    ". therefore , we attempt to estimate what we should expect to observe for ngc  4656uv based on its uv and optical properties .",
    "while all portions of ngc  4656 have similar seds in the uv and optical to ngc  4656uv , ngc  4656 s tail is the most alike .",
    "if we assume that this similarity extends into the mid - ir , then using the same ratio of nuv to 70 @xmath6 m flux as the tail of ngc  4656 , we predict that ngc  4656uv should have a flux of 0.172 jy at 70 @xmath6 m : roughly 1.5 times the 10@xmath13 detection limit .",
    "we use the nuv flux in this ratio because both bands should trace the ongoing star formation event , however we note that no ratio of wavelengths predict a flux below our 10@xmath13 detection limit .",
    "the estimated nuv/160 @xmath6 m flux ratios are , however , consistent with a non - detection for ngc  4656uv .",
    "these ratios indicate that ngc  4656uv has a lower cold dust density than even the most diffuse regions on ngc  4656 .",
    "given the very active star formation in ngc  4656uv , it is also valuable to estimate the expected flux from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) . in a sample of star forming regions formed in collisional debris , @xcite report 8.0 @xmath6 m detections in all systems , indicating that many tidal features exhibit emission from small grains of pahs ( although holmberg ix , a nearby tdg candidate that will be discussed in more depth in  [ comparetdgs ] , was not detected in 8.0 @xmath6 m by @xcite ) .",
    "pah emission has also been detected in tdgs at several wavelengths by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , since the archival irac 8.0 @xmath6 m image only contains about half of ngc  4656uv , a direct comparison of 8.0 @xmath6 m fluxes with uv emission using the formulae given by @xcite is impossible .",
    "however , the general lack of dust emission in the irac bands suggests an overall under abundance of pahs .",
    "this may be due to ngc  4656uv s very low metallicity , consistent with our sed analysis and galev modeling ( detailed in  [ galev ] ) .      in order to gain more insight into ngc  4656uv s star - formation history , age , metallicity , and extinction we created a set of stellar population synthesis models using galev @xcite .",
    "being chiefly interested in the ongoing starburst we chose an exponentially declining burst star formation rate with an e - folding time of 200 myr .",
    "we considered a set of five metallicities ranging from [ fe / h ] = @xmath126 to 0.0 ( solar ) , including a model with a `` chemically consistent metallicity '' .",
    "the `` chemically consistent '' model starts with the burst at primordial metal abundance , then tracks the evolving gas - phase metal abundance as the stellar populations age , die , and return metals into the ism ( see @xcite for more information ) .",
    "we include this model as the most limiting case of low metal enrichment .",
    "we varied the amount of dust , using a calzetti attenuation model with extinction up to e(b - v ) = 0.5 mag @xcite .    for each model ,",
    "fluxes are computed for all passbands , then a least - squares fit is performed at each model age to fit the model fluxes to the data for ngc  4656uv . to focus on the recent star formation we fit only to the uv+@xmath127 data ,",

    "[ fig : galevplot ] we plot the model with the best fitting age for each metallicity , overlaid with the measured flux of ngc  4656uv in each wavelength band . adding dust to the models",
    "decreased the resulting age of the system .",
    "for example , adding e(b  v ) = 0.1 mag of dust resulted in a younger best fitting age for the tdg by a factor of 1.52 , regardless of metallicity .",
    "however , the best fitting models for all metallicities had e(b  v ) @xmath128 0.05 mag , with most models requiring zero dust .",
    "as the metallicity increases there is a slight trend of increasing best fit age : the best fit ages are 280 myr at [ fe / h ] = @xmath126 , 292 myr at [ fe / h ] = @xmath129 , 320 myr at [ fe / h ] = @xmath130 , and 288 myr at solar .",
    "the chemically consistent model has the youngest age , 264 myr .",
    "the best fits overall are given by the chemically consistent and [ fe / h ] = @xmath126 models .",
    "at the best fit age the chemically consistent model has a metallicity of [ fe / h ] = @xmath131 , @xmath70.65 dex lower than even the least abundant fixed metallicity model .",
    "the apparent low metallicity of ngc  4656uv is surprising given that tdgs are traditionally metal - rich in relation to normal dwarfs .",
    "however , the system as a whole is metal - deficient with ngc  4656 having a metallicity of @xmath132 dex @xcite .",
    "ngc  4656uv s metallicity is @xmath710 times smaller than that of its parent galaxy .",
    "this may be explained if ngc  4656uv was formed out of gas stripped from the extreme outer disk of ngc  4656 , which would be more metal - poor than gas closer to the center of the parent galaxy . while tdgs of all luminosities appear to have a fairly consistent z@xmath15/3 metallicity @xcite , much higher than found for ngc  4656uv ,",
    "the overall dearth of matter and metals in this group indicate that ngc  4656uv is forming in a different environment than most tdgs .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath19-band excess is due to background gradients we find that while the models are minimized only to the bluest six detections , both the chemically consistent and [ fe / h ] = @xmath126 models do a fairly good job approximating the 3.6 @xmath6 m flux .",
    "the chemically consistent model indicate that all of the 3.6 @xmath6 m emission comes from starlight while the [ fe / h ] = @xmath126 model allows for a dust contribution of roughly 10 - 25% of the total light . at [ fe / h ]",
    "= @xmath129 and higher the models over predict the 3.6 @xmath6 m emission , a further indication that ngc  4656uv contains low metallicity gas .",
    "we investigate the possibility that the @xmath19-band excess is due to an older , more evolved population from a much earlier starburst by over plotting the sed of the [ fe / h ] = -1.7 model for a 13.6 gyr old burst on figure [ fig : galevplot ] . even for this extremely old population",
    ", too much light is emitted in the @xmath20 , @xmath133 , and 3.6 @xmath6 m bands to fit ngc  4656uv s sed . in order to fit the @xmath19-band signal without over predicting the emission in other bandpasses",
    "the old population would have to have the characteristic spectrum of a late m - type star ( plotted in red in figure [ fig : galevplot ] ) .",
    "the inability of the 13.6 gyr model to even approach a good fit of the data is another indicator that the @xmath19-band flux is aberrant .",
    "however , we note that even with the current data , we can not conclusively rule out the possibility that there is an extremely old stellar population in ngc  4656uv .",
    "while it is generally difficult to confirm that a galaxy is indeed a tidal dwarf without detailed stellar population studies ( e.g. holmberg ix , @xcite ) or detailed dynamical modeling ( e.g. @xcite ) , we favor ngc  4656uv s recent formation through a tidal interaction , most likely between ngc  4656 and ngc  4631 . in the following sections we discuss the likelihood of other possible origin scenarios in the context of the kinematic and stellar data we have presented . finally , we compare ngc  4656uv to observations of other star forming systems and tidal dwarf candidates .",
    "we postulate that ngc  4656uv formed out of gas stripped from the outskirts of ngc  4656 during a recent interaction .",

    "the difference in the line - of - sight velocities towards ngc  4656 and ngc  4631 is @xmath740  kms@xmath1 , which is extremely low for a group velocity dispersion , and may suggest that most of the relative velocity between the two galaxies is in the plane of the sky . with a projected separation of 36 kpc and assuming a typical group velocity dispersion of 200  kms@xmath1",
    ", we estimate that the two spiral galaxies could have interacted as recently as 230 myr ago , comparable to the post - starburst age estimates from the galev models .",
    "detailed kinematic modeling is required to strengthen the case that ngc  4656uv was created by an interaction , but the  bridge observed by @xcite and @xcite and lend weight to ngc  4631 as the perturber .",
    "several features of the uv - ir sed and the neutral hydrogen maps imply a tidal origin for ngc  4656uv .",
    "the disassociated morphology of ngc  4656uv , seen both in  contours and especially in the uv stellar emission , indicates that ngc  4656uv is a separate entity from ngc  4656 .",

    "this indicates that ngc  4656uv is right at the cutoff of being gravitationally unbound , perhaps unsurprising given that it appears to have been so recently liberated from ngc  4656 but has remained as a single entity .",
    "combined with our estimate of the virial ratio , the large diameter of ngc  4656uv may indicate that the system is at least partially ( if not fully ) unbound .",
    "we note that this estimate is extremely rough : the density is not constant across the entire tdg , and the peak of the density distribution is not coincident with the center of the stellar distribution .",

    "additionally , even if some or all of ngc  4656uv is self - gravitating it is unclear whether or not this system will be fully ejected from ngc  4656 or will fall back onto its parent galaxy .    we can also use these estimates of rotation velocity and size to estimate a total dynamical mass : @xmath141 we estimate that @xmath142 m@xmath15 for ngc  4656uv , only 3.4 times larger than the mass of the  gas + stars .",
    "this discrepancy is similar to that found in other systems believed to be formed out of collisional debris ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "regardless , it appears that ngc  4656uv has a relatively low ratio of dark - to - luminous matter compared to other dwarf galaxies ( see @xcite for a review ) , further supporting our hypothesis that ngc  4656uv formed from tidal interactions .",
    "unfortunately , we can not make a confident statement about the future of this star forming system and whether it might be long lived .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a uv - bright tidal dwarf galaxy candidate in the ngc 4631/4656 galaxy group , which we designate ngc  4656uv . using survey and archival data spanning from 1.4 ghz to the ultraviolet </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the gas kinematics and stellar properties of this system . </S>",
    "<S> the  morphologies of ngc  4656uv and its parent galaxy ngc  4656 are extremely disturbed , with significant amounts of counterrotating and extraplanar gas . from uv - fir photometry , computed using a new method to correct for surface gradients on faint objects , we find that ngc  4656uv has no significant dust opacity and a blue spectral energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we compute a star formation rate of 0.027 @xmath0 yr@xmath1 from the fuv flux and measure a total  mass of 3.8@xmath2 for the object . </S>",
    "<S> evolutionary synthesis modeling indicates that ngc  4656uv is a low metallicity system whose only major burst of star formation occurred within the last @xmath3 myr . </S>",
    "<S> the age of the stellar population is consistent with a rough timescale for a recent tidal interaction between ngc  4656 and ngc  4631 , although we discuss the true nature of the object  whether it is tidal or pre - existing in origin  in the context of its metallicity being a factor of ten lower than its parent galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate that ngc  4656uv is either marginally bound _ or _ unbound . </S>",
    "<S> if bound , it contains relatively low amounts of dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of archival data allows for a deeper investigation into this dynamic system than is currently possible for most tdg candidates . </S>"
