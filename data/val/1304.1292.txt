    "the aim of this paper is to survey some of the rapidly evolving ideas in the field of quantum contextuality .",
    "it can be argued that this field was in suspended animation during the intervening period between its conception in seminal papers by bell and kochen and specker in 1967 @xcite and the 2007 landmark discovery of a simple and experimentally verifiable inequality by klyachko et al .",
    "post 2007 there has been steady development of quantum contextuality .",
    "however in the view of the authors of this paper , the field is currently in a nascent interlude and still has undeveloped potential capable of creating an explosion of mainstream interest . with this in mind",
    "we would like to give a succinct summary of the progress on quantum contextuality at this junction .",
    "we also present a uniform approach to quantum contextuality and what is commonly referred to as quantum nonlocality which we believe delivers a stable platform for developing new results .    through this platform",
    "we hope to find applications for quantum contextuality and thereby move it out of the realm of foundations of quantum mechanics and into mainstream quantum information science .",
    "quantum nonlocality has two undeniably important practical applications : device independent quantum key distribution @xcite and private amplification of randomness @xcite . because quantum nonlocality is a special case of contextuality it should also be possible to find practical applications for quantum contextuality .",
    "once this happens we will witness a significant amplification of research in this area .",
    "quantum mechanics has always struggled with interpretational issues to the extent where its founding fathers famously contested the theoretical foundations of the new field .",
    "this struggle resulted in a seminal paper by einstein , podolsky and rosen ( epr ) in 1935 @xcite which introduced a philosophical manifesto called local realism . from epr",
    "s perspective local realism is a very fundamental property of nature that underpins every physical theory .",
    "the local realism hypothesis purports that observable properties of physical systems should exist objectively ( i.e. properties of states exist independently of the observer ) and concurrently the outcome of measuring any physical property can not be influenced by space like separated events .",
    "it is worth pointing out that all relativistic theories of matter obey local realism .",
    "however , as demonstrated experimentally by aspect et al . in 1982",
    "@xcite , quantum mechanics is not locally realistic .",
    "epr effectively started a programme of constructing hidden variable theories @xcite . here",
    "the unilateral assumption is that the outcomes of measurements of physical properties reveal the underlying well defined properties of the measured system .",
    "for instance , if one measures the spin of a quantum particle along direction  @xmath0 \" and obtains value  @xmath1 \" , ( the spin points up along the  @xmath0 \" direction ) a hidden variable theory would argue that this property of the spin ( the property of being up along the  @xmath0 \" direction ) was revealed by the act of measurement .",
    "in contrast , quantum mechanics tells us that this property was created by the act of measurement @xcite . a general statement that the outcomes of experiments exist objectively is of no use if it can not be empirically verified .",
    "adjudicating between quantum mechanics and hidden variables requires both theories to be reformulated in terms of experimentally testable predictions .    in this paper",
    "we are specifically interested in a special class of hidden variable theories called non - contextual hidden variables ( nchv ) .",
    "nchv theories can be simply characterized in the following way .",
    "let us assume that we can measure some properties of a given physical systems denoted as @xmath2 , where each measurable property @xmath3 can yield outcomes @xmath4 .",
    "the noncontextual assumption states that the outcome of measuring @xmath3 is independent of which other members of the set @xmath5 are coincidentally measured .",
    "it is important to note here that each outcome value @xmath6 can appear inherently randomly ( determinism being a special case ) .",
    "the description noncontextual means that the outcomes of measurements do not depend on the context in which they are measured , i.e. , the outcome of @xmath3 is independent of whether it was measured in the context of @xmath7 or @xmath8 .",
    "the original question of contextuality of quantum theory is based on elementary events that are represented by projectors in hilbert space .",
    "two projectors are orthogonal , if the corresponding events are exclusive .",
    "the impossibility of outcome assignment , i.e. , the impossibility of nchv preassigning outcomes to events is formalized by the bell - kochen - specker - theorem @xcite ( bks theorem ) :    _ in dimension greater than two ; there exist projectors @xmath9 such that it is not always possible to assign outcomes @xmath10 to all projectors in such a way that _    1 .",
    "_ for any complete orthogonal basis of projectors @xmath11 the assignment satisfies @xmath12 ( completeness of the basis ) _ 2 .",
    "_ if a projector , @xmath9 , belongs to multiple complete bases then it is consistently assigned the same value in all bases ( noncontextual condition ) .",
    "_    the formulation of the bks theorem with projectors can be considered as the most fundamental , since projectors correspond to elementary events that can either happen or not .",
    "however , the problem of contextuality was also defined for observables that are linear combinations of projectors .",
    "an elegant simple example of contextuality with @xmath13 observables is given in - terms of the mermin - peres square @xcite .",
    "consider a bipartite system of two spin @xmath14 particles .",
    "take the square array : @xmath15    where @xmath16 are pauli matrices and @xmath17 is the identity matrix and the operators have been arranged so that columns and rows form mutually commuting triads .",
    "note that the product of the triad of operators in the last column is @xmath18 , while in every other row and column the product is @xmath19 .",
    "the mermin - peres square is a state - independent proof of the bks theorem because a value assignment of @xmath13 to each operator in the above array can not reproduce this algebra @xcite .",
    "this became an enduring foundational arguments for quantum contextuality .",
    "noncontextual hidden variables exist if and only if the outcomes of all observable properties of a given physical system can be described by a joint probability distribution @xcite .",
    "let us elaborate on this statement as it plays a central role in our review and provides a mathematically rigorous approach to nchv theories .",
    "we will also focus on this topic in the next section .",
    "consider a set of observables @xmath20 that represent some physical properties of a quantum system .",
    "in general the corresponding operators , which we denote by the same letters @xmath21 do not all commute . according to quantum mechanics it is possible to simultaneously measure a set of observables if and only if the associated operators are mutually commutative . to make this statement clear we consider three observables",
    "@xmath22 such that @xmath23=0 , [ a_1,a_3]=0 $ ] but @xmath24\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "quantum mechanics gives us two experimentally verifiable probability distributions @xmath25 and @xmath26 and nothing beyond this .",
    "however , nchv would assume the existence of a joint probability distribution for all observables , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "experimental veracity of this assumption would require that both the experimentally accessible distributions @xmath28 and @xmath26 can be consistently recovered as marginals from some well defined joint probability distribution : @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "we illustrate these concepts via a spinless quantum particle in a one - dimensional space .",
    "the experimentally measurable properties are : momentum and position .",
    "we denote the respective outcomes @xmath31 and @xmath0 .",
    "the noncontextual hidden variable description presupposes a joint probability distribution @xmath32 . we can ask whether this joint provability distribution @xmath32 is supported by quantum mechanics , which simply means that the marginal probability distributions @xmath33 and @xmath34 must be recovered from @xmath32 by appropriate integration . here",
    "noncommutativity of the two operators guarantees a joint probability distribution through @xmath35 .",
    "discrepancies between noncontextual hidden variable theories and quantum mechanics only arise when both commuting and noncommuting observables are present .",
    "we note that local realism is a special case of noncontextual hidden variables . here",
    "spacelike separated measurements naturally correspond to commutative operators . given two spacelike separated observers : alice and bob who have adjustable measurement settings , if bob decides to measure an observable @xmath36 then each of alice s measurement settings furnishes a context for @xmath36 .",
    "we say the theory is noncontextual if bob s measurement outcome is independent of alice s settings . due to the spacelike separation between bob s measurement and alice s choice of settings we refer to this scenario as local realism .",
    "on the other hand , the general formulation of contextuality allows measurements to be performed on a single system .",
    "therefore , the compatibility of measurements does not have to follow from the spacelike separation of observers .",
    "it is an ongoing challenge to generalize all facets of nonlocality to contextual scenarios . in particular , despite the fact that nonlocality has found many computational applications , it is still unknown if general contextuality can be considered as a meaningful computational resource .",
    "we find the question whether single system contextuality , where nonlocal correlations and communication are no longer useful resources , can be used to outperform classical algorithms fascinating .",
    "in section [ sec : anoverview ] we approach contextuality by identifying it with the nonexistence of a joint probability distribution . in the process",
    "we highlight the close relationship between nonlocal and general noncontextual scenarios and some of the recent discoveries in the field of contextuality . in section [ sec : contextualityinequalities ] we review some prominent test of the contextuality of quantum theory .",
    "we naturally bipartition these tests into state - dependent and state - independent tests of contextuality . in section [ sec : differentapproaches ] we present some alternative approaches and properties of contextuality that are based on previous studies on nonlocality .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : experiment ] we discuss some recent experiments that verified both , state - dependent and state - independent contextuality .",
    "we begin by identifying some key concepts which can be used to approach the discussion of contextual inequalities and experiments in the proceeding sections .",
    "we discuss how contextuality arises in systems possessing some measurable properties , @xmath37 , whose measurement statistics can not be described by a joint probability distribution ; an approach which is also used to study bell inequalities and the problem of nonlocality .",
    "we will draw on this common framework to establish contextuality and its relation to the pre - established seminal work on non - existence of joint probability distributions in nonlocal scenarios .",
    "we continue the perspective that contextuality is a more general feature than nonlocality and that many nonlocal properties should be somehow manifested in a more general form when considered in contextual scenarios .",
    "application of bell - like inequalities to general contextuality is a new field of research and some properties of new contextual inequalities have only recently been discovered .",
    "consider the following problem .",
    "an experiment returns a large amount of data corresponding to outcomes of measurements @xmath38 .",
    "the data was collected in many repetitions of the experiment .",
    "it is assumed that each measurement @xmath3 refers to some physical property of the system that is being measured and that its outcomes @xmath6 are discrete .",
    "the data allows you to estimate probabilities of events like @xmath39 , or @xmath40 .",
    "however , imagine that due to some reason in a single run of the experiment only special subsets @xmath41 were measured , hence you are limited to estimate probabilities @xmath42 corresponding to these subsets . here",
    ", we use the simplified notation @xmath43 .",
    "your task is to determine if a joint probability distribution @xmath44 that can give a rise to all measurable marginal probabilities @xmath45 can in principle exist .    what is implied by the existence of a joint probability distribution ?",
    "any such probability distribution has to be supported on a set of events . to characterize an event we preassigned outcomes of all measurable quantities",
    "; in this case events are of the form : @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the existence of a joint probability distribution implies that it is possible to preassign outcomes to measurements before the actual measurement happens . in this scenario",
    "the measurement outcome of every property existed independently of the act of observation .",
    "furthermore within the set of co - measurable properties @xmath47 , the outcome of measuring @xmath3 is independent of which other members of the set are coincidentally measured .",
    "this is often called the _ objective realism _ hypothesis .",
    "it is a hallmark of systems governed by the laws of classical physics . in quantum mechanics",
    "this possibility is often associated with some non accessible hidden variables , that together with a state vector @xmath48 would be able to determine outcomes of all measurements on the system .    on the other hand , if the outcomes of measurements do not exist before the measurement is performed ( to which one often refers as to lack of _ realism _ ) , or if the outcomes depend on what other measurements are done at the same time ( _ contextuality _ ) , a joint probability distribution does not exists .",
    "this fact was first observed for nonlocal scenarios in ref .",
    "@xcite , and was later extended to contextual scenarios in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we have shown that the problem of the existence of a joint probability distribution arises due to the fact that not all measurements can be performed in a single experiment . following quantum mechanics",
    ", we refer to this property as to _",
    "complementarity_. on the other hand , if two measurements can be performed in the same experiment we call them _",
    "it is therefore natural to ask what kind of complementarity and compatibility relations can give rise to the lack of a joint probability distribution .",
    "this problem was studied in ref .",
    "below we summarize the main results .",
    "first we introduce graphs representing complementarity relation , where each vertex corresponds to some measurement and two vertices are connected by an edge if the two measurements are compatible .",
    "an example of such graph is presented in figure [ fig : jpd1 ] . every clique in the graph ,",
    "i.e. , a subgraph in which all vertices are mutually connected , forms a set of measurements for which joint probability distributions can be experimentally estimated .",
    "for example , the graph in figure [ fig : jpd1 ] a ) consists of four measurements : a , b , c and d. probabilities that can be measured are : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "can one find a joint probability distribution @xmath56 capable of reproducing measurable marginals ?    in case of example a ) such probability distribution exists .",
    "it can be constructed in the following way @xmath57 note , that although this construction may seem artificial , due to complementarity relation one is not able to disproof its validity .",
    "moreover , the above construction recovers all measurable marginals .",
    "for example @xmath58 the above follows from the fact that for all @xmath0 and @xmath59 one has @xmath60 ( we will come back to this problem later ) .",
    "joint probability distributions can be constructed in an analogous way for all complementarity graphs that do not contain cycles of size greater than three .",
    "3-cycles are already cliques , therefore one can experimentally estimate a joint probability distribution for all three measurements in the cycle .",
    "the construction goes as follows .",
    "first , we multiply joint probability distributions for all cliques ( 3-cycles and two vertices connected by an edge ) in the graph and next we divide by the joint probabilities of measurements that appear more than once . if a measurement , say a , appears @xmath61-times , one divides the product of probabilities of cliques by @xmath62 . for more details",
    "see @xcite . for example , a joint probability distribution for the case b ) ( figure [ fig : jpd1 ] ) can be constructed as @xmath63    the marginal probabilities can be obtained by summing over all other measurements . however , summation must be performed in the specific order .",
    "we start summation from the measurements that in the construction appear only in one clique . after the summation ,",
    "some terms cancel and we obtain a new distribution .",
    "next , we sum over measurements that in the new distribution appear only once .",
    "we follow this recursive procedure as long as a desired marginal probability is obtained .    for graphs that contain cycles of size greater than three the above construction does not work .",
    "this is because of two reasons .",
    "first , @xmath61-cycles ( @xmath64 ) are not cliques themselves , therefore one can not experimentally evaluate probabilities for all measurements in the cycle",
    ". moreover , in @xmath61-cycles every vertex appears in more than one clique and the above summation procedure can not be performed .",
    "therefore one arrives at the necessary condition for the lack of joint probability distribution .",
    "namely , the lack of a joint probability distribution can be detected only in scenarios in which complementarity relation between measurements induces cycles of size greater than three . in the figure [ fig : jpd1 ] only the case c ) may not admit a joint probability distribution .",
    "note , that this case corresponds to a well known clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) nonlocal scenario @xcite in which four measurements are done on a bipartite system .",
    "two complementary measurements ( say a and c ) are done on the first subsystem , whereas the other two ( b and d ) are done on the second subsystem . for a detailed study of probability distributions and inequalities based on @xmath61-cycles",
    "@xcite .",
    "every bell - like inequality relies on three assumptions : free will , realism and non - contextuality . the free will assumption , i.e. , observers can freely choose which measurements to perform , is rarely questioned on the scientific grounds @xcite .",
    "moreover , the joint probability distribution approach does not require the discussion of the free will assumption .",
    "therefore , we focus on the remaining two assumptions",
    ".    the notions of nonlocality and contextuality refer to our classical intuition . in classical physics values of physical parameters associated with outcomes",
    "@xmath6 exist independently of whether we decide to measure them or not . in this sense",
    "classical theories are often said to be realistic .",
    "sometimes measurement outcomes of a realistic theory can not be described by a joint probability distribution .",
    "this happens when the outcome of measuring a property depends on what other measurements are performed at the same time . in general this dependence is called contextuality , since the outcome depends on the measurement context . in the special case where the measurements are performed in different spatial locations the same dependence is known as nonlocality .",
    "putting aside the free will assumption , present experiments can not uniquely determine whether the universe lacks realism or is contextual in the above sense ( or both ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is commonly accepted to refer to quantum phenomena which exhibit these effects as to quantum contextuality and quantum nonlocality respectively .",
    "the non - contextuality assumption states that measurement outcomes do not depend on what other measurements are performed at the same time .",
    "as this is a key point we highlight it by using an explicit example .",
    "consider a system with measurable properties @xmath65 .",
    "take all possible subsets comprised of jointly co - measurable properties .",
    "let @xmath66 be a representative subset ; we say @xmath67 furnishes a measurement context for each of its elements @xmath68 .",
    "the system is noncontextual if we can uniquely determine the measurement statics of a property @xmath3 by sampling its outcomes @xmath6 in measurement context @xmath67 . in other words for every property @xmath69 ,",
    "the measurement outcomes of this property are the same irrespective of which measurement context is chosen .    in case of nonlocal bell - type scenarios",
    "the assumption that measurement outcomes of alice do not depend on spacelike separated measurement choices made by bob is supported by the special theory of relativity which dictates no interaction can spread faster than the speed of light . it is therefore assumed that any potential interaction that could cause violation of some bell inequality would have to obey special relativity , and hence it would have no effect if two measurements were spatially separated . on the other hand , in contextual scenarios in which measurements are performed on the same system",
    "one lacks additional support for non - contextuality coming from other physical theories . in this case",
    "non - contextuality is rather a reasonable assumption that is supported on our realistic everyday experience that values of physical properties are independent of what other properties are observed at the same time .",
    "this is because the measurement is only assumed to reveal the value of the measured property without any interference .",
    "it has been demonstrated by fine @xcite that the existence of such a joint probability distribution is necessary and sufficient conditions for constructing a non - contextual hidden variable theory capable of replicating the measurement statistics .",
    "the smallest contextual quantum system has three levels and can be physically realized by a spin 1 system . due to its relative simplicity , the spin 1 system is often used to study contextuality .",
    "here it is possible to interpret measurable properties as projectors onto eigenstates @xmath70 of the spin operators @xmath71 which measures spin relative to a direction @xmath72 . in quantum mechanics projectors onto the two spin 1 states",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath73 respectively , can be jointly measured if @xmath72 and @xmath74 are orthogonal .",
    "physically , if the measurement projects the state of a spin 1 particle onto @xmath70 one learns that _ the direction of spin is orthogonal to @xmath72_.    a joint measurement of projectors onto @xmath70 and @xmath73 corresponds to a question : _ which of the two orthogonal directions @xmath72 and @xmath74 the spin direction is orthogonal to?_.    it follows that @xmath70 can be measured together with @xmath73 or @xmath75 , where @xmath74 and @xmath76 lie in the yz - plane .",
    "these two measurement possibilities create a context and one may ask how it is possible that the property : _ the spin direction is orthogonal to @xmath72 _ , depends on what other direction is investigated at the same time .",
    "obviously , there is no known physical principle stating that properties of the spin direction can not change from one measurement context to another .",
    "nevertheless , it would be very strange ( according to our classical intuition ) if they did .",
    "studies of contextuality focus on theories in which the context dependence is not explicit in a sense that the outcome of measurements may depend on the context , but the probabilities are context independent .",
    "this means that for all measurements @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 one has @xmath80 , irrespective of whether @xmath78 and @xmath79 are compatible or complementary @xcite .",
    "quantum theory is one such theory .",
    "the violation of this assumption , i.e. , @xmath81 leads to peculiar effects .",
    "for example , if @xmath78 and @xmath79 were performed on a different system than @xmath77 , the violation of the above property would lead to a superluminal signaling .",
    "therefore , in nonlocal scenarios the condition @xmath82 is known as the _ no - signaling _ condition . in general contextual scenarios we refer to this property as to _ no - disturbance _",
    "@xcite .",
    "contextual scenarios which probe the bks theorem often assume that measurements correspond to events . in this case",
    "the compatibility relation takes the form of exclusivity . in quantum mechanics events",
    "are represented by projectors and exclusivity occurs if two projectors are orthogonal .",
    "the corresponding complementarity graphs represent the exclusivity relations ( exclusivity graphs ) , where two vertices are connected if the corresponding events are exclusive . for some examples of how these graphs could look see figure [ fig : jpd1 ] .",
    "let us now discuss experimental tests of inequalities based on exclusive events .",
    "first of all , for a pair of exclusive events a and b only one of three scenarios can happen in a laboratory : either the first event occurs ( @xmath83 ) , the second event occurs ( @xmath84 ) , or both events do not occur ( @xmath85 ) . due to the no - disturbance condition",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath87 , and exclusivity demands that @xmath88 , where @xmath89 ( respectively @xmath90 ) is the event @xmath91 ( respectively @xmath92 ) .",
    "this has to hold for all exclusive events , therefore in all exclusivity graphs the sum of probabilities corresponding to connected vertices has to be bounded by one .",
    "moreover , under the assumption that a set of mutually pairwise exclusive events is exclusive @xcite , the sum of probabilities in any clique has to be bounded by one too .",
    "despite the above restrictions on probabilities , one still has some freedom when assigning probabilities to vertices . the non - contextual bound in inequalities based on exclusive events",
    "is derived under the assumption that a joint probability distribution for all events exists .",
    "these inequalities take the form of the sums of individual probabilities of all events .",
    "the non - contextual bound was shown to be equal to the independence number @xmath93 of the corresponding exclusivity graph , @xmath94 , for the set of projectors @xmath95 : @xmath96 where in the above @xmath97 is the set of vertices belonging to the exclusivity graph @xmath94 and by @xmath33 we mean the probability of getting outcome @xmath98 when measuring projector @xmath99 @xcite .",
    "the independence number is the maximal number of mutually disjoined vertices in the graph , which in our case corresponds to the maximal number of events that can occur , under the assumption that whether event occurs or not does not depend on the measurement ( realism ) .",
    "the maximum value of the left hand side of equation ( [ eq : generalforminequality ] ) attainable by quantum observables was shown to correspond to the lovasz @xmath100-function of @xmath94 , which is another graph property obeying @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "the lovasz @xmath100-function is based on the orthogonal representation of graphs and is defined as @xmath102 where @xmath48 is a unit vector and @xmath103 is a set of unit vectors @xmath104 corresponding to vertices of the graph having the property , that the two vectors are orthogonal if the corresponding vertices are connected by an edge .",
    "the most interesting scenario is when the lovasz @xmath100-function of @xmath94 is greater than independence number ; under these circumstances inequality ( [ eq : generalforminequality ] ) can be used to demonstrate contextuality of quantum theory .",
    "no - disturbance and exclusivity allows for even greater violation of the inequality .",
    "however , recent results suggests that lovasz @xmath100-function , and hence quantum mechanics , allows for greatest possible violation of contextual inequalities that are compliant with the exclusivity principle which states that the sum of probabilities of pairwise exclusive events is bounded by one .",
    "if one applies this principle to a set of events corresponding to a single test , one may obtain even greater violation than the violation allowed in quantum theory .",
    "however , if one applies this principle to a set of events corresponding to multiple independent tests ( global exclusivity ) , one may find that the extended structure of subsets of pairwise exclusive events can lead to stronger bounds on contextuality @xcite .",
    "in simple words , a contextuality test examines whether expectation values of a number of observables can not be described via joint probability distributions . in cases considered in this work",
    ", this corresponds to a detection of the violation of certain inequalities that involve expectation values obtained in a laboratory .",
    "however because an expectation value is a linear combinations of probabilities , the inequalities can take an alternative form similar to equation ( [ eq : generalforminequality ] ) .",
    "the original bks theorem does not depend on a state of the system .",
    "quantum contextuality , as introduced by kochen and specker @xcite ( and independently motivated by bell @xcite ) , is a property of measurements , not a property of states .    on the other hand quantum nonlocality",
    "is the lack of a joint probability distribution which can be constructed under the assumptions of local realism and noncontextuality .",
    "however , quantum nonlocality can only occur if the state of the measured system is entangled .",
    "this may seem to contradict our perspective that nonlocality belongs to the general framework of contextuality .    from the perspective of testing types of contextuality , nonlocality tests are state dependent because all permissable measurements on the quantum system must be implementable by local operations .",
    "this is a strong restriction on the set of measurements which can be performed .    in order to reveal the lack of a joint probability distribution for all states one needs to have enough freedom in choosing the measurement settings .",
    "the ability to preform a test which reveals contextuality for all quantum states ( a state - independent test ) is a property of a set of observables which have sufficiently exploited this freedom to enable detection of contextuality in the completely mixed state .    in multipartite scenarios",
    "this would involve global nonlocal measurements on all parts of the system . in case of the standard bks scenario",
    "all measurements are performed on a single system , therefore in principle there are no restrictions on measurements .    in the following two sections we will be focussing on state - dependent and state - independent tests of contextuality .",
    "state - independent tests are capable of revealing contextual behavior for any state of the quantum system .",
    "explicitly , a state - independent test invokes a set of observables @xmath105 such that for any state of the quantum system there is no joint probability distribution describing the outcome of measuring these observables on that state . while state - dependent tests typically use fewer observables to show that no joint probability distribution can describe the measurement outcomes on certain nominated states of the quantum system .    in subsection",
    "[ sec : statedepandindep ] we will expand upon this topic by showing how to convert a specific state - independent tests into state - dependent tests . the general procedure is to restrict the collection of measurable observables .",
    "we would like to use the techniques from subsection [ sec : contextualrelationsbounds ] to derive state - dependent contextual inequalities .",
    "this is a critical step in the development of experimental tests of contextuality .",
    "we focus on developing ideas rather than listing the numerous state - dependent inequalities .",
    "we begin with a game where systems exhibiting quantum contextuality can be interpreted as resource states which can boost the chances of winning @xcite .",
    "an observer has access to a classical system which can be prepared in any arbitrary mixture of five classical states , labeled @xmath106 .",
    "they are tasked with ascertaining the answers to five yes - no questions .",
    "we write the first question in full as @xmath107 :  is the system in either state @xmath108 or @xmath109 ? \" , and in abbreviated form as @xmath110 .",
    "we use  @xmath111 \" to denote an affirmative answer to this question and  @xmath112 \" to denote a negative outcome .",
    "an observer s score is calculated using the sum of the probability of attaining a positive answer @xmath113 , for each question @xmath114 and can be interpreted as the number of questions answered affirmatively . to win it is sufficient to maximize your score . in this convention",
    "the remaining questions are @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . because the outcomes @xmath119 and @xmath120 are mutually exclusive at most @xmath109 questions can be answered affirmatively and @xmath121 this is known as wright s inequality @xcite .",

    "all optical experiments offer a platform where the no - disturbance condition can be reliably satisfied , however the detection loophole is a more prominent issue . here",
    "the detection loophole requires us to make auxiliary assumptions about the putative measurement outcomes of lost photons .",
    "we must assume that the measurement statistics collected during successful runs fairly representant both detected and lost photons .",
    "this becomes an implicit assumption when a statistically significant proportion of photons are lost .",
    "an interesting development in all optical implementations is that all four levels of the two qubit system can be encoded in a single photons .",
    "this requires both path and polarization modes of the photon to be used .",
    "both degrees of freedom span a @xmath109-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "one realization would be to introduce a beam splitter and use the encoding @xmath282 where @xmath283 and @xmath284 are the transmitted and reflected paths of the photon , while @xmath285 and @xmath103 are two independent linear polarization states .",
    "this development makes it possible to test contextuality of an indivisible quantum system , thereby guaranteeing that any violation of inequality ( [ mp - square ] ) can not be due to entanglement between the two qubits .",
    "an all optical experimental test of this inequality was carried out by anselmen et al . for a collection of 20 different single - photon states , they observed violation of the inequality by @xmath286 on average @xcite .",
    "corroboration of these results was found by o. moussa et al . who used nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to test the inequality for an ensemble of nuclear spins in a macroscopic single crystal of malonic acid ( @xmath287 ) @xcite .",
    "a small fraction ( @xmath288 ) of the molecules in this solid state sample were triply labeled with @xmath289 to form an ensemble of processor molecules . in this environment violation up to @xmath290 was detected .      in subsection [ sec : statedepandindep ] we explained how to go from state - independent to state - dependent inequalities by restricting the number of observables .",
    "these results have been applied to experimental work on mermin - peres square operators .",
    "here we highlight an experiment based on a state - dependent inequality derived from equation ( [ mp - square ] ) by a priori assigning values of @xmath291 to certain observables .",
    "the theoretical process described in subsection [ sec : statedepandindep ] is physically implemented by restricting the range of measurement settings .",
    "to illustrate these principles we consider an all optical experiment based on the inequality : @xmath292 which can be derived directly from equation ( [ mp - square ] ) by preassigning the value of @xmath293 @xcite .",
    "this inequality was experimentally tested on a two qubit system constructed from the polarization degrees of freedom of a pair of entangled photons @xcite .",
    "the state preparation phase of the experiment used spontaneous parametric down - conversion to generate two - photon product states which were subsequently manipulated by standard optical elements into the two - qubit state : @xmath294\\otimes \\left[\\cos\\frac{15\\pi}{8}|h\\rangle+\\sin\\frac{15\\pi}{8}|v\\rangle\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath295 and @xmath296 are horizontal and vertical polarization states . while the measurement process was implemented by the parity check technique , utilizing polarization beam splitters and half wave plates .",
    "the state @xmath48 saturates the quantum bound of equation ( [ eq : modifiedmerminperes ] ) placing a theoretical upper bound of @xmath137 on the detectable violation . in practice during the experiment , the hong - ou - mandel interference visibility was about @xmath297 such that the maximum violation achieved was @xmath298 .",
    "similar principles were experimentally tested on a single neutron system entangled in spin and path @xcite .",
    "the experiment focused on a collection of six observables given by pauli operators on the @xmath109-dimensional hilbert spaces spanned by the neutron spin ( s ) and path ( p ) degree of freedom respectively .",
    "the corresponding contextual inequality for these @xmath160 operators is : @xmath299 a neutron beam with a mean wavelength @xmath300 was selected by a si perfect crystal monochromator , to create a source of single neutrons which were subsequently prepared in maximally entangled bell - like state ( in the path and spin degrees of freedom ) . in the single neutron system the maximum experimental violation of the inequality was @xmath301 .",
    "these experimental implementations form an extensive body of evidence supporting the statement : it is not possible to preassigned noncontextual measurement outcomes to the mermin - peres square observables .",
    "contiguous experimental tests of quantum contextuality have been engineered from other contextual inequalities .",
    "we briefly highlight these endeavors by following a sequence of state - independent experiments .",
    "we will subsequently tackle their state - dependent counterparts .    to be theoretically capable of preforming a state - independent test of quantum contextuality on a @xmath302-dimensional system , you need at least @xmath303 rank-@xmath108 projectors @xcite .",
    "it follows that the minimal state - independent test of quantum contextuality requires @xmath304 observables since @xmath305-dimensional systems are the smallest contextual systems . a condition satisfied by inequality ( [ eq:13projectorinequality ] ) .",
    "this has inspired a body of theoretical and experimental work on yu and oh s 13 projector inequality @xcite .    in the experimental arena c. zu et al .",
    "@xcite tested the inequality on a single photonic qutrit .",
    "the three level system was constituted by three different spatial paths of a photon .",
    "a single 800 nm photon was conditionally obtained by a spontaneous parametric down conversion process and subsequently manipulated using half - wave plates and polarization beam splitters . theoretically inequality ( [ eq:13projectorinequality ] ) is violated by all qutrits states which uniformly attain the quantum bound of @xmath193 .",
    "this quantum bound is only @xmath306 beyond the classical bound imposed by non - contextual hidden variable theory ; attesting to the high precision attained by c. zu et al . who successfully demonstrated experimental violation for a collection of quantum states @xcite .",
    "in the theoretical arena the 13 projector state - independent inequality was further developed by kleinmann et al .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "the emphasis was on developing a tight variant of inequality ( [ eq:13projectorinequality ] ) .",
    "while violation of a contextual inequality decisively refutes the existence of noncontextual hidden variables ; compliance with a full complement of tight inequalities furnish sufficient conditions to prove noncontextual hidden variables exists .",
    "kleinmann et al .",
    "developed two tight variants of this inequality which have the general format of equation ( [ eq : kleinmanninequality ] ) .",
    "one advantage of the tight inequality is the ten percent gap between the noncontextual hidden variable bound of @xmath307 and the quantum bound of @xmath308 ; making it easier to experimentally demonstrate violation of this inequality .",
    "such an experimental implementation was undertaken using a single @xmath309yb@xmath310 ion trapped in a four - rods radio frequency trap @xcite .",
    "the three internal atomic energy levels of ground state of the ion are mapped directly to the three levels of the qutrit system . for eleven different states , x. zhang et al . showed violation of the inequality by as much as @xmath311 @xcite .",
    "again the results from this ion trap experiment were free from the detection loophole but could not directly close the disturbed hidden variables loophole .    to finish our discussion of state - independent experiments we hight an interesting parallel development by v. dambrosio et al .",
    "@xcite who experimentally tested the state - independent inequality : @xmath312 where @xmath97 is the vertex set of figure [ fig : cabellorefpic ] .",
    "consider a collection of eighteen events , @xmath313 , with exclusivity relations summarized by ( an exclusivity graph isomorphic to ) figure [ fig : cabellorefpic ] .",
    "equation ( [ eq : cabellosexperiment ] ) is tantamount to the statement that in any noncontextual hidden variable theory at most four of these events can happen at the same time .",
    "we note that , this inequality can be derived by rewriting equation ( [ sic ] ) in terms of the projectors @xmath314 .",
    "furthermore it has the fascinating interpretation of being the analogue of wright s inequality ( [ eq : wright ] ) for this state - independent scenario .",
    "v. dambrosio et al . @xcite experimentally violated this inequality by @xmath315 on average for 15 states of a four level quantum system encoded in the path and polarization degrees of freedom of a single photon ; an amount slightly above the quantum bound for equation ( [ eq : cabellosexperiment ] ) .",
    "this discrepancy arose because the exclusivity relations were not perfectly implemented in the experiment , causing a small level of coincidence of exclusive events .",
    "it remains to discuss state - dependent experimental tests of quantum contextuality .",
    "this scenario is especially interesting because it covers experimental tests with the fewest measurement settings .",
    "the minimum number of observables capable of exhibiting contextuality is five .",
    "this follows from the analysis of complementarity relation graphs in subsection [ sec : complementarity ] which demonstrated that @xmath151 and @xmath137-cycle complementarity graphs describe the simplest and smallest collections of contextual observables . in the four observable scenario - where the complementarity relations induce the chsh inequality for a pair of qubits - violation of the contextual inequality",
    "is usually attributed to entanglement .",
    "therefore in a single quantum system the pursuit of testing quantum contextuality using the least measurement settings has focused on the five observable kcbs inequality ( [ eq : klyachkoccorrelationineq ] ) .",
    "the first experimental tests of the kcbs inequality used a single photon heralded source and standard optical elements to create a three level system encoded in a subspace of equation ( [ eq : encodinghilbertspace ] ) @xcite .",
    "the kcbs inequality requires all five observables to be measured in two different contexts , this was implemented using a triplet of detectors which simultaneously measured pairs of observables belonging to the correlation terms @xmath316 in equation ( [ eq : klyachkoccorrelationineq ] ) .",
    "however for a specific observable , @xmath107 , there was disruption to the state of the observable between the points at which the two different contextual measurements occurred .",
    "this forced r. lapkiewicz et al . to test a variant of the kcbs inequality @xmath317 which included an experimentally measurable error term , @xmath318 , reflecting the discrepancy between the state of the observable @xmath107 measured in the context of @xmath319 and the state @xmath320 measured in the context of @xmath261 @xcite . in practice",
    "this error was @xmath321 .",
    "a violation of @xmath322 was attained .",
    "recently j. ahrens et al .",
    "experimentally implemented the kcbs inequality without introducing any error terms @xcite .",
    "the all optical scheme was based on sequential measurements or pairs of compatible observables , @xmath323 in equation ( [ eq : klyachkoccorrelationineq ] ) .",
    "this allowed the compatability of observables to be checked by inverting the order of sequential measurement and checking whether the outcome ( level of violation of the kcbs inequality ) was effected @xcite .",
    "the obtained experimental violation was @xmath324 which is just below the quantum bound of @xmath325 for the kcbs inequality . due to the close relationship between the kcbs inequality and wright s inequality ( [ eq : wright ] ) this experiment simultaneously tested wright s inequality .",
    "the experimental violation of wright s inequality , @xmath326 , was slightly higher than the maximum quantum bound , @xmath327 .",
    "again this circumstance was engendered by the lack of perfect exclusivity in the experimental implementation , resulting in a low level of coincidence between mutually exclusive events .",
    "these results were corroborated by xi kong et al . who tested wright s formulation of the kcbs inequality ( [ eq : wright ] ) using a single negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond @xcite .",
    "the nv center was composed of an impurity nitrogen and a neighbor vacancy .",
    "a gauss magnetic field was used to split the electron energy level scheme of the nv defect creating a spin-1 system .",
    "compatible measurements were performed by pulse sequences .",
    "a violation of the inequality by up to @xmath328 was achieved for the neutrally polarized state identified with the five fold symmetry axis of the kcbs pentagram . the extremely high experimentally measured violation ( 2.221 is only slightly below the quantum bound of @xmath327 ) is partially due to the imperfect implementation of the no - disturbance condition , symptomatic of a experimentally detected nonzero overlap between orthogonal projectors of @xmath329 on average .",
    "already these ideas have been transferred into the search for applications of experimental quantum contextuality .",
    "deng et al .",
    "demonstrated that violation of the kcbs inequality can be used to certify a lower bound on the degree of randomness of measurement outcomes for a single qutrit @xcite .",
    "a single @xmath330 photon which was conditionally obtained by a spontaneous parametric down conversion process and then put into a superposition of three different paths using half - wave plates and polarization beam splitters .",
    "the purpose of the experiment was to demonstrate violation of the kcbs s inequality guaranteed a certain confidence level of randomness @xcite .",
    "moreover , it was suggested that the bound on genuine randomness is given by the level of violation of the kcbs inequality .",
    "the randomness of the output string was quantified by the min - entropy .",
    "this implementation could generate approximately @xmath331 net random bits with @xmath332 confidence level .",
    "the level of violation of the inequality obtained was within the interval @xmath333 to @xmath334",
    ".    concurrent work by e. amselem et al . experimentally demonstrated violation of inequality ( [ eq : cabelloexperiment ] ) using a four level system encoded in the polarization and spatial path of a single photon as outlined in equation ( [ eq : encodinghilbertspace ] ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath335 _ nm _ single - photon source was emitted by a diode laser and measured by free space displaced sagnac interferometers .",
    "the visibility of the interferometers ranged between @xmath336 and @xmath337 allowing violation of the inequality by up to @xmath338 for the quantum state @xmath339 .",
    "however the implementation was susceptible to the disturbed hidden variable loophole due to the slight incompatibility of sequential measurements .",
    "in the present work we have surveyed the evolution of contextuality from its conception as a purely mathematical theorem to the empirically testable phenomenon that was recently verified in laboratories .",
    "we showed that quantum contextuality is a general framework treating quantum correlations on equal footing , regardless of whether they occur between many parts of a composite system , or between properties of a single object .",
    "finally , we also highlighted some prominent directions in contemporary research topics .",
    "quantum nonlocality evolved in a similar way from the early metaphysics to experimental verification in 1980 s .",
    "the breakthrough for quantum nonlocality was its application to cryptography @xcite and the invention of the quantum teleportation protocol @xcite which was a catalyst for the birth of quantum information theory .",
    "we believe that at the moment we are in the eve of such breakthrough for quantum contextuality .",
    "one of the most important open problems in contextuality is its general applicability in quantum information theory .",
    "interestingly , the special case of nonlocality is a well established resource .",
    "this nonclassical resource is intertwined with classical resources for communication .",
    "for example , it was shown that nonlocality can be simulated with communication @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is also known that nonlocality is a useful resource in communication related problems .    on the other hand",
    ", there is very little known about the relation between general contextuality and other information theoretic resources .",
    "recently , it was proposed that contextuality for a single ( local ) system can be simulated in realistic theories if one uses additional memory resources @xcite . by analogy to nonlocality , it is therefore possible that contextuality might be useful in some memory related tasks , however we need to learn more about the fundamental properties of contextuality before an affirmative answer can be given .",
