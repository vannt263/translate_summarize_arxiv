    "the discovery that the _ cos - b _ gamma - ray source was a pulsar ( psr b1706 - 44 ) was made by johnston et al ( 1992 ) .",
    "mcadam , osborne , & parkinson ( 1993 ) published a map made by the most telescope at 843  mhz of the area around the gamma - ray source .",
    "it showed a semicircular arc of emission , which has subsequently been denoted as the supernova remnant ( snr ) g343.1 - 2.3 , with the pulsar seemingly embedded in a small feature at its south eastern extremity .",
    "it was argued that the approximate distance of 3  kpc for the remnant , derived from the surface brightness - diameter relationship ( @xmath0-d ) was not incompatible with the pulsar s dispersion measure , although the distance indicated by the widely used interstellar electron density model of taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) would be only 1.8  kpc .",
    "the @xmath0-d relationship was based on the flux values from single dish observations , as both the vla and the most integrated flux fell short of what would be expected from these ( mcadam et al 1993 ) .    if the association of the pulsar and the supernova remnant were real a transverse velocity of @xmath1  kms@xmath2",
    "would be required for the pulsar to have moved from the approximate geometric centre of the snr arc in the characteristic spin down time of 17  kyr .",
    "this is a high value but not the highest measured value for a pulsar nor as high as that implied for some seemingly well - established pulsar - snr associations .",
    "frail , goss , & whiteoak ( 1994 ) mapped the area around the pulsar at 20  cm and 90  cm with the vla and cast some doubt on it s association with g343.1 - 2.3 based on the morphology , and the argument that the dispersion measure and @xmath0-d distance were discrepant .",
    "the latter was subsequently countered by a 21  cm hydrogen line absorption measurement of the pulsar by koribalski et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) which gives a distance range of 2.4 to 3.2  kpc .",
    "nicastro , johnston , & koribalski ( 1996 ) also argue against the association .",
    "they report a maximum value only 27  kms@xmath2 for the magnitude of the transverse velocity of the pulsar calculated from the interstellar scintillation .",
    "however in both dodson ( 1997 ) and then their later paper ( johnston , nicastro , & koribalski 1998 ) this estimate is revised up to 100  kms@xmath2 .",
    "the possibility of a direct determination of the proper motion of psr b1706 - 44 has been investigated , but no phase reference sufficiently strong for the current australian vlbi network ( the lba ) could be found .",
    "we have made a number of radio images of the remnant to determine its full extent .",
    "these are with mrt at 150  mhz , with the atca at 1400  mhz and at 6.6  ghz with the 26 m dish at mt pleasant observatory , hobart .",
    "the object as seen at 150  mhz , and at 6.6  ghz are shown in figure [ fig : mrt+mtp ] .",
    "the 150-mhz map is a preliminary result from the mrt all sky survey .",
    "the 6.6-ghz image was produced as part of the honours thesis of m. howlett ( howlett 1998 ) , a survey along the galactic plane using the 26 m antenna run by the university of tasmania .",
    "both contain all spatial frequencies up to their resolution .",
    "they both show broad extended structure to the south of the bright arc seen by most .",
    "the australia telescope compact array has been use to re - observe g343.1 - 2.3 , with a nineteen pointing mosaic .",
    "mosaicing was required to cover the extent of the source , but also to assist in the recovery of the flux on the shortest _ uv _ spacings , which were missed in the most and the vla observations .",
    "the images in figure [ fig : at_i ] a ) , look very much like those of most and indeed have very similar resolution ( @xmath3 ) ( the longer baselines , to the 6 km antenna , were not used due to their poor support ) .",
    "we have included as a constraint in the deconvolution the observed total flux for the snr , 30 jy , as seen with the 26 m single dish in hobart .",
    "figure [ fig : at_i ] b ) shows the polarisation angle overlaid on the polarised intensity .",
    "the polarised fraction is typically about 20 per cent and the polarisation angle is randomly orientated and changes rapidly around the bright ring .",
    "wisps of polarised emission can be seen to extend beyond the ring as originally defined , and throughout the region with broadscale emission .",
    "this confirms that the broadscale emission is associated with the synchrotron emission from the snr .",
    "it is instructive to compare the vla maps of figure 4 in frail et al ( 1994 ) with the map in figure [ fig : at_i ] a ) .",
    "the spur of emission on which the pulsar lies is clearly a continuous feature covering more than @xmath4 .",
    "this makes it extremely unlikely to be a cometary tail from the pulsar .",
    "furthermore the width of the spur , @xmath5 , is unlikely to be that due to ram pressure of a moving pulsar .",
    "it is intriguing this approximately the size that would be expected from a static pulsar wind , i.e. the sedov equations with a continuous input of energy , with the @xmath6 of psr1706 - 44 ( rees & gunn 1974 ) .",
    "the arguments against the association were based around kaspi s critia ( kaspi 1996 ) .",
    "these were that the pulsar dm distance and the snr @xmath0-d distance did not match , and the pulsar was at the edge of the snr and had too low a velocity to have travelled from the geometric centre of the snr .",
    "also there was no morphological evidence to imply a velocity direction .",
    "it has turned out that it is the dm distance is incorrect , and the extent of the snr has been underestimated .",
    "it is clear from both the low total flux values found by the most and vla maps that there is a smooth broad component to this snr .",
    "the atca observations confirm the extent of the broad emission , and that this is syncrotron in character . taking this smooth component as the true limits of the snr enlarges the extent and moves it southwards .",
    "this places the pulsar psr1706 - 44 within the snr shell , rather than on the rim .",
    "we expect a snr to be associated with psr1706 - 44 because of its youth .",
    "the association was rejected in the past , and we have shown that the grounds for the rejection are not compelling as previously believed . the question of the pulsar velocity could be resolved by finding a phase reference for vlbi observation , with either the ska or an upgrade to the current lba .",
    "we will be able to rule out the upper velocity limits with the atca within the next few years but will not be able to measure to the lower limits for a few decades ."
