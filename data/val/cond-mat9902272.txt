    "already 20 years ago , the physics around the spin - peierls transition fascinated many researchers ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    "the incommensurably modulated i phase attracted much interest ( e.g. @xcite ) . yet detailed experimental investigations of the nature of this phase were not possible at that time . the first spin - peierls transition in an inorganic compound , cugeo@xmath0 ,",
    "was found only five years ago @xcite .",
    "this made a multitude of experimental investigations possible ( for a review , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in particular , direct x - ray experiments in the i phase",
    "were performed by kiryukhin and keimer which permitted for the first time to detect the incommensurability of the distortion in @xmath1-space @xcite .",
    "even more , it was possible to look at the structure of the soliton lattice modulation by measuring the intensity of the third harmonic @xcite .    on the other side ,",
    "fagot - revurat et al.@xcite were able to measure the distribution of local magnetizations in cugeo@xmath0 in a beautiful nmr experiment . in a refined version",
    "it was now possible to deduce from such results the shape and the amplitude of the magnetic part of a soliton @xcite .",
    "three discrepancies to the conventional theories became apparent .",
    "the first concerns the amplitudes of the local magnetizations which is experimentally found to be much lower ( factor 4 to 6 ) than predicted .",
    "second , the x - ray soliton width ( @xmath2 ) is appreciably larger than the nmr soliton width ranging from 6 to 10 .",
    "third , the widths are all larger than the ones theoretically predicted .    in the present work",
    "we will solve the first two discrepancies and argue with zang et al .",
    "@xcite that the remaining problems are connected to the neglect of interchain couplings .    to fix the diction",
    "let us state that we use the term soliton for the combination of a zero in the modulated distortion _ and _ the concomitant localized , bound spinon @xcite .",
    "the distortive soliton width is the width of the kink - like zero of the modulated distortions .",
    "the magnetic soliton width is the spatial width of the local magnetizations @xcite .",
    "the incommensurate modulation in the i phase is viewed as an equidistant array ( lattice ) of solitons .    the paper is set up as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss the fact that the nmr line widths are much smaller than the theoretical ones and give an explanation for it in terms of the zero - point motion of the soliton lattice .",
    "direct numerical calculations based on dmrg are shown in section iii .",
    "they permit to address the second main point , namely the discrepancy between the soliton widths as measured by x - ray and by nmr . in section",
    "iv a detailed comparison to recent experimental data @xcite will be presented .",
    "the concluding section contains a discussion of the open questions , namely the role of interchain couplings , and a summary of our results .",
    "in ref . @xcite the results were interpreted by fitting them to a hartree - fock theory of fujita and machida @xcite .",
    "fujita and machida did not take into account that the expectation values which occur in the hartree - fock self - consistency problem become non - uniform in a non - uniform phase @xcite .",
    "thus they missed the important point that the local magnetizations @xmath3 are so strongly alternating that they are even antiparallel on every second site to the applied external magnetic field .",
    "the amplitude of the alternating component is strongly enhanced compared to the xy model as was predicted in a number of investigations @xcite .",
    "theoretically , there is no doubt that the _ spin - isotropic _ model has to be used to describe cuprate systems .",
    "experimentally , however , the amplitude of an xy model fits much better than the enhanced amplitude of the isotropic xyz model . the discrepancy can be explained by the fluctuations of soliton lattice which are induced by the presence of the so - called phasons @xcite .",
    "the importance of zero - point motion of the _ crystal lattice _ in peierls systems was already noted by mckenzie and wilkins @xcite . in the present work",
    "we will focus on the zero - point motion of the phasons .",
    "the phasons are very similar to phonons .",
    "if the deviation from commensurability of the wave vector characterizing the modulation @xmath4 is small ( low soliton concentration ) and the soliton width @xmath5 is large a continuum approach can be used @xcite . in this approach",
    "the discreteness of the underlying lattice does not appear .",
    "thus the continuum hamiltonian is invariant under continuous translations along the chains .",
    "the incommensurate modulation breaks this continuous symmetry giving rise to goldstone bosons , the so - called phasons @xcite .",
    "they refer to oscillations of the solitons about the equilibrium positions in their lattice just as phonons refer to oscillations of the atoms about the equilibrium positions in the crystal lattice .",
    "there is one important difference between phonons and phasons .",
    "there exist in general three phonon branches ( 2 transversal , 1 longitudinal ) corresponding to the three spatial dimensions into which an atom can be moved .",
    "but there is only one phason branch since the modulation can only be moved along the chains .",
    "note that this does _ not _ concern the fact that the phasons have a nondegenerate dispersion @xmath6 which depends on a three dimensional vector @xmath7 .",
    "like phonons the dispersion is linear in @xmath7 for small values of @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath8 in the notation of ref .",
    "hence , the phasons give rise to a @xmath9 contribution in the specific heat @xcite which is indeed experimentally observed @xcite .    before we proceed",
    "further we discuss briefly the effect of pinning .",
    "first we like to emphasize that there are two possible sources of pinning .",
    "the first one is pinning to the discrete lattice structure .",
    "the second is pinning to defects .",
    "the first mechanism enters since the continuous translational invariance along the chains is given only in the continuum treatment which represents a certain approximation .",
    "so the phasons are only _ quasi _ goldstone bosons of a _ quasi _ continuous symmetry breaking . yet treating the incommensurate modulations as continuously translational invariant , i.e. shifting them without energy cost , is an excellent approximation if the solitonic width @xmath5 is not too small .",
    "in the course of our previous calculations @xcite we noted that the energy difference between a modulation with the zero _ on _ a site and a modulation with the zero _ between _ two sites is of the order @xmath10 where @xmath11 is some constant of the order of the inverse lattice constant @xmath12 in chain direction . hence , for @xmath13 this energy difference becomes negligibly small .",
    "from the experimental point of view we come to the same conclusion .",
    "if there were a pinning of the modulation to the lattice structure the modulation would be commensurate with a period @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an integer .",
    "this would imply that at most @xmath15 discrete local magnetization values @xmath16 occur .",
    "the experimental resolution , however , is sufficiently high to exclude this scenario since _ not _ a number of isolated peaks but a continuous distribution is observed in the nmr response @xcite .    the second mechanism is pinning to defects which break the translational invariance . such an effect is certainly present but it is negligibly small in the pure samples . to obtain an estimate we argue that the defect concentration @xmath17 corresponds to a typical distance between two defects of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the lattice constant in chain direction",
    "this means that phasons with a wave vector below @xmath20 do not exist .",
    "this can be viewed as the effect of a gap @xmath21 induced by defect pinning . from eq .",
    "( [ omegabhatt ] ) we obtain the estimate @xmath22 where we used @xmath23 , @xmath24k , @xmath25 nm @xcite and @xmath26 nm @xcite .",
    "an upper bound for the defect concentration @xmath17 in the pure samples investigated is @xmath27 .",
    "so the defect pinning gap @xmath21 is lower than @xmath28k .",
    "we conclude that defect pinning will become important only below @xmath29k and does not need to be considered here .",
    "the soliton comprises a zero of the modulated distortions and a spinon bound to this zero @xcite .",
    "if there is a zero - point motion of the phasons this implies a certain motion of both the lattice distortions and the magnetic structure .",
    "it is plausible to assume that a certain _ averaging _ occurs which reduces the amplitude of the alternating magnetizations .",
    "this idea was first introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the difference between observed and computed magnetization pattern .",
    "( note that kiryukhin et al .",
    "@xcite discussed a certain phasonic averaging linked to _",
    "defects_. our approach does not rely on defects . ) here we present the detailed calculation and further estimates .",
    "let us assume that the local magnetizations @xmath16 can be described by two smoothly varying functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 which provide the alternating and the non - alternating component , respectively @xmath32 where we set the lattice constant to unity and @xmath33 denotes the component along the chains .",
    "the continuum approach results @xcite are in fact of the form ( [ outset1 ] ) .",
    "( [ outset1 ] ) is the adiabatic result describing the completely static situation without phasons .",
    "let us introduce now the phase variable @xmath34 where we use the hat to indicate that it is an operator as is the position of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "thus ( [ outset1 ] ) becomes @xmath35 in principle , the shift @xmath34 has to be inserted in the functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 as well .",
    "but these functions are slowly varying so that the influence of the shift on them is negligible .",
    "assuming furthermore that the nmr experiments measure on a relatively long time scale we conclude that the local magnetization @xmath38 seen in experiment is simply the expectation value @xmath39 in the harmonic approximation the phase fluctuations are interactionless bosons and the operators @xmath34 are linear combinations of the bosonic creation and annihilation operators .",
    "then it is straightforward to compute the expectation value of the cosine    [ outset4 ] @xmath40    since the dominant fluctuations are those at long wave lengths the dependence of @xmath41 on the site index @xmath42 should not be important .",
    "hence we introduce @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the number of sites in one chain . the reduction factor",
    "@xmath45 is similar to a debye - waller factor which accounts for the non - vanishing atomic motion due to phonons .",
    "it reduces the amplitude of the alternating component only . from eqs .",
    "( [ outset2],[outset3],[outset4],[outset5 ] ) we find @xmath46 where the essential amendment compared to ( [ outset1 ] ) is the reduction of the alternating component by @xmath45 .",
    "it is plausible to explain the discrepancy between experimental and adiabatic theoretical amplitude by the zero - point motion of the phasons which leads to a finite value of @xmath41 and hence to @xmath47 .",
    "we will present further support for this idea in section iv .    before turning to estimates for @xmath45",
    "we point out how one can take the reduction @xmath45 into account if the result of the adiabatic calculation is _ not _ given in the form ( [ outset1 ] ) but as a set of discrete values @xmath48 .",
    "this is the case for any direct adiabatic numerical treatment ( see , e.g. , section iii ) which does not use the continuum approach .",
    "then one has to deduce in a first step estimates for the slowly varying functions @xmath36 and @xmath37 from the @xmath16 . the most natural way to do",
    "this is by taking local averages    @xmath49    after application of @xmath45 to @xmath37 as in ( [ result0 ] ) one obtains    @xmath50    with @xmath51 .",
    "( [ former ] ) is at the basis of the averaging of adjacent sites which we used previously @xcite .",
    "_ even average completely over two adjacent sites @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "now we turn to the calculation of @xmath45 . expressing the expectation value in the exponent in momentum space yields    @xmath53    where we used @xmath54 with the mass @xmath55 .",
    "the first term in the bracket in ( [ result1 ] ) stands for the zero - point motion since it survives even for @xmath56 .",
    "the second term in the bracket is the bosonic occupation number at finite temperature .",
    "rearranging the exponentials yields    [ w1 ] @xmath57    where @xmath58 stands for the volume per spin site .",
    "for a comparison with experimental data we can focus on the low - temperature behaviour of ( [ w1 ] ) .",
    "a close inspection of ( [ w1 ] ) reveals that @xmath59 where @xmath60 is constant and @xmath61 is of order @xmath62 . with the help of the input from ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath60 and @xmath61 are determined in the appendix .",
    "one obtains    @xmath63    where @xmath64 is the singlet - triplet gap and @xmath65 and @xmath66 a characteristic length and characteristic energy per volume , respectively , defined and given in ref .",
    "the value of @xmath60 for cugeo@xmath0 is @xmath67 and the characteristic temperature @xmath68 is @xmath69k .",
    "the value of @xmath60 leads to a reduction of the alternating component @xmath70 and the parameter @xmath71 takes the value @xmath72 .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the values @xmath73 and @xmath74 which we found previously by fitting theory to experiment @xcite .",
    "further support is gained from the estimate for @xmath68 . in fig .",
    "[ fig - tempdepend ] the temperature dependence of the widths @xmath75 of the nmr lines are shown which are dominated by the alternating component .",
    "hence they are expected to be proportional to @xmath76 to which they are compared .",

    "title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    the small number of data points at low @xmath77 does not allow for a complete quantitative test of the theoretical prediction . but the order of magnitude of the reduction of the line width at low temperatures is the correct one .    if there were an adiabatic treatment of the incommensurate phase at finite temperatures this would yield a line width which saturates _ exponentially _ at low temperatures due to the gap in the spin system @xcite .",
    "[ fig - tempdepend ] indicates clearly that there is _ no _ exponential saturation of the line width for @xmath56 , but a behaviour @xmath78 .",
    "this is a direct evidence for the presence of low - lying , gapless fluctuations .",
    "the quadratic behaviour in @xmath77 of the decrease corroborates the result ( [ twidth ] ) and hence the existence of a three - dimensional nondegenerate dispersion .    at temperatures closer to the transition",
    "the line width is reduced much more strongly .",

    "here we present some numerical results obtained by dmrg .",

    "numerically , this is achieved by iteration . since it is found that an array of equidistant solitons represents the energetically most favorable configuration @xcite we use as initial distortion @xmath81 with @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the average magnetization or @xmath84 .",
    "after about 10 iterations , one reaches a stable distortion pattern .",
    "this pattern shows no discernible differences depending on which start configuration has been used .    for the calculation of the lowest state with @xmath85 for a given modulation we use the finite size algorithm @xcite . in each iteration",
    "we keep @xmath86 states .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied .",
    "keeping @xmath87 states leads to a change of the calculated energy of the order of @xmath88 . for large chain lengths and large dimerizations the energy change due to",
    "a change of the distance by a few sites between two neighboring solitons is very small .",
    "this is due to the exponential localization of the solitons .",
    "so care has to be taken to avoid spurious shifts which hinder the following fit analysis .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - k18 ] the local distortions and the local magnetizations are shown as they are found after the procedure described above .",

    "the periodicity @xmath15 of the solitons is fixed by the average magnetization @xmath94 which results in the relation defining the soliton widths @xmath95 and @xmath96 as a function of @xmath15 and @xmath97 @xmath98 another relation can be deduced from the average of the @xmath99-function which is @xmath100 @xcite which in the continuum limit is related to the average magnetization .",
    "one obtains @xmath101 a relation which was well fulfilled ( within 1 to 4% ) by our fit parameters .",

    "the magnetic soliton width @xmath95 , is too low by about 20% .    choosing , however , a larger dimerization ( the corresponding small @xmath126 , respectively ) , which reproduces the gap value resulting from averaging the dispersion @xmath6 perpendicular to the chains along @xmath155 @xcite , leads to larger amplitudes @xmath75 and @xmath90 .",
    "these larger amplitudes can be nicely reconciled with the experimental findings by a value very close to @xmath154 .",
    "this is essentially what was done in the previous work @xcite .",
    "the argument in favor of the larger gap is that the neglect of the interchain coupling would lead to this larger gap @xcite .",
    "but the corresponding soliton widths would be even lower ( see eq .",
    "( [ solwidth ] ) ) and hence in worse agreement with experiment .",
    "we conclude from this that it is not just a question of fine - tuning the constants to achieve agreement .",
    "the purely @xmath156 model is _ not _ sufficient .",
    "the magnetic interchain couplings have to be taken into account as has become already apparent from the two ways to choose the relevant gap .",
    "the magnetic interchain coupling has the two following effects .",
    "first , it reduces the observed gap value for a given dimerization @xcite .",
    "thus a larger dimerization ( smaller @xmath126 ) should be used .",
    "this is consistent with a number of recent investigations @xcite .",
    "the larger gap will lead to larger amplitudes .",
    "second , zang et al .",
    "@xcite argued that the interchain coupling _ enhances _ the soliton widths which is exactly what is needed to reconcile theory and experiment .",
    "this enhancement is qualitatively easy to understand since an interchain coupling will favor the appearance of staggered magnetization .",
    "regions of staggered magnetization are those were the solitons are , see fig .",
    "[ fig - k18 ] .",
    "so these regions are extended which implies an enhancement of the soliton width . hence , we come to the conclusion that a larger dimerization ( smaller @xmath126 ) plus an appropriate treatment of the interchain couplings should yield results in quantitative agreement with experiment",
    ". there are also preliminary results indicating that the inclusion of interchain coupling changes the increase of @xmath95 as function of @xmath83 to a decrease which is what is experimentally seen ( cf .",
    "[ fig - soliton - m ] ) .",
    "summarizing , two main points are shown in the present work .",
    "the first is the importance of the phasonic fluctuations providing a natural explanation for the large amplitude differences between theory and experiment .",
    "the second is the difference between distortive ( @xmath96 ) and magnetic ( @xmath95 ) soliton width leading to a ratio @xmath139 between @xmath157 and @xmath158 depending on frustration .",
    "further work to include interchain coupling is called for .",
    "based on eq .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) and ref .",
    "@xcite we present here estimates for the two leading contributions @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "focussing on the low - lying excitations we adopt ( [ omegabhatt ] ) even though we do not know whether at larger values of @xmath7 the dispersion is still described by ( [ omegabhatt ] ) .",
    "the mass density @xmath159 is proportional to @xmath160 .",
    "if each spin site moved in the same way on shifting the modulation @xmath161 were reasonable .",
    "since , however , the modulation does _ not _ have the same amplitude for _ all _ sites an effective reduction has to be taken into account .",
    "for sinusoidal modulation this factor is 1/2 , i.e. @xmath162 , due to the average value of @xmath163 . for all other modulations",
    "the reduction factor will be between 1/2 and 1 ; we choose 1/2 since the higher harmonic content of the modulation is very small @xcite .",
    "we estimate @xmath60 , the zero temperature reduction due to the zero - point motion of the phasons .",
    "it is difficult to compute @xmath60 reliably since , in principle , information of _ all _ the phasons is required , not only the lowest lying ones . but an estimate which determines the order of magnitude is possible by using an upper cutoff @xmath173 as in the debye model of phonons @xcite .",
    "we start with          eqs .",
    "( [ w1],[kmax ] ) and the singlet - triplet gap @xmath176 @xcite together lead finally to ( [ width ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the volume per spin site can be found from the lattice constants by @xmath177 with @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath180 @xcite .",
    "the division by 2 is necessary since there are two cu ions in each unit cell .",
    "next we compute @xmath61 where we are only interested in the leading temperature dependence .",
    "thus the result depends only on the lowest lying excitations and the assumption of a dispersion as ( [ omegabhatt ] ) is well justified ."
