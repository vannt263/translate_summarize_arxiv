    "cold atoms in harmonic traps and optical lattices continue to be an important controllable system for investigations into various properties of condensed matter .",
    "a case in point is the direct observation of anderson localization@xcite of matter waves by several experimental groups @xcite in recent years . that the anderson localization is a strongly dimension dependant phenomenon was recognized early on@xcite .",
    "an infinitesimal random disorder localizes all the single particle states in two and lower dimensions@xcite ( see also the note in ref .",
    "this also rules out the development of mobility edges in two and lower dimensions .",
    "however , if the disorder distribution is deterministic , it is possible to have extended states if the quasi - disorder strength ( @xmath1 ) is below a critical value ( @xmath2 ) , as is found in the one - dimensional aubry - andr ( aa ) model@xcite .",
    "recently , localization properties of non - interacting bosons loaded into a one - dimensional optical lattice with an aa quasi - disorder potential were experimentally investigated by the lens group@xcite .",
    "detailed theoretical studies of the aa model have been carried out both in the past@xcite and in the recent times@xcite ( for recent reviews see refs . ) . in the aa model , where the hopping is restricted to between nearest neighbors ( nn ) , all the single particle states remain extended for @xmath1 below @xmath2 and become localized above it , which implies , again , the absence of mobility edges . following a line of research into the effects of longer range hopping on the localization properties@xcite , recently it was discovered that the hopping beyond the nn can lead to the development of mobility edges in what may be called extended aa models@xcite .",
    "considering the fact that the aa model has already been realized in experiments and that the experimental investigations of various aspects of the localization phenomena using cold atoms is ongoing@xcite , further theoretical studies of the beyond - nn - effects on the localization and the bose condensation in extended aa models are certainly of current interest .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present some interesting results obtained in such an investigation .    in this paper",
    ", we study the effects of the nnn hopping on some properties of bosons in optical lattices with aa quasi - disorder without and with confining harmonic potentials . in the first part of this paper ,",
    "we investigate the effects of @xmath0 on the localization properties of a single boson employing the exact diagonalization method .",
    "we consider a single boson moving with nn and nnn hoppings in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) optical lattice with aa quasi - disorder .",
    "we will show that the sign of @xmath0 plays an important role on the localization .",
    "the numerical results obtained are supplemented with analytical results for the energy dependence and the @xmath0 dependence of the critical disorder strength required for the localization transition .",
    "we also compare some of the results obtained using periodic boundary conditions to those obtained employing open boundary conditions@xcite after including a harmonic potential , which is usually present in the experiments . in the second part of this paper , we consider a many boson system and study the effects of @xmath0 on the bose - einstein condensation .",
    "the condensate fraction is found to show a significant dependence on @xmath0 and the quasi - disorder strength .",
    "we also show that the phase of the aa potential has a significant effect on the condensate fraction .",
    "since we are dealing with a quasi - disordered system , it is appropriate for us to place this work in the larger field of the studies on the effects of random disorder on bose - einstein condensates .",
    "there have been extensive studies on the random disorder effects on interacting continuum bosons@xcite .",
    "these investigations found that the condensate fraction decreases with increasing disorder strength .",
    "further , recent studies on non - interacting lattice bosons@xcite reached the conclusion that the bose condensation temperature slightly enhances with disorder for large filling whereas it reduces for small filling .",
    "extensive studies have also been conducted on interacting disordered lattice bosons employing the bose - hubbard model and its variants@xcite . on the experimental front",
    ", it has been reported that the random disorder reduces the condensate fraction of lattice bosons in a harmonic trap@xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the numerical and the analytical studies on the single particle localization properties are presented in sec .",
    "the studies on the effect of @xmath0 on the bose - einstein condensation and the effects of the different phases of the aa potential are presented in sec .",
    "the conclusions are given in sec .",
    "in the first part of this section we study a lattice boson in the aa disorder potential .",
    "the hamiltonian of this system is : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a site index in a one - dimensional optical lattice with a lattice constant @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath0 are the nn and the nnn hopping matrix elements , @xmath7 is a creation operator for a boson at site @xmath4 , @xmath8 is the locator of a nn site , @xmath1 the strength of the aa potential , and @xmath9 = ( @xmath10 + 1)/2 is the incommensurability parameter .",
    "here @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 have energy units .",
    "all the energies in this paper are measured in units of @xmath11 .",
    "we note here that biddle _ et . al._@xcite",
    "have shown that , for positive @xmath6 and @xmath0 , the @xmath2 decreases with @xmath0 for low energy states while it increases for high energy states . in our studies",
    "we have considered both negative and positive @xmath0 values . in this paper ,",
    "the results presented for localization studies are for positive @xmath6 unless stated otherwise .",
    "we numerically diagonalize @xmath12 to obtain its eigenenergies and eigenfunctions .",

    "the ipr is defined by @xmath17    in fig . 1 , we have shown the variations of the s and the ipr of the ground state as a function of the quasi - disorder strength for various values of @xmath0 .",
    "the transition from the extended to the localized state is signaled by a large drop in @xmath18 and a large rise in ipr . in the absence of the nnn",
    "hopping , the transition occurs at a critical disorder strength @xmath19 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath2 changes as @xmath0 is introduced and the sign of @xmath0 has a significant effect on the localization transition .",

    "we have seen that the results do not depend on the sign of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "next we have studied the energy dependence of the @xmath2 .",
    "we generalize the definitions of s and ipr to excited states by replacing @xmath24 with corresponding excited state wave functions in eq .",
    "we have numerically obtained the @xmath2 for all the 233 eigenstates from the calculations of the @xmath25 as well as the @xmath26 as a function of @xmath1 as shown in fig . 2 for three states .",
    "for each eigenstate , the value of @xmath1 for which @xmath25 is minimum and @xmath26 is maximum is taken as the @xmath2 of that state and the corresponding eigenenergy is @xmath27 .",
    "we note here that @xmath25 is a better indicator of the localization transition compared to @xmath26 . in fig .",
    "3 , we have shown the variation of the @xmath2 with @xmath27 for @xmath0 = -0.1 .",
    "the @xmath2 is seen to decrease approximately linearly with increasing energy .",
    "it may be noted that for positive @xmath0 this trend is reverse@xcite .",
    "the numerical results obtained for negative @xmath0 can be understood from an extension of the analytical calculations given in ref . .",
    "we start with the following hamiltonian for an infinite system : @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the site indices and @xmath32= 0 or 1 . here , the hopping strength decreases exponentially with increasing distance and our choice ( eq .",

    "the relevance of this model in the context of ultracold atoms in optical lattices has been discussed in ref . .",

    "then @xmath18 reaches a peak and falls abruptly with increasing @xmath1 signifying localization of the wave function .",
    "the small enhancement of @xmath18 preceding the localization transition results from a competition between the aa potential trying to move the boson away from the center of the trap and the confining potential trying to bring it to the center of the trap , as explained in our earlier paper ( ref . ) .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study of the effects of the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) hopping ( @xmath0 ) on the properties of non - interacting bosons in optical lattices in the presence of an aubry - andr quasi - disorder . </S>",
    "<S> first we investigate , employing exact diagonalization , the effects of @xmath0 on the localization properties of a single boson . </S>",
    "<S> the localization is monitored using an entanglement measure as well as with inverse participation ratio . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sign of @xmath0 has a significant influence on the localization effects . </S>",
    "<S> we also provide analytical results in support of the trends found in the localization behavior . </S>",
    "<S> further , we extend these results including the effects of a harmonic potential which obtains in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> next , we study the effects of @xmath0 on bose - einstein condensation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , a positive @xmath0 strongly enhances the low temperature thermal depletion of the condensate while a negative @xmath0 reduces it . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that , for a fixed temperature , increasing the quasi - disorder strength reduces the condensate fraction in the extended regime while enhancing it in the localized regime . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the effects of boundary conditions and that of the phase of the aa potential on the condensate . </S>",
    "<S> these are found to have significant effects on the condensate fraction in the localization transition region . </S>"
