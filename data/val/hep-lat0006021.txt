    "af quantum field theories are relevant both in particle and in condensed matter physics .",
    "their standard formulation is based on a global ( @xmath3 spin models ) , or local ( @xmath4 gauge theories ) non - abelian continuous symmetry group . in this work",
    "we discuss a scenario which , beyond its field theoretical interest , might open new analytic and numerical ways to study such theories .",
    "lattice regularization allows ( both in spin and gauge models ) to replace the continuous symmetry group by one of its finite discrete non - abelian subgroups .",
    "the new model has a reduced symmetry and , due to the discreteness of the group , a finite action gap .",
    "if the bare coupling constant @xmath5 is large , then the fluctuations are large and these new features of the model will have a small effect . at small @xmath5",
    ", however , the finite action gap kills the fluctuations and the system will be frozen .",
    "we expect therefore a phase transition between the strong and weak coupling regions - possibly even two transitions , if there is a massless phase between them .",
    "as opposed to that , the original af model is expected to have a single phase only approaching the continuum limit as @xmath6 .",
    "denote the phase transition point at the end of the strong coupling phase of the discrete subgroup model by @xmath7 and assume that the transition is second order .",
    "( we shall discuss the case of a first order transition later . )",
    "we suggest that the quantum field theory obtained in the limit @xmath8 is in the same universality class as the original af model if the subgroup is sufficiently large .    in the early 80 s gauge models on discrete non - abelian subgroups",
    "were introduced as an _ approximation _ to the su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "that time it was considered as obvious that this is an approximation only since the wilson loop expectation values measured at some coupling @xmath5 were different .",
    "our suggestion above , however , refers to the situation when the discrete and continuous group models are compared at the same large correlation length ( approaching the continuum limit ) for physical quantities .",
    "a nice example , where a discrete internal symmetry of the action is elevated to a continuous symmetry , is the d=2 xy model . considering perturbations which break the o(2 ) symmetry down to z(@xmath9 ) in the massless low temperature phase , for @xmath10 the discrete symmetry is elevated to full o(2 ) in the long distance predictions if @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "our case is more complicated since af theories have a non - perturbative finite mass gap .",
    "we were inspired to investigate models with discrete subgroups through the observations made by patrascioiu and seiler a few years ago @xcite who noticed that , within the statistical errors , the physical results of the dodecahedron spin model for @xmath12 are consistent with that of the o(3 ) non - linear @xmath13-model .",
    "they concluded that the o(3 ) model should also have a phase transition and so , none of the two models is af .",
    "we believe that overwhelming evidence exists that the o(3 ) @xmath13-model is af and our suggestion implies that the dodecahedron model is also af .",
    "this statement should be understood in the sense that the _ physical _ running coupling goes to zero as the corresponding momentum scale goes to infinity .    if our suggestion is correct , the relation between the bare coupling of the original model and that of its discrete subgroup version is non - analytic .",
    "the standard arguments which demonstrate the universality of the first two terms in the beta function describing the change of the bare coupling under the change of the cut - off are not valid .",
    "there exists a special class of non - abelian subgroups , the dihedral subgroups of su(n ) which are not considered in this work .",
    "( the discrete subgroups of su(3 ) are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ) these subgroups can be made arbitrarily large and , although they do not go over to su(n ) in this limit , the action gap gets arbitrarily small . due to the fact that they inherit some of those properties of su(n ) which are thought to be relevant for confinement in the yang - mills theory , kaplan raised the possibility that they are in the universality class of su(n )  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate this scenario also .",
    "we studied discrete spin models where the symmetry group is one of the non - abelian subgroups of o(3 ) .",
    "these subgroups are the symmetry groups of regular polyhedra . embedding the regular polyhedron in @xmath14",
    "the corners define the discrete directions of the unit spin @xmath15 .",
    "we shall refer to the discrete spin model by the name of the corresponding polyhedron .",
    "for all the subgroups we used the standard nearest - neighbor action .",
    "we found that the spin models with small subgroups ( tetrahedron , octahedron and cube with 4 , 6 and 8 directions , respectively ) are definitely _ not _ equivalent to the o(3 ) non - linear @xmath13-model .",
    "the two largest subgroups ( icosahedron and dodecahedron with 12 and 20 directions , respectively ) could not be distinguished from the o(3 ) @xmath13-model , however . in particular , for the dodecahedron",
    "the agreement is established on the level of o(0.1% ) .",
    "it is easy to show that the tetrahedron model is identical to the @xmath16 potts model with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the cube model is the product of 3 independent ising models .",
    "this is obvious if one takes the 8 vectors pointing to the corners of the cube as @xmath19 .",
    "then the cube action becomes a sum of 3 independent ising actions , with the relation @xmath20 between the corresponding couplings .",
    "a lot is known about the @xmath16 potts and the ising model and we can certainly exclude that they are in the universality class of the o(3 ) @xmath13-model .",
    "we have chosen physical quantities which can be measured precisely : the finite - size scaling function , the renormalized zero momentum 4-point coupling @xmath21 and the same coupling in a finite physical volume .",
    "it is the latter quantity which can be measured with the highest precision .",
    "an @xmath22 periodic box is considered and the second moment correlation length @xmath23 is measured .",
    "the relative change of the correlation length when @xmath24 is doubled , @xmath25 is studied as the function of @xmath26 .",
    "both these ratios are physical quantities if @xmath24 and @xmath23 are much larger than the lattice unit @xmath27 .",
    "the finite - size scaling function is a valuable tool to connect the small and large volume regimes@xcite .",
    "this technique has been used very effectively by lscher , weisz and wolff@xcite in their study of the running coupling in the o(3 ) model .",
    "the finite - size scaling function has been measured precisely by caracciolo et al.@xcite in the same model for a large set of @xmath26 values , using the second - moment correlation length .",
    "the latter is defined in an @xmath22 box as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the 2-point spin correlation function in fourier space and @xmath30 .",
    "the finite - size scaling function was also studied for the @xmath16 potts model ( equivalent to the tetrahedron model ) by salas and sokal@xcite .",
    "the two functions are completely , even qualitatively different . the largest deviation between the o(3 ) and",
    "tetrahedron finite - size scaling curves is around @xmath31 .",
    "we have decided , therefore to study this function in the neighborhood of this value for the different subgroups as the continuum limit is approached .    in figure",

    "however , the result of the extrapolation to the continuum limit of present data depends much more on the ansatz used .",
    "below we present fits with different functional forms , together with the corresponding value of @xmath61 :    standard action : @xmath62 fp action @xmath63 dodecahedron action @xmath64    both from figure  [ fig : gra ] and these fits one concludes that an @xmath59 term is needed in the ansatz .",
    "( note the large coefficients in the @xmath65 type fits in the standard and dodecahedron action . )",
    "we shall return to the question of cut - off effects in the last section .",
    "the variation of the constant term in the fits represent the systematic error of @xmath52 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the statistical error .",
    "although it is somewhat arbitrary to represent this ( theoretical ) uncertainty by an error , based on these fits , we give the following estimates : @xmath66    on the basis of standard universality arguments one expects that the two o(3 ) actions give identical results in the continuum @xmath67 .",
    "this is indeed the case .",
    "the continuum limit of the dodecahedron model is also in agreement within the errors given .",
    "it agrees to 0.1% with the o(3 ) results .",
    "at this precision we are able to see , for the first time , cut - off effects in the fp action results .",
    "a part of them might come from the unimproved operators as well . at @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) the cut - off effect",
    "is 0.004 , a 0.1% effect . at this correlation length the cut - off effect of the standard action is @xmath70 times larger .",

    "\\1 ) the quantities @xmath23 and @xmath21 are given directly by measuring sums over the entire lattice without any need to extract the exponential fall - off of some correlation functions , hence without an extra systematic error due to the fitting procedure .",
    "\\2 ) in the o(3 ) nn case we use `` fully improved '' estimators .",
    "we build all clusters corresponding to all 3 components ( i.e. 3 cluster configurations ) and apply the improved estimator to all terms in @xmath71 .",
    "this is allowed since for the standard o(3 ) action the 3 cluster distributions can be updated independently . at @xmath72",
    "the use of improved estimator decreases the error by a factor @xmath73 .",
    "unfortunately , there is no fully improved estimator for the fp action ( the action is not a sum of 3 terms each depending on one component only ) and for the dodecahedron ( no @xmath74 rotation symmetry ) .",
    "one still could apply the improved estimator to a single component ",
    "say @xmath75  and restore the full quantity @xmath76 using the symmetry .",
    "however , this introduces an extra noise and for the present case ( small @xmath41 ) it turns out to be worse than the standard estimator .",
    "hence we used the improved estimator for these cases only to check the self - consistency of the result ( in particular , to test the random number generator ) .",
    "\\3 ) as seen from eq .",
    "( [ gr ] ) , for large @xmath34 there must be strong cancellation between the terms in the second factor ( the binder cumulant ) .",
    "therefore the signal / noise ratio is much better for @xmath77 than , say , for @xmath78 .",
    "\\4 ) for small @xmath41 the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath41 are strongly correlated with each other . the quantity @xmath79 with appropriate @xmath80 turns out to have much smaller fluctuations .",
    "choosing @xmath54 for @xmath51 the quantity @xmath52 defined in this way has an error @xmath55 times smaller than the error of @xmath21 measured directly !    this way we could reach for @xmath52 in the nn o(3 ) model a relative error smaller than @xmath81 , perhaps unprecedented in mc simulations of the non - linear @xmath13-model .",
    "as opposed to the @xmath3 spin models discussed before , gauge models on discrete non - abelian subgroups of su(2 ) , or su(3 ) have typically a first order phase transition between the strong coupling and frozen phases .",
    "the standard plaquette action , for example , with the largest 120-element subgroup @xmath82 of su(2 ) ( @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the symmetry group of dodecahedron ) has a first order phase transition at @xmath85  @xcite . for the su(2 )",
    "plaquette action approximate scaling starts already around @xmath86 and at this coupling even the bare quantities of the su(2 ) and the @xmath82 actions are very close to each other .",
    "one expects , therefore that very large correlation lengths are reached with the @xmath82 action before the freezing transition occurs . for any practical considerations this is the same situation as a second order phase transition .",
    "in addition , the correlation length at the phase transition point can be influenced by changing the form of the action and we are not aware of any arguments which would exclude the existence of a local action with a second order transition . for the 1080-element subgroup of su(3 ) with the plaquette action the first order transition occurs at small correlation length much before the scaling region@xcite .",
    "the transition is related to the large gap @xmath87 between the trace of the unit element and that of its nearest neighbor in group space .",
    "( note that the corresponding gap is @xmath88 for the @xmath82 subgroup of su(2 ) ) .",
    "if , by increasing @xmath89 , the plaquette expectation value is forced to take significantly larger values than @xmath90 , a first order transition occurs after which most of the plaquette traces are at 3 and the system becomes frozen .",
    "this picture suggests to introduce additional loops into the action , distribute the action value between them and so keeping the plaquette value lower . without systematic search we found several actions which allow to go into the scaling region .    as an example , a recent parameterization of the su(3 )",
    "fp action@xcite , when used over the 1080-element subgroup , remains in the strong coupling phase down to an estimated @xmath91fm .",
    "this resolution corresponds to @xmath92 for the standard plaquette action .",
    "no serious numerical studies were performed yet in su(3 ) yang - mills theory at such small lattice distances .",
    "we performed different tests on the 120-element @xmath82 subgroup using the plaquette action .",
    "no deviations from the su(2 ) group predictions were found .",
    "we have to remark , however that the precision of these calculations is far below of that in the spin models presented before .    -6 mm    we made a standard two - lattice monte carlo renormalization group mcrg analysis in the coupling constant region @xmath93 , while that of the su(2 ) plaquette action by @xmath94 . ] in order to test whether the underlying theory has a single relevant parameter ( as a yang - mills theory has ) and to get quantitative results on the scales , i.e. on @xmath95 , where @xmath27 is the lattice unit .",
    "configurations were generated on @xmath96 and @xmath97 lattices which were blocked to @xmath98 lattices using 4 and 3 rg steps , respectively .",
    "a simple swendsen - type blocking @xcite was used and the block average was projected back to the discrete subgroup after every block step . on",
    "the @xmath98 blocked configurations the plaquette and the length-6 twisted loop were measured .",
    "they correspond to large smeared loops on the original lattices . generating the @xmath96 configurations at some @xmath89 ,",
    "one is searching for an associated @xmath99 where the @xmath97 configurations after 3 blocking steps give the same loop expectation values as the @xmath96 configurations after 4 steps .",
    "the corresponding @xmath100 ( as the function of @xmath101 ) gives the shift in the coupling which results in a factor of 2 increase in the lattice unit @xmath27 : @xmath102 . in order to see the sensitivity on the number of blocking steps , the procedure was repeated on @xmath97 versus @xmath103 lattices using 3 and 2 block steps , respectively .",
    "-6 mm    fig  [ fig : plaq ] gives the plaquette expectation values and the figure caption explains how to get the @xmath104 shifts .",
    "the figure for the twisted loop expectation values looks similar .",
    "the @xmath104 shifts from the plaquette and from the twisted loop are consistent indicating that there is one relevant coupling only in this problem .",
    "the @xmath104 values from this analysis ( which are not far from the two - loop perturbation theory prediction for su(2 ) ) suggest that very small lattice units can be obtained in this formulation before approaching the freezing transition at @xmath105 . on the basis of this rg analysis",
    "we estimate that @xmath106 .",
    "we are not able to give a reliable error estimate here due to the uncontrolled extrapolation errors in the number of blocking steps .",
    "we measured the short distance part of the potential at @xmath107 and 3.20 on @xmath108 and @xmath96 lattices , respectively , and compared the results with those obtained in su(2 ) at @xmath109 and 2.96 by bali et al .",
    "after matching the scales and the non - physical constant in the potential the subgroup results are consistent with the su(2 ) curve .",
    "this is illustrated by figs .",
    "[ fig : pot271 ] and [ fig : pot320 ] for @xmath110 and 3.20 , respectively .",
    "the quality of the matching is similar at @xmath111 .",

    "[ fig : pot320 ] the 3 curves with @xmath114 illustrate the sensitivity of the matching on @xmath115 .",
    "we did not attempt to give errors here since we did not check the finite volume effects and cut - off effects in the short distance part of the potential .",
    "in addition , the sensitivity of the matching on the scaling relations is rather weak . from the scale relations above and @xmath116 @xcite one obtains @xmath117 , while the rg analysis gave @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , one obtains @xmath119 and @xmath120 from potential matching and rg analysis , respectively .",
    "we want to return to the question of cut - off effects in af theories .",
    "although there are no rigorous considerations beyond perturbation theory , it is a generally used standard assumption that close to the continuum limit @xmath65 powers with logarithms describe the cut - off effects in bosonic theories . extrapolations of numerical data are done accordingly . the systematic symanzik improvement program@xcite applied in a non - perturbative environment is based on this assumption .",
    "we are perplexed by the results in figure  [ fig : gra ] and by the numbers in the @xmath121 fit .",
    "actually , it has been observed earlier@xcite that at @xmath122 a linear fit for @xmath21 in @xmath59 was preferred .",
    "however , due to larger errors choosing this form was not compelling . the leading order large @xmath9 result on @xmath123 in infinite volume has the expected @xmath2 ( with logarithms ) behavior@xcite",
    ". it would be interesting to see what happens beyond leading order and in a finite volume",
    ". it would be important to check whether other observables , or on - shell quantities like the spectrum show a similar behavior .",
    "obviously , the same questions in d=4 gauge theories are even more relevant .",
