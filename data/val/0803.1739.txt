    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductors , the strongly correlated electron systems have been studied intensively . the effect of the strong correlation between electrons is important for many quantum critical phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity ( sc ) .",

    "the superconductivity of the hubbard model has been questioned for many years .",
    "it is extremely difficult to show the existence of superconducting phase for the hubbard model in a reasonable way . for the present we can not answer this long - standing question soon . instead of examining the possibility of superconductivity",
    ", it is possible to investigate possible symmetries of cooper pairs for an effective hamiltonian with the attractive interaction . for this purpose effective hamiltonians",
    "have been obtained for the hubbard model .",
    "the t - j model is the well known effective hamiltonian derived in the limit of the large on - site repulsion @xmath0 , using the canonical transformation @xmath9 with @xmath10 . on the other hand , in the limit of small @xmath0 , the perturbation theory also leads to an effective hamiltonian with the attractive interaction@xcite , where we have @xmath11 .",
    "the phase diagram with respect to the cooper pair symmetry can be determined if we solve the gap equation .",
    "we must notice that we should compare the energy with other electronic states to show that the superconducting state is indeed stable .",
    "for the half - filled band with vanishing @xmath12 in two space dimensions , the antiferromagnetic order parameter for small @xmath0 is@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "it is , however , obvious that the antiferromagnetically ordered state is unstable away from half filling if the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 is small .",
    "thus we focus on the case of small @xmath0 for which we have also a merit that the gap equation is considerably simplified .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to determine the gap symmetry for the square lattice using the small-@xmath0 gap equation derived for the effective hamiltonian .",
    "although the real superconductivity in correlated electron systems should be described by a theory of strong - coupling superconductivity , the phase diagram can be determined in detail using the weak coupling formulation .",
    "precise calculations are sometimes not easy at low temperatures in the strong - coupling formulation due to the matsubara frequency summation and the wave number summation .",
