    "the behavior of the spin resistivity @xmath0 as a function of temperature ( @xmath1 ) has been shown and theoretically explained by many authors during the last 50 years . among the ingredients which govern the properties of @xmath0 , we can mention the scattering of the itinerant spins by the lattice magnons suggested by kasuya@xcite , the diffusion due to impurities@xcite , and the spin - spin correlation.@xcite first - principles analysis of spin - disorder resistivity of fe and ni has been also recently performed.@xcite    experiments have been performed on many magnetic materials ranging from metals to semiconductors .",
    "these results show that the behavior of the spin resistivity depends on the material : some of them show a large peak of @xmath0 at the magnetic transition temperature @xmath2,@xcite others show only a change of slope of @xmath0 giving rise to a peak of the differential resistivity @xmath3.@xcite very recent experiments such as those performed on ferromagnetic srruo@xmath4 thin films@xcite , ru - doped induced ferromagnetic la@xmath5ca@xmath6mno@xmath4@xcite , antiferromagnetic @xmath7-(mn@xmath8fe@xmath9)@xmath10ge@xcite , semiconducting pr@xmath11ca@xmath12mno@xmath4 thin films@xcite , superconducting bafe@xmath13as@xmath13 single crystals@xcite , la@xmath8sr@xmath9mno@xmath4@xcite and mn@xmath8cr@xmath9te@xcite compounds show different forms of anomaly of the magnetic resistivity at the magnetic phase transition temperature .    the magnetic resistivity due to the scattering of itinerant spins by localized lattice spins is proportional to the spin - spin correlation as proposed long - time ago by de gennes and friedel@xcite , fisher and langer@xcite , and recently by kataoka@xcite .",
    "they have shown that changing the range of spin - spin correlation changes the shape of @xmath0 . in a recent work ,",
    "zarand et al.@xcite have showed that in magnetic diluted semiconductors the shape of the resistivity versus @xmath1 depends on the interaction between the itinerant spins and localized magnetic impurities which is characterized by a anderson localization length @xmath14 . expressing physical quantities in terms of @xmath14 around impurities , they calculated @xmath0 and showed that its peak height depends indeed on this localization length .    in our previous work@xcite",
    "we have studied the spin current in ferromagnetic thin films .",
    "the behavior of the spin resistivity as a function of @xmath1 has been shown and explained as an effect of magnetic domains formed in the proximity of the phase transition point .",
    "this new concept has an advantage over the use of the spin - spin correlation since the distribution of clusters is more easily calculated using monte carlo simulations .",
    "although the formation of spin clusters and their sizes are a consequence of spin - spin correlation , the direct access in numerical calculations to the structure of clusters allows us to study complicated systems such as thin films , systems with impurities , systems with high degree of instability etc . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation functions are very difficult to calculate . moreover , as will be shown in this paper , the correlation function can not be used to explain the behavior of the spin resistivity in antiferromagnets where very few theoretical investigations have been carried out .",
    "one of these is the work by suezaki and mori@xcite which simply predicted that the behavior of the spin resistivity in antiferromagnets is that in ferromagnets if the correlation is short - ranged .",
    "it means that correlation should be limited to `` selected nearest - neighbors '' .",
    "such an explanation is obviously not satisfactory in particular when the sign of the correlation function between antiparallel spin pairs are taken into account . in a work with a model suitable for magnetic semiconductors",
    ", haas has shown that the resistivity @xmath0 in antiferromagnets is quite different from that of ferromagnets.@xcite in particular , he found that while ferromagnets show a peak of @xmath0 at the magnetic transition of the lattice spins , antiferromagnets do not have such a peak .",
    "we will demonstrate that all these effects can be interpreted in terms of clusters used in our model .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a simple model which takes into account the interaction between itinerant spins and localized lattice spins .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath15 model@xcite .",
    "the lattice spins interact with each other via antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the model will be studied here by a combination of monte carlo simulation and the boltzmann s equation . as will be discussed below",
    ", such a model corresponds to antiferromagnetic semiconductors such as mnte .",
    "an application is made for this compound in the present work .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ theo ] ,",
    "we show and discuss our general model and its application to the antiferromagnetic case using the boltzmann s equation formulated in terms of clusters .",
    "we also describe here our monte carlo simulations to obtain the distributions of sizes and number of clusters as functions of @xmath1 which will be used to solve the boltzmann s equation .",
    "results on the effects of ising - like anisotropy and magnetic field as well as an application to the case of mnte is shown in section iii .",
    "concluding remarks are given in section iv .",
    "let us recall briefly principal theoretical models for magnetic resistivity @xmath0",
    ". in magnetic systems , de gennes and friedel@xcite have suggested that the magnetic resistivity is proportional to the spin - spin correlation . as a consequence , in ferromagnetically ordered systems , @xmath0 shows a divergence at the transition temperature @xmath2 , similar to the susceptibility .",
    "however , in order to explain the finite cusp of @xmath0 experimentally observed in some experiments , fisher and langer@xcite suggested to take into account only short - range correlations in the de gennes - friedel s theory . kataoka@xcite has followed the same line in proposing a model where he included , in addition to a parameter describing the correlation range , some other parameters describing effects of the magnetic instability , the density of itinerant spins and the applied magnetic field .    for antiferromagnetic systems ,",
    "suezaki and mori@xcite proposed a model to explain the anomalous behavior of the resistivity around the nel temperature .",
    "they used the kubo s formula for an @xmath15 hamiltonian with some approximations to connect the resistivity to the correlation function .",
    "however , it is not so easy to resolve the problem . therefore , the form of the correlation function was just given in the molecular field approximation .",
    "they argued that just below the nel temperature @xmath16 a long - range correlation appears giving rise to an additional magnetic potential which causes a gap .",
    "this gap affects the electron density which alters the spin resistivity but does not in their approximation interfere in the scattering mechanism .",
    "they concluded that , under some considerations , the resistivity should have a peak close to the nel point .",
    "this behavior is observed in @xmath17 , @xmath18 and some rare earth metals .",
    "note however that in the approximations used by haas@xcite , there is no peak predicted .",
    "so the question of the existence of a peak in antiferromagnets remains open .",
    "following haas , we use for semiconductors the following interaction @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the exchange interaction between an itinerant spin @xmath21 at @xmath22 and the lattice spin @xmath23 at the lattice site @xmath24 . in practice , the sum on lattice spins @xmath23 should be limited at some cut - off distance as will be discussed later .",
    "haas supposed that @xmath25 is weak enough to be considered as a perturbation to the lattice hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamil ] ) below .",
    "this is what we also suppose in the present paper .",
    "he applied his model to ferromagnetic doped cdcr@xmath13se@xmath26@xcite and antiferromagnetic semiconductors mnte .",
    "note however that the model by haas as well as other existing models can not treat the case where itinerant spins , due to the interaction between themselves , induce itinerant magnetic ordering such as in ( ga , mn)as shown by matsukura et al.@xcite note also that both the up - spin and down - spin currents are present in the theory but the authors considered only the effect of the up - spin current since the interaction `` itinerant spin''-``lattice spin '' is ferromagnetic so that the down - spin current is very small .",
    "this theory was built in the framework of the relaxation - time approximation of the boltzmann s equation under an electric field . as de gennes and friedel , haas used here the spin - spin correlation to describe the scattering of itinerant spins by the disorder of the lattice spins . as a result",
    ", the model of haas shows a peak in the ferromagnetic case but no peak in the antiferromagnetic semiconductors .",
    "experimentally , the absence of a peak has been observed in antiferromagnetic lafeaso by mcguire et al.@xcite and in cerhin@xmath27 by christianson et al.@xcite      in the case of ising spins in a ferromagnet that we studied before@xcite , we have made a theory based on the cluster structure of the lattice spins .",
    "the cluster distribution was incorporated in the boltzmann s equation .",
    "the number of clusters @xmath28 and their sizes @xmath29 have been numerically determined using the hoshen - kopelmann s algorithm ( section  [ hoshenkopelmann]).@xcite we work in diffusive regime with approximation of parabolic band and in an @xmath15 model .",
    "we consider in this paper that in our range of temperature the hall resistivity is constant ( constant density ) . to work with the born approximation we consider a weak potential of interaction between clusters of spin and conduction electrons .",
    "we suppose that the life s time of clusters is larger than the relaxation time . as in our previous paper@xcite",
    "we use in this paper the expression of relaxation time obtained from the boltzmann s equation in the following manner .",

    "from these rather rude considerations , we extract @xmath135 from @xmath133 and compare our theoretical with @xmath136 .",
    "this is what we called `` normalized resistivity '' in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnte ] .",
    "several remarks are in order :    \\i ) the peak temperature of our theoretical model is found at 310 k corresponding the the experimental nel temperature although for our fit we have used only the above - mentioned values of exchange integrals    \\ii ) our result is in agreement with experimental data obtained by chandra et al.@xcite for temperatures between 140 k and 280 k above which chandra et al . did not unfortunately measured    \\iii ) at temperatures lower than 140 k , the experimental curve increases with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "note that many experimental data on various materials show this universal feature : we can mention the data by li et al.@xcite , du et al.@xcite , zhang et al.@xcite , mcguire et al.@xcite among others .",
    "our theoretical model based on the scattering by defect clusters can not account for this behavior because there are no defects at very low @xmath1 .",
    "direct monte carlo simulation shows however that the freezing indeed occurs at low @xmath1 both in ferromagnets@xcite and antiferromagnets@xcite giving rise to an increase of the spin resistivity with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "there are several explanations for this experimental behavior among which we can mention the fact that in semiconductors the carrier concentration increases as @xmath1 increases , giving rise to an increase of the spin current , namely a decrease of the resistivity , with increasing @xmath1 in the low-@xmath1 region .",
    "another origin of the increase of @xmath0 as @xmath137 is the possibility that the itinerant electrons may be frozen ( crystallized ) due to their interactions with localized spins and between themselves , giving rise to low mobility . on the hypothesis of frozen electrons , there is a reference on the charge - ordering at low @xmath1 in pr@xmath138ca@xmath138mno@xmath4@xcite due to some strain interaction .",
    "a magnetic field can make this ordering melted giving rise to a depressed resistivity .",
    "our present model does not correspond to this compound but we believe that the concept is similar . for the system pr@xmath138ca@xmath138mno@xmath4 , which shows a commensurate charge order , the `` melting '' fields at low temperatures are high , on the order of 25 tesla@xcite .",
    "\\iv ) the existence of the peak at @xmath124 k of the theoretical spin resistivity shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mnte ] is in agreement with experimental data recently published by li et al.@xcite ( see the inset of their fig . 5 ) .",
    "unfortunately , we could not renormalize the resistivity values of li et al.@xcite to put in the same figure with our result for a quantitative comparison .",
    "other data on various materials@xcite also show a large peak at the magnetic transition temperature .    to close this section ,",
    "let us note that it is also possible , with some precaution , to apply our model on other families of antiferromagnetic semiconductors like cerhin@xmath27 and lafeaso .",
    "an example of supplementary difficulties but exciting subject encountered in the latter compound is that there are two transitions in a small temperature region : a magnetic transition at @xmath139 k and a tetragonal - orthorhombic crystallographic phase transition at @xmath140 k.@xcite an application to ferromagnetic semiconductors of the n - type cdcr@xmath13se@xmath26@xcite is under way .",
    "we have shown in this paper the behavior of the magnetic resistivity @xmath0 as a function of temperature in antiferromagnetic semiconductors . the main interaction which governs",
    "the resistivity behavior is the interaction between itinerant spins and the lattice spins .",
    "our analysis , based on the boltzmann s equation which uses the temperature - dependent cluster distribution obtained by mc simulation .",
    "our result is in agreement with the theory by haas@xcite : we observe a broad maximum of @xmath0 in the temperature region of the magnetic transition without a sharp peak observed in ferromagnetic materials .",
    "we have studied the two cases , degenerate and non - degenerate semiconductors .",
    "the non - degenerate case shows a maximum which is more pronounced than that of the degenerate case .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the shape of the maximum and its existence depend on several physical parameters such as interactions between different kinds of spins , the spin model , the crystal structure etc . in this paper",
    "we applied our theoretical model in the antiferromagnetic semiconductor mnte .",
    "we found a good agreement with experimental data near the transition region .",
    "we note however that our model using the cluster distribution can not be applied at very low @xmath1 where the spin resistivity in experiments is dominated by effects other than @xmath15 scattering model of the present paper .",
    "one of these possible effects is the carrier proliferation with increasing temperatures in semiconductors which makes the resistivity decrease with increasing @xmath1 experimentally observed in magnetic semiconductors at low @xmath1 .",
    "one of us ( ka ) wishes to thank the jsps for a financial support of his stay at okayama university where this work was carried out .",
    "he is also grateful to the researchers of prof .",
