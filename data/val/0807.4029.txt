    "in a seminal paper published a long time ago , blonder , tinkham , and klapwijk @xcite ( btk ) calculated the conductance of a normal ( n)superconducting ( s ) interface as a function of the interface transparency .",
    "in particular they showed that at zero temperature ( @xmath0 ) and for electrons at the fermi energy that conductance is given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the  normal \" reflection coefficient of the interface , while @xmath3 is the reflection coefficient for the andreev processes , @xcite which reflect electron - like excitations as hole - like ones .",
    "for simplicity , both the normal and the superconductor regions were taken to be free of any impurity scattering ( except at the interface ) .",
    "then , when the interface is perfectly transparent , i.e. , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the value of @xmath6 is twice that of the",
    " normal \" quantum limit of the conductance .",
    "however , when a large enough barrier exists at the interface between the superconducting and the normal regions , @xmath6 becomes much smaller than the conductance obtained when the superconductor is made normal .",
    "this is the simplest example where superconductivity in a part of a system _ reduces _ its overall conductance .",
    "( the more complicated many - channel , disordered case is not addressed in this paper . ) in this paper we consider the more subtle nsn combination , and demonstrate a similar effect : with a large enough barrier at even one of the ns interfaces , the appearance of superconductivity in the s region reduces the overall conductance .",
    "some of the motivation for the present work comes from our wish to understand why the mixed ns bulk composite structure is often insulating at @xmath7 and the superconducting phase of a thin film goes over ( with increasing disorder or decreasing film thickness ) directly into the insulating rather than to the normal - conducting phase @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that often the activation energy for the conductance of the insulating phase is given by the superconductor gap of the superconducting component @xcite .",
    "thus , the superconducting component plays the role of an additional barrier between the normal segments !",
    "the charge - vortex duality @xcite for a system of charged bosons of course explains the insulating phase as dual to the superconducting one .",
    "vortex localization yields zero resistance and charge localization yields zero conductance at @xmath0 . our purpose is to provide a heuristic understanding of how the charge localization is established .",
    "reducing the small - scale conductance of the system pushes it towards the insulating state .",
    "the nsn system is the simplest microscopic element of the ns network .",
    "we find that it already presents nontrivial theoretical questions having to do with a seeming deficiency of the bogoliubov - degennes ( bdg ) formulation .",
    "blonder _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite employed the bdg equation for the quasiparticle excitations in the superconducting region , assuming that the energy gap @xmath8 which vanishes in the normal part does not vary spatially in the superconductor . since in most situations",
    "the superconducting coherence length @xmath9 is much larger than the fermi wavelength and much smaller than the length of the s - region , this assumption seems quite harmless .",
    "consequently , it is widely accepted that the use of the bdg equation , without attempting to compute the ( complex , in general ) superconducting order - parameter self - consistently , is valid for many hybrid structures .    a particularly important issue emphasized by btk concerns the conversion of the normal current into a super - current at the ns interface , ensuring charge - current conservation over the entire structure ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "@xcite showed that the normal charge - current ( which is distinct from the quasiparticle current ) entering the superconductor decays , but concomitantly a super - current grows up gradually , until very far inside s the normal current disappears completely , and the entire charge is carried away by cooper pairs .",
    "one might wonder what happens to this scenario when the superconductor has a finite width and is not infinite as in the btk case .",
    "it turns out that within the bdg formulation the super - current in the s region does not properly convert back to normal current in the second n region .",
    "we are not aware of a way to correct for this deficiency ( leaving aside the possibility mentioned above to compute the order - parameter self - consistently ) . in this paper",
    "we will circumvent this problem by using a particular geometry .",
    "not surprisingly , transport through hybrid ns structures has been addressed before , even prior @xcite to the publication of the paper by btk . indeed , as eq .",
    "( [ btkfo ] ) bears a strong resemblance to the landauer formula @xcite for coherent transport , several modern treatments ( representative examples are to be found in refs .  ) employ scattering theory within the landauer picture in an attempt to extend the btk result ( [ btkfo ] ) to more than a single ns interface .",
    "the scattering formalism is also used to study the current fluctuations in mesoscopic systems with andreev reflections .",
    "@xcite however , there is a vicious caveat in this approach : the bdg equation , while conserving the number of quasiparticles , does not conserve charge .",
    "the bdg formulation follows , in this respect , the similar deficiency of the bcs approach upon which the bdg equation is based .",
    "this does not cause any harm when the formulation is used for a bulk superconductor , as had been done by btk ( see also ref .  ) , or when the system has the shape of a closed ring , where the boundary conditions enforce current conservation .",
    "@xcite however , when the size of the superconducting segment is finite , the non - conservation of the charge leads to current _ vs. _ chemical - potential - difference relations ( within the linear response regime ) that depend on the chemical potential of the superconductor , as opposed to the situation in the normal phase .",
    "@xcite indeed , the conductances of various hybrid structures have been determined within scattering theory ( when the superconducting is  floating \" ) by fixing the chemical potential on s such that current is conserved .",
    "@xcite one would have assumed navely that this procedure cures the problem mentioned above .",
    "it turns out , however , that it does not : as discussed by anantram and datta @xcite ( see also ref .  ) , applying the very same procedure to the calculation of the current fluctuations ( the power spectrum of the noise ) violates the johnson - nyquist relationships .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ disca ] that this ` floating - potential ' approach also does not produce the doubling of the conductance [ see eq .",
    "( [ btkfo ] ) above ] when the ns interface becomes transparent .",
    "it approaches , however , the conductance found by the kubo formula in the limit where the barrier is strong and its transparency is low .",
    "it follows that in order to use the bdg equation for the calculation of the conductance of a mesoscopic system containing a finite - length superconducting segment , one needs charge - conserving solutions of that equation .",
    "such solutions arise naturally when the nsn structure ( the left panel in fig .",

    "[ sys ] ) , and dealing with the nontrivial problem arising from the above - mentioned deficiency of the bdg picture , we find that the nsn conductance can indeed _ decrease _ when , for example , the superconducting component becomes longer .",
    "we are not able to treat here the behavior of the two - dimensional or the three - dimensional nsn arrays .",
    "suffice it to say that when the  small scale \" resistance of the elementary building block increases , the tendency for localization at larger scales becomes stronger .",
    "the subtleties involved in producing a consistent landauer - type formula for the conductance of an nsn structure within the bdg formulation are best explained by considering the simplest single - mode , two - terminal configuration at zero temperature . in other words , we assume that there is no scattering in the system except for the potential barriers at the interfaces , such that the transverse channel modes are not mixed ( and their indices can be omitted ) .    we start with the purely normal case , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ sys ] , except that the s section is replaced by a normal one ( for example , by letting its gap approach zero ) . in this case",
    "there is no need to treat electrons and holes concomitantly , as there are no andreev processes .",

    "moreover , for the result for the conductance [ eq .",
    "( [ isof ] ) ] to be fully satisfactory , it should agree with the linear response , kubo , formula for the related large ring geometry .",

    "this always holds for a normal system , in which these two types of quasiparticles are not mixed .",
    "however , in a superconductor the andreev processes mix the hole - like with the electron - like excitations , thus violating the conditions ( [ be ] ) for general hybrid structures with a finite - size s segment . an exception is the ring geometry .",

    "for example , to an assembly of thermal phonons .",

    "( [ isof ] ) seems to be _",

    "( [ isof ] ) actually tends to @xmath194 and _ never _ yields the doubling of @xmath195 due to the andreev reflections .",

    "( [ kuba ] ) ( solid lines ) , as a function of @xmath157 for four values of the interface transmission .",
    "the latter conductance is always larger than the former.,width=302 ]    the difference between the two approaches becomes most marked in the limit of a nearly transparent barrier and a thick superconductor .",
    "this can be easily understood by noting that the addition of the two ns resistances is handled very differently by the two approaches . for the fully quantum case ,",
    "adding two ideal conductances ( @xmath196 for the ns case ) gives just one ideal conductance .",
    "on the other , the scattering formalism , in the limit @xmath192 and @xmath193 gives that both @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath197 ) vanish , and so does @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , while @xmath26 ( @xmath198 ) tends to unity [ see eqs .",

    "( [ isof ] ) becomes exactly the classical addition of resistances , producing half the ideal quantum conductance of the pure ns junction .",
    "this is due to the fixing of the chemical potential on the s - section to conserve the current , as in the classical treatment .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the presence of a superconducting segment in an otherwise normal system reduces the overall conductance once the barriers between the superconducting and the normal parts become high enough .",
    "thus , the superconducting segments may push the system towards the localizes insulating state .    from the appearance of the plots presented in figs .",
