    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the firmest candidates for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of particle interactions .",
    "if new particles are discovered at the lhc , the forthcoming step will be to establish their nature .",
    "this step could be performed at a high energy @xmath1 linear collider .",
    "one of the basic predictions of susy is the equality of the couplings in the different sectors : the sm gauge couplings must be equal to the superpartners gauge couplings and to the yukawa coupling between a particle and its superpartner .",
    "we present a full one - loop computation of the electroweak ( ew ) corrections to the sfermion partial decay width @xmath2 @xmath3 being a sfermion , @xmath4 a sm fermion and @xmath5 a chargino ( @xmath6 ) or a neutralino ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the process  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) probes the fermion - sfermion - gaugino / higgsino coupling , and can be used to test the susy relations .",
    "as we will see , the radiative corrections induce finite shifts in these relations which are non - decoupling .",
    "the qcd corrections to the process  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) , in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , were computed in  @xcite . however , the electroweak effects are much more cumbersome as their computation requires the renormalization of the whole mssm lagrangian . a first estimate was given in  @xcite , where the contribution from the yukawa couplings of bottom quarks decaying into chargino - neutralinos was analyzed within the so - called higgsino approximation .",
    "the electroweak effects have been further elaborated in  @xcite .",
    "the computation to one - loop level of the partial decay width  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) requires the renormalization of the full mssm lagrangian , taking into account the relations among the different sectors and the mixing parameters .",
    "we choose to work in an on - shell renormalization scheme , in which the renormalized parameters are the measured quantities .",
    "the sm sector is renormalized according to the standard on - shell sm @xmath8-scheme  @xcite , and the mssm higgs sector ( in particular the renormalization of @xmath9 ) is treated as in  @xcite .",
    "as far as the sfermion sector is concerned , each squark doublet contains 5 independent parameters .",
    "we choose to use the following set of input parameters : @xmath10 the remaining parameters are computed as a function of those in  ( [ eq : inputsf ] ) . in particular , the trilinear soft - susy - breaking couplings read : @xmath11 with @xmath12 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs boson doublets .",
    "the mass parameters in  ( [ eq : inputsf ] ) are defined to be on - shell . for the mixing angle counterterm",
    "we adopt the following convention : @xmath13 being @xmath14 the mixing self - energy between sfermions @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the convention  ( [ eq : deltatheta ] ) is known to introduce gauge parameter dependence in the definition of the mixing angle , but the result is the same as the gauge independent computation of the self - energies in  ( [ eq : deltatheta ] ) within the t hooft - feynman gauge  @xcite . since the heaviest top - squark mass is not an input parameter , it receives finite radiative corrections : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a combination of the counterterms of the parameters in  ( [ eq : inputsf ] ) , and the counterterms of the gauge and higgs sectors .",
    "the complete one - loop computation consists of : + @xmath52 renormalization constants for the parameters and wave functions in the bare lagrangian , + @xmath52 one - loop one - particle irreducible three - point functions , + @xmath52 mixing terms among the external charginos and neutralinos , + @xmath52 soft- and hard- photon bremsstrahlung .",
    "+ all kind of mssm particles are taken into account in the loops : sm fermions , sfermions , electroweak gauge bosons , higgs bosons , goldstone bosons , fadeev - popov ghosts , charginos , neutralinos .",
    "the computation is performed in the t hooft - feynman gauge , using dimensional reduction for the regularization of divergent integrals .",
    "the loop computation itself is done using the computer algebra packages _ feynarts 3.0 _ and _ formcalc 2.2 _",
    "the numerical evaluation of one - loop integrals makes use of _ looptools 1.2 _  @xcite .",
    "the results show the very interesting property that none of the particles of the mssm decouples from the corrections to the observables  ( [ eq : gammadef ] ) .",
    "this can be well understood in terms of renormalization group ( rg ) running of the parameters and susy breaking .",
    "take , e.g. , the effects of squarks in the electron - selectron - photino coupling . above the squark mass scale ( @xmath53 )",
    "the electron electromagnetic coupling ( @xmath54 ) is equal ( by susy ) to the electron - selectron - photino coupling ( @xmath55 ) , and both couplings run according to the same rg equations . at @xmath56 the squarks",
    "_ decouple _ from the rg running of the couplings . at @xmath57",
    ", @xmath54 runs due to the contributions from pure quark loops , but @xmath55 does not run anymore , and it is _ frozen _ at the squark scale , that is : @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , when comparing these two couplings at a scale @xmath57 , they differ by the logarithmic running of @xmath54 from the squark scale to @xmath59 : @xmath60 .",
    "the above discussion has two important consequences : + * 1 ) * the non - decoupling can be used to extract information of the high - energy part of the susy spectrum : one can envisage a susy model in which a significant splitting among the different susy masses exists , e.g. @xmath61 , where the sleptons lie below the production threshold in an @xmath1 linear collider , but the squarks are above it . by means of high precision measurements of the lepton - slepton - chargino / neutralino couplings one might be able to extract information of the squark sector of the model , to be checked with the available data from the lhc . + * 2 ) * by the same token , it means that the value of the radiative corrections depends on all parameters of the model , and we can not make precise quantitative statements unless the full susy spectrum is known .",
    "this drawback can be partially overcome by the introduction of _ effective coupling matrices _ , which can be defined as follows .",
    "the subset of fermion - sfermion one - loop contributions to the self - energies of gauge - boson , higgs - bosons , goldstone - bosons , charginos and neutralinos form a gauge invariant finite subset of the corrections .",
    "therefore these contributions can be absorbed into a finite shift of the chargino / neutralino mixing matrices @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 appearing in the couplings : @xmath62 . in this way we can _ decouple _ the computation of the _ universal _ ( or _ super - oblique _",
    "@xcite ) corrections .",
    "these corrections contain the non - decoupling logarithms from sfermion masses .",
    "we have been able to derive an analytic expression containing these logarithms in a simple case .",
    "we have computed the electron - selectron contributions to @xmath63 and @xmath64 matrices , assuming zero mixing angle in the selectron sector ( @xmath65 ) , we have identified the leading terms in the approximation @xmath66 , and analytically cancelled the divergences and the renormalization scale dependent terms ; finally , we have kept only the terms logarithmic in the slepton masses .",
    "the result for @xmath63 reads as follows : @xmath67\\,\\ , ,   \\end{array }   \\nonumber\\\\ \\begin{array}{l } \\delta{u_{i2}}^{(f)}={\\frac{\\alpha}{4\\,\\pi\\,{s_w^2}}}\\log\\left(\\frac{m^2_{\\tilde e_l}}{{\\ensuremath{m^2_x}}}\\right)\\ , { u_{i1}}\\times \\\\ ~~~\\times \\,\\frac{{\\ensuremath{m_w}}\\,(m\\,{c_\\beta}+ \\mu\\,{s_\\beta } ) }   { 3\\,\\sqrt{2}\\,(m^2-\\mu^2)\\,{\\left(m_1 ^ 2-m_2 ^ 2\\right)}^2 }    \\left((m^2-\\mu^2)^2   + \\right . \\\\\\left .   ~~~+4\\,m^2\\,{\\ensuremath{m^2_w}}+",

    "in the on - shell scheme for the sm electroweak theory we define parameters at very different scales , basically @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "these wide - ranging scales enter the structure of the counterterms and so must appear in eq.([eq : logterms ] ) too . as a result",
    "the leading log in the various terms of this equation will vary accordingly .",
    "for simplicity in the notation we have factorized @xmath73 as an overall factor . in some cases",
    "this factor can be very big , @xmath74 ; it comes from the electron - selectron contribution to the chargino - neutralino self - energies .",
    "although above we have singled out the non - decoupling properties of sfermions , we would like to stress that the whole spectrum shows non - decoupling properties . by numerical analysis",
    "we have been able to show the existence of logarithms of the gaugino mass parameters ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) , and the higgs mass ( @xmath77 ) . however , due to the complicated mixing structure of the model , we were not able to derive simple analytic expressions containing these non - decoupling logarithms",
    ". note that in _ any _ observable which includes the fermion - sfermion - chargino / neutralino yukawa couplings at leading order we will have this kind of corrections , therefore the full mssm spectrum must be taken into account when computing radiative corrections , since otherwise one could be missing large logarithmic contributions of the heavy masses .",

    "* b ) * the corrections show multiple threshold singularities when varying any of the parameters of the model , however they are well behaved in the regions between thresholds .",
    "therefore , in order to give a quantitative value of the corrections the correlation between the different particle masses must be known . + * c ) * the third sfermion family contains a large contribution that can be traced back to the presence of corrections similar to the _ threshold - like _ corrections to the bottom - quark ( and @xmath82-lepton ) yukawa coupling @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "this contribution contains ( aside from @xmath83 ) terms from the sfermion mixing self - energies @xmath84 , and is ( approximately ) proportional to the sfermion mass splitting .",
    "it is also present in the qcd corrections .",
    "+ * d ) * the three - point vertex functions contain the soft susy - breaking trilinear higgs - sfermion - sfermion couplings @xmath85 .",
    "if @xmath85 is large , it would induce large corrections ( even larger than @xmath86 ! ) .",
    "however , as long as @xmath85 is in the perturbative coupling regime , the corrections stay below @xmath87 . + points c ) and d ) play a complementary role in the large @xmath9 regime due to the relation  ( [ eq : abt ] ) . a small mass splitting ( or small mixing angle )",
    "means small @xmath83 corrections , but a large value of @xmath88 .",
    "however a large @xmath85 value would both spoil perturbativity and generate charge and/or colour breaking vacua .",
    "therefore , at large @xmath9 the bottom - squarks and @xmath82-sleptons must have significant splitting and mixing angle , providing large corrections of the type c ) above .",
    "the @xmath83 corrections play also an important role in the phenomenology of the mssm higgs bosons at large @xmath9 , showing non - decoupling properties for @xmath89 , as stressed e.g. in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath90 coupling , on the other hand , exhibits a new kind of non - decoupling properties , which are independent of the value of @xmath9 .    as an example of the numerical value of the corrections , we present in table  [ tab : corr ] the tree - level and corrected branching ratios for bottom - squarks , for the following set of input parameters : @xmath91 the results of table  [ tab : corr ]",
    "show that a high precision measurement of the partial decay branching ratios of sfermions , to be performed at a high energy @xmath92 linear collider , is sensitive to the ew corrections . from table",
    "[ tab : corr ] it is also clear that the ew corrections can induce a change on the branching ratios of the leading decay channels comparable to the qcd corrections .",
    "therefore both contributions must be taken into account on equal footing in the analysis of the phenomenology of sfermions .",
