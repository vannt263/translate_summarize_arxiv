    "abundance measurements of lithium in stellar atmospheres have long been an active pursuit for observers and theoreticians alike .",
    "much of the activity is directed at understanding the depletion of the atmospheric lithium from its abundance , often an inferred quantity , acquired at birth .",
    "open clusters serve as astrophysical laboratories in which to investigate the internal depletion of lithium because a given cluster provides a close approximation to a sample of coeval stars of a common age and initial composition including that of lithium but spanning a range of masses and other properties such as rotation . and",
    ", crucially , the suite of clusters spans a large range of ages for a small range in composition .",
    "three principal episodes of lithium depletion are recognized : ( i ) depletion through destruction of lithium at the base of the convective envelope of the pre - main sequence star , ( ii ) continued depletion by destruction in the main sequence phase , and ( iii ) depletion by a combination of diffusion and destruction in f - type main sequence stars in the narrow effective temperature range of about 64006900 k ( the so - called li - dip ) .",
    "sestito & randich ( 2005 ) assemble li abundance data for 20 open clusters with ages from 5 myr to 8 gyr to confront theories for li depletion with observations .",
    "the cluster @xmath0 per was among the sample of 20 clusters with li observations drawn from balachandran , lambert , & stauffer ( 1988 , 1996 ",
    "hereafter bls ) and randich et al . (",
    "1998 ) . in this paper , we obtain and analyze high - resolution spectra from which li abundances are obtained for about 50 stars .",
    "when the bls and this new sample are combined in a uniform manner and a reconsideration made of the cluster membership of the stars , li abundances are provided for 70 cluster members .",
    "observations of li in @xmath0 per were made initially by boesgaard et al .",
    "( 1988 ) who analyzed high - resolution spectra of six f - type stars to show that the li - dip ( boesgaard & tripicco 1986 ) has not yet developed in this young ( age of about 50 myr ) cluster .",
    "our principal goal was not to define the run of li abundance along the main sequence because that is already well known for f , g , and k - type stars ( boesgaard et al .",
    "1988 ; bls ; randich et al .",
    "1998 ) and m - type stars ( garca lpez et al . 1994 ; zapatero osorio et al . 1996 ) .",
    "rather we sought to determine if the li abundance at a given effective temperature has an intrinsic scatter .",
    "such a star - to - star variation in apparent li abundances has been reported for the pleiades , a cluster only slightly older than @xmath0 per ( butler et al .",
    "1987 ; soderblom et al .",
    "1993 ; king et al .",
    "this variation appears for stars with effective temperatures less than about 5300 k and extends to the useful limit of the sample at about 4000 k. the peak - to - peak variation is about 1.5 dex in apparent li abundance .",
    "stars with the stronger lii 6707 feature at a given temperature have higher projected rotational velocities ( _ v _ sin _ i _ ) .",
    "the debate is ongoing as to whether the variation in lii line strength in the pleiades and other clusters reflects a real abundance difference or differences in atmospheric structure not modelled by classical atmospheres .",
    "randich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) studied li abundances in 18 very active , x - ray selected members of @xmath0 per enlarging the original sample of bls in the 5500 @xmath1 3900 k range of effective temperature .",
    "randich et al .",
    "( 1988 ) suggested that , at t@xmath2 @xmath3 5300k , there was indeed a significant dispersion in li abundances in stars at the same temperature .",
    "they further suggested that rapid rotators had more li and exhibited a smaller dispersion than slow rotators at the same t@xmath2 .",
    "they inferred from these observations a likely relationship between li , chromospheric activity and the rotational history of stars .",

    "we reexamine the question of star - to - star variation in lithium abundance .    in section 2 ,",
    "we discuss selection of the newly observed stars . in section 3",
    ", we describe the new high - resolution spectra of @xmath0 per stars .",
    "section 4 presents the stellar parameters with emphasis on the effective temperature .",
    "the abundance analysis is introduced in section 5 .",
    "the run of li abundance with effective temperature and the star - to - star variations are discussed in section 6 .",
    "the paper concludes with general remarks in section 7 .",
    "in referring to members of the cluster , we follow the convention of ` webda ' , a website devoted to stellar clusters .",
    "heckmann et al .",
    "( 1956 ) and heckmann & lbeck ( 1958 ) introduced a numbering scheme preceded by the letters ` he ' .",
    "later , stauffer et al . ( 1985 , 1989a ) and prosser ( 1992 ) identified fainter stars with the letters ` ap ' . in webda ,",
    "the label he is replaced by # , thus he 12 becomes # 12 . in the case of the ap stars ,",
    "the numbering is increased by 1500 and ap replaced by # , thus ap 79 becomes # 1579 .    when the observations ( see below ) made for this paper are combined with those reported by balachandran et al .",
    "( 1988 , 1996 ) , we have spectra for 86 stars . since our primary goal is to determine whether the run of li abundance down the main sequence of the cluster exhibits scatter at a given effective temperature , it is vital to sort cleanly the cluster members from the non - members and also to separate out suitable from unsuitable ( i.e. , doubled - lined spectroscopic binaries ) members .    as long recognized , clean separation of members from non - members is not an easy task for @xmath0 per because it is at low galactic latitude and has a small relative proper motion . in making the separation ,",
    "we have called upon a variety of publications that have previously attempted the task . the primary source and",
    "the one used in selecting stars for observation was the seminal study of the cluster by prosser ( 1992 ) .",
    "he considered a variety of membership indicators among which the primary ones were proper motions and radial velocities of the stars .",
    "makarov ( 2006 ) reanalysed the cluster s proper motions using astrometry and photometry from the tycho-2 catalogue and the second usno ccd astrometric catalog ( ucac2 ) .",
    "makarov s table of ` high - fidelity ' members lists 139 stars with a v magnitude brighter than about 11.5 ; no table of non - members is provided . of the stars in our sample with v@xmath4 11.5 and designated as members according to prosser ,",
    "all but ten are among makarov s high - fidelity members .",
    "four of the ten stars not listed as members by makarov are categorized as non - members by mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( see below ) .",
    "it is unclear whether makarov studied all stars from prosser s list with v @xmath4 11.5 , and therefore the absence of a star in makarov s table is not necessarily an indication that it is not a member .",
    "we have included the remaining six stars in our sample in table 1 .",
    "mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) undertook a radial velocity program to check for spectroscopic binaries in the cluster .",
    "their criteria for membership were threefold : proper motions ( from ucac2 ) , radial velocity and location in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "these criteria were applied independently of prosser s and makarov s efforts at membership determination .",
    "fifty four of our 86 stars were in mermilliod et al.s program .",
    "of these only four were identified as non - members in that program : # 143 , 573 , 1100 , and 1181 , with the first two shown to be spectroscopic binaries .",
    "we adopt mermilliod et al.s view that this quartet are non - members and list these stars in table 2 .",
    "some members were shown to be spectroscopic binaries .",
    "binaries not yet shown to be double - lined are included in the list of 70 members and identified in the final column in table 1 ; all seven fall near the main sequence locus in a color - magnitude diagram suggesting the secondary star contributes very little to the composite spectrum .",
    "patience et al .",
    "( 2002 ) report on an imaging search for close binaries among known cluster members ; these authors made no independent determinations of membership .",
    "a large fraction of our stars was examined by patience et al . with",
    "the majority reported not to have a companion that would have contributed to our spectrum which we have assumed is that of a single star .",
    "four stars were excluded as unsuitable for analysis on the basis of the reported imaging ; these have companions separated by less than 0.5 arc seconds and rather similar masses .",
    "the stars are # 696 ( also known as # 1538 ) , 935 , 1541 and 1598 .    in summary , 70 of the 86 stars are considered to be cluster members ( table 1 ) .",
    "information provided in table 1 is as follows : the webda # is in column 1 , the adopted stellar parameters are in columns 2 , 3 , and 4 .",
    "the projected rotational velocity ( _ v _ sin _ i _ ) in column 7 is primarily taken from prosser ( 1992 ) .",
    "the equivalent width of the lii 6707   feature is given for stars with low _",
    "i _ in column 8 and the derived li abundance is in column 9 .",
    "columns 10 , 11 , and 12 summarize the membership status of the star as given by prosser ( 1992 ) , makarov ( 2006 ) and mermilliod et al .",
    "the final column identifies the seven stars that are spectroscopic binaries .",
    "these seven are members and , it is assumed , that the secondary star is too faint to contribute to the spectrum .",
    "they are therefore included with the single stars in table 1 and in our analyses .",
    "sixteen stars , originally classified as members by prosser ( 1992 ) , have subsequently been identified as non - members , single - lined or double - lined spectroscopic binaires , or close double stars .",
    "the nature of these stars and the source of the revised information is listed in table 2 which has the same format as table 1 .",
    "the stars are not rejected outright from our sample .",
    "rather , temperatures , rotational velocities and li and fe abundances were determined as for the members and the results are discussed with caveats and questions in sections 6.2 and 6.3 .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      stars cooler than about 5500 k appear to fall in a widening band of declining lithium with decreasing temperature ( figure 3 ) .",
    "there seems to be a lower envelope , defined by low _ v _",
    "i _ stars , running from a li abundance of about @xmath5 n(li ) = 2.5 at 5500 k to @xmath5 n(li ) = @xmath10.4 at 4500 k , and an upper envelope running through high _ v _ sin _ i _ stars k with a li abundance of around @xmath5 n(li ) = 3.0 at 5500 k and then falling to a li abundance of @xmath5 n(li ) = 0.0 at 4200 k. the width of the band at temperatures less than 4700 k is about 1.5 dex , a width resembling that for the pleiades , a cluster about 20 to 30 myr older than @xmath0 per ( soderblom et al . 1993 ; sestito & randich 2005 ) ) .",
    "xiong & deng ( 2005 ) in a discussion on the li abundances provided by the bls sample drew attention to a scatter appearing around the colour index ( v@xmath1i@xmath6 ) = 1.03 or about 4700 k. this was about the cool end of bls s sample .",
    "our expanded sample shows that the scatter begins at a somewhat warmer temperature around 5600 k and extends to cooler temperatures .",
    "the li distribution band is sketched in figure 4 . accepting the outliers discussed in the previous section as members ,",
    "the li distribution band in the cooler stars can be extended to warmer temperatures with the upper and lower bands asymptoting to the li plateau value at 7000 k. the dispersion in li may begin at 6500 k , though additional stars are required to define this spread , and gradually widen in the cooler stars .     per ( as in figure 3 ) .",
    "red triangles are data added from randich et al .",

    "( 1998 ) provided li abundances for 18 x - ray selected members of the cluster .",
    "an additional five stars were analysed but declared to be non - members .",
    "the spectra were at a resolution of 1  but lines blended with the lii doublet were taken into account in the analysis .",

    "this suggests that we may add these x - ray selected stars to our sample .",

    ", abundances from randich et al .",
    "are included along with ours and lines drawn to represent the possible upper and lower envelopes to the li abundance variation with effective temperature .",
    "these additional stars at @xmath9 k tend to populate the upper half of the band between our suggested upper and lower envelopes .",
    "unfortunately , the new points provide few high _ v _ sin _ i _ objects .",
    "scatter at temperatures below about 5500 k can not be attributed to the standard sources of uncertainty ( incorrect effective temperature , uncertainties in measuring the 6707   feature , contamination of the sample by nonmembers , etc . ) .",
    "several ideas have been suggested linking the li abundance scatter at least in part to the failure of classical model atmospheres ( as used here ) to represent the real atmospheres of these young late - type dwarfs . in section 6.2",
    "we discussed our k i data for four stars around 5900 k. our data include k i equivalent widths for two additional stars at 5000 k , # 174 and # 1697 , both bonafide cluster members ( table 5 ) .",
    "these data also do not provide any support for a link between high li abundance and chromospheric activity .",
    "rather the larger k i eqw corresponds to the star with the smaller li abundance .      in figure 4 , the stars designated as double stars and double - lined spectroscopic binaries in table 2 are shown by symbols of different colors as indicated in the legend accompanying the figure .",
    "the four double stars with separations of 0.5 arc seconds or less lie well within the li distribution band of the normal stars .",
    "the spectra of these stars appear to not have been significantly contaminated by the presence of the nearby star and future analyses may simply include them as member stars .    with the exception of # 1713 , the double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( green triangles ) also lie well within the li band of the cluster members . their measured li abundances may be regarded as lower limits to the value that would be obtained if the continuum contamination of the secondary was properly accouted for .",
    "any further interpretation of their abundances would require a rigorous analysis that takes into account the continuum and line spectrum of both stars .",
    "surprisingly three of the four stars identified as non - members by mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) : # 143 , # 1181 and # 1100 , have li abundances that are entirely compatible with the mean cluster trend .",
    "the star # 1181 is coincident with # 588 , a rapidly rotating cluster member , # 143 lies on the lower li envelope of the cluster , and # 1100 is in the proximity of # 1604 , the outlier star that we found no reason to exclude from the sample .",
    "the three stars were deemed to be non - members by mermilliod et al .",
    "( 2008 ) on the basis of their radial velocity and proper motion alone ; all three lie on the cluster s color - magnitude diagram and are therefore at the distance of the cluster .",
    "this combination of facts makes the three stars rather enigmatic .",
    "the relatively large lithium abundances of these stars compared to field stars would make them not much older than a few hundred myr ; the likelihood of relatively young interloper stars in the field of view of the cluster and at the distance of the cluster must be rather small",
    ".    the two remaining stars identified as non - members , # 573 and # 407 , may be field stars .",
    "the former appears to lie in the region of the li - dip and the latter has a low enough li abundance to be consistent with field star values ( chen et al .",
    "we note , however , that # 407 has a rather large rotational velocity ( _ v _ sin _ i _",
    "= 28 km s@xmath10 ) , which is unusual in a field g star . in summary ,",
    "all of the five stars categorized as non - members may warrant closer scrutiny .",
    "in the introduction , we referred to the powerful role that is played by open clusters in placing observational constraints on lithium depletion in pre - main sequence ( pms ) and main sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "perhaps , the principal outstanding questions about lithium depletion concern the onset of the depletion and the star - to - star spread in ( apparent ) lithium abundances at low masses .",
    "( there remains too the incompletely understood li - dip in warm older stars . ) in order to determine when lithium depletion at low masses develops , and how it evolves with time , depletion of li must be traced from the earliest pms phases to the age of the @xmath0 per cluster and beyond .",
    "pms lithium depletion is now mappable by looking at the very youngest of clusters and associations ; the stars are faint but accessible with large telescopes .",
    "in addition to the uncertainty of defining membership in clusters , associations and moving groups , there are several problems associated with interpreting their li abundance trends .",
    "first , since young pms stars of different masses tend to lie in the same temperature range between 3000 k to 4000 k as they evolve down the hr diagram , and older pms stars rapidly increase their temperature as they evolve towards the main sequence , the temperature of the pms star is not a sufficient indication of its mass and determination of stellar mass requires the use of theoretical evolutionary tracks which continue to differ from author to author .",
    "this difficulty may be offset partly by the result that theoretical prediction of a cluster s age from the location of the lithium depletion boundary ( ldb ) is not very dependent on which set of pms evolutionary tracks is chosen ( jeffries & oliveira 2005 ) .",
    "second , because the young pms stars are cool , analysis of their spectra is complicated by molecular features and the derived li abundance has a larger uncertainty than in warmer main sequence stars .    for these reasons and because the available data are limited with respect both to the number of young clusters , associations , and moving groups and to the number of stars per cluster , we defer a detailed search for the onset of lithium depletion at low masses .",
    "it is worth noting that an interesting set of li data in a range of young clusters and associations has been accumulated ( _ e.g. _ sestito & randich 2005 , mentuch et al . 2008 ) . in their table 1 ,",
    "sestito & randich ( 2005 ) list the classical ages of clusters , i.e. , those determined from isochrone fitting . for four young clusters in their sample ,",
    "ic 2391 , ngc 2547 , @xmath0 per and the pleiades , new independent estimates of the ages have been obtained based on the position of ldb ( stauffer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; barrado y navascues et al .",
    "2004 , jeffries & oliviera 2005 ) which are , in general , higher than the classical ages .",
    "although the ldb technique is less model dependent than ms fitting , sestito & randich chose to adopt the classical ages for uniformity through the entire sample . in our discussion of clusters chosen from sestito & randich ( 2005 ) , including @xmath0 per and the pleiades , we have adopted these same classical ages .    on the other hand , the ages of the young associations studied by mentuch et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , that we compare the results of @xmath0 per and the pleiades to , are derived by comparing the dependence of li abundance on temperature with isochrones from pre - ms evolutionary tracks .",
    "mentuch et al .",
    "state that these ages are consistent with the earlier estimates based on isochrone fitting or other methods .",
    "we will not analyze the strengths and weaknesses of cluster age determinations in our discussions .",
    "rather , we note that the crucial point is that the ordering of the clusters according to age is robust .",
    "when comparing the results of li scatter in these young associations with those of clusters from sestito & randich ( 2005 ) with classical ages , the chronological order of ages is not disturbed even if we adopt the higher ldb ages for the 4 young clusters , namely , ngc 2547 , ic 2391 , @xmath0 per and the pleiades .",
    "it is therefore worth examining the star samples of these associations with those of @xmath0 per and other clusters .",
    "sestito & randich list ngc 2264 at 5 myr as their youngest cluster with the survey of li abundances from soderblom et al .",
    "the li abundance for the warmer stars in ngc 2264 is about 3.2 , a value consistent with our result for the hotter stars in @xmath0 per and also with the canonical value for an initial li abundance for young stars .",
    "stars between 0.5 and 1.0 m@xmath11 in ngc 2264 show only a mild ( 0.4 dex ) li dispersion . given measurement and analyses uncertainties",
    ", one may conclude that pms depletion has possibly not begun in these young stars .",
    "mild pms depletion may be seen in the 12 myr old @xmath12cha cluster and tw hydrae association ( mentuch et al .",
    "2008 ) . by 20 myr ,",
    "the @xmath13 pic moving group and by 27 myr the tucanae - horologium association show nearly a 3.0 dex range in li abundance ( see figure 8 in mentuch et al .",
    "however , in the absence of reliable mass determinations , the presence or absence of an abundance disperson at a particular mass can not be deciphered .",
    "a clearer view of li dispersion at a particular mass may be obtained once the cluster is on the main sequence .",
    "sestito & randich ( 2005 ) list ic 2602 , ic 2391 , ic 4665 , and ngc 2547 as main sequence clusters younger than @xmath0 per .",
    "impression of a smaller star - to - star scatter in li abundances in clusters younger than @xmath0 per is conveyed by results for ic 2602 with an age of 30 myr ( randich et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "randich et al .",
    "( 2001 ) define a regression curve to represent li abundances from 3900 k to 6900 k. this curve is above the upper envelope in figure 4 for @xmath14 k and coincident with it for higher temperatures . to effect a fair comparison ,",
    "a correction would need to be made for the mass - dependent temperature change between an age of 30 myr and 50 myr .",
    "little additional li depletion is predicted in this interval .",
    "the point of interest here is that the scatter about the regression curve is at most @xmath15dex , often much less , and less than exhibited in figure 3 .",
    "indeed , most points in the equivalent plot to figure 3 ( randich et al.s ( 2001 ) figure 4 ) touch the regression curve with their error bars .",
    "a similar conclusion applies to ic 2391 , also 30 myrs old , from inspection of the same figure 4 which assembles li abundances from that paper and stauffer et al .",
    "( 1989b ) . for ic 4665 at 35 myr , the available li abundances ( martn & montes 1997 ; jeffries et al .",
    "2009 ) are too few at low temperatures to define the li abundance trend with temperature and certainly not to detect a star - to - star variation .",
    "for ngc 2547 also at 35 myr , there is evidence of a variation approaching that seen in figure 3 ( jeffries et al .",
    "2003 ) with a lower envelope to the li abundances resembling that of the upper envelope in figure 4 .",
    "one may speculate from these comparisons that the dispersion in li at a given mass develops and strengthens between 30 and 50 myr , that is between the ages of ic 2391 and ic 2602 and the age of @xmath0 per .",
    "this is further corroborated by observations of the ab doradus moving group by mentuch et al .",
    "( 2008 ) which has an age of 45 myr , very similar to that of @xmath0 per . with the additional caveats that the sample is small and there are membership issues in defining a moving group",
    ", we compare our @xmath0 per sample with that of ab dor .",
    "the comparison is frustrated because mentuch et al .",
    "( 2008 ) systematically find an abundance @xmath5n(li ) @xmath16 in their samples for stars that are unaffected by pms depletion .",
    "this ` initial ' value is about 0.6 dex greater than our value for the hotter stars .",
    "we have adopted the view that the high initial abundance is a consequence of a systematic overestimate of the li abundance but we have no basis for knowing if this overestimate carries over to lower temperatures . between 5300 k and 4900 k ,",
    "four ab dor stars have li abundances between 3.4 and 1.3 ; the range is comparable to that seen in @xmath0 per and larger than that seen in the sestio & randich ( 2005 ) survey .",

    "( 1993 , see also king et al .",

    "1997 ) . here",
    ", the star - to - star scatter remains similar to that of the pleiades and @xmath0 per but the mean abundances are smaller . by the age of the hyades , only upper limits to the li i equivalent width are measurable in stars @xmath20 5000 k ( soderblom et al . 1995 ) .    in summary ,",
    "the li abundances for @xmath0 per fit the pattern provided by observations of clusters both younger and older than it .",
    "the star - to - star spread appears to develop after about 20 myr .",
    "the spread survives up to 250 myr and its demise is hidden from observers as main sequence lithium depletion removes any inequalities in lithium abundance from observers view .",
    "inspection of figures 3 and 4 shows a relative dearth of measurements at temperatures lower than about 4700 k. additional members of the @xmath0 per cluster are to be found in prosser ( 1992 ) .",
    "although expansion of the sample at lower temperatures would be informative , perhaps the most useful benefit from an enlarged sample , would be an application of the best techniques of quantitative stellar spectroscopy to pairs of stars with maximum and minimum li abundance but similar observed properties such as colour and rotation period .",
