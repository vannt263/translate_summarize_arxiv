    "[ muontime ] the measured time difference between the signals of the muon detector and the vertical hodoscope is shown for an individual muon element of the positive arm . a global time resolution of 1.3  ns",
    "is observed , with a very small background level .",
    "the way to suppress muons at the trigger level would be to include the muon counter signals into the anti - coincidence trigger logic .",
    "because of the high background load to the muon detector , one might dangerously suppress useful pion events if they happen to occur on - time with background signals in the muon detector .",
    "that is why the option to use off - line the muon detector information has been chosen . in the off - line analysis only the events with muon counter hits correlated in time with those of other detectors are tagged as `` muon '' events and thus rejected @xcite . from the analysis of experimental data",
    "we have inferred that the fraction of such events , containing at least one muon , is about 10% @xcite .",
    "such muon - events originate to a large extent ( @xmath25 80% ) from @xmath88-decays in the path between the dc and the muon counter systems ( decays upstream the dc are mostly suppressed by the trigger system and thus contribute less to the collected event sample ) .",
    "the trigger system was designed to provide a reduction of the event rate to a level acceptable to the data acquisition system which is around 2000 events / spill .",
    "pion pairs are produced in the target mainly in a free state with a wide distribution over their relative momentum @xmath59 , whereas atomic pairs from @xmath89 disintegration have very low @xmath59 , typically below 3  mev/@xmath1 .",
    "the on - line data selection rejects events with pion pairs having @xmath90  mev/@xmath1 or @xmath91  mev/@xmath1 or @xmath92  mev/@xmath1 , keeping at the same time high efficiency for detection of pairs with @xmath59 components below these values , ( @xmath93 and @xmath94 are longitudinal and transversal components of the relative momentum , respectively . )",
    "a multilevel trigger is used in dirac @xcite .",
    "it comprises a simple and fast first level trigger and higher level trigger processors which apply selection criteria to different components of the relative momentum of pion pairs .    due to the requirements of the data analysis procedure ,",
    "the on - line selection of only time correlated ( prompt ) pion pairs , originating from a single proton - target interaction and detected simultaneously by both spectrometer arms , is not enough .",
    "in addition , a large number of uncorrelated , accidental , pion pairs is also necessary .",
    "these accidental pairs are used in the off - line analysis to describe the relative momentum distribution of free ( non - atomic ) pion pairs without coulomb interaction in the final state .",
    "therefore , the trigger system should apply very similar selection criteria to prompt and accidental events , within a preselected coincidence time window centred around the peak of prompt events .",
    "the statistical error of the @xmath89 lifetime measurement depends on the number of both prompt and accidental detected pairs . in standard experimental conditions ,",
    "the optimal ratio of prompt to accidental events is obtained using a 40  ns wide coincidence time window between the times measured in the left ( vh1 ) and right ( vh2 ) vertical hodoscopes .    since 1999 ,",
    "when the experiment has started , the trigger architecture was upgraded several times to achieve a larger reduction of the background event rate ( prompt and accidental pairs with large values of @xmath59 ) . in the present article",
    "we briefly describe the most recent version .",
    "distance in the upstream spectrometer region ( for rejection of high @xmath95 ) using the data from sfd and ih .",

    "a detailed description of t2 and t3 is given in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "[ structure ] . the first level trigger t1 starts digitisation of the detector signals in the data acquisition ( daq ) modules ( adc , tdc , etc . ) . at the next level",
    "the neural network trigger dna / rna ( dirac neural atomic and revised neural atomic trigger ) rejects the events with high @xmath59 values . at the last stage , a powerful drift chamber trigger processor t4 imposes additional constraints to the relative momentum and takes the final decision to accept or to reject the event .",
    "in addition to the main trigger designed to detect pionic atoms , several calibration triggers are run in parallel .",
    "they are applied to daq directly , without suppression by higher level trigger stages but with appropriate prescaling factors .",
    "the first level trigger ( a detailed description is given in @xcite ) fulfils the following tasks :    * selects events with signals in both detector arms downstream the magnet . *",
    "classifies the particle in each arm as @xmath88 or @xmath97 depending on the presence of the cherenkov counter signal .",
    "protons , kaons and muons are equally included in the `` pion '' class , their identification is performed in the off - line analysis .",
    "* arranges the coincidences between the signals detected in the two arms .",
    "the width of the coincidence time window defines the ratio between yields of prompt and accidental events in the collected data .",
    "* applies a coplanarity criterion to particle pairs : the difference between the hit slab numbers in the horizontal hodoscopes in the two arms ( hh1 and hh2 ) should be @xmath98 .",
    "this criterion forces a selection on the @xmath94 component of the relative momentum and provides a rate reduction by a factor of 2 .",
    "* selects in parallel events from several physics processes needed for the setup calibration : @xmath65 pairs , @xmath99 decays , @xmath100 decays to three charged pions .",
    "the physics and calibration trigger signals pass through the mask register and , after proper prescaling , are combined with an or function .",
    "any trigger type can be enabled or disabled by proper programming of the mask register .",
    "independent prescaling of each sub - trigger channel allows to adjust their relative rate with respect to the rate of the main trigger . a specific trigger mark",
    "is recorded for every event to allow sorting the data by trigger type during off - line analysis and on - line monitoring .",
    "all t1 modules are ecl line programmable multichannel camac units .",
    "most of them are commercial modules , except for the dedicated coplanarity processor which has been custom - developed at jinr .",
    "meantimer units are used in all vh and hh channels to remove the dependence of the time measurement on the hit location , thus reducing the total trigger time jitter .",
    "the dna / rna trigger @xcite is a processing system using a neural network algorithm .",
    "its hardware is based on the custom - built version of the neural trigger used in the cplear experiment @xcite .",
    "dna / rna receives ( see fig .  [ rna ] ) the hit patterns from the vertical hodoscopes vh1 , vh2 and the x - planes of the upstream detectors : the ionisation hodoscope ( ih ) and the scintillating fibre detector ( sfd ) . for low @xmath59 events the hits in these detectors are correlated .",
    "the neural network was trained to select particle pairs with low relative momenta : @xmath101  mev/@xmath1 , @xmath102  mev/@xmath1 and @xmath103  mev/@xmath1 .",
    "the events which do not satisfy any of those conditions are considered `` bad '' and rejected .    the dna / rna logic",
    "is started by a fast pretrigger , t0 , and in 250  ns evaluates an event .",
    "rate reduction by a factor of 2 with respect to t1 is achieved with dna / rna .",
    "t4 is the final trigger stage .",
    "t4 processor reconstructs straight tracks in the x - projection of the drift chambers and analyses them to determine the value of the relative momentum ( the algorithm is described in @xcite ) .",
    "the block diagram of the t4 operation is shown in fig .  [ t4 ] .",
    "the drift chamber processor includes two stages : the track finder and the track analyser .",
    "the track finder ( an identical processor is used for each arm ) receives the numbers of the hit wires from all drift chamber x - planes .",
    "drift time values are not used in the t4 logic . a unique number , `` track identifier '' , which contains the encoded numbers of the hit wires ,",
    "is associated to the found track .",
    "if tracks are found in both arms , the track analyser continues the event evaluation .",
    "the track analyser receives the track identifiers from both arms and compares them with the content of a look - up memory table which contains all possible combinations of track identifiers for pion pairs with @xmath103  mev/@xmath1 and @xmath101  mev/@xmath1 .",
    "these `` allowed '' combinations are obtained from a dedicated simulation using the precise geometry of the setup .",
    "if a relevant combination is found , the t4 processor generates a positive decision signal which starts the data transfer to the vme buffer memories .",
    "otherwise , the clear and reset signals are applied to the daq and trigger systems .",
    "the t4 decision time depends on the complexity of the event and is around 3.5  @xmath23s on average .",
    "the rejection factor of t4 is around 5 with respect to the t1 rate and around 2.5 with respect to dna / rna .",
    "the whole trigger system is fully computer controlled : no hardware intervention is needed in order to modify the trigger configuration . with all selection stages",
    "enabled the event rate at the typical experimental conditions is around 700 per spill , that is well below the limits of the daq rate capability .",
    "the architecture of hardware and software parts of the data acquisition system takes into account the time structure of the proton beam .",
    "the machine super - cycle of the cern ps accelerator has 1520  s duration . within",
    "this period dirac receives protons in spills of 400450  ms width , from 1 to 5 spills per super - cycle .",
    "the interval between consecutive spills can be as short as 1  s.    during the accelerator burst the data from all detectors are read out into vme buffer memories ( commercial and dedicated electronic modules ) without any software intervention .",
    "the data transfer to vme processor boards , event building , data transfer to the main host computer and other relatively slow operations are performed during the pause between bursts .",
    "this provides the maximum operation rate of daq .",
    "the information comes from 2048 channels of microstrip gas chambers , 800 channels of scintillating fibre detector , 2016 channels of drift chambers and 224 channels of other scintillation and cherenkov detectors . for every channel",
    "the time or amplitude information is recorded or both .",
    "in addition to a main readout mode , the readout of scalers at the end of every spill is arranged via a camac bus .",
    "the counting rates of all the detectors , trigger rates at different trigger levels and for different sub - trigger modes are recorded together with the value of the beam intensity provided by the ps complex .",
    "the data readout @xcite is arranged with 12 readout branches : 4 branches for gem / msgc , 3 branches for dc and 5 fera @xcite branches for all other detectors . in fera and dc branches the vme modules ceshsm1870 and",
    "lecroy1190 are used as buffer memories . in gem",
    "/ msgc branches the buffer memories are incorporated into dedicated vme modules @xcite .",
    "fera branches include different fera compatible lecroy modules : adc4300b , multi - hit tdc3377 , universal logic modules 2366 configured in this application like fera registers and scalers .",
    "peculiarities of fera readout in dirac , such as multi - gate and fast clear operation , are described in @xcite .",
    "the logic of readout is the following . the first level trigger t1 starts digitisation in adc and tdc of fera and dc branches ( see fig .  [ structure ] in section `` trigger system '' ) .",
    "readout is inhibited unless a positive decision of the highest level trigger t4 is received .",
    "if the t4 processor decides positively , the inhibit readout status is released and the converted event data are transferred to buffer memories . if the decision of dna / rna or t4 is negative , then a fast clear signal is generated @xcite which discards the data in all fera modules and dc registers .",
    "in contrast to fera and dc subsystems , the processing of gem / msgc data is started by the next level dna / rna trigger .",
    "this reduces the dead time introduced by the clear process which in gem / msgc electronics takes longer .",
    "thus , the negative decisions of t4 only lead to clearing of the gem / msgc data .",
    "if no clear signal is received , the converted data are transferred to buffer memories .",
    "the readout of the whole event takes 45  @xmath23s and is defined by a fixed acquisition time of gem / msgc which exceeds the readout time in other branches .      the main part of the daq software @xcite is running on two vme processor boards and on the main daq host .",
    "powerpc - based vme processor boards control the trigger and fera readout electronics via two camac branch drivers , operate vme modules , read data from buffer memories and transfer them to the main daq host .",
    "the main daq host performs event building , records the built data and distributes them to other computers for on - line monitoring and analysis .",
    "the daq software is written in c programming language and is running under unix - like operating systems : lynx - os ( vme processors ) and linux ( main daq host ) .",
    "the schematic layout of the data acquisition processes is presented in fig .",
    "the basic processes running on vme and main daq hosts and on one of the monitoring computers are shown .",
    "only one vme processor is shown for simplicity .",
    "the daq software can be divided into more or less independent groups .",
    "the first one is a set of programs for data readout ( runs on vme boards ) and event building ( runs on the main daq host ) . during the event building the data",
    "are checked for consistency using the headers and the serial numbers of sub - events provided by the detector readout electronics .",
    "the serial numbers allow to check that all buffer memories contain the same number of sub - events and that different sub - events correspond to each other .",
    "the second group consists of programs for data distribution over the network for on - line monitoring .",
    "the group includes a primary data receiver and secondary data senders / receivers .",
    "the primary receiver is the only program which receives data directly from the event builder and is critical for the data acquisition : other processes of this group may either be or not be running and may be started or stopped at any time .",
    "the third group of programs allows to control the run status via a graphical user interface : to set the run parameters , to select the trigger type , to change the run status ( start , stop , suspend etc . ) .",
    "this group includes also a run display program which delivers information about the current run conditions .",
    "the fourth group is a set of slow - control processes providing a uniform access to hardware from any host participating in daq .",
    "the tasks of these programs are , for example , high voltage control , vme and camac module initialisation and so on .",
    "the whole daq system is able to accept data from five consecutive bursts in one accelerator super - cycle with up to 2  mbytes per burst ( this corresponds to  2000 triggers per burst ) and to distribute events to all hosts participating in on - line data processing .",
    "the limitation comes from the capacity of the vme buffer memories .",
    "an on - line monitoring program receives the data distributed by the main daq process .",
    "the program fulfils accumulation of several hundred histograms , including all raw signal spectra from any detector as well as spectra obtained after a fast preliminary data handling .",
    "the software is written in the frame of root software package .",
    "the program delivers the following information :    * time and amplitude distributions for every counter . *",
    "hit and multiplicity distributions .",
    "* correlation plots for hits in different detectors .",
    "* beam profile on the experimental target , beam spill time structure . * some specific data for selected detectors ( cluster size for gem / msgc etc . ) .",
    "* event rates for different trigger modes running in parallel and their timing .",
    "* information about the data taking process as a whole : burst data volume , event volume , time of event in burst etc .",
    "proper setting of the corresponding program parameter allows selection of the trigger type for which all the above operations should be fulfilled .",
    "for example , the histograms can be obtained separately for @xmath65 , @xmath0 , @xmath104 and any other trigger or for all accepted triggers .",
    "apart from the common program , there are dedicated monitoring programs developed for more detailed control of individual detectors .",
    "the experimental setup is designed to provide high efficiency for detection of @xmath105 pairs with small opening angle in the laboratory frame ( @xmath106 3  mrad ) and small relative momentum in the center of mass frame ( @xmath107 3   mev/@xmath1 ) .",
    "detector resolution and multiple coulomb scattering in the target and setup elements affect the measurement accuracy .",
    "detector resolution leads to a linear increase of the relative error @xmath108 with increasing momentum value , whereas multiple scattering contributes a constant term to the momentum uncertainty . with an experimental space resolution of 90  @xmath23 m in the dc system and 50  @xmath23 m in the gem / msgc detectors , the uncertainty on the coordinate and momentum measurements",
    "are mainly determined by the description of the multiple scattering errors .    both momentum and",
    "the opening angle measurement accuracies affect the precision on the measurement of the relative momentum @xmath59 of the pion pair .",
    "the momentum accuracy @xmath108 is 0.3@xmath109 , at @xmath110 = 2   gev/@xmath1 , almost independent on momentum .",
    "the kinematics of @xmath105 pairs originating from the ionisation of @xmath10 atoms in the target requires ability on two - track separation in the upstream detector region better than 1.5  mm in most of the cases .",
    "the experimental double track resolution is limited by the granularity and signal clustering of the upstream detectors and with current algorithms is about 0.4  mm .",
    "thus , the accuracy on the measurement of the longitudinal ( @xmath96 ) and transversal components ( @xmath95 and @xmath94 ) of @xmath59 is 0.6  mev/@xmath1 ( @xmath96 ) and 0.4  mev/@xmath1 ( @xmath95 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "these errors arise from the estimated contribution of multiple scattering in the detectors and setup elements , according to our present knowledge of the experimental data .",
    "in fact , the effect of multiple scattering in the foil target increases the error in @xmath95 and @xmath94 to up 1  mev/@xmath1 .     pairs .",
    "events were selected from a sample of @xmath104 calibration data.,width=453,height=302 ]    the calibration of the energy scale and the experimental determination of the setup resolution are performed by monitoring the position and the width of the @xmath104 detected by the apparatus .",
