    "in the present work , we consider a simple theoretical model system of non - interacting spinless electrons which are restricted to move in one dimension around the circumference of a clean , one - channel aharonov - bohm ring .",

    "abb : model ] ) .",
    "this may lead to dephasing of the electron motion on the ring , apart from other effects like renormalization of the electron masses and introduction of an effective coupling between the electrons .",
    "we treat the full dynamics of the fluctuating flux coupled to the electron system in a selfconsistent manner , rather than prescribing an external stochastic time - dependent classical field . in order to achieve this ,",

    "the fluctuations couple to the electrons via the vector - potential term in the kinetic energy . as an important special case for the bath spectrum",
    "we treat the nyquist noise that may be due to the equilibrium current fluctuations in the external coil producing the flux .",
    "equilibrium and transport properties of this model system are analyzed for the cases of zero and finite temperatures , taking into account the coupling to the bath and the pauli principle with respect to the electron system .",
    "in particular , we discuss the single - particle and two - particle green s functions , level widths , energy shifts and dephasing times , and the reduction of the persistent current due to the fluctuations . in each case , the dependence on the coupling strength between system and bath and on the low - frequency spectral properties of the bath is examined .",
    "aharonov - bohm interference observed in cotunneling through the ring is discussed in order to analyze the coherence properties of the electrons on the ring under the influence of the fluctuating flux in a transport situation . as a result of our calculation",
    ", we find that the fluctuations do _ not _ lead to dephasing in the _ linear _ transport regime at _ zero _ temperature .",
    "the single - particle version of this model has been considered before in ref . in order to determine whether persistent currents in a normal metal ring may be destroyed by coupling to an ohmic bath . whereas the authors of ref .",
    "used the feynman - vernon influence functional@xcite , we will apply a different , more direct approach .",
    "we emphasize that our analysis is restricted to baths weaker than the ohmic bath ( see the discussion after eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) ) .",
    "the possibility of _ spontaneous _ persistent currents was investigated ( and ruled out ) in ref .  , using a luttinger liquid picture for the electrons and taking into account their electromagnetic self - interaction .",
    "dephasing of a single electron going around the two arms of an aharonov - bohm ring has been considered both in ref .  , using the influence functional , and in ref .  , using a semiclassical picture . in the latter article ,",
    "the connection between phase fluctuations and the trace left by the system in the environment was emphasized .",
    "more recently , the question of dephasing in mesoscopic systems has received renewed attention due to a set of weak - localization measurements which have shown a saturation of the dephasing time at low temperatures @xcite . motivated in part by these puzzling findings , the authors of refs .",

    "in the following section , we will define the model and discuss some simple consequences as well as some features which can not be included in this system easily .",
    "then we give a short qualitative discussion of dephasing for the simplified case of a classical fluctuating flux ( represented by a random process ) .",
    "similar considerations are applied to the calculation of the green s function for a single electron on the ring , both with classical and quantum fluctuations .",
    "the resulting energy shifts and level shapes are analyzed in some detail , since these results can be taken over to the many - particle calculation of the single - particle and two - particle green s functions which is presented in section [ sec : manyparticle ] together with the evaluation of the grand canonical partition sum and the persistent current . after discussing the physical meaning of the dephasing produced by the nyquist noise at low temperatures , we turn to an analysis of aharonov - bohm interference in a cotunneling transport measurement .",

    "this is the `` thermodynamic limit '' of an infinite bath which is necessary to describe truly irreversible , dissipative dynamics .",

    "it incorporates the electron charge and the circumference of the ring , since the line - integral of the vector potential around the ring gives the flux .",
    "any external _ static _",
    "magnetic flux @xmath15 has to be added in the kinetic energy expression .",
    "we assume the interaction between system and bath to be sufficiently weak , such that the bath may be treated as linear in a good approximation ( like it is usually done in the theory of quantum dissipative systems , see ref . for a more detailed discussion ) . apart from this assumption , the expression eq .",
    "( [ testmark ] ) used for the fluctuating flux is still completely general .",
    "we are free to choose the frequencies of the bath oscillators to obtain any desired correlation function of @xmath16 , which is the only quantity that affects the dissipative system dynamics in this model .",
    "note as well that the coupling of the velocity to a vector potential assumed in eq .",
    "( [ thehamiltonian ] ) has been shown@xcite to be equivalent to a caldeira - leggett model with the usual coordinate - type coupling for a particle moving on an infinite line .",
    "physically , the coupling used here is the natural choice for a situation in which the vector potential is linearly related to the fluctuating current in an external coil .",
    "the fluctuations ( and linear response ) of the current then determine the bath correlator discussed in the next section .",
    "the correlator of @xmath9 will determine the dephasing rate and other important quantities via its low - frequency properties .",
    "for the discrete set of oscillators and for the continuum limit , respectively , it is given by the following expressions , where the average @xmath17 is taken with respect to the unperturbed set of oscillators :    @xmath18 \\nonumber",

    "note that the @xmath21 is equal to @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the bose - einstein distribution function .",
    "the _ special case of nyquist noise _ is obtained by the requirement that for high temperatures , the spectrum of fluctuations of the magnetic flux ( i.e. of @xmath9 ) is white . since @xmath24 for @xmath25 ,",
    "this means @xmath26 ( for small @xmath27 ) .",
    "before we proceed to the calculations , we will point out some simplifying features of this situation as well as some important aspects of the dephasing problem in degenerate fermion systems that are beyond the scope of this model .",
    "the magnetic flux is assumed to thread the ring in such a way that the situation is axially symmetric with respect to the axis which goes through the center of the ring and is perpendicular to its plane . in this case",
    ", we can choose the gauge such that the vector potential is everywhere tangential to the ring and of constant magnitude around the whole circumference .",
    "the same holds for the electric field , which is given by the time - derivative of the vector potential .",
    "this is analogous to the caldeira - leggett treatment of one - dimensional quantum brownian motion of a free particle , with the formal difference that in our case the force is derived from a vector potential instead of a scalar potential@xcite .",
    "it is the choice appropriate for a system with periodic boundary conditions , where the quantization of momenta , the aharonov - bohm effect and persistent currents play a role .",
    "note that under different circumstances the assumption of a force which is constant in space is only valid within the dipole approximation for a particle that is restricted to move in a well - localized region of space , because otherwise the finite wavelength of the bath modes ( phonons etc . )",
    "becomes important .",
    "since the coupling between system and bath is via the momentum , which commutes with the electron hamiltonian and therefore is a constant of the motion for the original uncoupled electron system ( `` diagonal coupling '' ) , some features of this model are very simple : in spite of the interaction with the bath , the momentum of a particle will stay constant , only its velocity and kinetic energy can fluctuate .",
    "this simplifies the many - electron problem as well : although the fluctuating force influences the center - of - mass motion of the electrons and introduces some kind of `` effective interaction '' between them , the occupation of different @xmath3-states can not be changed by the bath .",
    "note that this simplification would be spoiled if one takes into account impurities and/or a coupling that depends on the position .",
    "for example , the latter would arise if one considered an arbitrary fluctuating electromagnetic field or the electric field between the plates of a capacitor , which is a constant vector field in space but is not constant with respect to its projection onto the direction of motion of the electrons on the ring .",
    "other situations where the coupling depends on position include interaction with phonons or a localized spin on the ring .    in its single - particle version ,",
    "the hamiltonian given above also arises in the discussion of dephasing for a charged island , if the coupling to the bath ( e.g. a fluctuating gate voltage ) is purely diagonal in the system s eigenbasis and can only lead to fluctuations in the energy levels .",
    "note , however , that questions of interest here like tunneling into the ring or features of the many - particle system have no natural counterpart in that rather simple situation .",
    "although in our model all electrons are coupled to the same flux , which introduces a kind of effective interaction between them , the decay rates of green s functions will not show any dependence on the distance to the fermi surface , in contrast to the usual behaviour of interacting fermi systems .",
    "this is due to the diagonal coupling between system and bath , which means that there are no energy - relaxation processes which change the occupation numbers of the electrons and which would feel the restriction by the pauli principle .",
    "a related question arises in the study of dephasing in degenerate fermion systems : if the coupling is not diagonal in the electrons ( single - particle ) eigenstates , the system variable which couples to the bath ( in our case the momentum ) carries out fluctuations itself . in a semiclassical single - particle calculation",
    ", these fluctuations pick out the high - frequency components of the bath spectrum@xcite . therefore , according to such a calculation , there is dephasing even in the case of a bath spectrum that vanishes at low frequencies and this implies that at low temperatures , the high - frequency zero point fluctuations of the bath contribute heavily to dephasing _ in this picture_. however , if the electron system is nearly degenerate , many of its transitions will be blocked by the pauli principle so that such an effect will be strongly suppressed .",
    "although we can not investigate this point in our model , related considerations will occur in our discussion of the cotunneling setup in section [ abcotunnel ] .",
    "in this section we will discuss the problem of a single particle on the ring , both semiclassically and quantum - mechanically .",
    "the results can support the understanding of the next section , which is devoted to the many - particle situation .",
    "consider two wave packets traversing the left and right arm of the aharonov - bohm ring with constant velocity @xmath28 and meeting again after some time @xmath29 at the opposite end .",
    "the resulting interference pattern depends on the total phase difference between the two paths . in a semiclassical calculation ,",
    "the phase difference is produced by the @xmath30-term in the lagrangian of the particle , and it is given by    @xmath31    the factor @xmath32 arises because the phases are equal up to a change in sign .",
    "@xmath33 gives the time - dependence of the fluctuating vector potential which is assumed to be a classical gaussian random process with zero mean in the high - temperature limit considered here .",
    "the visibility of the interference pattern will be suppressed due to the fluctuations in the phase @xmath34 .",
    "since @xmath34 is a gaussian random variable , we obtain for the suppression factor    @xmath35    in our model @xmath36 is equal to @xmath37 , where we will treat @xmath38 as a classical fluctuating field by taking into account only the real ( symmetric ) part of the correlator ( [ phicorrmark ] ) in the high - temperature limit . then the variance @xmath39 of the phase becomes :    @xmath40    if the traversal time @xmath41 is much larger than the correlation time of the fluctuations in @xmath38 , we may apply the following standard approximation :    @xmath42    this means that in the case of nyquist noise ( @xmath43 ) we obtain a finite `` dephasing rate '' that grows linearly with temperature .",
    "note however , that the time @xmath41 introduced here can not grow without bounds but is fixed by the circumference @xmath4 and the velocity @xmath28 .",
    "this calculation already shows that the dephasing rate will vanish for @xmath44 or @xmath45 . for a bath that is weaker at low frequencies ( @xmath46 with @xmath47 )",
    "we do not obtain a suppression factor that decays exponentially with time , hence the dephasing rate is always zero .",
    "we defer a more detailed discussion of the various cases to the full quantum - mechanical treatment below .",
    "the physical interpretation of this result is clear : the fluctuating electric field @xmath48 leads to a fluctuating velocity @xmath49 , so that the random shift in the interference pattern is @xmath50 .",
    "the interference pattern will be completely washed out once the spread in @xmath51 becomes comparable to the wavelength @xmath52 .",
    "this coincides with the criterion @xmath53 .",
    "very similar considerations arise in the calculation of the green s function of a single electron on the ring .",

    "the extension to the many - particle case will be given in the next section .",
    "the single - particle density of states ( dos ) , which is given by the imaginary part of the fourier transform of @xmath58 , is a measurable quantity , as it can be revealed by tunneling into the ring .",
    "we imagine a situation where the ring is empty and a single electron is inserted , so that the retarded green s function is    @xmath59    the average is a thermal expectation value with respect to the unperturbed bath of oscillators , corresponding to the situation without any particle on the ring . obviously the bath can not change the occupation of the different momentum states .",
    "therefore , we only have to take into account that the time evolution between creation and destruction of the electron is governed by the hamiltonian which contains the kinetic energy term that couples to the bath via the flux @xmath9 . through this coupling",

    "we have introduced the interaction picture with respect to @xmath1 and dropped the term quadratic in @xmath8 from the kinetic energy ( compare the discussion above ) .",

    "physically , this means that at short times the particle has not yet influenced the bath and its energy is still given by the bare energy @xmath74 . at later times , the bath oscillators have been shifted by the presence of the particle , so the overlap between initial and final bath state is diminished and the green s function decays .",

    "apart from these differences , we can use our understanding of the electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations to discuss the effects of the nyquist bath in a qualitative manner .",
    "in particular , free ballistic motion is not affected , since the radiation reaction force only acts on an accelerated charge .",

    "the fact that , at @xmath166 , the decay of the visibility proceeds as a power - law can be understood most easily from the results of an old semiclassical analysis of the lamb - shift due to welton @xcite : the vacuum fluctuations of the electric field lead to a jitter of the electron position , such that the variance @xmath171 of its coordinate is given by the logarithm containing the ratio of an upper cutoff - frequency ( there taken to be the compton frequency ) and a lower cutoff ( the characteristic frequency of electron motion around the nucleus ) . in our case ,",

    "this leads to complete decay of the interference pattern even at @xmath166 .",
    "note , however , that here we have been considering a superposition of excited states of the system and the decay of its coherences .",
    "in other problems of dephasing , such as those encountered in weak localization , one usually discusses the limit of zero - frequency response of the system to a small perturbation .",
    "a situation which comes closer to this kind of question will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the goal of the present work has been to analyze thoroughly a model situation which shows some of the features important for dephasing at low temperatures , not to propose some experimental measurement setup .",
    "still , we will now briefly discuss the expected magnitude of the effect due to nyquist noise in an external current coil .",
    "if the equilibrium current fluctuations are produced by an external coil whose circumference is similar to that of the aharonov - bohm ring ( @xmath177 ) and which is placed about a distance @xmath177 away , the dephasing rate is estimated to be    @xmath178    here @xmath179 is the fermi velocity on the ring , @xmath180 is the resistance of the external coil and @xmath181 is the quantum of resistance .",
    "both the square of the fine - structure constant in front of the expression and the ratio of the fermi velocity to the speed of light render the effect very small under reasonable experimental conditions .",
    "note that the fluctuations of the vacuum _",
    "magnetic _ field have a weaker power - spectrum , which leads to @xmath182 at @xmath166 , instead of @xmath183 .",
    "the vacuum fluctuations of the _ electric _ field , however , do lead to a linear spectrum in the vector potential fluctuations ( see discussion above ) . on the other hand , the electric field ( at large wavelengths )",
    "is homogeneous only in free space , not with respect to its projection onto the ring , where it has a position dependence @xmath184 .",
    "thus , the coupling is not diagonal in the momentum basis and is not included in our model .",
    "if one estimates the order of magnitude of the corresponding dephasing rate ( inelastic transition rate ) , one arrives at @xmath185 .",
    "similarly , one may estimate the strength of fluctuations due to shot - noise of the external current .",
    "in a situation where the external coil producing a static magnetic flux on the order of @xmath186 is identical with that where the nyquist noise originates , this leads to an effective dephasing rate of @xmath187 , which may be much larger than that due to the nyquist noise .",
    "note that shot noise can not be described by our model , since it is a nonequilibrium phenomenon and can not be represented by the usual bath of harmonic oscillators at low temperatures .",
    "however , the effects of shot noise would be reduced in a different geometry where a larger current ( with correspondingly smaller _ relative _ magnitude of the shot noise ) produces the same static magnetic flux through the aharonov - bohm ring .      in all of the preceding calculations ,",
    "we have neglected the term @xmath109 which appears in the kinetic energy of the particle but does not couple to the momentum .",
    "this approximation has been necessary to use the well - known formula @xmath188 for a gaussian random variable @xmath189 in the classical case or the analogous expression derived from wick s theorem in the quantum case .",
    "@xmath190 is quadratic in the coordinates of the bath oscillators , whereas @xmath9 is a linear bosonic variable ( gaussian random variable in the classical case ) .",
    "if the term @xmath191 is kept in the hamiltonian , the eigenfrequencies and normal coordinates of the bath of harmonic oscillators are changed by an amount that depends on @xmath14 but not on the particle momentum @xmath3 .",

    "( [ effectivemass ] ) .",
    "note that this difference persists also in the thermodynamic limit @xmath194 .",
    "however , the qualitative behaviour of the bath spectrum at low frequencies is not changed for the spectra @xmath195 with @xmath196 that have been considered here . therefore , this term is unimportant for the qualitative conclusions about dephasing , although it can change quantitative results for larger @xmath14 and does change the single - particle green s function .",
    "the latter involves a change in particle number , so that an additional @xmath190 is introduced into the hamiltonian .",
    "in the following , we will discuss the influence of the bath on the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect , i.e. on the flux - dependence of the transport current through the ring .",

    "a tunneling situation is the appropriate one for our model , since attaching current leads would severely alter the system .",
    "note that independent ( sequential ) tunneling only probes the density of states at the two contacts .",
    "therefore , in order to observe the ab interference effect , we have to consider a coulomb blockade situation , in which any electron tunneling into ( or out of ) the ring will enhance the total energy by the charging energy of the ring which is much larger than the bias voltage @xmath197 and the temperature @xmath151 .",
    "in such a case , transport through the ring is possible only via cotunneling@xcite , i.e. a two - step process involving a virtual intermediate state belonging to a different number of electrons on the ring .",
    "a strong dependence of the tunneling current on the external magnetic flux , with a complete suppression at @xmath198 due to destructive interference , is visible only in the `` elastic cotunneling '' contribution , where the electronic state of the ring is left unaltered in the process .",
    "it is linear in the bias voltage and will dominate the inelastic contribution at low temperatures and for small bias voltages ( see the discussion at the end of this section and ref .  ) .",
    "now consider cotunneling at @xmath166 under the influence of the bath .",
    "the semiclassical analysis of aharonov - bohm interference given in a preceding section is not applicable for @xmath199 , since it assumes the electron can emit or absorb an arbitrary amount of energy . in the quantum - mechanical calculation , suppression of interference is due to the electron leaving a trace in the bath that permits , at least in principle , to decide which of the two arms of the ring the electron has traveled .",
    "this involves a transfer of energy between electron and bath .",
    "the bath spectrum determines the amount of bath oscillators able to absorb the small energy @xmath200 which can be emitted by the electron .",
    "therefore , it is to be expected that dephasing at zero temperature is suppressed for @xmath199 due to the energy conservation constraint .",
    "this will be confirmed by the calculation described in the following , although there are renormalization effects that change the strength of the tunneling current away from the point of perfect destructive interference , @xmath201 .",
    "the tunneling process starts from a situation in which the ring is occupied by the equilibrium number of electrons ( depending on the value of a gate voltage ) and the fermi seas in the left and right electrode are filled up to fermi energies that differ by the bias voltage , @xmath202 , see fig .",

    "the intermediate state is characterized by an extra electron ( or extra hole ) present on the ring and some arbitrary state of the bath . using standard second - order fermi s golden rule ,",
    "the tunneling rate is obtained by summing over all intermediate states ( dividing by the proper energy denominator ) and all final states whose energy equals the initial energy :    @xmath204    here @xmath205 is the sum of the tunneling hamiltonians belonging to the left and the right junction , while the energies and eigenstates refer to the unperturbed hamiltonian that includes everything besides tunneling .",
    "in particular , it includes the coupling between electrons and the bath , as well as the kinetic energies of electrons in the electrodes .    at this point we would like to emphasize",
    "that using fermi s golden rule for the calculation of the cotunneling current does not in itself mean taking into account the interaction between bath and system only in a perturbative way .",

    "is roughly comparable to using the kubo formula in a linear - response calculation of , e.  g. , the weak - localization magnetoconductance , which does not automatically imply a perturbative description of the dephasing processes either .",
    "still , there is an important difference : in our context , we essentially deal with a scattering situation , such that energy conservation holds at least for the initial and final states of the complete process .",
    "this will be seen to be important for our conclusions about the strength ( or absence of ) dephasing .",

    "this difference is due to the fact , that in our problem the energy conservation constraint must be taken care of , since the electron can not transfer an arbitrary amount of energy to the bath .",

    "the resulting exponential couples the momenta @xmath248 and @xmath249 and may therefore lead to dephasing .    from now on",
    ", we again consider baths which are characterized by a power - law spectrum at low frequencies , @xmath195 with an exponent @xmath196 .",
    "remember that the case @xmath265 represents fluctuations of the magnetic flux produced by nyquist noise of an external current loop .",
    "for these bath spectra , it is sufficient to carry out an expansion of the cotunneling rate to leading order in the coupling strength @xmath14 .",

    "however , it is to be evaluated taking into account _ only the fluctuations up to the frequency corresponding to the bias voltage _ and using a weight factor @xmath269 which favors low - energy transfers @xmath27 .",
    "we have already pointed out that the cutoff at @xmath202 is a simple consequence of energy conservation . for a power - law bath spectrum @xmath195 , the integral yields a voltage dependence @xmath270 , so the incoherent tunneling current goes like @xmath271 .",

    "( we remark again that the incoherent current due to external nyquist noise would be too small to be actually measurable under reasonable experimental conditions , compare the discussion at the end of section [ discussdephasing ] ) .",
    "thus , we see that suppression of destructive interference does not show up in the _ linear _ conductance . in this sense",
    ", the fluctuations do not lead to dephasing in the linear transport regime at zero temperature . for the nyquist case @xmath265 , the exponent of @xmath197 is the same as that for inelastic electronic cotunneling processes in a system with a _",

    "bath spectra with @xmath47 obviously lead to an even weaker decrease in the visibility of the interference minimum at low bias voltages .",
    "note that formally inserting @xmath273 in @xmath228 would lead to an incoherent contribution to the linear conductance even at @xmath166 .",
    "however , this case is not of interest here , since it can not be produced by a fluctuating magnetic flux and it is not covered by the approximations made in our calculation ( in particular dropping the @xmath190-term ) .",
    "it would correspond to the strong force fluctuations of an ohmic caldeira - leggett bath used in the description of quantum brownian motion .    for bias voltages",
    "@xmath202 smaller than the single - particle energy spacing @xmath274 on the ring , dephasing is merely due to the coupling to the fluctuating flux . at higher voltages ,",
    "the inelastic cotunneling processes become important . in these , one electron tunnels into the ring , while _ another _ electron goes out at the opposite electrode , thus leaving behind a particle - hole excitation on the ring @xcite .",
    "since all the corresponding final states are different , their contributions to the cotunneling current sum up incoherently .",
    "therefore , like dephasing produced by the bath , they also lead to a nonvanishing contribution to the tunneling current at @xmath198 , where , ideally , one should have perfect destructive interference .",
    "the number of possibilities to create a particle - hole excitation with an energy of at most @xmath202 is @xmath275 , if we assume @xmath276 . in that regime ,",
    "the ratio of the incoherent current contribution due to the external bath to the electronic inelastic contribution is given by the bracket in ( [ ratio ] ) , multiplied by @xmath277 . the electronic inelastic contribution will be the dominant one .    finally , let us discuss finite temperatures .",
    "_ without _ the bath and as long as @xmath278 , only the fermi distributions in the electrodes get smeared , which does not affect the tunneling current , if one takes into account that now the tunneling processes do not only lead to an electron transport from left to right but in the other direction as well .",
    "the presence of the bath will introduce some temperature dependence for the incoherent current contribution in this regime , since at finite temperatures the tunneling electron can not only emit an energy quantum into the bath but also absorb a thermal bath excitation .",
    "therefore , the energy @xmath27 transferred to the bath now can be negative as well .",
    "there is no restriction on the amount of energy an electron can absorb , so there is no cutoff @xmath202 for negative @xmath27 . at positive energy transfers , the probability of spontaneous emission into the bath ( @xmath279 in eq .",
    "( [ ratio ] ) ) now has to be multiplied by @xmath280 , where @xmath23 is the bose distribution function ( induced emission ) . at negative @xmath27 ,",
    "this is replaced by @xmath281 , since only absorption of _ thermal _ excitations ( not of vacuum fluctuations ) is possible .",
    "taking into account the thermal smearing of the electrode fermi distributions , the balance of left and right - going tunneling currents and the induced emission / absorption mentioned just before , we have to perform the following replacements in ( [ ratio ] ) :    @xmath282    note that the factor multiplying @xmath283 in the integral corresponds directly to the function @xmath238 which occurs in the theory of tunneling in a dissipative environment@xcite .",
    "the function @xmath284 itself represents an integral over the average of energies in the left and right electrodes , @xmath285 , at a fixed energy transfer @xmath286 :    @xmath287    here @xmath288 and @xmath289 are the fermi distributions in the two electrodes .",
    "the factor of @xmath290 is due to the fact that for an electron going from right to left the energy transferred to the bath is @xmath291 , so the ratio between the values of @xmath292 at positive and negative frequencies appears , which is just this factor .",
    "note that , in the low - temperature limit ( @xmath293 ) , the function @xmath284 becomes @xmath269 for @xmath294 and vanishes for @xmath295 .",
    "this reproduces the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ finitetemp ] ) as a special case .    using this formula ,",
    "the incoherent tunneling current is found to be enhanced by a temperature - dependent contribution @xmath296 .    at @xmath297",
    ", one would have to take into account the thermal averaging over different electronic configurations on the ring ( still at a fixed particle number determined by charging energy and gate voltage ) .",
    "the perfect destructive interference at @xmath198 depends on the presence of an electronic configuration which is symmetric in the occupancy of equal - energy states having @xmath298 and @xmath299 ( see discussion above ) .",
    "the thermal average includes other configurations as well and therefore leads to a suppression of the destructive interference in the _ elastic _ tunneling current , even without the bath .",
    "furthermore , the electronic _ inelastic _ contribution is also enhanced at finite temperatures and becomes linear in the voltage @xcite .",
    "since we do not find dephasing in our model at zero temperature ( under the circumstances specified above ) , the reader may wonder how our result is related to some apparently contradicting conclusions in the literature .",
    "first of all , we would like to point out that a comparison between findings in different physical situations is not straightforward , since there is no general definition of a `` dephasing rate '' .",
    "e.g. , in recent work on an aharonov - bohm ring containing a quantum dot capacitively coupled to the ohmic fluctuations in a gate@xcite , the authors found that the coupling suppresses the magnitude of the persistent current flowing in the ring and induces fluctuations of this current .",
    "the effect persists even at @xmath300 and was interpreted as dephasing at zero temperature .",
    "formally , the coupling assumed in the setup of ref .",
    "is nondiagonal in the system s eigenbasis , whereas it is diagonal in our case .",
    "this may indeed lead to a weaker tendency towards dephasing in our model ( see the discussion at the end of section [ modelsec ] ) .",
    "still , we also find both a reduction of the persistent current ( subsection [ partsumsec ] ) and fluctuations ( caused by the vector potential fluctuations , since the momentum is conserved ) , regardless of the details of the bath spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , this apparently does not imply dephasing in our interference setup ( cotunneling transport situation ) , which has been our main concern here and which has no analogy in the work of ref .  .",
    "the transport effect depends in an essential way on the long - time dynamics of the system and , therefore , on the low - frequency behaviour of the bath spectrum ( similarly to the caldeira - leggett model or some aspects of the spin - boson model ) , while the reduction of the persistent current does not .",
    "therefore , we have not interpreted the reduction of the persistent current in terms of zero - temperature dephasing , although it certainly constitutes a suppression of an interference - related phenomenon .",
    "we believe that the suppression of interference in a cotunneling setup considered here may be more directly related to mesoscopic transport interference experiments .",
    "our model is certainly quite removed from the discussions about low - temperature dephasing in weak localization .",
    "there , dephasing by electron - electron interaction in an extended disordered system weakens the coherent backscattering effect , which is an interference phenomenon that is robust against both thermal and impurity averaging , in contrast to the destructive interference considered in our model .",
    "since the electrons inside the metal interact all the time , it is not obvious whether that situation is in any way analogous to the kind of `` scattering '' situation considered here for the cotunneling transport .",
    "we have analyzed a simple model of a fluctuating magnetic flux threading an aharonov - bohm ring and discussed its effects on equilibrium properties , such as persistent current and tunneling density of states , as well as transport properties such as the two - particle green s function and the cotunneling current through the ring .",
    "particular emphasis has been put on the question of dephasing and low - temperature behaviour .",
    "there are important qualitative differences depending on the low - frequency behaviour of the bath power spectrum . for the case of nyquist noise and an arbitrary initial superposition of momentum states ,",
    "an exponential decay of off - diagonal elements of the density - matrix in time at @xmath301 goes over into `` power - law dephasing '' at zero temperature .",
    "however , if one probes the coherence properties of the electronic motion on the ring by checking for the possible suppression of destructive ab - interference in a cotunneling setup , no such suppression is found in the _ linear _ transport regime at @xmath166 .",
    "this is because the possibility for the electron to leave a trace in the bath is diminished due to the energy conservation constraint .",
    "our calculation serves as an illustrative example of the difference between the `` optics '' type of interference experiments ( employing _ single _",
    "particles ) , in which the semiclassical approximation and/or the usual feynman - vernon influence functional may be applied to discuss dephasing , and the linear - transport interference experiments encountered in mesoscopic physics , in which special care has to be taken in the analysis of dephasing at low temperatures .",
    "we would like to acknowledge valuable discussions with m.  bttiker , y.  imry , g .-",
    "ingold , a.  j.  leggett , d.  loss , yu .",
    "v. nazarov , a.  rosch , e.  sukhorukov , a.  zaikin and w.  zwerger .",
    "our work is supported by the swiss nsf .",
    "the influence functional for a system ( variable @xmath302 ) coupled linearly to a linear bath ( @xmath9 ) is usually derived in the path - integral picture , by `` integrating out '' the bath variables @xcite .",
    "this can be done because the bath consists of a set of uncoupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "however , the calculation is usually quite cumbersome , although the result is simple enough and involves only the real and imaginary parts of the bath correlator @xmath303 . here",
    "we present a derivation based on keldysh time - ordering and wick s theorem .",
    "the oscillators of the bath and their action for an external driving force never have to be considered and therefore this is probably the shortest route to the well - known caldeira - leggett influence functional .",
    "modifications of this approach are applicable in more complicated situations as well ( compare the main text ) .",
    "the feynman - vernon influence functional is the overlap between the two bath states which result from the action of two different ( fixed ) system trajectories @xmath304 and @xmath305 onto the same initial bath state @xmath306 .",
    "a thermal average over @xmath306 has to be performed at finite temperatures :      here the time - evolution operators depend on the system trajectory @xmath308 via the interaction term @xmath309 in the hamiltonian . using the interaction picture with respect to the bath hamiltonian @xmath310",
    ", we can explicitly write down @xmath311 in the following form , with ( anti-)time - ordering symbols @xmath312 ( @xmath313 ) :          here @xmath317 is equal to @xmath318 ( or @xmath319 ) if @xmath258 lies on the forward ( or backward ) part of the keldysh contour that runs from @xmath158 to @xmath41 and back again .",
    "the advantage of this formal rearrangement is that the application of wick s theorem ( leading to a linked - cluster expansion ) now becomes very simple .",
    "we immediately obtain for @xmath311 :      the brackets @xmath17 denote the thermal average with respect to @xmath310 .",
    "now we can translate back the exponent by taking into account all four possible combinations of the two times on the forward or backward time paths : ( to keep the notation short , we use subscripts for the time arguments )      this can be simplified further by noting that the real part of all the four different correlators appearing here is the same , since it is symmetric in the time arguments : @xmath322 .",
    "therefore , the real part of the exponent is given by :          @xmath325 \\right\\rangle   \\\\",
    "\\im m\\left\\langle \\hat{t}\\hat{\\phi } _ { 1}\\hat{\\phi } _ { 2}\\right\\rangle   & = & sgn(t_{1}-t_{2})\\im m\\left\\langle \\hat{\\phi } _ { 1}\\hat{\\phi } _ { 2}\\right\\rangle = -\\im m\\left\\langle \\widetilde{\\hat{t}}\\hat{\\phi } _ { 1}\\hat{\\phi } _",

    "then we obtain for the imaginary part of the exponent :      this defines the real part of the influence action and describes friction and renormalization effects ( e.g. effective mass ) .",
    "note that we can bring the real part of the exponent , ( [ abb : influencereal ] ) , to a similar form by cutting off the @xmath330-integral at @xmath329 and dropping the factor @xmath332 in front of the expression , since there the integrand is symmetric in @xmath333 .    in this way we have arrived at the well - known influence functional for a system coupled linearly to a linear bath . as usual",
    ", a coupling of the form @xmath334 just leads to a replacement @xmath335 in the final expression , and something like @xmath336 leads to a sum of the corresponding influence actions , if the @xmath337 are uncorrelated .",
