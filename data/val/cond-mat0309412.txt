    "it orders ferromagnetically @xcite via two consecutive phase transitions at @xmath8 15.5 k and @xmath8 12.5 k , respectively @xcite , the first of which has recently been interpreted as a phase separation between small magnetically ordered regions with mobile charge carriers and large disordered regions with localized magnetic polarons @xcite . a spin - polarized electronic - structure calculation in the local spin - density approximation for exchange and correlation ( lsda ) correctly reproduces the lattice constant , the internal coordinates of the boron atoms and the size of the magnetic moment in the stoichiometric compound @xcite .",
    "it also predicts the system to be a semimetal , with overlapping conduction and valence bands around the x - point of the brillouin zone ( bz ) , in contradiction with the results of a combined study based on angle - resolved photoemission ( arpes ) and bulk - sensitive soft x - ray emission ( sxe ) and absorption ( xas ) spectroscopies @xcite , which suggest a gap of at least 1 ev between the two bands .",
    "while , given the approximation used in the calculation , this discrepancy is not surprising , the fact that conduction band states were observed at all in the photoemission experiment , illustrates the fundamental problem one is faced with when trying to describe the transport properties of this system and of the hexaborides in general , namely that their behaviour is to a large extent determined by defects and impurities @xcite .    in this paper , we offer a quantitative analysis of magnetization , magnetoresistance and hall effect data , obtained on one and the same sample , using a plausible model for the origin of the mobile charge carriers and a consistent description of the dependence of their concentration and their scattering rate on the applied magnetic field and on temperature .",

    "the exchange coupling between the conduction electrons and the localized ( spin- ) magnetic moments of the eu - ions leads to a lowering of the conduction band edge above t@xmath9 and to a splitting of the spin - up and spin - down bands below t@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is also responsible for the so - called spin - disorder resistivity @xcite which , in a semiconductor , is strongly dependent on the degree of spin - polarisation of the conduction electrons and on the concommitant redistribution of the charge carriers between the spin - up and spin - down bands @xcite .",
    "we have attempted to model our data on the anomalous hall effect with the mechanism suggested by kondo @xcite for the case of gadolinium metal , where the trivalent gd ions adopt the same 4f@xmath10 configuration as eu@xmath1 in eub@xmath0 .",

    "enhancing the applied field from 0 to 5.5 t induces a monotonous enhancement of the ordered eu moment and thus the magnetization .",
    "this in turn enhances the overlap between the valence band and the conduction as well as the donor spin - up bands , leading to a net increase in the density of mobile charge carriers . from the fit of our experimental data to eqs .",

    "below 5 k the elementary excitations of the system of magnetic eu ions are spin - waves @xcite . from a comparison of the zero - field resistivities at 2 and 4",
    "k we see that the scattering of the charge carriers by these collective modes , which should be proportional to @xmath213 , can be neglected .",

    "in this paper we offer a consistent , quantitative description of the magnetoresistance and the hall effect in eub@xmath0 over a wide range of temperatures above and below the magnetic phase transition . from our analysis ,",
    "the following picture of the electronic structure of this compound emerges . for @xmath128 @xmath192 20 k and no applied magnetic field ,",
    "eub@xmath0 is a heavily ( self- ) doped , strongly compensated n - type semiconductor .",
    "the donors are b@xmath0 vacancies , whose energy levels form a narrow `` band '' centered above the chemical potential , and possibly trivalent impurities , which we have neglected .",
    "the acceptors are cation vacancies , always present in the hexaborides , whose energy levels also form a narrow `` band '' just above the top of the valence band ( fig . [ bandstructure ]",

    "the intrinsic band gap is of the order of 14 mev and the chemical potential lies @xmath8 66 mev above the bottom of the conduction band . upon application of a magnetic field ,",
    "the eu - ions acquire a net moment in the field direction .",
    "the latter couples to the conduction electrons through the exchange hamiltonian @xmath216 , leading to a splitting of the conduction band proportional to the magnetization in first order .",
    "the acceptor levels , the wave functions of which are mainly composed of d@xmath217 orbitals reaching out from the neighboring cations , suffer a splitting of similar size , while that of the donor levels and especially that of the valence band , which both couple to the eu moments only indirectly through hybridization with the cation s d - orbitals , will be smaller .",
    ", that of the donor levels 50 @xmath133 and that of the valence band 15 @xmath133 of the splitting of the conduction band , respectively . ]",
    "these splittings lead to a redistribution of the charge carriers between the different bands and , in our model , at a temperature dependent critical value of the applied field , e.g. , 1.4 t at 22.5 k , the spin - down conduction band has emptied itself completely . at that point , the magnetization has reached only 25 percent of its saturation value . as the applied field and the magnetization",
    "are further enhanced , the top of the spin - down valence band moves closer to the selfconsistently determined chemical potential ( fig .",
    "( [ bandstructure ] b ) ) , until it crosses it . at 5.5 t ( @xmath218 @xmath166 0.65 ) the situation is that of fig .",
    "( [ bandstructure ] c ) .",
    "once the saturation magnetization has been reached , the carrier densities in the valence and the conduction band stay constant .",
    "this picture is consistent with the observation of two ellipsoidal pockets in de haas van alphen ( dhva ) and shubnikov de haas experiments , performed at fields above 5 t @xcite .",
    "the electrons and holes being in different spin states , their bloch functions can not mix .",
    "it also offers a natural explanation for the weak temperature dependence of the dhva frequencies , even accross @xmath5 @xcite , since these are only affected by deviations of the 4f - electron based magnetization from its saturation value . in view of the sensitivity of the system to defects ,",
    "our carrier concentrations are in very reasonable agreement with the ones quoted in refs . @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a further test of our interpretation is provided by the reflectivity experiments of degiorgi and collaborators @xcite . in fig .",

    "our results compare well with the data of ref .",
    "in particular , we reproduce , even quantitatively , the steep rise of @xmath222 below @xmath5 .",

    "finally we compare our model with the arpes and bulk - sensitive xas and sxe data of ref .",
    "@xcite , which were obtained in the temperature range between 20 and 30 k. the existence of an x - point electron pocket was assumed a priori in our theoretical ansatz , relying on the validity of these experimental results .",
    "the authors of ref . @xcite attribute the feature labelled `` band 1 '' in their paper to the emission from the valence band .",
    "the fact that its dispersion is much weaker in eub@xmath0 than in cab@xmath0 and srb@xmath0 , and the value of its binding energy of @xmath8 1.2 ev , lead us to interpret it as an emission from the eu 4f - shell . according to our model ,",
    "the emission from the valence band should start at a binding energy of @xmath8 0.1 ev , which is not seen in arpes .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the exposed @xmath225100@xmath226 $ ] face consists of metal atoms only and that the electrons , originating from the boron network , can not escape from the solid at the given photon energies .",
    "another complication is the observed time - dependent surface relaxation @xcite .",
    "the sxe and xas data are consistent with our interpretation of the arpes data .",
    "although `` real '' eub@xmath0 is a heavily doped , strongly compensated , and therefore very disordered magnetic semiconductor , many of its properties can be satisfactorily described by a relatively simple model , taking into account the two main intrinsic sources of imperfections , namely eu and b@xmath0 vacancies .",
    "our microscopic treatment above @xmath5 is limited to the range of temperatures where mean field theory can be used to describe the magnetic properties of the compound .",
    "we expect the behavior around @xmath5 ( and the critical temperature itself ) to be sample dependent , as the ( rkky ) coupling between magnetic ions is mediated by the conduction electrons whose concentration is a function of the magnetization .",
    "what is still missing is a plausible mechanism leading to the correct order of magnitude for the anomalous hall resistivity in this and the other compounds formed by rare - earth ions with a half - filled 4f shell . in our opinion the order of magnitude discrepancy between theory and experiment with respect to the anomalous hall effect is not caused by underestimating the mixing matrix element @xmath49 , as this would reflect itself in the resistivity as well .",
    "it must therefore be connected with the multiplicity of the intermediate states which can be coupled by the spin - orbit interaction . the lowest energy term for the 4f@xmath48 configuration",
    "is characterized by @xmath227 = 3 and @xmath91 = 3 , with a degeneracy of 49 in the absence of spin - orbit coupling . whereas the unit operator , relevant for the resistivity , only has diagonal matrix elements , the spin - orbit operator , which splits the term into seven multiplet levels @xmath75 = 0 , 1 , ... 6 , has matrix elements between states satisfying the selection rule @xmath228 = 0 , @xmath1791 , within every subspace corresponding to a given value of @xmath75 .",
    "this leads to 133 possible transitions instead of 49 , still not enough to account for the observed difference .",
    "we conjecture that the small hybridization between the europium ( gadolinium ) 4f orbitals and the boron sp @xcite ( gadolinium 5p @xcite ) orbitals , suggested but overestimated by band structure calculations , opens the necessary extra channels .",
    "we hope that our results , which confirm previously established discrepancies , will encourage more theoretical work on this long standing problem .",
