    "many - body methods have proven to be a highly accurate tool for determination of atomic properties , especially for systems with one valence electron outside a closed - shell core  @xcite . for alkali - metal atoms a comparison of highly - accurate experimental data with calculations",
    "@xcite allows one to draw a conclusion that modern _ ab initio _ methods are capable of predicting basic properties of low - lying states with a precision better than 1% .    for _ divalent",
    "_ atoms such a comprehensive comparison was previously hindered by a lack of high - precision measurements of radiative lifetimes . despite the lifetimes of the lowest @xmath5 and @xmath6 states",
    "were repeatedly obtained both experimentally and theoretically @xcite , persistent discrepancies remain . only very recently ,",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have achieved 0.4% accuracy for the rate of @xmath7 transition in calcium .",
    "this high - precision value was deduced from photoassociation spectroscopy of ultracold calcium atoms .",
    "one of the purposes of the present work is to test the quality of many - body techniques for two - valence electron systems by comparing our result with the experimental value from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we extend the earlier work  @xcite and report results of relativistic many - body calculation of energy levels and electric - dipole transition amplitudes for mg , ca and sr .",
    "the calculations are performed in the framework of configuration - interaction approach coupled with many - body perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "we tabulate electric - dipole amplitudes for @xmath0 , for @xmath1 , and for @xmath2 transitions and estimate theoretical uncertainties .    cooling and trapping experiments with alkaline - earth atoms",
    "were recently reported for mg  @xcite , ca  @xcite , and sr  @xcite .",
    "the prospects of achieving bose - einstein condensation were also discussed  @xcite .",
    "our accurate transition amplitudes will be helpful in designs of cooling schemes and atomic clocks .",
    "in addition , these amplitudes will aid in determination of long - range atomic interactions , required in calculation of scattering lengths and interpretation of cold - collision data .",
    "for example , dispersion ( van der waals ) coefficient @xmath8 characterizes the leading dipole - dipole interaction of two ground - state atoms at large internuclear separations  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath8 is expressed in terms of energy separations and electric - dipole matrix elements between the ground and excited atomic states .",
    "approximately 80% of the total value of @xmath8 arises from the principal transition @xmath9 , requiring accurate predictions for the relevant matrix element .",
    "therefore our results will be also useful in determination of dispersion coefficients .",
    "in atomic - structure calculations , correlations are conventionally separated into three classes : valence - valence , core - valence , and core - core correlations .",
    "a strong repulsion of valence electrons has to be treated non - perturbatively , while it is impractical to handle the two other classes of correlations with non - perturbative techniques , such as configuration - interaction ( ci ) method .",
    "therefore , it is natural to combine many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) with one of the non - perturbative methods .",
    "it was suggested @xcite to use mbpt to construct an effective hamiltonian @xmath10 defined in the model space of valence electrons .",
    "energies and wavefunctions of low - lying states are subsequently determined using ci approach , i.e. diagonalizing @xmath10 in the valence subspace .",
    "atomic observables are calculated with effective operators  @xcite .",
    "following the earlier work , we refer to this method as ci+mbpt formalism .    in the ci+mbpt approach",
    "the energies and wavefunctions are determined from the schrdinger equation @xmath11 where the effective hamiltonian is defined as @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the two - electron hamiltonian in the frozen core approximation and @xmath14 is the energy - dependent correction , involving core excitations .",
    "the operator @xmath14 completely accounts for the second order of perturbation theory .",
    "determination of the second order corrections requires calculation of one and two  electron diagrams .",
    "electron diagrams describe an attraction of a valence electron by a ( self-)induced core polarization .",
    "the two - electron diagrams are specific for atoms with several valence electrons and represent an interaction of a valence electron with core polarization induced by another valence electron .    already at the second order the number of the two ",
    "electron diagrams is large and their computation is very time - consuming . in the higher orders the calculation of two - electron diagrams becomes impractical .",
    "therefore we account for the higher orders of mbpt indirectly .",
    "it was demonstrated  @xcite that a proper approximation for the effective hamiltonian can substantially improve an agreement between calculated and experimental spectra of multielectron atom .",
    "one can introduce an energy shift @xmath15 and replace @xmath16 in the effective hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eqn_heff ] ) .",
    "the choice @xmath15=0 corresponds to the brillouin - wigner variant of mbpt and the rayleigh - schrdinger variant is recovered setting @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the zero - order energy of level @xmath19 .",
    "the latter is more adequate for multielectron systems  @xcite ; for few - electron systems an intermediate value of @xmath15 is optimal .",
    "we have determined @xmath15 from a fit of theoretical energy levels to experimental spectrum .",
    "such an optimized effective hamiltonian was used in calculations of transition amplitudes .    to obtain an effective electric - dipole operator we solved random - phase approximation ( rpa ) equations , thus summing a certain sequence of many - body diagrams to all orders of mbpt .",
    "the rpa describes a shielding of externally applied field by core electrons .",
    "we further incorporated one- and two - electron corrections to the rpa to account for a difference between the v@xmath20 and v@xmath21 potentials and for the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "in addition , the effective operator included corrections for normalization and structural radiation  @xcite .",
    "the rpa equations depend on transition frequency and should be solved independently for each transition .",
    "however , the frequency dependence was found to be rather weak and we solved these equations only at some characteristic frequencies . to monitor a consistency of the calculations we employed both length ( l ) and velocity ( v ) gauges for the electric - dipole operator .",
    "the computational procedure is similar to calculations of hyperfine structure constants and electric - dipole amplitudes for atomic ytterbium @xcite .",
    "we consider mg , ca and sr as atoms with two valence electrons above closed cores [ 1@xmath22, ... ,2@xmath23 , [ 1@xmath22, ... ,3@xmath23 , and [ 1@xmath22, ... ,4@xmath23 , respectively @xcite .",
    "one - electron basis set for mg included 1@xmath2213@xmath22 , 2@xmath2413@xmath24 , 3@xmath2512@xmath25 , and 4@xmath2611@xmath26 orbitals , where the core- and 3,4@xmath22 , 3,4@xmath24 , 3,4@xmath25 , and 4@xmath26 orbitals were dirac - hartree - fock ( dhf ) ones , while all the rest were virtual orbitals .",
    "the orbitals 1@xmath223@xmath22 were constructed by solving the dhf equations in v@xmath20 approximation , 3@xmath24 orbitals were obtained in the v@xmath27 approximation , and 4@xmath22 , 4@xmath24 , 3,4@xmath25 , and 4@xmath26 orbitals were constructed in the v@xmath21 approximation .",
    "we determined virtual orbitals using a recurrent procedure , similar to ref .",
    "@xcite and employed in previous work  @xcite .",
    "the one - electron basis set for ca included 1@xmath2213@xmath22 , 2@xmath2413@xmath24 , 3@xmath2512@xmath25 , and 4@xmath2611@xmath26 orbitals , where the core- and 4@xmath22 , 4@xmath24 , and 3@xmath25 orbitals are dhf ones , while the remaining orbitals are the virtual orbitals .",
    "the orbitals 1@xmath224@xmath22 were constructed by solving the dhf equations in the v@xmath20 approximation , and 4@xmath24 and 3@xmath25 orbitals were obtained in the v@xmath27 approximation .",
    "finally , the one - electron basis set for sr included 1@xmath2214@xmath22 , 2@xmath2414@xmath24 , 3@xmath2513@xmath25 , and 4@xmath2613@xmath26 orbitals , where the core- and 5@xmath22 , 5@xmath24 , and 4@xmath25 orbitals are dhf ones , and all the rest are the virtual orbitals .",
    "the orbitals 1@xmath225@xmath22 were constructed by solving the dhf equations in the v@xmath20 approximation , and 5@xmath24 and 4@xmath25 orbitals were obtained in the v@xmath27 approximation .",
    "configuration - interaction states were formed using these one - particle basis sets .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the employed basis sets were sufficiently large to obtain numerically converged ci results .",
    "a numerical solution of random - phase approximation equations required an increase in the number of virtual orbitals .",
    "such extended basis sets included @xmath28@xmath29 , @xmath30@xmath31 , @xmath32(@xmath33 - 1)@xmath25 , @xmath34(@xmath33 - 4)@xmath26 , and @xmath35(@xmath33 - 8)@xmath36 orbitals , where @xmath33=19,20,21 for mg , ca , and sr , respectively .",
    "excitations from all core shells were included in the rpa setup .",
    "in tables  [ mg_e ]  [ sr_e ] we present calculated energies of low - lying states for mg , ca , and sr and compare them with experimental values .",
    "the two - electron binding energies were obtained both in the framework of conventional configuration - interaction method and using the formalism of ci coupled with many - body perturbation theory . already at the ci stage",
    "the agreement of the calculated and experimental energies is at the level of 5% .",
    "the addition of many - body corrections to the hamiltonian improves the accuracy by approximately an order of magnitude .",
    "finally , with an optimal choice of parameter @xmath15 the agreement with experimental values improves to 0.10.2% .",
    "compared to the binding energies , fine - structure splitting of triplet states and singlet - triplet energy differences represent a more stringent test of our method . for the @xmath37-states",
    "the fine - structure splitting is reproduced with an accuracy of several per cent in the pure ci for all the three atoms , while the @xmath38  @xmath39 energy differences are less accurate ( especially for ca and sr ) . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the two - electron exchange coulomb integral @xmath40 ( @xmath19=3,4,5 for mg , ca , and sr , respectively ) determining the splitting between @xmath38 and @xmath39 states is very sensitive to many - body corrections",
    ". indeed , with these corrections included , the agreement with the experimental data improves to 1 - 2% for all the three atoms .",
    "the case of the even - parity @xmath41-states is even more challenging .",
    "for ca , these four states are practically degenerate at the ci stage . a repulsion of the level @xmath42 from the upper - lying levels of @xmath43 configuration pushes it down to the level @xmath44 and causes their strong mixing . as seen from table  [ ca_e ]",
    "these states are separated only by 10 @xmath45 , while the experimental energy difference is 1550 @xmath45 . as a result ,",
    "an accurate description of superposition of @xmath44 and @xmath42 states is important .",
    "the @xmath44 ",
    "@xmath42 splitting is restored when the many - body corrections are included in the effective hamiltonian",
    ". these corrections properly account for core polarization screening an interaction between @xmath46 and @xmath47 configurations .    for sr ,",
    "the fine - structure splittings of @xmath48 states and energy difference between the @xmath48 and the @xmath42 levels are also strongly underestimated in the pure ci method . again",
    "the inclusion of the many - body corrections substantially improves the splittings between the @xmath49-states .",
    "it is worth emphasizing , that for such an accurate analysis a number of effects was taken into account , i.e. , spin - orbit interaction , configuration interaction , and core - valence correlations .",
    "a proper account for all these effects is of particular importance for determination of electric - dipole amplitudes forbidden in @xmath50-coupling , such as for @xmath51 transitions .      in this section",
    "we present calculations of electric - dipole ( e1 ) amplitudes for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath2 , and @xmath54 transitions .",
    "the calculated reduced matrix elements for mg , ca , and sr are presented in tables  [ tab_e1_allowed ] and [ tab_e1_inter ] . for a transition @xmath55 the einstein rate coefficients for spontaneous emission ( in @xmath56 ) are expressed in terms of these reduced matrix elements @xmath57 ( a.u . ) and wavelengths @xmath58 (  ) as @xmath59 a number of long - range atom - atom interaction coefficients could be directly obtained from the calculated matrix elements . at large internuclear separations",
    "@xmath60 an atom in a state @xmath61 predominantly interacts with a like atom in a state @xmath62 through a potential @xmath63 , provided an electric - dipole transition between the two atomic states @xmath64 and @xmath65 is allowed . the coefficient @xmath66 is given by @xmath67{ccc}% $ j_{a}$ & $ 1 $ & $ j_{b}$\\\\ $ -\\frac{\\omega+\\mu}{2}$ & $ \\mu$ & $ \\frac{\\omega-\\mu}{2}$% \\end{tabular } \\right )   ^{2}% \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the conventionally defined sum of projections of total angular momenta on internuclear axis .    from a solution of the eigen - value problem , eq .",
    "( [ eqn_sh ] ) , we obtained wave functions , constructed effective dipole operators , and determined the transition amplitudes . the calculations were performed within both traditional configuration - interaction method and ci coupled with the many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the comparison of the ci and the ci+mbpt values allows us to estimate an accuracy of our calculations .",
    "as it was mentioned above , to monitor the consistency of the calculations , we determined the amplitudes using both length and velocity gauges for the dipole operator .",
    "in general , dipole amplitudes calculated in the velocity gauge are more sensitive to many - body corrections ; we employ the length form of the dipole operator in our final tabulation .",
    "we start the discussion with the amplitudes for the principal @xmath69 transitions ( @xmath70 for mg , @xmath71 for ca , and @xmath72 for sr ) .",
    "examination of table  [ tab_e1_allowed ] reveals that the many - body effects reduce the l - gauge amplitudes by 1.6% for mg , 5.5% for ca , and 6.4% for sr .",
    "further , the mbpt corrections bring the length and velocity - form results into a closer agreement .",
    "for example , for sr at the ci level the velocity and length forms differ by 2.7% and this discrepancy is reduced to 0.8% in the ci+mbpt calculations .",
    "a dominant theoretical uncertainty of the employed ci+mbpt method is due to impossibility to account for all the orders of many - body perturbation theory .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that in our ci calculations the basis sets were saturated and the associated numerical errors were negligible .",
    "we expect that the theoretical uncertainty is proportional to the determined many - body correction .",
    "in addition , we take into account the proximity of the amplitudes obtained in the l- and v - gauges .",
    "we estimate the uncertainties for the @xmath69 transition amplitudes as 2530% of the many - body corrections in the length gauge .",
    "the final values for @xmath73 with experimental data in table  [ tab_e1_allowed ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig_princ ] .",
    "our estimated accuracy for mg is a factor of three better than that of the most accurate experiment and for sr is comparable to experimental precision . for ca , the dipole matrix element of the @xmath74 was recently determined with a precision of 0.2% by zinner _",
    "_ @xcite using photoassociation spectroscopy of ultracold ca atoms .",
    "while our result is in harmony with their value , the experimental accuracy is substantially better .",
    "an updated analysis  @xcite of photoassociation spectra of ref .",
    "@xcite leads to a somewhat better agreement with our calculated value .",
    "a very extensive compilation of earlier theoretical results for the @xmath75 transition amplitudes can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for mg and in ref .",
    "@xcite for ca . in a very recent multiconfiguration hartree - fock ( mchf )",
    "calculations for mg  @xcite the authors have determined @xmath76 a.u . this value agrees with our final result of 4.03(2 ) a.u . for heavier sr the correlation effects are especially pronounced and only a few calculations were performed .",
    "for example , mchf calculations for sr  @xcite found in the length gauge @xmath77 a.u .",
    "by contrast to the present work , the core - polarization effects were not included in this analysis . as a result , this calculated value is in a good agreement with our result 5.63 a.u .",
    "obtained at the ci stage , but differs from the final value @xmath78 a.u .",
    "another nonrelativistically allowed transition is @xmath79 and one could expect that this amplitude can be determined with a good accuracy . for mg",
    "this is really so .",
    "however , for ca and sr an admixture of the configuration @xmath47 brings about large corrections to this amplitude , especially in the velocity gauge .",
    "another complication is the following .",
    "the matrix element of electric - dipole operator can be represented in the v - gauge as ( atomic units @xmath80 are used ) : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the speed of light , @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the energies of initial and final states , and @xmath85 are the dirac matrices . for the @xmath86 transition in ca and sr",
    "the energy denominator is approximately 0.01 a.u . because the e1-amplitudes of these transitions @xmath87 a.u .",
    "( see table  [ tab_e1_allowed ] ) , the respective numerators are of the order of 0.01 a.u .",
    "correspondingly the matrix elements @xmath88 are small and are very sensitive to corrections , i.e. , the v - gauge results are unstable . as a result we present only the l - gauge values for @xmath89 e1 amplitudes for ca and sr .",
    "an absence of reliable results in v - gauge hampers an estimate of the accuracy , so we rather conservatively take it to be 25% . note that even with such a large uncertainty our value for sr significantly differs from the experimental value @xcite .",
    "the measurement in @xcite has been carried out on the @xmath90 transition and an interference between electric - quadrupole ( e2 ) and stark - induced dipole amplitudes was observed . in order to determine the transition rate",
    "a theoretical value of the e2-amplitude for the @xmath91 transition was taken from @xcite .",
    "it may be beneficial either to measure directly the rate of the e1-transition @xmath79 or to measure the rate of the e2-transition @xmath91 .    for the @xmath92 transitions the respective e1-amplitudes are small ; these are nonrelativistically forbidden intercombination transitions and consequently their amplitudes are proportional to spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the calculated reduced matrix elements are presented in table  [ tab_e1_inter ] .",
    "one can see from tables  [ mg_e ]   [ sr_e ] that the mbpt corrections to the fine structure splittings are large , amplifying significance of higher order many - body corrections .",
    "in addition , higher order corrections in the fine - structure constant @xmath93 to the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian are also important here . as demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , the breit interaction reduces the dipole amplitude of @xmath94 transition in mg by 5% . at the same time for all the intercombination transitions",
    "the agreement between l- and v - gauges is at the level of 6 - 8% .",
    "we conservatively estimate the uncertainties of the calculated intercombination e1 amplitudes to be 1012% .    to reiterate , we carried out calculations of energies of low - lying levels and electric - dipole amplitudes between them for divalent atoms mg , ca , and sr .",
    "we employed _ ab initio _ relativistic configuration interaction method coupled with many - body perturbation theory .",
    "the calculated removal energies reproduce experimental values within 0.1 - 0.2% .",
    "a special emphasis has been put on accurate determination of electric - dipole amplitudes for principal transitions @xmath95 . for these transitions , we estimated theoretical uncertainty to be 0.5% for mg , 1.4% for ca , and 1.7% for sr . for ca ,",
    "the reduced matrix element @xmath96 is in a good agreement with a high - precision experimental value  @xcite .",
    "an estimated uncertainty of the calculated lifetime of the lowest @xmath97 state for mg is a factor of three smaller than that of the most accurate experiment .",
    "in addition , we evaluated electric - dipole amplitudes and estimated theoretical uncertainties for @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and for @xmath100 transitions .",
    "our results could be useful in designs of cooling schemes and atomic clocks , and for accurate description of long - range atom - atom interactions needed in interpretation of cold - collision data .",
