    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are among the most important tools to study the expansion history of the universe and to set constraints on the properties of dark energy ( @xcite ; see @xcite for reviews ) . with the empirical calibration of their peak luminosity @xcite ,",
    "it is feasible to probe the properties of the universe out to a redshift of @xmath0 and higher @xcite .",
    "understanding the formation of the ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum of sne ia is important for two reasons : the optical spectrum is strongly affected by line blocking in the uv , and optical observations of high - redshift supernovae primarily cover the rest - frame uv bands .",
    "comparisons between local and distant sne ia have recently identified the uv as an important region to search for possible effects of evolution @xcite .",
    "efforts have been made to increase the sample of local sne  ia observed in the uv by space - borne telescopes .",
    "the amount of data available for sne  ia in the uv is very small and mostly limited to single epochs ",
    "usually around ( or well after ) maximum light @xcite .",
    "prominent examples include the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ spectra of sn  1992a ( @xmath1d and @xmath2d after @xmath3-band maximum , @xcite ) and the very early _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ spectrum of sn  1990n ( @xmath4d before @xmath3-band maximum , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) onboard the _ swift _ satellite @xcite has also provided valuable uv data on sne  ia @xcite .    to interpret such data correctly , it is necessary to understand the formation of the uv flux in sne  ia and its sensitivity to physical parameters of the explosion and ambient medium .",
    "several groups have studied the properties of the uv flux using radiative transfer models of differing complexity @xcite .    in this paper , we use radiative transfer models to study the properties of sn  2001eh and sn  2001ep , which were observed as part of the supernova intensive study ( sins ; go9114 ; pi r. p. kirshner ) with",
    "_ hst_. based on the spectral models , we investigate how a change of physical parameters may affect the observed uv flux of a sn  ia .",
    "in particular , when using sne  ia as standard candles to measure cosmological parameters , it is important to know if parameters that are likely to change over a large range of redshifts can introduce systematic errors in the distance measurement . among the parameters that may be affected by the environment of sn  ia progenitors is the abundance of heavy elements in the outer shells of the ejecta .",
    "these layers are of particular importance for the formation of the uv spectrum during the photospheric phase .",
    "the two supernovae chosen for this study are at the opposite ends of the luminosity distribution of normal sne  ia .    from spectral analysis of sne  ia , we know that the composition is dominated by a mixture of intermediate - mass elements , such as si , s , and mg , and iron - group elements ( ni , co , and fe ) . at early epochs , until a few weeks after maximum brightness , the spectrum of a sn  ia consists of a number of broad absorption troughs that generally originate from blends of various lines .",
    "( for a review of the observed properties of sne  ia , see @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "the emission of sne  ia is entirely powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath5 created in the explosion .",
    "the @xmath6-ray photons from radioactive decay undergo compton scattering , creating fast electrons which deposit their energy via collisions in the expanding ejecta @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal continuum seen at early epochs around maximum light is formed by the overlap of thousands of weaker lines .",
    "the spectrum peaks at a wavelength between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and drops steeply in the uv , bluewards of the ca h&k lines , which typically have an absorption minimum at about @xmath9 near maximum light @xcite .",
    "the uv wavelength bands of sne  ia comprise only a small fraction of the total emitted light , and are generally characterized by the absence of strong features .",
    "singly and doubly ionized species of heavy elements such as ti , cr , fe , co , and ni have a large number of line transitions in the uv bands that effectively block most of the emission in these bands @xcite . @xcite and @xcite",
    "find that essentially all uv photons created at deeper layers in the ejecta are immediately absorbed and down - scattered to lower energies ( longer wavelengths ) where the line opacity is smaller . the crucial mechanism for the emission of photons in the uv is found to be a reverse - fluorescence process where absorption of red photons is followed by emission in the blue and uv bands @xcite .",
    "these processes have a significantly lower probability of occurrence but in the outer region of the ejecta the emission of bluer photons via reverse fluorescence can be significant because there are many more red photons available than blue ones such that the lines in the blue are not saturated .",
    "blue photons can escape from a line rather than getting re - absorbed locally .",
    "the uv spectrum is predominantly shaped by this fluorescence spectrum originating from a confined layer of high - velocity material , which is small compared to the dimensions of the expanding ejecta @xcite .",
    "the shape of the emission spectrum is determined by the atomic properties of the ions in the emission layer .",
    "this makes the uv an interesting wavelength band in which to study possible progenitor scenarios because the progenitor star may leave a characteristic imprint on the composition of the outermost layers of the expanding shell .",
    "@xcite investigated the dependence of the uv flux of sne  ia on the composition of the outermost layers of the ejecta , adopting different fractions of solar metallicity for the material above @xmath10@xmath11 .",
    "they found that overall the uv flux decreases with increasing metallicity .",
    "they also pointed out , however , that the larger number of strong absorption lines with higher metallicity can cause a back reaction of the blocked radiation field on the temperature and ionization structure ( line blanketing ) , which is difficult to disentangle from the line - blocking effect .",
    "therefore , the uv flux may vary non - linearly with a change of composition .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the sensitivity of the uv spectrum to modifications of the composition in the outer layers .",
    "we also consider variations in the density structure of the underlying explosion model .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : obs ] we present observations of sn  2001ep and sn  2001eh covering the uv wavelength range as an example of sne  ia with different uv properties .",

    "the radiative transfer models for both supernovae are used as a basis for a series of models to study the properties of the uv flux with respect to changes in composition and density structure .",

    "the last two elements do not produce strong visible features in the spectrum , but affect the uv flux because they have a large number of relatively weak lines that densely cover the uv and therefore contribute significantly to the total opacity .",

    "overall , an increase of abundances has a stronger effect than a decrease . this is not surprising , because the abundance of heavy elements was already relatively low in the outer layers of the base models .",
    "the comparison of the three groups of models shows that the relative change of the optical part of the spectrum is small to moderate ; the variation of fe alone has the strongest effect on the optical part especially in the series of spectra based on sn  2001ep ( fig .",

    "the variation of the blue and the uv part of the spectra differs among the different groups of models . in the sn",

    "the region red of this feature , up to @xmath18@xmath27 , shows significantly enhanced flux for higher fe abundance in both cases . in the sn",
    "2001ep series this higher flux level also affects the re - emission peak bluewards of the  h&k feature , which remains mostly unchanged in the sn  2001eh models .",
    "the models where fe is decreased are very close to the base model in both series .",
    "further to the uv , bluewards of @xmath18@xmath28 , the models based on sn  2001eh ( fig .",

    "[ fig : uvseries ] , upper - right panel ) , we observe the trend that models with higher fe abundance have more flux in the uv , although the effect here is also small .",
    "the variation of @xmath5 is visible in a similar region as in the fe models , but with the opposite trend .",
    "models with more @xmath5 have a deeper absorption at @xmath18@xmath29 , which is mostly caused by stronger lines .",

    "overall , the model series for the two base models show similar behaviour , although the absolute numbers are slightly different .",
    "the plots confirm what is visible in the spectra : the increase of fe and ti / cr leads to a higher flux in some passbands , while the modification of @xmath5 has the opposite effect .",
    "the @xmath33 band is almost unaffected by a decrease of heavy - element abundances , while an increase always leads to more flux ( although to a small degree in some cases ) .",
    "the feature that most strongly affects the @xmath33-band is the re - emission peak bluewards of the h&k absorption .",
    "the largest variation is usually seen in the filter centred around @xmath35 ( f185w ) .",
    "the change in the uv flux with varying composition is mediated by two main effects .",

    "resonance scatterings that do not change the wavelength of the package are located on the diagonal .",
    "the data in the upper panel are from the simulation of the base model for sn  2001ep ; the data in the lower panel are from the model with high fe abundance in the outer shells .",
    "both simulations have a similar total number of emerging packets ( @xmath18@xmath38 ) , but the diagrams show only a fraction of this total number because many packets are located on identical positions in the wavelength grid . in the model with higher fe abundance in the outer layers the photons encounter more line events and are therefore more likely to be scattered out of their original wavelength . in the base model @xmath39 of all packets emerging with",
    "@xmath40 encounter their last interaction in a shell with @xmath41@xmath11 ; in the model with high fe abundance this fraction is @xmath42 .",
    "counting all packets emerging from the envelope regardless of wavelength , the fractions of packets encountering the last interaction at @xmath41@xmath11 are @xmath43 ( base model ) and @xmath44 ( fe enhanced ) .",
    "the condition for the reverse fluorescence process to lead to an increase of the uv flux is that the uv lines are saturated such that photons can escape from the lines without being re - absorbed immediately .",
    "part of the uv enhancement seen in the models with increased fe abundance is therefore caused by the presence of a larger number of saturated fe lines in the uv .",
    "the decrease of uv flux in the models with enhanced @xmath5 abundance indicates that the dominating co lines in those models are on average less saturated .",

    "they regard this as an additional thermalization process that is not related to collisional and true continuum processes .",
    "in contrast to real thermalization , however , this equilibrium state does not couple the thermal properties of the gas to the radiation field .",
    "therefore , the emitted spectrum depends only weakly on the temperature of the gas ( as long as the ionization does not change significantly with temperature ) . instead , the spectrum reflects the distribution of line strengths as a function of wavelength",

    "we analysed the spectra of two sne  ia that have spectral coverage in the uv wavelength bands .",
    "although the spectra were taken at very similar epochs , their appearances are different .",
    "the models show that the typical temperatures in the ejecta of sn  2001eh are somewhat higher than in sn  2001ep .",
    "the shape of the spectrum of sn  2001eh is determined by absorptions of doubly ionized species ( and ) while the shape of the spectrum of sn  2001ep is determined by lines of singly ionized iron - group elements ( and ) .",
    "the difference is especially visible in the uv bluewards of h&k .",
    "based on these spectral models we investigated the dependence of the uv flux on the metallicity and the density gradient in the outer layers of the ejecta . in one series of models we varied the abundance of groups of heavy elements",
    "; in another series we modified the density gradient in the outer layers and replaced the adopted explosion model with a power - law density structure that has different power - law indices .",
    "the model series with varying composition shows that under certain conditions the uv flux may actually _ increase _ with increasing abundance of heavy elements while other models show the opposite behaviour . the physical process that dominates the formation of the uv flux in sne  ia is a reverse - fluorescence process in which photons are absorbed at long wavelengths and re - emitted at a shorter wavelength in the blue or uv .",
    "therefore , the shape of the spectrum is determined by the distribution of spectral lines as a function of wavelength .",
    "this distribution varies slightly for different elements , but is very sensitive to different ionization stages .",
    "a temperature change that results in a shift of the ionization balance directly affects the efficiency of line blocking in the uv , which couples back to the temperature .",
    "this feedback results in a non - linear response of the uv flux to changes in the metallicity .",
    "this wavelength region is therefore a valuable probe for the outer regions of explosion models , which do not leave a strong signature at longer wavelengths . to further study this effect quantitatively",
    ", a more realistic treatment of the temperature structure , consistent with the non - lte state of the gas , should be used . in this work",
    "we can only give a qualitative assessment of potential variations .",
    "the density gradient mostly affects the breadth of observed line features .",
    "shallow density gradients increase the velocity region over which a line can efficiently absorb and re - emit photons .",
    "for very shallow density structures the densely clustered lines from fe group elements in the uv cause individual absorption features to merge together resulting in a strong depletion of the flux .",
    "steeper density gradients lead to narrower and more pronounced absorption and re - emission features .",
    "overall , the model series of both supernovae show the same qualitative changes .",
    "the main differences seen in the uv affect the shape and strength of the re - emission peak at @xmath18@xmath27 , blue of h&k .    to conclude , a variation in composition and density of the high - velocity layers of the ejecta , which may be introduced by different progenitor environments or different degrees of mixing in the actual explosion , can have a significant impact on the observed uv flux even at later epochs when the optical spectrum is formed at much deeper layers . depending on the exact physical conditions , a variation of metallicity",
    "can either reduce or increase the uv flux without leaving a strong imprint on the spectrum at longer wavelengths . for a better estimate of the magnitude and the scatter of the variation found in real supernovae , more uv observations of sne  ia , preferably over a range of epochs , are needed . with the upcoming repair of stis and the installation of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on _ hst",
    "_ , it should be possible to obtain additional uv spectra of sne  ia that would be critical for such studies .",
