    "despite recent efforts in simulating lattice qcd with dynamical quarks  @xcite the quenched approximation is still widely used .",
    "while precision tests of qcd through numerical simulations with dynamical quarks are not possible with the present generation of machines , accurate calculations of experimentally known quantities , such as the light hadron spectrum , can be performed using the quenched approximation .",

    "@xcite extrapolations to the continuum limit were performed , thus eliminating the dependence on the lattice spacing  @xmath3 . however , since the leading cutoff effects for wilson fermions are linear in  @xmath3 , it is desirable to corroborate these findings and extend the analysis to weak hadronic matrix elements by performing a similar study using an improved action .    to leading order in @xmath3",

    "our values for the hopping parameter @xmath22 were chosen such that they straddle the region of the strange quark mass .",
    "the simulation parameters for each dataset are compiled in table  [ tab_simpar ] , which also contains the estimates of the spatial extensions for each lattice in physical units .",
    "exceptional configurations which were encountered at @xmath16 for @xmath20 have been removed from the statistical ensemble .",
    "the incidence of those configurations is examined in more detail in subsect .",

    "we found that the details in the evaluation of @xmath27 ( e.g. bare versus boosted perturbation theory ) have little influence on our results .",
    "our quark propagators were calculated using both local and smeared sources and sinks .",
    "the smearing was performed using either the `` fuzzing '' technique described in ref .",
    "@xcite or the jacobi smearing algorithm of ref .",
    "both smearing procedures are gauge invariant .",
    "they also have a number of parameters , which can be tuned in order to optimise the projection on a given hadronic state . for jacobi smearing the projection properties",
    "are controlled by the parameter @xmath31 , which appears in the kernel of the smearing operator , and the number of iterations , @xmath32  @xcite . based on our experience",
    "we always chose  @xmath33 and used @xmath32 to control the smearing radius .",
    "the fuzzing algorithm for hadronic correlators has three tunable parameters , denoted by  @xmath34 and  @xmath35 .",
    "the parameter  @xmath36 is the so - called `` link - staple mixing ratio '' , which appears in the construction of fuzzed spatial links ( at fuzzing level  @xmath37 ) according to  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the projection back into the group manifold of su(3 ) .",
    "the maximum number of fuzzing levels is given by @xmath40 . throughout this work",
    "we have used @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the size of the fuzzed source ( sink ) is then determined by  @xmath35 , which is simply the length of the straight path of fuzzed links emanating from the origin into all ( positive and negative ) spatial directions .",
    "an extensive investigation into the optimal smearing parameters , using the projection on both mesonic and hadronic states , was performed at @xmath16 on @xmath43 for @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "it was found that @xmath45 turned out to be a compromise between good projection properties and acceptable noise levels in all types of correlators .",
    "similarly , the optimal radius for fuzzed sources was determined to be  @xmath46 . for different @xmath47-values the radius  @xmath35",
    "was scaled with the lattice spacing .",
    "the type of smearing and the corresponding values of  @xmath32 or  @xmath35 are listed in table  [ tab_simpar ] for all datasets .",
    "quark propagators computed using smeared or local sources / sinks were combined into hadron correlators .",
    "we always use the generic notation s to denote correlators which have been smeared , regardless of whether fuzzing or jacobi smearing was used to smear the sources and/or sinks . by l",
    "we denote unsmeared ( `` local '' ) sources and sinks .",
    "for instance , meson and baryon correlators which have been smeared at the source but not at the sink are both labelled sl in this notation .",
    "the generalisation to other combinations of source and sink smearing is obvious .    we have computed meson and baryon correlators for degenerate and non - degenerate combinations of quark masses .",
    "meson correlators in the pseudoscalar and vector channels were analysed , as well as spin-1/2 ( octet ) and spin-3/2 ( decuplet ) baryons .",
    "our meson masses were extracted by performing correlated , simultaneous fits to the ( ll , ss ) or ( ll , sl ) combination of correlators . in most cases we used a double - cosh formula to fit the ground state and the first excitation , requiring the masses in the fit formulae to coincide for both the ll and ss ( or sl ) correlators . at @xmath16 on @xmath48",
    "the double - cosh fits turned out to be unstable , so that we resorted to single - cosh fits to either the ss or sl correlator .",
    "for baryons we followed the same strategy , using double - exponential fits , and , at @xmath16 , @xmath48 , a single exponential .",
    "all fitting intervals have been determined by performing a `` sliding window '' analysis , in which we first selected the maximum timeslice , @xmath49 , of the fitting interval ( usually @xmath50 ) and then pushed @xmath51 to its lowest value which was compatible with the requirements of low @xmath52 and overall stability of the fitted masses .",
    "all statistical errors have been estimated using the bootstrap method with 1000 bootstrap samples .",
    "more details about our implementation of the method can be found in @xcite .      it has been noted that calculations of fermionic quantities occasionally suffer from abnormally large fluctuations , in particular for small quark masses  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations have been linked to exceptionally small eigenvalues of the dirac operator , and the gauge configurations on which they occur are usually called `` exceptional configurations '' .",
    "the fraction of such configurations in the total statistical ensemble increases for smaller quark mass @xmath53 and/or larger values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the lattice volume  @xcite .    in our simulations",
    "we have encountered exceptional configurations at @xmath16 , but not at the other two @xmath47-values . in order to compare their incidence for @xmath21 and  @xmath56",
    "we have analysed distributions of observables for @xmath16 on @xmath43 , using the smallest quark mass in the tad and np datasets .",
    "the chosen observable was the unsmeared ( i.e. ll ) pseudoscalar correlator at @xmath57 .    to this end",
    "we have determined the median @xmath58 and the values denoting the upper ( @xmath59 ) and lower ( @xmath60 ) ends of the central 68% . as a measure for the width one can define the ratio @xmath61 the distributions are quite similar for the tad and np datasets .",
    "first , their width is comparable , since @xmath62 in both cases .",
    "second , both distributions extend smoothly out to about @xmath63 .",
    "there are , however , differences in the tails of the distributions , i.e. the number of values encountered far beyond @xmath63 . in the tad dataset only one configuration is encountered , which produces a value at roughly @xmath64 above the median , whereas in the np dataset there are three such configurations with values for the pseudoscalar correlator at 44@xmath65 , 65@xmath65 and  360@xmath65 above @xmath58 .",
    "we draw two conclusions from this analysis .",
    "the fact that the width is comparable ( i.e. the value of @xmath66 ) suggests that the typical statistical fluctuations do not increase significantly as @xmath55 is increased from its tadpole improved perturbative estimate to the non - perturbative value .",
    "second , we have confirmed the increase of the fraction of exceptional configurations ( i.e. those configurations for which the observable shoots up to values which are orders of magnitude above the normal level of fluctuations ) for larger @xmath55 .",
    "the presence of a zero eigenvalue of the dirac operator at a nearby @xmath22-value has also been verified for such configurations  @xcite .",
    "we did not make attempts to treat exceptional configurations using , for instance , the methods described in  @xcite . instead we have chosen to eliminate them from our statistical ensemble .",
    "that is , at @xmath16 , @xmath43 we have removed the two configurations which produced the most extreme values in the distribution of the unsmeared pion propagator for @xmath20 , and on which the inversion of the dirac operator did not converge for some of its components .",
    "the latter also occurred on another configuration if a fuzzed source was used , and that configuration was subsequently removed as well .",
    "the total number of exceptional configurations which were removed for a particular dataset are shown in brackets in table  [ tab_simpar ] .",
    "note that no configurations were eliminated from the tad datasets .",
    "for our range of @xmath47-values and the corresponding values of  @xmath55 the incidence of exceptional configurations is still relatively small .",
    "their fraction in the np dataset amounts to less than 1% on @xmath43 ( 3% on @xmath48 ) , and after the analysis presented here we do not expect serious distortions of the statistical ensembles due to their removal .",
    "in tables[tab_ps_np][tab_vec_tad ] we present our `` raw '' results for meson masses in the pseudoscalar and vector channels , which were obtained from the fits described in the previous section .",
    "the fit ranges were determined independently for the ( ll , sl ) and ( ll , ss ) combinations of correlators .",
    "both combinations gave consistent results , and in general we quote the result from the fit which gave the best value of @xmath67 .    in the pseudoscalar channel",
    "the fits were very stable under variations of the fitting interval .",
    "by contrast , the fits in the vector channel could in some cases differ by up to one standard deviation if a different fitting interval was selected .",
    "we estimate the systematic error in the mass of the vector meson arising from choosing alternative fitting ranges to be at most as large as the statistical error .",
    "this systematic error has not been included in the tables .",
    "based on our results for the np dataset obtained at @xmath16 on @xmath43 and @xmath48 , we can make a first estimate of finite size effects in the mesonic sector . in physical units",
    "the spatial extensions of the two lattices correspond to @xmath68 and  @xmath69 , respectively .    in the pseudoscalar channel we find evidence for small but significant finite volume effects .",
    "on the smaller lattice the values for @xmath70 are consistently larger .",
    "furthermore , the effect shows a trend to increase as the quark mass gets smaller .",
    "both these observations are consistent with the expected qualitative features of finite - size effects .",
    "the difference in @xmath70 determined for the two lattice sizes amounts to 0.6% at the largest and 1.5% at the smallest quark mass . at all values of @xmath22 the deviation is a two-@xmath71 effect .",
    "by contrast , no statistically significant finite size effects are observed in the vector channel .",
    "in fact , the values for @xmath72 are slightly higher on the larger lattice .",
    "this might be attributed to the fact that no estimate for contributions from excited states was available for all hadron masses computed on @xmath48 , since only single - cosh fits could be performed .",
    "indeed , one of the caveats in the analysis of finite volume effects in both channels is the fact that the data for the two lattice sizes shown in tables  [ tab_ps_np ] and  [ tab_vec_np ] have not been obtained using the same fitting procedure .",
    "we have , therefore , repeated the analysis for the smaller volume , by performing single - cosh fits for appropriately chosen intervals .",
    "the results are consistent with those shown in the tables .",
    "however , in the pseudoscalar channel it is also possible to choose small fitting intervals close to @xmath49 such that the single - cosh fits on @xmath68 produce smaller values with larger errors , which are both compatible with the results in the tables and also with those obtained on the larger volume .",
    "we conclude that the finite size effects observed in the pseudoscalar channel appear to be genuine , but without further investigations one can not rule out entirely that they have a statistical origin . for vector mesons no significant effects",
    "are observed .",
    "it has been known for some time that lattice results obtained in the quenched approximation fail to reproduce the experimental fact that the vector - pseudoscalar hyperfine splitting is constant over a wide range of quark masses , i.e. @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , lattice estimates for this quantity are in general much lower when unimproved wilson fermions are employed .    in order to study the effect of @xmath0 improvement on the hyperfine splitting",
    "we have plotted our results for the np and tad datasets in fig.[fig_splittings](a ) and(b ) , respectively . in order to display the influence of finite lattice spacing ,",
    "we have expressed our results in units of the hadronic radius @xmath74@xcite , using its lattice determination in ref.@xcite .",
    "the figure demonstrates that with improvement ( either non - perturbative or mean field ) the hyperfine splittings show much weaker variation over the studied range of quark masses , compared to the unimproved case ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "however , the small slope in the data for @xmath75 as a function of @xmath76 suggests that the experimentally observed _ very _ weak dependence on the quark mass is not reproduced by the lattice data . by comparing the np and tad datasets",
    "it appears that the dependence on the lattice spacing is somewhat smaller for non - perturbative @xmath1 .",
    "of course this needs to be corroborated in a real scaling analysis at a fixed value of @xmath76 .    at first sight",
    "it may seem surprising that the lattice results for the hyperfine splitting overestimate the experimentally observed values . however , lattice results for the splittings in the quenched approximation in physical units depend strongly on the choice of scale .",
    "indeed , if the scale is set using @xmath77 the lattice values are much closer to experiment @xcite . however , the main focus of this discussion is the analysis of the dependence on the quark mass and the lattice spacing .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 was introduced @xcite as a means to detect deviations between the quenched approximation and the observed hadron spectrum without relying on chiral extrapolations .",
    "it is defined through @xmath78 and is thus related closely to the slope of the vector - pseudoscalar splitting discussed above .",
    "its phenomenological value has been determined from the experimentally measured masses as @xmath79 .    in fig.[fig_j_all ]",
    "we plot our results for all our datasets as a function of the lattice spacing .",
    "our values confirm previous observations that @xmath2 is underestimated in the quenched approximation .",
    "in fact , one finds that the low values for @xmath2 have little to do with lattice artefacts , since there is no sign of the data approaching the phenomenological value for @xmath2 in the continuum limit .",
    "we conclude that low lattice estimates for @xmath2 appear to be an intrinsic feature of the quenched approximation .",
    "our results for masses of octet and decuplet baryons are shown in tables  [ tab_bardeg_np][tab_barnondeg_tad_62 ] .",
    "they have been obtained by performing double - exponential fits to the ( ll , ss ) or ( ll , sl ) combination of baryon correlation functions , except on @xmath48 for the np dataset at @xmath16 , where  in analogy to the fits of the large - volume data in the mesonic sector  only single exponential fits to smeared correlators were considered .",
    "tables  [ tab_bardeg_np ] and  [ tab_bardeg_tad ] contain the results for baryon masses in the nucleon @xmath80 and @xmath81 @xmath82 channels for degenerate combinations of quark masses , together with the fitting ranges and the values of @xmath67 .",
    "these results can be extrapolated to the physical values of the quark masses in order to determine the masses of the nucleon , the @xmath83 and the @xmath84 , as described in sect .",
    "[ sec_quarkmassdep ] .      in order to compute the masses of the physical @xmath85 and @xmath86 states one has to consider baryon correlators for non - degenerate combinations of quark masses . in the octet sector",

    "the corresponding correlators are obtained by performing the appropriate contractions @xcite .",

    "the correlators for decuplet baryons , which are symmetric in all flavours @xmath89 are simpler to construct .",
    "they are obtained in terms of the interpolating operator @xmath92 where @xmath93 denote the quark flavour , @xmath94 are colour indices , and @xmath95 is the charge conjugation matrix .",
    "correlation functions for decuplet baryons are constructed from the correlation of @xmath96 by projecting out the spin-@xmath97 component .    in tables",

    "the fitting intervals , which are not shown , are mostly identical to those chosen for the corresponding channels in the degenerate case ( tables  [ tab_bardeg_np ] and  [ tab_bardeg_tad ] ) . with our statistical accuracy",
    "we are not able to distinguish between @xmath87- and @xmath88-like states ; the different symmetry properties in the quark flavours corresponding to the hopping parameters @xmath99 and @xmath100 do not manifest themselves in statistically significant mass differences .    by extrapolating or interpolating the data in @xmath101 to the hopping parameters corresponding to the physical quark",
    "masses one obtains the masses of the @xmath102 and  @xmath103 .",
    "note that non - degenerate combinations of quark masses have not been computed at @xmath104 .",
    "the issue of finite - volume effects is of special importance in the baryonic sector where these effects are expected to be more severe than for mesons . with our data",
    "we can assess the influence of finite - volume effects by comparing our results computed at @xmath16 on either @xmath43 or @xmath48 using the non - perturbative value of @xmath1 .",
    "the numbers in tables  [ tab_bardeg_np ] , [ tab_barnondeg_np_60small ] and  [ tab_barnondeg_np_60large ] suggest that on the large volume the mass estimates for both octet and decuplet baryons are slightly smaller . for octet baryons",
    "this decrease amounts to about 1.4% at the largest and 2.7% at the smallest quark masses .",
    "the effect is roughly twice as large as for the pseudoscalar mesons discussed earlier .",
    "although finite - size effects for octet baryons are not significant at our level of statistical accuracy , this does not necessarily indicate that those effects are absent .    for decuplet baryons",
    "the finite - volume effects are more pronounced ; they vary between  2.4 and  5.5% , again increasing towards smaller quark masses . here",
    "the discrepancy between the results on the small and large volumes amounts to about 1.5 standard deviations .",
    "thus we can not exclude finite - size effects in our baryon data at a level of up to 2.5% for octet and 5.5% for decuplet baryons .",
    "in this section we discuss the dependence of mesons and baryons on the quark mass .",
    "usually this dependence is modelled using the results of chiral perturbation theory at lowest order .",
    "it is then quite a delicate problem to decide whether higher orders in the chiral expansion have to be included .",
    "furthermore , additional care must be taken in the quenched approximation , where one expects deviations from the leading behaviour for very small quark masses ( i.e. close to the chiral limit ) , due to the appearance of quenched chiral logarithms  @xcite .",
    "we will first motivate the functional forms for the quark mass dependence used in this paper , determine the critical hopping parameter and then present our results for hadron masses extrapolated or interpolated to the physical quark masses .",
    "usually the critical value of the hopping parameter , @xmath24 , is determined at the point where the mass of the pseudoscalar meson vanishes , @xmath105 .",
    "the simplest ansatz for the quark mass dependence of @xmath106 , which is consistent with @xmath0 improvement , is @xmath107 where @xmath108 denotes the rescaled , bare quark mass defined in eq.([eq_mqtildedef ] ) .",

    "@xcite we find differences of 12 standard deviations at most .",
    "since the numerical procedures employed in  @xcite are quite different to those used in this paper ( see also  @xcite ) this agreement is an important check of the stability of our results , both at finite lattice spacing and in the continuum limit .    as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "one important goal of this study is to corroborate earlier findings by gf11  @xcite and the cp - pacs collaboration  @xcite , using an improved discretisation of the qcd action . in fig .",

    "the first observation is that , on the whole , the two simulations agree quite well , although the errors quoted by cp - pacs are in general much smaller .",
    "this confirms the previous conclusion that the quenched light hadron spectrum agrees within 10% with experiment .",
    "this independent confirmation , using results in the @xmath0 improved theory , is an important result , since lattice artefacts for unimproved wilson fermions are in general much larger  @xcite , so that continuum extrapolations can be quite drastic .",
    "it must be mentioned , though , that the overall precision of our results can not match that of ref .",
    "@xcite for the following reasons .",
    "firstly , our calculations have been performed in a fairly narrow range of quark masses , for relatively small volumes ( mostly for @xmath68 ) .",
    "therefore , possible deviations from a linear quark mass dependence close to the chiral limit could not be detected or controlled .",
    "this affects mainly states like the @xmath174 , nucleon or the @xmath81 .",
    "indeed , the modelling of the observed downward curvature in the data reported in  @xcite turned out to be a significant factor in the detection of the deviation from the experimentally observed spectrum . furthermore ,",
    "as far as our baryonic data are concerned , the chiral behaviour at @xmath104 is not controlled at all , since only two data points have been computed , so that we had to _ assume _ linearity in the quark mass . finally , our data are subject to finite - size corrections . for hadron masses computed at the physical values of the quark",
    "masses these effects amount to at most 2% for vector mesons , @xmath175 for octet and @xmath176 for decuplet baryons ( c.f .",
    "tables  [ tab_res_r0][tab_all_res_b60large ] ) .    to some extent",
    "one can check against possible finite - size effects in our results by setting the scale using the nucleon mass . as a baryon",
    "the nucleon might also be affected more by finite - size effects , and it is reasonable to expect a ( partial ) cancellation of these effects in the ratios @xmath177 . indeed , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig_quenchedspectrum ] our results in physical units decrease when the scale is set by @xmath150 rather than @xmath166 , although the difference is mostly not significant .",
    "if the differences in the results due to different choices of the lattice scale is not attributed to finite - size effects , then they serve to estimate the intrinsic scale ambiguity in the quenched approximation in the continuum limit . on the basis of the results in tables",
    "[ tab_res_r0][tab_res_mnuc ] one can infer that in the most extreme cases the difference between the highest and lowest values in physical units amounts to about 20% .",
    "we may then assign an uncertainty of @xmath178 to our results in physical units as a consequence of the scale ambiguity .    to summarise ,",
    "we have presented a comprehensive study of the light hadron spectrum in quenched qcd , using improved wilson actions .",
    "qualitative results indicate an improved behaviour of the pseudoscalar - vector mass splitting .",
    "the parameter  @xmath2 , on the other hand , shows no sign of approaching its phenomenological value of  @xmath179 , even in the continuum limit .",
    "this appears to be an intrinsic feature of the quenched approximation .",
    "our results show that @xmath0 improvement works well for spectral quantities .",
    "hadron masses computed for non - perturbative  @xmath1 and expressed in units of  @xmath74 show almost no dependence on the lattice spacing for @xmath170 .",
    "we also find that the extrapolations to the continuum limit are quite mild in general .",
    "that is , for @xmath169 lattice artefacts amount to about 5% or less .",
    "we have presented further evidence that the quenched light hadron spectrum agrees with experiment to within 10% .",
    "further technical improvements , including , in particular , the modelling of the quark mass dependence and the addition of more points in the continuum extrapolations should be implemented to increase the overall precision .",
