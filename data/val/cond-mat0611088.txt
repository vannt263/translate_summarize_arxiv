    "boolean networks ( bns ) are dynamical models originally introduced by s. kauffman in the late 60s @xcite . since kauffman s seminal work , they have been used as abstract modeling schemes in many different fields , including cell differentiation , immune response , evolution , and gene - regulatory networks ( for an introductory review see @xcite and references therein ) . in recent days , bns have received a renewed attention as a powerful scheme of data analysis and modeling of high - throughput genomics and proteomics experiments @xcite .    the bottom - line of previous research has been the description and classification of different attractor types present in bns under deterministic parallel update dynamics @xcite .",
    "special attention was dedicated to so - called critical bns @xcite situated at the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes .",
    "recently , a new point of view has been introduced that casts the original dynamical problem into a _ constraint satisfaction problem _ , that can be studied with theoretical and algorithmic tools inspired from the statistical mechanics of disordered systems @xcite .    following this new approach presented in @xcite it is possible to study the organization of fixed points in the thermodynamic limit in random boolean networks .",
    "this leads to the identification of the sudden emergence of a computational core , whose existence is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a globally complex phase where all fixed points are organized in an exponential number of macroscopically separated clusters .",
    "this phenomenon is found to be robust with respect to the choice of the boolean functions , and missing only in networks where all boolean functions are of and or or type .",
    "in addition , the size of the complex regulatory phase is found to grow with the number @xmath0 of inputs to the boolean functions .",
    "the main motivation for this work is to check the robustness of the above - reported results in networks of finite size , both from the theoretical and algorithmic point of view .",
    "we aim at understanding how reliable the predictions of message passing algorithms such as belief propagation ( bp ) are on graphs of finite - size .",
    "we performed an extensive numerical check on the number of solutions in small samples , comparing bp predictions to exact exhaustive enumeration algorithms results .",
    "results of bp on directed bns are found to be in very good agreement with exact ones when counting the expected number of fixed points . a worse performance of bp is found in its prediction of local quantities such as the single nodes marginal probabilities .",
    "nevertheless , the performance seems to increase with system sizes for already moderate size values .    in",
    "we define the model , in we describe the belief propagation algorithm and the strategy we adopted to obtain exhaustively all solutions of our bn s model . in",
    "we quantify numerically the agreement between bp and the exhaustive search results .",
    "furthermore , a brief analysis on the distribution of the overlap of the solutions is presented .",
    "finally in we present the analytical computation of the first and second moment of the average number of solutions of our model of bns .",
    "numerical solutions of the bp equations strongly suggest that the annealed calculation of the entropy ( logarithm of the number of bn fixed points ) is exact in the large size random case .",
    "fluctuations over the annealed value are computed numerically and successfully confronted with analytical estimates of the second moment of the number of fixed points .",
    "the large size limiting value of the fluctuations around the annealed result is also computed , and some considerations are discussed .",
    "in the following we will consider a bn of @xmath1 interacting variables @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "in general , each variable can be regulated by @xmath0 other _ parent variables _ , and can enter in the regulation of an arbitrary number of _ child variables_. we then consider @xmath4 boolean functions , represented by @xmath5 with @xmath6 , depending on @xmath7 inputs and having a single output .",
    "the truth value of a given output variable @xmath8 is then fixed by the truth values of the regulating variables @xmath9 via the relation : @xmath10 with @xmath11 running over all regulated genes . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : network ] , not all variables need to be controlled by a boolean function , _",
    "i.e. _  in general we have @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "are external inputs ( non - regulated variables ) . ]",
    "[ fig : network ]    on the other hand , each regulated variable is the output of one and only one function .",
    "the whole set of @xmath14 boolean constraints completely specifies the network topology .",
    "we aim at computing @xmath15 , _",
    "i.e. _ the number of stationary points of the network .",
    "we introduce a hamiltonian , that it is equal to the number of unsatisfied boolean constraints : @xmath16 where the symbol @xmath17 stands for the logical operation xor .",
    "we will consider _ random factor graphs _ characterized ( among all possible random graphs ) by :    * function nodes @xmath5 have fixed in - degree @xmath0 and out - degree one . *",
    "variables @xmath8 have in - degree at most one .",
    "this means that all regulating variables are collected in one single constraint @xmath5 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : function ] ) ) .    setting @xmath18 , the degree distribution of variable nodes approaches asymptotically @xmath19    we now have to specify the functions in the factor nodes present on the random factor graph defined so far , i.e we have to specify not only the topology of the graph , but also the content .",
    "there are @xmath20 possible boolean functions with 2 inputs and 1 output .",
    "following @xcite , we group them into 4 classes :    * the two constant functions equal to 0 and 1 . *",
    "four functions depending only on one of the two inputs ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath21 . * and - or class",
    ": there are eight functions , which are given by the logical and or or of the two input variables , or of their negations .",
    "these functions are _",
    "canalizing_. if , e.g. , in the case @xmath22 the value of @xmath23 is set to zero , the output is fixed to zero independently of the value of @xmath24 .",
    "it is said that @xmath23 is a _ canalizing variable _ of @xmath25 with the _ canalizing value _ zero . * xor class : the last two functions are the xor of the two inputs , and its negation .",
    "these two functions are not canalizing , whatever input is changed , the output changes too .    for the sake of clarity we concentrate only on classes depending effectively on two inputs , _",
    "i.e. _  on those in the and - or class and the xor class .",
    "as we will see in the following sections , the average number of fixed points does not depend on the relative appearance of the functions within each class , but only on the relative appearance of the classes .",
    "we therefore require @xmath26 functions to be in the xor class , and the remaining @xmath27 functions to be of the and - or type , with @xmath28 being a free model parameter . in this simple case",
    "the network ensemble is then completely defined by @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "belief propagation is a marginalization algorithm used with success in many different fields .",
    "it is exact on a tree , _",
    "i.e. _ on a graph with no loops , but it is also known to give good estimates of the marginals in other cases .    in this section we will first introduce the bp algorithm , and then we will explain the strategy adopted for the exhaustive search .",
    "the bp algorithm @xcite is an iterative strategy for computing the fraction of zero - energy configurations having , say , @xmath31 .",
    "more generally , bp calculates marginal probability distributions of solutions of problems defined on factor graphs .",
    "a more detailed introduction on the bp equations in the case of bns can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us define @xmath32 one of the clauses where @xmath33 appears .",
    "one can introduce the following quantities :    * @xmath34 : the probability that variable @xmath35 takes value @xmath33 in the absence of clause @xmath32 .",
    "* @xmath36 : are a function proportional to the probability that clause @xmath32 is satisfied when variable @xmath35 takes value @xmath33 .",
    "the above - defined quantities satisfy the following set of equations : @xmath37 % gp f iisuppose   \\prod_{b \\in a \\setminus i } \\mu_{b\\rightarrow i } ( x_i )   \\nonumber\\\\ \\mu_{i\\rightarrow a}(x_i ) & = & c_{i\\rightarrow a } \\prod _ { b\\in i    \\setminus a } m_{b\\rightarrow i}(x_i)\\,\\,\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 represents the set of all variable indexes belonging to function @xmath32 _ except _ variable index @xmath35 , @xmath39 the set of all function indexes to which variable @xmath33 belongs , _ except _ index @xmath32 , and @xmath40 is a constant enforcing the normalization of the probability distribution @xmath41 .",
    "this set of equations can be numerically iterated up to their fixed point , if present .",
    "it turns out @xcite that , in the case of our model , the iterative procedure always converges .",
    "marginals can be computed in terms of the messages in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bp ] ) via the following set of relations : @xmath42 \\prod_{i \\in a }   \\mu_{i\\rightarrow a}(x_i)\\nonumber \\\\",
    "p_i ( x_i )   & = & c_i \\prod_{a\\in i }   m_{a\\rightarrow i}\\,\\,\\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are again normalization constants . from the marginals we can eventually compute the entropy , _",
    "i.e. _ the logarithm of the number ( @xmath45 ) of zero energy configurations : @xmath46      no known polynomial algorithm is generally able to exhaustively find all the solutions of a boolean constraint satisfaction problem like this one .",
    "there is however a number of efficient implementations of exhaustive search strategies - still exponential in the running times - that allow to explore problems of reasonable size .    in our case",
    "we have mapped the random bn instances onto _ conjunctive normal form _ ( cnf ) formulas .",
    "such instances are made of several clauses put in and disjunction , each clause being made of literals in or conjunction .",
    "this is the natural form of the well - known satisfiability problem .",
    "the mapping is done writing in the cnf formula all the configurations which violate a clause in the rbn instance , and negating the literals for the true variables . as an example",
    ", it is simple to verify that a and node involving @xmath47 e @xmath48 as : @xmath49 can be written in cnf in the following way : @xmath50    once the problem is cast in this form , we can exploit the vast number of very well performing algorithms existing for solving satisfiability instances @xcite .",
    "we are interested now in _ exhaustive search _ programs , among which we choose ` relsat  2.00 ` @xcite .",
    "this award - winning program can perform a complete search of the solution space for instances up to @xmath51 variables ( in our model ) in accessible time using a common pc .",
    "in this section we will check the predictive precision of the bp algorithm measuring the entropy and the magnetization vector .      in @xcite",
    "it has been pointed out using an heuristic argument that , for this model of random bns , the average number of solutions is always equal to @xmath52 _ i.e. _ to the number of all possible external input configurations ( note that @xmath53 is exactly the number of non - regulated sites ) . a direct numerical check of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bp ] ) on single samples shows that the bp predictions are always in agreement with the above - mentioned heuristic prediction , so that for any sample , the entropy density @xmath54 , independently from the sample realization and the percentage @xmath30 of xor functions , apart from terms that vanish when @xmath55 .",

    ", the probability of extracting two random solutions from the same cluster is negligibly small even for moderate sizes .",

    "[ nsol_dist ]    in this section we will show that the logarithm of the number of solutions ( _ i.e. _ the entropy ) of our model of bns computed within the annealed approximation scheme agrees with the numerical estimate for the entropy we performed by exhaustive enumeration and by the numerical solution of the bp equations on single sample .    this feature allows us to make some conjectures , and check whether the annealed approximation is exact in the @xmath55 limit .",
    "we will show that the variance of @xmath100 as well as all higher moments are proportional to @xmath101 in the large @xmath1 limit , with a proportionality constant depending only on @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that a non zero contribution to the entropy is given at the leading order only by the external regulating variables , in accordance with results obtained in @xcite .",

    "moreover , we will see that in the thermodynamic limit : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a constant independent of @xmath1 . only in the case of pure xor classes ( @xmath94 ) , it is possible to show that the proportionality constant is exactly @xmath105 the large @xmath1 limit for any order moment and any value of @xmath29 , implying that the annealed approximation is exact .",
    "let s consider a distribution of positive random variables @xmath106 .",
    "as we are interested in the relation between the quenched entropy and the annealed approximation , we want to investigate the relation between @xmath107 and @xmath108 , where @xmath109 identifies here the average over the distribution of @xmath106 .",
    "we can write : @xmath110 where we have expressed the quenched entropy in term of the annealed one plus a series of the moments of the distribution . in our case",
    "we take @xmath111 . in cases where the sum of the series of moments is finite or for any @xmath30 and @xmath29",
    "diverges as a function @xmath112 of the size of the graph such that @xmath113 , then the quenched and the annealed entropies coincide .",
    "we will show that this is the case at least for the second order moment .",
    "it is important to state , however , that the previous series expansion is valid only if @xmath114 , and that averaging the resulting series term by term is possible only if the sum can be taken out of the integral which defines the average .",
    "these conditions are not always met in our model , and in particular we expect the existence of a certain range of @xmath30 and @xmath29 values beyond which the conditions are not necessarily satisfied . in particular we will also show that in the thermodynamic limit @xmath115 however this will not necessarily undermine the validity of the annealed calculation .    under the hypothesis of equation ( [ diverge ] ) , and",
    "thanks to a straightforward implementation of the tschebichev inequality , one can easily show that , ( see [ app : cheby ] ) @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a positive constant .",
    "this implies that , in the thermodynamic limit , the probability distribution of the number of solutions has support in the interval @xmath118 . unfortunately in order to take under control also the left tail of the distribution one should compute moments of the type @xmath119 with @xmath120 , which is , as indicated in [ app : high_mom ] , a rather complicated task .",
