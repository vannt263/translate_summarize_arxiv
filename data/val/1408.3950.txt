    "periodically driven systems which allow for the extraction of work out of an unbiased environment are often termed ratchets. because , originally these systems relied on the rectification of thermal noise they were seen as realizations of brownian motors the corresponding research field being highly active ( see @xcite and references therein ) . as one of the many considered experimental playgrounds for ratchets physics , cold atoms loaded into driven optical lattices have proven to be particularly insightful since they allow for a precise control over the systems parameters @xcite .",
    "while some of these experiments are carried out at moderate temperatures and allow for a classical treatment @xcite , others could reach ultracold temperatures and demonstrated the accessibility of hamiltonian ratchet setups operating deep in the quantum regime @xcite .",
    "the experimental advancements concerning these newly realized quantum ratchets were accompanied by a substantial body of theoretical works ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thereby , one of the main achievements was the classification of the symmetries which need to be broken in order to allow for the observation of a ratchet current @xcite .",
    "besides that , the discussed phenomena associated to quantum ratchets were manifold .",
    "examples are the existence of resonances in the directed current @xcite , the possibility to tune the dispersion rate of a wave packet @xcite or the harvesting of landau - zener transitions @xcite .",
    "another active sub - area of ratchet physics are periodically kicked systems , which have the advantage of being more accessible from a theorists point of view due to the simpler delta - shaped time dependence . in these , similar effects as for the aforementioned smoothly driven setups",
    "could be observed , such as directed transport , resonance behaviour and even the acceleration of ratchet currents @xcite .",
    "+ in any case , all of the aforementioned works related to ratchet physics , be it classical- , quantum- , smoothly driven- or kicked , are restricted to globally acting driving forces . over the last years",
    "however it was shown for classical particles loaded into driven lattices , that a site - dependent driving can add to the already existing diversity of physical phenomena in ratchet setups @xcite . in @xcite for example it was shown how a protocol based on a site - dependent driving leads to the patterned deposition of particles out of a uniform initial particle distribution .",
    "furthermore , @xcite demonstrated the possibility for particles to undergo conversion processes from diffusive- to regular motion , something explicitly forbidden for globally uniform driving forces and which leads to a plethora of nonequilibrium phenomena for the dynamics .",
    "inspired by these interesting observations , it seems an intriguing perspective to carry over the idea of a spatially non - global driving from the classical setups to the realm of quantum ratchets .",
    "this is precisely the purpose of this work .",
    "an additional motivation to this project is the upcoming of cold atom experiments which also deviate from the simple case of a spatially uniform driving force .",
    "a noteworthy idea in this context is the introduction of sub - wavelength lattices @xcite which allow for the construction of more complicated unit cells of the lattice .",
    "full control over each of the lattice barriers is achieved in experiments with so called painted potentials @xcite , even though these are until now restricted to just a few barriers and do not yet consider extended lattices .",
    "+ in the present paper we show that for a quantum particle exposed to a periodically oscillating lattice , the inclusion of a site - dependent driving indeed leads to novel phenomena .",
    "such setups are investigated here in the framework of floquet - bloch theory and we demonstrate how , by breaking the translational invariance through the local driving , a set of new symmetry classes for the floquet - bloch modes evolves .",
    "this is demonstrated to have significant impact on the floquet spectrum where we observe the transformation from exact- to avoided crossings for a deviation from the global driving towards a site - dependent one .",
    "even more , we find that the width of the resulting avoided crossing is controllable through variation of a single parameter of the local driving .",
    "this is particularly interesting , because the width of avoided crossings in floquet spectra of driven lattices is of relevance for a variety of physical phenomena two noteworthy examples being the already mentioned landau - zener transitions @xcite or quite generally the diffusion properties of a wave - packet @xcite .",
    "finally , we show the possibility for a directed current in our system , even for the case where all individual barriers do not break the relevant symmetries .",
    "consequently , the symmetry breaking becomes a collective phenomenon of the barriers constituting the lattice .",
    "+ this work is structured in the following way : in section [ s1 ] we introduce the setup of the spatiotemporally driven lattice . in section [ s2 ] we show how a well - known scheme to calculate the time evolution operator in a periodically driven system can be extended in order to simulate the time evolution in a site - dependently driven lattice . in doing so , we also take the possibility of nonzero quasi - momenta into account . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we perform a thorough symmetry analysis and identify symmetry classes for the floquet - bloch modes , which arise due to the site - dependent driving . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we show how the existence of these newly found symmetry classes is translated into properties of the floquet spectrum .",
    "section [ s5 ] contains an investigation of the transport properties of our setup .",
    "finally , we conclude and provide an outlook in section [ s6 ] .",
    "the system under investigation consists of a single quantum particle in one dimension exposed to a laterally oscillating lattice of gaussian potential barriers .",
    "hence the dynamics obeys the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 denote position and time and the hamiltonian is given by @xmath3 here , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the barrier width , the distance between the barriers equilibrium positions , the particles mass and @xmath7 is the height of the potential barriers respectively , while @xmath8 is the driving law . without loss of generality we will set @xmath9 in the following .",
    "the crucial difference to hamiltonians usually studied in investigations of driven lattices in the quantum regime is that the driving law carries a barrier index @xmath10 and thus can be site - dependent . throughout this work",
    ", we employ a cosine driving with equal amplitude and frequency but with possibly different phases : @xmath11 moreover , we restrict ourselves to sequences of the barrier phases which periodically repeat themselves after some number of barriers @xmath12 , i.e. we have @xmath13 . because of the intimate relation between the driving of a lattice site and its barrier index @xmath10 , and thus its position within the lattice , we call a setup with @xmath14 a spatiotemporally driven lattice .",
    "in contrast , for the case of only a single employed driving law , i.e. @xmath15 , we say the lattice is uniformly driven .",
    "a sketch of a spatiotemporally driven lattice for the case of three different driving laws ( @xmath16 ) is shown in fig 1 .",
    "+ in principle one could also imagine more complicated unit cells containing more barriers or even more complicated driving laws",
    ". the only restrictions that we have to make in order to employ the computational scheme as presented in the following section , is that the hamiltonian remains periodic in time and that two neighbouring barriers do not have a notable overlap at any time .",

    "three different driving laws @xmath8 for @xmath17 are periodically repeated .",
    "the shaded barriers indicate the equidistant equilibrium positions of the barriers . ]",
    "in this section we develop a computational scheme in the framework of floquet - bloch theory which enables us to propagate an arbitrary initial state according to the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "[ hamiltonian ] .",
    "our formalism is based on the ideas presented in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and was originally designed to study atomic and molecular multi - photon processes . in the following ,",
    "we show how the formalism can be extended in order to describe the dynamics in spatiotemporally driven lattice as introduced in the previous section . in doing so",
    ", we have incorporated the possibility of a nonzero quasi - momentum as well as the complex nature of the unit cell which can contain several barriers , each equipped with a different driving law .",
    "to be self - contained , let us start by summing up the most important results from floquet and bloch theory . because the hamiltonian under investigation is periodic in time with @xmath18 and @xmath19 , floquets theorem ensures that every solution of eq .",
    "[ schrodinger ] can be written as @xmath20 where the floquet mode ( fm ) @xmath21 respects the periodicity of the hamiltonian , i.e. @xmath22 and @xmath23 is a real number often termed the quasi - energy ( qe ) .",
    "it is straightforward to see that adding or subtracting some integer multiple of @xmath24 to the qe while simultaneously multiplying the fm by an appropriate phase factor leaves the solution of the tdse @xmath25 invariant .",
    "hence , the qes can always be chosen to be within the interval : @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "+ knowing the fms of our system is of particular relevance because it allows to compute the time evolution of any initial state .",
    "this is because they are eigenstates of the time evolution operator @xmath27 over one period of the driving : @xmath28 which follows directly from applying the time evolution operator @xmath29 to the solution of the tdse @xmath25 .",
    "hence , the stroboscopic time evolution of an arbitrary initial state can be calculated as @xcite @xmath30 where the @xmath31 are obtained as the overlap of the initial state with the fm @xmath32 .",
    "so far we have only taken into account the temporal periodicity of our system .",
    "however , the hamiltonian considered in this work features spatial periodicity as well , since @xmath33 .",
    "accordingly , the fms can be written in terms of floquet - bloch modes ( fbms ) as @xmath34 with @xmath35 and @xmath36 $ ] being the quasi - momentum .",
    "the stroboscopic time evolution for an initial state ( eq . [ time easy ] ) becomes @xcite then @xmath37      apparently , once the fbms @xmath38 are known , any quantum state @xmath39 can be propagated stroboscopically according to eq .",
    "[ time ] . in the following",
    "we explain how the fbms can be obtained numerically in an efficient way .",
    "the general idea is to make use of the fact that -as mentioned above- the fbms are eigenstates of the one period time evolution operator @xmath29 .",
    "accordingly , once the matrix representation of this operator is calculated in some basis it can be diagonalized and one obtains both the fbms @xmath40 as well as the corresponding qes @xmath41 .      the first step towards the calculation of the matrix representation of the evolution operator , and with this of the fbms , is to specify the hilbert space @xmath42 in which the solutions of the tdse ( eq . ) can be represented .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that @xmath42 can be composed as a product space of the hilbert space of square integrable functions @xmath43 and of the hilbert space of time periodic functions @xmath44 .",
    "+ in the following we define appropriate bases for @xmath43,@xmath44 and finally for @xmath42 .",
    "the states that we want to represent in @xmath42 , namely the fbms , have to obey bloch s theorem .",
    "this imposes that of the square integrable functions constituting the hilbert space @xmath43 we are only interested in the ones obeying @xmath45 .",
    "we can take this into account by choosing quasi - momentum dependent basis vectors : @xmath46 for @xmath47 which are in accordance to the bloch theorem since @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "hence , once the time evolution operator is obtained in this basis and the fbms are calculated as its eigenvectors , they will automatically satisfy bloch s theorem because the basis in which they are expanded does .",
    "the inner product in @xmath43 can be defined as @xmath50 for @xmath51 . for the hilbert space of time periodic functions @xmath44 the inner product",
    "is given by @xmath52 for @xmath53 and a natural choice for the basis vectors are the fourier vectors @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "+ as mentioned earlier , the entire solution space @xmath42 of eq .",
    "can be constructed as the product space : @xmath56 .",
    "thus , a possible choice of basis vectors for @xmath42 is given by the product basis : @xmath57 and the scalar product associated to @xmath42 is : @xmath58      after we have specified the solution space of the tdse we are ready to calculate its solutions , or more precisely its fbms . as mentioned before ,",
    "this can be done by finding the eigenvectors of the one period time evolution operator @xmath29 .",
    "+ it was shown in @xcite that the time evolution operator represented in our basis of @xmath43 can be calculated for zero quasi - momentum as : @xmath59 where the floquet operator @xmath60 was introduced . because in this work the authors were interested in the time evolution of a single atom in a spatially homogeneous oscillating magnetic field , there was no need for the introduction of a nonzero quasi - momentum .",
    "we however , are interested in the action of a spatially periodic inhomogeneous potential and are therefore entitled to consider the case @xmath61 as well . in order to do this",
    ", we exploit that states of different quasi - momenta are of course not mixed through the action of the hamiltonian .",
    "thus the matrix representation of the time evolution operator @xmath62 can be thought of being a block matrix , where every block acts only on states with a certain quasi - momentum @xmath63 .",
    "for each of these blocks we introduce the notation @xmath64 .",
    "equation can be adjusted easily , by replacing the mere plane wave basis @xmath65 with the in section [ hilbert space ] introduced @xmath63-dependent basis vectors @xmath66 .",
    "thus we obtain for the evolution operator for now arbitrary quasi - momentum : @xmath67 which is for @xmath68 the desired expression for the matrix elements of the time evolution operator over one driving period . in the following",
    "we show how eq .",
    "can be evaluated numerically . to begin with",
    ", we divide the interval @xmath69 into @xmath70 small intervals of length @xmath71 , thus allowing for a truncation of the exponential series for sufficiently small @xmath71 .",
    "hence , the quantity of interest becomes the evolution operator over the @xmath72th short time span @xmath71 : @xmath73 for @xmath74 , while the full operator can be obtained as the product of all @xmath75 afterwards ( we omit the matrix indices @xmath76 and @xmath77 for the sake of clarity ) : @xmath78 from eq .",
    "we get @xmath79 where in a numerical calculation @xmath80 has to be sufficiently large to ensure convergence and @xmath81 are the matrix elements of the @xmath82-th power of the floquet operator @xmath83 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown how these can be calculated recursively for @xmath84 .",
    "for nonzero quasi - momentum we obtain ( see appendix : [ a1 ] ) @xmath85 thereby , @xmath86 and @xmath87 have to be sufficiently large to ensure convergence and @xmath88 is the matrix element of the @xmath89-th fourier coefficient of @xmath90 represented in the basis of @xmath43 , i.e. @xmath91 it is straightforward to see that the fourier components of the hamiltonian are @xmath92 with @xmath93 where the @xmath63-dependence can be omitted since the potential is a function solely of the position operator and not of its derivatives and therefore : @xmath94 .",
    "so far we have seen how the time evolution operator @xmath95 for a given quasi - momentum @xmath63 can be calculated by evaluating the matrix elements of the powers of the floquet operator as given by eq .",
    ", which in turn requires the calculation of the fourier components of the hamiltonian via eq .. the remaining task is to compute the fourier components of the potential @xmath96 , or more precisely their matrix representations in @xmath43 : @xmath97 .",
    "note that the so far described formalism does not distinguish between uniform- and spatiotemporal driving .",
    "however , this becomes relevant for the fourier decomposition of the potential @xmath96 as we shall see in the following .",
    "+ let us start by considering the potential of a single oscillating barrier which will be denoted by @xmath98 in the following .",
    "performing a fourier transformation yields @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "if we now include a nonzero initial time @xmath101 as well as possible phase of the barrier motion of @xmath102 ( cf .",
    ", we get via the transformation @xmath103 : @xmath104 apparently , the phase shift @xmath102 of a barrier leads to a complex phase factor of @xmath105 of the corresponding fourier coefficient . for @xmath12 barriers each with a different phase @xmath106 this generalizes to @xmath107 with @xmath108 being the equilibrium position of the @xmath10th barrier . for the desired matrix representation of this fourier mode @xmath109 this yield ( see appendix [ a2 ] ) @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the @xmath112-th fourier component of a single oscillating barrier represented in our basis of @xmath43 .",
    "+ at this point we have all the ingredients to make use of eq.[time evo operator 2 ] in order to determine the one - period time evolution operator and thus the fbms , the qes and finally the stroboscopic time evolution of arbitrary initial states via eq ..      the final remark of this section shall be on the role of the initial time within the described formalism . due to the linearity of the schrdinger equation ,",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of an observable in a time - dependent system depends , in general , on the initial time @xmath101 .",
    "e.g. in the context of ratchet physics it was shown that the asymptotic transport velocity of an initial state depends crucially on @xmath101 ( see @xcite and also section [ s5 ] ) .",
    "thus , in numerical simulations the time propagation typically has to be performed for many different initial times in order to capture the full physical behaviour . the straightforward way to include different initial times in the formalism as described above ,",
    "is to simply plug in the potential @xmath113 into the calculation of the fourier components of the hamiltonian ( via eq . ) .",
    "the downside of this approach is that the entire formalism to calculate @xmath29 has to be carried out for each considered value of @xmath101 , which can be quite time consuming .",
    "fortunately , there is a much faster way . within the presented formalism",
    "we have calculated the time evolution operator over an entire driving period as the product of @xmath70 operators @xmath114 where each of the @xmath114 propagates the small time step @xmath71 ( see .",
    "the idea is now to calculate the @xmath70 operators @xmath114 for some value of the initial time , say for @xmath115 .",
    "the desired operator @xmath29 for arbitrary @xmath101 can be obtained simply as the product of all the @xmath116 , where the dependence on @xmath101 is now captured in the ordering of the operators .",
    "more precisely , eq .",
    "can be rewritten for @xmath117 as : @xmath118 with @xmath119 where @xmath120 denotes the smallest integer number larger than @xmath1 .",
    "the obvious advantage is , that the @xmath121 have to be calculated only for one initial time .",
    "afterwards , the time evolution operators for arbitrary initial times can be calculated easily by means of matrix multiplication . for the calculation of the fbms in the setup of the spatiotemporally driven lattice , the speed up of this procedure to include the dependence of the initial time -as compared to the previously mentioned straightforward way- proved to be significant and amounted to up to one order of magnitude .",
    "it goes without saying that classifying the symmetries of a physical system is often helpful in order to understand the phenomena occurring in it . in the context of quantum",
    "ratchets for example it was extensively studied how the symmetries of the floquet operator affect the possibility of directed particle motion @xcite . within this section we present the relevant symmetries of the hamiltonian and",
    "deduce their consequences on the time evolution operator as well as on the fbms .",
    "in doing so we start with time reversal- and parity symmetry which are commonly studied in the context of uniformly driven 1d lattices . afterwards",
    ", we investigate the impact of the spatiotemporal driving .",
    "the hamiltonian is symmetric under time reversal if @xmath122 for some appropriate time shift @xmath123 , which we will assume to be zero in the following .",
    "let us start with investigating the consequences of time reversal symmetry on the time evolution operator @xmath27 . for the simpler case of zero quasi - momentum it was shown in @xcite that the matrix elements of @xmath124 in the plane wave basis as used in this work obey : @xmath125 of particular interest is the last named symmetry because it concerns the time evolution operator over an entire driving period , which is the one used to determine the fbms ( see eq.[eigenstates ] ) . by employing ideas from section [ s2 ]",
    "one can readily generalize this symmetry to nonzero values of the quasi - momentum @xmath63 : at the heart of the calculation of the matrix elements of the time evolution operator as given by eq .",
    "is the calculation of the fourier components of the hamiltonian as given by eq .. note that the quasi - momentum @xmath63 only enters in the diagonal term which is proportional to @xmath126 .",
    "apparently , this term is invariant under @xmath127 iff we set @xmath128 simultaneously .",
    "thus the symmetry generalizes for arbitrary quasi - momentum @xmath63 to : @xmath129 in fact we find strong evidence that both symmetries as stated in eq .",
    "are special cases of the more general symmetry which holds here : @xmath130 with @xmath131 . in appendix [ a3 ]",
    "we provide a rigorous proof up to first order in the expansion of the time evolution operator , i.e. for @xmath132 in eq .. beyond first order , we have strong numerical evidence for the validity of eq .. + finally , we consider the consequence of a time reversal symmetry of the hamiltonian on the fbms .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that these must obey @xmath133 for the representation as chosen in this work , this yields for the components of the fbms @xmath134      the hamiltonian is said to be invariant under parity symmetry if @xmath135 for some appropriate spatial shift @xmath136 which we can assume without loss of generality to be zero . as argued in @xcite parity symmetry yields for the time evolution operator :",
    "@xmath137 this relation can be of particular use since it allows us to half the computational effort .",
    "furthermore , this symmetry of the time evolution operator leads to a symmetry of the fbms @xcite : @xmath138 in analogy to the time reversal symmetry ( see eq . )",
    "this yields for the components of the fbms in the representation introduced in section [ s2 ] : @xmath139      apparently , there is the possibility for a hamiltonian to be symmetric under both parity and time reversal symmetry . in this case",
    "it obeys @xmath140 .",
    "the components of the floquet modes have to fulfill both eq . as well as",

    "in doing so , we will show that this partial shift symmetry breaking induced by the complex nature of the unit cell in a spatiotemporally driven lattice has profound consequence both on the time evolution operator as well as on the fbms , which have to the best of our knowledge not yet been discussed in the literature .",

    "likewise , the observed symmetry of @xmath190 can be understood conveniently with the help of the above symmetry analysis . by virtue of eq .",
    "we know that @xmath192 which can be shown easily to imply @xmath190 .",
    "more generally , one can show from eq . that the restrictions on the fbms in the presence of time reversal symmetry ( see eq . ) yield for the husimi representation : @xmath193 analogously , the presence of parity symmetry , where the components of the fbms obey eq .",

    "we investigate the impact of the symmetries as introduced in section [ s3 ] on the floquet spectrum .",
    "this question has been subject of comprehensive research in the case of uniform driving ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and we are going to sum up the most important results . however , our main interest is on the impact of the partially broken shift symmetry induced by the spatiotemporal driving . as before we consider as an exemplary setup a lattice with a unit cell containing three barriers with phases : @xmath173 .",
    "+      an extract of the floquet spectrum for a phase configuration of @xmath199 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( a ) . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under parity symmetry as introduced in section [ s3 ] and we observe that @xmath200 , i.e. the spectrum is symmetric with respect to @xmath84 .",
    "in fact it was argued in @xcite that the invariance of the hamiltonian under either parity- or time reversal symmetry generally yields a spectrum which is symmetric with respect to @xmath84 . in accordance to this",
    ", it is shown how a breaking of these symmetries by setting a second barrier phase , in this case @xmath201 , to a nonzero value leads to a desymmetrization of the spectrum .",
    "note that for such a configuration where we fix two barrier phases to @xmath202 and arbitrary @xmath171 , parity symmetry is always present for @xmath203 .",
    "thus by deviating the value of the phase of the third barrier @xmath201 from zero , one can very reliably tune the asymmetry of the spectrum .      in the following",
    "we show how the deviation from a uniform driving towards a spatiotemporal driving affects the floquet spectrum in a unique way . as a model system",
    "we consider a phase configuration of the barriers in a unit cell of @xmath196 , where as in section [ shift symmetry ] the shift symmetry is said to be partially broken for @xmath204 .",
    "representative extracts of the spectrum for uniform driving ( @xmath205 ) as well as for a spatiotemporal driving ( @xmath204 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( b ) .",
    "the most notable effect is , that the crossings which are exact ones for the uniform driving are casted into avoided crossings in the case of the spatiotemporal driving . at the same time",
    "the crossings which are avoided ones for uniform driving , remain avoided crossings for @xmath204 .",
    "even more , we see that at least to a certain degree one can control the width of the avoided crossing by tuning the phase of the central barrier @xmath171 .",
    "this is best seen for the two crossings at @xmath206 where the widths can be seen to increase for increasing @xmath171 . at this point",
    "it is worth mentioning that the widths of avoided crossings in floquet spectra are crucial for many nonequilibrium phenomena reported in driven lattice setups , such as landau - zener transitions @xcite , the diffusion properties of a wave - packet @xcite or the occurrence of an absolute negative mobility @xcite .",
    "hence , the additional flexibility introduced by the site - dependent driving should contribute to an increased controllability of the aforementioned effects .",
    "for comparison we also show the spectrum of a uniformly driven lattice for two different driving amplitudes @xmath207 and @xmath208 in fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum ] ( c ) . apparently ,",
    "even though the spectrum is altered significantly by the increased driving amplitude , the nature of the crossings , i.e. exact or avoided , is not changed .",
    "+ by means of the symmetry analysis carried out in section [ shift symmetry ] it is quite straightforward to understand why the variation in the barrier phase @xmath171 leads to a transformation of the crossings from exact to avoided while the variation in the global driving amplitude @xmath209 did not .",
    "the key observation lies within eq .",
    ", stating that the fbms must be eigenstates of the operator performing a spatial shift of the barrier distance @xmath5 .",
    "as argued , the allowed eigenvalues for a fbm @xmath210 are then given by @xmath169 for @xmath168 .",
    "thus the fbms can be separated into @xmath12 different symmetry classes , each characterized by one of the @xmath12 different eigenvalues @xmath211 . according to the non - crossing rule",
    "@xcite states belonging to different symmetry classes are allowed to cross , while states within the same symmetry class can not . for a nonzero value of @xmath171",
    "the shift symmetry @xmath212 gets destroyed and eq .",
    "becomes invalid .",
    "hence , the fbms can not be separated into different symmetry classes associated to the shift operator @xmath213 and thus they are not allowed to cross anymore . at this point",
    "it is important to note that , even for a partially broken shift symmetry , the spectrum may still feature exact crossings due to the presence of different symmetry classes associated to parity- or time reversal symmetry . +",
    "in this section , we study the possibility of an asymptotic particle current in the setup of a spatiotemporally driven lattice .",
    "the appearance of such currents in the absence of any mean forces has been studied intensively over the last two decades for uniformly driven lattices ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "[ fig : time_evo_op ] . ]      following @xcite we define the asymptotic quantum current as the time averaged expectation value of the momentum operator for some initial state @xmath215 : @xmath216 one of the perks of using floquet theory in order to study the dynamics of a time - dependent system is that once the fbms are known , the asymptotic current can be calculated very conveniently as @xcite : @xmath217 where @xmath218 is the averaged momentum of the fbm @xmath219 and @xmath220 is the overlap of the initial state with the fbm @xmath221 at time @xmath222 . for a commonly studied initial state of a gaussian wave packet : @xmath223 these two quantities can be calculated as : @xmath224 where as before the @xmath225 are the components of the fbms in our chosen basis which can be calculated according to the numerical scheme presented in section [ s2 ] .      now that we have seen how the asymptotic current @xmath214 can be expressed through the components of the fbms @xmath225 we are able to analyze how the symmetries derived in section [ s3 ] for the @xmath226 are carried over into symmetries of @xmath214 .",

    "+ we calculate the asymptotic quantum current @xmath214 numerically for different values of the third barrier phase @xmath201 and for different initial times @xmath101 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport ] ( a ) . for the case of @xmath203 the hamiltonian possesses parity symmetry and thus according to the previous section the asymptotic current obeys @xmath236 .",
    "if @xmath201 deviates from zero , parity symmetry is absent which allows for a nonzero averaged current .",
    "interestingly , for the shown small values of @xmath201 , it seems that the curve @xmath214 is merely shifted by some constant while the overall shape is approximately independent of @xmath201 .",
    "this also matches the observation concerning the variation of the floquet spectrum for small deviations from a parity symmetric setup ( cf .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ( a ) ) . in this case",
    ", we observed that the spectrum approximately maintains its overall form , but the symmetry axis of the spectrum , which is at @xmath84 for @xmath203 , is shifted to a nonzero @xmath63 for small nonzero @xmath201 . in order to understand how these two observations could be related ,",
    "let us consider only the most populated floquet mode for our initial state of a gaussian wave packet , which for a parity symmetric setup with @xmath203 has zero quasi - momentum . as a crude approximation",
    ", one can argue that for a small deviation from @xmath203 this mode will remain almost unchanged but is shifted to a nonzero quasi - momentum in the same way that the spectrum is .",
    "hence , the mode picks up a momentum which is related to the shift of the spectrum and thus related to the value of @xmath201 .",
    "furthermore , the spectrum is of course independent of the initial time and consequently the shift of the spectrum is the same for every @xmath101 , which by virtue of the previous arguments would explain why the increase of @xmath214 for increasing @xmath201 was to a good approximation independent of @xmath101 . + for larger values of the third barrier phase @xmath201 the simple picture of a merely shifted spectrum is not longer applicable .",
    "the current averaged over the initial time is shown over the entire range of @xmath201 in fig .",
    "[ fig : transport ] ( b ) revealing the more complex behaviour at larger @xmath201 , such as several sign changes of the currents which can not be explained easily be means of simple symmetry arguments .",
    "in fact it was shown in @xcite that the asymptotic quantum current as a function of some system parameter generally features a highly nontrivial dependence .",
    "we have investigated the setup of a quantum particle in a periodic lattice consisting of driven gaussian barriers .",
    "since we allowed for different driving laws which were spatially periodically repeated , we have been able to design lattices with complex unit cells containing differently driven barriers . within the framework of floquet theory",
    ", we presented an efficient numerical scheme that provided us with the floquet - bloch modes for arbitrary quasi - momentum .",
    "for the floquet spectrum we found that the site - dependent driving has remarkable ramifications . a small deviation from a uniform , i.e. site - independent , driving was shown to cast exact crossings into avoided ones while the quasi - energy bands away from the crossings remained approximately unaltered .",
    "the width of the respective avoided crossings could be manipulated by adjusting parameters of the driving law .",
    "because the presence of exact and avoided crossings in the floquet spectrum of driven lattice systems has been shown in the literature to be at the heart of many interesting phenomena , such as resonances in directed particle motion @xcite , the diffusion of a wave packet @xcite , the stimulation of landau - zener transitions via external forces @xcite or even the possibility of an absolute negative mobility @xcite , this control over the crossing s widths as achieved in this work opens up a promising direction of interesting future research .",
    "we could explain the effect of a crossing- to avoided crossing transition as the result of a breaking of the translational symmetry over the distance of two adjacent barriers .",
    "since this effect was shown to be symmetry induced it does in no way depend on the fine tuning of parameters and should be accessible in state of the art cold atom experiments .",
    "promising experimental techniques for the realization of the required breaking of translational invariance are sub - wavelength lattices where modulations below the laser s wavelength can be obtained @xcite .",
    "possible setups which should allow for the phase modulated driving as studied in this work are provided by so called painted potentials where the full control over the motion of each potential barrier is achieved @xcite .",
    "here we showed that directed particle motion can be generated even in situations where each barrier on its own does not break the necessary symmetries . over a certain regime",
    "the resulting currents were shown to be controllable by engineering the asymmetry of the floquet spectrum through parameter variations of the site - dependent driving .",
    "we thank h. schanz for helpful discussions .",
    "the quantities of interest are the matrix elements of the powers of @xmath83 , i.e. we need to compute @xmath237 . for @xmath238",
    "one simply gets @xmath239 due to the orthonormality of the basis vectors . for @xmath240",
    "we obtain @xmath241 matrix representations of higher powers of @xmath83 can be calculated recursively : @xmath242 where we have used the completeness of the product basis as well as eq ..",
    "the fourier coefficients of the potential @xmath96 are to be represented in the basis of @xmath43 .",
    "again we exploit that we can omit the @xmath63-dependence for the operator of the potential energy and the calculation becomes : @xmath243 where we have used the expression for the fourier coefficient from eq . and as before @xmath98 is the potential of a single oscillating barrier . at this point",
    "we make use of the fact that we have restricted ourselves to setups in which the different gaussian barriers have no significant overlap with one another .",
    "hence we can exchange summation and integration and apply the coordinate transformation @xmath244 for each of the @xmath12 integrals : @xmath245",
    "first , we show that the symmetry given in eq . is equivalent to the relation : @xmath246 for the matrix elements of the time evolution operator over the @xmath72th time step as given by eq .",
    "( we omit the dependence on the initial time @xmath101 for the sake of clarity ) and we have adopted the notation @xmath247 from @xcite . as mentioned in the main text , the time evolution operator over an entire period of the driving is obtained as the product of the @xmath70 operators @xmath75 . for reasons of clarity , we will omit the momentum indices @xmath248 for the time being . in analogy ,",
    "the time evolution operator for the time interval @xmath249 is given by : @xmath250 where @xmath251 and @xmath252 are the number of time steps corresponding to @xmath253 and @xmath254 and are given by @xmath255 .",
    "now , if we assume that eq .",
    "holds we find : @xmath256 thus , the symmetry in eq . follows indeed from eq .. however , the validity of eq .",
    "remains to be shown .",

    "we obtain for @xmath258 : @xmath259 here we exploited that @xmath260 , which follows directly from eq . , as well as from the fact that the fourier components of a time reversal symmetric function obey @xmath261 .",
