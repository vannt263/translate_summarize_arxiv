    "the size of a galaxy , as measured by its half - mass radius @xmath8 for example , is among the most basic of its properties .",
    "together with the mass @xmath9 , the size @xmath8 determines the binding energy , @xmath10 , and hence the energy radiated away during the formation of the galaxy . for galactic disks , with stars and gas on nearly circular orbits with rotation velocity @xmath11",
    ", the size @xmath8 is determined by the angular momentum @xmath12 , which in turn determines the energy @xmath13 . the basic description of galaxies in general consists of @xmath9 , @xmath8 , and @xmath11 , or equivalently @xmath9 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , while for disk - dominated galaxies , any two of these quantities suffice .",
    "as a result of the hierarchical growth of galaxies , we expect their masses and radii to increase with cosmic time and thus to decrease with redshift . in the simplest models of galaxy formation ,",
    "the sizes of the baryonic components of galaxies are , on average , proportional to the sizes of their surrounding dark - matter halos . for galactic disks ,",
    "this proportionality in sizes follows directly from the assumed proportionality of the angular momentum of baryons and dark matter resulting from tidal torques in the early stages of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "this assumption underlies all of the many semi - analytical models of galaxy formation in current use ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation confirm the approximate proportionality between the angular momentum of galaxies and their dark - matter halos @xcite .",
    "there have been numerous searches for the expected decrease in galactic sizes with redshift based on measurements of deep images taken with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) over the past dozen years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these searches all find that galaxies were smaller in the past , by roughly the predicted amount , although there are significant differences in the precise decline of galactic sizes with redshift among these studies ( compare e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "part of the discrepancy among these results stems from the fact that the apparent evolution in sizes depends on how galaxies at different redshifts are compared , whether at fixed stellar mass or luminosity or at variable stellar mass or luminosity .",
    "@xcite used stellar - mass  halo - mass ( smhm ) relations derived via the technique of abundance matching to compare the observed sizes of present - day galaxies with the sizes of their matched dark - matter halos in cosmological @xmath16-body simulations .",
    "he found that the sizes of galaxies at @xmath3 are proportional on average to the sizes of their halos .",
    "furthermore , the coefficient of proportionality is consistent with a simple model in which galactic disks grow with approximately the same specific angular momentum as their halos until @xmath17 and then stop growing after that",
    ". the question immediately arises whether the same or a different relation holds between the sizes of galaxies and their halos at high redshifts .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to answer this question .    the advantage of comparing the sizes of galaxies at multiple redshifts with the sizes of their matched halos at the same redshifts , as we do here , is that the results are then expressed directly in simple , physically meaningful terms .",
    "in fact , virtually all predictions of galaxy sizes at high redshifts are based on the assumption that they grow in proportion to halo sizes .",
    "there are already a couple of indications that the sizes of galaxies and their halos evolve in lockstep .",
    "first , semi - empirical models of galaxy formation that make this assumption agree better with deep _",
    "hst_images than the same models with different assumptions about the evolution of galactic sizes @xcite .",
    "second , recent measurements of the sizes and rotation velocities of galactic disks at @xmath18 and @xmath19 indicate that they have approximately the same angular momenta as their dark - matter halos @xcite . while these results are suggestive , it is still important to make a direct , independent comparison of the sizes of high - redshift galaxies with the sizes of their matched halos , the investigation we describe here .",
    "the plan for the remainder of this paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : data ] , we describe our sample of galaxies and measurements of their sizes and other properties . in section [ sec :",
    "matching ] , we discuss the abundance matching method and its implementation with four different stellar mass  halo mass ( smhm ) relations . in section",

    "the size estimates are taken from @xcite .",

    "sources are detected using sextractor @xcite in @xmath52 .",
    "roughly 10% of these sources have high quality spectroscopic redshifts , which are used in calibrating the photometric redshifts for the remaining sources .",
    "galaxy sizes are measured in @xmath52 and @xmath53 by fitting a single srsic profile to each galaxy using galfit @xcite .",
    "we define galaxy sizes as effective radii ( @xmath54 ) along the major axis , the radii within which srsic profiles contain half of the total integrated light .",
    "we discuss the de - projection from 2d to 3d later when comparing with theoretical expectations .",
    "our overall sample is dominated by late - type galaxies at all redshifts , whose disk components have the same 2d and 3d half - light radii .",
    "using simulations with artificial galaxies and comparisons of measurements in different imaging depths , @xcite concluded that down to @xmath55 mag in the candels wide region , the systematic ( random ) errors of @xmath54 measurements are below @xmath720% ( 30% ) .",
    "meanwhile , the systematic ( random ) errors of srsic index @xmath56 measurements are below @xmath750% ( 60% ) .",
    "the quoted errors here are for galaxies with @xmath57 , which tend to have larger errors than galaxies with @xmath58 .",
    "therefore , we select all galaxies down to @xmath55 mag in the candels wide region , @xmath59 mag in the deep region , and @xmath60 mag in the hudf .",
    "these magnitude limits correspond to similar s / n limits .",
    "in addition to magnitude cuts , we prune the sample as follows .",
    "we reject all sources that have problematic photometry ( generally those at the borders of the image or falling on stellar diffraction spikes ) .",
    "we eliminate sources that are identified as agns via x - ray or ir seds .",
    "we discard as point sources all objects that have half - light radii ( measured by sextractor ) smaller than 2.6 pixels .",
    "we enforce the following criteria to eliminate galaxies with poor galfit fits : ( 1 ) the galfit measurement is flagged as poor in the catalogs from @xcite ; ( 2 ) the error in the measured @xmath54 exceeds @xmath61 ; ( 3 ) the measured @xmath56 lies outside the range @xmath62 , which usually signals problematic fits . the galfit , agn , and point - source criteria combined reject roughly @xmath63 of the sources that satisfy the magnitude cuts . the number of sources that pass all the cuts above are listed in table [ tab : sample ] .",
    "the existence of the very deep hudf data allows us to test whether selection effects , measurement biases , or the pruning procedure are biasing our samples near their faint limits . in figure",
    "[ fig : pruning ] ( top panels ) , we compare the size distributions in the wide region and the hudf for the magnitude range @xmath64 before and after pruning , finding no significant difference .",
    "if the hudf were picking up many more low - surface brightness objects , we would have expected to see that show up in the tail of the distribution .",
    "instead we see more large - radius objects in the wide sample , most of which are pruned away as bad fits , but without having much impact on the median @xmath54 .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnoff test yields @xmath65 values consistent with the samples being drawn from the same underlying distribution . figure [ fig : pruning ] shows the same comparison for the deep region in the magnitude range @xmath66 mag .",
    "we made a similar comparison for the stellar mass distributions , also finding no statistically significant difference between the hudf and the deep and wide samples .",
    "the surface brightness detection limits were also presented in @xcite for goods - s ( see their figure 5 . ) at our magnitude limits , we are 90% complete for galaxies smaller than @xmath67 in wide , @xmath68 in deep , and @xmath69 in hudf . figure [ fig : pruning ] shows that the majority of galaxies in our sample are smaller than these limits , so surface brightness detection completeness is not an issue .",
    "studying galaxy size evolution demands that we compare @xmath54 values at a similar rest - frame wavelength across redshift bins , so that we can eliminate the contributions from dust or stellar age gradient to the observed size evolution .",
    "we follow the procedure in @xcite to correct for galaxy color gradients and place galaxy sizes on the same rest - frame wavelength . to do this",
    ", we use galaxy sizes measured in @xmath52 for galaxies at @xmath70 and use the sizes measured in @xmath53 at @xmath71 .",
    "color gradients that lead to different galaxy sizes at different wavelengths are accounted for by a correction factor that is a function of galaxy redshift , stellar mass , and galaxy type ( late - type or early - type ) . as the result of this color gradient correction ,",
    "the measurements are converted into the @xmath54 near rest - frame 5000 .",
    "the size correction is typically only a few per cent , but it does reach @xmath760% in some cases . for more details about the color gradient correction , we refer the readers to @xcite , section 2.2 , and their equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .    stellar masses and star formation rates",
    "are estimated by comparing our photometry with model spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , adopting @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) . here",
    "stellar masses refer to the total mass in stars and stellar remnants at the time of observation , not including the material ejected by stars .",
    "this method of estimating stellar masses has been extensively tested in @xcite , and they found that typical stellar mass uncertainties are @xmath72 dex for the magnitude limits adopted here .",
    "the primary sources of systematic uncertainties are imf and stellar evolution models ; for galaxies with strong nebular emission lines , systematic uncertainties for stellar mass can be up to @xmath73 dex .",
    "we restrict our overall study to galaxies with stellar masses @xmath74 . above this limit",
    ", we include all galaxies down to the magnitude limits mentioned above , where we are confident that our measurements are robust and unaffected by size - dependent biases . for each redshift interval",
    ", we estimate the typical stellar mass of the faintest galaxies by taking the median sed - fitted stellar mass estimate of galaxies within 0.1 mag of the hudf magnitude limit .",
    "the estimated values are listed in table [ tab : sample ] and shown as vertical tick marks on figures [ fig : rr_z0][fig : rr_allz_ssfr ] .",
    "sed - based star formation rates can be uncertain to @xmath75 dex @xcite , therefore the specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) uncertainties are roughly @xmath76 dex for our galaxy sample",
    ". we will only use ssfr to select subsamples in the tails of the ssfr distributions . because we are making a differential comparison between the relatively large populations in these tails , our results are not sensitive to the ssfr uncertainties .",
    "in this study , we employ the technique of abundance matching to estimate the mass and thence the size of the dark - matter halo associated with each galaxy in our sample .",
    "in essence , this technique compares the measured sizes of observed galaxies with the inferred sizes of matched halos in cosmological dark - matter simulations .",
    "the basic assumption is that the rank ordering of galaxy ( stellar ) masses @xmath77 reflects on average the rank ordering of halo ( virial ) masses @xmath78 , i.e. , that the cumulative number densities of galaxy masses and halo masses are equal : @xmath79 .",
    "this ansatz leads directly to a correspondence between @xmath77 and @xmath78 known as the stellar mass  halo mass ( smhm ) relation .",
    "while the assumption that galaxy masses and halo masses follow the same rank ordering is a reasonable approximation for statistical studies based on large samples such as ours , it can not be exactly true for individual galaxies , which experience stochastic events such as mergers and starbursts throughout their histories .    given a smhm relation , we compute the halo mass @xmath78 of each galaxy in our sample from its stellar mass @xmath77 .",
    "we then compute the virial halo radius @xmath80 using the standard formula @xmath81^{1/3},\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath83 . in order to assess how sensitive our results are to the choice of smhm relation ,",
    "we perform all of our calculations with four different smhm relations .",
    "these smhm relations are each calibrated with a @xcite stellar imf and all converted to the same halo mass definition @xmath78 .",
    "they are plotted in figures [ fig : smhm1 ] , [ fig : smhm_gtypes ] , and [ fig : smhm ] and discussed below .",
    "_ smhm relation 1_. we have derived this new smhm relation specifically for this study so that it is as consistent as possible with the candels data set , selection criteria , and sed fitting procedure for our sample of galaxies with size measurements . in particular , we combine the stellar mass function @xmath84 from @xcite with our determination of the halo mass function @xmath85 from the millennium - ii simulation @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived the stellar mass function of galaxies at @xmath86 in three of the five candels fields , using very similar selection criteria and procedure for estimating stellar masses as those for our sample described in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "we compare our stellar masses with those used by @xcite and find no significant offsets with just a small scatter ( @xmath87 dex ) .",
    "they fitted a double schechter function to the observed stellar mass function in differential form @xmath88 in each of eight redshift bins .",
    "we adopt the @xcite results directly for the three bins of width @xmath89 covering the range @xmath90 . however , for simplicity , we combine their results for the four bins of width @xmath91 covering the range @xmath92 into two bins of width @xmath89 . in this step ,",
    "we weight the observed comoving densities of galaxies by the comoving volume in each @xmath91 bin and then fit a double schechter function to the combined comoving densities in each @xmath89 bin . for our lowest redshift bin , @xmath93 , we adopt the @xcite stellar mass function in their lowest redshift bin , @xmath94 , because they have shown that this agrees well with the one at @xmath95 derived by @xcite . finally , we have derived the halo mass function @xmath85 from the millennium - ii simulation @xcite at the snapshot closest to the middle of each redshift bin and then matched this to the stellar mass function as described above to obtain the smhm relation .    as a check on this procedure ,",
    "we have independently derived our own stellar mass function from scratch by the @xmath96 method for the galaxies in all five candels fields in the six @xmath89 bins ( albeit with a approximate @xmath97-corrections in estimating @xmath96 ) .",
    "the resulting stellar mass function is nearly identical to the rebinned one from @xcite .",
    "this adds to our confidence in the validity of smhm relation 1 , which we regard as the primary smhm relation in this study .",
    "because our galaxy sample covers a wider range in stellar mass than that covered by @xcite , we linearly extrapolate the smhm relation in log  log space to both lower and higher masses beyond the range covered by @xcite .",
    "the solid lines in figure [ fig : smhm1 ] show the mass range covered by @xcite , and the dashed lines show the linearly - extrapolated smhm relation .",
    "_ smhm relation 2_. @xcite derived this smhm relation from published stellar mass and halo mass functions over a wide range of redshifts ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "this is probably the most prevalent smhm relation in the literature .",
    "however , since it is based on stellar mass functions that are quite different from those derived using candels data , it is not ideal for the present study .",
    "we use it mainly to gauge the sensitivity of our results to different smhm relations . for consistency , we convert their halo mass @xmath99 , defined using a redshift - dependent overdensity factor @xmath100 @xcite , to our halo mass definition @xmath78 .",
    "the conversion assumes an nfw halo mass profile and the halo mass  concentration model calibrated in @xcite .",
    "the corrections are very small in general ( @xmath101 dex ) .",
    "_ smhm relation 3_. this is the same smhm relation adopted by @xcite .",
    "he derived his own smhm relation out of concerns that previous relations used stellar mass functions that are biased at both the high - mass and low - mass ends . by using the same smhm relation as @xcite",
    ", we can directly compare our galaxy size ",
    "halo size relation with his at @xmath3 .    _",
    "smhm relation 4_. relations were derived separately for blue and red central galaxies at @xmath102 by @xcite using abundance matching .",
    "we use the blue and red smhm relations for galaxies with srsic index @xmath56 below and above 2.5 , respectively .",
    "several smhm relations separated by galaxy type exist in the literature at @xmath103 , and we compare them in figure [ fig : smhm_gtypes ] .",
    "they use different approaches to derive the ratio between stellar masses and halo masses , ranging from abundance matching @xcite to weak lensing @xcite to a mixture of the two methods @xcite .",
    "we adopt the relation from @xcite because it has the largest dynamic range in halo mass , and it is in the middle of the range spanned by all such relations from the literature . like @xcite",
    ", they also defined their halo mass using @xmath100 , so we apply the same halo mass conversion as we did for smhm relation 2 .",
    "we compare the four smhm relations in figure [ fig : smhm ] .",
    "evidently , there are significant discrepancies among these smhm relations , especially the first and second , for which the differences can be up to @xmath104 dex at @xmath105 .",
    "our smhm relation 1 , derived specifically for the candels sample at @xmath2 , shows stronger redshift evolution than smhm relation 2 from @xcite . as already noted",
    ", this difference comes mainly from the different stellar mass functions used as input to these smhm relations .",
    "fortunately , as we show in section [ sec : results ] and [ sec : errors ] , our main scientific results are relatively insensitive to the adopted smhm relation , largely due to the weak dependence of halo size on halo mass ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the main results of this paper are displayed in figures [ fig : rr_z0 ] to [ fig : rr_allz_ssfr ] and described in this section .",
    "the uncertainties in these results , mostly stemming from the smhm relation and morphological classification , are discussed in section [ sec : errors ] .",
    "our first main result is that galaxy sizes are proportional to halo sizes over a wide range of size and mass .",
    "figure [ fig : rr_z0 ] shows galaxy @xmath54 plotted against halo @xmath80 at @xmath93 for the four different smhm relations . in each panel , the medians ( 1684 percentile ranges ) of @xmath107 in @xmath108 bins of width 0.15 dex are plotted as squares ( error bars ) ; only the bins with more than 5 galaxies are shown .",
    "the halo radius limit corresponding to the reference stellar masses @xmath109 in table [ tab : sample ] are shown as a heavy tick mark at the bottom of each panel .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality @xmath110 in the relation @xmath111 is nearly the same in all four cases ; the median values of @xmath110 are 0.021 , 0.025 , 0.023 , and 0.024 for smhm relations 14 , respectively",
    ". these @xmath54@xmath80 relations are approximately linear , but with some subtle differences depending on the adopted smhm relation .",
    "@xcite also found a linear relation , using completely independent samples of galaxies at @xmath102 and de - projected 3d half-_mass _ radii @xmath112 rather than the projected 2d half-_light _ radii @xmath54 .",
    "the solid line in figure [ fig : rr_z0 ] shows his derived relation @xmath113 with @xmath114 , assuming @xmath115 for pure - disk galaxies .",
    "the bulk of our sample by number lies above this relation by @xmath116 dex , agreeing better at the high- and low - mass ends .",
    "there are a number of possible explanations for this offset , one of them being the difference between 2d half - light ( effective ) and 2d half - mass radii .",
    "@xcite noted that for the galaxies more massive than @xmath117 at @xmath118 , rest - frame @xmath119 band 2d half - light radii are on average @xmath725% larger than 2d half - mass radii ( presumably due to the influence of bulges ) , which could account for @xmath87 dex of the offset .",
    "we will address other explanations below in discussing the difference between morphological types , de - projection effects , and the redshift evolution .",
    "our second main result is that the @xmath54@xmath80 relations are offset for late - type and early - type galaxies . to separate morphological types , we split our sample in two different ways : ( 1 ) high-@xmath56 ( early - type ) and low-@xmath56 ( late - type ) subsamples , and ( 2 ) low - ssfr ( early - type ) and high - ssfr ( late - type ) subsamples .",
    "we only include the highest and lowest 20% of the sample in either @xmath56 or ssfr in the hope that this procedure will isloate disk - dominated from spheroid - dominated galaxies .",
    "the resulting @xmath54@xmath80 relations for different morphological types using all four smhm relations are shown in figures [ fig : rr_z0_sersic ] and [ fig : rr_z0_ssfr ] .",
    "we see in both figures [ fig : rr_z0_sersic ] and [ fig : rr_z0_ssfr ] that different morphological types follow sequences roughly parallel to the @xmath120 line with an offset of @xmath6 dex at @xmath93 .",
    "this result is relatively robust against smhm relation and morphological classification method : early - type ( high-@xmath56 or low - ssfr ) galaxies have smaller @xmath54 than late - type ( low-@xmath56 or high - ssfr ) galaxies at the same halo masses .",
    "the effect persists even if we compare 3d half - light radii rather than 2d half - light radii @xmath54 , although with a smaller separation between the sequences .",
    "the parallel sequences of early- and late - type galaxies in the @xmath54@xmath80 diagram is reminiscent of the parallel sequences of spheroid- and disk - dominated galaxies in the @xmath121 vs. @xmath9 diagram @xcite .",
    "the latter is due to a combination of different sizes ( by a factor of @xmath72 ) and different rotation velocities ( also by a factor of @xmath723 ) of spheroid- and disk - dominated galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "this helps explain why our overall relation in figure [ fig : rr_z0 ] is higher than kravtsov s at intermediate masses .",
    "our sample is dominated by late - type galaxies ( @xmath790% have @xmath122 ) , while kravtsov s sample is dominated by early - type galaxies ( @xmath123 by number ) .",
    "he noted that late - type galaxies are systematically larger in @xmath112 than early - type galaxies at intermediate stellar masses , which is where we see the largest offset between these sequences in figure [ fig : rr_z0 ] .",
    "the changing morphological mix as a function of mass also helps explain the apparent curvature of the overall relation in figure [ fig : rr_z0 ] , because early - type galaxies dominate the high- and low - mass ends of the samples .",
    "our third main result is that the @xmath54@xmath80 relation for late - type galaxies is close to the predictions of the simple analytic model of disk formation .",
    "the scale radius and effective radius of an exponential disk embedded in a dark - matter halo with a virial ( outer ) radius @xmath80 and a spin parameter @xmath124 are given by @xmath125 and @xmath126 when the disk and halo have the same specific angular momentum ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : rr_disk ] ) is exact for isothermal halos ( @xcite ; see their figure 3 and equation 42 ; @xcite , see his equation 4 ) and is approximate for nfw halos with typical concentrations @xcite .",
    "this prediction is shown as the dashed lines in figures [ fig : rr_z0_sersic ] to [ fig : rr_allz_ssfr ] for @xmath127 , the peak of the universal spin parameter distribution @xcite .",
    "we find that late - type galaxies at @xmath93 lie @xmath6 dex below the @xmath121 equality line ; in other words , our late - type galaxies have slightly less specific angular momentum than their dark - matter halos .",
    "this offset is consistent with direct measurements of specific angular momentum at @xmath3 , which indicate @xmath121 retention factors @xmath128 for galactic disks @xcite .",
    "our fourth main result is that there is very little evolution in the @xmath54@xmath80 relation from @xmath50 to @xmath3 .",
    "this is shown in figures [ fig : rr_allz_sersic ] and [ fig : rr_allz_ssfr ] .",
    "as in the previous diagrams , we select the highest and lowest 20% tails of the @xmath56 and ssfr distributions . we only show results for smhm relation 1 , but we have checked that they are similar for the other smhm relations .",
    "figures [ fig : rr_allz_sersic ] and [ fig : rr_allz_ssfr ] show again that in all redshift bins , late - type galaxies follow a linear relation : @xmath111 . at @xmath4 ,",
    "late - type galaxies have @xmath129 in figure [ fig : rr_allz_sersic ] ( @xmath130 in figure [ fig : rr_allz_ssfr ] ) and lie close to the @xmath121 equality line ( within @xmath131 0.10.2 dex ) with no discernable evolution .",
    "( there is a slight offset to smaller sizes in the late - type sample when selected by ssfr rather than srsic index . )",
    "this result agrees with recent direct measurements of specific angular momentum at @xmath132 @xcite and at @xmath4 @xcite , which show that @xmath121 in galactic disks is nearly the same as in their dark - matter halos .",
    "@xcite speculated that the sizes of galaxies grew in proportion to the sizes of their halos until @xmath17 and then stopped , while their halos continued to grow in mass and size .",
    "while we see signs of evolution between our lowest redshift bins , both at @xmath133 , the relation for disks seems not to evolve at @xmath35 .",
    "this does not appear consistent with kravtsov s speculation .",
    "we believe we are seeing a real trend in the data at @xmath133 that will require a different physical interpretation .",
    "the interpretation for the relation of early - type galaxies is more uncertain .",
    "we see in figures [ fig : rr_allz_sersic ] and [ fig : rr_allz_ssfr ] that the trend for early type galaxies at all redshifts roughly parallels that for late - type galaxies , but shifted down by @xmath6 dex at @xmath93 and by @xmath7 0.20.3 dex at @xmath134 .",
    "there is a slight hint of a `` turnover '' at the most massive end at @xmath93 , but it is only apparent in the results using smhm relation 2 .",
    "the turnover , if real , could be due to either size - measurement biases ( due to diffuse outer halos surrounding central galaxies in groups and clusters ) or the breakdown of abundance matching for the group- or cluster - mass halos .",
    "how robust are these results ? the uncertainties in this study potentially include measurement and statistical errors internal to the candels dataset as well as external systematic errors from the adopted smhm relations and stellar population models . here",
    "we provide a brief assessment of these uncertainties .    as noted in section [ sec : data ] , errors in the measurements of effective radii @xmath54 ( from fits to srsic profiles ) are relatively small : @xmath135 ( systematic ) to @xmath136 ( random ) .",
    "even if these errors were at the upper end of this range for all galaxies and varied systematically with galactic masses and sizes , they would have a negligible influence on the coefficient and exponent of the galaxy size ",
    "halo size relation : @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( assuming a @xmath140 or smaller systematic deviation in @xmath54 for a factor of 10 or more variation in @xmath80 ) . because the sample size in this study is so large ( @xmath141 ) , the effects of random errors in the size measurements on the mean @xmath54@xmath80 relations are even smaller . in a situation like this , with negligible internal errors , formal tests of goodness - of - fit are not informative , and we do not attempt them .    the dominant uncertainties in our galaxy size ",
    "halo size relations are most likely caused by possible systematic errors in our adopted smhm relations .",
    "we can judge the magnitude of these errors by comparing the @xmath54@xmath80 relations plotted in figures [ fig : rr_z0 ] to [ fig : rr_z0_ssfr ] for the four different smhm relations .",
    "this comparison indicates that the smhm relation may be responsible for systematic errors at the level @xmath87@xmath142 dex , perhaps a little less for the combined sample of galaxies , perhaps a little more for the subsamples split by morphological type .",
    "quantitative measures of the deviations among the @xmath54@xmath80 relations at @xmath93 confirm these impressions .",
    "the contribution to the error budget from the adopted stellar population models , which determine the stellar masses and specific star formation rates , are smaller than those from the adopted smhm relations .",
    "systematic errors in stellar masses could affect the @xmath54@xmath80 relations at about the same level as systematic errors in @xmath54 .",
    "the classification of the 3d shapes of galaxies ( i.e. , flat disks vs. round spheroids ) by srsic index is highly problematic , because it is based only on the radial decline of the projected 2d surface brightness profiles .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath54@xmath80 relations we obtain from subsamples split by srsic index agree at the @xmath143 dex level with those from subsamples split by specific star formation rate .    based on this assessment of uncertainties ,",
    "most of the results of this paper appear to be robust .",
    "in particular , there is a strong , approximately linear correlation between the sizes of galaxies and their dark - matter halos over the full range of redshifts examined here , @xmath2 .",
    "the coefficient of proportionality is larger for late - type galaxies than for early - type galaxies , which follow roughly parallel sequences , except possibly at the highest redshifts . for late - type galaxies ,",
    "the observed @xmath54@xmath80 relation is generally consistent with simple models in which galactic disks grow with the same specific angular momentum as their dark - matter halos .",
    "there is some evidence for a slow - down in disk growth after @xmath144 , but the apparent deviation from the @xmath121 equality line at @xmath5 is only @xmath6 dex and is therefore a marginal rather than a robust detection .",
    "lcccc    \\1 .",
    "the @xmath54@xmath80 relations are roughly linear in all redshift bins .",
    "& t & t & t & t + 2 .",
    "the @xmath54@xmath80 relations are offset for early- and late - type galaxies .",
    "& t & t & t & t + 3 .",
    "the @xmath54@xmath80 relation for late - type galaxies are close to the @xmath121 _ equality _ line .",
    "& t & t & t & t + 4 .",
    "the @xmath54@xmath80 relation shows little evolution between @xmath3 and @xmath50 .",
    "& t & t & t & t    we have plotted and examined the @xmath54@xmath80 relations at all redshifts ( @xmath2 ) for all four smhm relations to determine whether or not they support the four main results discussed in section [ sec : results ] . the outcome of this test is recorded in table [ tab : truth ] by a t ( for true ) or f ( for false ) for each combination of smhm relation and result .",
    "all of the entries are ts .",
    "table [ tab : truth ] therefore reinforces our conclusion that the main scientific results of this study are robust relative to discrepancies among the smhm relations ( because of the weak dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath78 ) .",
    "we have found that the sizes of galaxies are proportional on average to the sizes of their dark - matter halos over a wide range of galaxy and halo masses and over the entire redshift range @xmath2 studied here : @xmath111 with @xmath145 . in particular , we confirm the basic relation found by @xcite at @xmath3 with only minor adjustment , some of which is related to the difference between 2d half - light radii and 3d half - mass radii . there is some curvature at the upper end of our overall @xmath54@xmath80 relation , which is due to the larger abundance and smaller average size of early - type galaxies compared with late - type galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "indeed , we find that early- and late - type galaxies follow distinct , roughly parallel @xmath54@xmath80 relations offset by a factor of @xmath146 for the upper and lower 20 percentiles of srsic index and specific star formation rate , which are meant to be proxies for disk - dominated and spheroid - dominated galaxies .    given the proportionality between galaxy and halo sizes , it is now straightforward to predict how galaxy sizes evolve with redshift , from the following alternative forms of equation ( [ eq : rvir ] ) :    @xmath147^{1/3}=\\alpha\\frac{v_{200c}}{10h(z)}.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath148 is the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath83 , and @xmath149 is the circular velocity of the halo in question ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , we expect @xmath150 or @xmath151 depending on whether galaxies at different @xmath83 are compared at the same @xmath78 or @xmath149 . as a result of gravitational clustering , the characteristic halo mass evolves with redshift roughly as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the rms deviation of the linear density field smoothed over the scale @xmath154 , @xmath155 is the critical linear overdensity for collapse @xcite , and @xmath156 is the linear growth factor @xcite .",
    "the corresponding galactic size @xmath157 at the knee of the galaxy mass function should evolve according to equation ( [ eq : size_evol ] ) with @xmath158 .",
    "this expression for @xmath157 relates the typical sizes of progenitor  descendant pairs of galaxies at different redshifts , although there will be a large dispersion about it as a result of stochasticity in the hierarchical growth of galaxies .",
    "our @xmath54@xmath80 relations for late - type galaxies ( defined by low @xmath56 , high ssfr ) at @xmath4 are within @xmath131 0.10.2 dex of the predictions of simple models in which galactic disks acquire and retain the same specific angular momentum as induced by tidal torques in their surrounding dark - matter halos . at @xmath5 ,",
    "late - type galaxies are @xmath6 dex below this prediction .",
    "however , given possible systematic errors in the measurements of galactic sizes ( @xmath159 for low-@xmath56 galaxies ) , our results are consistent with a range @xmath128 for the retained fraction of specific angular momentum .",
    "our results therefore agree nicely with recent , direct measurements of the specific angular momentum of galactic disks at @xmath3 @xcite , at @xmath19 @xcite , and at @xmath18 @xcite , all of which indicate retention factors @xmath160 near unity or slightly below .",
    "the notion of angular momentum conservation was introduced as a simplifying approximation in the era of analytical models of galaxy formation @xcite . since then",
    ", hydrodynamical models have revealed a much more complex situation .",
    "in particular , it is now clear that several physical processes may change the specific angular momentum of galaxies or parts of galaxies during their formation and evolution , including merging , feedback , inflows , outflows , and gravitational interactions between baryons and dark matter .",
    "some of these processes cause gains in specific angular momentum , while others cause losses ( see @xcite and @xcite for summaries and references to earlier work ) .",
    "the galactic disks that form in recent hydrodynamical simulations have nearly the same specific angular momentum on average as their dark - matter halos , in good agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "evidently , the processes responsible for gains and losses are either weak or in rough balance , leading to an apparent ( if not strict ) conservation of angular momentum during the formation of galactic disks .",
    "simulations and now observations indicate that galaxies of all types grow in a quasi - homologous ( or self - similar ) relationship with their dark - matter halos .",
    "the details of how this happens are a topic of ongoing research .",
    "+ we thank gerard lemson for the help with millennium simulation , adam tomczak for useful discussions of stellar mass functions , and andrey kravtsov for providing conversion factors between different halo mass definitions .",
    "we also thank avishai dekel , sandra faber , steve finkelstein , andrey kravtsov , yu lu , and rachel somerville for comments on a near - final draft of this paper .",
    "this work is based on observations taken by the candels multi - cycle treasury program with the nasa / esa hst , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "[ sec : appendix ]    the halo virial radius @xmath80 of each galaxy in our sample was computed by the abundance - matching technique , i.e. , from its stellar mass @xmath161 , the smhm relation , and equation ( [ eq : rvir ] ) .",
    "thus , the positions of galaxies in the @xmath54@xmath80 plane represent a non - linear transformation of their positions in the @xmath54@xmath161 plane . while the former is more fundamental from a theoretical perspective , and is the main focus of this paper , the latter is one step closer to the observations , since it requires only the conversion of luminosities and colors into stellar masses .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine the @xmath54@xmath161 diagrams for our sample and how they map into the @xmath54@xmath80 diagrams presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "this is the purpose of this appendix .",
    "figure [ fig : rm_comp ] shows the @xmath54@xmath161 diagram for galaxies in our sample in six redshift intervals covering the range @xmath49 when divided , as before , into subsamples with the lowest and highest quintiles of srsic index @xmath56 .",
    "we also plot in this diagram the median values of @xmath54 in bins of width 0.5 in @xmath162 for these two subsamples . evidently , the median @xmath54@xmath161 relation for low-@xmath56 galaxies is close to a single power law ( a straight line in a plot of @xmath107 against @xmath162 ) , whereas the relation for high-@xmath56 galaxies is more complicated ; it is flatter than the low-@xmath56 relation at low masses and steeper at high masses , with a bend at @xmath163 .",
    "it is also clear from figure [ fig : rm_comp ] that the median @xmath54@xmath161 relations for both low-@xmath56 and high-@xmath56 galaxies evolve very slowly . for subsamples with the highest and lowest quintiles of specific star formation rate",
    ", we find similar behaviors in the median @xmath54@xmath161 relations , as functions of both @xmath161 and @xmath83 , especially for @xmath164 ( not shown here ) .",
    "figure [ fig : rr_comp ] shows the result of transforming the @xmath54@xmath161 diagram into the @xmath54@xmath80 diagram with smhm relation 1 .",
    "this is exactly the same as figure [ fig : rr_allz_sersic ] except that we have omitted the vertical bars for clarity .",
    "we have already discussed this diagram at length in section [ sec : results ] . here",
    "we note only that the median @xmath54@xmath80 relations for low-@xmath56 and high-@xmath56 galaxies in figure [ fig : rr_comp ] appear more parallel than the corresponding @xmath54@xmath161 relations in figure [ fig : rm_comp ] , particularly at @xmath164 , where they are best defined .",
    "this is a consequence of the non - linearity of the smhm relation , especially near @xmath165 , corresponding to @xmath163 , and hence near the bend in the @xmath54@xmath161 relation for high-@xmath56 galaxies .",
    "@xcite also derived @xmath54@xmath161 relations in the redshift range @xmath49 for galaxies in the candels sample .",
    "the main difference between their work and ours is that they adopted the same selection limits in all candels regions , whereas we adopted fainter selection limits in the deep and hudf regions . as a result",
    ", our @xmath54@xmath161 relations extend to much lower @xmath161 than theirs .",
    "otherwise , the selection of galaxies and measurement of their properties are nearly identical in the two studies .",
    "@xcite divided their sample into blue and red galaxies on the basis of rest - frame @xmath166 colors rather than by srsic index or specific star formation rate , as we have done . naturally , there is a general , but not a perfect , correspondence between these three different proxies for late- and early - type galaxies .",
    "@xcite fitted power laws to the @xmath54@xmath161 relations for blue and red galaxies ; these are shown in figure [ fig : rm_comp ] as the blue solid and red dashed line segments , respectively .",
    "for red galaxies , they truncated the fits at @xmath167 because they also noticed a bend in the @xmath54@xmath161 relation near this mass and a flattening below it .",
    "we obtain nearly identical results when we divide our sample into blue and red galaxies using the same cuts in rest - frame @xmath166 colors as @xcite .",
    "the blue solid and red dashed curves in figure [ fig : rr_comp ] show how the @xcite power laws in the @xmath54@xmath161 diagram transform into the @xmath54@xmath80 diagram . as expected , this mapping introduces curvature and makes the @xmath54@xmath80 relations for blue and red galaxies somewhat more parallel .",
    "however , the transformed relations cover only a narrow range of halo sizes , roughly @xmath168 , except in the lowest redshift interval .",
    "we have been able to extend the @xmath54@xmath80 relations to a wider range of halo sizes , roughly @xmath169 , with our fainter selection limits in the candels deep and hudf regions .",
