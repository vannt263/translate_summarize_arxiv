    "the nonlocal process present in quantum teleportation is also considered to play a role@xcite .",
    "more recently , it was speculated that if the collapsing matter and incoming hawking particle at the black hole singularity@xcite are maximally entangled , information can escape from a black hole as a process similar to the quantum teleportation .",
    "this scenario , unfortunately , is likely flawed by the interaction between the collapsing matter and the incoming hawking flux@xcite , in the case of the qubit teleportation assuming the random unitary interaction between the original state and one of the entangled pair@xcite , however , nearly perfect information can be restored with proper encoding after quantum error correction .",

    "if we ignore the interaction of bob s state with the vacuum , we obtain @xmath328 and quantum teleportation can still be viewed as successful .",
    "proper encoding of the message with quantum error correction may help retrieving the complete information .",
    "if we take into account the interaction with vacuum for all three parties , we obtain @xmath329 , thus quantum teleportation is no longer successful .    implications of our results to black hole information problem can be summarized as follows .",
    "there are two fundamental sources of nonunitary evolutions and information loss .",
    "( 1 ) the boundary condition of the evolution of the total system ( intrinsic loss ) . ( 2 )",
    "the interaction of the relevant quantum mechanical system with the surrounding quantum field ( induced loss ) .",
    "( 1 ) can be attributed in the laboratory to the special choice of boundary conditions imposed by measurement .",
    "( 2 ) is present in any spacetime and responsible for the quantum / classical correspondence of quantum systems of large degrees of freedom@xcite . in a black hole spacetime",
    ", the singularity provides an effective boundary on the quantum state of infalling matter and the incoming hawking particle .",
    "the origin of nonunitary evolution in ( 1 ) may be explained by the remnants or wormholes@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) is also present as the interaction among infalling matter , hawking particles , and gravitational field of a black hole .",
    "thus in addition to the correlation in a hawking pair , there is the induced three - body correlation and tripartite entanglement between the matter and a hawking pair , which vary dynamically due to gravitational interaction . in the practical",
    "setting of the laboratory , there are many other phenomenological loss of information such as photon loss during the optical transmission , leakage , etc .",
    "we did not consider these effects in this work .    at the present stage without complete knowledge of quantum gravity , we do not know details about the final state of the black hole . assuming a maximally entangled final state , we may retrieve quantum information from a black hole just as in quantum teleportation as suggested in @xcite provided that ( i ) the induced loss due to vacuum is negligible . since the environment is always present , this type of loss is unavoidable .",
    "( ii ) the proper postselection is performed .",
    "this can be viewed as an extension of the time - neutral formulation of quantum mechanics@xcite applied to spacetime physics , in which both initial and final states are specified .",
    "decoherence history interpretation of the formulation in view of cosmology is given in @xcite .",
    "in the meantime , performing the postselection in the laboratory is now very common in quantum information science .",
    "we hope our attempts using accelerated observers provide a practical setting to understand the black hole information problem .",
