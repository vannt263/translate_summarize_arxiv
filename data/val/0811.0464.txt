    "the realistic world is affected by randomness . unlike non - random systems , those with randomness sometimes show rich and complicated phenomena . one of the interesting issues for such random systems is spin glass .",
    "many studies mainly by the mean - field analysis have been successful to elucidate various concepts for understanding spin glasses @xcite .",
    "one of the current issues in spin glasses is their nature in finite dimensions below the upper critical dimension .",
    "unfortunately , for finite dimensions , we often rely on numerical simulations , because there are few ways to analytically study spin glasses in finite dimensions .",
    "we need long equilibration times for the numerical simulations for spin glasses and average over many realizations of random systems to make error bars small enough .",
    "it is thus difficult to give conclusive understanding on nature of spin glasses in finite dimensions .",
    "to establish reliable analytical theories of spin glasses has been one of the most challenging problems for years .",
    "a part of successful analyses to elucidate properties on spin glasses is by the use of the gauge symmetry . by use of the gauge symmetry ,",
    "one can obtain the exact value of the internal energy , evaluate the upper bound for the specific heat , and obtain some correlation inequalities in a subspace known as the nishimori line hn81,rev3 .",
    "this gauge symmetry also enables us to rewrite the free energy along the nishimori line as the entropy for the distribution of frustration @xcite .",
    "many aspects on spin glasses are essentially related with frustration .",
    "therefore we expect the possibility that a basis of establishment of a systematic approach to spin glasses would be in the gauge symmetry .",
    "a recent related development with the gauge symmetry is the _ conjecture _ to predict the location of the multicritical point , which is the special point lying on the intersection between phase boundaries and the nishimori line as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite .     ising model on two - dimensional lattice ( left panel ) and on higher dimensions ( right panel ) .",
    "the vertical axis expresses the temperature @xmath6 , and the horizontal line denotes the concentration @xmath7 of the antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the multicritical point is described by the black point ( mcp ) .",
    "the nishimori line is described by the dashed line . for higher dimensions , not only the ferromagnetic ( fm ) and paramagnetic phases ( pm ) but also the spin glass phase ( sg ) exists.,width=283 ]",
    "the predictions by the conjecture have shown agreement with numerical estimations roughly with precision to the third digit .",
    "the conjecture has opened a way of a general scheme for determination of the location of the multicritical points for spin glasses on any self - dual lattices and mutually dual pairs of lattices .",
    "nevertheless it has been found that the conjecture on several mutually dual pairs of hierarchical lattices does not always give predictions in agreement with estimations by the renormalization group analysis @xcite .",
    "such discrepancies are not negligible , because the renormalization group analysis on hierarchical lattices gives exact solutions . to construct a more reliable technique ,",
    "we have improved the technique leading to the location of the multicritical point by combining the concepts of the renormalization group analysis with the duality @xcite .",
    "the improvement for hierarchical lattices has greatly succeeded as seen in the literature , because the discrepancies between the predictions by the improved technique and the exact estimations by the renormalization group analysis actually decrease .",
    "reconsidering the improved technique on the hierarchical lattices , in this paper , we apply the improved technique to the regular lattices such as the square , triangular , and hexagonal lattices .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the conventional conjecture and take a look at several published predictions .",
    "in addition , the problem on the conjecture is pointed out here .",
    "the improved technique on the regular lattices is proposed after review of the case on the hierarchical lattices in sec .",
    "iii , and formulated in sec .",
    "iv . the improved version shows a very close relationship with the entropy of the distribution of frustration as shown in this section . in sec .",
    "v , we carry out the explicit calculations by the improved technique for the regular lattices . moreover we have to carefully evaluate the performance of the improved technique , comparing their predictions with the existing results .",
    "we examine the correspondence with the domany s exact result domany1,domany2 of the slope of the critical point on the phase diagram .",
    "the conclusion is in the last section of the present paper , sec .",
    "it will be useful to review the analysis by the duality , for the conjecture is established by combination of the duality and the replica method nn , mnn .",
    "the duality is one of the tools to identify the transition points for various types of classical spin systems such as the ising model , and the potts model by use of a symmetry embedded in the partition function @xcite .",
    "we take the non - random ising model on the square lattice as an example .",
    "the partition function is given as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the ising spin taking @xmath10 and the product with the subscript @xmath11 is over the nearest neighboring sites .",
    "we can regard this partition function as the multi - variable function of components of the edge boltzmann factor . in this case",

    "we consider that the dependence on @xmath13 emerges through this edge boltzmann factors .",
    "we set two components as @xmath14 and @xmath15 for convenience .",
    "the component @xmath16 is often called the principal boltzmann factor , which is defined by the edge boltzmann factor for the state with all edge spins parallel the principal boltzmann factor is an important component throughout this paper .",
    "the duality is carried out by the fourier transformation for this edge boltzmann factor defined on each bond of the lattice @xcite .",
    "the two - component fourier transformation gives the dual edge boltzmann factors as , @xmath17 as a result , we establish the relation between the partition functions with different components as , @xmath18 we here extract two principal boltzmann factors @xmath19 and @xmath20 to measure the energy from the state with edge spins on each bond being parallel as , @xmath21 where @xmath22 stands for the number of bonds , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are called the relative boltzmann factors defined as @xmath25 and @xmath26 . each partition function",
    "is now reduced to a single - variable function of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , whose explicit forms are , @xmath27 being very well known , the duality relation can be given as @xmath28 to think of the dual partition function as one of another ising model with the edge boltzmann factor @xmath29 .",
    "we can identify the critical point as a fixed point of the duality as @xmath30 , under the assumption of a unique transition . on this critical point , an appealing equation is satisfied @xmath31 .",
    "we consider the case of the random - bond ising model and review the conventional conjecture @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian is defined by @xmath32 where @xmath33 denotes the quenched random coupling and the summation is over the nearest neighboring sites . though various types of distribution for @xmath33 can be considered , we here restrict ourselves to the @xmath0 ising model for convenience . the distribution function for the @xmath0 ising model",

    "we describe schematically the relationship two reduced partition functions @xmath46 as the curves of the relative boltzmann factors @xmath47 ( the thin curve going through the multicritical point @xmath2 ) and @xmath48 ( the dashed line ) as in fig .",

    "then the corresponding dual point @xmath53 moves along the dashed line in the opposite direction from p to f ( the low - temperature limit ) .",
    "these features have been shown rigorously and imply the existence of the duality relation for the temperature @xcite .",
    "if two curves describing change of @xmath54 and @xmath48 become completely coincident with each other , we can obtain a relation @xmath55 . solving this relation ,",
    "we obtain the duality relation for the temperature @xmath56 .",
    "the well - known duality relation @xmath28 for the non - random ising model can be indeed derived from the relation @xmath57 .",

    "[ trajectory ] . in the case for the replicated @xmath58 ising model",
    ", we can neither find a duality relation for the temperature explicitly , nor identify the multicritical point as the fixed point of duality .",
    "we thus have provided a hypothesis on determination of the multicritical point @xcite .",
    "we assume that the equation @xmath59 is also satisfied at the multicritical point , similarly to the non - random bond ising model at the critical point , for any @xmath39-replicated systems including the quenched system ( @xmath60 ) @xcite .",
    "validity of this hypothesis can be rigorously shown for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and for @xmath63 , and has been numerically confirmed for the @xmath64 case of the replicated @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice within error bars of the numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "relying on these facts , we assume that we can predict the location of the multicritical point for the @xmath0 ising model on the square lattice by the single equation @xmath65 .",
    "the quenched limit @xmath60 for this equation yields @xcite , @xmath66 the solution to this equation is @xmath67 .",
    "we can also predict the location of the multicritical point for other types of randomness .",
    "for instance , that of the gaussian ising model with the mean @xmath68 and the variance @xmath69 is given as @xmath70 @xcite .",
    ".comparisons among the results derived by the conventional conjecture and the existing numerical results .",
    "sq denotes the square lattice , tr means the triangular lattice , and hex means the hexagonal lattice . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the estimated values for the square lattice shows convergence to the exact solution @xmath71 @xcite , similarly to the case for the @xmath0 ising model .",
    "in addition , we remark that the improved technique works very well for the critical points of the bond - diluted @xmath72-state potts model , and @xmath72-state villain model @xcite . from these points of view",
    ", we conclude that the improved technique is also a systematic approach leading to the precise locations of the critical points in broader classes of the random spin systems .",
    "we proposed an improved technique applicable to the square , triangular , hexagonal lattices , and derived the precise locations of the multicritical points for the @xmath0 ising model , the gaussian ising model , and the potts spin glass on the square lattice , as well as the @xmath0 ising model on the triangular lattice and the hexagonal lattice .",
    "this improved technique is still approximation for the location of the multicritical point .",
    "however we can enhance the precision of the approximation by the summation over spins in the cluster taken from the considered lattice , if we need the precise location of the critical points in a random spin system .",
    "this would open a way to analytically derive the location of the critical points in random spin systems with very high precision .",
    "unfortunately , in the low - temperature region under the nishimori line , the improved technique can not give satisfactory answers yet .",
    "we solve this problem in the low - temperature region under the nishimori line , and have to examine the validity of some hypotheses on the improved technique .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the random spin systems in two - dimensional systems .",
    "however we can apply the duality to other dimensional systems .",
    "for example , the duality can transform the random - bond ising model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice into the random - plaquette gauge model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the random - plaquette gauge model is an attractive one in terms of the quantum toric code dklp , whp .",
    "an accuracy threshold to correct error of the quantum toric code corresponds to the location of the multicritical point on the random - plaquette gauge model with the random couplings following the @xmath0 distribution function on the three - dimensional cubic lattice .",
    "the conventional conjecture relates this threshold with the location of the multicritical point of the @xmath0 ising model on the three - dimensional cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "the improved technique also can not directly derive such an accuracy threshold , but can make more precise relationship between the locations of the multicritical points on the random - bond ising model and the random - plaquette gauge model .    as another direction of studies in the future",
