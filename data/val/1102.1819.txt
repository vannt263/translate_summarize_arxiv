    "the study of quantum phase transition is a central issue in modern condensed matter physics .",
    "it is widely believed that the ginzburg - landau - wilson theory for classical phase transition may fail to describe the quantum phase transition as a result of the quantum interference effect between classical paths(the berry phase effect ) .",
    "recently , the concepts of quantum order and de - confined quantum criticality are put forward theoretically . on the experimental side , the study of quantum phase transition plays an important role in areas ranging from high - tc cuprates , heavy fermion systems , to the cold atom systems@xcite .",
    "the bilayer heisenberg model(bhm ) on square lattice is a standard model for the study of quantum phase transition . with the increase of the interlayer coupling(@xmath3 ) over the intralayer coupling(@xmath4 ) , the ground state of the system evolves from a state with antiferromagnetic long rang order to a quantum disordered state through a continuous phase transition .",
    "much theoretical and numerical efforts have been devoted to the study of this quantum phase transition .    on theoretical side , perturbative calculations starting from both the ordered side(spin wave expansion)@xcite and the disordered side(the bond operator expansion)@xcite",
    "have been applied to the system . however , due to the biased nature of pertubative methods , none of them can give an accurate description of the system in the near vicinity of the quantum phase transition .",
    "the problem is also treated with the schwinger boson mean field theory@xcite .",
    "although the theory does predict a phase transition between the antiferromagnetic ordered state and the quantum disordered state , the nature of the transition is incorrect .",
    "the mean field theory predicts a discontinues dimerization transition around @xmath5 into a state composed of independent interlayer dimers , while in the real system , the intralayer correlation is nonzero for any finite @xmath6 .    on numerical side ,",
    "the model is thoroughly studied by a variety of methods including the high temperature series expansion@xcite and the quantum monte carlo simulation(stochastic series expansion)@xcite .",
    "these numerical works confirm the existence of the quantum critical point around @xmath7 .",
    "the critical exponents is found to be consistent with that of the classical 3d heisenberg universality class , indicating the irrelevance of the berry phase effect in this phase transition .",
    "as the quantum phase transition occurs at zero temperature , it is natural to find a description of it in terms of an explicit ground state wave function .",
    "the variational approach to quantum phase transition has the virtue that it focus directly on the zero temperature behavior of the system and provides much more detailed information on the quantum critical behavior . in this regard ,",
    "a rvb - type variational wave function@xcite had been applied to the study of the quantum phase transition in the bhm .",
    "the wave function is derived from gutzwiller projection of schwinger boson mean field ground state .",
    "it is well known that such a rvb wave function can describe both the magnetic ordered and the quantum disordered state .",
    "thus , it has the potential to provide an unbiased description of the quantum phase transition in bhm .",
    "the same type of variational wave function has been successfully applied to the study of the single layer two - dimensional heisenberg model@xcite . however , for the bhm , the variational calculation in @xcite using such a wave function predicts a critical coupling @xmath8 , which is a very bad estimate as compared to the result of numerical simulation . a central issue to be addressed in this paper is to understand why the bosonic rvb state , which works so well on square lattice , fails for the bhm and how to improve it .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a rvb - type variational wave function with two variational parameters for the bhm .",
    "similar to @xcite , our wave function is derived from gutzwiller projected schwinger boson mean field state .",
    "however , in our theory the intralayer rvb pairing and interlayer rvb pairing are treated as two independent variational parameters , rather than been determined by mean field self - consistent equations .",
    "we find our variational wave function provides an accurate description of the quantum phase transition of the bhm .",
    "we find the the transition is continuous . by analyzing the spin structure factor , ground state fidelity susceptibility and binder moment ratio @xmath0 ,",
    "the critical coupling strength is estimated to be @xmath9 , in good agreement with those determined from the numerical simulation .",
    "the critical exponent estimated from the scaling analysis of the @xmath0 data is also consistent wit that of the classical 3d heisenberg universality class .",
    "our result indicates that the bosonic rvb wave function derived from gutzwiller projection of the schwinger boson mean field state can provides accurate description of the quantum phase transition in quantum antiferromagnets .",
    "we also find that the failure of the schwinger boson mean field theory originates from the overestimation of the tendency to form interlayer dimers , which is again caused by the relaxation of the no double occupancy constraint .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the bhm and the bosonic rvb wave function . in section iii , we present the numerical method to do calculation on such wave functions . in section iv ,",
    "we present the numerical results and determine the critical point of the phase transition by analyzing the results of fidelity susceptibility and binder moment ratio . in section",
    "v , we present a discussion on related issues and conclude this paper .",
    "the model(bhm ) we study in this paper is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the spin operator at site @xmath12 of layer @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 means the summation over nearest - neighboring sites on the square lattice of each layer .",
    "@xmath15 is the only dimensionless parameter of the model .",
    "when @xmath16 , the model describes two decoupled two - dimensional heisenberg model , each of which are antiferromagnetic ordered at zero temperature . when @xmath17 , the system reduces to n decoupled interlayer dimers and the system is in a trivial quantum disordered state",
    "a continuous quantum phase transition connects these two limits .",
    "earlier numerical simulation shows that the phase transition occurs around @xmath18@xcite .",
    "the bosonic rvb wave function we will adopt in this study is made of coherent superposition of spin singlet configurations on the lattice and can be written as @xmath19 in which @xmath20 denotes the spin singlet pair between site @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 are the coefficients of the coherent superposition . in our case , @xmath23 can be written in a factorizeable form @xmath24    the wave function eq.(2 ) can be used directly as variational state for quantum antiferromagnet . a more efficient and intuitively more attractive way to generate the rvb wave function",
    "is by gutzwiller projection of schwinger boson mean field state .",
    "this approach is used to study two - dimensional heisenberg model and is proved to be very successful .",
    "however , direct application of the approach to the bhm results in unsatisfactory results .    here",
    ", we will adopt the form of the gutzwiller projected schwinger boson mean field state , but regard the mean field order parameters(intralayer and interlayer rvb pairing amplitudes ) as free variational parameters , rather than been determined from the mean field self - consistent equations .",
    "the reason for such a choice is as follows . in the mean field treatment , the no double occupancy constraint is relaxed . as a result , the quantitative prediction of the mean field theory is not reliable .",
    "for example , the mean field equation predicts an un - physical dimerization transition for bhm at @xmath25 , whose origin can be traced back to the overestimation the tendency to form interlayer dimers , which is again related to the relaxation of the local constraint .    in the schwinger boson representation@xcite ,",
    "the spin operator is written as @xmath26 in which @xmath27 is a boson operator , @xmath28 is the pauli matrix .",
    "eq.(3 ) is a faithful representation of the spin algebra provided that the bosonic particle satisfy the no double occupancy constraint @xmath29 the bhm written in terms of the schwinger boson operators reads @xmath30 in which @xmath31 denote the intralayer and interlayer rvb pairing operator , @xmath32 .",
    "the largrange multiplier @xmath33 is introduced to keep track of the local constraint .    in the mean field theory ,",
    "we treat @xmath34 as a constant and decouple the interaction term using the following mean field order parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the mean field hamiltonian reads(up to a constant ) @xmath37    the mean field ground state of eq.(7 ) reads @xmath38 \\bigl|0\\bigr\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath39 denotes the vacuum of the schwinger boson .",
    "@xmath40 represents the rvb amplitude between site @xmath12 in @xmath41 layer and site @xmath42 in @xmath43 layer . as a result of the bipartite nature of the system , the rvb amplitude is nonzero only for sites belonging to different sublattices .",
    "thus for @xmath44 , @xmath40 is nonzero only when @xmath45 have different parity , while for @xmath46 the reverse is true .",
    "the intralayer and interlayer rvb amplitudes are given by(@xmath47 by symmetry ) @xmath48\\exp(i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_{i , j})\\nonumber\\\\      a_{i1,j2}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{\\vec{k}}[\\xi(k)-\\eta(k)]\\exp(i\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}_{i , j}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath49 here @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the bosonic rvb wave function adopted in this study is given by gutzwiller projection of the mean field ground state into the physical subspace satisfying the local constraint , @xmath53^{n/2}\\bigl|0\\bigr\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath54 denotes the gutzwiller projection and @xmath55 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the mean field ground state contains two dimensionless parameters , namely @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in the mean field theory ,",
    "both of them are determined by the mean field self - consistent equations . here",
    "we regard them as two independent variational parameters .",
    "this is the key difference between our theory and that of @xcite .",
    "the proposed wave function eq.(10 ) can describe both the magnetic ordered and the quantum disordered state . as can be seen from eq.(9 ) , as @xmath58 , both @xmath59 and @xmath60 becomes long ranged and the wave function describes a state with antiferromagnetic long range order . on the other hand , when @xmath61 deviates from 1 ,",
    "the rvb amplitudes @xmath59 and @xmath60 become short ranged and the corresponding wave function describes a quantum disordered state .",
    "in fact , @xmath62 is nothing but the bose condensation condition in the mean field theory .    on general grounds",
    ", we expect the interlayer pairing @xmath57 to increase with @xmath63 and the intralayer pairing @xmath56 to decrease with @xmath63 .",
    "the transition between the antiferromagnetic ordered state and the quantum disordered state is signaled by the deviation of @xmath61 from 1 .",
    "these expectations are confirmed in the numerical calculation .",
    "the bosonic rvb wave function eq.(10 ) can be studied by the standard loop gas monte carlo algorithm@xcite . in this algorithm ,",
    "the calculation of expectation value of a physical quantity @xmath64(for example the energy ) is done as follows @xmath65 here @xmath66 denotes the valence bond basis vector and is given by @xmath67 .",
    "@xmath68 is the corresponding amplitude and is given by @xmath69 .",
    "the overlap between two valence bond basis vectors @xmath66 and @xmath70 can be graphically interpreted as a loop gas on the lattice by fusing the valence bonds in the two basis vectors .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the number of loops in the transition graph between @xmath66 and @xmath70 .",
    "as the system is bipartite , the rvb amplitude @xmath59 and @xmath60 are in fact positive definite and the wave function eq.(10 ) satisfy the marshall sign rule@xcite .",
    "for this reason , we can interpret @xmath73 as a normalized probability in the space of loop gas and can draw samples on it with the standard monte carlo method .",
    "the calculation of @xmath74 is easy for @xmath75 and the result reads @xmath76 thus both the energy and spin structure factor can be easily calculated with the standard monte carlo procedure in the loop gas space .    to determine the optimal value of the variational parameter @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    ", we calculate the expectation value of the energy and of its gradients in the parameter space @xmath77 on a finite lattice .",
    "it is useful to note that the gradients of energy can be directly simulated by the loop gas monte carlo method also .",
    "its expression is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes average over the loop gas configurations with the weight @xmath80 .",
    "we have used @xmath81 samples to calculate the energy and its gradients to determine the optimized values for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the boundary condition of the finite lattice is set to be periodic in both directions .",
    "the calculation is done on a lattice with size up to @xmath82 , at which we find the critical coupling converges to @xmath9 .",
    "the optimized value for the parameter @xmath56 and @xmath57 as functions of the coupling constant @xmath63 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "as @xmath63 increases , the interlayer rvb pairing strength @xmath57 increases at the expense of the intralayer rvb pairing strength @xmath56 .",
    "the result is obtained on a @xmath82 lattice .",
    "it is found that the optimized values deviate significantly from the mean field predictions , especially for large value of @xmath63 .",
    "for example , the mean field theory predicts that @xmath83 would reach twice the value of @xmath84 around @xmath85 .",
    "however , the variational theory predicts that @xmath83 is slightly smaller than @xmath84 around @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the mean field theory overestimates greatly the tendency to form interlayer dimer at large @xmath63 .     and @xmath57 as functions of the coupling constant @xmath63.,width=302 ]    to better understand the evolution of the variational parameters as functions of @xmath63 , we plot the value of the @xmath86 as a function of @xmath63 in fig.2 . as we have shown above , the quantum phase transition between the magnetic ordered state and the quantum disordered state in our variational theory is solely controlled by the value of @xmath87 . the value of @xmath87 is seen to deviate from unity around @xmath88 , at which the bose condensate of the spinon is gone .    , which controls the order - disorder transition of bhm .",
    ", width=302 ]    to further characterize the quantum phase transition and determine the value of the critical coupling @xmath89 , we study the following three kinds of quantities : the spin structure factor at the ordering wave vector , the fidelity susceptibility of the ground state and the binder moment ratio @xmath0 .      for a finite system",
    ", the spontaneous magnetization can be defined in a spin rotational invariant way as the square root of the spin structure factor at the magnetic bragg vector .",
    "for bhm , the bragg vector is @xmath90 .",
    "the spin structure factor is defined as @xmath91 for @xmath92 , we have @xmath93 in the quantum disordered state , as the spin correlation length is finite , @xmath94 is of order one .",
    "however , in the magnetic ordered state , @xmath94 should scale like @xmath55 and thus @xmath95 is an extensive quantity .",
    "the result of the spin structure factor for a @xmath82 system is shown in fig.3 .",
    "an order - disorder transition can be seen around @xmath96 .",
    "however , the signature of phase transition in the spin structure factor is not sharp enough for an accurate determination of the critical coupling strength .",
    "the transition is rounded into a crossover as a result of the finite size effect .",
    "for this reason , we need some other quantities that are more sensitive to the transition to determine the critical coupling .     for a system with @xmath97.,width=302 ]      the concept of fidelity susceptibility is introduced to describe the sensitivity of the ground state to the variation of the parameters in hamiltonian@xcite and is expected to reach its maximum at the critical coupling of a quantum phase transition , where the ground state is the most susceptible to the variation of the controlling parameters of the phase transition .",
    "the fidelity susceptibility is defined in the following manner for a system with only one parameter @xmath63 , @xmath98 denotes the overlap between the normalized ground state vector for parameter value @xmath63 and @xmath99 .    in our variational theory ,",
    "the fidelity susceptibility can be calculated directly .",
    "we first fit the optimized variational parameters as functions of @xmath63 and then calculate the overlap between variational ground states for nearby values of @xmath63 .",

    "it is found that the peak position converges rapidly to its thermodynamic limit value @xmath104 when @xmath105 .     and @xmath106 as functions of @xmath63 .",
    "the finite difference used to calculate the fidelity susceptibility is @xmath101.,width=302 ]     determined from the peak position of the fidelity susceptibility .",
    "the peak position is seen to converge rapidly to its thermodynamic limit when @xmath105 .",
    "the error bars are smaller than the size of the symbols.,width=302 ]     for @xmath107 and @xmath106 as functions of @xmath63.,width=302 ]      to confirm the result derived from the fidelity susceptibility , we calculate the binder moment ratio @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the binder moment ratio @xmath0 is a dimensionless quantity defined in the following manner , @xmath108 in which @xmath109 .",
    "note our definition of @xmath0 is slightly different from the standard one in that it is defined in a spin rotational invariant way , while in the standard definition only the @xmath110-component of the moment is used .",
    "the binder moment ratio is very useful in the analysis of the critical properties as it is universal near the critical point .",
    "more specifically , it can be expressed as a universal scaling function of @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath43 is the critical exponent for correlation length .",
    "the results of @xmath0 for system with @xmath107 and @xmath106 are shown in fig.6 .",
    "it is found that all curves cross with each other at approximately the same value of @xmath63 , in accordance with the scaling hypothesis .",
    "the estimated value of the critical coupling strength is @xmath113 , in good agrement with that estimated from the fidelity susceptibility data . the @xmath0 value at the crossing point is found to be approximately @xmath114 , close but smaller than the value(1.29 ) estimated from the quantum monte carlo simulation with the standard definition of @xmath0 .",
    "such a difference may be caused by the difference in the definitions of @xmath0 .",
    "data for @xmath107 and @xmath106 . here",
    "@xmath115,width=302 ]    fig.7 shows the scaling of the @xmath0 data with the scaling form @xmath116 , where @xmath115 and @xmath43 is the exponent for the correlation length .",
    "the best fit is reached by @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "the critical exponent so obtained @xmath119 is thus quite close to the result of the quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "in this work , we proposed a bosonic rvb wave function with the form of the gutzwiller projected schwinger boson mean field ground state for the bhm .",
    "we find the proposed wave function predicts a continuous phase transition between the antiferromagnetic ordered state and the quantum disordered state . to determine the critical coupling strength , we have calculated the spin structure factor , the fidelity susceptibility and the binder moment ratio @xmath0 . through finite size scaling analysis of the latter two quantities , we find the critical coupling to be given by @xmath104 , in good agreement with the quantum monte carlo simulation results .",
    "the scaling analysis of @xmath0 also provides an estimate of the correlation length critical exponent(@xmath2 ) , which is also in good agreement with the result of quantum monte carlo simulation .",
    "we find the intralayer correlation is quite large at the phase transition point and it dominates over the interlayer correlation for @xmath63 twice as large the critical coupling strength .",
    "thus , the phase transition has nothing to do with the dimerization instability .",
    "our work indicates that the bosonic rvb wave function derived from gutzwiller projection of the schwinger boson mean field ground state has the potential to capture the physics of quantum phase transition with high accuracy .",
    "the failure of it in previous variational study @xcite can be attributed to the weakness of the mean field theory , which overestimate the tendency of the system to form interlayer dimers .",
    "such a overestimation is closely related to the relaxation of the local constraint in the mean field treatment , which prohibit multiple occupation of dimer on a given bond , even if the mean field theory points to the tendency of bose condensation of of such interlayer dimers .",
    "the same instability also cause the failure of the mean field theory itself for large @xmath63 .",
    "hence , the form the ground state predicted by the mean field theory is correct , however , the quantitative relation between mean field order parameters is less meaningful .",
    "the local constraint is thus indispensable for a correct description of the quantum antiferromagnet with the bosonic rvb state .    in this work ,",
    "we have proved the usefulness of the variational approach to the quantum phase transition in bhm . however , a more detailed study of the critical behavior and the excitation spectrum around the critical point is obviously needed to further characterize the quantum critical point in this system .",
    "we will leave this task to future investigations .",
