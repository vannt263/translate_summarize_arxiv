    "the investigation of the complicated vacuum structure of quantized yang - mills theories requires the use of non - perturbative methods .",
    "the lattice regularization is the most convenient in this respect . among other applications it allows to identify those excitations ( monopoles , instantons , etc . ) which are expected to dominate the euclidean path integral at large scales and to explain important features like chiral symmetry breaking and quark confinement in qcd .",
    "monopoles in which we take interest in this paper form the basis for the dual superconductor scenario of confinement @xcite . according to this scenario the condensation of ( anti- ) monopoles causes the color - electric flux to be squeezed into string - like flux tubes ( dual meissner effect ) .",
    "the consequence is a linearly rising potential between static quarks .",
    "whether extended non - abelian t hooft - polyakov - like monopoles ( see @xcite ) or singular abelian dirac - like monopoles play the major role in the confinement phenomenon has not been settled yet .",
    "the majority of investigations concentrates on the latter kind of excitations .",
    "these can be identified by abelian projection after an appropriate gauge has been fixed @xcite .",
    "up till now the maximally abelian gauge was considered to be the most favourable gauge @xcite ( for a recent review see e.g. @xcite ) . for this gauge the resulting @xmath2 degrees of freedom as well as the corresponding abelian monopoles were shown to reproduce almost completely the string tension of the full theory ( so - called abelian and monopole dominance , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "other gauges  defined for instance by diagonalizing gauge observables as parallel transporters along closed paths ( e.g. the polyakov loop ) which transform like higgs fields in the adjoint representation  have been studied , too @xcite .",
    "based on appropriately defined order parameters according to a construction of frhlich and marchetti @xcite the condensation of abelian monopoles in the confinement phase was demonstrated to occur widely independent of the gauge chosen @xcite .    but a general gauge independent proof for the validity of the dual superconductor picture is still missing .    therefore , it would be worthwhile to have a gauge - independent and  at the same time  geometric lattice definition of the monopole charge .",
    "this , in general , requires the existence of a higgs field in the adjoint representation .",
    "magnetic fluxes and the magnetic charge , respectively , can easily be obtained by projecting the non - abelian plaquette variables onto the local colour direction of the higgs field .",
    "however , the naive discretization does not provide any geometric meaning of the resulting charge .",
    "nevertheless , corresponding investigations of magnetic fluxes have provided useful insight into the phase structure of the 4d @xmath1 georgi - glashow model @xcite .",
    "a first geometrical definition for the monopole number has been given in @xcite .",
    "the lattice gauge field together with the higgs field determines local maps from the boundary of cubes into the coset space @xmath3 .",
    "the winding numbers of these maps provide the local integer - valued monopole charge , for each cube , or alternatively speaking , a closed magnetic current on the dual lattice . in our present work",
    "we are going to generalize the definition to a @xmath0 gauge - higgs theory .",
    "the higgs fields employed are considered to be @xmath4-valued fields .",
    "we shall present all the details necessary for developing a computer code for the calculation of the winding numbers from the local lattice field data .",
    "the resulting magnetic charge definition can be employed for explorations of the phase structure of @xmath0 gauge - higgs models .",
    "but , it might be worthwhile also for the application to pure @xmath0 gauge theories , when an auxiliary higgs field is determined as proposed for the recently invented laplacian gauge fixing @xcite .",
    "recently , in the context of investigations of the electro - weak phase transition for the @xmath1 theory another version of an integer - valued , gauge independent lattice magnetic charge definition was invented @xcite .",
    "it remains an interesting task to work out the interrelation between the different definitions , if there is any .",
    "section 2 will provide the general description and the necessary notations . in section 3",
    "we present the computation of the monopole number .",
    "some detailed proofs are shifted into the appendix . in section 4",
    "we shall draw the conclusions .",
    "in this work we want to consider a model consisting of an @xmath0 lattice gauge field @xmath5 coupled to a higgs field @xmath6 transforming with respect to the fundamental representation . @xmath7",
    "denote the lattice sites and pairs @xmath8 the corresponding links of a 4-dimensional simplicial lattice . without loss of generality for our construction of the local monopole number we work with a higgs field of fixed length , @xmath9 . in the following",
    "we denote by @xmath10 parallel transporters longer than one link .",
    "as the phase of the vector @xmath11 will be irrelevant for the monopole charge , it is sufficient to identify the corresponding equivalence class @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the latter can be represented by the @xmath13 projection matrix @xmath14 projecting on the subspace spanned by the vector @xmath15 . in this sense",
    "the higgs field takes values in a @xmath4 manifold .",
    "the action of a complex invertible matrix @xmath16 on elements of @xmath4 will be denoted by ` @xmath17 ' , e.g. @xmath18 means the projector @xmath19 or the class @xmath20 $ ] . for the lattice",
    "we assume an ordering of the lattice sites and denote the different kinds of simplices ( sites , links , triangles , tetrahedra , 4-tetrahedra ) by ordered tuples of vertices such as @xmath21 .",
    "if we consider a site @xmath22 of a given simplex @xmath21 as the coordinate origin , a cube @xmath23 parametrized by coordinates @xmath24 can be defined .",
    "our aim in this section is to define for a given tetrahedron @xmath25 a map @xmath26 from the boundary of the 3-dimensional cube @xmath27 to @xmath4 .",
    "this map is constructed from the link and higgs variables at the particular tetrahedron @xmath28 .    since @xmath29",
    ", the homotopy class of such a map is represented by an integer @xmath30 .",
    "this integer will be referred to as the local monopole number at the particular simplex .",

    "* geometric significance : * + the collection of the @xmath26 s define a section of a @xmath37-bundle over the @xmath38-skeleton of the lattice .",
    "this section may be regarded as an interpolation of the higgs field which is as horizontal as possible with respect to the lattice gauge field .",
    "the maps @xmath26 are worked out stepwise for higher simplices . in order to state their relevant properties , we need @xmath39-valued parallel transport functions @xmath40 as introduced in @xcite .",
    "these functions essentially measure to what extent the lattice gauge field fails to be flat .",
    "they are an important ingredient in the construction of @xmath0 bundles associated to lattice gauge fields . in our case ,",
    "the relevant formulae read @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the simplex @xmath28 in question is @xmath43 .",
    "then @xmath26 is assumed to meet the following requirements : @xmath44 and likewise for all other simplices , with the obvious replacements .",
    "it follows from the results in @xcite that such a collection of maps defines a section over the @xmath38-skeleton in a bundle with principal fiber @xmath4 .",
    "it is also seen that the local winding number of this section at a tetrahedron @xmath25 is just the winding number of @xmath45 .",
    "let us now explicitly construct this map",
    ".    requirements ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) suggest to define the @xmath26 s inductively for simplices of increasing dimension .",
    "this is done in four steps :    * step 0 : * as the @xmath26 s essentially interpolate the higgs field , we set @xmath46 for the lattice sites .",
    "* step 1 : * on the far end @xmath47 of the interval @xmath48 , we must have , by requirement ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath49 on the base @xmath50 , @xmath51 must be @xmath52 , by requirement ( [ 2 ] ) .",
    "we thus interpolate geodesically in @xmath4 for intermediate values of @xmath53 .    * step 2 : * on the far sides @xmath47 or @xmath54 of the square @xmath55 , we must have , by requirement ( [ 1 ] ) @xmath56 again , on the base @xmath57 , @xmath58 must be @xmath59 , by requirement ( [ 2 ] ) . for intermediate values",
    "we interpolate geodesically from the the far sides to the base .",
    "* step 3 : * in the last step we proceed as before .",
