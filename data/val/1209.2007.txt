    "in our research , we kept running across claims that the number one `` used to be prime . '' for example , at the time we wrote this article , the sequence http://oeis.org/a008578 [ ] in oeis @xcite was named `` prime numbers at the beginning of the 20th century ( today 1 is no longer regarded as a prime ) . '' and before we changed it in late 2011 , the english wikipedia article on _ prime number _ @xcite said `` until the 19th century , most mathematicians considered the number 1 a prime . '' there were ( and are ) individuals who defined the number one to be prime , but as we will see in this brief note , the history is much more complicated than `` one used to be prime . '' at first , most started the sequence of primes with 2 , but some began with 3 and a rare few began with 1",
    ". there does not appear to be any period of time during which most mathematicians defined one to be a prime .",
    "before we start , let s make two points clear .",
    "first , whether or not a number ( especially unity ) is a prime is a matter of definition , so a matter of choice , context and tradition , not a matter of proof .",
    "yet definitions are not made at random ; these choices are bound by our usage of mathematics and , especially in this case , by our notation .",
    "we will see , for example , that as the use of the integers changed , one ( unity , the monad ) , which at first was not generally viewed as a number by the ancient greeks , ` becomes ' a number some 2,000 years later . for much of history",
    "it did not even make sense to ask if the number one was a prime .",
    "second , when we stick to the ( modern ) positive integers , it is not difficult to adjust our theorems to allow the number one to be called a prime .",
    "for example , some say unity is omitted from the primes to preserve the uniqueness of factorization",
    ". however , in the past , mathematicians who defined one to be prime just added a couple words to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic ( fta ) . if we start with the version of the fta stated by crandall and pomerance @xcite ) , we need only add the two characters `` @xmath0 '' :    for each natural number @xmath1 there is a unique factorization @xmath2 where exponents @xmath3 are positive integers and @xmath4 are primes .",
    "the real problem with one being a prime only became apparent in the 18th century when mathematicians expanded their purview to wider notions of integers , such as the gaussian integers and general number fields .",
    "in that context , they were forced to address the notion of units , to separate the concepts of irreducibility and primality , etc .",
    "the generalization of prime to unique factorization domains clarified the role of unity and now informs the way we define primality in the ordinary positive integers .",
    "to get started , we will show that in the early days of defining primes , which we will illustrate with euclid , the unit ( one ) was not even considered a number , so was _ ipso facto _ excluded from the primes .",
    "this begins to change when stevin showed how to calculate with decimal real numbers in 1585 , bringing on a confused period in which some held unity to be a prime and others did not . when gauss first states and proves the fundamental theorem of arithmetic ( fta ) in 1801 , writers begin to coalesce slowly around the modern definition of prime  which again excludes unity .",
    "euclid , for example , defines unity ( @xmath5 ) , numbers ( @xmath6 ) , and the primes ( @xmath7 ) in book 7 of his _ elements _ as follows :    * a unit is that by virtue of which each of the things that exist is called one . *",
    "a number is a multitude composed of units . *",
    "a prime number is that which is measured by a unit alone .",
    "euclid ( and his contemporaries ) did not need to say explicitly that one was not a prime because primes were a subcategory of the numbers , so one was not a number .",
    "smith @xcite states it this way :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ aristotle , euclid , and theon of smyrna defined a prime number as a number `` measured by no number but an unit alone , '' with slight variations of wording . since unity was not considered a number , it was frequently not mentioned .",

    "( it is easy to extend this list of those for whom the first prime was three well into the 16th century @xcite . )",
    "most of the ancient greeks however , like euclid , began the sequence of primes with two .",
    "for about 2000 years most writers varied little from the position of the ancient greeks .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig_isadorus ] shows a copy of isidore of seville s ( c.636 ) work made in 1493 .        here",
    "isidore ( @xcite ) writes `` number is a multitude made up of units . for one",
    "is the seed of number but not number . ''",

    "many stuck with the tradition of excluding one from the primes , for example : p.  a.  cataldi ( 1603 ) @xcite , m.  mersenne ( 1625 ) @xcite , lon de saint - jean ( 1657 ) @xcite , f.  v.  schooten ( 1657 ) @xcite , the shuli jingyun ( c.1720 ) @xcite and l.  euler ( 1770 ) @xcite .",

    "definitions depend on context ( as well as on tradition and usage ) , so for example , the later number theorist v.  a.  lebesgue ( 17911875 ) omitted unity from the primes in an 1856 article @xcite , included it in an 1859 article @xcite , and then excluded it in 1864 article @xcite . for many authors we must infer their position by their usage .",
