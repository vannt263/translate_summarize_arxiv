    "the phase transition in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) at finite temperature ( @xmath5 ) and/or quark chemical potential ( @xmath6 ) is attracting much attention in recent years .",
    "when thermodynamic parameters such as @xmath5 reach to a typical qcd scale , abundantly formed hadrons start to overlap with each other and matter with color charges would appear , thus a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp )  @xcite is expected to emerge at such high @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 .",
    "the first principle studies based on the lattice qcd monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations actually indicate a phase transition from hadron phase to qgp around @xmath7-@xmath8 ( mev )  @xcite .",
    "various experimental observations and theoretical arguments imply the formation of a strongly coupled qgp in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "this extreme form of matter will be extensively investigated in lhc - alice experiments at cern , where we can simulate the matter evolution in the early universe .",
    "we also expect the transition to quark matter when the baryon chemical potential @xmath9 overcomes the nucleon mass energy @xmath10 .",
    "the color superconductor could appear at high density due to the attraction between quarks in the color antisymmetric channel  @xcite , and confined dense quark ( quarkyonic ) matter is also expected from large @xmath11 arguments @xcite .",
    "the forthcoming experiments at fair , j - parc and the low energy programs at rhic would be informative for these intermediate and high density states of matter , which may be realized in the neutron - star core .",
    "the qcd phase transition has two aspects ; the chiral and deconfinement transitions .",
    "these transitions are associated with the spontaneous breaking of the global symmetry @xmath12 in the chiral limit and the global @xmath13 symmetry in the heavy quark mass limit , respectively , where the order parameters are the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop .",
    "theoretical frameworks describing the dynamics of these order parameters would be mandatory to understand the qcd phase transition and phase diagram .",
    "the lattice qcd mc simulation is the most reliable and rigorous framework to investigate the non - perturbative aspects of qcd  @xcite .",
    "recent mc simulations demonstrate that the two transitions occur simultaneously within the error bars at small or zero chemical potential  @xcite .",
    "there is no clear explanation for the mechanism of coincidence of transitions , and some models suggest that the chiral and deconfinement transitions can start to separate as quark chemical potential becomes large .",
    "unfortunately , mc simulations have the notorious sign problem at finite @xmath6  @xcite , and can not answer whether two transitions can be separated or not . as a result",
    ", we need to invoke some approximations in qcd or effective models at finite chemical potentials , such as the strong coupling lattice qcd  @xcite , nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl )  @xcite and polyakov loop extended njl model ( pnjl )  @xcite , and chiral random matrix model  @xcite .",
    "strong coupling lattice qcd ( sc - lqcd ) can provide a simple and lattice - based description for the chiral and deconfinement transitions at finite @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this method is based on the strong coupling @xmath14 expansion , where the link variables are integrated out analytically and it is possible to elucidate important aspects of the qcd phase transitions beyond a contamination of the sign problem . in the pure yang - mills theory ,",
    "the color confinement in vacuum was shown in the strong coupling limit via the area law for the wilson loop  @xcite .",
    "sc - lqcd of the pure yang - mills theory with higher order corrections  @xcite is recently extended to the deconfinement transition study at finite @xmath5  @xcite . at finite @xmath5 ,",
    "the deconfinement transition was qualitatively explained on the base of the mean - field treatment of the polyakov loop in the leading order of the strong coupling expansion  @xcite , and higher order corrections on the polyakov loop action has been investigated recently  @xcite .",
    "the deconfinement transition is also investigated by taking account of the haar measure contributions to the effective potential  @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the polyakov loop is investigated also in the weak - coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "we find some pioneering works on the chiral symmetry breaking in vacuum  @xcite and its restoration at finite @xmath5 and/or @xmath6  @xcite where one can find a sophisticated expression of the effective potential describing the chiral transition in the strong coupling limit  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that a promising phase diagram structure has been obtained even in the strong coupling limit ( scl ) analytically  @xcite and in mc simulation @xcite . in our previous works",
    "@xcite , we have developed a formulation to evaluate the next - to - leading order ( nlo , @xmath15 )  @xcite , and the next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo , @xmath16 )  @xcite of the strong coupling expansion .",
    "finite coupling effects appear as modifications of the quark mass , quark chemical potential , and the wave function renormalization factor .",
    "the phase diagram evolution with @xmath17 can be interpreted in terms of those modifications .",
    "the sc - lqcd technique developed in these works is also applied to the graphene system in the condensed - matter physics  @xcite , where the strong coupling gauge theory is applicable at low energies .    in the works mentioned above , either of the two order parameters",
    "is included , and the interplay between these order parameters is not discussed .",
    "one of the interesting developments can be found in the works by gocksch and ogilvie  @xcite and by ilgenfritz and kripfganz  @xcite .",
    "they developed a model including both of the chiral condensate ( @xmath18 ) and polyakov loop ( @xmath19 ) . in this model , abbreviated as the goik model , the deconfinement is governed by the effective action for @xmath19 derived in the leading order of the strong coupling expansion in the pure yang - mills theory , and the the chiral transition is described by the strong coupling limit effective action for quarks  @xcite .",
    "the coupling between @xmath18 and @xmath19 is found to appear naturally from the quark determinant .",
    "this coupling leads to the correlation of the chiral condensate and polyakov loop , and the two transitions take place at similar temperatures  @xcite .",
    "this understanding in the goik model led to the development of the polyakov loop extended nambu - jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model  @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
