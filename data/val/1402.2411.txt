    "the emergence of quantum information protocols ( to perform logic gates and for the transport and the teleportation of information ) and the nanosciences have given an interest in dynamics and in control of multipartite quantum systems . a key problem is the understanding of the effects of dynamical processes on the whole multipartite quantum system .",
    "they can have consequences on each component of the system and could induce decoherence , relaxation and chaotic processes ( @xcite ) . in order to understand these problems we consider a spin chain , i.e. a set of @xmath0 @xmath1-spins two by two coupled to form a line chain .",
    "the coupling is modelled by the heisenberg or the ising - z interaction which allows a `` cohesion '' into the spin chain .",
    "each spin of the chain is submitted to a train of ultra - short kicks which are disturbed by a chaotic dynamical process .",
    "the subjects concerning decoherence and chaotic processes of regularly kicked spin chains have been studied by some authors @xcite . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have extended the analyses to irregular kicks on spin ensembles without any coupling between the spins .",
    "some interesting behaviours of the density matrix of the spin ensemble have been observed as for example an `` horizon of coherence '' for chaotic dynamics ( it corresponds to the time from which the disorder of the kick bath is transmitted to the spins ) .",
    "however , this ensemble can not be considered as a multipartite system ( no information is exchanged between the spins ) but only as a set of independent systems dephased during the evolution .",
    "a goal of the present paper is to see the behaviours and to understand the state modifications of a kicked spin chain coupled by the heisenberg or the ising - z interaction when the dynamics of the ultra - short kick trains is chaotically disturbed .",
    "a main question is to know if the horizon of coherence remains in spite of the coupling between the spins and if it is possible to control the spins before this horizon using appropriate stationary kicks . in the paper @xcite",
    "we have already seen the general behaviour of a ten spin chain coupled by a nearest - neighbour heisenberg , ising - z and ising - x interaction and submitted to various ultra - short kick dynamics ( stationary , drift , microcanonical and markovian ) .",
    "it results from this model that the coupling between the spins of the chain allows a better transmission of the disorder ( the disorder into a spin chain being defined as a large difference between the states of the different spins ) whatever the coupling .",
    "an initial dispersion of the kicks induces a disorder and an entanglement between the spins .",
    "the entanglement between two spins increases with the increase of the disorder , and so of the decoherence .",
    "the ising - x coupling always induces decoherence , even if there is no kick .",
    "it is the worst model to realize quantum controls .",
    "so , the spin chain coupled by an ising - x interaction will not be studied here .",
    "the behaviour of a spin chain coupled by an ising - z interaction is nearly identical to the one of a chain coupled by the ising - x interaction except that there is an initial `` plateau '' of coherence .",
    "it allows a conservation of the coherence ( which is not maximum ) during a little number of kicks ( see section [ consplateau ] ) .",
    "the heisenberg coupling seems to be the most efficient to realize quantum controls .",
    "this coupling is isotropic .",
    "two neighbour spins tend to be in the same state due to the coupling if there is no kick .",
    "for this coupling , all spins follow the behaviour of the average spin of the chain .",
    "the dynamical processes describing the trains of ultra - short kicks can be considered as being induced by an environment which disturbs a primary train of kicks .",
    "the disturbance can attenuate the kick strengths and/or delay the arrival kicks .",
    "since each kick train can be irregular , the spins can feel different trains .",
    "the set of kick trains is called a kick bath since we can assimilate the model to a spin chain in contact with a kind of classical bath . for a chaotic kick bath ,",
    "the chaotic process is defined by continuous automorphisms of the torus , i.e a dynamics characterised by its matrix and by its modulo @xmath2 ( this process have a lot of interesting properties , it is chaotic , ergodic , anosov ... ) .",
    "one of the advantages of the chaotic process is the property of sensitivity to initial conditions .",
    "this notion means that two points initially really close , do not remain close during the dynamics .",
    "they separate each other after a time called the horizon of predictability .",
    "this horizon in our model is the time from which the similar kick trains on different spins become different . in a spin ensemble",
    ", we have seen that this irregularity of the kicks induces an irregularity of the spin states from the horizon of coherence .",
    "this last horizon is larger than the horizon of predictability and corresponds to an initial conservation of the coherence .",
    "a spin can be assimilated to a qubit .",
    "the up state is supposed to be the value 1 and the down state the value 0 .",
    "so a variation of the spin population can be identified as a variation of the quantum information and a fall of the coherence can be a lost of information . during the horizon of coherence ,",
    "the coherence is conserved and so all the information .",
    "but after it , the coherence falls to 0 , the information is completely lost .",
    "but we have only seen this phenomenon for a spin ensemble , the spins ( or the qubits ) can not exchange any information .",
    "this paper studies the use of the interaction between the spins to show the possibility to realize information transports from one spin to another one and to control the spins ( using stationary kicks ) during the horizon of coherence . + this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the model of the disturbed kicked spin chain .",
    "section iii is devoted to the behaviours of the spin chain submitted to chaotic kicks according to the kind of the coupling : heisenberg or ising - z .",
    "the last section talks about the information transmission and control along the chain . the use of chaotic kick processes with the heisenberg coupling , allows to give an interesting example of information transmission . we can extend the previous example to a control of a closed spin chain using stationary kicks disturbed by a chaotic dynamical process .",
    "we consider an open chain of @xmath0 spins coupled by nearest - neighbour interactions .",
