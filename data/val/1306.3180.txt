    "flare events observed with the solar dynamics observatory ( sdo ) are searchable in the web - based browser tool isolsearch    http://www.lmsal.com/hek/hek__isolsearch.html , a window into the heliophysics events knowledgebase ( hek ) : hurlburt _ et al . _",
    "an automated flare detection algorithm that identifies flares in atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) data down to the goes c - class level is operated in real - time as part of the hek event identification scheme ( martens _ et al . _",
    "the most complete flare catalog for mid - size to large flares ( on the visible hemisphere ) is available from the geostationary operational environmental satellite ( goes ) , operated by the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) and searchable on the virtual solar observatory ( vso ) website    http://vso.nso.edu / cgi / catalogui/.    an automated solar - flare detection algorithm with about five times higher sensitivity than the noaa flare catalog , based on analysis of the 1 - 8   goes time profiles , has revealed over 300000 solar flare events over the last 37 years of 19752011    http://www.lmsal.com/~aschwand/goes/ : aschwanden and freeland 2012 ) .",
    "the rhessi orbit has a duty cycle of about 50% due to its near - earth orbit and thus has a corresponding fraction of flare event completeness .",
    "sdo has a duty cycle of almost 100% from its geosynchronous orbit .",
    "_ hinode _ has a field of view that does not cover the full sun , and thus has a flare event coverage of 51.4% for the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) , 24.5% for the solar optical telescope ( sot ) , and 14.9% for the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) ( watanabe , masuda , and segawa  2012 ) .",
    "the stereo mission consists of two twin spacecraft a and b , which circle the sun in opposite directions over a period of about 16 years , and thus have each a field - of - view that rotates the hemispheric view from the earth - directed front disk to the sun s back - side over a time interval of eight years .",
    "thus , the field - of - view is initially ( 2006 ) identical with an observer s position on earth , becomes non - overlapping for a and b but comprises together the full - sun during the quadrature phase ( 2010 ) , and coincides for a and b at the farside after eight years ( 2014 ) .",
    "consequently , stereo / extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi ) has the unique capability to capture a large fraction of flares on the back - side of the sun , which are not observable from earth , or are observed only partially above some occultation height .",
    "moreover , a large number of flares are simultaneously observed with stereo - a and -b , and thus can be triangulated to quantify their 3d geometric structure . in this article",
    "we document an automated flare detection algorithm that analyzes the entire stereo / euvi a and b database during the first six years of the mission ( 20062012 ) and provides some statistical results .",
    "the full euvi flare catalog is electronically accessible at    ( http://secchi.lmsal.com/euvi/euvi__autodetection/euvi__events.txt ) .",
    "the euvi flare catalog information may be particularly useful to identify stereoscopically observed flare events ( for 3d reconstruction studies ) , and to study occulted flare events ( regarding their vertical structure ) .",
    "the extreme ultra - violet imager ( euvi ) is a normal incidence euv telescope ( ritchey  chrtien type ) with a 2048@xmath22048 pixel detector , a pixel size of 1.59 , a field - of - view out to 1.7 solar radii , and observes in four spectral channels ( fe ix 171   , fe xii 195   , fe xv 284   , he ii 304   ) that span the @xmath3 mk temperature range .",
    "typical exposure times ( at the beginning of the mission ) are 24 seconds for 171   , 416 sseconds for 195   , and 1632 seconds for 284   . the stabilization of euvi images is accomplished with a fine pointing system that compensates for spacecraft jitter down to the subarcsecond level .",
    "further technical details on the optics , filters , response functions , and instrument calibration are given by wlser _",
    "et al . _  ( 2004 ) and in section 2 of howard _ et al . _  ( 2008 ) .",
    "euvi images are compressed onboard the spacecraft with the icer algorithm , which allows one to trade higher image cadence _ versus _ lower image quality .",
    "typical compression factors are in the order of 2040 , without degrading the image quality more than the photon noise in areas that record more than a few photons per pixel .",
    "the euvi is typically operated in one of two modes : the synoptic mode , or the campaign mode .",
    "the basic euvi synoptic mode has a fast cadence of 2.5 minutes for 171   , a slower cadence of 10 minutes for 195 and 304   , and 20 minutes for 284   , at the beginning of the mission .",
    "a higher cadence of 75 s for 171   and 5 minutes in the other wavelengths was used during special campaigns ( for two weeks in may 2007 ) . in the later years of the mission",
    ", the 171   and 284   channel were operated with low cadences in the order of 120 minutes , which is insufficient to detect small flares .",
    "also , a ring buffer records euvi images with a higher cadence during up to four hours per day , which are downloaded when extra telemetry is available .",
    "the telemetry drops stepwise with increasing distance of the stereo spacecraft from earth , reaching a minimum at the conjunction point behind the sun ( expected to be in 2014 ) .",
    "the decreasing telemetry also imposes a decreasing cadence of euv images , which affects the completeness of flare detection with progress of the mission .",
    "there is a fast and a slow method to automatically detect flare events in the euvi database .",
    "the quick method reads only the fits headers of each image file , which contains the information of the flux maximum ( fits descriptor datamax ) in each image , from which full - sun flux  time profiles can be created that are sufficient to identify the largest flares with some certainty ( at goes m- and x - class level ) , but without spatial information .",
    "however , for smaller flares ( of goes c - class and b - class ) , the variability of the euv emission from the quiet sun , bright points , explosive events , filaments , and prominences are of comparable magnitude as small flares , and thus small to intermediate flare events can not be identified unambiguously from such full - sun euv time profiles .",
    "therefore , in order to create a deep survey of euv flare events , we have to choose the slow method , which means reading and calibrating all observed euvi images ( which are stored as compressed files and need to be uncompressed for calibration with the idl procedure secchi@xmath4prep ) .",
    "the calibration with secchi@xmath4prep converts the observed datanumber per pixel to a normalized exposure time of 1 second ( in units of dn s@xmath5 ) , subtracts a dark - current bias , normalizes to open - filter position , and applies a calibration factor .    the first step of our automated event - detection algorithm is the generation of @xmath6 daily time profiles extracted from the @xmath7 pixel images , which represent the average flux @xmath8 $ ] in macropixels with a size of 2048/64 = 32 pixels ( @xmath9 mm ) , for each image position @xmath10 and @xmath11 , wavelength @xmath12   , and spacecraft @xmath13 . from the @xmath14 time profiles per wavelength and spacecraft we retain only the @xmath15 daily time profiles with the highest fluxes , which are generally sufficient to cover all active regions with flaring activity ,",
    "while the other time profiles mostly belong to the quiet sun and coronal holes and are ignored in the further analysis .",
    "the sun has a radius of about 600 pixels in an euvi image , and thus the ten macropixels with the largest flux variability cover about a fraction of @xmath16 of the full - sun disk , but reduce the amount of time profiles by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "the accuracy of the heliographic position inferred from these macropixels ( with a size of 32 pixels ) is thus @xmath18 pixels ( @xmath19 mm @xmath20 r@xmath21 ) , or @xmath22 heliographic degrees near disk center .",
    "the second step of the flare detection algorithm consists of identifying impulsive increases of euv emission in the previously sampled time profiles @xmath23 $ ] . for each macropixel",
    "we detect the maximum flux during a daily time interval and select for this day those ten time profiles that exhibit the largest fluxes ( inside the solar disk ) among all @xmath24 timeprofiles extracted from each macropixel .",
    "then we add up these ten time profiles into a synthesized profile .",

    "is defined by a flux enhancement that exceeds a background threshold level of @xmath43 $ ] , @xmath44 the threshold level of @xmath45 has been chosen to optimize the detection of events down to about the goes a5-class flare level .",
    "this sensitivity level is far above the photon noise level of euvi data .",
    "for instance , the typical quiet sun level for the euvi wavelength channels produces about 100 photons per pixel and second in the 171   wavelength ( howard _ et al . _",
    "2008 ) , which corresponds to @xmath46 photons per macropixel and second , and has a poisson noise of @xmath47 or 0.1% .",
    "the least sensitive channel is 284   with a quiet sun level of four photons per pixel and second , which corresponds to @xmath48 photons per macropixel and second , and has a poisson noise of @xmath49 or 1.5% .",
    "furthermore , since we analyze only the brightest time profiles from active regions and exclude those from the quiet sun , the significance level of the detected events is even higher .",
    "the significance level of each detected event can also be inspected _ a posteriori _ , since we provide the background fluxes @xmath50 and flux enhancements @xmath51 $ ] in the euvi event catalog .",
    "once an event with a significant temporal flux maximum is located at time @xmath32 in the synthesized time profile of the macropixel @xmath52 $ ] , the location [ @xmath53 of the event is identified ( from the @xmath15 possible positions ) by that macropixel that has the highest flux enhancement @xmath54 $ ] relative to the background flux @xmath55 $ ] , for which the heliographic longitude and latitude [ @xmath56 can be calculated .    for the time resolution of the extracted time profiles we set a lower limit of @xmath57 hour ] ( or six minutes ) , which is sufficient for flare detection , but reduces the amount of reading unnecessary images up to a factor of five during days with the highest cadence ( 75 seconds ) in campaign mode .",
    "there are a few gaps in the euvi / a and b data ( mostly at the beginning of the mission ) .",
    "euvi / a started taking data on 4 december 2006 , while euvi started at 14 december 2006 , and the initial testing phase lasted up to march 2007 , before regular temporal cadences were used for observations .",
    "such data gaps or periods when the spacecraft was rotated produce discontinuities in the euv time profiles , which were flagged by visual inspection and eliminated in the the flare detection algorithm . a list of all data gaps ( including data drop - outs , bad data , or instrumental anomalies ) that were excluded in the automated flare detection algorithm is available in the file    ( http://secchi.lmsal.com/euvi/euvi__autodetection/euvi__gaps.txt ) .",
    "all information that is needed to convert heliographic coordinates from the stereo / a or b spacecraft coordinate system to an earth - based coordinate system can be extracted from the fits descriptors of the euvi / a and b images , which includes the pixel numbers @xmath58 of the sun center in the images ( crpix1 , crpix2 ) , the pixel sizes @xmath59 in arcseconds ( cdelt1 , cdelt2 ) , the solar radius r@xmath21 in arcseconds ( rsun ) , the position angle @xmath60 ( in degrees , or @xmath61 in radian ) of solar north in the image ( crota ) , and the heliographic longitude @xmath62 and latitude @xmath63 of the subsolar point of the stereo spacecraft in a stonyhurst coordinate system seen from earth ( hglon , hglat ) .",

    "is found to have a mean and standard deviation of [ @xmath178 , which corresponds approximately to our theoretical estimate with a median value of [ @xmath179 , given the fact that there is an additional uncertainty of similar magnitude in the definition of the flare position , which is given by the spatial extent of an active region , of the order of a few heliographic degrees .",
    "we created an automated event detection algorithm that measures the peak times , euv fluxes , and heliographic positions of impulsive euv events from the stereo - a and -b spacecraft , and in each of the four euvi wavelength channels ( 171 , 195 , 284 , 304   ) separately . the euv events in this stereo / euvi catalog correspond mostly to solar flares detected also in soft x - rays with the goes 18   channel , down to a level of about goes class a5 .",
    "a fraction of euv events without goes detections may possibly be associated with filament and prominence activities .",
    "the detection efficiency in the different channels depends strongly on the temporal cadence used , which necessarily drops with the progress of the mission due to the increasing distance of the stereo spacecraft from earth and the related reduction of telemetry .",
    "the primary wavelength with high cadence were 171 and 304   from 2006 to august 2009 , while it was 195 and 304   in the later years of september 2009 to 2012 .",
    "in addition , euv dimming that accompanies the launch of cmes often prevents the detection of flares in the 171 , 195 , and 284   channels due to the partial cancelling of euv brightening and dimming changes in euv flux time profiles .",
    "thus , the 304   channel turned out to be the most efficient channel for euv event detections ( 79% ) , while the other channels detect a substantially lower number of euv events ( 10% in 195   , 7% in 284   , and 4% in 171   ) ; see table 2 .",
    "the statistics of detected events also strongly varies with the solar cycle .",
    "the lowest number of euv events ( 1096 detections ) occurred in the solar minimum year 2007 , while the highest number ( 6337 detections ) was registered in 2012 , which is believed to be close to the maximum of the current solar cycle 24 . in the overall we detected 19976 events , which includes multiple detections by the two spacecraft and four wavelength channels each .",
    "if we try to estimate the number of independent solar euv events , we can take those from the most efficient channel and spacecraft , which is 8561 euv events detected with euvi / a in 304   ( see table 2 ) . for comparison",
    ", a number of 33,290 independent soft x - ray flare events were detected with the goes 18   channel with an automated algorithm that is about five times more sensitive than the official noaa solar - flare list ( aschwanden and freeland 2012 ) .",
    "thus the detection ratio of these two automated detection algorithms is @xmath180 ( see also figure 3 ) .",
    "the detection rates of flare events in euv 304   and soft x - ray goes 18   is highly correlated , although the 304   emission results from impulsive brightenings in the chromosphere due to flare - induced electron precipitation ( producing also hard x - rays ) , while the soft x - ray emission is mostly believed to be of coronal origin from post - flare loops that have been filled with chromospherically heated plasma .    useful quantitative characterizations of event statistics are size distributions of the measured parameters .",
    "we find for the occurrence frequency distribution of euv peak fluxes a power - law function with a slope of @xmath151 , averaged from all eight wavelength channels on the two stereo spacecraft .",
    "for the occurrence frequency distribution of euv event durations we find a power - law function with a slope of @xmath181 .",
    "interpreting the euv events as nonlinear energy dissipation events in a slowly - driven fractal - diffusive self - organized criticality model ( aschwanden 2012 , 2013 ; bak , tang , and wiesenfeld 1987 ) , the measured power - law indices constrain the spatio ",
    "temporal diffusion index [ @xmath182 and the flux  volume power - law index [ @xmath183 \\approx 0.45 $ ] ] .",
    "this result is close to the case of classical diffusion [ @xmath124 .",
    "the flux - volume relationship [ @xmath184 deviates significantly from proportionality , as found in another recent euv study from aia ( aschwanden and shimizu 2013 ) , and thus indicates some nonlinear scaling law between the emitted euv flux and the flare volume [ @xmath128 .",
    "the mission - long stereo / euvi event catalog of 20062012 is available at :    http://secchi.lmsal.com/euvi/euvi__autodetection/euvi__events.txt .",
    "daily euvi profiles for both stereo spacecraft for each of the four wavelength channels are at    http://secchi.lmsal.com/euvi/euvi__autodetection/daily__euvi__profiles/ , synthesized from the most active regions on the solar disk ( combining the ten macropixels with the highest euv fluxes ) , which have a substantially better signal - to - noise ratio than full - disk euv time profiles .",
    "the euvi event catalog contains information on the peak times , rise times , decay times , peak fluxes , background fluxes before and after the flare , fluences , and heliographic positions of the spacecraft , the euv events in spacecraft coordinates , and earth - based heliographic coordinates .",
    "the heliographic positions allow for an approximate localization of flare events within a few heliographic degrees ( limited by the @xmath185 size of the macropixels used in the automated detection algorithm ) .",
    "this catalog may be useful for the study of steresocopically observed flare events , and occulted flares on the farside of the sun .",
    "we thank frdric auchre , lindsay glesener , nat gopalswamy , bala poduval , andreas klassen , and david long for helpful discussions and suggestions to create a mission - long stereo / euvi event catalog .",
    "part of the work was supported by the nasa stereo mission under nrl contract n00173 - 02-c-2035 .",

    "<S> we generated an event catalog with an automated detection algorithm based on the entire euvi image database observed with the two solar terrestrial relations observatory stereo - a and -b spacecraft over the first six years of the mission ( 20062012 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the event catalog includes the heliographic positions of some 20000 euv events , transformed from spacecraft coordinates to earth coordinates , and information on associated goes flare events ( down to the level of goes a5-class flares ) . </S>",
    "<S> the 304   wavelength turns out to be the most efficient channel for flare detection ( 79% ) , while the 171   ( 4% ) , 195   ( 10% ) , and the 284   channel ( 7% ) retrieve substantially fewer flare events , partially due to the suppressing effect of euv dimming , and partially due to the lower cadence in the later years of the mission . due to the sun - circling orbits of stereo - a and -b , a large number of flares have been detected on the farside of the sun , invisible from earth , or seen as partially occulted events . </S>",
    "<S> the statistical size distributions of euv peak fluxes ( with a power - law slope of @xmath0 ) and event durations ( with a power - law slope of @xmath1 ) are found to be consistent with the fractal - diffusive self - organized criticality model . </S>",
    "<S> the euvi event catalog is available on - line http://secchi.lmsal.com/euvi/euvi__autodetection/euvi__events.txt and may serve as a comprehensive tool to identify stereoscopically observed flare events for 3d reconstruction and to study occulted flare events . </S>"
