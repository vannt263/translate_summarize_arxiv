    "in recent years ,  manifolds have received great attention in the string literature .",
    "this is mainly because compactification on such spaces may be used to reduce the number of dimensions in models built from the intrinsically ten dimensional critical superstring @xcite .",
    "the focus has largely been on the case of complex dimension @xmath1 , since the corresponding compactification is to four space - time dimensions .",
    "( it is also the case that , in many respects , within topological field theory on  target spaces the case @xmath1 plays a special rle @xcite . )",
    "however , one might expect interesting properties for other values of @xmath2 as well .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the case @xmath3 whose special features derive from the fact that the topology of the target must be either a torus or a k3 surface .",
    "the classification of toroidal target spaces has been known for some time @xcite .",
    "the local geometry of the moduli space of conformal field theories with k3 target space topology was understood shortly afterwards @xcite and although some aspects of the global form of the moduli space have been conjectured and studied @xcite , more precise statements concerning this question have remained elusive .",
    "we will use mirror symmetry to address this question of the form of the moduli space .",
    "we find that , given a couple of minor assumptions , combining a  analysis near the field theory limit with the study of a mirror symmetry transformation is sufficient to give the precise form of the moduli space .",
    "this paper is not intended to provide the full mathematical exposition of the analysis required  for that the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "here we only give a brief summary of the methods used and conclusions reached by the analysis .",
    "the analysis of the moduli space of string theories on a k3 surface differs markedly from that of the more familiar  moduli spaces related to string compactifications to four dimensions .",
    "firstly , in studying the case where the target space @xmath4 is a  threefold , the assumption @xmath5 is usually made .",
    "under this assumption , the deformations of complex structure of @xmath4 and of the ( complexified )  `` decouple '' to give the complete moduli space a local product structure @xcite ( at least over generic points in the moduli space ) .",
    "these two types of deformations may then be studied independently . for a k3 surface",
    "we have @xmath6 and the above structure is lost .",
    "we are thus forced to analyze deformations of complex structure and deformations of  together .    in another respect",
    "however the k3 case is simpler  the @xmath0=(2,2 ) superconformal invariance of a string with  target space is extended to @xmath0=(4,4 ) supersymmetry in the case @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this is equivalent to the geometric statement that a  manifold in complex dimension two admits a hyperkhler metric .",
    "this @xmath0=(4,4 ) structure serves to fix the local form of the moduli space completely .",
    "this can be contrasted with the case @xmath1 where the extended chiral algebra @xcite has yet to provide much insight into the classification of string theories .    as in the case @xmath1 , the local dimension of the moduli space of conformal field theories",
    "can be matched to the dimension of the moduli space of the geometrical objects representing the target space if we regard the `` geometrical object '' as including , in addition to the target space metric , the specification of a @xmath7-field , i.e. , an element of the second real ( de rham ) cohomology group of the target . in the case",
    "@xmath1 , the @xmath7-field naturally combined with the khler form to provide a complexified khler form . in the case of k3",
    "this is clearly impossible  @xmath7 lives in a 22-dimensional space whereas the dimension of the space of khler forms varies with the complex structure but is at most 20 .",
    "despite this fact we will still find that a beautiful structure arises when the @xmath7-field is included in the moduli space .    at the topological level",
    ", mirror symmetry might appear rather trivial for a k3 surface since the mirror of a k3 surface ( equipped with metric and @xmath7-field ) is another such k3 surface .",
    "however , the geometric data of the mirror k3 surface thus obtained is not , in general , isomorphic to the original .",
    "thus the mirror map acts as a non - trivial automorphism on the `` classical '' moduli space of k3 surfaces ( i.e. , the  moduli space of metrics and @xmath7-fields ) . the mirror map in this context",
    "was first studied long ago in @xcite and some of the observations in that paper lead to some of the methods used here .",
    "although the purpose of this paper is to concentrate on the case where the target space is a k3 surface , it should be noted that much of what follows applies to any target space with @xmath6 .",
    "the only steps in the following argument which will not be directly applicable to the determination of the moduli space of this more general case are the explicit form of the moduli space of einstein metrics , and the particular self - mirror k3 theory used .    in section [ s : mod ] we will present the outline of the construction of the moduli space of @xmath0=(4,4 ) and @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories . in section [ s : coh ] we discuss the interpretation of the moduli space in terms of the space of total cohomology of k3 . in section [ s : alg ] , some aspects of mirror symmetry on algebraic k3 surfaces are discussed .",
    "let us first fix some notations .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the double coset space resulting from dividing the group @xmath9 by the right - action of @xmath10 and left - action of @xmath11 .",
    "( @xmath9 and @xmath10 will always be continuous lie groups and @xmath11 will be discrete . )",
    "@xmath12 denotes the unique ( up to isomorphism ) even self - dual lattice in @xmath13-dimensional space with signature @xmath14 , when @xmath15 .",
    "basis vectors may be taken such that the inner product has the following form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 ( one uses @xmath18 in place of @xmath19 when @xmath20 ) , @xmath18 is the cartan matrix of the lie algebra @xmath18 , and @xmath10 is the hyperbolic plane : @xmath21 we will use @xmath4 to denote a specific smooth k3 surface .",
    "one can show that the intersection pairing on @xmath22 gives it the structure of a lattice isomorphic to @xmath23 ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath24 be a @xmath13-dimensional space with an inner product of signature @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath25 is the orthogonal group on @xmath24 and @xmath26 is the subgroup preserving @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath28 we can identify @xmath29 as the set of space - like @xmath30-planes in @xmath24 ( i.e. , @xmath30-planes on which the inner product is positive - definite ) .",
    "@xmath29 can also be regarded as one of the two connected components of the set of _ oriented _ space - like @xmath30-planes . under this latter interpretation ,",
    "we can write @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the index 2 subgroup of @xmath25 with the same connected components as @xmath33 .    it was shown in @xcite using arguments from supergravity @xcite that the required moduli space , @xmath34 , of conformal field theories on a k3 surface is locally of the form @xmath35 .",
    "this is probably best understood from the argument presented in @xcite , which we now review . the @xmath0=(4,4 )",
    "superconformal algebra contains affine @xmath36 algebras in both the left and right sectors .",
    "this symmetry acts on the marginal operators spanning the tangent spaces of @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of such a symmetry restricts the form of the holonomy group of the zamolodchikov metric of @xmath34 .",
    "the restriction is so severe , in fact , that it then follows from berger s classification @xcite of holonomy groups that either @xmath34 is locally isomorphic to a quaternionic symmetric space , or that the holonomy is reducible .",
    "moreover , the non - flatness of the zamolodchikov metric is enough to rule out the reducible holonomy case .",
    "a simple analysis of any conformal field theory giving rise to a k3 target space tells us that @xmath34 has real dimension 80 @xcite .- fields has real dimension 22 .",
    "however , for each ricci - flat metric on the k3 surface there is an @xmath37 of complex structures , so the overall dimension count is @xmath38 . ]",
    "this , together with the known classification of quaternionic symmetric spaces ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , completes the proof .",
    "let us now make two assumptions about the form of @xmath34 , both of which we consider to be quite reasonable .",
    "firstly we assume @xmath34 is geodesically complete and secondly we assume @xmath34 to be hausdorff .",
    "while some non - hausdorff moduli spaces have appeared in string theory @xcite , this happened in the context of a target space of indefinite signature .",
    "there is no reason to believe that something as unpleasant as this should happen in the case of a k3 surface .",
    "it then follows that @xmath39 for some group @xmath11 acting discretely on @xmath35 . thus to complete the description of @xmath34",
    ", we only need to find @xmath11 .",
    "we begin our determination of @xmath11 by analyzing the classical form of the moduli space of k3 surfaces . using the techniques of @xcite , one may decompose @xmath35 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the half - line of positive real numbers which we parameterize by @xmath42 .",
    "the decomposition depends on a choice of null vector @xmath43 , and the space @xmath44 provides the @xmath45 on which @xmath46 acts and on which @xmath47 is based .",
    "the space @xmath47 is known to be isomorphic to the teichmller space for einstein metrics of volume one on a k3 surface ( and their orbifold limits ) @xcite .",
    "it is natural then to identify @xmath42 as giving the size of the k3 surface and @xmath45 as the moduli space of @xmath7-fields on the target space .",
    "these identifications may be established by looking at the metrics on the above mentioned spaces .",
    "the zamolodchikov metric on @xmath35 is known to be the left - invariant metric . from @xcite",
    "this induces a metric on each of the terms on the right hand of ( [ eq : decomp ] ) where this should now be viewed as a `` warped product '' , i.e. , the metric does not respect the product structure .",
    "one may now show ( using @xcite ) that the metrics induced are those given precisely by the extended weyl - petersson metric in the sense of @xcite .",
    "such an isometric identification allows us to identify every point in @xmath48 with an einstein metric on a k3 surface ( or orbifold metric ) together with a @xmath7-field .",
    "this can be taken as another version of the statement that the  is exactly conformally invariant on a k3 surface with ricci - flat metric @xcite .",
    "it also shows that the zamolodchikov metric and weyl - petersson metric coincide exactly on the moduli space  a fact which in general @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories holds only to leading order in the large radius limit @xcite .    the moduli space of smooth einstein metrics of volume one on a k3 surface @xmath4 is determined in @xcite to be @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the group of components of the diffeomorphism group of @xmath4 , and @xmath51 is the space of orbifold metrics .",
    "( it is generally believed that such orbifolds should be included when considering a string target space @xcite ; if we include them , we get the geodesically complete space @xmath52 . )",
    "the discrete group @xmath53 is determined in @xcite to coincide with the group @xmath54 which has index 2 in @xmath55 .",
    "the `` missing '' @xmath56 in @xmath55 may be generated by @xmath57 acting on @xmath45 .",
    "we also know that the on a  manifold is invariant under all translations @xmath58 , where @xmath59 .",
    "thus we should divide the space @xmath45 of @xmath7-fields by additive translations by @xmath23 .",
    "( as an abstract group , these additive translations simply form a @xmath60 . )",
    "furthermore one may consider complex conjugation of the target space .",
    "if one considers such a complex conjugation for a  one sees that the transformation @xmath61 is required in addition to the conjugation of the complex structure of the target .",
    "such a transformation may be represented by @xmath57 and thus generates the missing @xmath56 from above .",
    "therefore , in terms of the decomposition ( [ eq : decomp ] ) one sees a group @xmath62 ( which is the full space - group of @xmath23 ) of identifications that should be made on the right - hand side and thus on @xmath48 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath63    this is the maximal set of identifications that can be made from classical geometry .",
    "any further statement requires some quantum geometry .",
    "the mirror construction of @xcite provides us with such a tool .",
    "first we need the clarify the meaning of the mirror map in the context of @xmath0=(4,4 ) theories .",
    "mirror symmetry reverses the sign of a @xmath64 charge derived from an @xmath0=2 chiral algebra .",
    "now an @xmath0=4 chiral algebra contains an @xmath36 affine subalgebra , which is larger than the @xmath64 affine subalgebra of an @xmath0=2 theory .",
    "given an @xmath0=4 theory , though , we may choose an @xmath0=2 subalgebra of the @xmath0=4 algebra by specifying the corresponding @xmath65 .",
    "each @xmath0=4 theory thus gives rise to an @xmath66 of @xmath0=2 theories .",
    "this leads to construction of the moduli space of @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories of string on a k3 , which we denote by @xmath67 , as a fibre bundle @xmath68 with fibre @xmath69 .",
    "each point in @xmath67 corresponds to an @xmath0=(4,4 ) theory on which a particular @xmath0=(2,2 ) structure has been chosen ; the subscripts @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote charges with respect to the left and right @xmath64 currents respectively within the @xmath0=(2,2 ) theory .",
    "a _ ( left ) mirror map _ on the corresponding teichmller space @xmath72 of @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories is a map @xmath73 with the property that , for all @xmath74 , the @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories at @xmath75 and @xmath76 are isomorphic , but with a switch of charge assignments @xmath77 .",
    "we also define _ right mirror maps _ which switch @xmath78 .",
    "such a map on @xmath72 can be pushed down to a map @xmath79 on the teichmller space @xmath48  since two theories which are mirrors as @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories are isomorphic as @xmath0=(4,4 ) theories , any mirror map within @xmath80 should give rise to an element of @xmath11 .",
    "note that some mirror maps on @xmath72 may be trivial on @xmath48 , in the sense that they induce the identity element of @xmath11 .",
    "such maps relate pairs of points in @xmath72 which lie over the same point in the base space @xmath48 . what will be of more interest are the nontrivial mirror maps which map to a nontrivial element of @xmath11 .",
    "the difference between trivial and nontrivial maps is shown schematically in figure [ fig : f1 ] .",
    "( 0,0 ) ( 3,45 ) ( 3,12 )    we now consider an example of a generically nontrivial mirror map with a fixed point on @xmath48 . given the gepner model @xcite associated via @xcite to the k3 hypersurface @xmath81 in the weighted projective space @xmath82 we find the mirror as an orbifold of the original space by the method of @xcite .",
    "the orbifolding group thus found is trivial and so this theory is its own mirror .",
    "the fact that this theory is self - mirror is also related to some issues regarding arnold s `` strange duality '' observed in @xcite",
    ". this mirror map acts non - trivially on the marginal operators of this theory and thus on the tangent bundle of @xmath48 . by analyzing this action , it is possible to show that there is a lattice @xmath83 such that the induced automorphism @xmath79 of @xmath48 lies in @xmath84 .",
    "in fact , there is a decomposition @xmath85 such that @xmath79 acts by simply exchanging the two terms on the right - hand side .",
    "the decomposition can be chosen so that one of the @xmath86 lattices in ( [ eq : twobits ] ) is a sublattice of the @xmath23 lattice on which the classical @xmath55 symmetry of ( [ eq : clsym ] ) acts .",
    "we have thus found the explicit form of another generator of @xmath11 .",
    "a straight - forward but somewhat involved calculation then shows that the classical symmetries , @xmath87 , and the above @xmath56 mirror map generate the whole of @xmath84 .",
    "that is , we have @xmath88 but now from @xcite , which establishes that @xmath84 is a _ maximal _ discrete group acting on @xmath48 to yield a hausdorff quotient , it follows that @xmath89 completing the proof that the moduli space has the precise form @xmath90 ( as had been speculated by seiberg @xcite ) .    to summarize",
    ", we have shown that the full group of identifications to be made on the teichmller space is generated by the following :    1 .",
    "classical identifications made for the moduli space of complex structures .",
    "2 .   the integral @xmath7-field shifts .",
    "complex conjugation ( together with a change in sign of the @xmath7-field ) .",
    "4 .   the mirror map .    one should note that this is also true for the case @xmath91 where the target space must be a torus  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that this moduli space @xmath92 is precisely that which one would obtain for toroidal compactifications of the heterotic string down to six - dimensional spacetime using the methods of @xcite .",
    "this equivalence between the moduli space of k3 compactifications and toroidal compactifications ( for the relevant strings ) was established locally in @xcite but it is unclear why they turn out to be globally isomorphic .",
    "the derivation of the moduli space @xmath34 in the previous section and @xcite is somewhat unpleasant and yet produces a beautifully symmetric result .",
    "this is a consequence of having derived the moduli space using the ideas of classical geometry necessitating the intermediate step of equation ( [ eq : clsym ] ) . now that we have the moduli space we may reinterpret it from the standpoint of quantum geometry in a more symmetric way .",
    "first let us quickly review the form of the moduli space of complex structures on a classical k3 surface . consider a non - vanishing holomorphic 2-form @xmath93 on @xmath4 representing an element of @xmath94 .",
    "let us specify a `` marking '' of @xmath4 , i.e. , a basis @xmath95 , @xmath96 of @xmath97 determining an isomorphism of that lattice with @xmath23 .",
    "the global torelli theorem @xcite essentially says that the complex structure of @xmath4 is expressed uniquely in terms of the periods @xmath98 up to a change of basis of @xmath97 . to state",
    "this more precisely , we write @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "the hodge - riemann bilinear relations assert that @xmath101 this implies that the oriented 2-plane @xmath102 in @xmath103 spanned by @xmath104 and @xmath105 is space - like , i.e. , has positive definite metric .",
    "in fact , specifying @xmath93 up to multiplication by @xmath106 ( which determines the hodge structure ) is equivalent to specifying the oriented 2-plane @xmath102 .",
    "now the moduli space of oriented space - like 2-planes in @xmath107 is given by @xmath108 .",
    "when we mod out by diffeomorphisms , we would expect to obtain a description of the moduli space of complex structures on a k3 surface as an open subset of @xmath109 ( and we would expect to get the entire space ( [ eq : cxmod ] ) if we include orbifold complex structures ) . actually , there are some technical difficulties in interpreting ( [ eq : cxmod ] ) as a moduli space , but the interpretation is essentially correct ( see @xcite for more precise statements ) .",
    "the extension of this to string theory follows immediately .",
    "the space @xmath48 is one connected component of the set of oriented space - like 4-planes in @xmath110 .",
    "the space @xmath110 can be identified with the space @xmath111 of all real cohomology groups on @xmath4  the inner product is obtained by supplementing the intersection pairing on @xmath103 by a pairing on @xmath112 which has matrix ( [ eq : h ] ) on the standard generators of those two spaces ( i.e. , the class of a point , and the class of the entire space @xmath4 ) . the natural lattice @xmath113 inside of @xmath114 inherits an integer - valued pairing from this inner product , giving it the structure @xmath115 .",
    "an @xmath0=(4,4 ) theory on a k3 surface is thus specified uniquely by an oriented space - like 4-plane in @xmath111 ( belonging to the correct component ) where the 4-plane is located relative to the @xmath113 lattice .",
    "this picture becomes clearer when we go to the @xmath0=(2,2 ) moduli space .",
    "now the moduli space , @xmath67 , is an @xmath116-bundle over @xmath34 .",
    "in fact one may show that the teichmller space takes the form @xmath117 in the language of the previous paragraph , this is one component of the space of orthogonal pairs of oriented space - like 2-planes in @xmath110 .",
    "that is , we not only specify an oriented space - like 4-plane but we give it an internal structure of being spanned by two orthogonal oriented 2-planes .",
    "we may now specify these oriented 2-planes in terms of complex vectors as in the classical case .",
    "namely , define @xmath93 and @xmath118 as arbitrary elements of @xmath119 ( mod @xmath106 ) such that @xmath120 the space of such vectors gives precisely the teichmller space required .",
    "thus we may identify the moduli space of @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories on a k3 surface as being the space of all possible choices of @xmath93 and @xmath118 subject to ( [ eq : om ] ) where the positions of these vectors are located relative to @xmath113 .",
    "this statement may be considered to be the quantum version of the global torelli theorem .",
    "as explained earlier , mirror maps will act on the teichmller space @xmath121 .",
    "in fact a nontrivial mirror map may be identified with the interchange @xmath122 .",
    "our picture now begins to look very similar to that pursued in @xcite for the case @xmath1 .",
    "there is a slight difference since in the latter case one had @xmath123 for the k3 case however , we may only specify the general statement that both @xmath93 and @xmath118 lie in the full cohomology @xmath124 at a generic point in moduli space .",
    "the following construction may be used to reconcile the approaches .",
    "let us choose two null vectors @xmath125 and @xmath126 in @xmath127 such that @xmath128 , so that @xmath125 and @xmath126 span a hyperbolic plane .",
    "let @xmath129 be the subspace of @xmath111 perpendicular to @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "for each oriented space - like 4-plane @xmath130 , we define @xmath131 this amounts to choosing a specific @xmath0=(2,2 ) theory to represent an @xmath0=(4,4 ) theory .",
    "we may now identify @xmath129 with @xmath103 . if @xmath93 specifies the @xmath132 direction , ( [ eq : om ] )",
    "then implies @xmath133 the complex structure of @xmath4 can thus be determined from @xmath93 in the usual way .",
    "one can also obtain the khler form and @xmath7-field information from @xmath118 .",
    "the mirror map interchanges the two .",
    "note that we may equally specify @xmath134 as a mirror map .",
    "we may compose this with the previous mirror map to produce the map @xmath135 .",
    "this map may be identified as the map taking @xmath136 in the @xmath0=(2,2 ) theory or equivalently as complex conjugation of the target space .",
    "note that such a map is usually trivial in the moduli space of @xmath0=(2,2 ) theories but that our construction , through specific labeling of the @xmath64 charges , leads to a non - trivial map .",
    "now that we have identified how mirror maps act on the moduli space of conformal field theories on a k3 surface , we can explain several of the mirror - type phenomena which have been observed for algebraic k3 surfaces .",
    "given any subgroup @xmath137 of @xmath22 such that the cokernel @xmath138 has no torsion and the intersection form on @xmath139 has signature @xmath140 , we can associate the family of `` algebraic k3 surfaces of type @xmath137 '' which consists of all complex structures on the k3 for which the classes on @xmath137 are all of type @xmath141 .",
    "this construction was introduced into the mathematics literature @xcite as part of the explanation of arnold s `` strange duality '' put forward by pinkham and dolgachev , and moduli spaces of these structures were studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "the moduli space of algebraic k3 surfaces of type @xmath137 has complex dimension @xmath142 when @xmath139 has signature @xmath140 .",
    "we can extend this idea , and define the set of `` cft s of type @xmath137 '' on a k3 surface to be the image in the conformal field theory moduli space of the set of s whose complex structure is an algebraic k3 surface of type @xmath137 , and whose khler class and @xmath7-field are taken from the space @xmath139 .",
    "the complexified khler moduli space has complex dimension @xmath143 , so the entire cft moduli space of type @xmath137 has complex dimension @xmath144 . since the construction segregates complex and khler deformations , the cft moduli space of type @xmath137 embeds naturally into the @xmath0=(2,2 ) moduli space @xmath145 .",
    "suppose that the orthogonal complement @xmath146 can be written in the form @xmath147 for some lattice @xmath0 ( orthogonal direct sum )",
    ". then a mirror map @xmath148 can be defined which exchanges the given hyperbolic plane @xmath10 with the hyperbolic plane @xmath149 .",
    "when @xmath148 is applied to the cft moduli space of type @xmath137 , it reverses the rles of khler and complex structure deformations .",
    "it is not hard to see that the resulting moduli space is in fact the cft moduli space of type @xmath0  the complex structure is one for which @xmath0 ( rather than @xmath137 ) consists of @xmath141 classes , and the khler structure is now taken from @xmath150 .",
    "this gives a precise cft interpretation of arnold s strange duality and other related phenomena for k3 surfaces ( an earlier version of which was given by martinec @xcite ) .",
    "finally we note a link between our construction of the mirror map for k3 surfaces and voisin s construction of mirror pairs of threefolds @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the latter construction consists of taking an orbifold @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is a torus of complex dimension one .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for suitable pairs @xmath153 of @xmath4 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 are mirror pairs at the level of the hodge numbers , @xmath156 ; and `` a - model '' and `` b - model '' @xcite correlation functions .",
    "the k3 surfaces involved must be of type @xmath137 , with @xmath137 the lattice invariant under the @xmath56-action .",
    "one may show that our mirror map for k3 surfaces directly establishes @xmath157 and @xmath158 as a mirror pair and thus it follows that @xmath154 and @xmath155 are truly mirror manifolds at the level of conformal field theory .",
