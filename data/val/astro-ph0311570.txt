    "soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) are two classes of objects being candidates to magnetars , neutron stars with magnetic fields above the quantum critical threshold @xmath1 g. in the model proposed by @xcite , which we will follow through this work , dynamo action in a fast rotating proto - neutron star amplifies the `` seed '' magnetic field ( @xmath2 g ) by one to three orders of magnitude . the simplest estimate of the magnetic field intensity is derived from measurements of their rotational periods ( @xmath3 ) and period derivatives ( @xmath4 ) , through the well known expression    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the magnetic field intensity , @xmath7 is the pulsar radius ( @xmath8 cm ) , @xmath9 is the angle between the rotational and magnetic field axis , @xmath10 is the moment of inertia ( @xmath11 g @xmath12 ) , and @xmath13 is the speed of light .",
    "their ages can also be estimated through the characteristic age    @xmath14    but both calculations assume continuous spin - down driven by magnetic dipole braking , an assumption which has been questioned by several authors @xcite , in different contexts , regarding axps and sgrs .",
    "the derived figures are shown in table 1 .",
    "as most of the objects are younger than 10@xmath15 years , it seems reasonable to look for the supernova remnant ( snr ) that was originated at the same supernova explosion .",
    "in fact , almost all sgrs and axps were tentatively associated to some snr .",
    "though , the likelihood of those associations is put in doubt because the age estimated for those snrs is generally larger than the characteristic age of the associated magnetar .",
    "this situation leads to the `` age '' and `` velocity '' problems of sgrs and axps .",
    "both problems are related to the relatively low characteristic ages found for these objects .",
    "the snrs usually associated to them seem to be systematically older , thus the age problem .",
    "some sgrs and axps have been found to lie beyond , at or near the border of their proposed snrs , and , given their low ages , the implied velocities are much higher than those found for ordinary pulsars ( see @xcite for a discussion about these objects ) . as seen on tables 1 and 2 , there is a large uncertainty in those estimates , mainly due to uncertainties in the distances .",
    "this implies uncertainties in the radii on which age estimates are based through models of the expansion .",
    "several authors have addressed magnetar - snr associations .",
    "some of them have discarded either the magnetar hypothesis or the association , based on those problems .",
    "this became known as the `` nature versus nurture '' debate , where one side proposes that the characteristics of sgrs and axps are derived from their special nature ( see @xcite ) , while the other side finds more plausible that the environment is the actual responsible , nurturing the otherwise ordinary neutron stars with a fossil accretion disk @xcite .",
    "associations between pulsars and snrs are generally examined according to the following criteria : 1 ) positional coincidence in sky ; 2 ) distance estimates ; 3 ) age estimates ; 4 ) evidences for interaction between the neutron star and the snr .",
    "additional criteria may be derived from these , like the estimate of the projected velocity on sky of the compact object .",
    "@xcite did a comprehensive study of positional coincidences for magnetar - snr associations .",
    "distance can be determined by neutral hydrogen column density measurements , evidence of association with another object ( e. g. , hii region or molecular cloud ) whose distance is already known , or through surface brightness - diameter ( @xmath16 ) relations .",
    "this last method is not considered reliable enough , because it ignores the effect of density and structure of the local interstellar medium , resulting in a large dispersion of values from the best fit , as can be seen in @xcite .",
    "some snrs on the proposed associations show plerions , usually taken as positive signal of the presence of a neutron star , but most do not present that feature .",
    "finally , measurements of hi column density are subject to systematic errors from models , and usually are not better than 50% , implying on similar uncertainties in distance determinations .",
    "radio pulsars can have their distance estimated by use of dispersion measure , however sgrs and axps have not yet been detected in radio waves .",
    "there are reasons to believe they can not emmit radio signals , either because they are magnetars , where the huge magnetic field induces photon splitting rather than pair creation ( @xcite , but see @xcite ) , or in the case they are accretors , because accretion quenches radio emission @xcite .",
    "snr age estimates are usually derived from the knowledge of the radius by means of an approximate version of the expansive blast - wave evolution equations .",
    "we shall see in next section that those approximations which ignore the previous phase(s ) can introduce an apreciable error in cases near phase transition , and such approximations imply a reduction of the number of variables to two by linking the explosion energy , the local interstellar medium density and the ejected mass .",
    "the present local density of the interstellar medium can be estimated within 50% uncertainty , though this may not be representative of the structure of the interstellar medium prior to the supernova explosion .",
    "for example , an explosion which occurred inside a hii region , ( low density medium ) and have run into a nearby molecular cloud ( high density medium ) would be misleading , since the observer would be able to estimate the molecular cloud density only . even inside the hii region it would be likely that density is not constant .",
    "situations like those can be modelled ( see a good review on this in the work of @xcite ) , but the point is that the unknown structure of the pre - supernova environment introduces one more possible systematic error on age estimates .",
    "the ejected mass can be estimated from the observation of how much fe was produced , coupled to models of supernova yields , when the snr is young .",
    "explosion energy is usually considered to be within a factor of 2 of the canonical value of 10@xmath17 erg , due to previous both observational and theoretical knowledge .",
    "the review of @xcite considers the energy range @xmath18 erg for classical snii , from a sample with a dozen well - observed events .",
    "however , these estimates also contribute with their own uncertainties , because the type of explosion event giving rise to a sgr - axp is completely unknown .",
    "as the radius picks the same relative uncertainty as the distance , the combined uncertainty on the age estimate will not be smaller than a factor of 2 , and probably much larger than that .",
    "we must recall that it is not uncommon to be unsure about the phase a given snr is in , and that near the transition time between phases approximations do not strictly hold .",
    "more accurate relations can be used , reducing systematic errors , though usually most authors feel the rather small gain in precision is not worth the trouble .",
    "blast - wave velocity estimates could also be used to determinate age and radius , through relations similar to the ones for radius and age .",
    "knowledge of both radius and velocity would determine the phase of the expansion , removing a source of uncertainties .",
    "unfortunately , such estimates must come from x - rays measurements difficult to be made , and up to now they could not be obtained for any of the proposed associations .",
    "finally there are evidences of interaction between the neutron star and the snr in some of the proposed associations , which show plerions ( or filled - centre morphology ) .",
    "additionally , one of the associations was reported as presenting a jet - like feature @xcite .",
    "the overall reliability of the described estimates is not good , although several papers have addressed the association issue , and drawn conclusions about axp and sgr nature . in this work",
    ", we will show that at least an important factor for those estimates is still missing , namely the injection of energy by the internal magnetar , and we analyze the proposed associations bearing that factor in mind .",
    "the next section is dedicated to snr expansion considerations , section 3 introduces the effects of the injected energy on the snr , while section 4 deals with an application of those considerations to the observed sample . in section 5 we discuss our results .",
    "supernova explosions eject several solar masses to the interstellar medium , which form the snr . in the further evolution ,",
    "mass from the swept interstellar medium will be added , at a rate @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the snr radius ( blast - wave front ) , @xmath21 is the snr expansion velocity , and @xmath22 represents the local interstellar medium density , which we will take as a constant for simplicity . a treatment including density as a power - law function of the distance from the supernova can be seen on @xcite , which is also a good review reference about the non - radiative expansion phases of snrs .",
    "the initial expansion velocity is set by the total kinetic energy of the explosion , @xmath23 , and the ejected mass , @xmath24 .",
    "the interstellar medium will not affect much the expansion until the swept mass becomes @xmath25 , or , equivalently , the snr mass    @xmath26    another approximation that holds true is that very little energy ( compared to the huge kinetic energy of the snr ) is lost , so energy can be considered constant . in this way , with mass and energy set to constants , and negligible external pressure , velocity is also ( approximately ) constant .",
    "this is the _ free expansion _ phase .",
    "an approximate linear relation between radius and age ( @xmath27 ) follows    @xmath28    a more accurate expression can be found in the work of @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the number density of the interstellar medium , @xmath31 is the hydrogen mass and @xmath32 is the mean molecular weight of the interstellar gas .",
    "energy is scaled in units of @xmath33 erg ( @xmath34 erg ) , mass in units of 10 @xmath35 ( @xmath36 @xmath35 ) , number density in units of 1 @xmath37 ( @xmath38 @xmath37 ) , and age in units of 100 years ( @xmath39 yr ) .",
    "the velocity at which the blast - wave front expands is approximately    @xmath40    as @xmath41 increases , so does the ram pressure of the interstellar medium , slowing down the snr expansion .",
    "growing mass and pressure must then be taken into account .",
    "the snr enters the _ sedov - taylor _ phase , named after the works of @xcite and @xcite about pressure - driven explosions . to describe the snr expansion one should solve the equation    @xmath42",
    "the internal pressure being    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the adiabatic index ( 5/3 for an ideal gas , 4/3 for a relativistic one ) and @xmath45 is the internal energy of the gas inside the internal cavity formed by the remnant , whose mass concentrates in a thin shell ( its thickness will be neglected ) .",
    "as the total energy is roughly constant , one can use    @xmath46    remembering that eq .",

    "the correspondent expression for velocity is    @xmath55}^{-3/5 } \\ ; . \\label{vsttm}\\ ] ]    although we have been considering the constancy of the total energy , in fact the snr has been slowly radiating away .",
    "as the snr expands , its temperature decreases , because it depends on the blast - wave velocity , following the well - known relation for strong shocks ,    @xmath56    [ t ]    where @xmath57 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath21 was taken from the derivative of eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) .",
    "eventually t will reach @xmath58 k , where the dominating cooling process changes from thermal _ bremsstrahlung _ to line emission , which is more efficient to radiate away energy .",
    "that way , the adiabatic approximation ceases to be accurate , and the snr enters into the _ snowplow _ phase . as a rough approximation to estimate when the sedov - taylor phase ends ,",
    "it is usual to estimate how much time it would take to reduce the thermal energy of the snr to zero , considering just radiative losses .",
    "starting from the energy loss per particle ,    @xmath59    [ rad ]    where @xmath60 erg @xmath61 s@xmath62 is a simple cooling function appropriate for ionized gas at temperatures @xmath58 k @xmath63 10@xmath64 k , @xmath65 is a metallicity factor parametrized for solar abundances , one can integrate that equation and equate the result to the dynamical time @xmath66 , obtaining    @xmath67    if we choose to use eq .",
    "( [ vsttm ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) , a slightly more accurate expression results    @xmath68    it has been suggested that snrs are very difficult to be seen after 20 kyr @xcite .",
    "the similarity of the values of `` fading time '' and the transition from the sedov - taylor to snowplow phase may be taken as an indicative that they are related by a factor , of order unity .",
    "thus , we will adopt eq .",
    "( [ tstsp ] ) as the rough limit of visibility of one snr .",
    "since our intention is to address associations between snrs and magnetars , we will not explore further the expansion of snrs into the snowplow phase , because no snr would be detectable in that phase or afterwards .",
    "the energy loss of a pulsar is usually taken as arising from a rotating magnetic dipole approximation ,    @xmath69    that energy is intercepted by the snr , which will contain , in an internal cavity , most of either relativistic particles or electromagnetic waves emmited by the central object .",
    "either way , this cavity would thus be filled by a relativistic gas , pushing the snr from the inside .",
    "considering that the magnetic field , moment of inertia and @xmath9 are constants , they can be absorbed together with other factors into a new constant @xmath70 . after integrating eq .",
    "( [ lpsr ] ) the period evolution can be expressed as    @xmath71    with @xmath72 being the initial period of the pulsar .",
    "two additional constants will be defined    @xmath73    is the initial time - scale for deceleration , and    @xmath74    is the initial rate of energy loss .",
    "we notice that @xmath75 and @xmath76 . with these relations and eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ lpsr ] ) as    @xmath77    total injected energy is just the integral of eq .",

    "( [ tau0 ] ) and ( [ l0 ] ) are already scaled to the typical magnetar parameters .",
    "we remark that unless magnetars are born with very short periods ( @xmath81 1 ms ) , their magnetic fields would not be expected to grow enough to cross the critical quantum boundary @xmath82 , according to the model of magnetar formation of @xcite .",
    "while pulsars can be born with such short periods , they are not required to do so .",
    "the difference of two orders of magnitude in the magnetic field strenght between a typical pulsar ( @xmath83 g ) and a typical magnetar ( @xmath84 g ) means 4 orders of magnitude in both @xmath85 and @xmath86 values .",
    "this implies in turn a dramatically different influence on snr expansion : a magnetar will inject most of its rotational energy into the internal cavity of the snr within a day , while a pulsar would take tens or hundreds of years , depending on its initial period and magnetic field .",
    "also , a magnetar will inject typically @xmath53 times more energy than a pulsar , and , more remarkably , that energy is a factor of 10 - 20 bigger than the kinetic energy of an ordinary snr .",
    "it is analogous to the suggestion of @xcite about that transfer of energy being the very cause of a supernova event .",
    "gravitational radiation losses are usually larger than rotating magnetic dipole ones for pulsars with very short periods , hence any estimate of the initial period based on the electromagnetic dipole torque will result in a figure corresponding roughly to the period of transition between gravitational and magnetic dipole dominances .",
    "in fact , a simple estimate can be obtained equating eq .",
    "( [ lpsr ] ) to the following expression for gravitational wave - carried energy loss , taken from @xcite :    @xmath87    where g is the familiar gravitational constant and @xmath88 is the oblateness of the neutron star .",
    "the result is    @xmath89    which shows that for a magnetar the large magnetic dipole losses would not be much affected by gravitational losses . in other words",
    ", the initial period will effectively be the same period that has allowed the magnetic field intensity to increase above @xmath82 , and almost all rotational energy will be injected on the snr .",
    "however , there is room to consider competition for the energy loss dominance between magnetodipole radiation and gravitational radiation by r - modes . doing a very simple analysis , from the work of @xcite",
    ", we would expect r - modes gravitational waves to be more efficient than magnetodipole radiation to extract rotational energy from the rapidly rotating magnetar for @xmath90 ms .",
    "though we feel more detailed studies of both the possible damping of r - modes by the neutron star crust , and the enhancement of magnetic fields in newly - born neutron stars are in need before we can address properly this issue .",
    "earlier works have addressed pulsar energy injection on a snr @xcite , but they have not explored the case of a magnetar source . it can be easily seen that the scenario built by @xcite can not hold when magnetars are considered , since they have assumed the energy injected by the pulsar to be smaller than the kinetic energy of the snr .    the introduction of magnetar - injected energy changes the equations describing the expansion of the snr in the following ways : eq .",
    "( [ pres ] ) remains the same , but @xmath51 could be used to represent the dominance of the injected energy over the initial kinetic energy of the snr ; eq .",
    "( [ ener ] ) picks up a new term , becoming    @xmath91    however , in this simple formulation of the problem , only the blast - wave front is described , and we have not described the full problem of two gases .",
    "the energy injection is so quick that we consider all the snr is instantaneously reacting to it .",
    "that is not strictly true , but since the internal shock ( the inner cavity boundary ) would be near the external shock ( the snr boundary ) in less than 100 years , that is much before the transition to sedov - taylor phase starts , this simplification will not affect much sedov - taylor and posterior phases .",
    "we will only consider @xmath92 through this work .",
    "while the works of @xcite and @xcite studied the injection of energy by a pulsar into a snr , we adopted simplifications that are not well suited to be combined with their methods and results .",
    "however , the general results obtained in this work are not expected to be affected by these approximations .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations to find solutions for the set of equations describing the position and velocity of the blast - wave front , with and without including the energy injected by an internal magnetar , the former case to test the simulation engine .",
    "our results for the case with energy injection are similar to the ones in the case without energy injection , though with explosion energy set to the initial kinetic energy plus energy injected ( from the internal magnetar case ) .",
    "those results are nearly identical because of the extremely short time needed for the injected energy to raise above the initial kinetic energy .",
    "our numerical results differ only from the expressions shown on eqs .",
    "( [ rsttm ] ) to ( [ tstsp ] ) in one point , namely our values for @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the free expansion phase differ from @xcite as if the energy were reduced by a factor of 1.14 .",
    "this factor comes from the approximation done on section 2 , specifically the difference in @xmath93 values on eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) .",
    "this factor must be multiplied to the energy if our values are to be compared to @xcite . through this work , however , we will adopt the values we have found , without corrections .",
    "the discrepancy is not large , and certainly does not affect much our considerations , given other simplifications done in this work .",
    "the numerical results can be appreciated in figs .",
    "[ f - rt ] and [ f - vt ] . in fig .",
    "[ f - rt ] we show the evolution of @xmath94 for both cases ( with and without energy injection ) . in fig .",
    "[ f - vt ] we show the evolution of @xmath95 for both cases .",
    "the proposed associations between would - be magnetars and snrs are shown in tables [ t - as ] and [ t - snr ] .",
    "we shall analyze them by looking first into the situation without considering the injection of energy by a magnetar .",
    "this situation is shown in fig .",
    "[ f - dados ] , where we show the range of radius and ages associated to each snr considered , the characteristic ages of the magnetars , and the radius evolution curves for two different cases ( thick solid lines ) : a `` low density / low mass '' evolution scenario , in which @xmath96 m@xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath37 , and a `` high density / high mass '' evolution scenario , with @xmath99 m@xmath97 and @xmath100 @xmath37 . for both extreme cases ,",
    "explosion energy is held fixed to 10@xmath17 erg .",
    "the position of a given snr should be between these two extremes , unless quite different explosion energies are considered .",
    "certain snrs have no reliable age estimate @xcite ; for those , we adopted an arbitrary range 0.2 - 30 kyr , which is the possible range for galactic snrs . for several associations , snr and magnetar ages",
    "are not compatible , and some magnetar ages are not compatible with the snr expansion in enviroments with ordinary values for @xmath101 . that has been used to justify the model of axps and sgrs being born in regions of higher density than radio pulsars @xcite , or to dismiss the association altogether .",
    "varying the ejected mass value will displace those curves diagonally ( in free expansion phase only ) , but will not affect meaningfully the position of the curves in the sedov - taylor phase . in any case , quite unreasonable values of both @xmath24 and @xmath101 should be invoked to maintain some associations as valid . the other way to displace the curves ( in both phases )",
    "is by changing explosion energy .    in fig .",
    "[ f - dados ] we also show the curves including the energy injection by a magnetar with @xmath102 g and @xmath103 ms .",
    "the displacement of curves helps to attribute lower values to the density than before to all associations , and it makes possible to `` save '' some otherwise untenable associations .",
    "thus , the injection of energy could be behind the age discrepancy , as snrs truly associated with magnetars would have expanded faster than expected . in other words ,",
    "the snr which has been born with an internal magnetar will seem older . the actual relation between the true age ( @xmath104 ) and the apparent one ( @xmath105 )",
    "can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ rsttm ] ) , for the sedov - taylor phase , considered for both the conventional energy value ( @xmath106 ) and the one including energy injected ( @xmath107 ) , as    @xmath108    typical figures would be in the range @xmath109 .",
    "likewise , other reference timescales will be shifted .",
    "the transition from free expansion to sedov - taylor phases will occur sooner , because of the higher initial velocity .",
    "the transition to snowplow phase will occur at 36 kyr after the supernova explosion ( see eq .",
    "[ tstsp ] ) , using @xmath110 .",
    "this is just meant to show that an snr with energy injection could be visible for more time than an ordinary snr , while at the same time appearing to be younger .",
    "the time a neutron star will take to catch up its snr ( @xmath111 ) before the transition to the snowplow phase ( while it is still visible ) can be roughly estimated from eq .",
    "( [ rsttm ] ) and the neutron star ( constant ) velocity @xmath112 km s@xmath62 , resulting in    @xmath113    where we ignored the small negative term on eq .",
    "( [ rsttm ] ) for the sake of simplicity . from this last equation",
    "it can be seen that only a fast magnetar can catch up its snr shell .",
    "for example , if @xmath114 , as suggested for some associations , and @xmath115 , then @xmath116 kyr . of course , the proximity of the neutron star to the snr shell can induce a `` reenergization '' of the shell , extending the visibility of the snr to later ages ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we do not address this possibility here .",
    "writing the distance of the neutron star to the center of the snr as @xmath117 , the quantity @xmath118 becomes an observable parameter ( projected in the sky ) .",
    "inverting eq .",
    "( [ tcross ] ) and inserting @xmath118 , we can find an expression for the minimal neutron star velocity needed to reach a relative displacement @xmath118 at age @xmath119 ,    @xmath120    if the neutron star velocity points transversally to the line of sight , then eq . ( [ vbeta ] ) gives the actual velocity of the neutron star .",
    "we shall analyse the proposed associations taking into account the energy injected by the internal magnetar , addressing the plausibility of the association , and the nature of the compact object .",
    "similar studies have been published by several authors @xcite , based mainly on position and velocity considerations .",
    "those works have disregarded magnetar characteristic ages , in favour of snr estimated ages . however , their conclusions are discrepant .",
    "we shall in turn disregard the ages of the snrs , because if they were born with an internal magnetar , their ages are overestimated according to eq.([te ] ) .",
    "the novel feature of our approach is just the fact that , if the axps and sgrs are magnetars , following the model of @xcite for magnetar formation , which is based on a dynamo action to make possible the growth of the magnetic field beyond ordinary pulsars range , they will inject energy enough on their snrs to affect their expansions , making them reach a larger size in less time than it was considered by previous authors .",
    "although our simulation engine is probably too crude to provide a reliable estimate of the time after which the injection of energy becomes less efficient , even more sophisticated simulations have not been tested to know this number .",
    "we will take as enough to say that injection times below one month are securely within the bounds to provide optimal coupling between injected energy and the snr kinetic energy .",
    "as the main effect of the energy injected is to add to the initial kinetic energy of the snr , any pulsar which can inject most of its rotational energy in less than one month will provide an snr evolution as if the kinetic energy were the initial plus the injected one .",
    "the injection time for the smallest @xmath6 of the axp / sgr sample ( axp 2259 + 586 ) is lower than 5 days , considering @xmath121 ms .",
    "even initial periods as large as 3 ms would provide injection times close or within to the one month figure , which make us certain of the effectiveness of the coupling .",
    "pulsars , on the other hand , have injection times longer than decades , typically .    for simplicity , and having no way to estimate the actual initial periods of axps and sgrs , we assume all them as being born with @xmath122 ms , which in turn determines that the injected energy ( @xmath123 erg at @xmath124 ) will be essentially the same , regardless of the actual value of @xmath6 ( from eq .",
    "[ einj ] ) , as long as @xmath125 1 year .",
    "because of this fact , we will only consider two extreme situations to analyze the associations : the `` low density / low mass '' evolution scenario , where @xmath96 m@xmath97 and @xmath98 @xmath37 , and the `` high density / high mass '' evolution scenario , with @xmath99 m@xmath97 and @xmath100 @xmath37 .",

    "all associations can be considered likely .",
    "@xcite contend that only axp j1845 - 0258/g29.6 + 0.1 , axp 1841 - 045/g27.4 + 0.0 and axp 2259 + 586/ctb 109 could be valid .",
    "@xcite considered sgr 1806 - 20/g10.0 - 0.3 and sgr 0526 - 66/n 49 as plausible , in addition to the 3 already mentioned by @xcite .    it is expected that if magnetars exist and are born in supernova explosions , they can inject enough energy to enhance the expansion of their associated snrs .",
    "if axps and sgrs are indeed magnetars , their associated snrs should appear older than the ages derived from standard expansion models .",
    "we analyzed all the proposed associations , and have come to the following results :    \\1 ) if the characteristic age of the neutron star is regarded as the true age of the association , then sgrs and axps may not be magnetars at all ( or the model of @xcite is not correct regarding magnetar origin ) , for only one case ( sgr 1806 - 20/g10.0 - 0.3 ) has shown good agreement within the model , and even the true nature of g10.0 - 0.3 was put in doubt ;    \\2 ) if characteristic ages are in turn ignored ( see @xcite , among others ) , then two sgrs ( out of 5 ) and three axps ( out of 5 with proposed associations ) seem to be associated within our model , so about 50% of general agreement .",
    "it should be noted that two associations which agreed within our model ( axp j1845 - 0258/g29.6 + 0.1 and axp 2259 + 586/ctb 109 ) were already believed to be true by previous works @xcite , meaning that uncertainties in distance are large enough to allow for both possible scenarios ( standard and with energy injection ) ;    \\3 ) axp 1841 - 045/g27.4 + 0.0 and sgr 0526 - 66/n 49 can only be considered as true associations if the magnetars were born with @xmath157 ms , because in that way the energy injected would be insufficient to directly affect snr expansion .",
    "these results from our model are tied to the dynamical evolution of magnetars . while we have assumed for simplicity the standard magnetic dipole braking with braking index equal to 3 ,",
    "several proposals have been done that argue for different braking models : fossil or fallback accretion disks @xcite , episodes of relativistic wind emission @xcite , a different constant braking index @xcite , magnetic field decrease @xcite . as the measurements of braking indices for 5 young pulsars revealed that all but one have significant departures from the canonical value , it should not come as a surprise that magnetars do not follow the standard model of spindown .",
    "the main effects of alternative models are to change the estimates of magnetic field strength and spindown age .",
    "nonetheless , the influence in our model would be very small , since @xmath85 can be increased up to one month without appreciable modifications on the model , and rotational energy is not dependent on spindown models .",
    "that is why we feel justified to leave item ( 1 ) above aside of the discussion .",
    "spindown models that allow for ages significantly smaller or larger than the conventional characteristic age are required to explain certain associations , if they are true ones , either within our model , or considering the standard scenario .",
    "supposing that our results from item ( 2 ) above represent the actual situation , we could ask where are the snr that are associated to the other sgrs and axps . the answer can be that they were not detected yet , since they lie generally at regions of coexistence of hii regions , other snrs , and other types of objects ( variable stars , young stars , molecular clouds , etc . ) . including axp 0142 + 614 and axp j0720 - 312 in the sample",
    ", we would have slightly less than 50% of the true associations identified . on the other hand ,",
    "few of the latter can be considered as firm , due to several other factors .",
    "for example , the angular size of snrs are often quoted without uncertainties , which certainly is an understatement , given the dificulty to recognize a snr and to assess its shape and size .",
    "it is worthy to remark that a similar analysis , ignoring the effects of the injection of energy , and desconsidering conventional characteristic ages , can be done to the same associations , and will result in different age and velocity ranges than those obtained here .",
    "indeed , even associations considered unlikely by us may turn out to be likely .",
    "this is because the standard energy snrs would take more time to reach the observed sizes , allowing for higher ages for the associations than in our model , and thus producing lower velocities than those we found .",
    "nevertheless , that scenario requires non - standard spindown and no injection of energy by the neutron star , be it a magnetar or not .",
    "it is interesting to check that the most important factor to decide on the plausibility of associations is @xmath118 . as @xmath118 increases",
    ", associations are considered increasingly unlikely . however",
    ", @xcite points to the possibility that a snr expanding in a region with anisotropic interstellar medium densities will be distorted and/or expands faster in one or more directions .",
    "this means that the geometrical center of the snr can be displaced from the actual explosion site .",
    "although it is difficult to take this effect into account quantitatively , one should be cautious to do not dismiss it entirely .",
    "it is possible that one or more of the proposed associations are affected by this effect , which can increase or decrease @xmath118 randomly .",
    "that effect will be more accentuated for snrs that have been expanding in low - density regions ( `` bubbles '' ) amidst high - density `` walls '' , and it increases with age .",
    "the first consideration is the case for the most massive stars , which do not live long enough to move far away from the sites where they had been born , while their stellars winds create a low - density cavity .",
    "the second consideration means we must expect @xmath118 estimates to be a little bit more scattered as age ( and radius ) increases .",
    "besides studying associations including axps and sgrs , we also examined the association psr j1846 - 0258/g29.7 - 0.3 @xcite , which also suffers from the age problem , since it has the smallest characteristic age known among pulsars ( 723 years ) , and the snr age was estimated as at least 1800 years .",
    "the magnetic field of this pulsar is @xmath158 g , considering magnetic braking spindown , slightly above the quantum critical field , and by so marginally qualifying as a magnetar .",
    "it was not detected at radio wavelenghts , only in x - rays .",
    "the association is considered very likely , as the pulsar is located at the geometrical center of the snr , coincident with a radio / x - ray nebula , probably powered by the pulsar .",
    "proceeding as in the other cases investigated in the previous sections , we see from fig . [ f - known ] that the range of radius quoted on the literature is nearly coincident with the range allowed by our two extreme cases , considering the characteristic age .",
    "this way , there are no preferences for high or low densities or ejected mass . as before",
    ", we will ignore the characteristic age , to found that the age range allowed is 250 - 700 years , in case of high @xmath24 or @xmath101 , and 650 - 6000 years , in case of low @xmath24 or @xmath101 .",
    "intermediate values of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath101 would provide intermediate ranges of ages .",
    "the placement of the neutron star at the geometrical center of the snr imply in low velocities or alignment between the velocity vector and the line of sight .",
    "it is important to notice that @xcite find a braking index @xmath159 and age @xmath160 years for this pulsar , in which case the magnetic field can be under the quantum critical one . nonetheless , this association represents one more evidence against the consideration of the characteristic age ( without braking index information ) as a good age estimate .",
    "we have left for a future work ( allen & horvath , in preparation ) the study of an alternative origin scenario for magnetars , the collapse of a white dwarf star , induced by accretion or merging from a binary companion .",
    "simulations for this scenario @xcite reveal that @xmath161 @xmath35 can be ejected , with an explosion energy of @xmath162 erg , implying on higher initial velocities .",
    "finally we would like to point that magnetars lose very little rotational energy through gravitational waves , when compared to typical pulsars , unless r - modes can play an important role , which is not clear to us .",
    "statistical studies on pulsar gravitational wave detectability , like the one performed by @xcite , shall not be affected by this consideration , at least for the current detectors , like virgo , because of the scarcity of magnetars .",

    "<S> most of the proposed associations between magnetars and supernova remnant suffer from age problems . </S>",
    "<S> usually , supernova remnants ages are determined from an approximation of the sedov - taylor phase relation between radius and age , for a fixed energy of the explosion @xmath0 erg . </S>",
    "<S> those ages do not generally agree with the characteristic ages of the ( proposed ) associated magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> we show quantitatively that , by taking into account the energy injected on the supernova remnant by magnetar spin - down , a faster expansion results , improving matches between characteristic ages and supernova remnants ages . however , the magnetar velocities inferred from observations would inviabilize some associations . </S>",
    "<S> since characteristic ages may not be good age estimators , their influence on the likelihood of the association may not be as important .    in this work we present simple numerical simulations of supernova remnants expansion with internal magnetars , and apply it to the observed objects . </S>",
    "<S> a short initial spin period , thought to be important for the very generation of the magnetic field , is also relevant for the modified expansion of the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> we next analyze all proposed associations case - by - case , addressing the likelyhood of each one , according to this perspective . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a larger explosion energy and reasses the characteristic age issue , and conclude that about 50% of the associations can be true ones , provided sgrs and axps are magnetars . </S>"
