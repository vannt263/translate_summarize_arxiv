    "the hubbard model @xcite provides a minimal framework for describing electron interactions in a crystal lattice , and has played a central role in condensed matter and quantum many - body physics . especially since the discovery of high-@xmath4 superconductors , the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) hubbard model , believed to contain the essential physics of the cuo plane @xcite , has been intensely studied .",
    "the combination of theoretical and numerical techniques has made important progress @xcite , but some basic questions have remained .",
    "one of the questions is whether there is phase separation ( ps ) in the ground state of the hubbard model .",
    "the question is important in its own right , as a key element in our understanding of the phase diagram of this fundamental model .",
    "recent experimental indication of spatial inhomogeneities in cuprates @xcite has further increased its potential relevance and interest . in the past two decades",
    "a large body of numerical work has been devoted to resolving this issue @xcite , but the results have been conflicting .",
    "the differing answers underscore the challenges : the requirement of high accuracy , as well as the difficulty in extrapolating to the thermodynamic limit because of extreme sensitivity of the signal to both finite - size and shell effects .    in this paper , we apply recent advances in auxiliary - field quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques @xcite to study the ground state of the repulsive 2-d hubbard model .",
    "our goal was to shed light on the question of ps .",
    "a second motivation comes from ultra - cold atoms , where rapid experimental progress promises a new avenue  optical - lattice emulators @xcite  for direct `` simulations '' to investigate properties of hubbard - like models .",
    "detailed , accurate numerical data would allow quantitative benchmark and comparisons in future optical - lattice experiments . in our approach",
    ", the ability to control the sign / phase problem with a good approximation , combined with a boundary condition integration technique , drastically reduces the finite size and shell effects .",
    "this allows us to reach much higher accuracy than previously possible in the model .",
    "the measured equation of state and spin - spin correlations , in lattice sizes up to @xmath0 , show clear signals for ps at intermediate interaction strengths . the nature of this spatially inhomogeneous state is examined .",
    "the hamiltonian for the one - band hubbard model is : @xmath5 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) at lattice site @xmath10 , and @xmath11 connects two nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "the square lattice has size @xmath12 , with @xmath13 spin-@xmath8 electrons .",
    "the model has only two parameters , the strength of the interaction @xmath14 ( we will set @xmath15 ) and the electron density @xmath16 .",
    "ps occurs when the stability condition @xmath17 is violated , where @xmath18 is the ground - state energy ( per site ) at density @xmath19 .",
    "the critical value of @xmath19 can be identified by maxwell construction .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that in the hubbard ( or @xmath20-@xmath21 ) model one could study @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the hole density : @xmath24 .",
    "if ps exists , there is a minimum in @xmath25 at @xmath26 ( or in the thermodynamic limit , a constant @xmath25 for @xmath27 ) @xcite .",
    "the signal for ps from eq .",
    "( [ holeenergy ] ) requires the slope of the equation of state , i.e. , accurate numerical determination of small energy differences in the region where @xmath23 is small . for a finite lattice ,",
    "the shape of the fermi surface varies considerably with @xmath19 , which causes large variations in the energy .",
    "for example , with the usual periodic boundary condition ( pbc ) , the smallest @xmath23 accessible by a closed - shell system is @xmath28 in a @xmath0 lattice @xcite ; even at @xmath29 the finite - size effect is still sizable , especially in the region relavant for ps ( see inset in fig .  [ ehole ] ) . to reduce shell and finite - size effects",
    ", we use twist - averaged boundary condition ( tabc)@xcite , under which the wave function @xmath30 gains a phase when electrons hop around lattice boundaries : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the unit vector along @xmath33 , and the twist angle @xmath34 is a parameter . with a generic @xmath35",
    ", there will be no degeneracy in the one - electron energy levels .",
    "we average the results over many random twist angles @xcite in each system for convergence . as shown in figs .",
    "[ egr ] and  [ ehole ] , tabc essentially eliminates any shell effect .",
    "the disadvantage is that it turns the qmc sign problem @xcite into a phase problem @xcite .      to treat this problem ,",
    "we extend the constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc ) method @xcite to a hamiltonian under tabc . for each given system ( specified by @xmath36 , @xmath19 , @xmath37 , and @xmath35 )",
    ", the method obtains a monte carlo ( mc ) representation of the many - body ground state @xmath38 , by importance - sampled branching random walks ( rws ) @xcite in the space of slater determinant wave functions .",
    "the usual sign problem under pbc is caused by the symmetry @xcite between a slater determinant @xmath39 and a degenerate partner @xmath40 ( exchanging two orbitals ) .",
    "to specify @xmath38 , we need either , but not both .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that constraining the rws to @xmath41 is an exact boundary condition that eliminates the sign problem . in the constrained path approximation ,",
    "a trial wave function @xmath42 is used in place of @xmath38 .    under tabc ,",
    "the slater determinants become complex , and we need to break the phase symmetry in @xmath39 .",
    "the hubbard - strotonivich transformation used in our calculations is the spin - decomposition of hirsch @xcite , which results in _ real _ ising - like auxiliary fields .",
    "the phase problem comes only from one - body hopping terms .",
    "we use a simple version of the phaseless approximation @xcite to constrain @xmath39 to a unique phase . at each step of propagation",
    ", the paths of the rws are required to satisfy : @xmath43 where @xmath39 and @xmath44 are the current and proposed positions .",
    "the left - hand side is used in the importance sampling @xcite .",
    "we use the free - electron wave function as @xmath42 . since this is an eigenfunction of the complex kinetic energy terms of @xmath45 , all the phase effect",
    "is absorbed in the _ deterministic _ one - body part .",
    "the condition on the rws is equivalent to the original constrained path approximation@xcite , to which eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) reduces if @xmath46 . the phase constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : constraint ] ) is the only approximation in our method .",
    "since the approximation involves only the overall sign / phase of the many - body wave function , it is reasonable to expect that the results will be relatively insensitive to @xmath42 .",
    "extensive benchmarks have shown this to be the case .",
    "the general approach has , in a variety of systems @xcite , given results among the most accurate that can be achieved presently from qmc .    as a quantative measure in the current case",
    ", we compare @xmath18 in @xmath47 hubbard lattices ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) between our method ( qmc ) and exact diagonalization ( ed ) . at each density ( both @xmath50 and the polarized case @xmath51 , with @xmath52 )",
    ", we calculate the ground - state energies for 1000 random @xmath35 values ( identical in qmc and ed ) , average the results , and estimate a statistical error bar . in the qmc results ,",
    "the error bar is the combined statistical errors from the random @xmath35 distribution and the qmc sampling , although the latter is much smaller compared to the former in this system .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ exact.vs.qmc ] .",
    "the agreement between qmc and exact results is excellent .",
    "the relative error @xmath53/|e_{\\rm ed}(n)|$ ] , shown in the bottom panel , is essentially zero for @xmath48 and is less than @xmath54 for @xmath55 , across the entire density range .",
    "our main energy results are summarized in fig.s  [ egr ] and [ ehole ] . in fig .",
    "[ egr ] , the equation of state is presented for several lattice sizes and interaction strengths . for densities @xmath56 , convergence of",
    "the averaged energy is rapid with respect to the set of random twists , and typically @xmath57 @xmath35 s is sufficient . for densities closer to half - filling",
    ", the energy has stronger fluctuations with @xmath35 .",
    "further , the requirement on statistical accuracy is higher in this region , because the error bar on @xmath25 is magnified by @xmath58 ( see eq .",
    "( [ holeenergy ] ) ) . in this case , the number of boundary conditions is increased ( to @xmath59-@xmath60 ) . in each region , the same set of random @xmath35 values are used to help correlate the results at different densities .",
    "the main graph shows results from a trotter time step @xmath61 ; the fit below [ eq .  ( [ eq : efit ] ) ] and results in the inset have been extrapolated to @xmath62 .",
    "convergence to the thermodynamic limit is seen with all three lattice sizes in the main graph .",
    "as the inset shows , @xmath63 and @xmath0 are indistinguishable to within statistical errors ( @xmath64 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ ehole ] , the hole energy @xmath25 derived from @xmath18 is plotted .",
    "the inset illustrates the large finite - size and shell effects under the usual pbc . because of degeneracies at the fermi surface , the hole energy has kinks and is a constant below a finite hole concentration@xcite .",
    "as the system size is increased , the @xmath25 curves show convergence , but only slowly .",
    "indeed a false signal for ps is seen in the non - interacting systems .",
    "these features are removed by tabc , with which a smooth monotonic curve is obtained .",
    "excellent convergence toward the thermodynamic limit is achieved with a @xmath63 lattice .",
    "interacting systems show similar behaviors : under pbc the same kinks appear in the @xmath18 vs.  @xmath19 curves @xcite for the interaction strengths considered here .",
    "the combination of cpmc and tabc leads to a dramatic improvement .",
    "the main panel of fig .",
    "[ ehole ] shows the hole energy for interacting systems .",
    "a clear minimum in @xmath25 can be seen at a finite hole density in all cases when @xmath65 . at @xmath48",
    ", @xmath26 is @xmath66-@xmath67 .",
    "as @xmath37 is increased , the position of the minimum is seen to shift to the right , i.e. , to a larger @xmath26 .",
    "as @xmath37 decreases to @xmath68 , @xmath25 appears to decrease monotonically down to @xmath69 , the lowest doping in these lattices , although it can not be completely ruled out a shallow ( @xmath70 from @xmath71 ) minimum exists within the statistical error bars .",
    "the energy results indicate that , near half - filling , the system phase - separates into a hole - free phase of density @xmath1 and a phase at @xmath72 . within a single phase",
    ", our results are expected to be at or near the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if the system is in a mixed state with two or more phases present , however , there are likely finite - size and/or interface effects .",
    "this appears to be the case from the data , where we see a minimum in the hole energy curves ( as opposed to a flat region ) , as well as size variations in @xmath25 in the hole density range @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , if the system is in a spatially inhomogeneous spin or charge density wave state with very long wavelength modulations , for example a stripelike state with only one stripe in a lattice of linear dimension up to @xmath74 , finite - size effects would likely make it indistinguishable from a phase - separated state in our calculations .    as a simple way to characterize the equation of state in the thermodynamic limit at @xmath75 , we fit the calculated @xmath18 on @xmath76 ( size @xmath77 only ) to a 4-th order polynomial . for @xmath48",
    "this gives @xmath78 statistical errors in the fitted coefficients are @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ egr ] shows the quality of the fit .      at @xmath1 ,",
    "the ground state is known to exhibit long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) order.@xcite doping introduces frustration and tends to destroy the af order . to see how this occurs and the relation to ps",
    ", we use the back - propagation technique@xcite to calculate the spin - spin correlation function : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a vector on the lattice and @xmath83 denotes expectation with respect to the ground state . the results for a @xmath63 lattice at @xmath48 , after twist - averaging , are shown in fig .",
    "af order is evident at @xmath1 , as expected .",
    "note that the magnitude of the long - range part is @xmath84 , and double occupancy of @xmath85 and @xmath86-electrons is significant , as the strength of the interaction @xmath37 is moderate .",
    "the long - range order decays rapidly with @xmath19 and , in the homogeneous phase , only short range correlation remains .",
    "( the minimum of @xmath25 is around @xmath87 in @xmath63 . )",
    "a more quantitative picture can be seen from the spin structure factor : @xmath88 .",
    "when the system has af order , @xmath89 will peak at @xmath90 .",
    "the calculated results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ sk ] , as a function of @xmath19 for three different lattice sizes .",
    "there is a marked difference between the small and larger doping regions . below a critical density ( @xmath91 )",

    "@xmath92 increases quickly as @xmath19 approaches @xmath93 . as the inset illustrates , at each density",
    "@xmath92 grows proportionally with system size , suggesting the presence of long - range af order .",

    ", @xmath96 is averaged over imaginary - time and mc configurations .",
    "an af cluster of linear dimension @xmath97 should , due to `` winding '' around the periodic lattice , have a finite , constant tail @xmath98 beyond @xmath99 , while a smaller cluster should have a tail at zero beyond @xmath100 .",
    "our @xmath96 results are consistent with this . in @xmath63 ,",
    "finite resolution gives only a handful of densities on the interval @xmath101 , so @xmath102 is close to either @xmath103 or @xmath104 , and we see long plateaus .",

    "[ spin ] shows @xmath0 lattices , focusing on several densities near @xmath2 . at @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 , but the former ( large @xmath102 ) has a long flat tail while the latter shows a decline with @xmath108 in the middle , indicating reduced contributions in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defcr ] ) .",
