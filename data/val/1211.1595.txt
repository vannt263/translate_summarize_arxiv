    "consider a game in which the player s goal is to force a brownian particle out of an interval ( say @xmath0 $ ] ) as quickly as possible . at each instant",
    ", the player selects one of two opposite constant forces , either upwards or downwards , which adds or subtracts a constant drift @xmath1 to the brownian motion .",
    "the player is allowed to switch between the two forces at any time , but at each switch , he incurs a penalty of @xmath2 units of time ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the goal is to find a strategy that minimizes the expected penalized time , that is , the sum of the time needed for the particle to exit the interval and the switching penalties (  optimal expulsion problem \" ) .",
    "we also solve the `` opposite '' problem , in which the goal is to keep the particle inside the interval for as long as possible , subject to the same kind of switching penalty , which is now subtracted from the time to exit the interval (  optimal confinement problem \" ) .",
    "these two abstract problems can be viewed in the context of various applications , such as maintaining an inventory between certain bounds by controlling the production rate @xcite , or maintaining an insurance company s capital reserve between two bounds by controlling the insurance premium @xcite . in certain asymptotic limits",
    ", these quantities may behave like a brownian motion , and a change of production rate or of premium may entail a switching cost .",
    "the two boundaries may represent certain levels that one may want to reach as soon ( or as late ) as possible .",
    "the presence of the switching cost is the key issue here : for instance , prokhorov @xcite solves a similar problem but without cost penalty , and mandl  @xcite treats a control problem for a brownian motion under a constraint on the number of switchings . when there is no switching cost , then the solutions of these problems are well - known ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there is a well - developed literature for studying this kind of stochastic control problem , including @xcite .",
    "most frequently , these problems involve terminal costs and running costs .",
    "more recently , even more general kinds of performance criteria have been considered , as in  @xcite , where the criterion also involves the running maximum of the observed process . in the presence of a switching cost",
    ", the problem falls into the theory of impulse control , as described for instance in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 6 ) .    in order to solve our two control problems , we begin by formulating a free boundary problem for the value function .",
    "this involves splitting the state space into two regions , a _ continuation _ region and a _ switching _ region .",
    "the particular form of the regions is guessed from the description of the problem . in the continuation region ,",
    "the value function solves certain ordinary differential equations , and in the complement of this region , the value function satisfies a relationship related to the switching cost .",
    "there are also boundary conditions at the extremities of the interval . in general , this system of equations is _ not _ sufficient to characterize the value function , and this is indeed the case here : it is necessary to specify appropriate additional conditions at the free boundaries between the regions , which we do using the so - called _ principle of smooth fit _ ( see for example @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3.4 ) ) .",
    "this approach has a long history , going back to @xcite , and , more recently , @xcite , and has proved to be quite successful in a wide range of problems , including , in addition to those in the references just mentioned , the problem of optimal switching ( without cost ) between two brownian motions @xcite .",
    "other examples of optimal switching problems related to ours and with explicit solutions can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the problems considered in these papers differ from ours in particular because the state space is either the real line or the half - line , and there are no boundary conditions .    in our problem ,",
    "if the switching cost is high enough , then , obviously , one should switch drifts rarely or not at all , and in fact , it turns out that there is a critical value @xmath4 , which turns out to be the same in both the expulsion and confinement problems , above which it is optimal never to switch drifts .",
    "we compute this value explicitly , and then we show that for costs @xmath5 , the optimal strategy is determined by four thresholds that are the endpoints of the switching regions .",
    "we determine these thresholds explicitly , up to the resolution of a single transcendental equation ( in each problem ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : solution ] , we give the precise formulation of the optimal expulsion and confinement problems , we guess the form of the continuation and switching regions in order to state the free boundary problems and their solutions , we identify the critical cost @xmath4 , and we present our main results concerning the value functions and the description of the optimal controls . in section [ sec :",
    "proofs ] , we solve the free boundary problems , by considering first the case @xmath6 , and then use this for the cases @xmath7 and @xmath8 . using the _ verification method , _",
    "we prove that the solutions are indeed the value functions , by identifying a process that plays the role of snell s envelope @xcite : it is a sub- ( or super- ) martingale for all strategies and a martingale for the optimal strategy .",
    "this proof makes use of the local time - space formula of @xcite .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : further ] , we identify the consequences of a suboptimal action , which allows us to show that the optimal solutions are generically unique ( except in the critical case @xmath9 , where there are two distinct optimal solutions ) , and we study the limiting case @xmath10 , from which we recover the zero - cost case of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath11 be a standard brownian motion , defined on a probability space @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 a.s .",
    ", let @xmath14 be its natural filtration and let @xmath15 denote the set of all @xmath16-adapted processes that are right continuous , piecewise constant and take values in @xmath17 .",
    "the elements of @xmath15 are the _ strategies _ available to the player .",
    "we consider a control model in which the system s state is given by the stochastic differential equation @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is a given positive constant .",

    "thus , if the cost exceeds a certain value , then a reasonable player will never pay this cost to change the initial drift .",
    "this value is given by the maximal difference between the expected exit time from @xmath0 $ ] of a brownian motion starting at @xmath48 with a constant drift @xmath1 or @xmath49 .",
    "namely , for @xmath50 , set @xmath510,1[\\,\\}$ ] and @xmath52 .",
    "then , by taking the derivative at @xmath29 of the moment - generating function of a brownian motion with drift ( see  ( * ? ? ?",

    "this maximum is attained at @xmath57    the third property concerns the general shape of the optimal strategy .",
    "indeed , consider two scenarios in the minimization problem .",
    "assume first that one starts near @xmath58 with a positive drift .",
    "the player will keep this favorable drift for a while . if the particle goes down , then when it reaches @xmath59 , both drifts are equivalent because of the symmetry property . since the player is subject to a switching penalty",
    ", he will keep the positive drift .",
    "if the particle keeps going down , then it will become more advantageous to change to a negative drift so that the particle will exit more quickly through @xmath29 .",
    "secondly , if one starts close to @xmath29 with a positive drift , then the diffusive behavior of the particle makes it very likely that it will rapidly hit @xmath29 even if the drift is in the unfavorable direction .",
    "thus , it is probably not worthwhile to pay the penalty to change the drift .",
    "these two facts are summarized by the following property : + * property @xmath60 . *",
