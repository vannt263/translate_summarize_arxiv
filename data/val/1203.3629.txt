    "while graphene@xcite has proven to be a remarkable material , with electronic properties that are interesting from a fundamental@xcite as well as a technological viewpoint,@xcite the absence of a band gap severely limits its possible applications .",
    "several methods have been proposed for opening a gap in graphene . relying on quantum confinement effects ,",
    "the most immediate way of making graphene semiconducting is by reducing the dimensionality by cutting graphene into narrow ribbons .",
    "such so - called graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) have band gaps that in general scale inversely with the width of the gnr , but which are very sensitive to the exact geometry of the edge of the ribbon.@xcite related to these ideas , periodically perforated graphene , termed graphene antidot lattices , effectively result in a network of ribbons , and has been shown to be an efficient way of inducing an appreciable band gap in graphene .",
    "@xcite this idea has been successfully applied to fabricate simple graphene - based semiconductor devices.@xcite modifying graphene via adsorption of hydrogen presents another route towards opening a gap in graphene , with fully hydrogenated graphene exhibiting a band gap of several electron volts,@xcite while patterned hydrogen adsorption yields band structures resembling those of graphene antidot lattices , with reported band gaps of at least @xmath0  mev.@xcite    the prospect of opening a band gap in graphene via electrostatic gating is intriguing , since it would allow for switching between semi - metallic and semiconducting behavior and to dynamically alter the band gap to fit specific applications .",
    "this makes it significantly more flexible than proposals relying on structural modification of graphene .",
    "however , a linearization of the tight - binding hamiltonian of graphene , resulting in the now widely studied dirac equation ( de ) of graphene,@xcite suggests that the dirac fermions of graphene can not be confined by electrostatic gating , due to the phenomenon of klein tunneling.@xcite thus , while periodic gating of usual semiconductor heterostructures such as , e.g. , gaas quantum wells , does induce gaps in the dispersion relation,@xcite previous theoretical studies have indicated that band gaps are induced for neither one - dimensional @xcite nor two - dimensional@xcite periodic gating of graphene .",
    "these studies have taken as their starting point the dirac model of graphene , which is a low - energy continuum model , ignoring atomistic details . here , we instead use a more accurate tight - binding ( tb ) model to study periodically gated graphene .",
    "contrary to predictions of continuum ( dirac ) models , the tb model suggests that it is indeed possible to open a band gap in graphene via periodic gating .",
    "the aim of this paper is two - fold : ( i ) to compare periodically gated graphene with graphene antidot lattices . in doing so",
    "we will illustrate that , contrary to what may be expected from the dirac equation , a sufficiently large scalar potential , i.e. , not necessarily a mass term , yields a band structure that is highly similar to that of perforated graphene structures ; ( ii ) to serve as a feasibility study of periodic gating as a means of inducing a band gap in graphene . to this end",
    ", we will illustrate and discuss the non - trivial dependence of the band gap on the gate potential , as well as the intricate relation between band gap and the edge geometry of the gated region .",
    "these results will also serve to illustrate some of the key differences between graphene and ordinary two - dimensional electron gases .",
    "while , initially , the potential will be modeled as a simple step function , we will show below that introducing smoothing in the potential distribution severely reduces the attainable band gap .",
    "continuum and atomistic models of periodically gated graphene have previously been compared in ref .  .",
    "that study , however , focused on a single value of the potential strength and only considered structures that are rotated @xmath1 compared to the ones of the present work and , therefore , do not necessarily display any band gap even for perforated structures.@xcite moreover , in this work we examine in detail the non - trivial dependence of the band gap on the magnitude of the potential and we consider more realistic , smooth potential profiles .",

    "an important decision lies in the choice of the angle between the basis vectors of the superlattice and the carbon - carbon bonds in graphene . in particular , if the superlattice basis vectors are rotated @xmath1 compared to the carbon - carbon bonds ( such as in ref .  )",
    ", clar sextet theory predicts that perforated graphene structures only exhibit significant band gaps for every third value of the side length of the hexagonal unit cell.@xcite in contrast to this , perforated graphene structures with basis vectors parallel to the carbon - carbon bonds always have band gaps .",
    "we choose to focus in this paper on the latter geometries , in order to ensure that the superlattice symmetry in itself does not prohibit the emergence of a band gap .",
    "we characterize a given structure by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the side length of the hexagonal unit cell , while @xmath6 is the radius of the central region , both in units of the graphene lattice constant , as illustrated in fig .",

    "below , we discuss in detail the crucial dependence of the results on the edge geometry",
    ". we will consider four distinct ways of periodically modifying graphene : ( a ) perforated graphene ( graphene antidot lattices ) , with carbon atoms removed from the central region , ( b ) a periodic mass term , non - zero only in the central region , and ( c ) periodically gated graphene , with a constant gate potential within the central region and a vanishing potential outside .",
    "furthermore , to discuss the feasibility of realizing gapped graphene via periodic gating , we will also consider ( d ) periodically gated graphene , with a more realistic model of the spatial dependence of the gate potential , obtained from a solution to the laplace equation .",
    "focus will be on periodically gated graphene , with the other forms of modulation included for comparison only .    to illustrate the dependence of the results on the exact edge of the gate or mass region , we will use a dirac model as well as a more accurate tight - binding treatment , in which the atomistic details of the structures are included .",

    "we include only nearest - neighbor coupling between @xmath21 orbitals , parametrized via the hopping term @xmath22 , with @xmath23  ev .",
    "we ignore the overlap between neighboring @xmath21 orbitals , assuming that our basis is orthogonal , and set the on - site energy of the @xmath21 orbitals to zero .",
    "this parametrization accurately reproduces the fermi velocity of graphene , and is also in quantitative agreement with density functional theory when applied to perforated graphene structures.@xcite for periodically gated graphene , we set the diagonal terms of the hamiltonian equal to the gate potential . in the case of a mass term ,",
    "the diagonal terms become @xmath24 , with the sign depending on which sublattice the carbon atom resides on . for perforated graphene ,",
    "atoms are removed entirely in the region of the hole , ensuring that no dangling bonds are created .",
    "while including next - nearest neighbor coupling , as well as taking into account the non - orthogonality of the basis set , will change our results quantitatively , we expect the overall trends and the conclusions to remain the same in more accurate models .",

    "[ fig : bandl12r5hole ] we show the band structure for a @xmath26 graphene antidot lattice , i.e. , periodically perforated graphene , and compare to the case of a periodic mass term , modeled using either the tb or the de approach .",
    "a sufficiently large mass term should ensure that electrons are excluded entirely from the region of the mass term , and we thus expect relatively good correspondence with perforated graphene . in the figure , we consider the case where the mass term is equal in size to the tb hopping term , @xmath25 .",
    "as expected , we find quite good agreement between all three methods .",
    "in particular , the magnitudes of the band gaps are in near - perfect agreement . using a finite , but sufficiently large mass term in the de model thus yields much better results than models where the limit of infinite mass term is used to impose boundary conditions on the edge of the hole in the de model.@xcite",

    "the differences between the de and tb results become more pronounced , as the linear approximation of the de model breaks down .",
    "further , comparing the case of perforated graphene to that of a periodic mass term in the tb model , we see significant differences in the higher - lying bands . however , we note that increasing the mass term further results in excellent agreement with the perforated graphene case , for all bands shown .     lattice .",

    "contrary to this , analysis of periodic potentials in a de model of graphene suggests that periodic gating does _ not _ induce a gap in graphene around the fermi level,@xcite but rather leads to the generation of new dirac points near the superlattice brillouin zone boundaries.@xcite superlattices lacking inversion symmetry have been suggested as a means of achieving tunable band gaps in graphene , based on results using a de model.@xcite however , these results were recently found to be based on numerical errors.@xcite indeed , based on the de model , a gap can not be produced by any hamiltonian that preserves time - reversal symmetry , i.e. @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the pauli spin matrix while @xmath33 denotes the complex conjugate ( not the hermitian conjugate ) of the hamiltonian.@xcite a pure scalar potential , such as the one we consider for periodically gated graphene , see eq .  ( [ eq : de ] ) , preserves this symmetry and the de model thus suggests that periodic gating does _ not _ open a band gap . instead , a combination of a scalar as well as a vector potential is needed.@xcite    in fig .

    "contrary to a periodic mass term we see that , as could be expected , periodic gating breaks electron - hole symmetry and shifts the fermi level to higher energies . comparing de and tb results , we note that there is quite good agreement overall , between the two methods .",
    "however , a crucial difference emerges when considering the bands in close vicinity of the fermi level , as illustrated in the inset : while the de results suggest that periodic gating does not open a band gap , tb results demonstrate that a band gap _ does _ occur right at the fermi level .",

    "as the gate potential is increased further , these states become less energetically favorable , and are eventually all situated at energies well above the fermi level . in stark contrast to this",

    "in fact , as the mass term is increased , states nearly entirely localized within the mass term region develop at both extrema of the spectrum .",

    "the resulting curves emerge as simple scaled versions of each other , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapvsgate ] . while , initially , raising the gate potential increases the band gap , a maximum gap is reached at a certain gate potential , after which the band gap diminishes .",
    "this behavior is completely different from the case where the potential is replaced by a mass term , as illustrated in the inset of the figure . in this case",
    ", the band gap continues to increase until a saturation point is reached in the limit where the structure resembles that of perforated graphene . while the three periodic lattices indicated with solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapvsgate ] result in similar dependencies of the gap on @xmath41 , we stress that this is _ not _ the case for all lattices , even if the ratio @xmath38 is approximately the same . to illustrate this",
    ", we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapvsgate ] results for the @xmath42 lattice .",
    "the dependence of the band gap on gate potential differs markedly for this lattice .",
    "this indicates that the exact geometry at the edge of the gate region plays a large role in determining the band gap , in agreement with findings in ref .  .       with varying @xmath6 .",
    "below @xmath43 all gaps are direct ( @xmath29@xmath29 ) . above this transition",
    "the @xmath29@xmath29 gaps ( dashed lines ) exceed the indirect @xmath29@xmath44 gap .",
    "the unit cells of the @xmath45 lattices are shown above , in order of increasing radius . the edge geometry is highlighted . ]    to illustrate in more detail the role of the edge in determining the band gap , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapvsgatel7 ] the band gap as a function of the gate potential , for lattices @xmath45 with increasing values of @xmath6 .",
    "the radius is increased in the minimum steps resulting in new geometries .",
    "the structures with @xmath46 show quite similar behaviors .",
    "in particular , a maximum band gap is reached at @xmath47 in all three cases .",
    "the band gap then closes , but reopens once more as the gate potential is increased further . around @xmath43",
    "the band gap changes from direct ( @xmath29@xmath29 ) to indirect ( @xmath29@xmath44 ) as the gate voltage is raised .",
    "the dashed lines in the figure illustrate the @xmath29@xmath29 gap above the direct to indirect - gap transition .",
    "however , after a slight further increase of the gate voltage , the final closing of the band gap occurs as the energy at the @xmath44 point moves below that at the @xmath29 point , resulting in crossing bands at the fermi level .",
    "finally , we note that while the three lattices show similar behavior , the dependence of the band gap on the radius of the gate region is clearly not monotonic , and a larger gate region does not necessarily result in a larger band gap .",
    "in contrast to the similarities of the other three structures , the dependence of the band gap on the gate potential for the @xmath37 lattice differs greatly . in the upper panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : gapvsgatel7 ] we show the unit cells corresponding to the @xmath45 lattices considered , with the edge geometries highlighted . the @xmath37 lattice stands out from the rest of the geometries , in that the entire edge of the gate region is made up from several pure zigzag edges . we stress that the sublattice imbalance for the entire edge is zero , while there is a local sublattice imbalance on the individual straight zigzag edges .",
    "in contrast to this , the other geometries have gate regions with zigzag as well as armchair edges .",
    "we find that the general trend is for zigzag edges to quench the band gap of the periodically gated graphene structures , which we have also verified via calculations of gate regions of hexagonal symmetry , which always have pure zigzag edges .",
    "this trend can be explained by noting that pure zigzag edges , such as , e.g. , in zigzag graphene nanoribbons @xcite or graphene antidot lattices with triangular holes @xcite , lead to localized midgap states.@xcite for periodically gated graphene the edge is defined by a finite potential , rather than a complete absence of carbon atoms , so we expect the tendency of electrons to localize on the edge to be less pronounced .",
    "nevertheless , our findings suggest that local zigzag geometry still has the effect of quenching the band gap .",
    "since , in general , larger circular holes will have longer regions of zigzag geometry at the edge of the gate region , this explains why larger gate regions will not invariably lead to larger band gaps . in the present case ,",
    "we note that the @xmath48 structure indeed has a significantly smaller band gap than the @xmath49 structure .",
    "the @xmath50 lattice is unique in that the equivalent of dangling bonds are present at the edge of the gate region , which further decrease the magnitude of the band gap .       showing the band gap .",
    "note that the overlaps of the two states are equal exactly when the band gap is at a maximum , as highlighted for the @xmath51 lattice with the vertical black line .",
    "the left ( right ) inset illustrates schematically the dependence of the conduction and valence band edges on the gate potential , in the regime where the overlap with the gate of the state at the valence band edge is smaller ( larger ) than that of the state at the conductance band edge . ]",
    "first - order perturbation theory suggests that the dependence of the energy of the eigenstate on the gate potential be proportional to the overlap of the state with the gate region , i.e. , @xmath52 . we thus expect the overlap with the gate region of the two eigenstates closest to the fermi level to be a crucial parameter in describing the opening and quenching of the band gap as the gate voltage is varied .",
    "we will also see that it illustrates the crucial differences between graphene and ordinary two - dimensional electron gases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : olvsv ] we show the overlap of the eigenstate with the gate region as a function of the magnitude of the potential .",
    "the overlap is shown for the eigenstates at the valence and conduction band edges , and normalized by the ratio between gate and unit cell areas .",
    "a value of one thus indicates that the overlap with the gate region is the same as if the eigenstate is evenly distributed throughout the unit cell , while a value larger ( smaller ) than one suggests that the eigenstate is localized predominantly inside ( outside ) the gate region . as we saw also in fig .",
    "[ fig : adoverlap ] , the states near the fermi level both have quite large overlaps with the gate region , even when the potential is of the order of the tb hopping term .",
    "initially , for low values of the gate potential , the overlap with the gate region of the unoccupied state in the conduction band is larger than the corresponding overlap of the occupied state in the valence band . relying on first - order perturbation theory",
    "we thus expect the energy of the conductance band state to increase more strongly with the gate potential than the valence band state , resulting in a larger band gap as the gate potential is raised , as illustrated in the left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : olvsv ] .",
    "however , contrary to what would be expected for an ordinary two - dimensional electron gas , we see that as the potential is increased further , the valence band state also becomes localized predominantly within the gate region .",
    "indeed , eventually the overlap of the valence band state with the gate region becomes larger than the one of the conduction band state , which results in a quenching of the band gap as the potential is increased further , as illustrated in the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : olvsv ] .",
    "we note that the point where the overlap of the two states with the gate region become equal exactly matches the point where the band gap is at a maximum .",
    "this is illustrated by the vertical , black line in the figure .",
    "the strong influence of the exact edge geometry is apparent , manifesting itself in a qualitatively different dependence of the overlap on gate voltage for the @xmath37 lattice . in particular , while the gate region overlap of the valence band state of the @xmath51 and @xmath48 lattices initially decreases with the size of the potential , both valence and conduction band states immediately start localizing within the gate region for the @xmath37 structure .",
    "this leads to much faster quenching of the initial band gap .",
    "as we have illustrated above , the band gap of periodically gated graphene depends strongly on the edge geometry at the boundary between the gated and the non - gated region .",
    "so far , we have used a simple step function to model the spatial dependence of the potential due to the gate .",
    "however , it is obvious that in actual realizations of periodically gated graphene , some form of smoothing of the potential will inevitably be present . due to the intricate relationship between the band gap and the edge geometry , it is relevant to investigate the effect of smoothing out the potential . in particular",
    ", since the de model predicts no gap at all , one may wonder whether smoothing will cause the gap to close entirely .",
    "previous studies have included smoothing of the gate potential , but with a smearing distance of the order @xmath53",
    ",@xcite small enough that an atomically resolved edge can still be defined .    to model a more realistic gate potential",
    ", we use an analytical expression for the potential distribution resulting from a constant potential disk in an insulating plane , obtained by direct solution of the laplace equation . in cylindrical coordinates , this reads as@xcite @xmath54 with @xmath55 the distance above the gate , while @xmath56 is the distance from the center of the disk .",
    "note that for @xmath57 the expression simplifies to @xmath58 for @xmath59 while @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "of course , more exact approaches such as , e.g. , finite - element methods , could be used to determine the potential distribution from a realistic back gate .",
    "however , we choose to use this relatively simple analytical expression , since we are mainly interested in discussing the general trends that occur as the edge of the potential region becomes less well - defined .",
    "one could imagine more elaborate setups that would generate sharper potential distributions .",
    "to include such possibilities , we consider a modified potential distribution @xmath62^\\eta$ ] , with the additional parameter @xmath63 , which allows us to control the smoothing of the potential further .",
    "as @xmath64 we approach the limit where the potential is described by a heaviside step function , as in the results presented so far .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) is derived for an isolated constant potential disk rather than a periodic array of gates .",
    "ignoring coupling between the different gates , one simple way of improving this model would be to add the potentials generated from the nearest - neighbor gates , to account for the overlap between them .",
    "however , this would merely serve to smoothen out the potential further , as well as add a constant background potential , effectively decreasing the height of the potential barrier . here",
    ", we are interested in illustrating the critical dependence of the band gap on smoothing out the potential , so we are adopting a ` best case ' scenario , which also means that we will use @xmath57 throughout , assuming that the graphene layer is deposited directly on the periodic gates , with no insulating layer in - between .     periodically gated graphene lattice .",
    "the potential distribution due to the periodic gates is modelled via eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) .",
    "we assume the distance from the plane of the gate to the graphene layer is zero .",
    "results are shown for increased values of the @xmath63 parameter , which determines the strength of the smoothing .",
    "the inset illustrates the potential distribution @xmath65 for each case , with markers indicating the radial position of the carbon atoms . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : gapvsgatesmooth ] we show the band gap for a @xmath26 lattice as a function of gate potential , for increased values of the @xmath63 parameter .",
    "while for @xmath64 , corresponding to a heaviside step function distribution , the maximum band gap is about @xmath66  mev , the band gap for @xmath67 is drastically lower , with a maximum value of only @xmath68  mev .",
    "as we artificially decrease the amount of smoothing by raising the value of @xmath63 , we slowly recover the maximum band gap attainable . however , we stress that even for @xmath69 , which as shown in the inset of the figure amounts to smoothing over a range of little more than a single carbon atom , the maximum band gap has decreased by more than 20% from the value at @xmath64 .",
    "this suggests that the band gap does indeed critically depend on an edge effect , which is very quickly washed out as the potential step is smoothed out over several carbon atoms .",
    "this is in agreement with previous studies , which have indicated that intervalley scattering is crucial in describing the band gap of periodically gated graphene.@xcite in order for a scalar potential to induce intervalley scattering , it must vary significantly on a scale of the carbon - carbon distance , so that a local sublattice asymmetry is introduced .",
    "by employing a tight - binding description of graphene , we have shown that , contrary to what is predicted on basis of a continuum model , it is indeed possible to induce a band gap in graphene via periodic , electrostatic gating .",
    "further , if the magnitude of the potential is made sufficiently large , periodically gated graphene is an accurate model for perforated graphene structures , with one caveat , namely that the fermi level is far removed from the location of the band gap . for smaller , more realistic values of the gate potential",
    ", a band gap appears right at the fermi level .",
    "however , we find that the band gap is orders of magnitude smaller than that of the corresponding perforated graphene structure .",
    "the dependence of the band gap on the gate potential is highly non - trivial , and entirely different from the case where graphene is modulated by a periodic mass term . in particular , a maximum magnitude of the band gap is reached , after which increasing the gate potential further quenches the gap .",
    "also , a transition from a direct ( @xmath29@xmath29 ) to an indirect ( @xmath29@xmath44 ) semiconductor occurs for larger gate potentials . the exact magnitude and dependence of the band gap on gate potential depends critically on the precise geometry of the edge of the gate region . in particular , large regions of local zigzag geometries tend to result in significantly smaller band gaps than geometries where armchair edges dominate .",
    "because the emergence of a band gap relies on a local sublattice asymmetry , we find that it is extremely fragile .",
    "if smoothing is introduced in the potential distribution , such that the edge of the gate region is no longer atomically resolved , the magnitude of the band gap drops significantly . even if the smoothing occurs over a range of little more than a single carbon atom , we find that the maximum band gap decreases to less than 80% of the value for a perfectly defined edge .",
