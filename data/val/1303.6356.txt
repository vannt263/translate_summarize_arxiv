    "optical nonlinearities , such as the kerr effect , have great importance in both fundamental and technological sciences .",
    "the conventional way of obtaining an optical nonlinearity is through an intensity - dependant interaction between light and matter @xcite .",
    "for instance , a self - kerr interaction naturally occurs in an optical glass fiber , inducing an intensity - dependant phase shift upon a propagating light pulse",
    ". however , such natural kerr nonlinearities are extremely weak and a possible accumulation of the nonlinear interaction through a sufficiently long interaction time , e.g. via a long - lasting pulse propagation over a long fiber segment , is impossible due to the dominating effect of accumulating linear losses ( however , see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "thus , research on optical nonlinearities is typically based on having an exotic medium with special optical properties in order to realize a more robust , though still usually fairly weak nonlinear interaction between the medium and the light field .",
    "this research field is very active and produces various promising results @xcite .",
    "most recently , rather strong kerr - type couplings were achieved in electro - optical circuit qed systems @xcite .",
    "there is also the more recent approach of measurement - induced nonlinearities .",
    "the most prominent example for this is an efficient linear - optics quantum computation scheme that relies on entangled multi - photon ancilla states ( in order to become near - deterministic ) and photon counting @xcite .",
    "this approach works on the single - photon level and uses discrete - variable qubit - type encoding .",
    "however , there are also measurement - based proposals to implement a so - called continuous - variable ( cv ) cubic phase gate ( the hardest gate to implement from the cv universal gate set ) , which , in principle , can be applied upon an arbitrary optical single - mode state @xcite .",
    "a very recent result is the experimental demonstration of such a ( weak ) cubic phase gate @xcite .",
    "this particular demonstration is the key to engineer an arbitrary nonlinear interaction , since any other elementary cv gate besides the cubic phase gate is a gaussian operation and hence fairly easy to realize @xcite .",
    "however , current theoretical work on using measurement - induced , elementary nonlinear gates to obtain more useful nonlinear hamiltonians , such as the kerr effect , has been still insufficient with regards to an actual experimental implementation .    in this work ,",
    "we present an alternative method to the medium - based kerr nonlinearities and demonstrate obtaining the kerr nonlinearity in a measurement - based fashion within a few measurement steps .",
    "our implementation of the kerr gate is independent of the input state and works , in principle , for arbitrary optical states .",
    "interestingly , in contrast to the medium - based schemes , our approach works best on the level of individual photons .",
    "our scheme could be more generally referred to as measurement - induced hamiltonian engineering , however , here we shall only focus on the important example of the kerr interaction .",
    "the main theoretical background consists of the recently developed nonlinear - gate decomposition idea @xcite combined with an approximate implementation of the cubic phase gate @xcite .",
    "however , besides combining them , we also extend these two ideas , presenting a rather new approach in order to avoid any redundant steps for both decomposing the kerr interaction and preparing the ancilla states . as a result",
    ", we will be able to realize the kerr gate using a very small number of steps ( that is between 4 and 10 steps , as opposed to the tens of steps needed in the original scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for implementing the elementary interactions , which are slightly more general than the common universal cv gates , we apply the measurement - based ( cluster - based ) model proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we first show that four elementary interactions are enough for realizing the full self(single - mode)-kerr interaction with an interaction strength around the same magnitude as the medium - based kerr nonlinearities .",
    "however , in order to implement these four interactions in a measurement - based and deterministic fashion using elementary cv cluster teleportations , six additional correction operations are needed . by incorporating these corrections into the measurement - based protocol , in total ten teleportations will be required .",
    "since the elementary operations are of cubic and quartic order in the mode operators and hence correspond to non - gaussian operations , in the original cv cluster - based model @xcite , the correction operations would correspond to quadratic squeezing and further non - gaussian operations , which must be taken into account in the choice of the measurement bases at each step of the cluster computation . in our ancilla - based model ,",
    "however , the measurements are always homodyne detections , and for the at most cubic correction operations , suitable cubic ancilla states have to be prepared depending on the previous measurement steps .",
    "when the approximate , heralded single - photon - based ancilla states are employed @xcite for this purpose , it would mean that the quantum information to be processed in the cluster has to be temporarily stored in a quantum memory @xcite .",
    "without such a memory our proposal would be probabilistic . however , if one has access to an efficient quantum memory , our weak - kerr scheme could be also concatenated in order to implement a strong kerr interaction .",
    "these concatenations would accumulate the errors from each weak - kerr scheme though , and thus , for a strong - kerr scheme to attain still high fidelities , the gate decompositions of the weak - kerr schemes have to be refined through higher - order approximations , as we will show .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ gate_implementation ] , we describe the measurement - based model of refs .  @xcite . then , in sec .",
    "[ decomposing_the_kerr_gate ] , we present a new approach to decomposing a nonlinear interaction and apply it to the kerr interaction . after this , in sec .",
    "[ approximatingthecubic ] , we will describe an experimental proposal for the necessary ancilla states and provide an explicit recipe for the implementation of the kerr interaction . in sec .",
    "[ examples ] , we test our scheme by applying the resulting decompositions to different input states and comparing the outgoing states with those obtainable via the exact evolutions . then , in sec .",
    "[ higherorders ] , we present a guideline to obtain higher - order decompositions and , finally , in sec .",
    "[ higherkerr ] , we briefly discuss the possibility of a strong kerr interaction .    throughout , we use capital letters and hats for operators and small letters for scalars and functions . in equations ,",
    "the letter @xmath0 is used only as the square root of -1 .",
    "the notation @xmath1 $ ] is used for the commutation of the operators @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we use the convention @xmath4 , i.e. , the fundamental commutation relation is @xmath5=i/2 $ ] with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "for the experimental implementation of the required operators , we use the teleportation - based model of refs .  @xcite . according to this model",
    ", it is possible to teleport elementary interaction hamiltonians ( gates ) that are diagonal in @xmath8 , including rotated versions of them , onto an arbitrary input state using gaussian coupling , homodyne detections , and an appropriate set of ancilla states .",
    "assume that we have the ( single - mode ) state @xmath9 that we want to transform , and the operator we intend to apply is @xmath10 , which is an operator diagonal in @xmath8 .",
    "we aim to obtain the state @xmath11 , where @xmath12 in order to obtain the state @xmath13 , we couple the input state @xmath9 to an offline - prepared ( single - mode ) state @xmath14 using the gaussian coupling operator @xmath15 , where the subscripts refer to the two modes . this coupling can be exactly implemented by beam splitters and squeezing operations @xcite .",
    "then we make a @xmath16 homodyne detection on the input mode ( mode 1 ) , which yields the state @xmath17 in mode 2 with @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the measurement result of the homodyne detection .",
    "equation   can be written as follows , @xmath20 here , the operator @xmath21 is the fourier transform operator defined as follows , @xmath22 which can be used to transform the operators in @xmath8 to operators in @xmath16 and vice versa by unitary conjugation , @xmath23 to obtain the desired state from the output state , we need to apply further correction operations . for this purpose ,",
    "eq .   can be written as follows , @xmath24 then we implement a correction operator @xmath25 , @xmath26 which coincides with the desired final state @xmath13 up to the inverse fourier transform @xmath27 , and where @xmath28 for example , when we want to implement the cubic phase gate , @xmath29 , we need the following gaussian correction operator , @xmath30 for the quartic gate @xmath31 , we need a cubic correction operator , @xmath32 note that the displacement operations , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , can be realized by just coupling a bright light beam with the signal state through a beam splitter .    now in order to get rid of the inverse fourier transform in @xmath35 , one possible strategy would be to first apply a fourier transform upon the input state , @xmath36 , prior to running it through the above protocol .",
    "this eventually gives the desired output state , @xmath37 .",
    "applying a fourier transform in a measurement - based fashion is very easy : it just means teleporting the input state in a single , elementary step using one of the canonical ancilla states for approximate cv cluster computation , namely a @xmath16 squeezed vacuum state @xcite .",
    "another strategy is to leave the inverse fourier transform in the final states of the protocol and modify the interaction sequence in accordance to this .",
    "for example , suppose we want to teleport the four operators @xmath38 onto the initial state @xmath9 .",
    "we may then teleport the modified operators @xmath39 onto the input and we obtain the final state , @xmath40 where @xmath41 while the operators @xmath38 are assumed to be diagonal in either @xmath8 or @xmath16 , the operators @xmath39 are straightforward to derive .",
    "all arguments used in this section for operators diagonal in @xmath8 also hold in a similar way for the operators diagonal in @xmath16 .",
    "the general problem in decomposing a given interaction is to implement the desired operator using a limited set of experimentally available operators . in our previous work @xcite ,",
    "we presented a systematic and efficient recipe for this , however , in order to optimize these decompositions even further with regards to an experimental implementation , here we shall use a slightly different approach .",
    "we will avoid any specific operator approximations such as splitting and ( nested ) commutator approximations , as employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and instead utilize a more brute force approach especially tailored for the kerr interaction .",
    "this approach also has a greater flexibility for choosing the order of the operators , which turns out to be beneficial in reducing the number of experimental steps when additional correction operations are needed later on .",
    "let us first define the kerr interaction as @xmath42-i\\frac{1}{6}t\\right)}e^{-it\\left(x^2+p^2-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\propto e^{t\\left(ix^4+ip^4+\\frac{4}{9}[x^3,p^3]\\right)}\\,.\\label{eq : kerr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , at the beginning , compared to the standard self - kerr interaction @xmath43 , with the number operator @xmath44 , we omitted the gaussian phase - rotation operation @xmath45 ; and also in the last line we omitted that phase rotation and another global phase factor for simplicity .",
    "gaussian operators are considered as relatively easy to implement and they have been already achieved experimentally @xcite .",
    "therefore , we define the kerr interaction using the operators @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 . in this form , and using decompositions into operators of this form , we can then directly apply the measurement - based model introduced in the preceding section , sec .",
    "[ gate_implementation ] .",
    "note that in our previous work @xcite , using our general and systematic decomposition scheme , we substituted @xmath46 and @xmath47 by nested commutators of @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , and we employed correspondingly a universal gate set with only quadratic and cubic gates . here , we do allow for quartic interactions in the elementary gate set , which nonetheless can be incorporated into the optical , ancilla - based implementation scheme .    in order to avoid splitting and commutator approximations , we aim to decompose the kerr interaction using concatenations of the following set of interactions , @xmath52 taking the logarithm of arbitrary concatenations of the two elementary interactions in eq",

    "one possible solution set for eq .",
    "is as follows , @xmath62 these four operators , each diagonal either in @xmath8 or @xmath16 , can be implemented in a measurement - based fashion using suitable ancilla states , as described in sec .",
    "[ gate_implementation ] . before discussing how to possibly realize such ancilla states with quantum optics ,",
    "let us address the question whether teleporting the above four operations onto an arbitrary input state can be done deterministically .      in order to avoid the necessary correction operations",
    "when implementing the non - gaussian cubic and quartic gates in a measurement - based fashion ( recall sec .",
    "[ gate_implementation ] ) , we may simply postselect the measurement result @xmath63 , in which case each of the operators in eq",
    ".   corresponds to one teleportation step .",
    "then we only need four non - gaussian ancillae to decompose the kerr interaction .",
    "following eqs .   and , the actual operators to be teleported onto the input state are given by @xmath64      for a deterministic operation one needs to implement the corrections . in this case",
    ", we choose to realize each cubic and quartic interaction separately , @xmath65 this concatenation is now constructed in order to be able to implement the correction operations for the quartic interactions at the same time together with the subsequent cubic interaction and its corresponding quadratic corrections .",
    "recall that for the quartic operator we need cubic and quadratic corrections , while for the cubic operator we need quadratic corrections .",
    "therefore , in total we need ten elementary teleportation steps .",
    "displacements do not require any teleportation steps , thus we do not count them .",
    "one important subtlety , however , must be mentioned here , when the ancilla - based scheme of sec .",
    "[ gate_implementation ] is to be employed for realizing the ten teleportation steps .",
    "since the correction operations depend on the homodyne measurement outcomes , the corresponding ancilla states can not all be prepared beforehand , i.e. , offline in a strict sense . for every gate that depends on a measurement outcome , the right ancilla state must be prepared effectively online .",
    "a possible remedy for this dilemma is the use of a quantum memory , in which the quantum information to be processed is temporarily stored until the conditional ancilla - state preparation ( e.g. in the form of photonic superposition states , see later ) has succeeded @xcite",
    ".    the scheme without postselection would be certainly most powerful , if even the non - gaussian ancilla states could be prepared in a deterministic fashion whenever they are needed . in this case",
    ", ten deterministic teleportations with ten deterministically prepared ancillae would give a fully deterministic kerr gate .",
    "compared to ten deterministic teleportations with six probabilistically prepared ancilla states ( corresponding to the six operations in eq .   while the extra four quadratic correction operations rely upon unconditional squeezed - state resources ) , the postselected scheme with four probabilistic teleportations and four probabilistically prepared ancillae may well be more efficient ; however , the necessarily finite postselection window would also add extra errors in addition to those caused by imperfect ancilla states .",
    "in our measurement - based kerr - interaction scheme , the ancilla states from eq .",
    "that correspond to the necessary cubic and quartic operators are    [ eq : ancillas ] @xmath66    experimentally realizing the states in eq .",
    "is the most challenging part of our scheme . for this purpose",
    ", we use the taylor expansion approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and extend it from cubic to quartic gates ( interactions ) .",
    "the simplest approximations for cubic and quartic interactions and their corresponding ancilla states are as follows ,    [ eq : approxs ] @xmath67    even though this first - order approximation is very limited , in order to obtain a small - amplitude kerr interaction it is sufficient .",
    "moreover , an approximate cubic interaction like in eq .   has already been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the necessary ancilla states can be created by applying photon substraction and displacement operations upon a squeezed state similar to @xcite .",
    "note that a suitable squeezed vacuum state @xmath68 can be approximated by an eigenstate of the operator @xmath16 with eigenvalue zero , @xmath69 , such that @xmath70 corresponds to @xmath71 after expanding the state , we obtain the conditions for the state , namely @xmath72 for example , for a cubic interaction with the amplitude @xmath73 , the following set is one possible solution , @xmath74    the necessary procedures for the other operators can be derived in a similar fashion .",
    "in this section , we apply the derived decompositions upon some test states and compare the results with those for the same states under an exact kerr evolution .",
    "we first assume to have access to perfect ancillae .",
    "in other words , we assume that we have the elementary operators , such as @xmath75 , available on demand with perfect fidelity .",
    "later we shall relax this condition and assume to have access only to approximate versions of the ancillae , like in eqs .  .",

    "[ fig : yeni_kerr ] .",
    "the exact kerr evolution with amplitude @xmath73 and the decomposed evolution are applied to a coherent state which has an amplitude of @xmath76 . in the position representation , this state is given by @xmath77 in order to be able to calculate the exact evolution , @xmath78 , one can use the well - known fock expansion for the coherent state . note that in fig .",
    "[ fig : yeni_kerr ] , both the real and the imaginary parts of the exact and the decomposed evolutions are overlapping , indicating the high accuracy of the decomposition ( while there are no additional errors , in the measurement - based model corresponding to the use of an ideal ancilla - state set ) .",
