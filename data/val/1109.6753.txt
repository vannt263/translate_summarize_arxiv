    "they have low losses , are easily controllable by microwave pulses and can be fabricated by use of established integrated circuit technology .",
    "recent progress in extending the decoherence time of the qubits has been achieved by identification of the sources of noise and their respective natures .",

    "ref .   for a review .",
    "bistable two level systems ( tls ) existing in the tunneling junction and in the amorphous substrate used to fabricate the qubit , are thought to be the most important source of decoherence in josephson junction qubits , @xcite see also ref .   for a review .",
    "these tlss are assumed to give rise to the observed @xmath0 noise spectra in josephson qubits .",
    "it is known that control and manipulation of josephson qubits by use of microwave pulses unavoidably leads to driving of tlss in the vicinity of the qubit .",
    "while different theories of @xmath0 noise , and their consequences have been studied in great detail , the effect of driving has with one exception been neglected .",
    "recently , the influence of external driving on the noise spectra of such tls was investigated in ref .  .",
    "it was found that the noise at low frequencies was unchanged by driving , while the noise at high frequencies was weakly reduced . in this article",
    "we calculate the noise spectra from a single tls and an ensemble of driven tlss .",
    "the results we obtain differ qualitatively from those obtained in ref .  .",
    "the picture we arrive at is the following : in a general environment , e.g. , a disordered substrate , there will be tlss with a wide distribution of energy splittings @xmath2 and relaxation rates @xmath3 . given a driving field of frequency @xmath4 , we can divide the fluctuators into two groups .",
    "those who are far from resonance and very weakly perturbed by the driving field ( group @xmath5 ) , and those who are close to resonance with the driving field ( group @xmath6 ) . we find that the tlss belonging to group @xmath6 , are strongly affected by the driving provided that the driving amplitude is large compared to the relaxation rate of the tlss .",
    "the response to the driving can roughly be described by two effects .",
    "the first is saturation of the fluctuators .",
    "a two - level fluctuator with large energy splitting compared to temperature , @xmath7 , will in the absence of driving be frozen in the ground state , with a very small probability of switching to the exited state . by driving this fluctuator with a frequency close to resonance , the probability of exitation will increase and by increasing the driving intensity the probability for the fluctuator to be found in the upper state versus the lower state will eventually be similar , thus the tls is saturated .",
    "a driven fluctuator will thus fluctuate ( much ) more rapidly between its upper and lower state .",
    "therefore the noise from this fluctuator will increase .",
    "the second effect caused by driving is a reduction of the noise spectrum , @xmath8 at frequencies centered around @xmath9 and at the same time increased noise at higher frequencies . the driving results in several new peaks in the noise spectrum .",
    "most pronounced are the peaks centered at the renormalized rabi frequency , @xmath10 , at the driving frequency , @xmath4 , and at beatings between these two frequencies .",
    "we find that the net effect of strong driving is a suppressed noise spectrum at low frequencies .",
    "a typical substrate used for fabrication of qubits is often assumed to contain tlss with a @xmath11 distribution of relaxation rates , and a smooth distribution of energy splittings , which can be approximated as uniform .",
    "@xcite this distribution is known to give rise to @xmath0 noise at low frequencies .",
    "@xcite for such an ensemble of fluctuators , the low frequency noise is strongly dominated by the fluctuators with small relaxation rates .",
    "driving at high frequencies resonant with the energy splitting of the qubit , @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( the energy splitting needs to be large compared to temperature , in order to avoid thermal transitions between its eigenstates ) , will result in a significant response only from the fluctuators near resonance with the driving field . in the absence of driving , this subset of fluctuators ( group @xmath6 ) are frozen out and contribute only marginally to the ensemble averaged noise spectra , which is dominated by the fluctuators with small energy splittings , @xmath14",
    ". thus suppression of the low frequency noise from group @xmath6 by strong driving only weakly influences the full ensemble - produced noise spectra at low frequencies , but strongly increases the noise at higher frequencies .",
    "however , our results show that while external driving at qubit frequency for typical ensembles of fluctuators will not have significant impact on the low frequency noise , external low frequency driving might significantly suppress it . driving at low frequencies will effect the fluctuators that contribute most strongly to the dephasing - producing noise felt by the qubit ( i.e. , those with small energy splitting , @xmath2 ) .",
    "these tlss are only weakly influenced by the saturation effect since their ratio @xmath15 is low and correspondingly the population level in the upper state is already high in the absence of driving . therefore , the net effect of driving on the low @xmath2 fluctuators is almost entirely a shift in the frequency spectra from low to high frequencies . to us",
    "this seems like a promising method to reduce pure dephasing noise and thereby increase @xmath1 for the qubit .",
    "it is , however , important to note that the high frequency noise will be increased , specifically around the rabi frequency of the driven fluctuators as well as around the driving frequency .",
    "one should therefore make sure that these frequencies lie sufficiently far from the eigenfrequency of the qubit in order to avoid decreasing @xmath16 . in this article",
    "we will focus on the low frequency noise , the noise at frequencies close to the qubit splitting need to be treated separately , see refs . .",
    "the rest of this article is divided in the following sections . in section [ model ] we will describe our model of a tls in an external field and the assumptions behind it . thereafter in section [ single ] we will derive an expression for the noise spectrum from a single tls and look at different limiting cases . in section [ many ] we will derive an expression for the ensemble averaged noise in the case of strong driving , for a particular distribution of tls parameters @xmath17 . in section [ sec : qubit ]",
    "we will discuss the effect of the driven tlss on the central qubit .",
    "finally the results will be discussed in section [ discussion ] .",
    "in this section we will study the dynamics of tlss ( fluctuators ) subject to an external ac electric field , @xmath18 , and a thermal environment .",
    "the nature of the two level systems we are interested in can , e.g. , be considered to be bistable fluctuators tunneling between distinct charge configurations , leading to charge noise in the qubit .",
    "these charge fluctuators might be attributed to tunneling of charges between either localized impurity states , between localized impurity states and metallic electrodes , or between different charge configurations in a dielectric material .",
    "@xcite we model the charge configurations associated with each state of a given tls by its effective dipole moment @xmath19 . in order to capture the action of the environment ( e.g. , thermal phonons ) responsible for relaxation and decoherence of the tls",
    ", we apply the bloch - redfield approach .",
    "@xcite we assume that the interaction between different tlss is weak compared to the coupling to the thermal bath , such that eventual correlations between the tlss are neglected .",
    "furthermore we assume that the tlss couple sufficiently weakly to the qubit compared to other degrees of freedom in the environment that neglection of the qubit is justified when studying the dynamics of the tls .",
    "this allows us to use a perturbative approach when treating the effect of the tls(s ) on the qubit .",
    "our hamiltonian for the tlss closely follows that of ref .  .",
    "a fluctuator , e.g. , a particle in a double well potential with associated dipole moment @xmath19 , can be modeled as a two level system with tunneling matrix element @xmath20 and asymmetry energy @xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian of this tls in an applied electric field , @xmath18 is then @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 . here",

    "the matrices @xmath33 and @xmath34 are pauli matrices acting in the eigenbasis of the qubit and the tls , respectively and @xmath35 is the qubit - fluctuator coupling parameter . the tls - qubit coupling will be neglected when treating the dynamics of the tls , assuming it is weak compared to other terms .",
    "but it is , of course , important with regards to the decoherence of the qubit .",
    "we note that the situation when the qubit and the tls have very close splittings is an exception .",
    "then the interaction is strong .",
    "see , e.g. , refs .  .    rather than specifying the explicit nature of the coupling to the environment , @xmath36 , we make use of the bloch - redfield equation , where the environment enter as damping terms , seeking to relax the density matrix towards its thermal equilibrium value .",
