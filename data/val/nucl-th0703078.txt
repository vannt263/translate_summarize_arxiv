    "statistical model and hydro - inspired model calculations indicate the picture of early chemical freeze - out(cfo ) for strange hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions@xcite .",
    "the cfo temperature can be extracted by fitting the model calculation of particle ratios for hadrons to the experimental data . on the other hand ,",
    "one obtains the thermal freeze - out temperature from the slope of transverse momentum distributions by assuming some radial flow profile .",
    "naturally , it is therefore motivating to see how this scenario can be adopted by more realistic models , where a full three - dimensional hydrodynamical evolution is taken into account . in this work ,",
    "we present results of hydrodynamical model calculations , inspired by this picture .",
    "the hydrodynamical model we employed is based on smoothed particle hydrodynamic(sph ) algorithm@xcite , in this model , the matter flow is parametrized in terms of discrete lagrangian coordinates , of the so - called sph particles . as a result",
    ", the hydrodynamic equations are reduced to a system of coupled ordinary differential equations .",
    "the code which implements the entropy representation of the sph model for relativistic high energy collisions , and which has been developed within the so paulo - rio de janeiro collaboration , is called spherio .",
    "as it has been shown , the model is an efficient and robust method to tackle the problems concerning relativistic high - energy nucleus - nucleus collisions , which are characterized by highly asymmetrical configurations .",
    "it has been successfully used to investigate the effects of the initial - condition fluctuations and adopting the continuous emission scenario for the description of decoupling process @xcite .    in the present calculation ,",
    "the model has been further improved in order to consider strangeness conservation and to adopt the scenario of cfo . the strangeness conservation is implemented by explicitly incorporating strangeness chemical potential into the code , and correspondingly a different set of equation of state(eos ) has been built and utilized . as a good approximation , we assume local strangeness neutrality throughout the hydro evolution .    to adopt the picture of cfo , as a first step , we take a simple postulate that for strange hadrons such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the cfo takes place immediately after they are completely hadronized .",
    "these particles cease to have inelastic collisions and therefore their abundances are fixed and determined only by partonic eos . instead of introducing a specific temperature ,",
    "cfo is incorporated in a simple and parameter - free approach .",
    "this is inspired by the earlier estimation from statistical model@xcite that cfo takes place close to the phase transition region .",
    "it is also because at this point , we would like first to check whether the picture of cfo would qualitatively improve the result of hydrodynamic model without going into the details of parameters .",
    "with the system being cooled and rarefied further , the thermal freeze - out occurs at a lower temperature @xmath4 which serves as an adjustable parameter in our calculation .",
    "as in the previous calculations , we use nexus event generator to produce event - by - event fluctuating initial conditions . we make use of a rescaling factor@xcite to fix the pseudo - rapidity distribution for all charged particles . in the present calculation , we introduce another parameter @xmath5 which provides initial transverse velocity in addition to the one provided by nexus .",
    "the reason for the introduction of @xmath5 is because nexus almost does not provide any initial transverse velocity .",
    "thus the initial transverse expansion reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radial distance from orgin .      as a preliminary application",
    ", we have calculated the pseudo - rapidity distribution for all charged particles . in fig.1 , we present the pseudo - rapidity distribution for the most central au+au collisions at 200a gev .",
    "the experimental data are from phobos collab , taken in the most central au+au at 200a gev .",
    "we show in fig.2 , the experimental transverse momentum distribution data for all charged particles , which can be well reproduced with a choice of @xmath8@xmath9 and freeze - out temperature @xmath10 mev .",
    "the experimental data are from star collab@xcite , taken in the most central au+au at 200a gev , with @xmath11 .        with the parameters chosen , in the following , we calculate the spectra for various hadrons . in fig.3",
    "we show the transverse mass spectra of pions , protons and kaons for most central collisions at mid rapidity , as well as experimental data from brahms collab@xcite .",
    "the same spectra for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are depicted in fig.4 , together with data from star collab@xcite .",
    "we use dotted lines to represent the results obtained without incorporating cfo , and solid lines for those with cfo switched on .",
    "it is observed that the present hydrodynamic model gives good description of the experimental transverse momentum spectra for pions , kaons and protons even without turning on cfo for these particles .",
    "although it gives the correct slopes for the spectra of strange hyperons such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the disagreement comes from the multiplicities of the spectra . by introducing cfo ,",
    "those results are improved significantly . while the spectra for pions , kaons and protons almost remain the same , ( this is not shown in the figures . )",
    "it provides a good fit of strange hyperons @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the cfo amplifies the multiplicities of strange hadrons with respect to the ones in the original model owing to higher cfo temperature , as compared with the thermal freeze out one .",
    "meanwhile the slopes of the spectra remain unchanged .",
    "it was indicated experimentally in ref.@xcite , as one goes to large rapidity region where the baryon density differs sizably from zero , the outcome of cfo would be much more significant .",
    "further work on this topic is under progress .",
    "it is worth noting that the effect of cfo has been discussed by several authors . in ref@xcite , the early cfo",
    "is studied in term of hybrid model where the hydodynamic evolution is complemented with a hadronic cascade model .",
    "the pure hydrodynamic evolution calculation has been carried out either only in the transverse plane assuming bjorken s scaling@xcite or with the baryon chemical potential taken to be zero@xcite .",
