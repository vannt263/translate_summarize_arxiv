    "x - ray observations with @xmath0 ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) have led to the discoveries of low luminosity active galactic nuclei ( llagns ) , with the 210 kev luminosity in the range 10@xmath6 erg s@xmath4 , in a fair number of nearby spiral galaxies ( makishima et al . 1994 ; iyomoto et al . 1996 ; ishisaki et al . 1996 ; iyomoto et al .",
    "1997 ) . on the contrary , case of similar llagns has been scarce in elliptical or s0 galaxies .",
    "this is presumably due to selection effects , since there are supporting evidences of llagns in early - type galaxies .",
    "for one thing , several agns with luminosity in the range 10@xmath7erg s@xmath4 are known to reside in elliptical galaxies such as cen  a ( e.g. sugizaki et al . 1997 ) , ngc  3998 ( awaki et al . 1991 ) and m  87 ( e.g. schreier et al . 1982 ) .",
    "what is more , radio and optical kinematics have revealed super - massive black holes in the nuclei of several nearby galaxies , both spirals ( e.g. ngc  4258 ; miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) and ellipticals ( e.g. ngc  3377 and ngc  3115 ; kormendy et al .",
    "finally , ho et al . ( 1997a ) reported that @xmath145 % of s0 and elliptical galaxies have low ionization nuclear emission region ( liner ) .",
    "since most liner nuclei observed with asca have turned out to be llagns , it is expected that there are many llagns in early - type galaxies .    in view of the relation between normal galaxies and agns ,",
    "it is particularly important to search for llagns in early - type galaxies , because many luminous agns such as quasars ( bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ; hooper et al .",
    "1997 ) , bl lac objects , and radio galaxies are found in early - type galaxies .",
    "we here report on the @xmath0 observations of llagn candidates in s0 galaxies , ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 .",
    "ngc  3065 is an s0 galaxy at a distance of 31.3 mpc ( tully et al .",
    "1988 , in which @xmath8 = 75 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 is used ) .",
    "no activity has been reported , except for a moderately large luminousity in far - infrared ( 1.6 jy at 60 @xmath9 m and 1.8 jy at 100 @xmath9 m ; knapp et al . 1989 ) . in soft x - rays ,",
    "ngc  3065 was detected with the _ einstein observatory _ ; although the spectrum was not well determined , the 0.24 kev luminosity was estimated to be 9.3@xmath210@xmath5 erg s@xmath4 at 31.3 mpc ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1992 ) , assuming a `` raymond - smith '' thermal spectrum with temperature @xmath10=1 kev .",
    "ngc  4203 is an s0 galaxy at 9.7 mpc ( tully et al .",
    "1988 , again with @xmath8=75 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) .",
    "it is also a far infrared source both at 60 @xmath9 m ( 0.6 jy ) and 100 @xmath9 m ( 1.9 jy ; knapp et al .",
    "kim et al . ( 1992 ) , using the _ einstein observatory _ , reported that ngc  4203 has a hard spectrum modeled with a bremsstrahlung having a temperature higher than 5 kev , whose 0.24 kev luminosity reaches 3.5@xmath210@xmath5 erg s@xmath4 ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1992 ) . using @xmath11 , bregman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) detected ngc  4203 as a point - like source coincident with the nucleus , and concluded that ngc  4203 hosts a modest agn .",
    "it also shows weak activities in other wavebands , such as a weak central source at 6 cm ( fabbiano et al .",
    "1989 ) and a liner nucleus with a broad h@xmath12 line ( ho et al . 1997b ) .",
    "ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 were observed with @xmath0 on 1995 october 22 for 76 ks and 1993 decenber 17 for 37 ks , respectively . in both observations , the gis ( gas imaging spectrometer ; ohashi et al .",
    "1996 , makishima et al .",
    "1996 ) was operated in ph normal mode , and the sis ( solid - state imaging spectrometer ; bruke et al .",
    "1991 ) was operated in 2-ccd mode .",
    "both targets were clearly detected with @xmath0 .",
    "we corrected the sis data of ngc  3065 for residual dark distribution ( rdd ) using the frame - mode data obtained on 1995 november 20 and 21 .",
    "the mean counting rates of ngc  3065 were 0.06 and 0.08 c s@xmath4 with the gis and sis , respectively .",
    "those of ngc  4203 were 0.02 c s@xmath4 with the gis , and 0.04 c s@xmath4 with the sis .",
    "we selected the data which satisfied the following criteria .",
    "first , the geomagnetic cut - off rigidity should be larger than 7 gev c@xmath4 for the gis data and 6 gev c@xmath4 for the sis data .",
    "second , the source elevation angle above earth s limb during periods of dark earth should be larger than 5@xmath13 for the gis and 10@xmath13 for the sis .",
    "third , for sis only , the source elevation angle should be larger than 25@xmath13 for sunlit earth .      in figure 1",
    ", we show contour maps of the sis images of ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 . in the ngc",
    "3065 image , the peak of x - ray emission coincides in position with the optical nucleus ( 10@xmath1401@xmath1553@xmath16 , @xmath1772@xmath1310@xmath1813@xmath19 ) within 0@xmath18.3 , which is within the typical astrometric accuracy of @xmath0 ( @xmath20 ) . in the ngc",
    "4203 image , we see two point - like sources , in agreement with the @xmath11 image obtained in 1991 ( bregman et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the north and south brightness centroids coincide in position with the optical nucleus of ngc  4203 ( 12@xmath1415@xmath1521@xmath16 , @xmath1733@xmath1310@xmath1822@xmath19 ) within 0@xmath18.2 and with a blue object ton  1480 ( or cso  400 ) at ( 12@xmath1415@xmath1509@xmath16 , @xmath1733@xmath1309@xmath1856@xmath19 ; pesch & sanduleak 1988 ) within 0@xmath18.3 , respectively .",
    "let us next examine the angular extent of the x - ray emission .",
    "we projected the ngc  3065 image onto y axis of the sis  0 detector , while the ngc  4203 image onto a dashed line in figure 1b .",
    "we compared the projected sis  0 brightness profiles with those of point spread function ( psf ) in 0.67.0 kev convolved through gaussian profiles of various widths . in analyzing the ngc  4203 nucleus or the south source",
    ", we fixed the gaussian width of the other to 0@xmath18.0 .",
    "all these sources were confirmed to be point - like , because their profiles were fitted successfully with gaussians of zero width ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the 90% confidence upper limits on the source angular extent of ngc  3065 , the ngc  4203 nucleus , and the south source are 0@xmath18.1 ( or 0.9 kpc at a distance of 31.3 mpc ) , 0@xmath18.2 ( or 0.6 kpc at a distance of 9.7 mpc ) , and 0@xmath18.2 , respectively .",
    "we made the gis and sis spectra of ngc  3065 , integrating the photons around the nucleus with radius of 4@xmath18 and of 3@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "we made background spectra using the blank sky data at the same positions on the detector plane as the on - source spectra , and subtracted them from the on - source spectra .",
    "the background count rate was @xmath113% of the total count rate .",
    "we then fitted the gis ( gis  2+gis  3 ) and the sis ( sis  0+sis  1 ) spectra separately , with an absorbed power - law model .",
    "the photon index , absorption , and flux estimated from the two instruments are consistent with each other within 90 % error regions .",
    "accordingly , we next fitted the gis and sis spectra jointly to find that the data were well described by a photon index of 1.8 .",
    "we summarize the fit parameters in table 1 , and present the x - ray spectra of ngc  3065 in figure 3a together with the best - fit power - law model obtained from the joint fit . at a distance of 31.3 mpc , the 210 kev luminosity becomes ( 2.2@xmath210.1)@xmath210@xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "alternatively , a bremsstrahlung model of temperature @xmath16 kev , together with the galactic absorption , also well accounted for the gis , sis , and the gis+sis spectra of ngc  3065 .    in order to study the fe - k emission line feature",
    ", we added a narrow gaussian component , having a fixed center energy at 6.4 kev or 6.7 kev , to the power law model .",
    "the 90% upper limit of the equivalent width of the 6.4 kev ( neutral ) line turned out to be 0.2 kev , and that of 6.7 kev ( helium - like ) line was 0.3 kev .",
    "since the separation between the ngc  4203 nucleus and the south source is only 2@xmath18 , we accumulated the gis and sis events around each of these sources using a small integration radius of 1@xmath18 .",
    "since half power diameter of the @xmath0 xrt is @xmath22 , some signal mixing occurs between the two integration regions .",
    "we consider this effect later .",
    "the ratio of the background count to the total count of the nuclear region was @xmath14 % , and that of the south - source region was @xmath15 % .",
    "figure 3b shows x - ray spectra obtained from the nuclear region .",
    "these spectra are well described by either a power - law model of photon index @xmath231.8 , or a bremsstrahlung model of temperature @xmath246 kev .",
    "the spectral parameters estimated separately with the two instruments are consistent with each other within 90 % error regions .",
    "accordingly , we jointly fitted the gis and sis spectra keeping all parameters common , except the model normalization in order to cope with the difference in spatial resolution between the two instruments .",
    "the best - fit power - law model obtained from the joint fit is overlaid on the spectra of figure 3b , and its parameters are summarized in table 1 . the fe - k line was not statistically significant : in the same manner as ngc  3065 , the upper limits on the fe - k equivalent width for neutral and helium - like line were estimated to be 0.2 kev and 0.3 kev , respectively .",
    "the spectrum obtained from the south - source region also shows featureless spectra ( figure 3c ) .",
    "either a power - law model or a bremsstrahlung model well accounts for the gis and sis spectra .",
    "the best - fit power - law model determined jointly with the gis and sis is overlaid on figure 3c , and the derived spectral parameters are presented in table 1 .",
    "we now correct the above results for the signal mixing between the two integration regions .",
    "fortunately , the spectral shape parameters derived from these two regions are very similar to each other , as can be seen in table 1 . therefore the spectral shapes of the two sources are not affected by the signal mixing , and we only need to make corrections to their fluxes . utilizing the point spread functions ( psfs ) of the xrt+gis and the xrt+sis",
    ", we estimate that @xmath125 % and @xmath120 % of the photons detected with the gis and sis in the nucleus region are coming from the south source , respectively .",
    "conversely , @xmath135 % ( gis ) and @xmath130 % ( sis ) of the photons detected in the south - source region are in reality from the nucleus . by sorting out these effects ,",
    "we have calculated the intrinsic fluxes of the two sources as shown in table 1 .",
    "these values are weighted means of the two instruments , since they gave consistent results .",
    "thus , the 210 kev luminosity of the nuclear source becomes @xmath25 erg s@xmath4 at a distance of 9.7 mpc .",
    "these two sources were studied previously with @xmath11 ( bregman et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the absorptions estimated with @xmath11 of 2.5@xmath210@xmath26@xmath27 ( nucleus ) and 3.4@xmath210@xmath26@xmath27 ( south source ) are within 90 % error regions of those with @xmath0 , while the photon indices of 2.24 ( nucleus ) and 2.84 ( south source ) are somewhat softer than the @xmath0 results , although bregman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) did not mention errors associated with the photon indices .",
    "we made 0.78 kev gis light curves of the three sources detected in the two fields ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the photon integration regions are 3@xmath18 around ngc  3065 and 1@xmath18 around the two sources in ngc  4203 .",
    "the ratio of the background to the signal is @xmath110 % ( ngc  3065 ) or @xmath15 % ( the ngc  4203 nucleus and the south source ) .",
    "we did not use the sis data , since the sources are placed near ( 1@xmath18 ) to the dead region between two chips in the sis detectors and hence the sis count rates were subject to the spacecraft attitude jittering , although it has a minor effects on the spectral analysis .",
    "as the figure indicates , no significant short - term variability was detected above an upper limit of 50 % ( peak - to - peak ) during each observation .",
    "if we fit the data assuming a constant count rate , @xmath28/d.o.f . of the gis light curves become 70/75 ( ngc  3065 ) , 68/63 ( the ngc  4203 nucleus ) , and 62/63 ( the south source ) .    in order to investigate long - term variability , we extrapolated the power - law models of the @xmath0 spectra toward lower energies , considering errors of photon index and intrinsic absorption , and compared the calculated fluxes with those obtained with the _ einstein observatory _ and @xmath11 .",
    "as shown in table 2 , the 0.24.0 kev flux of ngc  3065 predicted by @xmath0 is thus twice higher than that measured with the _ einstein observatory _ in 1980 .",
    "however this difference is likely to be a result of the inadequate modeling of the _ einstein _ flux ; it was estimated assuming 1 kev thin thermal emission , which is much softer than those measured with @xmath0 and give rise to an underestimation of the flux by a factor @xmath11.8 . besides , the _ einstein _",
    "flux of ngc  3065 has a large error because the exposure time was short ( 0.9 ks ) and total counts were very small ( 25.2 ) .",
    "the ngc  4203 nucleus and the south source were not resolved with _ einstein _ due to a short exposure time ( 1.5 ks ) .",
    "therefore , we compared the summed flux of these sources predicted by @xmath0 to the flux of whole galaxy measured with _",
    "the latter was obtained assuming an adequate model , namely , a raymond - smith model with @xmath10 greater than 5 kev and solar abundance .",
    "considering relatively small total counts ( 189.97 ) with the _ einstein observatory _ , the fluxes measured with @xmath0 and the _ einstein observatory _ agree with each other within model uncertainties .",
    "the fluxes of the ngc  4203 nucleus and the south source observed with @xmath11 and @xmath0 are also consistent with each other within model uncertainties . in short",
    ", there is no clear evidence of long - term variability in any of the three sources .",
    "the spectra of ngc  3065 and the ngc  4203 nucleus have been well modeled with a power - law having a seyfert - like photon index of 1.8 . besides , both sources are pointlike within the limitation of the instrumental psf , and their positions are consistent with those of the optical nuclei .",
    "therefore these x - ray sources are likely to be faint active nuclei .",
    "we can not however rule out another possibility that these sources are attributed to unresolved integrated emission from a bunch of low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) which underlies the x - ray spectra of all galaxies ( canizares et al . 1987 ; matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ) . actually , a bremsstrahlung model , which is an approximation to the x - ray spectra from lmxbs ( makishima et al . 1989 ) , describes the spectra of these two objects as adequately as the power - law model .",
    "the constraints on the angular extent is relatively loose .",
    "moreover we detected no time variability .    to distinguish between the llagn and lmxb emissions",
    ", we may utilize the fact that the luminosity ot the latter component is well correlated with the optical luminosity of the host galaxy ( canizares et al .",
    "1987 ; matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "in figure 5 we plotted the 210 kev luminosity @xmath29 of the two sources at the nuclei against the blue band luminosity @xmath30 of the host galaxies in comparison with those of normal early - type galaxies ( matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ) and llagns in spiral galaxies .",
    "spectra of the latter two groups usually consist of two components ; a thin - thermal emission from inter - staller matter and a harder emission from lmxb and/or agn .",
    "therefore we used 210 kev luminosities of the hard component @xmath31 only in the comparison , utilizing spectral studies with asca .",
    "thus , the @xmath29/@xmath30 ratios of ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 are two orders of magnitude higher than those of normal galaxies , and even exceed those of spiral - hosted llagns .",
    "we may , therefore , reasonably attribute these x - ray sources to the llagn emission , wherein the lmxb contribution is negligible .",
    "we thus conclude that the two s0 galaxies , ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 , both host llagns . this conclusion on ngc  4203 confirms the previous suggestion by bregman et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , where that on ngc  3065 is an unexpected new finding .",
    "these results encourages us to speculate that llagns are abundant not only in late - type galaxies but also in early - type ones .",
    "the x - ray spectra of these llagns require small or no intrinsic absorption ; consequently , they are type i objects .",
    "the insignificance of fluorescent fe - k lines are also consistent with the results of the seyfert i s ( nandra et al .",
    "the photon index of 1.8 also suggests that the nuclear emission is seen directly , because if the reprocessed emission were dominant , the spectrum would become harder than observed .",
    "ngc  1097 ( iyomoto et al . 1996 ) and m  81 ( ishisaki et al . 1996 ) are similar examples of type i llagns in late - type galaxies .",
    "the nuclei of ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 show no significant short - term x - ray variability .",
    "similar tendency is reported in several late - type llagns , and interpreted as a possible evidence of larger black hole mass .",
    "thus , the x - ray properties of these two llagns in s0 galaxies are not different from those in late - type galaxies , except that their @xmath29/@xmath30 ratios are somewhat higher .",
    "ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 are moderately luminous in far infrared , and ratios of the 0.54.0 kev flux to 60 @xmath9 m flux become 5.5@xmath210@xmath32 and 1.4@xmath210@xmath32 , respectively .",
    "these lie on the x - ray to 60 @xmath9 m correlation among active galaxies reported in green et al .",
    "( 1992 ) .",
    "the south source coincides in position with a blue object ton  1480 ( or cso  400 ) at an apparent blue magnitude of 17 ( pesch & sanduleak 1988 ) .",
    "it is also detected at 4.85 ghz with a flux of 36@xmath217 mjy ( becker et al .",
    "1991 ; gregory & condon 1991 ) .",
    "these properties , together with the point - like image , hard spectrum , and a 210 kev flux of ( 1.0@xmath33)@xmath34 erg s@xmath4 @xmath27 obtained with @xmath0 , are consistent with an interpretation that it is a background agn .    finally , we searched for thin - thermal emission from the two galaxies , by adding a raymond - smith model with fixed temperature ( 1 kev ) and abundance ( 0.5 solar ) to the power - law model .",
    "we obtained upper limits only ; 6.4@xmath35 erg s@xmath4 and 1.4@xmath36 erg s@xmath4 in 0.54 kev for ngc  3065 and ngc  4203 , respectively .",
    "these upper limits are reasonable for plasma emissions from inter - stellar matter in s0 galaxies ( matsushita et al .",
    "1994 ) , implying that the thermal emission is completely masked by the strong agn emission .",
