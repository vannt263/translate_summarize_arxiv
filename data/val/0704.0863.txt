    "a long - standing problem in the study of elliptical galaxies is the far - ultraviolet ( uv ) excess in their spectra .",
    "traditionally , elliptical galaxies were supposed to be passively evolving and not contain any young stars that radiate in the far - uv .",
    "therefore , the discovery of an excess of radiation in the far - uv by the _ orbiting astronomical observatory _ mission 2 ( oao-2 ) @xcite came as a complete surprise . indeed , this was one of the first major discoveries in uv astronomy and became a basic property of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this far - uv excess is often referred to as the `` uv - upturn '' , since the flux increases in the spectral energy distributions of elliptical galaxies as the wavelength decreases from 2000 to 1200 .",
    "the uv - upturn is also known as uv rising - branch , uv rising flux , or simply uvx ( see the review by oconnell 1999 ) .",
    "the uv - upturn phenomenon exists in virtually all elliptical galaxies and is the most variable photometric feature .",
    "a famous correlation between uv - upturn magnitude and metallicity was found by burstein et  al .   from _ international ultraviolet explorer satellite _",
    "( iue ) spectra of 24 quiescent early - type galaxies ( hereafter bbbfl relation ) .",
    "the uv - upturn could be important in many respects : for the formation history and evolutionary properties of stars , the chemical enrichment of galaxies , galaxy dynamics , constraints to the stellar age and metallicity of galaxies and realistic `` k - corrections '' @xcite .",
    "in particular , the uv - upturn has been proposed as a possible age indicator for giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "the origin of the uv - upturn , however , has remained one of the great mysteries of extragalactic astrophysics for some 30 years @xcite , and numerous speculations have been put forward to explain it : non - thermal radiation from an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) , young massive stars , the central stars of planetary nebulae ( pne ) or post - asymptotic giant branch ( pagb ) stars , horizontal branch ( hb ) stars and post - hb stars ( including post - early agb stars and agb - manqu stars ) and accreting white dwarfs @xcite . using observations made with the the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) and comparing them to synthetic spectra , ferguson et  al .   and subsequent studies by brown , ferguson & davidsen , brown et  al .  , and",
    "dorman , oconnell & rood were able to show that the uv upturn is mainly caused by extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) stars .",
    "brown et  al .",
    "detected ehb stars for the first time in an elliptical galaxy ( the core of m  32 ) and therefore provided direct evidence for the ehb origin of the uv - upturn .",
    "ehb stars , also known as subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars , are core - helium - burning stars with extremely thin hydrogen envelopes ( @xmath2 ) , and most of them are believed to have masses around @xmath3 @xcite , as has recently been confirmed asteroseismologically in the case of pg 0014 + 067 @xcite .",
    "they have a typical luminosity of a few @xmath4 , a lifetime of @xmath5 , and a characteristic surface temperature of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the origin of those hot , blue stars , as the major source of the far uv radiation , has remained an enigma in evolutionary population synthesis ( eps ) studies of elliptical galaxies .",
    "two models , both involving single - star evolution , have previously been proposed to explain the uv - upturn : a metal - poor model @xcite and a metal - rich model @xcite .",
    "the metal - poor model ascribes the uv - upturn to an old metal - poor population of hot subdwarfs , blue core - helium - burning stars , that originate from the low - metallicity tail of a stellar population with a wide metallicity distribution @xcite .",
    "this model explains the bbbfl relation since elliptical galaxies with high average metallicity tend to be older and therefore have stronger uv - upturns .",
    "the model tends to require a very large age of the population ( larger than the generally accepted age of the universe ) , and it is not clear whether the metal - poor population is sufficiently blue or not .",
    "moreover , the required low - metallicity appears inconsistent with the large metallicity inferred for the majority of stars in elliptical galaxies @xcite .    in the metal - rich model",
    "the uv - upturn is caused by metal - rich stars that lose their envelopes near the tip of the first - giant branch ( fgb ) .",
    "this model @xcite assumes a relatively high metallicity  consistent with the metallicity of typical elliptical galaxies ( @xmath7 times the solar metallicity ) . in the model ,",
    "the mass - loss rate on the red - giant branch , usually scaled with the reimer s rate @xcite , is assumed to be enhanced , where the coefficient @xmath8 in the reimer s rate is taken to be @xmath9 times the canonical value . in order to reproduce the hb morphology of galactic globular clusters , either a broad distribution of @xmath8 is postulated @xcite , or , alternatively , a gaussian mass - loss distribution is applied that is designed to reproduce the distribution of horizontal - branch stars of a given age and metallicity @xcite .",
    "this model also needs a population age that is generally larger than 10gyr . to explain the bbbfl uv - upturn  metallicity relation , the reimer s coefficient @xmath8 is assumed to increase with metallicity , and the enrichment parameter for the helium abundance associated with the increase in metallicity , @xmath10 , needs to be @xmath11 .",
    "both of these models are quite _ ad hoc _ : there is neither observational evidence for a very old , low - metallicity sub - population in elliptical galaxies , nor is there a physical explanation for the very high mass loss required for just a small subset of stars .",
    "furthermore , the onset of the formation of the hot subdwarfs is very sudden as the stellar population evolves , and both models require a large age for the production of the hot stars . as a consequence ,",
    "the models predict that the uv upturn of elliptical galaxies declines rapidly with redshift .",
    "however , this does not appear to be consistent with recent observations with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) @xcite .",
    "the recent survey with the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) satellite @xcite showed that the intrinsic uv - upturn seems not to decrease in strength with redshift .",
    "the bbbfl relation shows that the @xmath0 colour becomes bluer with metallicity ( or lick spectral index mg@xmath12 ) , where @xmath0 is the far - uv magnitude relative to the @xmath13 magnitude .",
    "the relation could support the metal - rich model .",
    "however , the correlation is far from being conclusively established .",
    "ohl et  al .",
    "studied the far - uv colour gradients in 8 early - type galaxies and found no correlation between the fuv-_b _ colour gradients and the internal metallicity gradients based on the mg@xmath12 spectral line index , a result not expected from the bbbfl relation .",
    "deharveng , boselli & donas studied the far - uv radiation of 82 early - type galaxies , a uv - flux selected sample , and compared them to the bbbfl sample , investigating individual objects with a substantial record in the refereed literature spectroscopically .",
    "they found no correlation between the @xmath1 colour and the mg@xmath12 spectral index .",
    "rich et  al .   also found no correlation in a sample of 172 red quiescent early - type galaxies observed by galex and the _ sloan digital sky survey _",
    "( sdss ) . indeed ,",
    "if there is a weak correlation in the data , the correlation is in the opposite sense to that of bbbfl : metal - rich galaxies have redder @xmath14 ( far - uv magnitude minus red magnitude ) . on the other hand , boselli et  al .",
    ", using new galex data , reported a mild positive correlation between @xmath15 , which is the far - uv magnitude relative to the near - uv , and metallicity in a sample of early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "donas et  al .",
    "use galex photometry to construct colour - colour relationships for nearby early - type galaxies sorted by morphological type .",
    "they also found a marginal positive correlation between @xmath15 and metallicity .",
    "these correlations , however , do not necessarily support the bbbfl relation , as neither boselli et  al .   nor donas et  al .",
    "show that @xmath14 correlates significantly with metallicity .",
    "therefore , this apparent lack of an observed correlation between the strength of the uv - upturn and metallicity casts some doubt on the metal - rich scenario .",
    "both models ignore the effects of binary evolution . on the other hand , hot subdwarfs",
    "have long been studied in our own galaxy @xcite , and it is now well established that the vast majority of ( and quite possibly all ) galactic hot subdwarfs are the results of binary interactions .",
    "observationally , more than half of galactic hot subdwarfs are found in binaries @xcite , and orbital parameters have been determined for a significant sample @xcite .",
    "there has also been substantial theoretical progress @xcite .",
    "recently , han et  al .",
    "proposed a binary model ( hereafter hpmm model ) for the formation of hot subdwarfs in binaries and single hot subdwarfs . in the model , there are three formation channels for hot subdwarfs , involving common - envelope @xcite ejection for hot subdwarf binaries with short orbital periods , stable roche lobe overflow for hot subdwarfs with long orbital periods , and the merger of helium white dwarfs to form single hot subdwarfs .",
    "the model can explain the main observational characteristics of hot subdwarfs , in particular , their distributions in the orbital period ",
    "minimum companion mass diagram and in the effective temperature  surface gravity diagram , their distributions of orbital period and mass function , their binary fraction and the fraction of hot subdwarf binaries with white dwarf ( wd ) companions , their birth rates and their space density .",
    "more recent observations ( e.g.  lisker et  al .  2004 , 2005 ) support the hpmm model , and the model is now widely used in the study of hot subdwarfs ( e.g.  heber et  al .",
    "2004 , morales - rueda , maxted & marsh 2004 , charpinet et  al .",
    "2005 , morales - rueda et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "hot subdwarfs radiate in uv , and we can apply the hpmm scenario without any further assumptions to the uv - upturn problem of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the only assumption we have to make is that the stellar population in elliptical galaxies , specifically their binary properties , are similar to those in our own galaxy . indeed , as we will show in this paper , the uv flux from hot subdwarfs produced in binaries is important .",
    "this implies that any model for elliptical galaxies that does not include these binary channels is _ necessarily _ incomplete or has to rely on the _ apriori _ implausible assumption that the binary population in elliptical galaxies is intrinsically different .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to develop an _ apriori _ eps model for the uv - upturn of elliptical galaxies , by employing the hpmm scenario for the formation of hot subdwarfs , and to compare the model results with observations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the eps model in section 2 and the simulations in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we present the results and discuss them , and end the paper with a summary and conclusions in section 5 .",
    "eps is a technique for modelling the spectrophotometric properties of a stellar population using our knowledge of stellar evolution .",
    "the technique was first devised by tinsley @xcite and has experienced rapid development ever since @xcite .",
    "recently , binary interactions have also been incorporated into eps studies @xcite with the rapid binary - evolution code developed by hurley , tout & pols . in the present paper",
    "we incorporate the hpmm model into eps by adopting the binary population synthesis ( bps ) code of han et  al .  , which was designed to investigate the formation of many interesting binary - related objects , including hot subdwarfs .",
    "the bps code of han et  al .  was originally developed in 1994 and has been updated regularly ever since @xcite . with the code ,",
    "millions of stars ( including binaries ) can be evolved simultaneously from the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) to the white - dwarf ( wd ) stage or a supernova explosion .",
    "the code can simulate in a monte - carlo way the formation of many types of stellar objects , such as type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) , double degenerates ( dds ) , cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , barium stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) and hot subdwarfs . note that `` hot subdwarfs '' in this paper",
    "is used as a collective term for subdwarf b stars , subdwarf o stars , and subdwarf ob stars .",
    "they are core - helium - burning stars with thin hydrogen envelopes and radiate mainly in the uv ( see figure  [ chart ] for the formation channels of hot subdwarfs ) .",
    "the main input into the bps code is a grid of stellar models . for the purpose of this paper ,",
    "we use a population i ( pop i ) grid with a typical metallicity @xmath16 .",
    "the grid , calculated with eggleton s stellar evolution code @xcite , covers the evolution of normal stars in the range of @xmath17 with hydrogen abundance @xmath18 and helium abundance @xmath19 , helium stars in the range of @xmath20 and hot subdwarfs in the range of @xmath21 ( see han et  al .",
    "2002 , 2003 for details ) .",
    "single stars are evolved via interpolations in the model grid . in this paper",
    ", we use @xmath22 instead of @xmath23 as the interpolation variable between stellar evolution tracks , where @xmath22 is the time from the zams to the tip of the fgb for a given stellar mass @xmath24 and is calculated from fitting formulae .",
    "this is to avoid artefacts in following the time evolution of hot subdwarfs produced from a stellar population .",
    "the code needs to model the evolution of binary stars as well as of single stars .",
    "the evolution of binaries is more complicated due to the occurrence of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) .",
    "the binaries of main interest here usually experience two phases of rlof : the first when the primary fills its roche lobe which may produce a wd binary , and the second when the secondary fills its roche lobe .",
    "the mass gainer in the first rlof phase is most likely a main - sequence ( ms ) star .",
    "if the mass ratio @xmath25 at the onset of rlof is lower than a critical value , @xmath26 , rlof is stable @xcite . for systems experiencing their first phase of rlof in the hertzsprung gap , we use @xmath27 as is supported by detailed binary - evolution calculations of han et  al .  .",
    "for the first rlof phase on the fgb or asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , we mainly use @xmath28 .",
    "full binary calculations @xcite demonstrate that @xmath29 is typical for rlof in fgb stars .",
    "we do not explicitly include tidally enhanced stellar winds @xcite in our calculation .",
    "using a larger value for @xmath26 is equivalent to including a tidally enhanced stellar wind to some degree while keeping the simulation simple ( see hpmm for details ) .",
    "alternatively , we also adopt @xmath30 in order to examine the consequences of varying this important criterion .    for stable rlof",
    ", we assume that a fraction @xmath31 of the mass lost from the primary is transferred onto the gainer , while the rest is lost from the system ( @xmath32 means that rlof is conservative ) .",
    "note , however , that we assume that mass transfer is always conservative when the donor is a ms star .",
    "the mass lost from the system also takes away a specific angular momentum @xmath33 in units of the specific angular momentum of the system .",
    "the unit is expressed as @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the separation and @xmath36 is the orbital period of the binary ( see podsiadlowski , joss & hsu 1992 for details ) .",
    "stable rlof usually results in a wide wd binary .",
    "some of the wide wd binaries may contain hot subdwarf stars and ms companions if rlof occurs near the tip of the fgb ( _ 1st stable rlof channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) . in order to reproduce galactic hot subdwarfs , we use @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the first stable rlof in all systems except for those on the ms ( see hpmm for details ) .",
    "if rlof is dynamically unstable , a common envelope ( ce ) may be formed @xcite , and if the orbital energy deposited in the envelope can overcome its binding energy , the ce may be ejected . for the ce ejection criterion , we introduced two model parameters , @xmath39 for the common envelope ejection efficiency and @xmath40 for the thermal contribution to the binding energy of the envelope , which we write as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the orbital energy that is released , @xmath43 is the gravitational binding energy and",
    "@xmath44 is the thermal energy of the envelope .",
    "both @xmath43 and @xmath45 are obtained from full stellar structure calculations ( see han , podsiadlowski & eggleton 1994 for details ; also see dewi & tauris 2000 ) instead of analytical approximations . ce ejection leads to the formation of a close wd binary .",
    "some of the close wd binaries may contain hot subdwarf stars and ms companions if the ce occurs near the tip of the fgb ( _ 1st ce channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath46 in our standard model , and @xmath47 to investigate the effect of varying the ce ejection parameters .",
    "the wd binary formed from the first rlof phase continues to evolve , and the secondary may fill its roche lobe as a red giant .",
    "the system then experiences a second rlof phase .",
    "if the mass ratio at the onset of rlof is greater than @xmath26 given in table  3 of han et  al .",
    ", rlof is dynamically unstable , leading again to a ce phase .",
    "if the ce is ejected , a hot subdwarf star may be formed .",
    "the hot subdwarf binary has a short orbital period and a wd companion ( _ 2nd ce channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) .",
    "however , rlof may be stable if the mass ratio is sufficiently small . in this case",
    ", we assume that the mass lost from the mass donor is all lost from the system , carrying away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the wd companion .",
    "stable rlof may then result in the formation of a hot subdwarf binary with a wd companion and a long orbital period ( typically @xmath48 , _",
    "2nd stable rlof channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) .",
    "if the second rlof phase results in a ce phase and the ce is ejected , a double white dwarf system is formed @xcite .",
    "some of the double wd systems contain two helium wds .",
    "angular momentum loss due to gravitational wave radiation may then cause the shrinking of the orbital separation until the less massive white dwarf starts to fill its roche lobe .",
    "this will lead to its dynamical disruption if @xmath49 or @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the mass of the donor ( i.e. the less massive wd ) and @xmath52 is the mass of the gainer @xcite .",
    "this is expected to always lead to a complete merger of the two white dwarfs .",
    "the merger can also produce a hot subdwarf star , but in this case the hot subdwarf star is a single object ( _ he wd merger channel _ for the formation of hot subdwarfs ) .",
    "if the lighter wd is not disrupted , rlof is stable and an am cvn system is formed .    in this paper",
    ", we do not include a tidally enhanced stellar wind explicitly as was done in han et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) and han ( 1998 ) .",
    "instead we use a standard reimers wind formula ( reimers 1975 ) with @xmath53 @xcite which is included in our stellar models .",
    "this is to keep the simulations as simple as possible , although the effects of a tidally enhanced wind can to some degree be implicitly included by using a larger value of @xmath26 .",
    "we also employ a standard magnetic braking law @xcite where appropriate ( see podsiadlowski , han & rappaport 2002 for details and further discussion ) .      in order to investigate the uv - upturn phenomenon due to hot subdwarfs",
    ", we have performed a series of monte - carlo simulations where we follow the evolution of a sample of a million binaries ( single stars are in effect treated as very wide binaries that do not interact with each other ) , including the hot subdwarfs produced in the simulations , according to our grids of stellar models .",
    "the simulations require as input the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) of the primary , the initial mass - ratio distribution and the distribution of initial orbital separations .",
    "\\(1 ) the sfr is taken to be a single starburst in most of our simulations ; all the stars have the same age ( @xmath54 ) and the same metallicity ( @xmath16 ) , and constitute a simple stellar population ( ssp ) . in some simulations a composite stellar population ( csp ) is also used ( section  3.3 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) a simple approximation to the imf of miller & scalo is used ; the primary mass is generated with the formula of eggleton , fitchett & tout , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 . the adopted range of primary masses is 0.8 to @xmath57 .",
    "the studies by kroupa , tout & gilmore and zoccali et  al .",
    "support this imf .",
    "\\(3 ) the mass - ratio distribution is quite uncertain .",

    "this distribution implies that there is an equal number of wide binary systems per logarithmic interval and that approximately 50 per cent of stellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100yr .      in order to obtain the colours and the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the populations produced by our simulations , we have calculated spectra for hot subdwarfs using plane - parallel static model stellar atmospheres computed with the atlas9 stellar atmosphere code @xcite with the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) .",

    "see han et  al .   for further details .",
    "figure  [ channel ] shows the seds of the hot subdwarfs produced from the different formation channels at various ages .",
    "it shows that hot subdwarfs from the rlof channel are always important , while the ce channel becomes important at an age of @xmath131 .",
    "the merger channel , however , catches up with the ce channel at @xmath134 and the stable rlof channel at @xmath135 , and dominates the far - uv flux afterwards .      in order to systematically investigate the dependence of the uv - upturn on the parameters of our model",
    ", we now vary the major model parameters : @xmath93 for the initial mass - ratio distribution , @xmath136 for the critical mass ratio for stable rlof on the fgb or agb , @xmath39 for the ce ejection efficiency and @xmath40 for the thermal contribution to the ce ejection .",
    "we carried out four more simulation sets ( table  [ models ] ) .",
    "figures  [ uvz1 ] and  [ uvz2 ] show the uv - upturn evolution of the various simulation sets .",
    "these figures show that the initial mass - ratio distribution is very important . as an extreme case",
    ", the mass - ratio distribution for uncorrelated component masses ( set 2 ) makes the uv - upturn much weaker , by @xmath137 in @xmath0 or @xmath14 , as compared to the standard simulation set . on the other hand",
    ", a rising distribution ( set 3 ) makes the uv - upturn stronger .",
    "binaries with a mass - ratio distribution of uncorrelated component masses tend to have bigger values of @xmath138 ( the ratio of the mass of the primary to the mass of the secondary ) , and mass transfer is more likely to be unstable . as a result , the numbers of hot subdwarfs from the stable rlof channel and the merger channel are greatly reduced , and the uv - upturn is smaller in strength .",
    "binaries with a rising mass - ratio distribution tend to have smaller values of @xmath138 and therefore produce a larger uv - upturn",
    ". a lower @xmath94 ( set 4 ) leads to a weaker uv - upturn , as the numbers of hot subdwarfs from the stable rlof channel and the merger channel are reduced .",
    "a higher ce ejection efficiency @xmath39 and a higher thermal contribution factor @xmath40 ( set 5 ) result in an increase in the number of hot subdwarfs from the ce channel , but a decrease in the number from the merger channel , and the uv - upturn is not affected much as a consequence .",
    "binaries evolve differently from single stars due to the occurrence of mass transfer .",
    "mass transfer may prevent mass donors from evolving to higher luminosity and can produce hotter objects than expected in a single - star population of a certain age ( mainly hot subdwarfs and blue stragglers ) . to demonstrate the importance of binary interactions for the uv - upturn explicitly , we plotted seds of a population for two cases in figure  [ binary ] .",
    "case 1 ( solid curves ) is for our standard simulation set , which includes various binary interactions , while case 2 ( light grey curves ) is for a population of the same mass without any binary interactions .",
    "the figure shows that the hot subdwarfs produced by binary interactions are the dominant contributors to the far - uv for a population older than @xmath131 .",
    "note , however , that blue stragglers resulting from binary interactions are important contributors to the far - uv between 0.5 gyr and 1.5 gyr .    in order to assess the importance of binary interactions for the uv upturn , we define factors that give the fraction of the flux in a particular waveband that originates from hot subdwarfs produced in binaries : @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the integrated flux between 900   and 1800   radiated by hot subdwarfs ( and their descendants ) produced by binary interactions , and @xmath141 is the total integrated flux between 900   and 1800  .",
    "we also defined other similar factors , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and @xmath144 , for passbands of 1250   to 1850  , 1921   to 2109 , and 2200   to 2800 , respectively .",
    "figure  [ bt ] shows the time evolution of those factors .",
    "as the figure shows , the hot - subdwarf contribution becomes increasingly important in the far- and near - uv as the population ages .",
    "early - type galaxies with a recent minor starburst can be modelled as a composite stellar population ( csp ) .",
    "a csp contains a major population with an age of @xmath95 and a minor population of age @xmath145 and mass fraction @xmath97 ( section  3.3 ) .",
    "figure  [ frfn ] shows the colour  colour diagram for csps with @xmath146 with varying @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "note that the curves of different @xmath97 start to converge to the ssp curve , the curve of @xmath103 , for @xmath147 .",
    "this implies that there exists a strong degeneracy between the age of the minor population and the mass fraction .",
    "in our binary population synthesis model , we adopted solar metallicity . to test the model , we chose ngc 3379 , a typical elliptical galaxy with a metallicity close to solar @xcite to fit the far - uv sed .",
    "figure  [ fitting ] presents various fits that illustrate the effects of different sub - populations with different ages and different amounts of assumed extinction .",
    "as the figure shows , acceptable fits can be obtained for the various cases .",
    "our best fits require the presence of a sub - population of relatively young stars with an age @xmath148gyr , making up @xmath149% of the total population mass .",
    "the existence of a relatively young population could imply the existence of some core - collapse supernovae in these galaxies .",
    "if we assume that an elliptical galaxy has a stellar mass of @xmath150 and @xmath151 of the mass was formed _ during _ the last 0.4gyr , then a mean star formation rate would be @xmath152 , about one tenth that of the galaxy .",
    "core - collapse supernovae would be possible .",
    "indeed , a type ib supernova , sn 2000ds , was discovered in ngc 2768 , an elliptical galaxy of type e6 @xcite",
    ".      there is increasing evidence that many elliptical galaxies had some recent minor star - formation events @xcite , which also contribute to the far - uv excess .",
    "to model such secondary minor starbursts , we have constructed csp galaxy models , consisting of one old , dominant population with an assumed age @xmath153 and a younger population of variable age , making up a fraction @xmath97 of the stellar mass of the system .",
    "our spectral modelling shows that a recent minor starburst mostly affects the slope in the far - uv sed , and we therefore defined a far - uv slope index @xmath89 ( section  2.4 ) . in order to assess the importance of binary interactions",
    ", we also defined a binary contribution factor @xmath154 ( section  4.1.6 ) , which is the fraction of far - uv flux radiated by hot subdwarfs produced by binary interactions .",
    "figure  [ beta ] shows the far - uv slope as a function of uv excess , a potentially powerful diagnostic diagram which illustrates how the uv properties of elliptical galaxies evolve with time in a dominant old population with a young minor sub - population . for comparison",
    ", we also plot observed elliptical galaxies .",
    "some of the observed galaxies are from astro-2 observations with an aperture of @xmath155 @xcite , some are from iue observations with an aperture of @xmath156 @xcite . the value of @xmath89 for ngc 1399 , however , is derived from astro-1 hut observation with an aperture of @xmath157 @xcite , and its @xmath0 comes from the iue observations . as the far - uv light is more concentrated toward the centre of the galaxy than the optical light @xcite , the value of @xmath0 for ngc 1399 should be considered an upper limit for the galaxy area covered by the observation .",
    "the galaxies plotted are all elliptical galaxies except for ngc 5102 , which is a s0 galaxy , and the nucleus of m  31 , which is a sb galaxy .",
    "active galaxies or galaxies with large errors in @xmath89 from bbbfl have not been plotted .",
    "overall , the model covers the observed range of properties reasonably well .",
    "note in particular that the majority of galaxies lie in the part of the diagram where the uv contribution from binaries is expected to dominate ( i.e. where @xmath158 ) .",
    "the location of m  60 and m  89 in this figure implies @xmath159 and @xmath160 with @xmath161 .",
    "interestingly , inspection of the hut spectrum of m  60 ( see the mid - left panel of figure  3 in brown et  al .  ) shows the presence of a marginal c  iv absorption line near 1550 .",
    "chandra observations show that m  89 has a low luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "this would make @xmath0 bluer and may also provide indirect evidence for low levels of star formation .",
    "the galaxy ngc 1399 requires special mention , as it is uv - bright and the young star - hypothesis was believed to have been ruled out due to the lack of strong c  iv absorption lines in its hut spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , any young star signature , if it exists , would have been diluted greatly in the hut spectrum , as the aperture of the hut observation is much larger than that of the iue observation covering mainly the galaxy nucleus .",
    "our model is sensitive to both low levels and high levels of star formation .",
    "it suggests that elliptical galaxies had some star formation activity in the relatively recent past ( @xmath162gyr ago ) .",
    "agn and supernova activity may provide qualitative supporting evidence for this picture , since the former often appears to be accompanied by active star formation , while supernovae , both core collapse and thermonuclear , tend to occur mainly within 12gyr after a starburst in the most favoured supernova models . in figure  [ beta ] , we have plotted 13 early - type galaxies altogether . using the padova - asiago supernova online catalogue , which lists supernovae recorded ever since 1885 , we found 8 supernovae in six of the galaxies : sn 1885a ( type i ) in m  31 , sn 1969q ( type unavailable ) in m  49 , sn 2004w ( type ia ) in m  60 , sn 1939b ( type i ) in m  59 , sn 1957b ( type ia ) , sn 1980i ( type ia ) , sn 1991bg ( type ia ) in m  84 and sn 1935b ( type unavailable ) in ngc 3115 .",
    "the majority of supernovae in these galaxies appear to be of type ia .",
    "similar to the above subsection , we have constructed composite stellar population models for elliptical galaxies consisting of a major old population ( @xmath153 ) and a minor younger population , but for colour - colour diagrams .",
    "figure  [ 15v ] shows the appearance of a galaxy in the colour - colour diagrams of @xmath0 versus @xmath79 ( panel ( a ) ) and @xmath1 versus @xmath79 ( panel ( b ) ) in the csp model for different fractions @xmath97 and different ages of the minor population .",
    "solid squares in panel ( a ) of the figure are for quiescent early - type galaxies observed with iue by bbbfl and the data points are taken from table  2 of dorman , oconnell & wood .",
    "the observed data points are located in a region without recent star formation or with a very low level of recent star formation ( @xmath163 ) . therefore , the observations are naturally explained with our model .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the epoch when the effects of the starburst fade away , leading to a fast evolution of the galaxy colours , and the diagram therefore provides a potentially powerful diagnostic to identify a minor starburst in an otherwise old elliptical galaxy that occurred up to @xmath164gyr ago . for larger ages ,",
    "the curves tend to converge in the @xmath79 versus @xmath0 diagram .",
    "note that this is not so much the case in the @xmath79 versus @xmath1 diagram , which therefore could provide better diagnostics .",

    "cgcg 119053 , cgcg 97125 , vcc 1499 ( the three solid squares with big stars ) showed hints of star formation , ngc 4168 ( the solid square with a big triangle ) has a low - luminosity seyfert nucleus and cgcg 119030 ( the solid square with a big diamond ) could be a spiral galaxy instead of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "however , no hint of star formation has been found for vcc 616 ( the solid square on the far - left above the line @xmath166 ) and cgcg 119086 ( the solid square on the far - right above the line @xmath166 ) .",

    "is satisfactorily explained by our model .",
    "brown et  al",
    ".   showed with hst observations that the uv - upturn does not evolve much with redshift , a result apparently confirmed by rich et  al .   with galex observation of a large sample .",
    "this is contrary to the prediction of both the metal - poor and the metal - rich model , as both models require a large age for the hot subdwarfs and therefore predict that the uv - upturn should decline rapidly with redshift .",
    "our binary model , however , predicts that that uv - upturn does not evolve much with redshift ( see figures  [ uvz1 ] and  [ uvz2 ] ) , consistent with the recent observations .",
    "lee et  al .   and ree et  al",
    ".   studied the look - back time evolution of the uv - upturn from the brightest elliptical galaxies in 12 clusters at redshift @xmath177 with galex .",
    "compared to local giant elliptical galaxies , they found that the uv - upturn of the 12 galaxies is redder .",
    "however , the local giant elliptical galaxies are quite special .",
    "ngc 1399 and m  87 , with the strongest uv - upturn , have the largest known specific frequencies of globular clusters @xcite , and m  87 hosts an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with the best - known jet @xcite .",
    "given a larger sample of elliptical galaxies , no matter how luminous they are , and a bigger redshift range , the uv - upturn is not found to decline with redshift .",
    "boselli et  al .",
    "studied the uv properties of 264 early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster with galex .",
    "they showed that @xmath15 ranges from 3 to 0 , consistent with the theoretical range shown in panel ( b ) of figure  [ uvz2 ] .",
    "the colour index @xmath15 of those galaxies becomes bluer with luminosity from dwarfs ( @xmath178 ) to giants ( @xmath179 ) , i.e. a luminous galaxy tends to have a bluer @xmath15 .",
    "panel ( b ) of figure  [ uvz2 ] shows that @xmath15 becomes bluer with population age for @xmath180 .",
    "taking the stellar populations as an `` averaged '' ssp , we may conclude that a luminous early - type galaxy is older , or in other words , the less luminous an early - type galaxy is , the younger the stellar population is or the later the population formed .      as far as we know",
    ", metallicity does not play a significant role in the mass - transfer process or the envelope ejection process for the formation of hot subdwarfs , although it may affect the properties of the binary population in more subtle ways .",
    "we therefore expect that @xmath14 or @xmath0 from our model is not very sensitive to the metallicity of the population , this is in agreement with the recent large sample of galex observations by rich et  al .  .",
    "boselli et  al .   and donas et  al .",
    "studied nearby early - type galaxies with galex .",
    "neither of them show that @xmath14 correlates significantly with metallicity , however , both of them found a positive correlation between @xmath15 and metallicity .",
    "this can possibly be explained with our model .",
    "the uv - upturn magnitudes @xmath14 or @xmath0 does not evolve much with age for @xmath181 while @xmath15 decreases significantly with age ( see figures  [ uvz1 ] and  [ uvz2 ] ) .",
    "a galaxy of high metallicity may have a larger age and therefore a stronger @xmath15 .",
    "both metal - poor and metal - rich models are quite _ ad hoc _ and require a large age for the hot subdwarf population ( section  1 ) , which implies that the uv - upturn declines rapidly with look - back time or redshift . in our model ,",
    "hot subdwarfs are produced naturally by envelope loss through binary interactions , which do not depend much on the age of the population older than @xmath131 , and therefore our model predicts little if any evolution of the uv - upturn with redshift .",
    "note , however , that @xmath15 declines significantly more with redshift than @xmath14 , as the contribution to the near - uv from blue stragglers resulting from binary interactions becomes less important for an older population .",
    "the metal - rich model predicts a positive correlation between the magnitude of the uv - upturn and metallicity ; for example , @xmath0 correlates with metallicity .",
    "however , such a correlation is not expected from our binary model as metallicity does not play an essential role in the binary interactions .",
    "furthermore , even though the metal - rich model could in principle account for the uv - upturn in old , metal - rich giant ellipticals , it can not produce a uv - upturn in lower - metallicity dwarf ellipticals .",
    "in contrast , in a binary model , the uv - upturn is universal and can account for uv - upturns from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals .",
    "by applying the binary scenario of han et  al .   for the formation of hot subdwarfs",
    ", we have developed an evolutionary population synthesis model for the uv - upturn of elliptical galaxies based on a first - principle approach .",
    "the model is still quite simple and does not take into account more complex star - formation histories , possible contributions to the uv from agn activity , non - solar metallicity or a range of metallicities . moreover , the binary population synthesis is sensitive to uncertainties in the binary modelling itself , in particular the mass - ratio distribution and the condition for stable and unstable mass transfer @xcite .",
    "we have varied these parameters and found these uncertainties do not change the qualitative picture , but affect some of the quantitative estimates .    despite its simplicity , our model can successfully reproduce most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a uv excess : the range of observed uv excesses , both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( e.g.  deharveng , boselli & donas , 2002 ) , and their evolution with redshift . the model predicts that the uv excess is not a strong function of age , and hence is not a good indicator for the age of the dominant old population , as has been argued previously @xcite , but is very consistent with recent galex findings @xcite .",
    "we typically find that the @xmath0 colour changes rapidly over the first 1gyr and only varies slowly thereafter .",
    "this also implies that all old galaxies should show a uv excess at some level .",
    "moreover , we expect that the model is not very sensitive to the metallicity of the population .",
    "the uv - upturn is therefore expected to be universal .    our model is sensitive to both low levels and high levels of star formation .",
    "it suggests that elliptical galaxies had some star formation activity in the relatively recent past ( @xmath162gyr ago ) .",
    "agn and supernova activity may provide supporting evidence for this picture .",
    "the modelling of the uv excess presented in this study is only a starting point : with refinements in the spectral modelling , including metallicity effects , and more detailed modelling of the global evolution of the stellar population in elliptical galaxies , we propose that this becomes a powerful new tool helping to unravel the complex histories of elliptical galaxies that a long time ago looked so simple and straightforward .",

    "<S> the discovery of a flux excess in the far - ultraviolet ( uv ) spectrum of elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969 . while it is now clear that this uv excess is caused by an old population of hot helium - burning stars without large hydrogen - rich envelopes , rather than young stars , their origin has remained a mystery . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that these stars most likely lost their envelopes because of binary interactions , similar to the hot subdwarf population in our own galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> we have developed an evolutionary population synthesis model for the far - uv excess of elliptical galaxies based on the binary model developed by han et  al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2002 , 2003 ) for the formation of hot subdwarfs in our galaxy . despite its simplicity </S>",
    "<S> , it successfully reproduces most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a uv excess : the range of observed uv excesses , both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and their evolution with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we also present colour - colour diagrams for use as diagnostic tools in the study of elliptical galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the model has major implications for understanding the evolution of the uv excess and of elliptical galaxies in general . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , it implies that the uv excess is not a sign of age , as had been postulated previously , and predicts that it should not be strongly dependent on the metallicity of the population , but exists universally from dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals .    </S>",
