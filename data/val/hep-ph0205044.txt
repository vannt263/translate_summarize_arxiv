    "both the origin and nature of dark matter and the production mechanism of the baryon ( matter  antimatter ) asymmetry in the present universe are among the most fundamental puzzles in cosmology and in particle physics . of the many candidates for dark matter",
    ", the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) has been attracting wide interest as an ideal candidate , which is inherent in the supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model , and it is exactly stable under the @xmath0-parity conservation .    on the other hand , once we introduce susy in the standard model , there appear a number of flat directions in the scalar potential carrying baryon ( @xmath1 ) and/or lepton ( @xmath2 ) number .",
    "affleck and dine ( ad ) proposed an interesting mechanism  @xcite to generate effectively a baryon asymmetry by using these flat directions .",
    "because of the flatness of the potential , it is quite plausible that a linear combination of squark and/or slepton fields has a large expectation value along a flat direction during the inflation in the early universe . after the end of inflation",
    ", this flat direction field @xmath3 starts a coherent oscillation . at this stage , due to baryon ( and/or lepton ) number - violating operators in the scalar potential , the @xmath3 field gets a non - zero motion along the phase direction as well , which means nothing but baryon ( and/or lepton ) number generation since the @xmath3 carries a baryon ( and/or lepton ) number .",
    "recently , we have pointed out that the higgsino- or wino - like neutralino naturally becomes the dominant component of the dark matter , if either of them is the lsp and if the ad mechanism is responsible for the generation of the observed baryon asymmetry in the present universe  @xcite .",
    "the lsp is produced non - thermally by the late - time decay of the q - balls , which are generally formed in the ad mechanism  @xcite .",
    "then , the large pair annihilation cross section of the higgsino- or wino - like lsp leads to the desired mass density of dark matter , instead of overclosing the universe , as in the case of the standard bino lsp .",
    "it should be noticed that the typical decay temperature of the q - ball is between @xmath4 and ( a few)@xmath5 , i.e. below the freeze - out temperature of the lsp and before the big - bang nucleosynthesis , which is just the desired range for the present scenario . in this scenario , it is very interesting that both the dark matter and the baryon asymmetry are produced by a single source , the q - ball decay , which originates from the ad condensation .",
    "furthermore , the relatively strong interactions of these lsps significantly enlarge the possibility of detecting these dark matter candidates in both direct and indirect searches .    in this paper , we give more detailed analyses of this scenario , `` higgsino or wino dark matter from q - ball decay '' , adopting several susy breaking models , which include the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) scenario , the anomaly - mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) model  @xcite with additional universal scalar mass , and the no - scale model with non - universal gaugino masses  @xcite . in each model",
    ", we will show parameter regions in which the lsp from the q - ball decay can be the dominant component of the dark matter .",
    "this predicts new cosmologically interesting parameter regions , which have not attracted much attention ; the wino dark matter is realized in wide parameter regions in the amsb models and the no - scale models , where the non - thermal wino production via decays of q - balls naturally explains the mass density of the dark matter . even in the msugra scenario ,",
    "higgsino dark matter is realized in a relatively wide region by virtue of the `` focus point '' behaviour of @xmath6  @xcite , in which the mass density of dark matter is explained by the non - thermally produced higgsino .",
    "we also investigate the direct and indirect detection of the neutralino dark matter in these regions .",
    "we calculate the proton  neutralino scalar cross section for the direct detection . as for the indirect detection",
    ", we adopt the @xmath7 annihilation channel , which produces monoenergetic @xmath8-ray lines .",
    "we estimate the neutralino annihilation rate into the @xmath9 final state using the full one - loop calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss the possibility of detection in the next generation of air cherenkov telescopes for several models of density profile in the halo .",
    "actually , the large higgsino or wino content of the lsp strongly enhances the direct and indirect detection rates , via the higgs exchange diagrams and the chargino  w boson loop diagrams , respectively . as we will see , if the higgsino or wino is really a significant component of dark matter , there exists an intriguing possibility to detect these non - thermal dark matter candidates in various next - generation detectors .",
    "note that , if the higgsino- or wino - like dark matter is indeed detected at future experiments , it suggests the existence of non - thermal sources for these lsps , which predicts a highly non - trivial history of the universe .",
    "this might discriminate the origin of the baryon asymmetry between various scenarios .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : first , we reexamine the ad baryogenesis scenario , giving particular attention to the late - time decay of q - balls in section  [ sec - ad ] .",
    "this includes an interesting new twist in the ad baryogenesis using non - renormalizable operators in the khler potential to rotate the ad field .",
    "this scenario is now able to explain the observed baryon asymmetry without any assumptions of additional large entropy production to dilute the resultant baryon asymmetry , such as decays of heavy moduli fields and/or a thermal inflation . in section  [ sec - q ] , we review the properties of the q - ball in the minimal susy standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "we discuss the non - thermal production of the lsp dark matter from the q - ball decay in section  [ sec - lspfromq - general ] .",
    "our main results are given in section  [ sec - main ] .",
    "we show in several susy breaking models the parameter spaces where the higgsino- and wino - like lsps from the q - ball decay can be the dominant component of the dark matter , and we investigate their direct and indirect detection in detail",
    ". we also comment on the possibility that the non - thermally produced neutralino via the late - time decays of q - balls form the warm dark matter , which erases the cuspy profile of the matter density of the halo that might be inconsistent with the observations .",
    "we present concluding remarks and discussions in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "in this section we briefly review the affleck  dine mechanism  @xcite in the mssm .",
    "hereafter , we assume @xmath0-parity conservation and the following superpotential at renormalizable level as usual : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath2 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote superfields of left - handed quark doublets , right - handed up - type and down - type quarks , left - handed lepton doublets , right - handed charged leptons and higgs doublets , respectively ; we omit the family indices for simplicity . in the scalar potential",
    ", there are a number of flat directions along which the @xmath17-term potential coming from the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ eq - wren ] ) as well as the @xmath18-term potential vanish  @xcite : @xmath19 where the ellipsis denotes the flat directions consisting of linear combinations with more scalar fields . in the following , we will parametrize a flat direction by a complex scalar field @xmath3 .      in the supersymmetric limit",
    ", the flat directions are lifted only by non - renormalizable operators in the scalar potential .",
    "let us first assume that all the non - renormalizable operators consistent with the mssm gauge symmetry and the @xmath0-parity exist in the superpotential .",
    "most of the flat directions are then lifted by the scalar potential coming from the following dimension-4 superpotentials : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes effective scales at which these non - renormalizable operators are induced .",
    "here and hereafter , we discard superpotentials that conserve the baryon and lepton numbers ( e.g. @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) , since they can not generate baryon asymmetry .",
    "we have included superpotentials conserving @xmath24 , since the q - ball can decay after the electroweak phase transition and the baryon asymmetry is not washed out by the sphaleron effect  @xcite .",
    "some of remaining flat directions are lifted by the following dimension-6 superpotentials : @xmath25 all the other flat directions are lifted either by @xmath1- and @xmath2- conserving superpotentials or by superpotentials of the form @xmath26  @xcite . in the latter case , one can show that @xmath27 becomes zero when the @xmath3 field develops a large vacuum expectation value .",
    "therefore , this type of superpotential can not provide a non - zero @xmath28-term that is indispensable to create a net baryon / lepton asymmetry as will be discussed soon .",
    "thus , in the following , we write the superpotential that lifts a flat direction @xmath3 as @xmath29 with @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "note that we have normalized the effective scale @xmath21 including the coupling @xmath32 , and hence @xmath21 can be larger than the cut - off scale ( e.g. planck scale ) .    in the case of the leptonic flat direction ( e.g. @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , lepton asymmetry is first generated by the ad mechanism .",
    "then a part of the produced lepton asymmetry is converted  @xcite into baryon asymmetry through the sphaleron effect .",
    "in particular , leptogenesis via the @xmath33 flat direction  @xcite has attracted much attention  @xcite , since in this case the baryon asymmetry in the present universe is directly related to the neutrino mass .",
    "this allows us to obtain definite predictions on the rate of the neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", however , we do not consider the @xmath33 flat direction since the resultant q - ball along this direction is very small and evaporates well above the weak scale  @xcite .",
    "as for the other leptonic flat directions , large q - balls can be formed .",
    "however , the q - balls must decay or evaporate well before the sphaleron effect terminates ( @xmath35 ) , which requires some mechanisms to make q - balls small enough  @xcite . in this case , the lsps produced by the decays of q - balls are thermalized and the bino - like lsp is the almost unique candidate for neutralino dark matter .",
    "we do not treat such cases in the following discussions , and concentrate on the flat directions carrying non - zero baryon number .",
    "let us now discuss the ad mechanism with non - renormalizable superpotential .",
    "the relevant scalar potential for @xmath3 is given by @xmath36 here , the potential terms , which are proportional to the soft mass squared @xmath37 and the gravitino mass @xmath38 , come from the susy breaking at the true vacuum .",
    "we will concentrate on gravity - mediated and gaugino - mediated susy breaking models , and take @xmath39 , hereafter .",
    "( we will discuss later the case of anomaly - mediated susy breaking models , where @xmath40 . )",
    "the terms depending on the hubble parameter @xmath41 denote the effect of susy breaking caused by the finite energy density of the inflaton  @xcite : @xmath42 is a real constant of order unity , which depends on the couplings between the inflaton and the @xmath3 field in the khler potential .",
    "hereafter , we take @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , which is crucial to let @xmath3 have a large expectation value during inflation . there",
    "might also exist a hubble - induced @xmath28-term potential , which has the same form as the second term in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , with @xmath41 instead of @xmath38 . , where @xmath45 denotes the inflaton superfield .",
    "this coupling leads to a relatively high reheating temperature of the inflation , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass of the inflaton . therefore , as we will see , the absence of this three - point coupling is also desirable for obtaining the low reheating temperature that explains the right amount of baryon asymmetry .",
    "notice that @xmath43 does not need this three - point coupling , which is consistent with the low reheating temperatures . ] even in the presence of this term , the following discussions are not altered , so we assume its absence in the present work , for simplicity .",
    "the last term is the @xmath17-term potential coming from the superpotential in eq .",
    "( [ eq - w ] ) . here , we assume the absence of thermal effects , which will be justified later .",
    "the estimation of the baryon asymmetry is rather straightforward .",
    "the baryon number density is related to the ad field as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the corresponding baryon charge of the ad field , which is at most @xmath50 .",

    "the negative hubble mass term @xmath57 causes an instability of the flat direction field @xmath3 around the origin , and the ad field acquires a large expectation value : @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "this is the balance point between the negative hubble mass term @xmath60 and the @xmath17-term potential @xmath61 .",
    "note that the curvature along the phase direction @xmath62 is much smaller than @xmath63 at this point , since @xmath64 therefore , the initial phase of the ad field fixed during inflation does not generally coincide with the minimum of the @xmath28-term potential in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) , and hence we naturally expect that @xmath65 .",
    "after the end of inflation , the ad field slowly rolls down toward the origin following the gradual decrease of the hubble parameter @xmath41 as @xmath66 . at this slow rolling regime , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ b - number ] ) increases as @xmath67 . here",
    ", we have assumed the matter - dominated universe , which is true as long as @xmath68 . when @xmath69 , the soft mass term of the ad field eventually dominates the negative hubble mass term , and causes the coherent oscillation of the ad field around the origin .",
    "after this time , the amplitude of the ad field rapidly decreases as @xmath70 , and then the production of the baryon number terminates at the time @xmath71 .    using the above arguments and eq .",
    "( [ b - number ] ) , we obtain the baryon number density at the time @xmath72 : @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "then , after completion of the reheating process of the inflation , this leads to the following baryon asymmetry : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the reheating temperature of the inflation , @xmath77 is the entropy density of the universe and @xmath78 is the reduced planck scale . by using @xmath79 , it is given by @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "these quantities remain constant unless there are additional entropy productions .    these predictions on the baryon asymmetry",
    "are not altered by the presence of the q - ball formation , as long as the produced q - balls are unstable and decay before the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "the details related to the q - balls will be discussed in section  [ sec - q ] .",
    "the only point remaining to be checked is the absence of the thermal effects . in the remainder of this section",

    "+   +   @xmath84    in the case of the @xmath81 superpotential , it was pointed out that the thermal effects cause the early oscillations of the ad field @xmath85 , which significantly suppress the resultant baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "analytic and more systematic investigations were done for the case of the leptogenesis via the @xmath86 flat direction , which revealed an interesting property , the `` reheating temperature independence '' of the baryon asymmetry  @xcite . for the other flat directions , however , there are some subtleties .",
    "the dimension-5 operators coming from the superpotential @xmath87 are responsible for the proton decay  @xcite .",
    "null observations of the proton decay then lead to strong constraints   superpotential , and two other operators are operative for ad baryogenesis besides @xmath88 , such as @xmath89 , @xmath90 . ] on the effective cut - off scale , @xmath91 , at least for the most relevant operators  @xcite . following the analyses in ref .",
    "@xcite , one can show that there is no thermal effect as long as @xmath92 when @xmath93 , and hence there is no need to worry about the thermal effects in these scenarios .",
    "as we will see , such a large scale of @xmath21 leads to the formation of very large q - balls with the decay temperature @xmath94 . since the decays of the q - balls occur well after the sphaleron effect terminates , the baryon asymmetry is not washed out , although the relevant flat directions conserve the @xmath24 symmetry .",
    "+   + @xmath95    in the case of the @xmath83 superpotential , it is much easier to avoid the thermal effects because the potential is much flatter than in the @xmath81 case . for the appearance of the thermal mass terms",
    ", the fields coupled with the @xmath3 field must reside in the thermal bath : @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the yukawa or gauge coupling constant of the ad field . then",
    ", the sufficient condition to avoid the thermal mass terms is written as @xmath98 another thermal effect we have to check comes from the thermal logarithmic potential  @xcite : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is a constant given by the fourth power of gauge and/or yukawa coupling constants . to avoid the early oscillations due to this potential , we need the following condition : @xmath101 which leads to the comparable constraint on the reheating temperature as eq .",

    ", the early oscillations due to the thermal effects can be easily avoided as long as @xmath102 in ad baryo / leptogenesis with @xmath83 superpotential .",
    "the other interesting possibility is that non - renormalizable operators in the superpotential are forbidden by some chiral symmetries , such as @xmath0-symmetry . in this case , the initial amplitude of the ad field is determined by the negative hubble mass term @xmath60 and the non - renormalizable operators in the khler potential and is expected to be @xmath103 .    in this section , as an example , we consider the following terms  @xcite , which are consistent with @xmath0-symmetry : @xmath104 where @xmath105 s are coupling constants and @xmath106 is the superfield with the non - vanishing @xmath17-term responsible for the susy breaking in the true vacuum .",
    "the effective potential of the ad field induced by these terms and susy breaking effects is then given by @xmath107 where @xmath32 is a coupling constant and the ellipsis denotes the higher order terms coming from the khler potential .",

    "( [ eq - motion ] ) .",
    "the baryon number production completes as soon as the ad field starts the coherent oscillation around the origin at @xmath109 . in this scenario , the ad field is completely decoupled from thermal backgrounds , and the early oscillation of the ad field @xmath110 thus does not occur .    a crucial difference appearing in this scenario",
    "is the existence of a large entropy production due to decays of the ad field . at the reheating process of the inflation",
    ", the energy density of the inflaton is converted into the radiation .",
    "after that , the energy density of the radiation reduces as @xmath111 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ad field starts the coherent oscillation at @xmath109 with the initial amplitude @xmath112 , and its energy density only reduces as @xmath113 . then the ad field begins to dominate the energy density of the universe at some time , and substantial entropy is produced through decays of the ad field .",
    "the ad field dominates the energy density of the universe before its decay if the following condition is satisfied : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the decay temperature of the @xmath3 field , which corresponds to the decay temperature of the q - ball and much lower than the weak scale , @xmath116 . in eq .",
    "( [ e - dominance ] ) , we have assumed that the coherent oscillation of the ad field starts before the completion of the reheating process of the inflation . if this is not the case , i.e. if @xmath117 , the condition on @xmath115 becomes weaker than this case .    after the decays of the ad field , the resultant baryon asymmetry is given by the following simple form : @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes the total number density of @xmath3 and anti-@xmath3 field .",
    "the ratio of baryon to @xmath3 number is easily estimated by an argument similar to the one given in the previous section as @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",

    "before the discovery of the formation of large q - balls , decays of the ad field have been considered to occur at @xmath123 .",

    "the resultant ratio of @xmath3-number to entropy is given by @xmath124 , which requires a very small ratio of baryon to @xmath3-number @xmath125 .",
    "such a small ratio results in a very unnatural fine tuning on @xmath32 and/or @xmath126 , and hence additional large entropy productions have been considered to be necessary after the decays of the ad field , such as a thermal inflation or decays of heavy moduli fields .",
    "interestingly enough , the large initial amplitude of the ad field results in the formation of very large q - balls with low decay temperature @xmath127 .. ] this significantly enhances the entropy production via decays of the ad fields and naturally explains the observed baryon asymmetry .",
    "higgsino or wino lsp is the necessary condition for this scenario to work , so as not to overclose the universe and explain the right amount of dark matter .",
    "a quite beautiful point in this scenario is that the resultant baryon asymmetry and dark matter density are solely determined by the sector related to the ad field and annihilation cross section of the lsp .",
    "any other process can not affect the final result as long as the ad fields ( stored in the q - balls ) dominate the energy density of the universe at their decay time .",
    "especially , the final baryon asymmetry is completely independent of the reheating temperature of the inflation .",

    "therefore , the order of the gravitino mass is estimated as @xmath133 .",
    "a crucial point is that the ad mechanism always uses the non - renormalizable operators to violate baryon and/or lepton number , which also violate the super - weyl symmetry at tree level .",

    "they may also cause a serious problem by diluting the baryon asymmetry .    in our scenario , the reasonable set of parameters in the scalar potential of the ad field to explain the observed baryon asymmetry naturally leads to the desirable decay temperature of the q - balls for the non - thermal production of these lsps in various susy breaking scenarios .",

    "+ finally , we add a brief comment on the fine tunings on the soft susy breaking parameters to explain the mass density of dark matter for a given decay temperature of a q - ball .",
    "as we have discussed in the text , the dominant annihilation channel of the higgsino- and wino - like lsp is given by the decay channel into a pair of gauge bosons via the lightest chargino exchange .",
    "this means that the annihilation cross section of these lsps are rather stable under the variation of other soft parameters , such as slepton and squark masses .",
    "( note that the variation of the squark masses has only a mild effect on the size of @xmath304-term in the focus point region . ) consequently , no strong fine tuning on the soft susy breaking parameters is required for a given decay temperature of a q - ball .",

    "<S> the formation and late time decays of q - balls are generic consequences of the affleck  dine ( ad ) baryogenesis . a substantial amount of the lightest supersymmetry ( susy ) particles ( lsps ) are produced non - thermally as the decay products of these q - balls . </S>",

    "<S> we have reexamined the ad baryogenesis with special attention to the late - time decays of the q - balls , and then specified the parameter regions where the lsps produced by the q - ball decays result in a cosmologically interesting mass density of dark matter by adopting several susy breaking models . </S>",
    "<S> this reveals new cosmologically interesting parameter regions , which have not attracted much attention so far . </S>",
