    "the casimir force @xcite between uncharged metallic plates , predicted in 1948 as a quantum electrodynamics effect , only recently became a subject of systematic experimental investigation .",
    "the reason is that nowadays with the development of microtechnologies a reliable control of the separations between bodies smaller than 1 @xmath7 became possible .",
    "a variety of methods have been used to measure the force . in the torsion pendulum experiment @xcite ,",
    "first in the modern series , the force between a sphere and a plate covered with gold was measured with the accuracy of 5% .",
    "a significant progress was achieved in the atomic force microscope ( afm ) experiments @xcite , where the sphere was attached to a cantilever .",
    "the force was deduced from the cantilever bending when the plate was approaching the sphere . in this experiment",
    "the force was measured with a 1% precision . the best result using afm @xcite",
    "was found when the sphere and the plate were covered with gold and special care was taken to control the surface roughness of metal .",
    "the same precision was reached in the crossed cylinders experiment @xcite , where extremely smooth gold films were used .",
    "sophisticated microelectromechanical system ( mems ) @xcite was used to measure the force between the gold plated sphere and a suspended paddle .",
    "it demonstrated the nonlinear behavior of the mechanical oscillator due to the casimir force .",
    "the only experiment , where the force was measured in the plate - plate geometry @xcite , was done using an oscillating beam whose resonance frequency changed in response to the force . up to date , the most precise experiment @xcite explored the mems device similar to that in ref .",
    "the precision was improved due to the use of the dynamical method .",
    "additionally the change in the resonance frequency of the mechanical oscillator was measured using the phase jump instead of resonance behavior of the amplitude . in this way the force was found with the relative accuracy of 0.25% @xcite .    to draw any conclusion from the experiments one has to predict the force theoretically with the precision comparable with the experimental errors . in its original form",
    ", the casimir force @xcite    @xmath8    was calculated between the ideal metals .",
    "it depends only on the fundamental constants and the distance between the plates @xmath9 .",

    "these parameters can be extracted from the optical data at the lowest accessible frequencies . in this way",
    "the force has been calculated @xcite with the highest possible precision .",
    "there is some disagreement between the results of different authors connected with the choice of the relaxation frequency @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "these details are important at small separations .    in refs .",
    "@xcite it was stressed that using the handbook optical data one finds not the actual force but rather the upper limit on the casimir force .",
    "the reason is that the handbooks comprise the data for the best samples ; any material imperfection will reduce the reflectivity and , as a result , the force will be smaller . in the experiments",
    "the force is measured between the bodies covered with a metal .",
    "the metal is deposited on a substrate with the evaporation or sputtering technics @xcite .",
    "the resulting film thickness is typically in the range @xmath18 .",
    "it was already noted @xcite that the optical properties of the films can deviate significantly from those of the bulk material .",
    "the main reasons for these deviations such as voids in the films and electron scattering on the grain boundaries were indicated recently @xcite and the methods to estimate the effects were outlined . for the afm @xcite and mems @xcite experiments",
    "the influence of these effects on the force was estimated on the level of 2% .",
    "additional work from the theoretical and experimental sides has to be done to refine these estimates .",
    "an alternative way to calculate the casimir force using the surface impedance of metals instead of the dielectric function was discussed @xcite in the literature .",
    "the general formula for the casimir force in this approach was deduced for the first time in ref .",
    "it is the same lifshitz formula but the reflection coefficients are expressed in terms of the surface impedance . in the cited papers",
    "the approximate leontovich impedance @xcite depending only on frequency was used .",
    "the hope was that in this approach it will be possible to resolve the long standing problem with the temperature correction to the force @xcite .",
    "however , although the impedance approach itself seems reasonable and well motivated , the use of the approximate impedance for the casimir force happened to be unjustified .",
    "the leontovich impedance is well suited for the propagating photons impinging on a metal but for the casimir problem the exact impedance has to be used since the important contribution in the force comes from the evanescent electromagnetic field .",
    "the exact impedance was shown to give the same result for the force as that in the dielectric function approach @xcite .",
    "the surface impedance is the only way to describe the interaction between the electromagnetic field and metal in the case when the relation between current and electric field in the metal becomes nonlocal .",
    "for example , at low temperatures the mean free path of the electrons in metals becomes larger than the field penetration depth , and the relation between the current and field becomes nonlocal at low frequencies @xcite and the anomalous skin effect is realized . in connection with the casimir force the contribution of this effect in the temperature correction was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand at high frequencies",
    "@xmath19 the charge density fluctuations can propagate in the material ( plasmons ) taking away the energy from the incoming field .",
    "this is also an example of nonlocal effect which was shown to give a significant correction to the casimir force @xcite at small separations between bodies . in the nonlocal case",
    "both time and space dispersion happen and the dielectric function depends not only on frequency @xmath20 but also on the wave vector @xmath21 . actually in this case one has to separate two dielectric functions : the longitudinal function @xmath22 , which describes material response to the longitudinal ( in respect to @xmath21 ) electric field , and the transverse dielectric function @xmath23 describing the response to the transverse field . a systematic way to calculate the surface impedances via the dielectric functions and explicit expressions for these functions",
    "were given in a series of classical papers by kliewer and fuchs @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to provide the basis for systematic investigation of the corrections to the casimir force due to the nonlocal effects .",
    "here we consider only the minor corrections which appear at low frequencies @xmath24 but introduce a general approach which is true at any frequencies .",
    "this approach is not new in the condensed matter physics but it has never been discussed before in connection with the casimir effect .",
    "we deliberately do not consider here the correction to the force in the nonzero temperature case though our conclusions about the low frequency behavior of the impedances for two polarization states will be important for the discussion of the temperature correction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] the main definitions are introduced allowing to calculate the impedances for two polarization states via the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions .",
    "the explicit expressions for the nonlocal dielectric functions in the boltzmann approximation are given .",
    "the impedances are calculated first for propagating fields to compare the calculations with the known results .",
    "then we discuss the continuation procedure to the range of evanescent fields and calculate the impedances at imaginary frequencies to put them later in the lifshitz formula .",
    "the low frequency behavior of these impedances important for the thermal correction to the casimir force is discussed specifically . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the actual calculations of the correction to the casimir force due to nonlocal effects are presented for plate - plate and sphere - plate geometry . the discussion and concluding remarks are given in secs .",
    "[ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] .",
    "the anomalous skin effect was incorporated into the general theory of the optical properties of metals with the detailed paper by reuter and sondheimer @xcite ; the qualitative description was given earlier by pippard @xcite .",
    "pippard was the first to point out that , in general , the electric field inside a metal can not be considered as spatially constant . in general , the connection between the current and the field becomes nonlocal .",
    "the current is given by a definite integral involving the values of the electric field at all points in the metal , and the maxwell s equations therefore lead to integro - differential equation from which the electric field has to be determined .",
    "the expression for the current was deduced @xcite at the conditions that the electrons can be considered as quasi - free and the collision mechanism can always be described in terms of a mean free path @xmath25 or , alternatively , a relaxation frequency @xmath17 .",
    "the mean free path was assumed to be independent on the direction of motion .",
    "an additional assumption about the electron reflection off the surface was introduced by pippard : a fraction @xmath26 of the electrons arriving at the surface is scattered specularly , while the rest are scattered diffusely",
    ". only normal incidence of the electromagnetic field on the metal was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , it was stressed in the kliewer and fuchs paper @xcite that the theory of anomalous skin effect can be considered complete only when arbitrary incidence is taken into account .",
    "the relation between the current density and the electric field can be found solving the boltzmann equation if the free electrons and field wavelengths large compared to the wavelength of an electron at the fermi surface .",
    "for the description of the anomalous skin effect it is a valid approximation . in general",
    ", this relation can be found in different approximations using the linear response theory @xcite .",
    "following kliever and fuchs @xcite we consider a plane wave of angular frequency @xmath27 incident from vacuum at an angle @xmath28 upon the surface of metallic half - space .",

    "one can separate two polarization states for the wave . for the @xmath29 polarized wave the electric field",
    "is directed in the @xmath30 axis , while for the @xmath31 polarized wave the electric field is in the @xmath32 plane and has nonzero @xmath33 component . for clarity",

    "since this component will play significant role in what follows , we will use for it also a special notation @xmath39 , which is settled in the field of the casimir force .",

    "furthermore , the right hand side in eq .",
    "( [ maxfour ] ) is undefined until we find a relation between the two derivatives at the surface .",

    "we assume that the electrons scatter elastically from the surface ( specular reflection ) .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to assuming an infinitely extended medium , needed to obtain eq .",

    "it was stressed that , in general , a metal had to be described with two different surface impedances corresponding to @xmath29 and @xmath31 polarizations and these impedances depend not only on frequency but also on the wave vector along the metal surface . as a specific problem we considered the correction to the casimir force in the region of the anomalous skin effect ( @xmath220 ) .",
