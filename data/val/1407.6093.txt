    "complex bandstructure @xmath3 describes the properties of both propagating and evanescent electronic states in semiconductor crystals .",
    "evanescent states have imaginary or complex wavevectors and govern tunneling phenomena @xcite in semiconductor devices . the relative importance of these phenomena has increased with every reduction in the dimensions of these devices .",
    "complex bandstructure is also used to predict barrier heights of metal - semiconductor interfaces @xcite and band lineups at semiconductor heterointerfaces @xcite , via the theory of virtual induced gap states ( vigs ) .",
    "an accurate computation of complex bandstructure is hence essential for the continued scaling and materials engineering of electronic devices , with an aim of improving performance .    of the many approaches to bandstructure calculation",
    ", the @xmath4 nearest neighbour empirical tight binding method @xcite has proven to represent a good trade - off between accuracy and computational efficiency .",
    "complex bands along a given transport direction @xmath1 can be computed within this framework by casting schrdinger s equation as a generalized polynomial eigenvalue problem ( gpep ) , as described in @xcite for the @xmath5 $ ] direction .",
    "this method can be extended @xcite to a general @xmath1 , by working with a set of primitive lattice vectors @xmath6 that are adapted to the plane perpendicular to @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath8 . as shown in figure [ fig_twodimensionalcrystal ] and described in section [ sec_primitive ] , the order of the gpep depends on @xmath1 , since @xmath9 is not necessarily parallel to @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the computation of complex bands along an arbitrary @xmath1 could involve a gpep of large order .",
    "moreover , arbitrary extrinsic strain can lead to a gpep of large order even for transport along simple directions like @xmath10 $ ] .",
    "robust solution of a gpep of large order is a challenging @xcite problem , sometimes introducing large errors .",
    "the order of the gpep can be limited to be quadratic , even for arbitrary @xmath1 , by working with a non - primitive set of lattice vectors @xcite @xmath11 such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "energy bands obtained using this non - primitive cell correspond , however , to primitive cell energy bands that have been folded onto the smaller , non - primitive brillouin zone .",
    "these bands have to be unfolded onto the primitive brillouin zone .",
    "zone folding and unfolding have been studied extensively for the case of real bands @xcite .",
    "computation of real and complex bands differ in their choice of basis , bloch sums @xcite ( which represent the full periodicity of the lattice ) for the former , whereas layer bloch sums @xcite ( which only represent periodicity in directions perpendicular to @xmath1 ) for the latter . further , unlike wavefunctions with real wavevectors , those with complex wavevectors need to be normalized carefully .",
    "the imaginary part of the wavevector enters into the normalization constant . ignoring this yields different measures for the norm of the wavefunction for different @xmath14 .",
    "it is hence not obvious whether the zone unfolding method derived for real bands can be used to unfold complex bands along a general @xmath1 .",
    "note that @xcite applies the scheme available for real bands to the case of complex bands without providing any rigorous justification .    in this paper",
    ", we show rigorously that the method of unfolding can indeed be used for complex bands too , provided some modifications are included .",
    "our modifications ensures that the measure associated with the projections of the non - primary wavefunction onto all candidate primary wavefunctions is invariant with respect to the energy @xmath2 , for real and complex bands .",
    "this invariance is especially important when the supercell technique @xcite is used to compute the bandstructure of disordered materials .",

    "the primitive vectors @xmath9 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 are constructed using the method described in @xcite . a point in the lattice is represented as @xmath26 where @xmath27 are integers . correspondingly , a vector in reciprocal space is @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 is along @xmath1 .",
    "the crystal is constructed by associating a motif of atoms with each lattice point . for crystals having a zinc blende structure , the motif has two atoms .",

    "complex bands are obtained by expressing the wavefunction @xmath39 as a linear combination of layer bloch sums @xcite .",
    "a layer bloch sum is a linear superposition of orbitals on all similar atoms associated with a single lattice layer . denoting the layer bloch sum corresponding to orbital @xmath34 with spin @xmath35 on atom @xmath36 in layer @xmath40 as @xmath41 , we have @xmath42 where the symbol @xmath43 denotes a summation over @xmath44 lattice sites ( indexed by @xmath45 ) , within a parallelogram with sides along @xmath46 .",

    "following @xcite , ( [ eq_schrodingermatrixprimitive ] ) is said to be @xmath65-palindromic , since @xmath66 $ ] is hermitian and @xmath67^{\\dagger } = [ h_{s - p , s } ] = [ h_{s , s+p}]$ ] ; the @xmath68 refers to conjugate transpose .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath69 thus occur in reciprocal conjugate pairs , i.e. if @xmath69 is an eigenvalue , then @xmath70 is also an eigenvalue .",
    "hence , the component of @xmath0 along the transport direction , @xmath71 , appears in conjugate pairs @xmath72 .",
    "equation ( [ eq_schrodingermatrixprimitive ] ) can be solved for @xmath71 by recasting it as a generalized linear eigenvalue problem involving matrices of size @xmath73 .",
    "the number of terms and the order @xmath74 of ( [ eq_schrodingermatrixprimitive ] ) depend on @xmath1 . to see this , consider the toy two - dimensional crystal as shown in figure [ fig_twodimensionalcrystal ] .",
    "this crystal has a square lattice and a motif consisting of one @xmath16 and one @xmath18 .",
    "each @xmath16 is bonded to four @xmath18 s and vice versa .",

    "consider the non - primitive unit cell in figure [ fig_twodimensionalcrystal](d ) . since @xmath77 , atoms within the motif bond to atoms belonging only to the same or neighbouring lattice layers .",
    "thus , in the general case , we can ensure that the generalized polynomial eigenvalue problem is restricted to be quadratic , by working with non - primitive vectors @xmath78 .",
    "the volume of the non - primitive unit cell is an integral multiple @xmath79 of that of the primitive cell , causing the the non - primitive brillouin zone to be @xmath80 as large as the primitive one . as an example , @xmath81 in figure [ fig_twodimensionalcrystal](d ) .",
    "we choose the non - primitive unit cell to have the same origin as the primitive cell .",
    "we use upper case roman and greek letters to denote quantities related to the non - primitive scheme .",

    "finally , @xmath71 is computed from @xmath93 using the modified zone unfolding algorithm described below .",
    "it is important to recognize that working with large non - primitive cells could present numerical difficulties in the solution of the generalized quadratic eigenvalue problem .",
    "poor quality eigenvalues and eigenvectors could render the zone unfolding method useless .",
    "this problem is expected to be most severe for eigenvalues corresponding to large @xmath94 , owing to the exponential nature of the factor @xmath95 .",
    "however , the problem is mitigated by the fact that our primary application , modelling of tunneling phenomena , only requires evanescent states having the smallest @xmath94 .",
    "nevertheless , the most important reason for erroneous eigenvalues and eigenvectors is the use of the standard companion linearization scheme @xcite , which neglects the palindromic structure of the gpep ( as shown , for example , in @xcite for the case of vibration analysis of fast trains , involving an eigenvalue problem with similar symmetry ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath69 hence no longer appear as @xmath96 pairs .",
    "the use of a structure preserving linearization @xcite rectifies this issue , and has been shown to greatly improve the quality of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "thus , a careful choice of linearization and eigensolver is critical to the scalability of the method discussed in this paper to large non - primitive cells .",
    "the essential idea in zone unfolding is to express a wavefunction obtained using a non - primitive cell as a linear combination of primitive cell wavefunctions .",
    "the process of unfolding then boils down to estimating the contributions of each of these primitive cell wavefunctions to the non - primitive cell wavefunction . in order to achieve this , both",
    "the non - primitive and primitive wavefunctions are written in terms of their constituent atomic orbitals .      to remain consistent with the zone unfolding algorithm for real bands available in @xcite",
    ", we use a slightly modified version of the layer bloch sums to describe the zone unfolding procedure . working with the non - primitive cell",
    ", we define a primed layer bloch sum @xmath97 , @xmath98 notice that this differs from the non - primary version of the layer bloch sum defined in ( [ eq_layerbloch_definition ] ) only in the absence of the term @xmath99 preceding the atomic orbital . following ( [ eq_psi ] ) , we write @xmath100 where , we have similar to ( [ eq_c ] ) , @xmath101 comparing the two expansions for the wavefunction ( [ eq_psi ] ) , ( [ eq_psiprimed ] ) we can relate the expansion coefficients in the primed basis to those obtained in the unprimed basis as @xmath102    we now attempt to rewrite the expansion ( [ eq_psiprimed ] ) in a way such that the condition ( [ eq_cprimed ] ) is explicitly imposed . for this , we introduce a quantity @xmath103 which is independent of layer @xmath104 , such that @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a normalization constant ( the subscript @xmath107 refers to non - primitive ) . from ( [ eq_layerbloch_definition_primed ] ) , ( [ eq_psiprimed ] ) , ( [ eq_cprimetilde ] ) , we have @xmath108 note that we have explicitly chosen the limits @xmath109 for the sum @xmath110 .",
    "the reason for this will become clear in section [ sec_relationshipbetprimitivenonprimitive ] when we consider the relationship between non - primitive and primitive reciprocal vectors . in short , we wish to ensure that the atoms considered when working with non - primitive or primitive cells are identical .",
    "one can use the fact that @xmath111 and simplify the exponent in ( [ eq_psi:1 ] ) as @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "hence , using ( [ eq_kparallel.kperp : k ] ) to rewrite the double summation in ( [ eq_psi:1 ] ) , @xmath114 ( where @xmath115 refers to the number of non - primitive lattice points ) and dropping the @xmath116 on @xmath117 , we get @xmath118 we have thus been able to rewrite @xmath119 in terms of the full @xmath120 .",
    "provided we have @xmath121 ) is very similar to the one employed in @xcite for the case of real bands , except for the factor of @xmath122 .",
    "indeed , this is the reason that the zone unfolding procedure developed for real bands can be applied to the case of complex bands , albeit with some minor modifications .",
    "we can now write out an expression for the normalization constant @xmath106 so that wavefunction is normalized , i.e. @xmath123 , and @xmath124 .",
    "note that @xmath125 is real ; however @xmath126 can be complex in general . using the orthogonality of the lwdin orbitals , we get @xmath127 note that @xmath128 irrespective of the value of @xmath126 when the energy of the wavefunction corresponds to a real band ( i.e @xmath129 ) . however , @xmath106 depends on @xmath130 in general .",
    "as described in the appendix , the primitive wavefunction is recast similarly as @xmath131 with @xmath132 being a normalization constant .",
    "@xmath133 refers to the number of primitive lattice points .",
    "@xmath134 is related to the expansion coefficients @xmath135 by equations similar to ( [ eq_c_cprimed ] ) , ( [ eq_cprimetilde ] ) .      by construction ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath136 lie to the same side of the plane perpendicular to @xmath1 .",
    "since the lattice points in the non - primitive lattice are a subset of those in the primitive lattice , the ratio @xmath137 is an integer . again , as an example , @xmath138 in figure [ fig_twodimensionalcrystal](d ) . physically , there are @xmath139 primitive lattice layers within a single non - primitive lattice layer .",
    "thus the non - primitive and primitive surface adapted unit cells are commensurate @xcite with each other along @xmath1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the non - primitive and primitive cells are not necessarily commensurate within the plane perpendicular to @xmath1 . since the non - primitive cell is @xmath79 times as large as the primitive cell , @xmath79 primitive reciprocal vectors @xmath140 map onto the same non - primitive reciprocal vector @xmath141 .",
    "using results available in @xcite , we can write @xmath142 where @xmath143 is a vector in the first primitive brillouin zone ( and hence purely real ) that is commensurate with periodic boundary conditions on the non - primitive cell , i.e. @xmath144 note that @xmath145 , @xmath146 , no @xmath147 should be related to any other @xmath148 by a primitive reciprocal lattice vector .    we can now justify the choice of summation limits used for @xmath104 , @xmath149 in ( [ eq_psi:1 ] ) , ( [ eq_psi:1 ] ) respectively .",
    "first , we point out that the layer bloch sums remain invariant upon a shift in atomic position , by a lattice vector in the plane perpendicular to @xmath1 ( i.e. @xmath150 integers @xmath151 , a shift @xmath152 in the case of primitive and @xmath153 in the case of non - primitive layer bloch sums ) .",
    "such a shift merely refers to an identical atom in the motif at a different lattice site .",
    "this invariance arises from the summation over all lattice sites , given that periodic boundary conditions are implied on the boundaries of the parallelogram enclosing the lattice sites .",
    "however , no periodic boundary condition can be applied along @xmath154 when the perpendicular component of the reciprocal vector is complex .",
    "now , let us choose @xmath155 .",
    "then , @xmath156 and @xmath157 ensures that sums in ( [ eq_psi:1 ] ) , ( [ eq_psi:1 ] ) run over the same physical space in the @xmath1 direction ; in fact , one could in general choose @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "further , assume that the primitive motif is such that its atoms are within the unit cell ( for example , as in figure [ fig_twodimensionalcrystal](c ) ) .",
    "then , the sets of atoms considered when working with non - primitive or primitive cells differ in position only by some @xmath153 , which , in the light of the above discussion implies that the atoms are identical .",
    "this is important when we express the non - primitive wavefunction as a linear combination of primitive wavefunctions .",
    "consider a non - primitive wavefunction @xmath160 with energy @xmath2 . using ( [ eq_kkq ] ) , and following @xcite , we express @xmath160 in terms of primitive wavefunctions @xmath161 that have the same energy e. thus , @xmath162 the motif associated with a non - primitive lattice point has @xmath85 atoms .",
    "the primitive motif has @xmath163 atoms .",
    "we introduce @xmath164 , with @xmath165 and @xmath31 to denote the position of the @xmath166 atom of type @xmath36 ( w.r.t the primitive motif ) within the non - primitive motif .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath167 can be designated as @xmath168 .",
    "hence ( [ eq_psi:2 ] ) is modified as @xmath169 further , each non - primitive unit cell will enclose @xmath79 primitive lattice points .",
    "let @xmath170 denote the positions of these primitive lattice points within a non - primitive cell , with respect to the common origin of the primitive and non - primitive cells . in ( [ eq_psi:2 ] )",
    ", one can map the atomic positions @xmath171 to equivalent atomic positions @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( the equivalence as explained previously is established for some integers @xmath175 ) .",
    "figure [ fig_atomremap ] represents the above mapping pictorially using the two - dimensional crystal of figure [ fig_twodimensionalcrystal ] .",
    "the sum @xmath176 can then be replaced by a double sum @xmath177 .",
    "dropping the @xmath116 on @xmath117 , and including ( [ eq_kkq ] ) , we thus get from ( [ eq_psi:2 ] ) , @xmath178 we now substitute ( [ eq_psi : final ] ) and ( [ eq_psi_kq ] ) in ( [ eq_psi_psi ] ) . note that @xmath179 and is independent of @xmath180 , since @xmath143 is purely real .",
    "additionally , @xmath181 from ( [ eq_r ] ) , ( [ eq_q_definition ] ) .",
    "we then compare the coefficients of @xmath182 on both sides of ( [ eq_psi_psi ] ) . rearranging the terms",
