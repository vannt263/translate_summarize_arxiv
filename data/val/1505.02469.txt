    "social influence is ubiquitous in cultural markets . from book recommendations in amazon ,",
    "to song popularities in itunes , and article rankings in the online version of the new york times , social influence has become a critical aspect of the customer experience .",
    "yet there is considerable debate about its benefits and its effects on the market .    in their seminal paper",
    "@xcite , salganik , dodds , and watts argued that social influence makes markets more unpredictable , providing an explanation about why prediction in cultural markets is a wicked problem . to investigate this hypothesis",
    "experimentally , they created an artificial music market called the musiclab .",
    "participants in the musiclab were presented a list of unknown songs from unknown bands , each song being described by its name and band .",
    "the participants were divided into two groups exposed to two different experimental conditions : the _ independent _ condition and the _ social influence _ condition . in the first group ( independent condition ) , participants were provided with no additional information about the songs . each participant would decide which song to listen to from a random list . after listening to a song , the participant had the opportunity to download it . in the second group ( social influence condition ) , each participant was provided with an additional information : the number of times the song was downloaded by earlier participants . moreover ,",
    "these participants were presented with a list ordered by the number of downloads . additionally , to investigate the impact of social influence , participants in the second group were distributed in eight `` worlds '' evolving completely independently .",
    "in particular , participants in one world had no visibility about the downloads and the rankings in the other worlds .",
    "the musiclab is a trial - offer market that provides an experimental testbed for measuring the unpredictability of cultural markets . by observing the evolution of different worlds",
    "given the same initial conditions , the musiclab provides unique insights on the impact of social influence and the resulting unpredictability .",
    "in particular , salganik et al suggested that social influence contributes to both unpredictability and inequality of success , with follow - up experiments confirming these initial findings  @xcite ( see also @xcite for a perspective on the musiclab paper ) .    in recent work @xcite , abeliuk",
    "et al reconsidered the musiclab setting by exploiting the generative model that reproduces the experimental data @xcite .",
    "they showed that social influence always benefits market efficiency , if participants are presented with the optimal ranking , i.e. , the ranking that maximizes the probability of a download at each step .",
    "computational experiments also showed that the optimal ranking significantly outperforms the ranking in which products are displayed by decreasing popularity ( known as popularity ranking ) .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the properties of a simple ranking policy for trial - offer cultural markets : the _ quality ranking _ that simply orders the products by quality .",
    "we show a number of positive results about the quality ranking , including the fact that social influence always benefits market efficiency when it is used and that the benefits of social influence and position bias @xcite are cumulative .",
    "most importantly , we show that , under the quality ranking , the market almost surely converges to a monopoly , assigning the entire market share to the product of highest quality . as a corollary , this implies that the market is optimal asymptotically .",
    "these results are robust and do not depend on specific values for the appeal and quality of the products . moreover ,",
    "computational experiments using the generative model of the musiclab @xcite indicate a fast convergence to the asymptotic predictions : the quality ranking quickly assigns the largest proportion of the market share to the product of highest quality and outperforms other ranking policies . also , there is only minor unpredictability in the market under the quality ranking policy .",
    "our results provide a sharp contrast with the conclusions in @xcite . under the quality ranking policy ,",
    "the market is entirely predictable : it converges to `` blockbusters '' and this convergence is due to social influence . in other words ,",
    "_ it is not social influence that makes markets unpredictable : unpredictability depends on how social influence is used . _",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the benefits of popularity , the social influence signal used in this paper , have been validated experimentally .",
    "indeed , two recent studies @xcite were conducted to understand the relative importance of the different social signals on consumer behaviour .",
    "the first study @xcite surveyed the downloads of more than 500,000 from the android marketplace google play , while the second study @xcite conducted an online experiment ( @xmath0 ) where participants were asked to rank hotels based on the number of reviews and the average rating .",
    "both studies arrived at the same conclusion , namely that the popularity signal ( i.e. , social preference ) has a much stronger impact than the rating signal ( i.e. , a state preference ) .",
    "these two studies provide evidence that quantitative models with popularity as the social signal are of significant importance .",
    "the relationships between quality , popularity , and appeal have also been studied experimentally .",
    "stoddard @xcite studied the relationship between the intrinsic article quality and its popularity in the social news sites reddit and hacker news .",
    "the author proposed a poisson regression model to estimate the demand for an article based upon its quality , past views and age among others .",
    "the results obtained after an estimation of each intrinsic article from these social news site showed that the most popular articles are typically the articles with the highest quality .",
    "another study of social influence was carried out by @xcite .",
    "the authors conducted a field experiment which showed that popularity information may benefit products with narrow appeal significantly more than those with a broad appeal .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : market ] introduces trial - offer markets and section [ section : rankings ] surveys the ranking policies used in this paper .",
    "section [ section - properties ] presents the main properties of the quality ranking , including the benefits of position bias and social influence and the asymptotic convergence .",
    "section [ section : experiments ] describes the computational experiments and section [ section : conclusion ] presents the final discussion .",
    "all the proofs are in the appendix .",
    "this paper considers a trial - offer market in which participants can try a product before deciding to buy it .",
    "such models are now pervasive in online cultural markets ( e.g. , books and songs ) .",
    "the market is composed of @xmath1 products and each product @xmath2 is characterized by two values :    1 .",
    "its _ appeal _ @xmath3 which represents the inherent preference of trying product @xmath4 ; 2 .",
    "its _ quality _ @xmath5 which represents the conditional probability of purchasing product @xmath4 given that it was tried .",
    "each market participant is presented with a product list @xmath6 : she then tries a product @xmath7 in @xmath6 and decides whether to purchase @xmath7 with a certain probability .",
    "the product list is a permutation of @xmath8 and each position @xmath9 in the list is characterized by its _ visibility _",
    "@xmath10 which is the inherent probability of trying a product in position @xmath9 .",
    "since the list @xmath6 is a bijection from positions to products , its inverse is well - defined and is called a ranking .",
    "rankings are denoted by the letter @xmath11 in the following , @xmath12 denotes the product in position @xmath4 of the list @xmath6 , and @xmath13 denotes the position of product @xmath4 in the ranking @xmath11 . hence @xmath14 denotes the visibility of the position of product @xmath4 .",
    "this paper examines a number of questions about these markets , including    * what is the best way to allocate the products to positions ? *",
    "is it beneficial to display a social signal , e.g. , the number of past purchases , to customers ?",
    "* is the market predictable ?",
    "the primary objective is to maximize the market efficiency , i.e. , the expected number of purchases .",
    "note also that the higher this objective is , the lower the probability that consumers try a product but then decide not to purchase it .",
    "thus , if we interpret this last action as an inefficiency , maximising the expected efficiency of the market also minimizes unproductive trials .",
    "[ [ static - market ] ] static market + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in a static market , the probability of trying product @xmath4 given a list @xmath11 is @xmath15 and the static market optimization problem consists of finding a ranking @xmath11 maximizing the expected number of purchases , i.e. ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 represents the symmetry group over @xmath8 .",
    "observe that consumer choice preferences for trying the products are essentially modelled as a discrete choice model based on a multinomial logit @xcite in which product utilities are affected by their position .",
    "abeliuk et al .",
    "@xcite studied a generalization of the maximization problem where it is not required to show all products to consumers .",
    "the authors interpreted the problem as a optimal assortment problem with position - bias and they proved that it can be solved in polynomial time .",

    "given a social signal @xmath18 , the appeal of product @xmath4 becomes @xmath19 and the probability of trying product @xmath4 given a list @xmath11 becomes @xmath20 the dynamic market uses the number of purchases @xmath21 of product @xmath4 at a time @xmath22 as the social signal .",
    "hence , in a dynamic market with @xmath23 steps , the expected number of purchases is defined by the following recurrence :    & u_t(d ) = _ s_n _ i=1^n p_i(,d ) ( q_i ( 1 + u_t+1(d[d_i d_i + 1 ] ) ) + ( 1 - q_i ) u_t+1(d ) ) & ( t 1 .. t ) + & u_t+1(d ) = 0 &    where @xmath24 $ ] represents the vector @xmath25 where element @xmath4 has been replaced by @xmath26 .",
    "the value @xmath27 denotes the optimal expected profit over the time horizon .",
    "observe that the probability of trying a product depends on its position in the list , its appeal , and its number of purchases at time @xmath22 .",
    "as the market evolves over time , the number of purchases dominates the appeal of the product and the trying probability of a product becomes its market share .",
    "note also that a dynamic market with no social influence simply amounts to solving the static market optimization problem repeatedly .",
    "this is called the _ independent condition _ in the rest of the paper .    in the following , without loss of generality , we assume that the qualities and visibilities are non - increasing , i.e. , @xmath28 and @xmath29 we also assume that the qualities and visibilities are known . in practical situations , the product qualities are obviously unknown . however , the quality of the products can be recovered accurately and quickly , either before or during the market execution @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath30 to denote the appeal of product @xmath4 under social influence at step @xmath22 .",
    "when the step @xmath22 is not relevant , we omit it and use @xmath31 instead for simplicity . finally , also for simplicity , we sometimes omit the range of indices in aggregate operators when they range over the products .",
    "this paper focuses on the _ quality ranking _ which simply orders the products by quality , assigning the product of highest quality to the most visible position and so on . in other words , with the above assumptions , a quality ranking @xmath11 satisfies @xmath32 .    the quality ranking contrasts with the _ popularity ranking _ which was used in @xcite to show the unpredictability caused by social influence in cultural markets .",
    "at iteration @xmath33 , the popularity ranking orders the products by the number of purchases @xmath34 . note that purchases do not necessarily reflect the inherent quality of the products , since they depend on how many times the products were tried .",
    "the _ performance ranking _ was proposed in @xcite to show the benefits of social influence in cultural markets .",
    "the performance ranking maximizes the expected number of purchases at each iteration , exploiting all the available information globally , i.e. , the appeal , the visibility , the purchases , and the quality of the products .",
    "more precisely , the performance ranking at step @xmath33 produces a list @xmath35 defined as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the social influence signal at step @xmath33 . the performance ranking uses the probability @xmath38 of trying products @xmath4 at iteration @xmath33 given ranking @xmath11 , as well as the quality @xmath5 of product @xmath4 .",
    "the performance ranking can be computed in strongly polynomial time and the resulting policy is scalable to large markets @xcite .    in the rest of this paper ,",
    "q - rank , d - rank , and p - rank denote the policies using the quality , popularity , and performance rankings respectively .",
    "the policies are also annotated with si or in to denote whether they are used under the social influence or the independent condition .",
    "for instance , p - rank(si ) denotes the policy that uses the performance ranking under the social influence condition , while p - rank(in ) denotes the policy using the performance ranking under the independent condition .",
    "we also use rand - rank to denote the policy that simply presents a random order at each period .    under the independent condition ,",
    "the optimization problem is the same at each iteration as mentioned earlier .",
    "since the performance ranking maximizes the expected purchases at each iteration , it dominates all other policies under the independent condition .",

    "this paper studied trial - offer cultural markets , which are ubiquitous in our societies and involve products such as books , songs , videos , clothes , and even newspaper articles . in these markets ,",
    "participants are presented with products in a certain ranking .",
    "they can then try the products before deciding whether to purchase them .",
    "social influence signals are widely used in such settings and help promote popular products to maximize market efficiency .",
    "however , it has been argued that social influence makes these markets unpredictable @xcite . as a result",
    ", social influence is often presented in a negative light .    in this paper",
    ", we have reconsidered this conventional wisdom .",
    "we have shown that , when products are presented to participants in a way that reflects quality , the market is both efficient and predictable .",
    "in particular , a quality ranking tends to a monopoly for the product of highest quality , making the market both optimal and predictable asymptotically .",
    "moreover , we have also shown that both social influence and position bias improve market efficiency .",
    "these results are robust and do not depend on the particular values for the appeal and quality of the products .",
    "in addition , computational experiments using the generative model of the musiclab show that there is a fast convergence to our asymptotic theoretical results about the performance and the predictability of the quality ranking .",
    "these results are in sharp contrast with the popularity ranking studied in @xcite , where the products are ranked by the strength of the social influence signals . in these conditions ,",
    "the market is indeed unpredictable and less efficient .",
    "there are some important lessons to draw from these results .",
    "* it appears that _ unpredictability is not an inherent property of social influence _ : whether a market is predictable or not really depends on how social influence is used .",
    "* with the quality ranking , it is not hard to predict popularity as the market will converge to a monopoly .",
    "the computational experiments also show that `` blockbusters '' are quickly identified , even when the appeal is negatively correlated with quality .",
    "* whenever the quality of the products can be approximated easily ( e.g. , by running some experiments with a small number of participants or learning it on the fly as suggested in @xcite ) , the quality ranking is the policy of choice : it is predictable and optimal asymptotically and is comparable , or outperforms , the performance ranking , i.e. , greedy policy that continuously optimizes the ranking based on the appeal , the quality , and the social influence signal of each product . * with the quality ranking , a high - quality product overcomes a poor appeal but the opposite does not hold .",
    "a product of poor or average quality never become popular even with a great appeal . obviously , aligning appeal and quality makes the market more efficient but it does not change the asymptotic outcome .",
    "it is also interesting to contrast our results with the study in @xcite which uses a different model for consumer choice preferences . in their model ,",
    "the probability to purchase a product is given by @xmath186 where @xmath187 is a constant and @xmath188 denotes the market share of product @xmath4 . with this choice model , with @xmath187 is large , monopoly occurs and _  eventually any of the products can get the largest market share , so the number of equilibria is @xmath1 _",
    "this comes from the fact that the social influence signal is much stronger in this model , illustrating again that it is how social influence is used , not social influence per se , which makes markets unpredictable and less efficient . in other words ,",
    "the popularity ranking reinforces the social signal too much while , in the model from @xcite , the social signal may be too strong .",
    "recall also that the choice model used in this paper was shown to reproduce the original experiments of the musiclab @xcite .",
    "overall , these results paint a very different picture of the benefits and weaknesses of social influence . social influence does not make the market unpredictable : when used with the quality ranking",
    ", it creates a predictable market for our trial - offer model .",
    "our current goal is to obtain a broader understanding of social influence by generalizing these results to different types of markets ( e.g. , markets with heterogeneous customers ) and different types of social signals .",
