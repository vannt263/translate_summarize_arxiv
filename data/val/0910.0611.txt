    "observational data indicates that our universe is currently under accelerating expansion [ 1 ] .",
    "it seems that some unknown energy components ( dark energy ) with negative pressure are responsible for this late - time acceleration [ 2 ] .",
    "however , understanding the nature of dark energy is one of the fundamental problems of modern theoretical cosmology [ 3 ] .",
    "an alternative approach to accommodate dark energy is modifying the general theory of relativity on large scales . among these theories , scalar - tensor theories [ 4 ] , @xmath0 gravity [ 5 ] , dgp braneworld gravity [ 6 ] and string - inspired theories",
    "[ 7 ] are studied extensively .",
    "one interesting model of modified gravity is the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model , in which our universe is a @xmath1-dimensional brane embedded in an infinite minkowski bulk .",
    "this model has a very appealing phenomenology because it predicts that @xmath2d newtonian gravity on the brane is recovered at distances shorter than a given crossover distance @xmath3 , whereas at scale higher than @xmath3 the @xmath4d effects become important due to leakage of gravity into the bulk . on the other hand , this model can explain the late - time acceleration of the universe in its self - accelerating branch without need to introducing a dark energy term [ 8 ] .",
    "unfortunately , this branch suffers from some instabilities such as appearance of ghost degrees of freedom [ 9 ] .",
    "an alternative class of modified gravity models is the family of the string - inspired gravities by considering additional curvature invariant terms such as the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term [ 10 ] .",
    "gb term arises naturally as the leading order of the @xmath5 expansion of the heterotic string theory where , @xmath5 is the inverse string tension [ 11 ] .",
    "et al _ [ 12 ] showed that a particular dark energy solution can be obtained from scalar - gauss - bonnet cosmology .",
    "there is another version of the gauss - bonnet gravity namely the modified gb or @xmath6 theory [ 13 ] that can also play the role of gravitational dark energy .",
    "one of the essential tools for understanding the nature of dark energy is to detect the evolution of its equation of state parameter @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are pressure and energy density of dark energy component respectively .",
    "recent analysis on the data from the supernova , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and large scale structure ( lss ) show that the cosmological constant fits well to the data [ 14 ] , however current data also mildly favor an evolving dark energy with an equation of state @xmath10 larger than @xmath11 in the past and less than @xmath11 today [ 15 ] with evolution across @xmath12 line in the intermediate redshift .",
    "if such a result holds on with a large number of the observational data , this would be a great challenge to the current models of dark energy .",
    "firstly , the cosmological constant [ 16 ] as a candidate for dark energy will be excluded and dark energy must be dynamical ( note also that the cosmological constant needs a huge amount of fine - tuning ) .",
    "secondly , the case with @xmath10 less than @xmath11 which is often dubbed as phantom dark energy [ 17 ] introduces new theoretical facilities and challenges in this field .",
    "phantom fields are a sort of scalar fields with negative sign for the kinetic energy term .",
    "in fact , phantom fields suffer from instabilities due to violation of the null energy condition , and a phantom universe eventually ends up with a big rip singularity [ 18 ] . thus it seems natural to seek alternative approaches to realize a phantom - like behavior without introducing any phantom field in the model .",
    "phantom - like behavior is the growth of the effective dark energy density with cosmic time and in the same time , the effective equation of state parameter should stay always less than @xmath11 . in this regard , it has been shown that the normal , non - self - accelerating branch of the dgp scenario has the potential to explain phantom - like behavior without introducing any phantom fields on the brane ( for a number of attempts in this direction see [ 19 ] ) .",
    "the phantom - like behavior of @xmath2-dimensional @xmath0 gravity is studied in [ 20 ] .    with these preliminaries ,",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct a class of dgp - inspired braneworld scenarios that curvature corrections are taken into account via incorporation of a gauss - bonnet type invariant term in the brane part of the action .",
    "actually , the gauss - bonnet invariant should be considered in the bulk action . however , our goal here is to consider possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane by incorporation of higher order curvature terms such as the gauss - bonnet type terms .",
    "in fact , since gauss - bonnet term is an invariant in @xmath2-dimensions , it takes contribution in the field equations if there is a coupling between scalar degrees of freedom on the brane and this invariant term .",
    "this is the main reason for incorporation of the @xmath13 field in @xmath14 . in the previous works done by other authors in this subject , generally an effective phantom phase is realized by adopting a phantom ansatz for scale factor . here",
    "as we will show , the phantom phase is realized on the normal branch of the dgp - inspired model with curvature correction on the brane .",
    "we note also that generally one can show , by re - construction method , that @xmath0 gravity is equivalent to general relativity plus the scalar field [ 20 ] .",
    "we investigate the effect of higher order induced curvature correction in two alternative approaches : scalar - gauss - bonnet gravity with @xmath15 term in the brane action and modified gauss - bonnet gravity with @xmath16 term that @xmath17 is the gauss - bonnet invariant .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath18 we start from the action of the dgp - inspired @xmath15 scenario and derive the corresponding field equations .",
    "then , we study the cosmological implications of this model .",
    "we show that in the presence of the curvature correction due to a scalar - gauss - bonnet term in the action , the normal branch of the scenario has a self - accelerating behavior .",
    "the expansion history of this model will be studied and a comparison between luminosity distances in this model , the @xmath19dgp and @xmath19cdm will be performed . on the other hand , in this scenario we obtain a phantom - like behavior without introducing a phantom field neither in the bulk nor on the brane . in section @xmath20",
    "we consider a modified gauss - bonnet gravity in the dgp braneworld and we obtain the cosmological equations of the scenario . we show that this scenario can also realize a phantom - like behavior by adopting viable ansatz for the scale factor in the appropriate subspaces of the model parameter space .",

    "it is important to note that in the matter action , the matter is minimally coupled to the metric and not to the scalar field , making the gauss - bonnet gravity a metric theory which leads to conservation of matter on the brane . note also that we have incorporated possible modification of the induced gravity on the brane by inclusion of the higher order induced curvature terms via the gauss - bonnet invariant .",

    "plays the role of a negative pressure fluids that accelerates the universe expansion . equation ( 23 ) as the modified friedmann equation in this dgp - inspired @xmath15 scenario is similar to the standard induced gravity result , but we note that here there is an important difference which is hidden in the definition of the total energy density and pressure on the brane .",
