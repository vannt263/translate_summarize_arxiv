    "first detected in an infrared survey of the l1551 cloud ( strom , strom , & vrba 1976 ) , l1551  irs5 is a prototypical young stellar system , with a strong bipolar molecular outflow ( snell , loren , & plambeck 1980 ) , an optical jet ( mundt & fried 1983 ) , hh objects ( herbig 1974 ) , and an envelope - disk structure in the surrounding material ( keene & masson 1990 ) . located at a distance of 140 pc ( elias 1978 ) and exhibiting a luminosity of @xmath4 ( butner   1991 ) , l1551  irs5 was one of the defining examples for class i sources in the classification scheme of adams , lada , and shu ( 1987 ) and has been used as an archetype in the current paradigm for single - star formation ( shu  1993 ) .",
    "but is it really a single - star system ?",
    "high resolution @xmath0  =  2  cm continuum observations of l1551  irs5 show two compact sources with a separation of @xmath5 ( bieging & cohen 1985 ; rodrguez  1986 ) which have been interpreted as either a protobinary system ( bieging & cohen 1985 ) , or the inner ionized edges of a gas and dust toroid surrounding a single star ( rodrguez  1986 ) .",
    "the latter is the most widely accepted interpretation , but comparisons with @xmath0  =  2  cm emission from other young binary systems such as t tau and z cma ( bieging , cohen , & schwartz 1984 ; schwartz , simon , & zuckerman 1983 ) , suggest that the binary interpretation is also viable .    under the assumption that l1551  irs5 is a single star system , keene and masson ( 1990 ) modeled @xmath0  =  2.7  mm interferometric observations to deduce the presence of a 45  au radius circumstellar disk within an envelope .",
    "this envelope , which extends out @xmath21000  au from irs5 , contains 0.1 to 1 m   of material ( ladd  1995 ; fuller  1995 ) .",
    "high resolution jcmt - cso interferometric observations at @xmath0  =  870  @xmath6",
    "m resolved the compact central emission ( lay  1994 ) , and the emission was modeled as arising from an 80  au radius gaussian source , inferred to be an accretion disk around the young star .    in this letter , we present sub - arcsecond imaging of the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm continuum emission from the l1551  irs5 system .",
    "these observations re - open questions about the binarity of the system and the distribution of the surrounding material .",
    "l1551  irs5 was observed in three array configurations of the 9-element bima array ( welch  1996 ) .",
    "the longest baselines were 1  km n - s and 900 m e - w , yielding a maximum projected baseline of 480  k@xmath0 ( 1.4 km ) ; the shortest baselines were limited by the antenna size of 6.1  m , yielding a minimum projected baseline of 2.2  k@xmath0 .",
    "this range in projected baselines provides images with a minimum resolution of 0@xmath73 , fully sampled to sizes as large as 60@xmath8 .    for the high resolution configuration ( march 1 , 1996 ) ,",
    "atmospheric phase fluctuations were tracked by switching the antennas between source , phase calibrator , and a nearby weak quasar on a two minute cycle .",
    "the usefulness of this quick switching technique has been demonstrated at the vla ( holdaway & owen 1995 ) . the main phase calibrator ( 0530 + 135 ) was used to track rapid atmospheric phase fluctuations .",
    "the secondary quasar ( 0449 + 113 ) was used to track slow phase drifts due to the difference in airmass between the primary calibrator and source and , more importantly for this array , phase drifts due to uncertainties in baseline length .",
    "the digital correlator was configured with two 700  mhz bands centered at 107  ghz and 109  ghz .",
    "the flux amplitude calibration assumed a flux of 6.8  jy for 0530 + 135 , as observed in the following month s compact array .",
    "the coherence of the atmosphere was checked on the quasars ; the uncertainty in the amplitude calibration is 20% .",
    "absolute positions in our map have uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the antenna baselines and the statistical uncertainty from the signal - to - noise of the observation .",
    "these two factors add in quadrature to give an absolute positional uncertainty of @xmath114 .",
    "the lower resolution data ( acquired on october 3 , 1996 , february 2 , 1997 , and march 8 , 1997 ) used 0530 + 135 to track phase variations and mars for amplitude calibration .",
    "the l1551  irs5 data were imaged in four ways which stress structures present on different spatial scales .",
    "figure 1 shows four maps : two with robust weightings of the visibilities ( robust  =  0.5 yielding a 3@xmath9 beam and robust  =  -0.25 yielding a 1@xmath10 beam ) , one with natural weighting of only the high resolution a array data restored with the fitted `` clean '' beam ( 0@xmath11 beam ) , and one with the a array data restored with a circular 0@xmath731 `` clean '' beam .",
    "the latter technique strongly emphasizes the high resolution information present in the a array _",
    "u , v _ data . with maximum projected baselines ranging from 320  k@xmath0 to 480  k@xmath0 , the smallest fringe spacings in our dataset ranges from 0@xmath764 to 0@xmath744",
    "; hence information down to size scales of 0@xmath72 to 0@xmath73 is present in the _ u , v _ data .",
    "high resolution maps of the secondary quasar 0449 + 113 , using the standard technique and using the 0@xmath731 `` clean '' beam , were consistent with a point source .",
    "figure 1a ( 3@xmath8 resolution ) has a peak flux of 122@xmath123  mjy  beam@xmath13 , and the integrated flux in a 8@xmath8 box centered on the source is 162@xmath126  mjy .",
    "a gaussian fit to the image gives a deconvolved gaussian source size of 1@xmath14 and pa=68@xmath15 .",
    "figure 1b ( 1@xmath8 resolution ) has a peak flux of 78@xmath123  mjy  beam@xmath13 , and the integrated flux in a 3@xmath8 box centered on the source is 143@xmath1210  mjy .",
    "a gaussian fit to the image gives a deconvolved gaussian source size of 0@xmath16 and pa=157@xmath15 .",
    "figure 1c shows the map of the a array data alone restored with the gaussian fitted clean beam .",
    "the peak flux in the map is 45@xmath125 mjy beam@xmath13 , and the integrated flux in a 1@xmath73 box centered on the source is 75@xmath1211  mjy .",
    "although it is not obvious in figure 1c , over @xmath17 of the flux present in the lowest resolution map is now gone and the peak flux is roughly @xmath18 of that in figure 1a . despite the elongated `` clean '' beam , the remaining emission is clearly extended north - south in the cleaned image ; a gaussian fit to the image gives a deconvolved gaussian source size of 0@xmath1932 and pa=@xmath20 .",
    "figure 1d shows the a array data restored with the circular @xmath21 beam .",
    "the north - south extension is obvious in this map and there is no hint of east - west extension .",
    "the peak flux is 38 mjy beam@xmath13 corresponding to a brightness temperature of 41  k.    the images in figure 1a and 1b emphasize the overall emission from the l1551 system .",
    "the reconstructions in figure 1c and figure 1d highlight the small scale emission which is more compact than expected for the disk size estimates of keene and masson ( 1990 ) and lay  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the compact emission is consistent with arising from two point sources , as seen at @xmath0  =  2  cm and @xmath0  =  1.3  cm ( rodrguez  1986 ; koerner & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "a two gaussian fit to the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm emission in figure 1d yields the following positions hereafter labeled irs5  a and irs5  b : irs5  a :  @xmath22(j2000 ) = @xmath23 , @xmath24(j2000 ) = @xmath25 and irs5  b :  @xmath22(j2000 ) = @xmath26 , @xmath24(j2000 ) = @xmath27 .",
    "these positions agree to within 0@xmath705 with the @xmath0  =  1.3  cm source positions of koerner and sargent ( 1997 ) .",
    "the separation of the two sources is 0@xmath735 , corresponding to 49 au .",
    "both sources have deconvolved sizes of @xmath28 .",
    "a two point source fit yields flux densities of 45@xmath126 mjy for irs5  a and 23@xmath126 mjy for irs5  b. the total flux density in the compact sources is then 68@xmath129 mjy .",
    "high resolution centimeter wavelength images of l1551  irs5 show two point - like sources and an extended jet ( bieging & cohen 1985 ) .",
    "the jet is detected only at long centimeter wavelengths ; the two point sources dominate the flux at shorter wavelengths .",
    "the @xmath0  =  2  cm flux densities are 1.2 mjy for irs5  a and 0.93 mjy for irs5  b ( rodrguez  1986 ) .",
    "recent vla observations also resolved the two sources at @xmath0  =  1.3  cm ( koerner & sargent 1997 ) and yielded flux densities of 2.0@xmath120.2  mjy and 1.5@xmath120.2  mjy , respectively .",
    "the spectral indices between @xmath0  =  2.0 and 1.3  cm are then @xmath291.25 and @xmath301.04 , consistent with @xmath311 estimated by bieging and cohen ( 1985 ) . extrapolating to 109 ghz",
    ", this emission could contribute as much as @xmath214.4  mjy and @xmath27.8  mjy , respectively , to the observed fluxes .",
    "hence , the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm flux is dominated by dust emission .",
    "the proposal of rodrguez  ( 1986 ) that the @xmath0  =  2  cm emission traces the ionized inner edge of a larger dusty torus is not consistent with the observed compact @xmath0  =  2.7  mm emission .",
    "since the millimeter emission directly probes the dust , we should easily see the torus in our high resolution maps . if there were a torus , the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm emission would extend beyond the @xmath0  =  2  cm sources and , in fact , peak outside of them .",
    "the binary interpretation of bieging & cohen is consistent with our image if the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm emission arises from circumstellar disks within the binary system , while the @xmath0  =  2  cm emission traces ionized gas associated with stellar winds or jets .",
    "combining all observations to date , the l1551  irs5 system consists of three main circumstellar components : a large - scale envelope ( keene and masson 1990 ; ladd  1995 ) , a disk or extended structure with a size scale of @xmath21  ( lay  1994 ; keene and masson 1990 ) , and an inner binary system as argued in section 4 .",
    "how do these components fit together ? to answer this question ,    we compare our _ u , v _ data binned in annuli with simulated observations of models for the system , binned similarly . in the following subsections we discuss each component and derive characteristic masses .",
    "figure 2a compares our _ u , v _ data with the gaussian model from lay  ( 1994 ) scaled to match the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm flux at 50  k@xmath0 . above 100  k@xmath0 ,",
    "the gaussian model is resolved out and does not fit the data ; below 20  k@xmath0 the data diverge from the model due to flux from the envelope .",
    "figure 2b shows a two point source model with the separation and amplitudes given in section 3 .",
    "the two point sources beat together to cause the variations in flux seen past 100k@xmath0 .",
    "the proposed binary disk system is evident only in our data ; its separation is too small to be resolved in the data of lay  ( 1994 ) or keene and masson ( 1990 ) .",
    "in fact , due to the small angular size and the embedded nature of the binary system , the properties of the proposed disks are poorly constrained by observations to date .",
    "the projected separation and extent of the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm emission suggests a maximum outer radius of 25 au for the disks . to estimate the masses of the disks , we assume a standard power - law disk with parameters characteristic of the hl  tau disk , t@xmath32 and @xmath33 ( mundy  1996 ; beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . for dust properties ,",
    "we adopt @xmath34=0.1@xmath35 @xmath36  g@xmath13 , which is consistent with other recent works ( e.g. osterloh and beckwith 1995 ; ohashi  1991 ; beckwith & sargent 1991 ) . with these assumptions ,",
    "the disk masses are m@xmath370.024  m@xmath3 and m@xmath380.009  m@xmath3 .",
    "the excess emission in our robust weighted maps ( figures 1a and 1b ) compared to our highest resolution map ( figure 1d ) and the rise in flux on baselines shorter than 15 k@xmath0 ( figure 2 ) , are due primarily to the extended envelope .",
    "our flux densities in the larger beams are consistent with previous measurements at similar resolutions : keene and masson ( 1990 ) find a peak flux of 130 mjy beam@xmath13 at @xmath0  =  2.73  mm in a 2@xmath76 beam and a total flux of 150 mjy ; ohashi   ( 1996 ) measure a total flux of 160 mjy at @xmath0  =  2.73  mm using a 4@xmath75 beam .",
    "our _ u , v _ data in figure 2 and figure 2 of keene and masson ( 1990 ) , show similar fluxes around 10  k@xmath0 , but our data has 20% to 30% less flux from 40  k@xmath0 to 70  k@xmath0 .",
    "these differences are within the calibration uncertainties .    the differences in flux densities at different resolutions , or equivalently the drop in flux density with _",
    "u , v _ distance , can be used to estimate the properties of the envelope .",
    "our data are broadly consistent with the envelope parameters determined by ladd ( 1995 ) and fuller ( 1995 ) . fitting the drop in flux between 2.6  k@xmath0 and 15  k@xmath0 with a power - law envelope model ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) combined with the two point source model from section 5.1 ,",
    "reasonable results are obtained for an envelope mass of @xmath20.44 m@xmath3 , an outer radius of @xmath21300 au , and an inner envelope radius of 30 au ( figure 2c ) . steeper envelope density laws ( @xmath41 )",
    "also fit the data with a characteristic mass and outer radius of 0.43  m@xmath3 and 1800  au , respectively .",
    "finally , an intermediate - sized structure , perhaps a circumbinary disk such as seen around gg  tau ( dutrey , guilloteau , simon 1994 ) or a `` pseudo - disk '' ( galli and shu 1993 ) , is needed to account for the structure resolved by lay  ( 1994 ) and the compact structure deduced by keene and masson ( 1990 ) . in our data ,",
    "this structure is evident as the excess emission between 30  k@xmath0 and 90  k@xmath0 in figure 2c .",
    "as shown in figure 2d , this excess can be fitted with a gaussian model consistent with that of lay  ( 1@xmath72  @xmath42  0@xmath77",
    "pa  =  160@xmath15 ) with a flux of 30 mjy plus an envelope model with a mass of 0.28  m@xmath3 ( @xmath39 ) and a radius of 1100  au .",
    "the parameters of the envelope and the circumbinary structure are interdependent and hence only crudely determined .",
    "if the circumbinary structure has dust properties similar to the envelope parameters in section 5.2 , the circumbinary structure has a rough mass of 0.04  m@xmath3 .    to test the consistency of the above model with the lay  ( 1994 ) data , we fit two different source structures to their @xmath0  =  870  @xmath6 m data : a single elliptical gaussian ( a single circumstellar disk ) and a single elliptical gaussian with two central point sources ( a circumbinary disk with two small circumstellar disks ) , following the fitting procedure of lay  ( 1994 ; also see lay 1994 ) .",
    "the model did not include envelope emission since the jcmt - cso baselines ranged from 50  k@xmath0 to 200  k@xmath0 , where the envelope emission is completely resolved out .",
    "the single elliptical gaussian model fits the @xmath0  =  870  @xmath6 m data very well , with parameters comparable to those found by lay  ( 1994 ) .",
    "the addition of two point sources to the single gaussian model produces as good a fit as the single gaussian model , but the fwhm of the gaussian increases slightly .",
    "hence , the data can not distinguish between the single gaussian and single gaussian with point source models .",
    "if the circumbinary material is optically thick at @xmath0  =  870  @xmath6 m , the lay  data would not even see the embedded circumstellar disks . if the circumbinary material is not optically thick , the lay data place a limit on the flux from the circumstellar disks : at a 95% confidence level the circumstellar disks emit @xmath43  1.3  jy at @xmath0  =  870  @xmath6 m .",
    "our data present the first direct detection of a close , embedded binary system . proposed wider binary systems have been identified among embedded sources , e.g. iras 16293 - 2422 ( wootten 1989 ) , ngc  1333  iras4 ( sandell  1991 ; lay  1995 ) , and l1527 ( fuller , ladd , & hodapp 1996 ) , but the number of such systems is actually quite small compared to the number of known embedded sources .",
    "surveys of pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars find that binary systems are at least as common among young visible stars as among main - sequence stars ( simon  1992 ; ghez , neugebauer & matthews 1993 ; leinert  1993 ; reipurth & zinnecker 1993 ) ; so binaries should be common among young , deeply embedded systems . that they have not often been seen is probably due to the lack of sub - arcsecond resolution observations which are necessary to resolve close binaries .",
    "the separation of the l1551  irs5 system is near the median separation for main sequence binaries ( @xmath230  au , duquennoy & mayor 1991 ) .",
    "the low detection rate of wide embedded binaries is in rough agreement with the fraction of main sequence binaries with separations between 300 and several 1000 au .",
    "l1551  irs5 also ranks as one of the few close binary systems with significant dust emission associated with both components .",
    "submillimeter wavelength surveys have generally found lesser amounts of dust emission associated with pms binary systems than with young single stars systems ( simon  1992 , 1995 ) . in a statistical comparison of binaries and single stars ,",
    "jensen , mathieu & fuller ( 1996 ) found that binaries with separations @xmath44 50 - 100 au statistically have lower submillimeter fluxes than wider binaries , but wide binaries are indistinguishable from single stars ; hence , the l1551  irs5 system may be unusual .",
    "however , these studies concentrate on t tauri stars and exclude the youngest sources , class i or younger .",
    "it is possible that embedded close binaries , which are still accreting mass , have substantial circumstellar or circumbinary disks which disappear later when the envelope is no longer feeding - in material .",
    "sub - arcsecond @xmath0  =  2.7  mm observations of l1551  irs5 have resolved a compact central structure , which is most plausibly interpreted as a young binary system .",
    "the @xmath0  =  2.7  mm continuum emission shows two peaks which are similar , in absolute position and separation , to the free - free emission observed at centimeter wavelengths .",
    "our interpretation is that we are detecting thermal dust emission from small disks around the individual stars in a binary system and that the centimeter emission arises in the associated stellar winds .",
    "we propose that the l1551  irs5 system is composed of two circumstellar disks , located inside a circumbinary structure , embedded in a large - scale envelope .",
    "simple modeling yields masses for these components : circumstellar disk masses of 0.024  m@xmath3 and 0.009  m@xmath3 for the northern and southern sources respectively , a circumbinary structure mass of 0.04  m@xmath3 , and an envelope mass of 0.28  m@xmath3 .",
    "the binary separation for l1551  irs5 is about 50 au , close to the median separation for main sequence binaries .",
    "the small number of young embedded binaries detected to date , probably reflects the inadequate angular resolution available in the earlier studies , rather than an intrinsic sparsity of binaries .",
    "we thank the hat creek staff for their efforts in the construction and operation of the long baselines array .",
    "we also thank the referee , jocelyn keene , and oliver lay for their comments .",
