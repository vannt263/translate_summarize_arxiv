    "in a quantum spin system , the spin order of the classical ground state can be melted by a quantum fluctuation at zero temperature @xcite , and the resulting so - called quantum spin liquid has been suggested as a possible parent state of high temperature superconductivity upon electron or hole doping @xcite .",
    "the quantum fluctuation is usually enhanced with small spin , low dimensionality , and geometric frustration .",
    "indeed , so far almost all the candidates of quantum spin liquid discovered or proposed are effective spin-1/2 systems with or without charge fluctuations on triangular lattice @xcite , on kagome lattice zncu1,zncu2,bacu , cuv , huse2010 , or on honeycomb lattice wangfa2010,sondhi2011,lauchli2011,reuther2011,meng2010 .",
    "besides the exotic quantum spin liquid phases , strong quantum fluctuations in spin-1/2 systems can also lead to highly unconventional quantum critical points .",
    "for example , it has been proposed that a generic direct second order quantum phase transition between a magnetic ordered phase and a paramagnetic phase with broken lattice symmetry can exist in spin-1/2 quantum magnets senthil2004a , senthil2004b .",
    "such a transition is forbidden by the classic landau - ginzburg - wilson - fisher paradigm , and is called the deconfined quantum critical point , as it is described by fractionalized quantities instead of physical order parameters . in the last few years",
    "this theoretical proposal has gained strong numerical evidence by quantum monte carlo simulation on spin-1/2 models with both nearest neighbor heisenberg coupling and four - spin interactions @xcite .    in this paper we will address the question :",
    "can quantum fluctuation lead to such exotic phases and phase transitions in systems with larger spins in two dimensions without geometric frustration ?",
    "theoretically , this question is highly nontrivial as the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki type of valence bond state ( vbs ) only exists for spin-1 systems in one dimension .",
    "recent experiments on the spin-1 magnet ba@xmath0nisb@xmath1o@xmath2 suggested that a highly nontrivial quantum disordered ground state of a two dimensional spin-1 system is indeed possible @xcite .    by using the state of the art tensor renormalization group method jiang08,zhao10,vidal07 , we present strong numerical evidences for the quantum fluctuation driven exotic physics in the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice . an interesting but surprising result",
    "we find is that all dipole and quadruple magnetic orders vanish in a phase where the ground state is staggered quadrupolar ordered in the classical limit , instead the system develops a translation symmetry breaking plaquette order .",
    "moreover , we demonstrate that the transition between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic af order is either a direct second order transition or a very weak first order transition . if it is indeed a direct second order transition , then it is most likely a deconfined quantum critical point , which is the first example of deconfined quantum critical point in spin-1 system .",

    "due to the critical point between af and plaquette order at @xmath70 , our numerical result also implies that the ground state of the su(3 ) af heisenberg model on the honeycomb lattice has a plaquette order .",
    "this result concurs with the recent studies on the su(n ) heisenberg model @xcite , which suggested that the su(n ) spins tend to form block singlets that are commensurate with the lattice .    to summarize , the ground state phase diagram of the quantum spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice has been determined precisely . besides the ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and ferro - quadrupolar phases , a plaquette order phase is found in the region of @xmath71 for the first time , where the classical af or staggered quadrupolar order is completely suppressed by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the quantum phase transition between af and the plaquette order phase is found to be either a direct second order or a very weak first order transition .",
