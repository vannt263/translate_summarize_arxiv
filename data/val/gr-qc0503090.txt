    "condensed - matter systems provide several examples of emerging quantum fields ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "effective gravity appears in the low - energy corner of condensed matter either via the metric @xmath0 or via the vierbeins @xmath1 .",
    "these fields are functions of the coordinates @xmath2 and @xmath3 of the underlying flat galilei or minkowski spacetime , just as the other emerging fields ( e.g. , fermionic and gauge fields )",
    ".    emergent gravity does not require an _ a - priori _ notion of curved spacetime .",
    "the latter is a secondary phenomenon experienced by low - energy quasiparticles , whose dynamics in the geometric - optics limit can be described in terms of motion along the geodesic curves provided by the effective metric @xmath0 . for the ` poor physicist ' of ref",
    "@xcite who can only use quasiparticles with energies low compared to the corresponding cut - off @xmath4 , the world is curved .",
    "the most interesting condensed - matter models have effective gravity emerging together with non - abelian gauge fields and weyl fermions in systems with fermi points ( generic points of level crossing at zero energy ) @xcite . it may well be ( though this has not yet been proven ) that , if the hierarchy of energy scales is favorable , the dynamics of the effective gravity is described by an einstein  hilbert action emerging at low energy . for the ` poor physicist ' living in this particular type of condensed matter , any connection to the ` fundamental ' underlying spacetime is lost and effective gravity is ( at least , locally ) indistinguishable from a fundamental interaction .",
    "these considerations force us to pay more attention to approaches which consider the gravitational field as a conventional non - abelian spin2 field in minkowski spacetime @xcite .",
    "but , even if these theories in the low - energy corner lead to the same local equations as einstein gravity , the global structure of the universe can be different .",
    "the latter can , in principle , be detected by following the particle trajectories @xcite .",
    "moreover , the mere existence of fundamental coordinates suggests that in some cases the so - called coordinate singularities , which appear in certain solutions of the einstein equations , are not gauge artifacts but real physical singularities .",
    "this occurs if the coordinate transformation needed to remove the singularity belongs to a class of transformations forbidden in the global fundamental spacetime .",
    "one example may be provided by a static einstein universe with positive cosmological constant @xmath5 @xcite , whose line element can be written as @xmath6 here , we have used relativistic units so that the velocity of light in `` empty '' space has the value @xmath7 ( later , we also set @xmath8 ) . in the original einstein theory ,",
    "space is the three - dimensional ( 3d ) compact hypersurface of the 4d spacetime @xmath9 .",
    "this einstein universe is geodesically complete and free from singularities , which means that the coordinate singularity at @xmath10 is a gauge artifact caused by the specific choice of coordinates on the compact space @xmath11 .",
    "more precisely , the space described by the metric ( [ einsteinuniverse ] ) for @xmath12 is only one hemisphere of @xmath11 , whereas the whole space of the original einstein universe has @xmath13 for polar angle @xmath14 $ ] ; cf .",

    "let us now consider the universe ( [ einsteinuniverse ] ) from the point of view of gravity as a field determined in minkowski spacetime @xmath15 . since @xmath15 is infinite , the finite einstein universe must be a part of the infinite system .",
    "one option is to replace the coordinate singularity at @xmath10 with a real singularity ( or , better , a physical boundary between two regions ) at @xmath16 .",
    "the einstein universe lies inside the boundary ( interface ) and the rest of minkowski spacetime outside :    [ einsteinbubble ] @xmath17 ds^2&= & -dt^2 + dr^2 + r^2 \\left ( d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta \\,d\\phi^2 \\right)\\ , , \\quad r > r\\ , , \\label{minkowski}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with constants @xmath18 and @xmath19 to be determined later .",
    "observe that this metric describes a static spacetime with an _ inhomogeneous _ spatial section : a universe with constant matter density and cosmological constant @xmath20 inside , and an empty flat space with @xmath21 outside .",
    "in contrast , the original einstein universe has a homogeneous spatial section , @xmath11 being a symmetric space .",
    "indeed , the `` universe '' from eqs .",
    "( [ einsteinbubble]ab ) does have a _ center _",
    "( i.e. , a point with equal distance to the interface in each direction ) , even though this may not be apparent to the ` poor physicist ' living deep inside . for this observer",
    ", the inside region serves as a static einstein universe .",
    "the metric ( [ einsteinuniverse2 ] ) obeys the einstein equations , with matter density @xmath22 , cosmological constant @xmath23 , and horizon radius @xmath19 related by the following equations : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the matter equation of state .",
    "the total energy of the einstein universe including the interface ( @xmath26 ) must be zero .",
    "this then matches the minkowski metric of the outer region ( @xmath27 ) , where matter is absent and the cosmological constant is zero , @xmath28 .",
    "the outer region exerts no pressure on the inner region , which behaves as if there were no external environment .    however ,",
    "the discontinuity of the metric at @xmath29 and the jump in the vacuum energy demonstrate that the singularity is physical .",
    "the jump in vacuum energy requires a surface layer which separates the `` true '' vacuum outside ( @xmath30 for @xmath27 ) from the `` false '' vacuum inside ( @xmath31 for @xmath32 ) . within the surface layer ,",
    "the original theory is modified . in this approach ,",
    "the einstein universe represents a bubble of false vacuum embedded in true vacuum .",
    "note also that the additional pressure from the surface tension and the gravitational effects of the massive boundary modify the balance between the outer and inner vacua .",
    "another example of a false - vacuum bubble is a de - sitter universe @xcite embedded in a space - time which is flat at spatial infinity ,    [ desitterbubble ] @xmath33    with solid angle element @xmath34 , de - sitter length scale @xcite @xmath35 and constants @xmath18 and @xmath36 to be determined later .",
    "note that , historically , weyl @xcite appears to have been the first to try to replace the de - sitter horizon at @xmath10 by a physical surface layer and glue together two static de - sitter universes .",

    "the horizon is again a massive surface layer .",
    "similar junctions between different space - times have been considered for inflation and wormhole models ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in both examples ,",
    "a physical boundary separates two regions with different values of @xmath37 and serves as the interface between two vacua with different values of the vacuum energy .",
    "the problem of coexisting vacua in general relativity and elementary particle physics is rapidly becoming mainstream , not without the influence of condensed - matter physics .",
    "reference @xcite , for example , considers a friedmann - robertson - walker island embedded in a de - sitter spacetime with nonzero cosmological constant . for elementary particle physics ,",
    "the so - called multiple point principle has been introduced @xcite , according to which nature chooses the parameters of the standard model so that two or more phases of quantum vacua have the same energy density and can coexist .",
    "coexistence of quantum vacua has also been discussed in relation to the cosmological constant problem @xcite , where it was found that the equilibrium value of @xmath37 in the exterior region vanishes ( based on an analog from condensed - matter physics and a thermodynamic argument applied to the vacuum of relativistic quantum fields ) .",
    "furthermore , there may exist bubbles of false vacuum , whose stability is provided by the conservation of a fermionic charge @xmath38 trapped within the bubble or on the interface .",
    "these analogs of @xmath38balls @xcite have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "regarding the nature of the fermionic charge @xmath38 , possible examples are the baryon charge @xmath39 , the lepton charge @xmath40 , or the difference @xmath41 , which is exactly conserved in the standard model  whereas @xmath42 is not @xcite .    as a particularly simple case , we discuss in the next section the embedded de - sitter universe and one possible type of interface . in the final section , we present some concluding remarks .",

    "( [ desitterbubble]ab ) using thin - wall techniques ( see @xcite and references therein ) . the interface ( membrane ) at radius @xmath29 could be a topological domain wall between two almost - degenerate vacuum states .",
    "this wall is assumed to be very thin compared to the characteristic size of the universe , @xmath43 , and can be considered as a delta - function singularity in the energy - momentum tensor for the matter fields .",
    "the detailed structure within the domain wall need not be considered , since the general properties of the domain wall can be described in terms of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional energy - momentum tensor of the membrane , which is characterized by two parameters , the surface energy density @xmath44 and the surface tension @xmath45 . in the thin - wall approach",

    "could perhaps be called a @xmath38shell , but we will adhere to the more general terminology of @xmath38ball .",
    "let us first discuss the case @xmath64 .",
    "the universe then occupies only a small fraction of the volume of the cosmological horizon and the effect of gravity is weak and can be ignored . in this limit , we have a non - gravitating false - vacuum bubble without matter .",

    "nullification of the cosmological constant in the exterior region may be a consequence of thermodynamic stability for a system isolated from its environment @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ pressuredesitternong2 ] ) gives the radius of the @xmath38ball in terms of @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath72 , the equilibrium false - vacuum @xmath38ball exists only for negative surface tension , which , according to eq .",
    "( [ surfacepressure ] ) or ( [ surfaceenergydensity2 ] ) , is realized for large enough chemical potential @xmath57 of trapped fermions .",
    "the condition for ignoring gravity is @xmath64 , which holds for @xmath73 .    for the corresponding weakly gravitating einstein bubble ( [ einsteinbubble]ab ) ,",

    "( [ dssbubblesigma1])([dssbubblesigma2 ] ) shows that this occurs for negative surface tension @xmath45 under the following conditions and tension @xmath45 as quantities independent of gravity is only valid if the relative jump of the metric is small .",

    "] : @xmath76 under these conditions , one has @xmath77    in the limit of large @xmath78 , a cosmological horizon is developing asymptotically from the inside and a black - hole horizon from the outside . for a ` poor physicist ' living inside the bubble ,",
    "the interior of the bubble resembles more and more a de - sitter universe , while , for another ` poor physicist ' living outside , the exterior of the bubble resembles more and more a black hole .",
    "and the smooth interface between the two vacua ( with nonsingular metric ) starts to look like a genuine coordinate singularity . in the same way",
    ", the finite and curved einstein universe may be thought of as the limiting case of a false - vacuum bubble ( [ einsteinbubble]ab ) in flat space .",
    "however , the limiting case of a de - sitter horizon can not be realized with an interface of fermion zero modes as discussed in sec .",
    "the reason is that eqs .",
    "( [ surfaceenergydensity2 ] ) and ( [ conditions1 ] ) require the energy of the interface without fermion - zero - mode contribution to be negative , @xmath79 .",
    "hence , the static de - sitter universe with cosmological horizon probably can not be constructed using known interfaces , even though suitable planck - scale interfaces are not excluded .",
    "the static de - sitter universe @xcite ( or the static einstein universe @xcite ) and the @xmath38ball with false vacuum @xcite can be viewed as extreme limits of the same physical object . for both",
    ", the vacuum energy is of crucial importance , as well as the surface energy density and ( negative ) surface tension of the membrane separating the interior region from the external environment .",
    "in addition , there may be an important role for a conserved fermionic charge @xmath38 inside the bubble or on the membrane .    in the limit of small surface energy density and large negative surface tension , a cosmological horizon is developing asymptotically from the inside and a black - hole horizon from the outside . in this way ,",
    "one nearly obtains a static de - sitter universe embedded in a schwarzschild spacetime as discussed previously @xcite for black holes with physical horizons and false vacua in their interior .",
    "however , the limiting case can not be realized using known physical interfaces .",
    "this also implies that , most likely , emergent gravity is not able to incorporate the geodesically - complete einstein universe with spatial section @xmath11 .",
    "( for a hausdorff manifold , this would indeed be difficult to imagine topologically . )",
