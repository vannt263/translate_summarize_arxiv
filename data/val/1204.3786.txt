    "an extensive literature is available on applications of stochastic orders to finance and insurance markets .",
    "the implications of stochastic orders for derivative pricing and risk management are relevant .  the increasing dependence of european option prices by the riskiness of the underlying it is a well known property for basic models like that of black - merton - scholes , in which riskiness is expressed in terms of the logreturns distribution variance :",
    "the uncertainty is quantified there through the dispersion around the expected value and the distribution functions can be ordered according to their `` peakedness '' ; the larger is the dispersions , the higher the option prices .",
    "this very elementary and intuitive observation for simple models become more involved when turning attention to more complex models , where a more rigorous approach is necessary in order to avoid wrong conclusions .",
    "the black - merton - scholes model is nowadays considered fairly inadequate to describe the asset price dynamics ; several empirical facts can not be explained on the basis of this model : some statistical features exhibited by logreturns like fat tails , volatility clustering , aggregational gaussianity and the so - called leverage effect are completely outside of the prevision properties of the black - merton - scholes model . moreover a very relevant phenomenon exhibited by option prices , the `` volatility smile '' ( and its term structure ) can not be explained on this model basis . in order to provide a more satisfactory description",
    "several different models have been introduced .",
    "some of these models introduce a stocastic dependence in volatility and/or jumps in asset logreturns ( and/or in volatility ) dynamics both in continuous and discrete time setting .    among discrete time models introduced in order to remove some of the black - merton - scholes model drawbacks ,",
    "the class of autoregressive conditioned heteroschedastic ( arch ) models introduced by engle @xcite and their general extension ( garch models ) proposed by bollerslev in bollerslev have risen considerable interest .",
    "several results related to stochastic orders are available for the continuous time models class : in @xcite , where a systematic investigation on semimartingale models is performed ; the models considered there include the heston and the barndorff - nielsen and shephard models . in @xcite",
    "t. mller provides some results on stochastic orders in a dynamic reinsurance market where the traded risk process is driven by a compound poisson process and the claim amount is unbounded .",
    "stochastic order  properties have been used to obtain bounds for option prices in incomplete markets ; the literature focused on this subject is quite extensive and we just mention the papers by el karoui et al .",
    "@xcite , by bellamy and jeanblanc , and by gushchin and mordecki @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to present a systematic investigation of stochastic orders propagation in a garch  context .",
    "comparison with stochastic orders in incomplete market models can give rise to different classes of problems : first can be considered the comparison of models under the same probability measure but with different parametric specification , second it can be examined the problem of comparing the same model under different probability measures ; as a matter of fact , when markets are incomplete , there are several probability measures equivalent to the historical one , under which the dynamics of prices can be given .",
    "in this paper we shall focus on the first class of problems mentioned : we shall provide a systematic comparison of logreturns and then of prices when the model parameters change , but the dynamics is specified under the same probability measure . in a garch context the parameters entering into play are three parameters assuming a numerical value and the innovations , which are random iid variables for which the density function is assigned .",
    "we just mentioned that stochastic order results have important implications on option pricing and this holds true also in a garch context : in particular , convex order relations on logreturn sums imply increasing convex order relations on the underlying price , hence on european call option prices and this can be considered the main relevance of our results from an application viewpoint .",
    "we like to present a numerical illustration in order to motivate our investigation .",
    "fig 1 compare the densities of the logreturn sums in a garch ( 1,1 ) model with respect to variations in the parameters @xmath0 ; in the continuous line all parameters assume the value 0.2 , while the other lines represent the same density , but with parameters @xmath1,@xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively ( the parameter assuming the value 0.5 in indicated by a capital letter in each curve caption ) .",
    "the sums include the first 50 terms of the logreturn sequence .",
    "+    the innovations , assumed to be independent and identically distributed , and the initial variance , are chosen as standard gaussian random variables .",
    "it is evident how the usual real numbers order relation between parameters implies some ordering on logreturn sums ; it then arises as a natural question to ask if this simple remark can be made rigorous and if this conclusion can be cast into a more general framework considering different kind of stochastic orders and comparing stochastic order propagation from innovations to logreturns and to logreturns sums .    in the following section we present briefly the garch models and an auxiliary lemma . in section 3",
    "we present the univariate stochastic comparisons for logreturns in a garch setting . in section 4",
    "we provide results on some related orders , while in section 5 the convex order propagation of the logreturn sums is investigated together with its implications on asset and european call option prices , while their multivariate convex order propagation is the subject of section 6 .",
    "we focus our attention on the garch(1,1 ) case in the last section .",
    "the main results provided in this paper require the assumption of a symmetric probability density for innovations .",
    "the extension of the stochastic order propagation analysis presented here to the case of non - symmetric innovation densities would be of great interest : both the convex order propagation result and the comparison with respect to parameter variations will be the subject of future investigation in this more general setting . moreover",
    "the identification of some convex multivariate order which naturally propagate from innovations to logreturns is another target on which our research interest will be focused .",
    "these will be the subject of our future work .",
    "we consider garch models of two different very general forms ; the first model ( m1 ) is : @xmath4=0 \\\\ \\sigma _ { n+1}=f^{i}(\\left\\vert \\varepsilon _ { n}\\right\\vert , \\sigma _ { n})% \\end{array}% \\right .",

    "when discussing the propagation of variability orderings , the normalization requirement @xmath8=1 $ ] will be dropped .",
    "the difference between model m1 and model m2 is that in the first case the recursive dynamics is defined in terms of the volatility @xmath9 , while in the second it is defined in terms of the variance @xmath10 .",
    "the usual garch ( 1,1 ) model is a particular case of both m1 and m2 , and is defined as follows:@xmath11with @xmath12 and @xmath13 , in order to guarantee covariance stationarity .",
    "both models start with a possibly random @xmath14 , by drawing a random @xmath15.the recursive equations for @xmath16 and @xmath17 are examples of `` stochastic recurrences '' in the sense of chapter 4 of @xcite . for the explicit expression of their solutions , we introduce the following notations:@xmath18as in @xcite , we have the following :    [ giennel]let @xmath19 , @xmath20 be defined as in ( [ gienne2 ] )",

    "the aim of this section is to establish comparison results for @xmath26 when the distributions of the innovations are changed from @xmath27 to @xmath28 . in order to establish these results , the assumption that the innovations are identically distributed is not necessary ( while the independency assumption is essential ) . in the following theorems",
    "only the distribution of a single innovation @xmath27 will be changed , and the impact of this change on @xmath26 will be investigated .",
    "we recall the definitions of the basic stochastic orderings :    the random variable @xmath29 is said to be smaller than @xmath30 in the usual stochastic order [ convex order , increasing convex order ] , denoted by @xmath31 [ @xmath32 , if @xmath33 \\leq e[\\phi(y)]$ ] for all increasing [ convex , increasing convex ] functions @xmath34 for which the expectations exist .",
    "we will see that in the general context of models m1 and m2 the orderings that are naturally propagated from the innovations @xmath27 to @xmath35 are the @xmath36 and the @xmath37 ordering _ between absolute values or squared variables_. this clearly completely modifies their interpretation ; in particular , in the next section we will see that the @xmath36 ordering between absolute values or squares can be interpreted as a _ variability ordering _ , while the @xmath37 ordering between absolute values or squares can be interpreted as a _",
