    "heterogeneities such as inclusions , voids , cracks , and other defects enhance the shock sensitivity of high explosives by causing additional shock dissipation that creates small regions of high temperature called hotspots  @xcite .",
    "chemical reactions initiated in the hotspots emit pressure waves that merge with the lead shock and strengthen it , so that further hotspots are created with more vigor .",
    "this positive feedback is the principal mechanism of the shock - to - detonation transition in inhomogeneous explosives  @xcite .",
    "while the significance of heterogeneities is well known , which of their characteristics are most important are not .",
    "in particular , since the details of the growth of reactions from the hotspots are not well understood , it is not known whether hotspots act separately or if the spatial arrangement of hotspots determines their efficacy .",
    "spherical voids are an often - studied , common defect in explosives  @xcite .",
    "they can become hotspots upon collapsing under shock loading , and may also cause hotspots elsewhere by their partial reflection of the lead shock and by emitting further shocks upon their collapse and explosion .",
    "inert beads produce similar effects ; while they do not collapse violently enough to become hotspots , their reflected shocks are not weakened by immediately following rarefactions and so may more easily create hotspots where they collide .",
    "experimental , theoretical , and numerical studies have sought to explain the sensitivity enhancement caused by voids and inert inclusions .",
    "bourne and field  @xcite reported results from shocked two - dimensional samples of gelatin or an emulsion explosive that had large cylindrical voids introduced .",
    "they observed that voids could shield their downstream neighbors from the lead shock , but that they could also effect the collapse of their neighbors by emitting shock waves when they collapsed .",
    "dattelbaum  @xcite shocked samples of nitromethane with randomly embedded glass beads or microballoons , observing that their presence decreased the run distance to detonation and the pressure dependence of that distance . the balloons were found to have a greater effect than the beads , and small beads were in turn more effective than large beads .",
    "medvedev  @xcite conducted a theoretical analysis of emulsion explosives with microballoons that explained changes in detonation velocity with microballoon concentration via an ignition and growth model with a constant mass burn rate per hotspot .",
    "bourne and milne  @xcite experimentally and computationally considered a hexagonal lattice of cylindrical voids in an emulsion explosive or nitromethane and observed that the reactions at the hotspots accelerated the shock relative to a comparison with water . in a previous report",
    "@xcite we used molecular dynamics ( md ) to simulate single circular voids ( and their periodic images ) in a two - dimensional model solid explosive ; the one rank of voids was able to induce a shock - to - detonation transition in the downstream material . in this study , we extend those simulations to samples with structured and unstructured two - dimensional arrangements of voids .",
    "we simulate piston impacts on a number of samples with several equal - sized circular voids either randomly placed or in a regular square or triangular lattice .",
    "we parameterize the possible lattices by their symmetry , the total porosity @xmath0 ( proportion of molecules removed from the perfect crystal ) , and the radius @xmath1 of each void .",
    "the spacing between voids in the square lattice is then @xmath2 the principal goal is to determine which of these parameters have a significant effect on the sensitivity of the explosive , as measured by the time @xmath3  from piston impact to detonation transition .",
    "we also look for nonadditive contributions from the arrangement of voids ( rather than their simple number density ) and explore the mechanism of the development of detonation .      the reactive empirical bond order ( rebo ) `` ab '' potential ( originally developed in  @xcite ) describes an exothermic @xmath4 reaction in a diatomic molecular solid and exhibits typical detonation properties but with a sub - micron , sub - ns reaction zone that is amenable to md space and time scales .",
    "heim  modified it to give a more molecular ( and less plasmalike ) chapman - jouguet state  @xcite .",
    "we utilize the spasm ( scalable parallel short - range molecular dynamics ) code  @xcite and the modified rebo potential ( `` modeliv '' ) also utilized in our previous study  @xcite .",
    "the masses of a and b atoms are 12 and 14  amu ; a standard leapfrog - verlet integrator is used with a fixed timestep of 0.509  fs in the nve ensemble .",
    "our two - dimensional samples are rectangles of herringbone crystal with two ab molecules in each @xmath5    unit cell .",
    "the shock propagates in the @xmath6 direction ; the samples are periodic in the transverse @xmath7 direction .",
    "each circular void is created by removing all dimers whose midpoints lie within a circle of a given radius .",
    "the atoms are assigned random velocities corresponding to a temperature of 1  mk and an additional bulk velocity @xmath8 directed into an infinite - mass piston formed by three frozen layers of unit cells at the @xmath9 end .",
    "the temperature is chosen to be small to avoid significant thermal expansion of the crystal but nonzero to avoid spurious effects from a mathematically perfect crystal ; the rms atomic displacement it causes is 2.1  pm .",
    "each simulation is run until the shock ( whether reacting or not ) reaches the free end of the sample ; the traversal time of the shock ( assuming that it does not accelerate ) is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the shock velocity hugoniot .",
    "it is broadly similar throughout the simulations , so the determination of whether or not a detonation occurs is meaningfully consistent . in particular , in each of the principal studies the sample length @xmath12 is held fixed so that @xmath13 is constant for each @xmath14 .",
    "analysis of the results , including dynamic identification of molecules , location of the lead shock , and determination of detonation transition times , follows  @xcite , except that when finding the detonation transition we keep the shock positions 15  nm apart for greater noise resistance .",
    "we consider 94 square lattices : 27 with an integer number @xmath15 of voids ( in each periodic image ) and 67 with @xmath15 allowed to merely approximate an integer ( so the last void s distance to the end of the sample differs slightly from the first s to the piston ) . for brevity , we will term these two cases s@xmath16  and s@xmath17  respectively .    in case",
    "s@xmath16 , each combination of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is considered , with @xmath20  m  chosen so that @xmath21 is always an integer ( @xmath22 $ ] ) , and each choice is simulated at each piston velocity @xmath23 ; 6947762070048 atoms are simulated . in case",
    "s@xmath17 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are fixed , and the 67 @xmath0-@xmath1 pairs from @xmath26 that yield an @xmath15 within 0.075 of an integer are simulated ( @xmath27 $ ] , 2607361341296 atoms ) .",
    "the fixed velocity and loosened constraint on @xmath15 allow this study to explore the @xmath0-@xmath1 space more effectively .    in an ancillary study called case  t , rectangular and triangular lattices of @xmath28 voids are each simulated 27 times with a fixed @xmath29 and every combination of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . here",
    "the void spacings are @xmath33 and @xmath34 ; 2140601206248 atoms are simulated .    in the random case , a fixed sample size of @xmath35",
    "is used with three different @xmath36 triples taken from the case  s@xmath16  lattices ( but with more voids because of the increased sample area ) : 1 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 , 2 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and 3 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 . for each set of parameters ,",
    "10 simulations are run with different random arrangements of voids chosen by the simple rejection method such that all void centers are at least @xmath43 away from either surface of the sample and at least @xmath44 away from each other .",
    "this largest case involves @xmath453.1  million atoms .",
    "the transition times for the 53 ( of 67 ) case  s@xmath17  samples that detonated are shown in fig .",
    "the plane is a fit to the data ; its equation is @xmath46 .",
    "the cases that did not detonate before the shock reached the free surface ( @xmath47 ) would occupy the rear corner of the plot ( smallest @xmath0 and largest @xmath1 ) .",
    "the proportion of atoms that form product molecules was generally 85% but dropped to 65% in that corner .",
    "the half of those 14 simulations closer to the ones which detonated ended with detonation evidently imminent , but they are not counted as having detonated since a transition time could not be identified .    from case  s@xmath17 .",
    "the grid shows every @xmath0 and every fourth @xmath1 value and is a planar fit to the data , which are shown as crosses connected to it by lines to place them in space and indicate the discrepancies .",
    "the upper limit of the plotting region is the length of the longest , non - detonating simulations ( 78.2  ps ) . ]    at early times , we observe that the extent of reaction closely follows a very simple ignition and growth model .",
    "suppose that a reacting hotspot is a disk that is created with a finite radius @xmath48 upon collapse of the void and grows at a constant speed @xmath49 into the surrounding unreacted material until it overlaps its periodic images .",
    "if the disk contains a constant areal number density @xmath50 of reacted atoms , the number of reacted atoms as a function of time since initiation has the form @xmath51 in fig .",
    "iandg are plotted the counts of reacted atoms from the beginning of the least reactive case  s@xmath17  simulation , and the results of fitting one and two copies of @xmath52 to them , corresponding to the first and then the second periodic line of voids being ignited .",
    "the two copies use the same growth parameters and are merely each shifted in time to match the data . other case  s@xmath17  simulations have similar behavior , but the growth parameters depend in an unknown fashion on @xmath1 and @xmath14 ,",
    "so we have no general model for @xmath53 .     and @xmath54   .",
    "the values from the ignition and growth model applied to the first void and to the first two voids are also shown ; the latter curve is almost everywhere indistinguishable from the simulation values . ]    fig .",
    "spires shows the temperature distribution history from the other extreme case  s@xmath17  simulation , with the smallest ( eligible ) @xmath1 at the largest @xmath0 .",
    "each point in the figure is calculated with respect to the center of mass motion of , and averaged over , a column of computational cells of width @xmath55  nm . we note here the development of a broad pressure wave in the shocked material , visible both as a region of strong advection intersecting the detonation transition and as a temperature increase between the last few hotspots created before the transition .",
    "it appears that the pressure waves emitted by the first several hotspots merge and the combined wave strengthens itself by encouraging the deflagration at each hotspot it encounters .",
    "when this wave overtakes the lead shock , its particle velocity is approximately equal to @xmath25 , so the relative velocity in the collisions at the shock doubles and detonation begins immediately .",
    ", @xmath56   , @xmath25 .",
    "only the region of space occupied by the sample at its final compression is shown .",
    "each spire at the lower left is a hotspot ; the very hot region at large @xmath57 , bounded below by a much faster shock , is the detonation .",
    "note the left - moving shock generated at the transition and the pressure wave ( apparent as a temporary strong advection ) visible in the shocked material between @xmath58  nm and @xmath59  nm . ]",
    "all but 3 of the 27 case  s@xmath16  simulations produced a detonation ; those that did not used the lowest @xmath14 and ( again ) occupied the @xmath60/@xmath61 corner of that slice of the parameter space .",
    "the transition times for the rest are shown in fig .",
    "vn ; they follow the pattern of case  s@xmath17  with the unsurprising addition that @xmath62 .",
    "the middle surface has the same @xmath14 as case  s@xmath17  and shows some non - planarity beyond the range of fig .  vn2 . with appropriate @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "we see detonations even at @xmath63 , which is much smaller than any value observed to trigger detonation with merely one periodic rank of voids  @xcite ; the feedback is much strengthened by the subsequent hotspots .    from case  s@xmath16 .",
    "the missing points for the smallest @xmath14 indicate failures to detonate . ]",
    "in case  t , the rectangular and triangular lattices did not differ significantly : they produced similar reaction yields and no detonations ( presumably because they were relatively short ; the case  s@xmath16  simulations corresponding to the most reactive case treated here detonated after 8790  ps ) .",
    "we would expect the triangular case to have a greater reactivity than the rectangular because the overlap between hotspots in adjacent columns is delayed by their offset .",
    "the difference is never more than 5% of the area , however , and lasts only until the overlap is complete ( about 30% of the reaction phase ) , so it may be difficult to measure . for 3 , a consistent transition time of @xmath64 was observed .",
    "the mean is 15.5% larger than the @xmath3  from the corresponding case  s@xmath16  simulation ; the small standard deviation suggests that the details of the void arrangement are not significant .",
    "furthermore , examination of one such simulation shows that a tight arrangement of 5 voids approximately 30% of the way down the sample produces no extra reactions .",
    "later , a triangle of 6 voids triggers the transition , but spontaneous reactions elsewhere along the shock are also doing so simultaneously , as shown in fig .",
    "none of the other random arrangements detonated .",
    "2 produced yields of @xmath65 ( where the second percentage is relative ) whereas its case  s@xmath16  counterpart detonated .",
    "1 produced @xmath66 as compared to 70.1% for its counterpart .",
    "these differences are between normalized quantities , yet are partially due to the fact that the case  s@xmath16  samples were 26.1% longer .",
    "it is to be expected that the detonation transition time @xmath3  decreases with an increase in either the porosity @xmath0 or piston velocity @xmath14 , but that it increases with radius ( @xmath67 ) deserves further consideration .",
    "first it should be noted that @xmath68 : enlarging each of a set of voids without moving them ( , keeping the separation @xmath69 fixed ) does enhance the reactivity .",
    "however , when holding @xmath0 fixed the reduction in number density overwhelms the effect of increasing the void size .",
    "the simple ignition and growth model used earlier provides an explanation .",
    "before any detonation begins , any point in the material is reacted if and only if it is closer to the location of a void collapse than the @xmath70 associated with that void  @xcite .",
    "since all voids near a given point will collapse at nearly the same time , what matters is the expected minimum distance @xmath71 to a void ( after shock compression ) .",
    "we expect that @xmath72 , so the material will react sooner , on average , with small voids   until , of course , the voids become so small that they no longer reliably produce any reactions at all .",
    "( for the smallest @xmath14 considered here , that failure radius is approximately 2  nm  @xcite . )",
    "a caveat is that if @xmath48 or @xmath49 is a strong function of @xmath1 , the larger average distances from larger voids might be ovewhelmed by more vigorous growth of the hotspots created by larger voids .",
    "while we do not have a model for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , they appear to be weak ( perhaps sublinear ) functions of @xmath1 , in which case the conclusion of more reactivity from smaller voids holds .",
    "that @xmath49 is a function of @xmath1 at all is interesting ; we suppose that the @xmath1-dependent strength of the reshock emitted when the void collapses and explodes in place may imprint on its surrounds a memory of the void s size .",
    "the model also explains how disorder in the arrangement of voids increases @xmath3 .",
    "whenever , in the random placement of voids , two or more are placed much closer than @xmath69 to one another , their hotspots will overlap very quickly and the total burn front area will then be reduced ; equivalently , @xmath71 is larger for a random arrangement than for a lattice ( especially a hexagonal one ) at the same @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the broad pressure wave created by the lead hotspots seems to be the principal mechanism for the detonation transition in this system .",
    "its development , the identical growth of the first two hotspots , the similarity of the results from rectangular and triangular lattices , the consistency among the results from random void arrangements , and the apparent irrelevance of void clusters all suggest that the development of a detonation is a collective effect that depends on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and the regularity of the void arrangement but not on the details of that arrangement .",
    "this collectivity affords a major simplification in predicting the behavior of collections of voids : a model might need only @xmath1 , @xmath0 , and @xmath75 .",
    "finally , we note that the function @xmath74 , since it will likely dominate @xmath73 and appears to depend on both its arguments but not on time , may prove useful as a measure of the strength or activity of a hotspot that might be incorporated into an analytical reaction rate model . for voids of non - uniform size",
    ", it might be sufficient to consider the variation of @xmath49 in calculating a point s expected burn time .",
