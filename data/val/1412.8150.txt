    "the nonlinear einstein - maxwell field equations are necessary for the description of the behaviour of relativistic gravitating matter with or without electromagnetic field distributions , and they are tools for modeling relativistic compact objects such as dark energy stars , gravastars , quark stars , black holes and neutron stars . with the help of diverse solutions of the field equations and different matter configurations , the structure and properties of relativistic stellar bodies have been investigated .",
    "this is reflected in several investigations over the recent past .",
    "models of neutral compact spheres with isotropic pressures have been studied by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the case of neutral anisotropic matter was investigated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "charged isotropic compact models are highlighted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . the general model with charge and anisotropy",
    "was analysed by esculpi and aloma ( 2010 ) , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "several interesting features of exact solutions to the einstein - maxwell system for charged anisotropic quark stars were highlighted in the treatments of @xcite and sunzu et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the effect of the electromagnetic distribution and pressure anisotropy are important ingredients to be considered when undertaking studies of relativistic stellar objects .",
    "@xcite highlighted the fact that the presence of charge in a compact stellar matter contributes to changes in the mass , redshift and luminosity .",
    "it was shown by @xcite that charged models could allow causal signals in the stellar interior over a wide range of parameters .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite demonstrated that pressure anisotropy affects the physical properties , stability and structure of stellar matter .",
    "the stability of stellar bodies is improved for positive measure of anisotropy when compared to configurations of isotropic stellar objects .",
    "furthermore the maximum mass and the redshift depend on the magnitude of the pressure anisotropy as illustrated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they also showed that the presence of anisotropic pressures in charged matter enhances the stability of the configuration under radial adiabatic perturbations when compared to isotropic matter .",
    "there have been many recent investigations which include the presence of charge and anisotropy in the stellar interior .",
    "for example , @xcite presented regular models for charged anisotropic stellar bodies , generalized isothermal models were found by @xcite , and superdense models were investigated by @xcite .",
    "other new exact solutions for charged anisotropic stars are contained in the treatment of maharaj and mafa takisa ( 2012 ) .",
    "some other models describing anisotropic static spheres with variable energy density include the works of cosenza et al .",
    "( 1981 ) , @xcite and herrera and santos ( 1997 ) .    on physical grounds for a stellar model we should include a barotropic equation of state so that the radial pressure is a function of the energy density .",
    "exact models of charged anisotropic matter with a quadratic equation of state were found by @xcite . using the same equation of state , maharaj and mafa takisa ( 2012 ) generated regular models for charged anisotropic stars .",
    "a strange star model with a quadratic equation of state was recently generated by @xcite .",
    "polytropic models were analysed by @xcite for charged matter with anisotropic stresses .",
    "@xcite found charged stellar models with a van der waals and generalized van der waals equation of state respectively .",
    "anisotropic models with a modified van der waals equations of state are contained in the paper by @xcite .",
    "other relativistic stellar models with a van der waals equation of state are studied in the treatment of @xcite .",
    "however for a quark star we require a linear equation of state . the first treatment of quark stars was undertaken by @xcite for hydrostatic matter in equilibrium .",
    "since then there have been many investigations on the study of structure and properties of quark matter by adopting a linear equation of state .",
    "it has been shown by @xcite , @xcite , farhi and jaffe ( 1984 ) that quark matter could be studied with the aid of the phenomenology of the mit bag model ; these studies indicate that a linear quark matter equation of state with a nonzero bag constant can be used .",
    "the review by @xcite described the astrophysical phenomenology of compact quark stars .",
    "the study of nonradial oscillations of quark stars was performed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "charged isotropic models for quark stars are described by @xcite and komathiraj and maharaj ( 2007 ) .",
    "particular models have been analysed to study the effect of both the electric field and the anisotropy in quark stars are those generated by rahaman et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , maharaj and thir - ukkanesh ( 2009b ) and @xcite .",
    "however most charged anisotropic models of quark stars have anisotropy always present and do not regain isotropic pressures as a special case .",
    "charged anisotropic models for quark stars that allow anisotropy to vanish have been found in the papers by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to find new exact solutions to the einstein - maxwell system of equations with a linear quark matter equation of state for charged anisotropic stars .",
    "we build new models by specifying a particular form for one of the gravitational potentials and the measure of anisotropy .",
    "the model allows us to regain isotropic pressures as a special case . to achieve this objective we structure this paper accordingly . in section [ sectiontwo ]",
    "we give the fundamental equations and transformation of the field equations according to @xcite and incorporate the linear quark matter equation of state .",
    "we then specify a new form for one of the gravitational potential and the measure of anisotropy which are physically viable and reasonable .",
    "this helps to deduce the master differential equation governing the behaviour of our model . in section [ sectionthree ]",
    "we generate a regular model and regain the einstein model with isotropic pressures .",
    "we show that this class produces objects with finite mass . in section [ sectionfour ]",
    "we find a second class of solutions .",
    "this class has variable potentials and singularity at the centre . in section [ sectionfive ]",
    "we give graphical analysis and make concluding remarks .",
    "we intend to describe stellar structure with quark matter in a general relativistic setting . the spacetime manifold must be static and spherically symmetric .",
    "the interior spacetime is given by the metric @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are arbitrary functions .",
    "the reissner - nordstrom line element describes the exterior spacetime @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent total mass and charge as measured by an observer at infinity .",
    "the energy momentum tensor @xmath6 describes anisotropic charged matter .",
    "the energy density @xmath7 , the radial pressure @xmath8 , the tangential pressure @xmath9 , and the electric field intensity @xmath10 are measured relative to a vector * u*. the vector @xmath11 is comoving , unit and timelike .",
    "the einstein - maxwell equations with matter and charge can be written as    [ emf ] @xmath12    where primes indicate differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 denotes the proper charge density .",
    "note that we are using units where the coupling constant @xmath15 and the speed of light @xmath16 .",
    "the mass contained within the charged sphere is defined by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy density when the electric field @xmath19 . for a quark star we have a linear relationship between the radial pressure and the energy density @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the bag constant .",
    "we transform the field equations to an equivalent form by introducing a new independent variable @xmath22 and defining metric functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are arbitrary constants . with this transformation",
    "the line element in ( [ line - element ] ) becomes @xmath28 the mass function ( [ mass1 ] ) becomes @xmath29 where @xmath30 and a dot represents differentiation with respect to the variable @xmath22 .",
    "then we can write the einstein - maxwell field equations ( [ emf ] ) , with the quark equation of state ( [ eqnstate ] ) , in the following form    [ nnewemf ] @xmath31    the gravitational behaviour of the anisotropic charged quark star is governed by the system ( [ nnewemf ] ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath32 is called the measure of anisotropy .",
    "the system of equations ( [ nnewemf ] ) consists of eight variables @xmath33 in six equations .",
    "the advantage of the einstein - maxwell system ( [ nnewemf ] ) is that it has a simple representation : it is given in terms of the matter variables @xmath34 , the charged quantities @xmath35 and the gravitational potentials @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "we rewrite ( [ nnewemf4 ] ) in a more simplified form as @xmath38 this is a highly nonlinear equation in general .",
    "however if @xmath37 and @xmath39 are given functions then the form ( [ simplified - nnewemf4 ] ) of the field equation is linear in the variable @xmath36 . in order to find exact solutions to this model",
    "we will specify the two quantities @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "we choose the metric function as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constants .",
    "this choice guarantees that the metric function @xmath37 is continuous and well behaved within the interior of the star for a range of values of @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the metric function @xmath37 is also finite at the centre of the star .",
    "we specify the measure of anisotropy in the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 are arbitrary constants .",
    "a similar choice of anisotropy was made by @xcite .",
    "this choice is physically reasonable as it is continuous and well behaved throughout the interior of the star .",
    "it is finite at the centre of the star .",
    "it is possible to regain isotropic pressures when @xmath47 .",
    "we then have @xmath48 and the anisotropy vanishes . substituting ( [ choice - y ] ) and ( [ choice - delta ] ) in ( [ simplified - nnewemf4 ] ) we obtain the first order differential equation @xmath49 } { ( 1+bx^{n})h(x)}z\\nonumber\\\\ & & = -\\dfrac{\\left(\\frac{(a_{1}x+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3 } ) x}{c}+1-\\frac{2xb}{c}\\right)l(x)}{h(x ) } , \\label{newmodelode1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath50,\\\\ l(x)&=&(1-ax^{m})(1+bx^{n}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for convenience .",

    "we can therefore interpret the exact solution ( [ exact - submodel ] ) as a generalized einstein model with charge and anisotropy .",
    "this possibility arises only because the energy density at the boundary is a nonzero constant in a quark star .",
    "the solutions found in this section do represent finite masses that can be related to observed objects . to show this we introduce the transformations + @xmath71 , @xmath72 , + @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 .",

    "it is possible that other exact solutions exist , in addition to those found above , and which may be obtained using the approach of this paper .",

    "the solutions to the field equations are found after making a reasonable physical choice for the measure of anisotropy and one of the gravitational potentials .",
