    "solar activity has been studied from the time of galileo who made first use of a telescope for the observation of sunspots .",
    "since solar activity affects space weather , it is important to develop new methods for the prediction of solar activity .",
    "it is well established that solar dynamo plays an important role in explaning the quasi - periodic behaviour of the solar cycle @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the solar dynamo alone can not explain the formation of sunspots and active regions .    in spite of comprehensive observations of solar activity , the mechanism for the formation of sunspots",
    "is still a subject of active discussions .",
    "the traditional point of view is that the dynamo mechanism generates very strong , weakly non - uniform magnetic field at the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "since this magnetic field is buoyant , it rises up , reaches the solar surface and creates a bipolar region @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years this idea has not been supported by helioseismology @xcite , by numerical simulations @xcite or by stability analysis @xcite .",
    "another mechanism for the formation of sunspots is the kinematic effect of flux expulsion @xcite .",
    "for instance , this can occur in large - scale convective circulations where the magnetic field is expelled from regions of fast motion .",
    "however , since this is a laminar effect , the role of a fully developed turbulence in this phenomenon is not clear .",
    "an alternative mechanism for the formation of magnetic spots is associated with the negative effective magnetic pressure instability ( nempi ) in strongly stratified turbulence .",
    "this mechanism is based on the idea that a mean magnetic field causes a strong suppression of the total ( kinetic and magnetic ) turbulent pressure .",
    "this phenomenon results in the effective magnetic pressure ( the sum of non - turbulent and turbulent contributions to the mean magnetic pressure ) becoming negative and a large - scale mhd instability ( i.e. , nempi ) can be excited .",
    "this instability can not produce any new magnetic flux .",
    "it only redistributes the mean magnetic field in space so that the regions with super - equipartition magnetic fields become separated by regions with weak magnetic field .",
    "this phenomenon has been investigated analytically @xcite and detected in direct numerical simulations ( dns ) @xcite .",
    "nempi can also create bipolar regions in turbulence with an external coronal envelope @xcite .",
    "this mechanism is consistent with the idea that magnetic spots are formed in the upper part of the convective zone ( see brandenburg 2005 ) .",
    "the bipolar regions are also formed in a two - layer turbulence with the dynamo generated field in the lower layer @xcite .",
    "the destruction of the bipolar regions is related to a magnetic reconnection @xcite .    from an observational point of view ,",
    "a key parameter characterising the solar activity is the wolf number , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of sunspot groups and @xmath2 is the total number of sunspots in the visible part of the sun .",
    "this parameter has been measured over the span of three centuries @xcite . based on ideas of nempi",
    ", we formulate a phenomenological budget equation for the evolution of wolf numbers .",
    "this equation describes the competition between the rate of production and decay of sunspots .",
    "we take into account the following facts : ( i ) the rate of production and decay of sunspots depends on the mean magnetic field ; ( ii ) the period of the dynamo waves is 11 years , while wolf numbers change over much shorter times ( up to 1 - 3 month ) .",
    "these conditions allow us to use a steady - state solution of the budget equation for the evolution of wolf numbers together with numerical solutions of the dynamo equations .",
    "these dynamo equations take into account the dynamic and algebraic nonlinearities of the total alpha effect ( the sum of kinetic and magnetic parts of alpha effect ) .",
    "the dynamic nonlinearity is associated with the evolution equation for the current helicity that is related to small - scale magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "we compare the wolf numbers obtained through numerical simulations with the observational data of wolf numbers .",
    "we determine the governing parameters using an optimization approach to reach maximum correlation between numerical simulations and observations ( up to 70 % ) .",
    "we also note that there could be other mechanisms for dynamics of wolf numbers related to purely statistical noise in the dynamo governing parameters caused by the averaging over a finite number of convective cells .",
    "such an effect was considered by @xcite and @xcite . based on the approach developed in the present paper and using data assimilation techniques , it is possible to apply these methods for long - term predictions of solar activity ( e.g. , wolf numbers ) .",
    "predictions of solar activity have been discussed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of improving the predictions of solar activity is still a subject of active research .",
    "we use the mean - field approach to study the solar dynamo . in particular , the induction equation for the mean field reads : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mean velocity that describes the differential rotation , @xmath5 is the magnetic diffusion due to the electrical conductivity of the fluid , @xmath6 is the mean electromotive force , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are fluctuations of the velocity and magnetic field respectively , and angular brackets denote averaging over an ensemble of fluctuations . in isotropic turbulence ,",

    "we use the no - z dynamo model , rather than a more sophisticated three - dimensional dynamo model , since the information about spatial distribution of the kinetic alpha effect is not known from observations .",
    "there is also strong dependence of the rotation ( characterized by the coriolis number ) on the depth of the convective zone ( from very slow rotation at the surface of the sun to fast rotation near the bottom of the convective zone .",
    "since the plasma density varies over seven orders of magnitude from the top to the bottom of the convective zone , it introduces additional complication in the modelling of the solar activity .",
    "this implies that an application of a more sophisticated three - dimensional dynamo model with unknown from observations coefficients for the prediction of the solar activity seems to be not improve a quality of the prediction .",
    "numerical simulations of our dynamo model with a phenomenological equation for the evolution of the wolf number demonstrates good agreement between numerical modelling and observations ( with about a 70 % correlation in observed data and simulations of wolf numbers ) . in particular , we determine the dependence of the maximum value of the wolf number in the given cycle versus the period of this cycle .",
    "we also find the asymmetry of the solar cycles versus the amplitude of the cycle .",
    "the numerical modelling performed in this study can not directly serve as an instrument for prediction of solar activity because we have not used any procedure similar to the real date assimilation as used , for instance , in the atmospheric weather prediction .",
    "however , this model describes the general features of solar activity .",
    "in particular , it indicates the decreased level of solar activity in the near future ( see figs .",
