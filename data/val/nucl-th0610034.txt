    "nuclear force is one of the oldest problem in nuclear physics .",
    "however , its theoretical description is still an unsettled issue . here , we first explain a traditional , phenomenological approach to the nuclear force , and a fairly new approach based on nuclear effective field theory ( neft)@xcite . after the explanation ,",
    "we formulate a scenario for a relation between nuclear forces based on the two approaches . the main subject in this report",
    "is to discuss the relation from a viewpoint of the renormalization group ( rg ) .    in the phenomenological nuclear force ( ) ,",
    "the long - range part is described by the one - pion - exchange potential ( opep ) .",
    "the short - range part is poorly known , and therefore a phenomenological model is used ; heavy - meson exchanges or purely phenomenological parameterization .",
    "parameters involved in the model are fixed so as to reproduce low - energy @xmath0 scattering data and the deuteron binding energy . in this way ,",
    "several high - precision @xmath0 potentials have been constructed , such as the cd - bonn and the nijmegen potentials .",
    "although these models are phenomenologically very successful , there are some problems as follows . at first , each model describes the short - range part differently , and is largely model - dependent . secondly , there is no systematic way to construct the short - range mechanism .",
    "thirdly , there is little connection to the underlying theory , qcd .",
    "in contrast , it is claimed that a nuclear force based on neft ( ) is free from the problems inherent in .",
    "the claim is based on the derivation procedure of , which is briefly given as follows .",
    "one starts with an effective chiral lagrangian , taking care of the spontaneously broken chiral symmetry of qcd .",
    "the lagrangian consists of effective degrees of freedom for a system in question , and is the most general as long as assumed symmetries are satisfied .",
    "one identifies a set of irreducible diagrams from the lagrangian with .",
    "the importance of an irreducible diagram is assigned by a counting rule .",
    "however , one may find questions about : ( q1 ) in , short - distance physics is described by contact interactions , which is much simpler compared to the short - range mechanism employed in .",
    "is the contact interaction really appropriate to describe the short - distance physics ? ( q2 )",
    "is  still one of many phase - equivalent potentials , as  is ? ( q3 ) is there any relation between model independent  and model dependent ?",
    "in fact , the answer to ( q3 ) naturally leads us to the answers to ( q1 ) and ( q2 ) .",
    "thus , we formulate a scenario for the relation between  and .",
    "it is noted that the model space ( the state space for the nucleon ) of  is considerably smaller than that of . with this point in mind , we can formulate the following scenario for the relation between  and .",
    "we may construct many  which reproduce @xmath0 scattering data and the deuteron binding energy .",
    "they are different in describing the short - distance physics , and therefore model dependent . starting with such ,",
    "we reduce their model space by integrating out the high momentum states of the nucleon . reducing the model space corresponds to viewing the system in a coarse - grained manner .",
    "as the model space is reduced , information about details of the short - distance physics is gradually lost .",
    "eventually , we obtain a low - momentum effective interaction ( @xmath1 ) defined in a reduced model space .",
    "@xmath1 does not have the model dependence which  have .",
    "a parameterization of @xmath1 constitutes .",
    "this is the scenario for the relation between  and .",
    "obtained in this way is , by construction , does not have a dependence on modelling the short - distance physics .",
    "the short - range part of @xmath1 is expected to be accurately simulated by simple contact interactions because the detailed information has been integrated out .",
    "therefore , if we show that this scenario is realized , then we can answer all of the questions raised in the previous paragraph .",
    "the purpose of this report is to confirm the scenario , thereby proposing the relation between  and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , keeping the relation in mind , we can understand features of neft more deeply , which we will discuss later .",
    "in order to examine the scenario , stated in the previous section , for the relation between  and , an appropriate model - space reduction method is necessary . in effective",
    "filed theory , we use an effective lagrangian in which high - energy degrees of freedom have been integrated out using a path integral : @xmath2 where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is high-(low- ) energy degrees of freedom , and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) consists of @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( only @xmath4 ) . an effective ( more fundamental ) lagrangian is @xmath6 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the model - space reduction , integrating out high - momentum states of the nucleon , also should be done with the path integral .",
    "although it is difficult in general , in case the lagrangian is composed by only the nucleon field and two nucleons interact through contact interactions , we can perform the path integral .",
    "it is noted that we restrict ourselves to two - nucleon system throughout this report . in the center of mass frame , performing the path integral is equivalent to solving the following wilsonian renormalization group ( wrg ) equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is @xmath0 potential for a partial wave @xmath9 , and @xmath10 the nucleon mass . in @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) denotes the off - shell relative momentum of the two nucleons before ( after ) the interaction , @xmath14 denotes the on - shell momentum , and @xmath15 is the cutoff value specifying the model space .",
    "this equation controls the evolution of @xmath8 with respect to a change of @xmath15 .",
    "this equation was firstly derived by birse _",
    "_ in a different manner@xcite .",
    "starting with several phenomenological @xmath0 potentials , we reduce their model spaces using the wrg equation , and examine the evolution .",
    "then , we simulate the obtained effective model - space interaction ( @xmath1 ) with  by adjusting parameters in it .",
    "if the simulation is accurate , then the relation between  and  through rg is realized .    in the simulation , for simplicity , we include only the opep in  as a mechanism explicitly including the pion .",
    "this is not fully consistent with weinberg s counting .",
    "because we consider contact interactions with zero , two , and four derivatives , we should include more irreducible graphs , such as a two - pion exchange potential ( tpep ) .",
    "however , we employ a rather small model space where the details of the tpep play essentially no role ; the tpep is accurately simulated by contact interactions .",
    "therefore , our simplification does not deteriorate the accuracy of the simulation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , shown are diagonal components of @xmath16 in the momentum space .",
    "there is the clear model dependence among , which almost disappears after the model - space reduction down to @xmath15 = 200 mev .",
    "the obtained @xmath1 is accurately simulated by the opep and a few contact interactions , which we do not show here . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , diagonal components of @xmath17 ( @xmath15=200mev ) obtained from the cd - bonn potential is simulated using the opep and one or two contact interactions .",
    "we see that the simulation is very accurate .",
    "obtained in this way also accurately simulates the off - diagonal components of @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath0-potential @xmath18 .",
    "the solid curve is @xmath1(@xmath15=200mev ) resulting from the cd - bonn potential .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) curve is a simulation of @xmath1 using the opep plus one ( two ) contact interaction(s ) .",
    "the dash - dotted curve is the opep .",
    ", width=283 ]     @xmath0-potential @xmath18 .",
    "the solid curve is @xmath1(@xmath15=200mev ) resulting from the cd - bonn potential .",
    "the dashed ( dotted ) curve is a simulation of @xmath1 using the opep plus one ( two ) contact interaction(s ) .",
    "the dash - dotted curve is the opep .",
    ", width=283 ]",
    "we have seen in the previous section that the scenario for the relation between  and  is realized . although we have shown the relation employing a rather small model space , if the tpep and higher order opep are properly included in , then the relation should hold true for a larger model space as well ; probably safe up to @xmath19 400 mev . in a certain large model space where the very details of the tpep is considerable , _",
    "i.e. _ , a phenomenological model can not mimic the tpep any more , the relation may not hold true .",
    "we have been concerned with only the strong nucleon - nucleon interaction . however , this kind of relation probably exists also in other nuclear operators , such as electroweak currents and pion production operators .",
    "now , based on our result , we discuss in the following some features of neft which the traditional approach does not have ; the discussion is not always restricted to the nuclear force .",
    "one is that nuclear operators based on neft are constructed perturbatively .",
    "therefore , one can systematically improve the accuracy , and can discuss theoretical uncertainty .",
    "we note that , for a convergent perturbation , it is necessary to define an operator in a suitably small model space .",
    "we also note that the convergence of the neft - based perturbative expansion is not always good for some processes .",
    "another is that neft - based operators are model independent , which has been often claimed .",
    "however , the claim is based on the procedure of deriving the nuclear operators , which is not a quantitative argument . in this work",
    ", we quantitatively showed that  does not have the dependence on modelling the details of short - distance physics .",
    "this is a consequence of viewing the system roughly , thereby ignoring the detailed structure of the short - distance physics .",
    "it is noted , therefore , a description of a system based on neft is not always better than those based on phenomenological models . in many cases , they give essentially the same low - energy observables because they are equivalent through the rg .",
    "neft may have superiority in cases where detailed information about multi - pion exchange mechanism play an important role .",
    "finally , with neft , one can describe a system more efficiently and simply , compared to the phenomenological models .",
    "the efficiency is due to the perturbative calculation , and the simplicity is due to the ignorance of the details of the short - distance physics .    to summarize , we considered the nuclear force from the viewpoint of the rg , and showed that there exists the equivalence relation between and .",
    "we simultaneously showed that  does not have the model dependence due to the details of the short - distance physics , and that the simple contact interactions in  accurately describe the short - distance physics in a certain small model space .",
    "based on the result , we discussed the new features in neft ."
