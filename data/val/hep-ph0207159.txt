    "annihilation of @xmath0 in the double - logarithmic approximation ( dla ) was considered first in ref .  @xcite . in this work",
    "it was shown that when the total energy of the annihilation is high enough , the most sizable radiative qed corrections to @xmath0 annihilation into @xmath4 are double - logarithmic ( dl ) .",
    "these corrections were calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite to all orders in @xmath5 .",
    "the dl contributions to this process appear when the final @xmath4 -pair is produced in the regge kinematics , i.e. when the muons move ( in cmf ) closely to the initial @xmath0 -beam direction . according to the terminology introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , the process where @xmath6 moves in the @xmath7 -direction is called forward ( backward ) annihilation .",

    "the forward and backward annihilation of @xmath0 into quarks , all chiralities accounted for , was considered recently in ref .",
    "one of the features obtained in refs  @xcite-@xcite is that the forward scattering amplitudes in dla are greater than the backward ones in qed , in qcd and in ew theory .    besides these @xmath8 , i.e. elastic processes , it is interesting also to study the @xmath9 -exclusive processes accounting for emission of @xmath10 bosons accompanying the elastic @xmath8 annihilation .",
    "the point is that besides the conventional , ( soft ) bremsstrahlung there can be emitted harder bosons .",
    "emission of such bosons can be also studied in dla to all orders in the couplings , providing the hard bosons are emitted in cones with opening angles @xmath11 around the initial @xmath0 beams , i.e. in the multi - regge kinematics . in this case , the most important part of the inelastic scattering amplitudes accounting for emission of @xmath10 bosons consists of the kinematic factor @xmath12 multiplied by some function @xmath13 which is called the multi - regge amplitude of the process .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath13 is controlled by @xmath14 electroweak reggeons propagating in the crossing channel .",
