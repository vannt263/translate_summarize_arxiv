    "the description of many - body systems is one of the most difficult problems in nuclear physics due to the complexity of this kind of systems which are quantum objects described by a large number of degrees of freedom .",
    "a large variety of theoretical models have been developed using mean - field based and beyond - mean field approaches like density functional theory@xcite and energy density function theory @xcite . in these approaches which use the independent particle approximation as a starting point , phenomenological effective interaction like skyrme and gogny forces",
    "are widely used taking advantage of their simple form@xcite . in nuclear structure modeling we can quote the skyrme - harthree - fock ( shf ) methods , the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) approach ( as well as their bogoliubov extensions ) , and the harthree - fock - bogoliubov methods with the finite - range gogny force @xcite . as an example we can quote the work of p .- g.reinhard et al @xcite in which the liquid drop parameters have been obtained starting from microscopic shf and rmf calculations with a rather wide variety of skyrme interactions .",
    "each of them produce energy functionals with parameters adjusted to reproduce the basic nuclear bulk properties in the valley of stability .",
    "complexity still becomes higher when nuclear dynamics , triggered by nuclear collisions , is studied to understand the property of nuclear forces far from the stability . at the fermi energy and beyond ,",
    "semiclassical methods become necessary to describe the produced processes in which practically all the degrees of freedom are involved .",
    "many - body correlations are responsible for the reorganization of the hot nuclear matter(nm ) in to clusters .",
    "two main classes of approaches have been developed to handle this complex scenario .",
    "the first one is based on the boltzman transport equation including two and , at the higher energy , also three body collisions term@xcite . in this case",
    "the theoretical approach is able to describe the time evolution of the one - body distribution function in phase - space .",
    "apart from the collision term , the boltzman equation corresponds to the semi - classical limit of time - dependent harthree - fock equations in phase - space .",
    "different models have been implemented on this ground .",
    "they essentially differ from each other in the strategy adopted to simulate the collision terms and in the way to represent the phase - space distribution starting from the nucleonic degree of freedom ( test particle methods ) . as in the harthrre - fock mean field method the main ingredient concerning",
    "the interaction is the energy density which for a skyrme type phenomenological interaction has a rather manageable form . in particular the local part of",
    "the interaction produces a simple functional for the potential energy expressed through an algebraic function of the density ( see also sec.ii ) . in the early 90",
    "a further development included stochastic forces ( typical of langevin processes ) @xcite in the so called stochastic mean field model @xcite to produce fluctuations capable of describing associated phenomena like mean - field instabilities leading to the cluster production .",
    "the second line of development of theoretical semiclassical approaches to deal the nuclear many - body problem is represented by the so called molecular dynamics models .",
    "the point of view of these methods is some sense antithetic compared to the ones based on the mean - field concept .",
    "however also in these cases , due to their simplicity the same kind of phenomenological effective interactions skyrme and gogny are widely used .",
    "the starting point of all these models is a fundamental assumption on the wave function describing the single nucleon which is represented through a wave packet well localized in phase - space with uncertainty satisfying the uncertainty principle .",
    "the many - body wave fucntion can be expressed through a direct product , leading to the so called quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd)-like models @xcite or an anti - symmetrized product like in fmd and amd @xcite .",
    "variational principles have been used to obtain the equation of motion for the many - body wave functions . within their own approximation schemes these models",
    "treat the many - body problem without the usage of the mean - field approximation .",
    "many - body correlations are spontaneously produced and are able to describe the main features concerning the multi - breakup processes @xcite observed in heavy ion collision at intermediate energy and beyond . due to these deep conceptual differences between the mean - field based models and the molecular dynamics ones it becomes interesting , and necessary in our opinion , to investigate the differences between the energy - density functionals which are produced with these two classes of approaches when one uses , in both the cases , the same kind of effective elementary interaction between nucleons .",
    "the study presented in this work is performed by using the constraint molecular dynamical model comd @xcite , and the comparison will concern both the saturation properties of the symmetric nm and the properties of the symmetry energy obtained with a simple skyrme force . the study is limited to moderate values of the asymmetry parameter as the ones really encountered in nucleus - nucleus collisions . as it will be shown",
    "the presence of iso - vectorial forces strongly affects the results of this comparison ( see also @xcite ) . the work is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we illustrate the choice of the effective interaction and the related total energy functional are introduced . in sec.iii",
    "we describe the nm simulations .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "finally sec.v contains the summary and the concluding remarks .",
    "before illustrating with some detail the model and the nm simulations , in this section we briefly introduce the effective interaction which we use in our calculations .",
    "we also present the way in which the related total energy is obtained in the case of the semiclassical mean - field approximation ( se - mfa ) and in the case of the semiclassical - wave packet dynamics .",
    "the elementary interaction between two nucleons with spacial coordinates @xmath0,@xmath1 and third isospin component @xmath2,@xmath3 is of the skyrme type and has the following form : @xmath4 the first term of eq(1 ) represents the iso - scalar contribution to the two - body interaction , the second one is the usual 3-body effective interaction . for this term",
    "the @xmath5 density dependence is modeled through the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this term appears to be a generalization of the brink - voutherin @xcite three - body term corresponding to @xmath7 .",
    "this generalization is sustained both on the basis of phenomenological parametrization used in mean - field approaches @xcite and on more complex microscopic calculations based on g matrix calculations with realistic interactions .",
    "the third term represents instead the iso - vectorial contribution .",
    "the form factors @xmath8 have the following expression : @xmath9 @xmath10 is the saturation density value .",
    "also in this case the @xmath11 form factors are introduced to reproduce the results of more complex microscopic calculations based on realistic interaction concerning the symmetry energy and reflecting effects beyond the two - body interaction @xcite .",
    "these form factors have been widely used in hartree - fock calculations , in semiclassical buu calculations and in several molecular dynamcs models . in particular , @xmath12 will be used in the limit @xmath13 to perform calculations with stiffness parameter @xmath14 different from the ones related to the others form factors ( in the same limit @xmath15 correspond to @xmath14 values 1.5 , 1 and 0.5 respectively ) .",
    "finally we observe that for simplicity reason we do not add to this interaction non local effects . regarding this assumption",
    "we also note that some of the suggested skyrme parametrizations have a vanishing or very small terms related to the non locality at the saturation density in the limit of nuclear matter ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , as it will be shown in the following , in comd calculations the effective potential which determines the effective force able to govern the motion of the wave packets centroid is already non - local ( sum of gaussian contributions depending on the intra nucleons distances ) .",
    "it in fact represents the result of the convolution of the well localized wave packets with @xmath16 function in space . even if well - known , we shortly recall in the next section the main ingredients of the se - mfa .",
    "we think this section useful to present in the following the way in which this assumption is instead broken in the semiclassical wave - packets dynamics .      at a fixed time starting from eq.(1 ) ( we are considering here a stationary problem ) , in a rather general way , we can obtain the expression for the total energy @xmath17 related to the potential interaction by folding the elementary interaction with the two - body density distribution in phase - space @xmath18 . by taking into account the usual truncation condition on @xmath19 typical of the mean - field approximation",
    ", we can write : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the one - body distribution .",
    "therefore by using eq.(1 ) for @xmath17 we get : @xmath22 taking in to account that by definition @xmath23 we obtain : @xmath24 @xmath25 appear to be the energy density associated to the potential energy from which we can obtain the related binding energy per nucleon due to the potential interaction @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 represents the charge / mass asymmetry parameter evaluated from the neutron and proton density @xmath29 respectively .",
    "the total binding energy @xmath30 is obtained by adding the kinetic contribution coming from the fermi motion @xmath31\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xmath32 , @xmath33 terms of order greater than two are neglected . in particular",
    "we see how the iso - vectorial vectorial forces with strength proportional to @xmath34 contribute to the symmetry energy @xmath35 depending on the asymmetry parameter @xmath33 . for quadratic form in @xmath33",
    "we get : @xmath36 @xmath37 the common accepted bulk value of @xmath38 at the saturation density is about 30 mev even if relativistic hartree - fock models can predict higher values up to about 40 mev @xcite .",
    "however , still under study is the density dependence of this quantity which is able to affect neutron - skin thickness in nuclei and giant monopole resonances @xcite .",
    "finally we note that the structure of the obtained energy - density functional in se - mfa makes independent the choice of the parameter values describing the symmetry energy from the other ones which instead are fixed from the saturation properties of the symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "we will show in the next section that this is no longer true in the comd approach .      in molecular dynamics",
    "approaches a basic assumption is done on the wave functions describing the nucleonic degree of freedom .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the wave function is a gaussian wave packet with fixed width @xmath39 in coordinate space .",
    "the centroid in phase - space is indicated with @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42\\ ] ] the wigner transform of @xmath43 is @xmath44\\ ] ] the widths in momentum and space satisfy the minimum uncertainty principle condition @xmath45 .",
    "another assumption concerns the n - body wigner distribution which in comd model @xcite(like in qmd approach@xcite ) is a direct product of the single particle distributions . in this case therefore for a system formed by a nucleons the one - body and 2-body distributions above introduced have a multi - component structure that is : @xmath46 from the above relations we can see that in general @xmath47 . in particular , for the case in which these distributions are expressed as a sum of different localized components inside a volume @xmath48 , we can indicate with @xmath49 the number of components which give non negligible contributions in @xmath48 .",
    "the relative difference associated to eq.(18 ) @xmath50 can be estimated to be of the order of @xmath51 which corresponds to the ratio between diagonal ( @xmath52 ) and off - diagonal elements ( @xmath53 within the ensemble of @xmath54 terms . in semiclassical mean - field models",
    "@xmath49 can be enough high to make the difference negligible , in fact the single particle distribution usually spreads over the whole system ( test particles methods ) and therefore the truncation condition eq.(18 ) can be retained valid @xcite . on the contrary",
    "this is not surely the case for the molecular dynamics approaches for which the typical spreading volume if of the order of 2 - 10 @xmath55 . localization and therefore coherence of",
    "the wave - packed used to describe the single - particle wave - functions allows to keep memory of the two - body nature of the inter - particles interaction , and at same time , allows for the spontaneous appearance of the clustering phenomena in simulations concerning low - density excited portion of nuclear matter . with these assumptions on the 2-body phase - space distribution , taking in to account the properties of the @xmath16 function , we can obtain the explicity expression for the different terms concerning the total energy ; for the two - body isoscalar contribution @xmath56 we get : @xmath57\\\\ w_{twb}&=&\\frac{t_{0}}{2\\rho_{0}}\\sum_{i=1}^{a}s_{v}^{i}\\\\ s_{v}^{i}&= & \\sum_{j\\neq i=1}^{a}\\frac{1}{(4\\pi\\sigma_{r}^{2})^{3/2}}exp[-\\frac{(\\mathbf{r}_{i}-\\mathbf{r}_{j})^{2}}{4\\sigma_{r}^{2}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above expression @xmath58 is the normalized sum of the gaussian terms and it represents just a measure of the overlap between the nucleonic wave - packets .",
    "its two body character is quite explicit . in the calulations concerning the nm simulation that we will illustrate in the next sections ,",
    "the large number of particles @xmath59 involved in the system allow us to write the above quantity in a simpler way by introdcing the average overlap per nucleon @xmath60 whose dependence on the particle index in the ideal case can be omitted : @xmath61 by comparing the expression obtained for @xmath62 in the two different appraches ( eq.(10 ) and eq.(23 ) ) we note a formal analogy where the variable @xmath5 is substituted by the overlapp integral @xmath63 per nucleon .",
    "we however observe that this analogy is only formal , this aspect will be discussed in some detail in the next subsection . concerning the three - body term , according to the evaluations reported in reference @xcite and taking in to account the previous obervations we get : @xmath64 for the term related to the iso - vectorial interaction and for the most simple case @xmath65 in the limit @xmath66 ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 represents the number of neutron and protons we obtain : @xmath69\\\\ \\tilde{\\rho}^{np}&=\\frac{1 } { ( 4\\pi\\sigma_{r}^{2})^{3/2}z^{2 } } \\sum_{i\\neq j\\in\\mathbb{z } } exp[-\\frac { ( \\mathbf{r}_{i}-\\mathbf{r}_{j})^{2}}{4\\sigma_{r}^{2}}]\\\\ \\tilde{\\rho}^{np}&=\\frac{1}{(4\\pi\\sigma_{r}^{2})^{3/2}2nz}\\sum_{i\\neq j\\in\\mathbb{nz } } exp[-\\frac { ( \\mathbf{r}_{i}-\\mathbf{r}_{j})^{2}}{4\\sigma_{r}^{2}}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 with @xmath71 equal to @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 represents the overlap integral per couples of neutrons , protons and neutron - proton .",
    "a more convenient form for the above expression is obtained by introducing the two followng quantities : @xmath75 taking into account that by definition @xmath76 and @xmath77 we get : @xmath78\\\\ e_{isv}^{c}&=\\frac{t_{4}}{2\\rho_{0}}f'_{k}(\\overline{s_{v}})\\tilde{\\rho}_{a}[(1+\\frac{\\alpha}{2})\\beta^{2}-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}]\\\\ e_{bias}&=-\\frac{t_{4}}{4\\rho_{0}}f'_{k}(\\overline{s_{v}})\\tilde{\\rho}_{a}\\alpha\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 .",
    "the expressions in eqs.(32,33 ) also contain a generalizzation to the cases in which we use the generic form factors @xmath80 . here",
    "@xmath80 keep the same functional form in @xmath63 using the formal analogy @xmath81 above discussed .    from eq.(32 ) we obtain that for @xmath82 ( as comd calculations predicts , see next sections ) the iso - vectorial force produces , beyond a modified term for the symmetry energy , also another term ( the second term ) which we name @xmath83 ( eq.(33 ) ) .",
    "the effect of this last term is not -",
    "negligible if compared to the balance of the different term appearing in the expression of the total energy .",
    "the correlation coefficient @xmath84 by definition ( see eq.(30 ) ) represents the difference in percentage of the overlap between the neutron - proton couples from the one related to the couples formed by homonym nucleons .",
    "it also depends on the strength of the iso - vectorial forces ( @xmath34 parameter ) .    finally , according to the general strategy characterizing the comd approach @xcite , the kinetic energy contribution @xmath85 is obtained in a self - consistent way through the numerical constraint .",
    "minimum energy configurations are obtained by applying the cooling - warming procedure coupled with the constraint on the occupation numbers related to the the single particle wave functions as required by the pauli principle .",
    "as an example in fig.1 we show @xmath86 for a symmetric systems containing 3500 particles at different densities .",

    "is well represented by a @xmath87 dependence typical for the fermionic systems .",
    "this is shown in the figure trough slight continuous lines .",
    "in particular ,",
    "the above mentioned density dependence well describe also the case of an interacting system of particles .",
    "in fact , as previously discussed , the average field regulating the related dynamics is defined ( see eqs.(22 - 33 ) over a rather large number of particles and it is performed after having included the two - body particle interaction . in the following",
    "( see section iii.1 ) we will represents the kinetic energy contribution through a @xmath87 density dependence best - fitting the model calculations .",
    "the average kinetic energy per nucleons @xmath88 is shown as a function of the reduced density @xmath89 for a symmetric system containing 3500 particles . in the panel ( a )",

    "as suggested from comd calculations ( see fig.2 ) , for an uniform many - body system at a fixed density we can introduce the probability @xmath95 to have a particle in the volume @xmath96 localized in @xmath97 and a second one in the volume @xmath98 localized in @xmath99 . due to the uniformity condition @xmath95 depend only on @xmath100 .",

    "non zero values of @xmath94 can be instead expected at relatively small distances due both to the interaction ( for an attractive interaction the positive sign must be considered in eq.(35 ) ) and to the symmetry of the many - body wave function for quantal systems of identical particles ( in the case of identical fermions we must consider the sign minus and @xmath103 ) . for a classical system of non interacting particles we have a vanishing correlation effect @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "for our aims , we need to evaluate a normalized probability @xmath106 in such a way : @xmath107 @xmath108 represents the volume in which the well localized correlation function @xmath94 is different from zero .",

    "the calculations are referred to a symmetric portion of nuclear matter consisting of a sphere containing 2000 nucleons at a density of about 0.17@xmath55 .",
    "the calculations include also the iso - vectorial potential energy ( @xmath117 mev in this example ) .",
    "the probability distributions have been estimated by taking in to account only couples of nucleons in which at least one of the two nucleons is localized inside a smaller sphere with a radius of 4 fm . in this way",
    "we can neglect surface effects on this quantity .",
    "the error bars indicates the uncertainty related to the statistics of the simulations .",
    "we remark that in all the calculations concerning the present work in the range of density explored no cluster formation has been detected by our numerical procedure which was applied at each time step to check for the existence of aggregation processes . only in the lower limit @xmath118 and for only part of the time , the formation of a big cluster with a mass about 98 % the total one and light particles have been observed . from the figure",
    "it is clearly seen the depletion of the @xmath114 distribution at small distances due to pauli constraining in comd . for the other distributions",
    "an enhancement is produced due to the attractive effect of the two - body interaction .",
    "in particular we note that this enhancement is more pronounced for @xmath116 as compared to @xmath115 ; this is clearly an effect due to the iso - vectorial forces which generate a stronger attraction for neutron - proton couples .    now from eq.(35 ) we can obtain an expression for @xmath63 as : @xmath119dv\\\\   & \\quad = \\rho(1\\pm i )   \\end{split}\\ ] ] @xmath120\\nu(r)dr\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the above equations we see that even if the overlap integral per nucleon is closely related to the density @xmath5 , it admits correction terms related to the spacial correlation through the integral @xmath121 . in general , for function @xmath122 localized within a distance of the order of @xmath123 the value of @xmath121 decreases with the ratio @xmath124 : for example , for an exponential profile @xmath125 the correction terms go to zero like @xmath126 .",
    "in other words , according to what observed in the previous section , when the single particles space distribution is enough large , an averaging of the spacial correlations effect is obtained and the comd functional tends to the one represented in eq.(10 ) which is typical of the semi - classical mean - field approximation in transport theory . on the contrary for well localized wave - packets with @xmath39 of the order of 1 - 2 @xmath127",

    "they determine both the corrections on the pressure and on the compressibility due to the iso - vectorial forces . in fig.12",
    ", we plot for different values of the @xmath14 parameter as indicated with numbers in the panel , the values of @xmath199 versus @xmath200 ( black lines ) .",
    "the lines in the bottom panel represent the corresponding values in the case of se - mfa .",
    "10 pt as we can see the largest changes are observed in @xmath199 .",
    "these changes reflect the behavior as a function of density of the primary quantities @xmath63 , @xmath202 and @xmath84 appearing in the expression which determine the behavior of @xmath203 ( see eq.(32 ) ) . the density dependence of these quantities which contains the correlation effects discussed in sec.ii have indeed finite and positive values of the curvature around @xmath10 as can be seen by looking at fig.4 .",
    "this behavior , on turn , derives from the characteristic way in which the overlap between the wave - packets ( gaussian in our case ) changes with the density and therefore is strictly linked with the shape of the wave functions used to describe the single nucleons .",
    "many - body correlations produced in molecular dynamics approach based on the comd model have been discussed and their connection with the used effective interaction have been analyzed in the case of asymmetric nuclear matter simulations .",
    "this study has been performed by comparing the results obtained for the total energy functional , and the nm main saturation properties with the ones obtainable in the case of a semiclassical mean field approximations ( se - mfa ) .",
    "this comparison has been performed by using the same kind of simple effective skyrme interaction .",
    "while we can expect the two approaches to produce large differences at low density due to the cluster formation process , the following study shows that noticeable differences are obtained also in a narrow range of densities around the saturation one where no cluster production has been observed .",
    "the effective skyrme interaction include two - body and three - body effective iso - scalar interactions plus a two - body iso - vectorial one with form factors commonly used also in se - mfa . in comd calculations",
    "the effects related to the spacial correlations produced by the usage of the localized wave - packets and the ones related to the multi - particles correlations produced through the pauli principle constraint have been expressed through a second order polynomial decomposition of the total energy as a function of the density .",
    "the obtained results show that , contrary to the case of the se - mfa , the discussed correlations produce an interdependence between parameters describing the iso - scalar forces and the ones related to the iso - vectorial interaction .",
    "the usage of an iterative procedure tuned to obtain in both the cases ( se - mfa and in comd approaches ) very similar saturation density , total energy and compressibility for symmetric nm ( fixed to commonly accepted values ) allowed to extract a `` good '' set of parameters used for comd calculations .",
    "the value obtained differs under many aspects from the ones obtained from the se - mfa : in particular the density dependence of the used form factors describing the iso - vectorial forces can change now in rather more restricted range of stiffness values to reproduce the above nm properties .",
    "moreover , the values of the coefficients describing the iso - scalar interactions are rather different in the two cases . for asymmetric nm , in the range of the investigated asymmetry parameters ( @xmath204 , by using the same strength for the iso - vectorial interaction , the values of the obtained symmetry energies around the saturation density are only slightly different , but rather large differences are instead obtained for the slope @xmath200 and especially for the @xmath199 curvature parameters . in comd calculations @xmath199 assume in fact r higher values .",
    "this result can be attributed to the shape of the single particle wave - packets which determines the behavior of the average overlap per nucleon as a function of the density .",
    "finally we conclude by observing that even if from a numerical point of view the obtained results are strictly valid for the comd model , the performed study shows that the observed differences in the parameter values describing the effective interaction can have a more wide meaning .",
    "in fact , they are strictly linked to some general properties of the semiclassical wave packets dynamics .",
