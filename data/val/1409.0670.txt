    "logarithmic conformal field theory typically refers to a two - dimensional conformally invariant quantum field theory for which there exist correlation functions exhibiting logarithmic singularities .",
    "the first study of a logarithmic conformal field theory appears to be that of rozansky and saleur @xcite where the model under consideration possesses symmetries that include the affine kac - moody superalgebra @xmath0 of central charge @xmath1 . shortly thereafter , gurarie noted @xcite the appearance of logarithmic singularities in the @xmath2 fermionic ghost system and showed that a sufficient condition for their presence was the non - diagonalisability of the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "( he also seems to be responsible for the appellation `` logarithmic conformal field theory '' . )",
    "we refer to @xcite for a recent collection of reviews on this topic .    as with rational conformal field theory ,",
    "much of the analysis of logarithmic theories begins with identifying the physically relevant spectrum of representations of the chiral symmetry algebra ( vertex operator algebra ) .",
    "unlike the rational case , where the representations are all completely reducible , the spectrum of a logarithmic theory necessarily includes representations which are reducible , yet indecomposable .",
    "in particular , the eigenvectors of @xmath4 always span a subrepresentation which will be proper when @xmath4 has non - trivial jordan blocks .",
    "whilst the failure of complete reducibility does not by itself guarantee jordan blocks , hence logarithmic singularities , it seems that all the known conformal field theories whose spectrum includes reducible but indecomposable representations are logarithmic .",
    "moreover , being logarithmic seems to be a generic property for conformal field theories , rather than a pathological one .    in both the rational and logarithmic cases , the issue of deciding whether a given spectrum of vertex operator algebra representations is physically relevant or not deserves comment . in any physical application",
    ", this would hopefully be clear .",
    "we will , however , also use the term `` physically relevant '' in an abstract setting to describe mathematical objects or structures that satisfy certain conditions that one would expect to hold from a field - theoretic perspective .",
    "in particular , a physically relevant spectrum of representations ( category of modules ) must be closed under conjugation , to guarantee non - degenerate two - point functions , and fusion , to guarantee closure under operator product expansions .",
    "moreover , one must be able to form modular invariant partition functions from the characters .",
    "it is important to note , however , that logarithmic conformal field theories are necessarily non - unitary .",
    "this is not a concern for applications to statistical mechanics where the unitarity of a given lattice model is of little importance to the study of its phase transitions .",
    "examples of lattice models whose scaling limits are known , or are believed , to be described by logarithmic conformal field theories include :    * critical dense polymers @xcite , where the chiral symmetry is virasoro ( or symplectic fermions @xcite ) with @xmath2 .",
    "* critical percolation @xcite , where the symmetry is virasoro with @xmath1 . *",
    "abelian sandpiles @xcite , where the symmetry is again virasoro with @xmath2 , but the theory appears to differ from critical dense polymers . *",
    "the @xmath5 spin chain @xcite , where the symmetry is symplectic fermions with @xmath2 .",
    "non - unitarity is , of course , a concern for string - theoretic applications , but here we note that it is not the underlying conformal field theory , but only what survives the brst quantisation ( gauge - fixing ) that needs to be unitary",
    ". logarithmic theories relevant to string theory include :    * fermionic ( @xmath6 ) ghosts or symplectic fermions @xcite , where the chiral symmetry algebra is the affine kac - moody superalgebra @xmath7 with @xmath2 . * bosonic ( @xmath8 ) ghosts of central charge @xmath9 @xcite and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "* wess - zumino - witten models on lie supergroups and their coset superspaces @xcite .",
    "there are also logarithmic conformal field theories that have been extensively studied for their own sake , in particular the @xmath11 triplet models @xcite ( see @xcite for a proposed lattice - theoretic realisation ) , their @xmath12 generalisations @xcite , also known as the ( w - extended ) logarithmic minimal models , and the fractional level wess - zumino - witten models with @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite symmetry .",
    "recently , these models have been extended to @xmath13 triplets @xcite .",
    "the mathematical formalism of rational conformal field theory is very rich and it is natural to try to extend the key insights to the logarithmic case . in particular , the determination of the fusion rules in rational theories is often significantly simplified through the use of the verlinde formula @xcite .",
    "this relies on computing the modular s - transformations of the characters of the irreducible representations assuming , of course , that amenable character formulae can be found .",
    "unfortunately , it has been known for quite some time now @xcite that the irreducible characters of a logarithmic conformal field theory need not carry a representation of the modular group , an observation which appears to completely invalidate the application of any verlinde - type formula .",
    "an example illustrating this dilemma is the @xmath15 triplet model @xcite whose central charge is @xmath2 . in this model , there are four irreducible representations , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , labelled by the conformal dimensions of their highest weight states .",

    "in particular , miyamoto showed @xcite that one is only guaranteed to have an action of the modular group on the space of torus amplitudes ( one - point functions on the torus ) .",
    "characters are examples of these amplitudes , as is the function @xmath25 of , so miyamoto s result meshes nicely with the extended character space of the @xmath15 triplet model .",
    "however , the proof requires generalising the notion of torus amplitude ( and hence character ) to insert arbitrary elements of the chiral symmetry algebra into the trace .",
    "while no additional elements were needed in the case of the @xmath15 triplet model , it is not clear whether this will be true more generally .",
    "if not , then evaluating these refined characters and torus amplitudes leads to severe computational difficulties in all but the simplest examples .",
    "it also leaves one wondering how such a result helps in determining modular invariant bulk partition functions ( which are , after all , sesquilinear combinations of characters ) .    finding modular invariants",
    "therefore seems to require new insight @xcite , but one can instead ask a different question . given a logarithmic conformal field theory , is there a variant of the verlinde formula which can be used to compute the fusion rules efficiently ?",
    "the technical answer to this question is `` no '' , as long as we assume that the input to the verlinde formula is the s - transformation of characters , because characters can not distinguish between a representation and the direct sum of its irreducible constituents ( composition factors ) .",
    "instead , the best that we can hope for is a verlinde - type formula that determines the _ grothendieck _ fusion rules that are obtained from the genuine fusion rules by identifying representations with the same character .",
    "is there a verlinde formula that computes the grothendieck fusion rules ? for the @xmath11 triplet models ,",
    "the answer is `` yes '' @xcite . here",
    ", one computes the modular s - matrix @xmath26 on the basis of irreducible characters directly , so that the entries are @xmath22-dependent in general .",
    "but then , the action is twisted by a carefully chosen @xmath22-dependent automorphy factor @xmath27 such that the product @xmath28 is both independent of @xmath22 and , with @xmath29 , defines a representation of the modular group on character space .",
    "remarkably , this matrix @xmath30 successfully block - diagonalises the grothendieck fusion rules in a verlinde - type formula given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "most importantly , the entries of the block - diagonal matrix are also expressed in terms of the entries of @xmath30 .",
    "admittedly , this formula is rather more complicated than the verlinde formula of rational conformal field theory .",
    "however , this is to be expected from the non - diagonalisability of the fusion matrices in the logarithmic case .",
    "but , there seems to be little understanding of why twisting by this automorphy factor @xmath27 is required , whether there are other possibilities for @xmath27 , and whether , for more general models , the existence of such a factor is always guaranteed .",
    "as far as we are aware , this type of verlinde formula has not been generalised beyond the @xmath11 triplet models",
    ". moreover , there are now several other proposals @xcite addressing seemingly different verlinde formulae for these theories .    rather than try to compare and contrast these proposals , which would be a worthy goal in itself , we shall instead turn to a rather different formalism which has recently been introduced @xcite for modular properties and verlinde formulae in a more general class of logarithmic conformal field theories .",
    "one difference between this proposal and those mentioned above is that it does not directly apply to the triplet models .",
    "however , this is not a serious restriction because the triplet models have close relatives to which the new formalism does apply .",
    "we shall explain how this allows us to compute grothendieck fusion rules for the triplet models in section  [ sec : simpcurrext ] .",
    "the formalism discussed in this section arises from the observation @xcite that the majority of the logarithmic conformal field theories that have been adequately analysed to date all share certain key features .",
    "moreover , the known exceptions may all be understood as simple current extensions of theories with the desired features .",
    "we will therefore describe these features before explaining , with the aid of examples , how they allow one to straightforwardly compute modular transformations and apply the verlinde formula to obtain grothendieck fusion coefficients .",
    "the formalism centres @xcite about the identification of a collection of representations of the chiral algebra ( vertex operator algebra ) that we call the _",
    "standard modules_. these standard modules and their characters should have the following properties :    1 .",
    "the characters of the standard modules are parametrised by a measurable space @xmath31 .",
    "[ it : meas ] 2 .",
    "the irreducible standard modules are called _",
    "typical_. the complement of the subset of @xmath32 corresponding to the typical characters has measure zero with respect to @xmath33 .",

    "the only indecomposable module in the spectrum having a typical module ( irreducible standard ) as a composition factor ( irreducible subquotient ) is that typical module . [",

    ", the s - transformation defines a symmetric , unitary operator whose square may be identified with conjugation . [",
    "it : s ] 6 .   combining the s - transformation with the standard verlinde formula leads to the grothendieck fusion rules ( with non - negative integer coefficients ) .",
    "[ it : ver ]    any module in the spectrum that is not a direct sum of typical modules is called _ atypical _ , the nomenclature here being inspired by that of kac for lie superalgebra representations .",
    "we remark that there will usually be more than one inequivalent standard module for each atypical parameter @xmath35 , but each of these atypical standard modules will have the same character .",
    "we will not give any general means for identifying the standard modules in a given theory beyond the obvious need to satisfy the above requirements ; in examples , this identification is often clear . in this vein",
    ", we mention that verifying [ it : proj ] rigorously is almost always too difficult at present , so we usually have to content ourselves with conjecturing that it holds .",
    "we also remark that [ it : res ] is generally seen to be satisfied by the existence of resolutions for the irreducible atypical modules in terms of atypical standard modules .",
    "the euler - poincar principle then expresses the character of each irreducible as an ( infinite ) alternating sum of standard characters .",
    "the main observation that we want to emphasise is that the typical modules behave , for all intents and purposes , as if they were in a rational conformal field theory .",
    "indeed , rational theories fit into the above formalism as the special case in which all the standard modules are typical .",
    "the logarithmic nature of the theory is therefore concentrated in the atypical modules and these are required to form a set of measure zero in character - space .",
    "this means that , heuristically at least , any potential problems that the logarithmic structure would create are measure - theoretically void .",
    "while there is an open question as to how one identifies the appropriate measure in general , we will see that in examples , the natural choice works .    the simplest ( non - rational ) example illustrating this formalism is the ( uncompactified ) free boson .",

    "the takiff model is of interest because it demonstrates that the formalism can naturally accommodate different degrees of atypicality .",
    "the singlet theories with @xmath102 are interesting because it is known @xcite that their fusion product does not induce a well - defined product on the grothendieck group because of the poor behaviour ( non - rigidity ) of the minimal model representations",
    ". the formalism deals with this naturally , and rather effectively , by regarding the minimal model characters as being zero .",
    "we recall that a simple current may be generally defined as an indecomposable representation for which fusing with the simple current defines a permutation on the set of all indecomposables . for the purposes of this article",
    ", we shall simplify this definition by replacing `` indecomposable '' by `` irreducible '' , as in @xcite .",
    "examples of such simple currents then include the @xmath103 , with @xmath49 , for the @xmath15 singlet model ( example  [ ex : sing ] ) and the @xmath74 , with @xmath75 , for the @xmath10 bosonic ghost system ( example  [ ex : ghost ] ) . in both cases ,",
    "the simple currents are atypical irreducibles .",
    "if the vacuum module is also irreducible , as is the case for both examples considered in section  [ sec : modlcft ] , then for every simple current @xmath104 , there exists a simple current @xmath105 such that their fusion gives the vacuum module , that is , @xmath104 has a fusion inverse .",
    "any given simple current ( more generally , any set of simple currents ) then generates a group @xmath106 of simple currents under the fusion operation .",
    "this group then generates an extended symmetry algebra in the sense that the representation @xmath107 carries the structure of a vertex operator algebra .",
    "moreover , every representation @xmath108 of the original symmetry algebra determines a representation of the extended symmetry algebra on @xmath109 .",
    "mathematically , this may be formalised using the notions of restriction and induction @xcite : let @xmath27 denote the original vertex operator algebra , @xmath110 its simple current extension by @xmath106 , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 their fusion products .",
    "then , restricting @xmath110 ( interpreted as its vacuum module ) to an @xmath27-module and inducing @xmath27 ( also interpreted as its vacuum module ) to a @xmath110-module amounts to @xmath113 moreover , we may induce an @xmath27-module @xmath108 to a @xmath110-module @xmath114 , obtaining @xmath115 as before .",
    "this formalisation has a practical benefit as well .",
    "the associativity of fusion products allows one to compute the fusion rules for the simple current extension @xmath110 from those of @xmath27 : @xmath116 here , we remark that inducing an irreducible @xmath27-module @xmath108 results in an irreducible @xmath110-module @xmath114 .",
    "this is a special property of ( invertible ) simple current extensions that follows from because each direct summand @xmath117 is an irreducible that is obtained from any other direct summand by acting with one of the simple currents in @xmath106 , thus with an element of @xmath110 .",
    "we remark that , for simplicity and because our examples do not require it , we are ignoring the issue of _ fixed points _ here , see @xcite .",
    "of course , one needs to justify why the fusion product of a vertex operator algebra may be regarded as a tensor product that is permeable to the algebra action . that fusion constitutes an abstract tensor product is , at least for @xmath118-cofinite vertex operator algebras , one of the great results of lepowsky s group ( see @xcite for a review ) . while the logarithmic theories we study here are not @xmath118-cofinite in general , it is very reasonable to assume that fusion still has the properties of a tensor product on the physical category of representations .",
    "the permeability , on the other hand , reflects the locality requirement for fields corresponding to the algebra and its modules .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath119 is a field of @xmath27 and @xmath120 and @xmath121 are fields corresponding to elements of the @xmath27-modules @xmath108 and @xmath122 , respectively , then locality and associativity give @xmath123    we conclude by computing the grothendieck fusion rules of the @xmath15 triplet model as an application of this simple current formalism .",
    "recall from equation   that the irreducible characters do not span a representation of the modular group . from the point of view of the modular formalism of section  [ sec : modlcft ]",
    ", one identifies candidates for the standard modules : the typical irreducibles @xmath18 and @xmath19 and the atypical indecomposables @xmath124 and @xmath125 are characterised by @xmath126 unfortunately , the standard characters do not span a representation of the modular group either .",
    "we remark that as @xmath127 } } = { { \\mathrm{ch}}{\\bigl [ { \\mathbb{a}_{1 } } \\bigr]}}$ ] , the atypical characters have measure @xmath128 with respect to the natural measure ( counting measure ) on the parametrisation space @xmath129 .    as mentioned above , ( grothendieck ) fusion rules for the @xmath15 triplet model are nevertheless easily derived by regarding this theory as the simple current extension of the @xmath15 singlet model .",
    "the group @xmath106 of simple currents is generated by the irreducible singlet representation @xmath130 ( or @xmath131 ) @xcite whose highest weight state has conformal dimension @xmath39 .",
    "we can therefore apply the above simple current formalism with @xmath27 and @xmath110 being the singlet and triplet vertex operator algebras , respectively .",
    "it is straightforward to identify the triplet irreducibles as induced singlet modules ( see example  [ ex : sing ] ) : @xmath132 the remaining singlet typicals @xmath40 can likewise be induced , but they turn out to define _ twisted _ representations on which the triplet fields act with non - trivial monodromy .",
    "the singlet fusion rules derived in example  [ ex : sing ] may now be lifted to the triplet using .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath133    in the same manner , we compute @xmath134    these results agree of course with direct , though significantly more difficult , computations @xcite . for the fusion rules of @xmath18 and @xmath19 ,",
    "the corresponding singlet rules were only derived at the grothendieck level , so we may only conclude that @xmath135 } } \\otimes_{{\\mathsf{b } } } { { \\mathrm{ch}}{\\bigl [ { \\mathbb{l}_{h ' } } \\bigr ] } } = 2 \\ : { { \\mathrm{ch}}{\\bigl [ { \\mathbb{l}_{0 } } \\bigr ] } } + 2 \\ : { { \\mathrm{ch}}{\\bigl [ { \\mathbb{l}_{1 } } \\bigr ] } } , \\qquad \\text{(\\(h , h ' \\in { \\left\\ { -\\tfrac{1}{8 } , \\tfrac{3}{8 } \\right\\}}\\)).}\\ ] ] this result is also consistent with the known fusion rules @xcite where the fusion products are known to be indecomposable staggered modules formed by glueing two copies of @xmath16 and two copies of @xmath17 together .",
    "this example illustrates how one can combine the standard module formalism of section  [ sec : modlcft ] with the simple current formalism of section  [ sec : simpcurrext ] to rather effortlessly deduce the ( grothendieck ) fusion rules of logarithmic conformal field theories .",
    "the results have been generalised to all the @xmath12 triplet models @xcite and are in complete agreement with the fusion computations that have been computed , as well as those that have only been conjectured , for these theories .",
    "we conclude by remarking that we are unaware of theories to which this combined formalism can not be applied .",
    "it would be very interesting to study an example of such a theory .",
    "we thank jrgen fuchs and aliosha semikhatov for discussions on the verlinde formula for the @xmath11 triplet models , matthias gaberdiel for helpful correspondence concerning the modular properties of the triplet characters , and antun milas for pointing out a mistake in an earlier version .",
