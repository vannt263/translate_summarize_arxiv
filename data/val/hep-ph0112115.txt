    "it has been realized for a long time that rare b - meson decays induced by the flavor  changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are the most promising field for obtaining information about the fundamental parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , like the elements of the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa ( ckm ) matrix , the leptonic decay constants etc . , and testing the sm predictions at loop level . at the same time",
    "rare decays can also serve as a good probe for establishing new physics beyond the sm , such as the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) @xcite , etc .",
    ", since the contributions from these new models and the sm arise at the same order in perturbation theory .",
    "the observation of radiative penguin mediated processes , in both the exclusive @xmath10 @xcite and inclusive @xmath11 @xcite channels , stimulated the investigation of the radiative rare b meson decays with a new momentum . among these rare decays ,",
    "@xmath12 @xmath13 have received a special interest due to their relative cleanliness and sensitivity to new physics .",
    "they have been investigated in the framework of the sm for light and heavy lepton modes in refs.@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the new physics effects in these decays have also been studied in some models , like mssm @xcite and the two higgs doublet model @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we study the radiative @xmath14 decay in the general two - higgs doublet model ( model iii ) including the neutral higgs effects .",
    "the 2hdm is the minimal extension of the sm , which consists of adding a second doublet to the higgs sector . in this model ,",
    "the yukawa lagrangian responsible for the interaction of quarks and leptons with gauge bosons opens up the possibility of having tree - level fcnc , which are forbidden in the sm and model i and ii types of the 2hdm .",
    "this brings new parameters , i.e. , yukawa couplings , into the theory .",
    "@xmath15 decay is induced by the pure - leptonic decay @xmath16 , which is free from the helicity suppression , in contrast to the channels with light leptons , but quite hard to detect experimentally due to low efficiency . in @xmath17 decay ,",
    "helicity suppression is overcome by the photon emission in addition to the lepton pair .",
    "for this reason , it is expected for @xmath18 decay to have a large branching ratio and this makes its investigation interesting .",
    "another reason that motivates to study @xmath15 process is that it receives additional contributions from the neutral higgs boson ( nhb ) exchanges in the 2hdm .",
    "since nhb contributions are proportional to either the lepton mass or the corresponding yukawa coupling , they are negligible for @xmath19 decays with light leptons , but we could expect significant contributions for @xmath20 . indeed , the investigation of @xmath21 decay in model i and ii types of the 2hdm in @xcite , and in mssm in @xcite , including nhb effects report that the contribution from exchanging neutral higgs bosons may be quite sizable for large values of @xmath22 , which is already favored by lep experiments @xcite .",
    "we investigated the @xmath23 decay for @xmath24 in the model iii type of the 2hdm in a previous paper @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend this study with an emphasis on possible cp violation effects .",
    "the cp asymmetry is of great interest in high energy physics especially since its origin is still unclear . in the sm ,",
    "the source of cp violation is the complex ckm matrix elements , which can explain all the existing data on cp violation .",
    "however , for example , to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in the universe today one needs additional sources of cp violating effects , which has motivated to search new models beyond the sm . in model iii type of the 2hdm ,",
    "the complex yukawa couplings provide a possible source of cp violation .",
    "indeed , it was reported @xcite-@xcite that a measurable cp aysmmetry was obtained due to this new phase in the model iii .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s2 ] , we first present the leading order ( lo ) qcd corrected effective hamiltonian for the quark level process @xmath25 , including the nhb exchanges .",
    "then we give the corresponding matrix element for the exclusive @xmath15 decay .",
    "next , we calculate the the forward - backward asymmetry of the lepton pair , @xmath1 , cp - violating asymmetry , @xmath2 , and the cp - violating asymmetry in forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath3 , as functions of the model parameters .",
    "section [ s3 ] is devoted to the numerical analysis of these physical quantities with respect to the cp parameter @xmath26 , yukawa couplings @xmath9 and @xmath8 and the mass ratio @xmath27 and to the discussion of our results . in appendix",
    "a , we give a brief summary about the general 2hdm ( model iii ) .",
    "the operators and the corresponding wilson coeffients appearing in the effective hamiltonian are given in appendices b and c , respectively .",
    "finally , some parametrizations used in the text may be found in appendix d.",
    "the exclusive @xmath15 decay is induced by the inclusive @xmath28 one .",
    "therefore , we start with the qcd corrected effective hamiltonian for the related quark level process @xmath29 , which is obtained by integrating out heavy particles in the sm and in the 2hdm @xcite = v_tb v_ts^ * _ i = 1 ^ 10 c_i ( ) o_i()+ _ i = 1 ^ 10 c_q_i()q_i ( ) , [ h1 ] where @xmath30 are current - current @xmath31 , penguin @xmath32 , magnetic penguin @xmath33 and semileptonic @xmath34 operators .",
    "the additional operators @xmath35 are due to the nhb exchange diagrams , which give considerable contributions in the case that the lepton pair is @xmath36 @xcite . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are wilson coefficients renormalized at the scale @xmath39 .",
    "all these operators and the wilson coefficients , together with their initial values calculated at @xmath40 in the sm and also the additional coefficients coming from the new higgs scalars are presented in appendices b and c.    neglecting the strange quark mass , the effective hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) leads to the following matrix element for @xmath29 , & = & v_tb v_ts^ * c_9^eff ( |s _ p_l b ) |_+ c_10 ( |s _ p_l b ) |__5 + & - & 2 c_7 ( |s i _ q_p_r b ) | _ + c_q_1(|s p_r b ) |+c_q_2(|s p_r b ) | _ 5  , where @xmath41 , @xmath42 is the momentum transfer and @xmath43 s are the corresponding elements of the ckm matrix .    in order to obtain the matrix element for @xmath44 decay",

    "when a photon is released from the initial quark lines it contributes to the so - called `` structure dependent '' ( sd ) part of the amplitude . using the expressions [ mel1 ] ( k ) |s _ ( 1 _ 5 ) b b(p_b ) & = & \\ { _ ^ q^k^g(q^2 ) i f(q^2 ) }  , |s i _",
