    "extreme events take place frequently in both nature and society . for instance , the recurrence of floods , droughts , earth quakes and economic recession are all examples of extreme events .",
    "the consequences of extreme events to life and property are often enormous and hence it is desirable to study their properties and questions related to their predictability .",
    "interestingly , all of these extreme events are also non - equilibrium phenomena and studying the extreme value statistics in them will lead to a better understanding of the models and the phenomenology of non - equilibrium statistical physics .",
    "thus , there is an increasing interest in the physics literature to understand a broad range of issues and phenomena connected with the occurance of extreme events and their dynamics @xcite .    in the classical extreme value theory ,",
    "the limiting distribution for the extreme maximal values in sequences of independent and identically distributed random variables can be one of the frchet , gumbel or weibull distribution depending on the behavior of the tail of the probability density @xcite .",
    "this has been empirically verified in many cases of practical interest .",
    "many new applications continue to be discovered , for example , the recent one being the distribution of extreme components of the eigenmodes of quantum chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the questions about the distribution of extrema , one of the problems being addressed in the last few years is the distribution of the returns intervals for the extreme events when the underlying time series displays long memory @xcite .",
    "this is primarily motivated by the fact that many of the natural and socio - economic phenomena , e.g. , daily temperature , dna sequences , river run - off , earth quakes , stock markets etc . ,",
    "display long memory or long range correlation @xcite .",
    "long memory implies slowly decaying auto correlation function of the power law type such that the system does not exhibit typical time scales . in this case , the intervals between extreme events are likely to be correlated as well . on the contrary",
    ", it is known that for an uncorrelated time series , intervals between extreme events are also uncorrelated and are exponentially distributed .",
    "the question is how the presence of long range correlation modifies the return interval distribution of extreme events ?",
    "a definite answer to this question would shed new light on many problems across various disciplines .",
    "return interval distributions are interesting and useful for several reasons , the most important being that many problems in diverse fields can be formulated in terms of return interval statistics with wide ranging applications .",
    "for instance , the problem of recurrence time interval between earthquakes above a given magnitude @xcite , x - ray solar flare recurrences @xcite , statistics of acoustic emission from rock fractures @xcite , inter arrival packet times on computer and cellular networks @xcite and the classical problem of poincare recurrences in hamiltonian systems @xcite can all be formulated as extreme event questions involving return interval distribution . in a non - stationary time series , it is often difficult to reliably estimate its temporal statistical properties such as the autocorrelations or higher order correlations . thus , return interval distributions are also a useful tool to characterize temporal properties of such systems .",
    "let @xmath0 denote a sequence of random variable , where @xmath1 is the time index .",
    "we will call an event extreme if @xmath2 where @xmath3 is some threshold value .",
    "the return interval @xmath4 is the time between successive occurance of extreme events . with respect to threshold @xmath3",
    ", we have a well - defined series of return intervals , @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "this is schematically shown in fig [ scheme ] .",
    "if the random variables @xmath0 are uncorrelated , then the return intervals @xmath5 are also uncorrelated and they are exponentially distributed as @xmath7 in order to use later , we also define the average return interval dependent on threshold @xmath3 to be @xmath8 in contrast to an uncorrelated time series , a long range correlated series has an autocorrelation function that displays power law of the form , @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the temporal average and @xmath11 is the auto correlation exponent . the work done in the last few years show that the long range correlation does indeed affect the return interval distribution of extreme events @xcite .",
    "empirical results in a series of papers @xcite have shown that , in the presence of long range correlation , the return interval distribution becomes a stretched exponential given by , @xmath12 with scaled return intervals being defined as @xmath13 . both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are constants that depend on @xmath11 .",
    "they can be fixed by normalizing both the probability and the average return interval to unity .",
    "it has also been shown that the return intervals themselves are long range correlated .",
    "as a function of time @xmath1.,width=226 ]    however , an analytical justification for the stretched exponential distribution in eq . [ rtd1 ] is still lacking and the main contribution of this paper is to partly fill this void . in this context , it must be noted that deviations from the stretched exponential distribution in eq .",
    "[ rtd1 ] have been noted for return intervals shorter ( @xmath16 ) than the average . for short return intervals , i.e , @xmath16",

    "[ rtd1 ] . while the return interval distribution is expected to depend on the threshold @xmath3",
    ", the stretched exponential form does not explicitly reveal this dependence .",
    "this paper addresses these questions using a combination of analytical and numerical results .",
    "firstly , from theoretical arguments , we obtain an approximate expression for the return interval distribution , which modifies eq .",
    "[ rtd1 ] from a purely stretched exponential form to a product of power law and stretched exponential .",
    "secondly , we systematically study the dependence of return interval distribution on the threshold @xmath3 and show that our analytical result holds good in the limit of @xmath18 .",
    "in general , the return interval distribution depends on the value of threshold @xmath3 .",
    "recently , in the study of global seismic activity above some magnitude @xmath19 , the distribution @xmath20 of recurrence times @xmath21 have been shown to follow a scaling ansatz of the form @xmath22 where the function @xmath23 is the gamma distribution @xcite .",
    "in fact , this scaling relation seems to hold good for forest fire occurance intervals @xcite , tsunami inter event times @xcite and ion channel currents in voltage dependent anion channels in the cell @xcite .",
    "the analytical distribution obtained in this paper might shed light on this scaling found in a variety of systems .",
    "in the next section , we obtain an analytical expression for the return interval distribution and in the subsequent section we present our numerical results .",
    "further , we systematically study the dependence of the return interval distribution on the threshold used to define the extreme event .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "the starting point of our approach is to transform the given long range correlated time series @xmath0 with autocorrelation exponent @xmath11 into a binary sequence with 1 at positions of extreme events and 0 elsewhere .",
    "thus , we obtain new binary sequence defined by , @xmath24 we use the empirical result that for a long range correlated time series with the autocorrelation exponent @xmath11 , the return intervals are also long range correlated with the same exponent .",
    "thus , our probability model is the statement that given an extreme event at time @xmath25 , the probability to find an extreme event at time @xmath26 is given by , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hurst exponent @xcite and @xmath29 is the normalization constant that will be fixed later . we have also used the well - known relation between hurst exponent and autocorrelation exponent ; @xmath30 .",
    "equation [ probmodel ] implies that after an extreme event it is highly probable to expect the next event to be an extreme one too ; and this is a reasonable proposition for a persistent time series .",
    "notice also that for an uncorrelated time series @xmath31 .",
    "this leads to @xmath32 in eq .",
    "[ probmodel ] becoming independent of @xmath4 , as would be expected for an uncorrelated time series .",
    "further support for this proposition comes from the theorem due to newell and rosenblatt @xcite obtained in the context of zero crossing probabilities for gaussian processes .",
    "it states that for a separable gaussian stationary process @xmath33 with mean @xmath34 , the probability @xmath35 that @xmath36 for @xmath37 is @xmath38 as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .",

    "[ logp ] can be dropped and the return interval distribution behaves essentially like a stretched exponential distribution , @xmath74 thus , stretched exponential is a good approximation for @xmath73 .",

    "this is also well documented in the literature as the conditional probability @xmath76 to find return interval @xmath72 , given that the previous return interval was @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "this conditional probability shows interesting features and deviates from the case of uncorrelated return intervals .",
    "equation [ rtd3 ] does not take into account these correlations among intervals and in fact is derived on the assumption that return intervals are independent .",
    "this is a gross approximation though in the absence any other definitive model for the correlations among intervals this is a simple and analytically tractable choice .",
    "based on this argument , one can expect eq .",

    "we expect that the functional form of the distribution in eq [ rtd4 ] would not be modified though the normalization constants @xmath89 and @xmath90 might change due to their dependence on the threshold @xmath3 .",
    "the question of verifying the results of this paper with a measured time series is underway and would be reported elsewhere .    as pointed out before , the inter - event time distribution has applications across many disciplines .",

    "the probability that @xmath135 for @xmath37 has been considered . under certain conditions , for a stationary gaussian process , the upper bound for zero crossing probability is shown to be a stretched exponential @xcite .",
    "this result does not strictly apply to the case of recurrence interval statistics because the zero crossing probability does not make statements about occurrence or non - occurance of another zero crossing after the interval @xmath136 .",
    "a return interval , by definition , requires two crossings separated by an interval with no crossings .",
    "finally , we would like to remark that the analytical distribution obtained in this paper appears to be related to the universal scaling form proposed recently @xcite in the context of earth quakes but appears to be more generally valid .",

    "<S> it is well known that many physical processes in nature and society display long range correlations . </S>",
    "<S> hence , in the last few years , considerable research effort has been directed towards studying the distribution of return intervals for long range correlated time series . based on numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , it was shown that the return interval distributions are of stretched exponential type . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an analytical expression for the distribution of return intervals in long range correlated time series which holds good when the average return intervals are large . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the distribution is actually a product of power law and a stretched exponential form . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss the regimes of validity and perform detailed studies on how the return interval distribution depends on the threshold used to define extreme events . </S>"
