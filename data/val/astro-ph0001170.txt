    "for long , the solar system has been the only location of the galaxy with a known fluorine ( @xmath0 ) abundance . at the same time , the production site(s ) of this element has been a major nucleosynthetic puzzle , even if f is the least abundant ( mass fraction of @xmath5 , following grevesse & sauval 1998 ) of the elements ranging from carbon to calcium .",
    "these last years , the situation has changed quite dramatically , both observationally and theoretically .",
    "fluorine overabundances ( with respect to solar ) in ms , s and c stars have been reported ( jorissen et al . 1992 ) , and correlate in particular with s - process enrichments .",
    "these observations demonstrate that thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars are fluorine producers , as predicted by goriely et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , and confirmed by calculations conducted in the framework of detailed agb models ( forestini et al 1992 , mowlavi et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "it remains of course to determine the exact level of the contribution of these ( mass losing ) stars to the solar system and galactic f content .    in direct relation with this question",
    ", various calculations have been made in order to estimate the @xmath0 yields from massive stars .",
    "the neutrino process operating during supernova explosions has been envisioned as a possible producer of primary @xmath0 ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1995 ) . on the other hand , meynet & arnould ( 1993a )",
    "have investigated on grounds of detailed stellar models the suggestion ( goriely et al .",
    "1989 ) that the hydrostatically burning he - shell can synthesize @xmath0 of secondary nature .",
    "they find that the level of production is relatively modest in @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , they show that stars which are massive enough to become wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars can eject through their winds substantial amounts of fluorine synthesized in the core at the beginning of the he - burning phase .    in the present work , we revisit the question of the galactic contribution of wr stars to @xmath0 with the help of new stellar models that better account for many important observable properties of wr stars .",
    "in addition , we extend the range of masses and metallicities considered in our previous study .",
    "the broadening of the explored metallicity range may take some additional importance in relation with the recent claim by timmes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) that `` _ positive detection of any fluorine at a sufficiently large redshift ( @xmath7 ) would suggest strongly a positive detection of the neutrino process operating in massive stars _ '' .",
    "the possibility of a significant thermonuclear production of @xmath0 by wr stars of different metallicities might blur this picture , and might at least imply the necessity of establishing observationally the primary or secondary nature of the detected fluorine , if any .",
    "the physical ingredients of the models are discussed in sect .  2 .",
    "section  3 presents our predicted yields from individual wr stars , while sect .",
    "4 gives a rough estimate of the contribution of wr stars to the galactic @xmath0 content .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in sect .",
    "the evolutionary models are computed with the same physical ingredients as in meynet et al .",
    "however , the adopted nuclear reaction network is extended , especially in order to include the reactions involved in the production and destruction of @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "the differences with respect to the computations of meynet & arnould ( 1993a ) are twofold :    \\1 ) a more extended range of initial masses ( from 25 to 120 @xmath2 ) and metallicities ( @xmath3 , 0.02 and 0.04 ) is explored ;    \\2 ) the present grid of models is computed with the mass loss rates adopted by meynet et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which are twice as large as the values of @xmath8 recommended by de jager et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and conti ( 1988 ) for the pre - wr and wnl phases .",
    "this mass loss rate prescription enables to account for the observed variations of wr populations in different environments ( maeder & meynet 1994 ) .",
    "the metallicity dependence of the mass loss rates during the pre - wr phases is adopted from previous works ( e.g. meynet et al .",
    "more specifically , @xmath8 scales with metallicity @xmath9 according to @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the solar metallicity .",
    "this scaling is deduced from stellar wind models ( cf .",
    "kudritzki et al .",
    "1987 , 1991 ) .",
    "let us finally add that the models are computed with a moderate core overshooting ( @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the overshooting distance and @xmath14 the pressure scale height at the boundary of the classical core ) .",
    "the cno mode of h - burning is responsible for the production and destruction of @xmath0 through the reaction chain    @xmath15",
    "@xmath16    the adopted @xmath17 rate is the geometrical mean of the lower and upper limits to that rate proposed by kious ( 1990 ) .",
    "fluorine can also be produced and destroyed during he - burning through the chains ( see also meynet & arnould 1993a ) @xmath18    the synthesis of @xmath0 thus requires the availability of neutrons and protons .",
    "they are mainly produced by the reactions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the first chain of transformation of @xmath1 into @xmath0 mentioned above is by far the most important in the conditions of relevance in this work , where the @xmath21-decay lifetime @xmath22(@xmath23 ) of @xmath23 is much shorter than its lifetime @xmath24(@xmath23 ) or @xmath25(@xmath23 ) against ( @xmath26 ) or ( @xmath27 ) reactions .",
    "for example , @xmath22 is a few hours only at the center of a 60 m@xmath4 model at the beginning of core he - burning , while the corresponding @xmath24(@xmath23 ) and @xmath25(@xmath23 ) amount to about 1  400 and 18  000 years , respectively .    the nacre compilation of reaction rates ( angulo et al .",
    "1999 ) was not available yet at the time of completion of the calculations reported here .",
    "this is why most of the necessary nuclear data are taken from caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) .",
    "there are some exceptions to this rule .",
    "in particular , the @xmath28 @xmath29-capture rate is taken from descouvemont ( 1987 ) , whose theoretical prediction of an increase of the astrophysical s - factor at low energies is confirmed experimentally ( see nacre ) .",
    "the @xmath20 rate is taken from brehm et al .",
    "it is a factor of two lower than the one proposed by koehler and obrien ( 1989 ) , and leads consequently to a _",
    "lower limit _ of the calculated @xmath0 yields .",
    "as discussed by arnould et al . ( 1999 ) on grounds of the nacre rates , @xmath0 could be overproduced ( with respect to solar ) by the cno cycle only at temperatures around @xmath31 k , the exact level of this overproduction remaining poorly predictable , however , in view of remaining rate uncertainties .",
    "this conclusion contradicts the one derived from the use of the rates recommended by caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) , in which case fluorine can never emerge in significant amounts from the cno burning .",
    "as the latter rates are adopted in our calculations , the cno zones of the computed model stars are depleted in @xmath0 .",
    "this translates directly into a decrease of the @xmath0 mass fraction @xmath32 at the stellar surfaces when the @xmath0-depleted cno ashes are uncovered by mass loss ( with the choice of the ordinate scales , the changes of fluorine abundance at the center and at the surface during the h - burning phase are not visible on fig .  1 ) .",
    "with the nacre rates , it is expected that more @xmath0 would be present at the surface .",
    "however , it is also likely that this change is not able to affect drastically the predicted final yields , as these are dominated by the @xmath0 made during the he - burning phase .    in fact , as seen in fig .  1",
    ", fluorine builds up through @xmath33 during the early phase of core he - burning .",
    "however , at the end of he - burning , @xmath34 is responsible for a significant @xmath0 destruction .",
    "thus , material experiencing the whole he - burning episode can not be @xmath0-enriched . _",
    "in contrast , in massive stars going through the wr stage _ ( initial mass @xmath35 for @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath3 ; see maeder & meynet 1994 ) , _",
    "some @xmath38 synthesized early during the core he - burning phase is ejected into the interstellar medium by stellar winds before its destruction_. indeed , fig .",
    "1 exhibits an increase of @xmath39 when the he - burning products appear at the surface during the wc phase . as a result , the ratio @xmath40 of the average @xmath0 surface mass fraction during the whole wc phase to the solar system @xmath0 mass fraction takes values as high as about 55 , 95 and 60 in the case of the @xmath41 model stars with @xmath42 , 0.02 and 0.04 , respectively .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath0 `` wind '' yields for the computed stars ( @xmath43 , @xmath9 ) with initial mass @xmath43 and metallicity @xmath9 . these yields , noted @xmath44 , are equal to    @xmath45 @xmath46 dt,\\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 is the total lifetime of the star ( @xmath43 , @xmath9 ) , @xmath48 its mass loss rate at age @xmath49 , @xmath50 its @xmath0 surface mass fraction at age @xmath49 , and @xmath51 its initial @xmath0 mass fraction , assumed to relate to @xmath52 by @xmath53 .",
    "these yields may be negative in case most of the ejected material has been depleted in fluorine .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates that the highest yields are obtained for stars with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . at lower metallicities ,",
    "the winds are indeed weaker , and thus uncover the he - burning core only for the most massive stars and when the @xmath56f has already been burnt . on the other hand , at higher metallicities and for @xmath57 ,",
    "the h - burning core mass decreases so rapidly during the main sequence as a consequence of very strong stellar winds that the he - burning core becomes too small for being uncovered by the stellar winds .",
    "the above discussion shows that the most important physical ingredient influencing the wr @xmath0 yields is the metallicity - dependent mass loss rates , quantities like convective core masses being less crucial in this respect . as a numerical example",
    ", the value for @xmath58 rises from about 18 in the 60 m@xmath4 low mass loss rate model of meynet & arnould ( 1993a ) to about 95 in the same model star computed in this paper with an increased @xmath8 value .",
    "this high sensitivity to @xmath8 might cast doubts on the reliability of the predicted @xmath0 yields .",
    "in fact , some confidence in the results presented in this paper may be gained by noting that our present choice of the mass loss rates allows to account for the variation with metallicity of the number ratio of wr to o - type stars in regions of constant star formation rate ( maeder & meynet 1994 ) .",
    "in order to evaluate the level of @xmath0 contamination by the winds of wr stars on a galactic scale , we use the @xmath59 yields [ eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] in a very simple model of galactic chemical evolution making use of the closed box and instantaneous recycling approximations .",
    "we also suppose that only wr stars are able to affect the galactic @xmath0 budget through their winds , all other possible production or destruction sites being neglected .    in such conditions ,",
    "the @xmath0 mass fraction @xmath60 in the galactic gas at time @xmath49 is equal to ( e.g. tinsley 1980 ) @xmath61,\\eqno ( 2)\\ ] ] where * @xmath62 * is the mass fraction of the gas in the galaxy at time @xmath49 , and @xmath63 is a representative time - independent approximation of the net yield of a stellar generation defined by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the `` returned fraction '' , @xmath66 and @xmath67 the lowest and highest mass of the stars going through the wr phase , and @xmath68 the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "it has to be noted that eq .",
    "( 2 ) would break down if the true time- ( or @xmath9-)dependent @xmath69 yields were used instead of @xmath63 . in order to evaluate the latter quantity",
    ", we notice that @xmath70 values of about @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are obtained for @xmath42 , 0.02 and 0.04 if use is made of the @xmath59 values reported in sect .  3 and of the ( properly normalized ) imf derived by kroupa et al .",
    "( 1993 ) . on such grounds",
    ", we just adopt the rough estimate @xmath74 .    if this approximation is used in conjunction with the value @xmath75 considered to characterize the solar neighbourhood at the time of the solar system formation 4.5 billion years ago ( see prantzos & aubert 1995 , and references therein ) , eq .",
    "( 2 ) leads to @xmath76 in the local @xmath54 interstellar medium ( to be compared with the solar system abundance of 4  10@xmath77 ) .",
    "thus , our simple estimate predicts that _ wr stars might account for most of the solar system _ @xmath0 _ content_. even larger @xmath0 quantities would be predicted with the use of the @xmath20 rate of koehler & obrien ( 1989 ) ! after having faced for long the problem of the underproduction of @xmath0 , the theory of nucleosynthesis might now live with the danger of its predicted overabundance .",
    "if this is confirmed by further studies , constraints will obviously have to be put on one model or another .",
    "any @xmath0 present at high redshifts has to have been synthesized in massive stars only",
    ". timmes et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have argued further that its detection at redshifts @xmath7 would in fact be a signature of the @xmath78-process in massive star explosions .",
    "the possibility of @xmath0 production by non - exploding wr stars might in fact weaken this statement , and blur the picture substantially .",
    "of course , one has to acknowledge that the contribution from wr stars at high redshifts may be reduced as a direct result of the lower metallicities that appear to characterize such regions . according to observations of damped lyman @xmath29 systems ( pettini et al .",
    "1997 ) , the metallicity at redshifts between 1.5 and 2 indeed lies around @xmath79 .",
    "such a reduced metallicity lowers the wr @xmath0 yields for two reasons .",
    "first , the number of wr stars predicted by non - rotating single star models is considerably reduced as a result of lower mass losses ( maeder & meynet 1994 ) .",
    "second , the abundances of the cno seeds that are needed for the secondary wr @xmath0 production are reduced as well .",
    "even so , it would certainly be premature at this point to completely forget about the role of wr stars in a possible enrichment of high-@xmath80 material with @xmath0 , and to relate it strictly with the @xmath78-process.this is even more true as the predictions reported in this paper are based on single , non - rotating stellar models only .",
    "how binarity and/or rotation would change these results remains to be checked . at present , the published rotating evolutionary models leading to wr stars ( fliegner & langer 1994 , meynet 1998 , 1999 ) make no predictions concerning the synthesis of fluorine .",
    "however they show that rotation favours an early entrance into the wr phase for a given mass , and decreases the minimum initial mass for a star to go through a wr phase at a given metallicity .",
    "moreover , the mixing induced by rotation opens up new nucleosynthetic channels ( see heger 1998 ) whose importance for the scenario of fluorine production presented in this paper remains to be quantitatively assessed . finally , let us note that the effects of rotation might be more important at low @xmath9 if , as suggested by maeder et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the average rotation is faster at low metallicities . in such conditions , and in absence of quantitative calculations , one has to remain alert to the possibility of a significant contamination of low metallicity high redshift regions by the @xmath0-loaded wind of wr stars .",
    "clearly , observations of @xmath0 at high redshift , if possible at all , would be decisive in order to answer the question of the very production mechanism of this element",
    ". an important distinguishing feature would be the primary nature of the observed @xmath0 , as predicted by the @xmath78-process , or its secondary behaviour , as expected from the thermonuclear model discussed in this paper .",
    "detailed stellar model predictions made in the framework of a very rough model for the chemical evolution of the solar neighbourhood leads to the conclusion that non - exploding non - rotating single wr stars alone could account for the solar @xmath0 content .",
    "this conclusion remains to be ascertained by the adoption of a more realistic galactic evolution model .",
    "still , it appears likely that the considered wr stars might be significant , and even possibly dominant , galactic @xmath0 contributors . in addition",
    ", they might well be responsible for a @xmath0 enrichment , if any , of high - redshift ( @xmath7 ) low - metallicity regions ( @xmath81 0.1 @xmath11 ) .",
    "further predictions are eagerly awaited for rotating , as well as binary , wr stars .",
    "finally , let us stress that the most direct test of the present model would be the measurement of the abundance of fluorine in the wind of wc stars .",
    "it remains to be seen if such observations are really feasible ."
