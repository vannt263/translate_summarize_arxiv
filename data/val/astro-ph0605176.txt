    "the detached m dwarf eclipsing binary tres - her0 - 07621 was published recently as an addition to the few such binary systems previously known @xcite ( see references within , c05 henceforth ) .",
    "this object is interesting because m dwarfs are abundant in our galaxy , and yet are poorly understood .",
    "the binary nature allows us to determine accurate stellar radii and masses .",
    "previously we obtained precise mass estimates of both components of tres - her0 - 07621 ( hobby - eberly telescope , mcdonald observatory ) .",
    "however , due to the 11/pixel resolution of the ccd detectors , our photometric time series is contaminated by a nearby non - variable star , thus providing limitations on the photometric accuracy and precision .",
    "we present some new photometric results based on recently observed non - contaminated time series .",
    "we obtained observations with the _ iac80 _ and _ tcs _ at the observatorio del teide , tenerife and with _ not _ at the observatorio roque de los muchachos , la palma .",
    "the data were reduced using standard reduction procedures and we performed aperture photometry to obtain the time series .",
    "we observed a total of 10 light curves in various filters at 6 different minimum epochs .",
    "we tested to make sure that there were no phase shifts of minimum with filter ( we also found no depth dependance ) .",
    "each of these light curves were fit to a binary system model to obtain the eclipse minima . to obtain a more accurate photometric period , we used the first observed eclipse by stare ( 2003 ) and the quoted hjd from c05 , along with the new minima .",
    "we fit a straight line to the hjd of observed minimum times as a function of elapsed orbital cycle .",
    "the slope of this line gave a period of 1.120804 ( @xmath0 0.000012 ) .",
    "table 1 shows the new eclipse minima for both primary and secondary eclipses .",

    "we have provided new minima times and a refined photometric period for the eclipsing binary system tres - her0 - 07621 .",

    "we hope that this system will contribute to learning more about low mass stars , there is a lack of such systems observed and so any new ones are not only of benefit but necessary in order to advance in this area of stellar physics .",
