    "it is well - known that a string compactified on a @xmath5-torus , @xmath6 possess @xmath7 @xmath8-duality symmetry , exchanging winding and center - of - mass momentum modes .",
    "actually the @xmath9 duality rotation transforms not only these zero - modes but also string oscillator modes among themselves .",
    "in particular , the duality rotation acts non - trivially on the massless states of the graviton , kalb - ramond field and dilaton as well as ramond - ramond @xmath10-forms . to put the @xmath8-duality symmetry manifest in low - energy effective field theory of these massless states , a novel approach called the double field theory ( dft ) was developed @xcite .    in dft ,",
    "the dimensions of spacetime are doubled and all massless fields are covariantly extended over the doubled spacetime . yet , the extension should maintain the same degrees of freedom .",
    "this requirement puts a consistency condition that the extended fields need to be covariantly constrained .",
    "this so - called strong constraint puts actual physical excitations to depend only on half of the doubled spacetime coordinates .",
    "this constraint renders the structure of doubled spacetime quite different from that of the conventional spacetime . as such",
    ", the geometry of the doubled spacetime  both local and global aspects  was not fully understood to date .",
    "in addition to the global @xmath9 duality symmetry , the dft is also invariant under local gauge transformations , which is the generalization of the @xmath5-dimensional coordinate transformations or diffeomorphisms and the gauge transformations of kalb - ramond @xmath11-field .",
    "this combined gauge transformation is called the generalized coordinate transformation @xcite .",
    "better understanding of properties of this generalized coordinate transformation is an important step toward deeper understanding of geometric aspects of dft . under infinitesimal transformations ,",
    "the properties are well understood ; the generalized coordinate transformations are generated by the generalized lie derivatives .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate finite version of the generalized coordinate transformations of doubled spacetime , viz .",
    "the finite gauge transformations of dft .",
    "aspects of the finite generalized coordinate transformations were studied previously .",
    "after the original work by hohm and zwiebach @xcite , finite generalized coordinate transformations in the doubled spacetime and global aspects of the doubled spacetime were examined from various perspectives @xcite .",
    "the finite transformation law is specified by a transformation matrix acting on a ( generalized ) tensor field . in the original approach of hohm and zwiebach ,",
    "the transformation matrix is manifestly @xmath9 covariant and has a simple form , yet left several outstanding issues unanswered .",
    "an issue raised by papadopoulos @xcite is that imposing a patching condition with the transformation matrix puts the three - form field strength @xmath0 of kalb - ramond two - form potential an exact form . as such , in backgrounds with non - trivial @xmath0-flux , it is not possible to patch the doubled spacetime with their transformation matrix .",
    "another issue is that their transformation matrix does not satisfy the composition law in the usual manner @xcite . in order to address these issues further , a completely different approach , which uses the untwisted form of vector fields ,",
    "was proposed by hull @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the transformation matrix was expressed in terms of both a coordinate transformation in a @xmath5-dimensional null subspace @xmath12 inside the doubled spacetime and a gauge parameter , @xmath13 , associated with a finite transformation of kalb - ramond potential @xmath14 .",
    "if we regard the transformation matrix as a transition function between tensor fields in different patches , it should satisfy the cocycle condition on a triple overlap of patches ( which is necessary for the composition law to be satisfied ) .",
    "it was found ( see section 6.5 of @xcite ) that the transformation matrix indeed satisfies the cocycle condition of composition laws , thus ameliorating the issue raised by papadopoulos .    in this paper , we propose a new , physically intuitive approach to finite transformations in dft , which is manifestly free from the above two issues regarding the finite generalized coordinate transformations . our proposal is similar in spirit but different in core physics details to hull @xcite , and also has the desirable feature that allows straightforward extension to efts . in hull s",
    "approach , finite gauge parameter @xmath13 was taken of its own , not associated with any geometric quantities in the doubled spacetime , such as a variation in the dual coordinates . in our approach , we take a different approach and relate the finite gauge parameter @xmath13 to the variation of an antisymmetric two - form @xmath15 ( not to be confused with kalb - ramond two - form potential @xmath14 ) which is a ` geometric ' quantity inherent to the embedding of null subspace @xmath12 inside the doubled spacetime . facilitated by such geometric structures , we show that our proposed approach to finite generalized coordinate transformation achieves the following features :    * the composition laws , necessary for putting generalized diffeomorphisms to the same category as finite - dimensional lie groups or of conventional coordinate transformations in general relativity , * restriction - free patching condition , necessary for describing non - trivial @xmath0 flux background and for formulating immune from the papadopoulos problem @xcite .",
    "an added feature of our approach is that it is straightforwardly generalizable to exceptional spacetimes .",
    "the m - theory is considered to be a nonperturbative unification of all string theories .",
    "the m - theory compactified on a torus @xmath16 is then known to possess a larger duality group , the @xmath17-duality group @xcite .",
    "manifestly @xmath17-duality covariant formulations of the compactified m - theory have been investigated in various works @xcite .",
    "in particular , a new approach , called the exceptional field theory ( eft ) , was developed recently @xcite .",
    "while finite transformations in dft have been studied rather extensively , due to the technical complications in eft , no concrete proposition has been made for finite gauge transformations in eft ( see , however , @xcite for previous discussions related to the finite transformations in eft ) . in this paper , we extend our approach to the finite transformation in dft to the sl(5 ) eft and obtain rules for the finite gauge transformations , which also manifestly satisfy the composition laws .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : finite - transform ] , we recall the finite transformations in infinite - dimensional lie groups and in general relativity . in section [ sec : finite - dft ] , using the untwisted form of vector fields , we construct finite generalized coordinate transformations in dft . for comparison , we first review previous approaches .",
    "we then explain our approach and construct finite transformations in geometric backgrounds .",
    "we explicitly check that this finite transformations obey the composition laws .",

    "their preprint , @xcite , which appeared on the arxiv almost two months after our preprint was posted , significantly overlaps with our results and also significantly misinterprets ours .",
    "before considering finite generalized coordinate transformations , we first review finite transformations in infinite - dimensional lie groups and in general relativity , both formulated as differential geometry of metric manifold .",
    "we first recall the relation between a lie algebra @xmath19 and its lie group @xmath20 @xcite with particular attention to infinite - dimensional situation .",
    "if @xmath20 is finite - dimensional , it is well - known that , at least locally around an identity element , the lie group @xmath20 is completely described by its lie algebra @xmath19 .",
    "this correspondence is given by the exponential map , @xmath21 in fact , for every @xmath22 , there always exists a unique analytic homomorphism @xmath23 of @xmath24 into @xmath20 with @xmath25 .",
    "so , the exponential map is a ` local diffeomorphism ' from the lie algebra @xmath19 to the lie group @xmath20 .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath22 and let @xmath26 the corresponding left - invariant vector field .",
    "the flow of the field @xmath26 is a map @xmath27 such that @xmath28 the flow @xmath29 is the solution of this first - order , nonlinear ordinary differential equation . for finite - dimensional",
    "lie algebra , the solution always exists and is unique . in the case the flow subgroup @xmath30 exists for all @xmath22 , the exponential map is defined by the unit - time map @xmath31 .",
    "note that the analytic homomorphism of @xmath24 into @xmath20 used for the exponential map defines a one - parameter subgroup of the lie group @xmath20 : @xmath32 it has the properties that @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35    if @xmath20 is infinite - dimensional , this correspondence is no longer straightforward",
    ". there could exist lie groups that do not admit an exponential map .",
    "moreover , even if the exponential map exists , it may not be a local diffeomorphism .",
    "furthermore , there could exist infinite - dimensional lie algebras that do not correspond to any lie group .",
    "this is in failure of lie s third theorem , which states that every finite - dimensional lie algebra is the lie algebra attached to some finite - dimensional lie group .",
    "one may avoid such pathologies by restricting @xmath20 to the class of banach lie groups , viz .",
    "the lie groups that are locally defined on banach spaces and behave like finite - dimensional lie groups . in this case",
    ", the exponential map always exists and is a local diffeomorphism .",
    "such restrictions would already exclude the important case of diffeomorphism groups . this explains why infinite - dimensional differential geometry and infinite - dimensional lie groups are still under active development .",
    "we next recall some elements of semi - riemannian geometry ( see @xcite for concise exposition ) .",
    "we consider a differentiable lorentzian manifold @xmath36 with local coordinates @xmath37 . for a given vector field @xmath38",
    ", we can obtain integral curves or one - parameter families of diffeomorphism , @xmath39 with @xmath40 , that has the properties @xmath41 for all @xmath42 and for all @xmath43 .",
    "an integral curve @xmath44 through a point @xmath45 , of coordinates @xmath46 , is a solution of the differential equation : @xmath47 given the diffeomorphism @xmath48 and a function @xmath49 , we can define the pullback of @xmath49 onto the integral curve by @xmath50 using this , we can define the pushforward , @xmath51 of a vector field @xmath52 , by @xmath53 where the dot denotes the directional derivative , @xmath54 .",
    "we can then define the pullback @xmath55 of a one - form field @xmath56 by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the conventional canonical pairing of a one - form field and a vector field . since @xmath48 is a diffeomorphism , it has the inverse map @xmath59 .",
    "so , we can define the pullback of a vector field or the pushforward of a one - form field by @xmath60 from these , the pushforward ( or also the pullback , @xmath61 ) of an arbitrary @xmath62-tensor field , @xmath63 , is straightforwardly given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 are arbitrary one - form fields and @xmath66 are arbitrary vector fields .",
    "the lie derivative @xmath67 acting on the @xmath62-tensor field is then defined by @xmath68    up to this point , all definitions and properties are general and valid for arbitrary spacetime manifold . in particular , they should be applicable to doubled or exceptional spacetimes ( though the definitions might be not sufficient ) , else it would be difficult to endow a geometric interpretation for such spacetimes .",
    "moreover , if there is no constraint on the coordinate dependence of dynamical fields or gauge parameters , taking @xmath69 in , we can completely determine the finite transformation law acting on a vector field @xmath52 , @xmath70 and extend it to arbitrary tensor fields . from",
    ", we easily obtain the conventional lie derivative : @xmath71    for diffeomorphisms of steady flow type , the vector field @xmath38 is independent of the parameter @xmath72 . in this case , the integral curve , @xmath73 , and the pullback of a @xmath62-tensor field can formally be expressed as @xmath74 for diffeomorphisms of non - steady flow type , the vector field @xmath38 depends on the parameter @xmath72 .",
    "if so , the integral curves of @xmath38 at a fixed @xmath72 ( i.e.  streamlines ) do not coincide with the pathlines , @xmath73 , which are defined through with the @xmath72-dependent @xmath38 . in this case",
    ", expressions like do not hold . in dft , we sometimes consider this kind of @xmath72-dependent @xmath38 .",
    "to be self - contained , we also recall the active and passive interpretations of the finite transformation law . in the above discussion",
    ", we adopted the active point of view , but we can also interpret or @xmath75 as caused by a passive coordinate transformation . in the active point of view , @xmath76 were the coordinate values after the active diffeomorphism , @xmath77 . on the other hand , in the passive interpretation , @xmath78 are interpreted as the new local coordinates while the physical point , @xmath45 , is not changed under the transformation . in other words , defining the new coordinates @xmath79 and the transformed components @xmath80 , the formula @xmath81 is interpreted as induced by the coordinate transformation , @xmath82 .",
    "this is simply a change in the interpretation .",
    "formally , if one compares this with the pullback in the active point of view , one just changes in the sign in the transformed coordinates , @xmath83 .",
    "we now generalize the above considerations to the situation that the manifold @xmath36 is doubled or exceptional spacetime . when we defined dft or eft , the key difference from the general relativity is the presence of strong constraint .",
    "the constraint imposes that , if we introduce a suitable local coordinates , @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , , while exceptional spacetime corresponds to @xmath86 . ] all tensor fields and gauge parameters must be independent of the dual coordinates , @xmath87 ( i.e.  @xmath88 ) .",
    "then , the function @xmath49 in the left - hand side of can not depend on the dual coordinates , @xmath87 either . in the following ,",
    "we denote a finitely transformed generalized vector , with a gauge parameter @xmath89 and a parameter @xmath72 , by @xmath90 .",
    "as the finite gauge transformation can be identified with the pullback under a finite diffeomorphism , @xmath91 , it should satisfy @xmath92 here , we used the section constraint @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the second equality . as the first equality in is the defining equation for @xmath90 ,",
    "the disappearance of the dual components @xmath95 in the rightmost side means that we can not determine @xmath95 only from geometric considerations .",
    "put differently , in dft and eft , there is a room for a modification of the dual components @xmath95 from the conventional transformation law .    in dft ,",
    "where @xmath96 are doubled coordinates and @xmath97 , @xmath98 are doubled vector fields , the gauge symmetries are generated by the generalized lie derivative @xcite : @xmath99 this can be identified with an infinitesimal diffeomorphism in the doubled spacetime @xmath36 . with the section constraint , @xmath100 imposed , the generalized lie derivative of dft becomes , following @xcite , although @xmath101 is more commonly used in the literature . ]",
    "@xmath102 where @xmath67 is the conventional lie derivative along the vector field @xmath103 . as is clear from , the dual components ( the lower - half components ) of @xmath104 are indeed modified from the conventional lie derivative in the doubled spacetime .",
    "extension to eft is straightforward .",
    "once the generalized lie derivative , @xmath105 , is prescribed , we first solve the first - order ordinary differential equation @xmath106 and obtain the finitely transformed generalized vector @xmath90 for an arbitrary finite parameter @xmath72 .",
    "we then rewrite the vector @xmath90 in terms of the transformed coordinates , @xmath107 .",
    "it then becomes clear that the transformed coordinates @xmath73 should be given by @xmath108 in order to satisfy , while , since all fields are independent of the dual coordinates , the transformed dual coordinates @xmath109 are arbitrary .",
    "our key idea is to exploit the fact that the transformed dual coordinates @xmath110 are arbitrary , equivalently , there is no canonical definition of them .",
    "indeed , in dft , as we shall recall in section [ sec : review - dft ] , several alternative definitions @xmath111 or @xmath112 were already considered .-",
    "field gauge transformation as a diffeomorphism in the dual coordinates ( as in hohm and zwiebach s approach @xcite ) , the three - form field strength , @xmath113 , becomes globally an exact form due to the papadopoulos problem @xcite ( we would like to thank c.  hull for conversation on this point ) .",
    "we comment on this issue in detail in section [ sec : dual - direction ] . ] in section [ sec : dual - direction ] , we put forward a new definition of @xmath110 with which we can show that firstly the papadopoulos problem does not arise and secondly the composition law is satisfied ( see section [ sec : composition ] ) .",
    "our goal is to obtain the pullback @xmath90 and express it in terms of the transformed coordinates @xmath73 and a geometric quantity @xmath15 to be defined later .",
    "in this section , we present details of our proposed definition of finite transformations in dft . in section [ sec : review - dft ] , we begin by reviewing previous approaches for finite transformations in dft . since the doubled spacetime has an invariant tensor @xmath114 , called the @xmath9 metric , that is used to raise or lower the indices , once the finite transformation law for a generalized vector @xmath115 ( or instead @xmath116 ) is obtained , the transformation law for arbitrary tensors can be readily obtained .",
    "the main task of this section is thus to obtain @xmath90 by solving the differential equation .",
    "our proposal for the finite transformation is defined in [ sec : finite - geom ] , which is physically intuitive in terms of the geometry of null subspaces .",
    "our definition of the transformed dual coordinates and a discussion about the papadopoulos problem is given in section [ sec : dual - direction ] .",
    "the composition law of our finite transformations is shown in section [ sec : composition ] . in section [ sec : non - geom ] , we construct finite transformations in non - geometric backgrounds .        in the original approach by hohm and zwiebach @xcite , the finite transformation law ( or pushforward ) of a generalized vector field @xmath117 under a ( passive ) finite coordinate transformation , @xmath118 ,",
    "was proposed as @xmath119 imposing the strong constraint , they found that the transformation matrix @xmath120 obeys @xmath121 they then showed that the transformed generalized vector @xmath122 can be expressed as the exponentiation of the generalized lie derivative with a gauge parameter @xmath89 , @xmath123 here , the gauge parameter , @xmath89 , is assumed to be related to the original parameter , @xmath124 ( introduced for the coordinate change ) , via @xmath125 with certain functions @xmath126 and @xmath127 satisfying the strong constraint ( which gives @xmath128 ) . for arbitrary field @xmath129 , so from , we have @xmath130 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath131 and it shows the second equality in . ]    in the coordinates with @xmath132 , this relation has the form , @xmath133 so the difference between @xmath89 and @xmath124 is only in the dual components .",
    "thus , the standard components of the transformed coordinates is simply @xmath134 , as it should be . in @xcite , the explicit form of @xmath135 satisfying the relation",
    "was found up to the quartic order in @xmath89 ; @xmath136 they also discussed in detail subtleties of their approach in the composition of finite transformations ( see also @xcite for further discussion ) .",
    "the higher order corrections for @xmath135 within this approach was further studied in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , park obtained a result similar to hohm and zwiebach from an active diffeomorphism point of view .",
    "as in the latter approach , the transformation matrix for a generalized vector field under a finite ( active ) diffeomorphism , @xmath137 , was identified with the matrix @xmath120 : @xmath138 he showed that @xmath139 satisfies @xmath140 where @xmath141 it follows that @xmath142 for an arbitrary @xmath72 .",
    "note that , since @xmath143 explicitly depends on the parameter @xmath72 , @xmath144 can not be written as an exponential form @xmath145 .",
    "as such , it is not easy to compare the result with .    in @xcite , coordinate transformations generated by generalized vectors of the form , @xmath146 , were called the coordinate gauge symmetry . as shown there , imposing the condition , @xmath132 , this symmetry turns out equivalent to the gauge symmetry for the kalb - ramond two - form potential @xmath11 . as the difference between the gauge parameter , @xmath143 , and the diffeomorphism parameter , @xmath89 , in is just given by a coordinate gauge symmetry , it was claimed that the exponentiation of the generalized lie derivative @xmath147 matches with up to the coordinate gauge symmetry . in @xcite , it was further shown that if all points related by the coordinate gauge symmetry are identified as a single physical point , the strong constraint can be automatically derived .",
    "there also , a string worldsheet action which is invariant under the coordinate gauge symmetry was developed .      in this approach @xcite , the finite transformation law under a passive transformation @xmath148",
    "was given by @xmath149 they then showed that the transformation matrix , @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ) , is related to @xmath120 via @xmath152 with @xmath153 under the constraint , @xmath132 , the matrix @xmath154 has the only non - vanishing components , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 corresponds to a @xmath11-field transformation .",
    "they referred this @xmath11-field transformations as non - translating transformations , and claimed that the exponentiation of the generalized lie derivative , @xmath157 , matches with @xmath120 up to a non - translating transformation .",
    "they also confirmed consistency with hohm and zwiebach s result up to the cubic order in @xmath158 .",
    "moreover , they stressed that , if the matrix @xmath120 is regarded as a map , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , it is not a group homomorphism ; @xmath161 this implies the composition law is not satisfied .",
    "they further discussed the relation between the failure of the composition law and the gerbe structure associated with the @xmath11-field transformations .",
    "a different approach , using an untwisted vector , was developed in @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the strong constraint @xmath132 is solved at the outset , and all fields depend only on the coordinates @xmath37 of a @xmath5-dimensional null subspace @xmath12 .",
    "further , one considers the coordinate change only on the null plane @xmath12 ( which is one leaf of a constant-@xmath162 foliation ) , while the dual coordinates are always kept invariant , @xmath163 .",
    "now , for a given generalized vector @xmath164 , one associates the untwisted vector , @xmath165 , by @xmath166 here , @xmath167 , called a gerbe connection , is an anti - symmetric two - form which transforms as @xmath168 under the gauge transformation . in @xcite , it was chosen to be the kalb - ramond @xmath11-field .",
    "an important property of the untwisted vector @xmath169 is that the transformation under the gauge symmetry is simply given by the conventional lie derivative : @xmath170 as such , the untwisted vector @xmath165 is independent of transformations generated by @xmath171 . therefore , the transformation law under a finite ( passive ) coordinate transformation , @xmath82 , is given by @xmath172 under the constraint @xmath132 , the gauge symmetry of dft is a semi - direct product of diffeomorphisms and @xmath11-field transformations , so a finite transformation law for the @xmath11-field should be expressible as @xmath173 where @xmath13 is a certain gauge parameter associated with the finite @xmath11-field gauge transformation . by combining and ,",

    "if one instead use hohm and zwiebach s @xmath188 as the transition function , one obtains @xmath189 and finds a gerbe - like structure @xcite , implying violation of the composition law .",
    "thus , there is no reason to consider the matrix @xmath120 as an exact expression for the finite transformation matrix ; @xmath120 is equal to the exponential of the generalized lie derivative ( or @xmath190 in ) only up to a @xmath11-field gauge transformation and also does not satisfy the composition law .",
    "it is worth to note that if we identify all spacetime points related by the coordinate gauge symmetry as in @xcite , the transformation matrices @xmath120 and @xmath157 are equivalent each other . in this case",
    ", one can show that both of them satisfies the composition law since all @xmath11-field gauge transformations can be canceled by using the coordinate gauge symmetry . because of this , one might consider the approach of @xcite is consistent .",
    "however , assumption of the coordinate gauge symmetry is restrictive since , after modding out the @xmath11-field transformations , the remaining gauge symmetry is only the @xmath5-dimensional diffeomorphisms and we can not consider a non - trivial patching of doubled spacetime @xcite . in this sense , the approach of @xcite is more satisfactory , as the finite transformations obey the composition law without modding out @xmath11-field transformations .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that , under the condition @xmath132 , the finite transformation matrix can always be expressed in the form . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also the case that finite transformation can be expressed as the exponential of generalized lie derivative , @xmath191 , which was the original problem posed in @xcite . in the decomposition of the gauge parameter as @xmath192 , the parameter @xmath193 would be related to @xmath79 in by @xmath177 . on the other hand ,",
    "the relation between @xmath13 , that was introduced in , and @xmath89 was not identified in @xcite . since a finite transformation of the @xmath11-field",

    "however , in the absence of the explicit form of @xmath199 , we can only claim the following trivial statement : a composition of two finite diffeomorphisms and @xmath11-field gauge transformations can be expressed again as a single finite diffeomorphisms and a @xmath11-field gauge transformation . ]",
    "we now construct a new finite transformation law , in geometric backgrounds in this subsection and in non - geometric backgrounds in subsection 3.4 .",
    "we use the untwisted vector as in the approach of @xcite . however , the key difference of our approach is that we express the finite transformation for the @xmath11-field in terms of the transformed coordinates , @xmath108 , and a ` geometric ' quantity , @xmath15 , instead of the gauge parameter , @xmath13 .",
