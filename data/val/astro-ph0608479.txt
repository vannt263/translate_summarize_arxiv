    "recent x - ray spectral studies using xmm-_newton _  and _ chandra_@xcite have begun to unravel the nature of the faint x - ray sources that make up the bulk of the extragalactic x - ray background ( xrb ) below 10  kev .",
    "most of these sources are accretion powered agn @xcite .",
    "however , the population is far from homogeneous ; the agn exhibit a range of spectral properties , both in x - rays , and at other wavelengths . unified models of agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have been reasonably successful in explaining the observational differences between the various classes of agn / seyfert galaxies .",
    "the x - ray spectra of the agn can , in the majority of cases , be adequately described by a power - law model , in many cases with some degree of absorption .",
    "the agn with significant x - ray absorption are predominantly identified with narrow emission line galaxies , and are seen as higher redshift , higher luminosity analogues of nearby seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "population synthesis models such as those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite use a superposition of faint agn to reproduce the observed xrb .",
    "these models incorporate a large fraction of absorbed agn in order to reproduce the hard spectrum of the xrb .",
    "@xcite found that the xrb could be reproduced using a model in which the absorbed and unabsorbed agn shared a common intrinsic x - ray luminosity function .",
    "a similar agn population model was found to represent adequately the multi - wavelength properties of agn in the goods dataset @xcite . in our previous work @xcite , we compared the x - ray colour distribution of sources detected in the @xmath4  xmm-_newton _  deep field with the x - ray colour distributions predicted by a number of model @xmath5 distributions .",
    "we found that the best match to the data was made by a @xmath5 distribution model in which absorbed and unabsorbed agn share the same intrinsic luminosity function , and where the number of agn per unit @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "however , the results from other studies based upon deep x - ray surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) , appear to contradict some of the foundations of these simple synthesis models .",
    "these studies all found that on average , the absorbed agn which are optically identified lie at lower redshifts , and have lower intrinsic luminosities , than their unabsorbed counterparts .",
    "clearly the relationship between absorption and luminosity in the agn population requires further examination .",
    "therefore , in order to constrain the relationship between agn luminosity , redshift and absorption we have undertaken a study of the x - ray properties of agn in the _ chandra _  deep field - south ( cdfs ) . in this study",
    "we examine the 500  ks xmm-_newton _  european photon imaging camera ( epic ) observations of the cdfs  ( hereafter xmm - cdfs ) which provide a superb dataset for measuring the spectral properties of faint x - ray sources",
    ". the epic imaging reaches to fluxes well below the break in the 25  kev source counts , covers around 0.19  deg@xmath8 and contains enough photons to permit broad band x - ray spectral analysis for even the faintest sources .",
    "the studies of @xcite and @xcite have also used the xmm - cdfs  dataset to investigate the x - ray spectra of a number of the brighter agn in the field . however , until this work , there has been no investigation of the x - ray properties of the entire source population detected in the xmm-_newton _  imaging .",
    "the epic data are complimented by _",
    "chandra _",
    "observations @xcite , which provide sub - arcsecond positions for the majority of the epic sources , allowing us to identify uniquely the x - ray sources with optical counterparts .",
    "what is more , the entire epic field of view is covered by the combo-17  survey @xcite , providing photometric redshift estimates for nearly all @xmath9 optical counterparts .",
    "we use an extensive monte carlo simulation process to recover the @xmath5 and intrinsic luminosity of the agn detected in our sample .",
    "we also use the simulations to compare directly the distribution of sources with the predictions of a number of agn population models .",
    "this paper is laid out as follows . in section [ sec : xmm_data ]",
    "we describe the reduction of the xmm-_newton _  data , and the source detection process . in section [ sec : other_data ] we detail how we have correlated this with the other datasets available in the cdfs . in section",
    "[ sec : nh_method ] we introduce our monte carlo method for calculating the absorption and luminosity of the sample , and we demonstrate its fidelity . in section [ sec : results ] we present the distribution of absorption , luminosity and redshift in the xmm - cdfs  sample and compare it to the predictions of a number of agn population models .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : discussion ] we compare our results to those found by other studies and discuss the implications for agn population models .    throughout the paper",
    "we use a lambda - dominated flat cosmology with @xmath10  km  s@xmath2mpc@xmath2 , @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the flux of a source in the observed @xmath13@xmath14  kev band , corrected for galactic absorption .",
    "@xmath15 refers to an object s _ intrinsic _ x - ray luminosity ( that is , before absorption ) , in the rest - frame 210  kev energy band .",
    "@xmath5 is the equivalent hydrogen column density in units of @xmath16 .",
    "the xmm-_newton _  data consist of two observations carried out in july 2001 , and six in january 2002 .",
    "the observations all have similar pointing centres ( approximately @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) , but the jan 2002 observations have position angle rotated @xmath19 with respect to the july 2001 observations .",
    "the xmm-_newton_data cover @xmath20  deg@xmath8 ( nearly twice the sky area of the 1ms _ chandra _  observations ) , and total around 500  ks .",
    "all three epic detectors ( mos1 , mos2 and pn ) were operated with the ` thin1 ' filters and were in full frame mode .",
    "the xmm-_newton _  data were reduced using standard science analysis software ( sas , version 6.0 ) tasks , following the method described by @xcite .",
    "after temporally filtering periods of enhanced particle background from the event lists , we are left with approximately 340  ks of pn , and 395  ks of mos exposure time .",
    "we notice an enhancement of the 0.20.5  kev background level for ccd  # 5 of mos1 , therefore we have discarded all the data from this chip in this energy range .",
    "we note that this effect has been reported recently by @xcite .",
    "we make an image , and an exposure map for each of the epic cameras , in each of the 0.20.5 , 0.52 , 25 and 510  kev energy bands , and for each of the eight observations .",
    "we also produce out - of - time event images for the pn camera in each of the four energy bands and for each observation which are used later by the background fitting algorithm .",
    "we have tied our coordinate system to the positions of ( relatively ) bright point - like x - ray sources detected in the 1ms _ chandra _  imaging of the field , taking into account the ( -1.1 , 0.8 ) offset between the _ chandra _  positions and optical counterparts @xcite . a summary of the xmm-_newton",

    "exposure times are given in kiloseconds for the pn and the average of the two mos detectors , and indicate the length of good time remaining after removing periods of high background . [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is important to point out that in our statistical comparison of the models and the xmm - cdfs  sample in section [ sec : absorbed_fraction ] , we first grouped the agn into a number of bins in redshift / luminosity , and then calculated the fraction ( rather than the absolute number ) of agn with significant absorption in each bin . therefore , even if the agn in the cdfs  field _ do _ have a distribution in redshift / luminosity space which is unrepresentative of the universe at large , we still expect our findings about the agn absorption distribution to be valid .",
    "recently , @xcite have published the results of a",
    "_ chandra_x - ray spectral analysis of sources detected in the 1ms _ chandra_imaging of the cdfs .",
    "here we briefly compare the results of the latter study with our own .",
    "after careful correction for selection effects @xcite find no evidence for a correlation between absorption and intrinsic luminosity , in agreement with our findings .",
    "the intrinsic ( that is before selection effects ) @xmath5 distribution derived by @xcite is a log - normal distribution broadly similar ( at least below @xmath21  @xmath16 ) to the _ t04_model .",
    "however , the _ t04",
    "_  model is strongly rejected as a good description of the xmm - cdfs  population ( see table [ tab : stat_test ] ) , primarily because it under - predicts the number of unabsorbed sources in the xmm - cdfs  and predicts too many sources with @xmath22  @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nh_histo ] ) .",
    "we now compare the absorption and luminosity measurements for the sources common to the xmm - cdfs  sample and the @xcite study .",
    "redshifts for some of the @xcite sources are taken from @xcite , several of which we have determined to have incorrect optical counterparts .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of this comparison , we consider only 142 sources out of the 158 sources which appear in both the xmm - cdfs  and the @xcite samples . in the left hand panels of figure [ fig : compare_to_tozzi ]",
    "we compare the @xmath5 measurements of these 142 agn .",
    "it can be seen that there are some differences in the absorbing columns determined by the two studies .",
    "the most marked difference is for xmm - cdfs  sources which we determine to have effectively zero absorption ( @xmath23  @xmath16 ) , but which are found to have a high ( @xmath24  @xmath16 ) absorbing column by @xcite .",
    "this effect is apparent in both the @xmath5 scatter plot and the @xmath5 histogram , with the @xcite study finding @xmath25 times as many sources in the @xmath26  @xmath16 bin .",
    "the @xcite spectral fitting has been carried out over the 0.77  kev acis - i sensitivity range . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the limited soft energy range of the _ chandra _  data sometimes means that unabsorbed sources are spuriously scattered into the high absorption ( @xmath27  @xmath16 ) regime .",
    "this effect could explain the differences between the @xmath5 distributions measured for objects in common to xmm - cdfs  and the @xcite study .",
    "the luminosity measurements agree very well as demonstrated by the right hand panels of figure [ fig : compare_to_tozzi ] .",
    "the exceptions are the few sources for which @xcite have chosen to fit with a pure reflection model . for such objects ,",
    "the luminosities we determine are typically lower than determined by @xcite .",
    "the absorption distribution of agn in the xmm - cdfs  sample is best matched by population models in which obscured agn are @xmath28 times as populous as unobscured agn at all redshifts and luminosities , implying that most ( @xmath3 ) supermassive black hole growth was obscured .",
    "various studies have attempted to reconcile the observed accretion powered luminosity density at high redshifts , with the locally observed relic black hole mass function ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that the agn population model of ( * ? ? ? * xlf and @xmath5 function ) was consistent with the local black hole mass function if the mean accretion efficiency is @xmath29 .",
    "however , as we have shown in this study , the observed numbers of luminous , absorbed agn are substantially higher than the predictions of the _ u03 _  @xmath5 model .",
    "coupled with the @xcite findings , the implication is that the mean accretion efficiency is higher than the @xcite result , or alternatively that the local black hole mass density has been underestimated .",
    "we have analysed the distribution of absorption in a sample of agn detected in the very deep xmm-_newton _  observations of the cdfs .",
    "importantly , spectroscopic or photometric redshift determinations are available for 84% of the x - ray sample .",
    "we determined the absorption and intrinsic luminosity of each agn using a novel method which takes advantage of the high photon throughput and broad bandpass of xmm-_newton_epic .",
    "the agn in the xmm - cdfs  sample were compared to the predictions of a number of model agn populations , using monte carlo simulations which allow for the selection function and particulars of the xmm-_newton_observations .",
    "we find no evidence for a decline in the fraction of agn with significant absorption at high luminosities that has been reported by many authors .",
    "the @xmath5 distribution models which most closely match the pattern of absorption in the xmm - cdfs  sample are independent of redshift and luminosity .",
    "our sample contains at least 23 heavily absorbed agn with qso - like luminosities .",
    "we postulate that nearly half of the objects without redshift determinations are also absorbed qsos ; the reason they are without combo-17  redshift estimates is because they lie in the `` photo - z desert '' ( @xmath30 ) . in order to confirm this hypothesis ,",
    "the redshifts of these optically faint objects must be determined ; photo-@xmath31s incorporating near- and mid - infrared photometry should make this possible .",
