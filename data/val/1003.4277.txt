    "many zero - sum games do not have a solution without allowing for mixed actions .",
    "what is the class of zero - sum games possessing pure saddle points ? some answers to these questions have been given by shapley ( 1964 ) and radzik ( 1991 ) .",
    "for instance , shapley ( 1964 ) showed that a finite two - player zero - sum game has a pure saddle point if every 2x2 submatrix of the game has a pure saddle point .",
    "radzik ( 1991 ) provided conditions using a discrete notion of quasiconcavity / quasiconvexity .",
    "he showed for instance that a two - player zero - sum game whose columns are quasiconcave ( i.e. single - peaked ) and whose rows are quasiconvex has a pure saddle point if and only if every submatrix `` along the diagonal '' has a pure saddle point .",
    "although both shapley s and radzik s results apply to symmetric two - player zero - sum games , none of their results exploits the symmetry property .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in pure saddle points of _ symmetric _ two - player zero - sum games .",

    "a symmetric two - player zero - sum game has a pure saddle point if and only if it is not a generalized rock - paper - scissors game .",
    "moreover , we show that every finite symmetric quasiconcave two - player zero - sum game has a pure saddle point .",
    "we also provide alternative sufficient conditions for existence in terms of increasing and decreasing differences , potentials and additive separability of payoffs .",
    "it turns out that a symmetric two - player zero - sum game has increasing differences if and only if it has decreasing differences .",
    "this implies that the payoff function is a valuation . by topkis ( 1998 )",
    "this is equivalent to additively separable payoffs and by brnzei , mallozzi , and tijs ( 2003 ) it is equivalent to being an exact potential game  la monderer and shapley ( 1996 ) .",
    "we apply our theory to a rich class of examples .",
    "zero - sum games arise naturally when relative payoffs of arbitrary two - player games are considered .",
    "the class of symmetric two - player zero - sum games coincides with the class of relative payoff games associated with symmetric two - player games .",
    "pure saddle point actions of relative payoff games characterize finite population evolutionary stable strategies in the underlying game .",
    "we apply our result to show the existence of finite evolutionary stable strategy in cournot duopoly , bertrand duopoly , public goods games , common pool resource games , minimum effort coordination games , synergistic relationships , arms race , diamond s search , nash demand game , rent seeking etc .",
    "the notion of finite population evolutionary stable strategy ( fess ) has been introduced by schaffer ( 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "he also noted the relationship between pure saddle points in relative payoff games and finite population evolutionary stable strategy of the underlying game .",
    "this relationship between nash equilibrium and fess equilibrium has been analyzed for competitive games by ania ( 2008 ) and for `` weakly competitive '' games by hehenkamp , possajennikov , and guse ( 2010 ) .",
    "versions of fess have been applied to learning and evolution in als - ferrer and ania ( 2005 ) , hehenkamp , leininger , and possajennikov ( 2004 ) , leininger ( 2006 ) , matros , temzilidis , and duffy ( 2009 ) , possajennikov ( 2003 ) , schipper ( 2003 ) , tanaka ( 2000 ) , and vega - redondo ( 1997 ) .",
