    "the tumbling dynamics depends on the nature of the object and on its interaction with the fluid : tumbling may occur only within a restricted range of shear rates , and it can be periodic , chaotic , or random .",
    "axisymmetric solid particles and elastic dumbbells are among the simplest objects that tumble in shear flows . in a viscous simple shear flow of a newtonian fluid , a neutrally buoyant axisymmetric particle spends most of the time aligned with the direction of the flow and periodically reverses its orientation @xcite .",
    "if the axisymmetry of the particle is broken , the tumbling motion may become doubly - periodic or even chaotic @xcite .",
    "an elastic dumbbell , which consists of two beads joined by a spring , also performs an end - over - end tumbling motion in a shear flow @xcite . under the effect of brownian fluctuations ,",
    "the reversals occur at random times and are characterised by a transition from the stretched to the coiled state .",
    "the distribution of the time intervals separating two reversals has an exponential tail with a time scale that decreases as a power - law of the weissenberg number ( the product of the amplitude of the velocity gradient and the relaxation time of the spring ) .    here",
    "we address the question of whether tumbling can also exist in stretching - dominated flows and , if so , what the minimal requirements are for a particle to tumble in such flows and how the resulting tumbling motion compares with the analogous motion in a shear flow .",
    "the orientational dynamics of an axisymmetric particle or of an elastic dumbbell in a purely extensional velocity field is trivial : such objects indeed simply align with the stretching direction . in order to observe tumbling in an extensional flow",
    ", we must consider objects that can bend .",

    ", the trumbbell was originally used to study the low - frequency dynamics of stiff macromolecules analytically ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "we examine this tumbling - through - folding dynamics in terms of the stable configurations of the trumbbell and of the associated basins of attraction .",
    "the properties of the statistics of the tumbling times are explained by using the large deviations theory . in particular , the analysis of the tumbling statistics reveals a fundamental difference between the tumbling motion of a trumbbell in an extensional flow and the tumbling motion of an elastic dumbbell in a simple shear flow . in the former case , indeed , the mean time that separates two reversals grows with the weissenberg number , and the growth is exponential .",

    "the mere consideration of one bending mode indeed yields a random end - over - end tumbling motion with exponentially distributed tumbling times .",
    "while it is well known that several microscopic objects tumble in a shear flow , to the best of our knowledge tumbling had not been observed in an extensional flow before .",

    "this difference is a consequence of the fact that the configurations aligned with the flow are stable in an extensional flow , whereas they are unstable in a shear flow .",
    "we have also shown that , in an extensional flow , a trumbbell reverses its orientation by folding and then extending again in the opposite direction .",
    "this dynamics is reminiscent of the buckling instability of a fiber near to a hyperbolic point @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the tumbling motion described here is triggered by brownian fluctuations that bend the trumbbell , whereas the buckling instability of a fiber results from its internal dynamics and does not necessarily require brownian fluctuations .",
    "the simplicity of the trumbbell model has allowed us to study its tumbling motion in detail and to relate this phenomenon to the properties of the stable configurations of the trumbbell and to the structure of the corresponding basins of attraction . in our study , we have focused on the most elementary version of the trumbbell model . in particular ,",
    "we have disregarded hydrodynamic and excluded volume interactions between the beads .",
