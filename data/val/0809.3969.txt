    "hh  262 is the designation of a group of emitting knots , surrounded by more diffuse emission , located @xmath1 3.5 arcmin to the northeast of the source l1551-irs5 in taurus . the two brightest hh  262 condensations ( named gh9 and gh10 ) were first reported by @xcite and @xcite . in the h@xmath0+[nii ]  and [ sii ]  narrow - band images , hh  262 shows a rather chaotic ,  hour - glass-shaped morphology that is quite different from the collimated structures found in most of the herbig ",
    "haro ( hh ) jets ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "apparently , the morphology of hh  262 seems to trace a wind - blown cavity from an embedded source located close to the gh10 knot .",
    "however , no point source suitable for powering the hh  262 emission has been currently reported at this location . since its discovery , the origin of hh  262 , as well as its relationship with other outflows in the l1551 star - forming region , has been matter of discussion .",
    "@xcite first suggested that the gh9 and gh10 knots were associated with the redshifted lobe of the molecular outflow powered by the source l1551-irs5 .",
    "they proposed that gh9 and gh10 may be the redshifted counterpart of a chain of hh bright knots ( which includes the well - known hh objects 28 and 29 ) extending from l1551-irs5 to the southwest up to @xmath1 5 arcmin , and suggested that all these optical knots traced the walls of a wind cavity evacuated by the co outflow powered by l1551-irs5 .",
    "later on , @xcite obtained a long - slit spectrum across the gh9 and gh10 knots . from the h@xmath0 line , they derived redshifted radial velocities covering a range extending over @xmath1 100  km  s@xmath5and measure peak velocities of + 40  km  s@xmath5   and + 90  km  s@xmath5  and average velocities of + 20  km  s@xmath5and + 45  km  s@xmath5 in the gh9 and gh10 knots , respectively .",
    "these results reinforced the suggestion that gh9 and gh10 were associated with the redshifted lobe of the co outflow powered by l1551-irs5 .",
    "the kinematics of hh  262 , obtained by @xcite from proper motion measurements of the brightest knots , and from radial velocities derived from fabry - perot observations in the [ sii ]  @xmath6 6716   line , is also consistent with the interpretation of the hh  262 origin mentioned before .",
    "however , @xcite were uncertain whether the exciting source of hh  262 is l1551-irs5 or l1551 ne , another younger , embedded proto - binary source located @xmath1 150 arcsec northeast of irs5 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "l1551 ne also drives a molecular co outflow , so that it is likely that the outflows powered by these two sources are interacting .",
    "further observations from @xcite showed evidence of blueshifted molecular gas arising close to l1551 ne that extends to the northeast of the source and encompasses hh  262 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , hh  262 could be related to either the l1551-irs5 or l1551 ne outflows , its rather chaotic morphology originating through the interaction between the molecular outflows powered by these two sources ( see diagram of fig.[diagram1 ] ) .",
    "more recent sub - mm continuum observations at 850 @xmath7 m by @xcite detected emission around hh  262 that were interpreted as produced by warm dust entrained by the molecular outflows .",
    "hh  262 is thus a suitable place to search for optical signatures of the interactions among supersonic outflows .",
    "in addition , because of its morphology , hh  262 is better suited for performing integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) than long - slit observations when the kinematics and physical conditions of the emission need to be analysed .    with the aim of advancing in the study of hh  262",
    ", we included this target within a program of integral field spectroscopy of herbig ",
    "haro objects using the potsdam multi - aperture spectrophotometer ( pmas ) in the wide - field ifu mode ppak .",
    "we present in this paper new results on the kinematics and physical conditions of hh  262 obtained from this ifs observing program .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in  2 .",
    "results are given in   3 : the integrated maps in ",

    "the main conclusions are given ",
    "observations of hh  262 were made on 22 november 2004 with the 3.5-m telescope of the calar alto observatory ( caha ) .",
    "data were acquired with the integral field instrument potsdam multi - aperture spectrophotometer pmas @xcite using the ppak configuration that has 331 science fibres , covering an hexagonal fov of 74@xmath265 arcsec@xmath3 with a spatial sampling of 2.7 arcsec per fibre , and 36 additional fibres to sample the sky ( see fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "the i1200 grating was used , giving an effective sampling of 0.3   pix@xmath5 ( @xmath8 km  s@xmath5 for h@xmath0 ) and covering the wavelength range @xmath97000  , thus including characteristic hh emission lines in this wavelength range ( h@xmath0 , [ nii ]  @xmath106548 , 6584    and [ sii ]   @xmath106716 , 6731  ) . the spectral resolution",
    "( i.e.  instrumental profile ) is @xmath11    fwhm ( @xmath12 km  s@xmath5 ) and the accuracy in the determination of the position of the line centroid is @xmath13    ( @xmath14 km  s@xmath5 for the strong observed emission lines ) .",
    "eight overlapped pointings of 1800-s exposure time each were observed to obtain a mosaic of @xmath1 1.5 @xmath2 3 arcmin@xmath3 to cover almost the entire emission from hh  262 .",
    "note , however , that this mosaic does not cover the extended , arc  shaped emission known as hh  262e , which is most probably related to hh  262 . in table 1",
    "we list the centre positions of each pointing and the corresponding hh  262 knot identification following the nomenclature of @xcite , extended by @xcite .",
    "data reduction was performed using a preliminary version of the r3d software @xcite , in combination with iraf and the euro3d packages @xcite .",
    "the reduction consists of the standard steps for fibre - based integral field spectroscopy .",
    "a master bias frame was created by averaging all the bias frames observed during the night and subtracted from the science frames .",
    "the location of the spectra in the ccd was determined using a continuum - illuminated exposure taken before the science exposures .",
    "each spectrum was extracted from the science frames by co - adding the flux within an aperture of 5 pixels along the cross - dispersion axis for each pixel in the dispersion axis , and stored in a row - stacked - spectrum ( rss ) file @xcite . at the date of the observations we lacked of a proper calibration unit for ppak .",
    "therefore the wavelength calibration was performed iteratively , following all the steps described in @xcite for hhl  73 , another target of our hh ifs survey .",
    "the final wavelength solution was set by using the sky emission lines found in the observed wavelength range .",
    "the accuracy achieved for the wavelength calibration was better than @xmath15   ( @xmath16 km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "observations of a standard star were used to perform a relative flux calibration .",
    "a final datacube containing the 2d spatial plus the spectral information of hh  262 was then created from the 3d data by using euro3d tasks to interpolate the data spatially until reaching a final grid of 2.16 arcsec of spatial sampling and with a spectral sampling of 0.3   .",
    "further manipulation of this datacube , devoted to obtain integrated emission line maps , channel maps and position  velocity maps , were made using several common - users tasks of starlink , iraf and gildas astronomical packages and ida @xcite , an specific idl software to analyse 3d data .",

    "[ mapa ] displays the spectra of the hh  262 knots , obtained in such a way , in the spectral windows covering the h@xmath0 + [ nii ]  ( left panel ) and [ sii ]  ( right panel ) wavelength ranges . in order to make easier comparisons between the lines in the two spectral windows , the intensities in each of the spectra were normalized to the corresponding h@xmath0 peak intensity .",
    "a quick inspection of the spectra in the two spectral windows suggests that the excitation conditions significantly vary from knot to knot .",
    "note in particular that the spectrum extracted at the northern knot ( k18 ) presents the highest [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratio ( this indicating the lowest gas excitation ) .",
    "concerning the line profiles , a more careful inspection of the spectra suggests that the line profiles also vary from knot to knot .",
    "in particular , it can be appreciated that the southern ( k21 , k22 and k26 ) and central ( gh10w - e ) knots show more complex , asymmetric line profiles than the northern ( k18 , k19 ) knots for both the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  lines .",
    "furthermore , in order to better visualize the spectral variations at a smaller spatial scale , both along and across hh  262 , we extracted spectra of individual spaxels for two cuts made along the two main hh  262 axes .",
    "one cut was performed from north to south , intersecting emission from knots k18 , k19 , k20 , gh10e and k22 .",

    "the position where the h@xmath0 emission has the peak , at the central knot gh10e , was set as the origin of positions for referring the location of a given spectrum .",
    "the resulting spectra from these two cuts , in the [ sii ]  window and normalized to their h@xmath0 peak intensities , are displayed in figs .",
    "[ cutv ] and [ cuth ] .",
    "the spectra displayed in these figures suggest there are variations in the kinematics and physical conditions ( excitation and density ) along and across hh  262 even on a short spatial scale ( @xmath18 3 arcsec ) , because we found appreciable differences , both in the line intensity and in the line profiles between the spectra extracted at adjacent spaxels .",
    "in particular , the longitudinal cut ( fig .  [ cutv ] ) shows the already mentioned increasing in the gas excitation as we move from the north to the centre of hh  262 , suggested by the decrease along this direction in the [ sii ]  line intensities relative to h@xmath0 .",
    "this cut also shows that , as a general trend , the line profiles for positions north of the central hh  262 knots are more symmetric and single - peaked as compared with those of the centre and south , where the profiles appear wider , suggesting in some cases a contribution from two velocity components , partially resolved at our spectral resolution .",
    "such a regular trend is not observed in the transversal cut ( fig .  [ cuth ] ) , although the extracted spectra reinforced the finding of the short spatial - scale variation conditions across hh  262 .      as has already been mentioned",
    ", the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  narrow - band images of hh  262 show that the emission from some knots appears split into subcondensations .",
    "furthermore , some knots ( e.g.  k22 and the central gh10e - w knots ) show more complex , asymmetric line profiles , suggesting a contribution from two velocity components at several positions , while the line profiles are found to be more symmetric and single - peaked in the other knots .",
    "thus , in order to characterize better the kinematics and physical conditions in selected hh  262 knots , we also extracted spectra for each knot subcondensation ( see table 3 and fig .",

    "[ sk20 ] , the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  line profiles are both similar for the two subcondensations as well as the velocities derived from the centroid of these lines ( @xmath1 + 60  km  s@xmath5 and + 85  km  s@xmath5 respectively ) . in contrast , a significant change in the [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratios can be appreciated when comparing the spectra of the two k20 subcondensations , which traces an appreciable increase in the gas excitation as we move from north to south by only a few arcsec , suggesting a steep gradient of the gas excitation along k20 . *",
    "* gh9 : * + the ifs data indicate that the northwestern arm of hh  262 ( i.e.  gh9 ) seems to have different physical conditions compared to the other hh  262 knots .",
    "we extracted the spectra for two subcondensations ( gh9w and gh9e ) and also for the lower - brightness shell at the northern gh9 edge ( n - shell ) ( see fig .",
    "[ mapa ] and table  3 for identification ) .",
    "their spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ skgh9 ] . concerning the kinematics , we did not find appreciable differences among the gh9 subcondensations .",
    "the line profiles appear to be single - peaked along the whole of gh9 .",
    "the velocities derived from the line centroids are similar in the n - shell and gh9w , being slightly higher ( by @xmath1 15  km  s@xmath5 ) in gh9e .",
    "in contrast , we can appreciate changes in the physical conditions within gh9 as we move along the knot .",
    "differences in the excitation conditions ( increasing from n - shell , gh9e to gh9w ) are present as the [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratio variations indicate .",
    "furthermore , the electron density also varies from one subcondensation to another . the highest @xmath19 ( @xmath1 1000 @xmath20 ) is found in the n - shell , decreasing to @xmath19 @xmath1 850 @xmath20 ) in gh9w and to @xmath19 @xmath1 600 @xmath20 in gh9e . taking into account",
    "that @xmath19 drop at the centre of hh  262 ( i.e.  around knots gh10e - w ) until reaching values for which the [ sii ]  line ratio is not density sensitive in the central region , we can infer that there is a steep density gradient across hh  262 in the northwest direction . * * k22 : * + k22 is one of the hh  262 knots whose extracted spectrum suggests that the line profiles are double - peaked .",
    "morphologically , the knot appears curved , elongated and quite extended , but split into subcondensations .",
    "we extracted spectra for each of the three bright k22 subcondensations ( k22-n , k22-c and k22-s , the separation between the k22-n and k22-s peaks being @xmath1 10 arcsec ) .",
    "the spectra are shown in fig .",
    "there are appreciable differences in the [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratios among the k22 subcondensations , this being indicative of an increase in the gas excitation as we move from south to north along k22 .",
    "thus , a similar gradient in the gas excitation , but in the opposite direction to that found in k20 , is detected along k22 .",
    "the @xmath19 derived from the [ sii ]  line ratio increases from south to north along k22 , i.e.following the same trend that the gas excitation .",
    "+ concerning the kinematics , both the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  line profiles of the three subcondensations appear asymmetric and would appear to be double - peaked .",
    "we used the [ sii ]  lines to perform a decomposition of the line profiles by applying a model with two gaussian components .",
    "gaussian fitting was perfomed using the dipso package of the starlink astronomical software .",
    "the wavelength difference between the two [ sii ]  lines was fixed according to their corresponding atomic parameters .",
    "the same fwhm of the gaussian in each of the two [ sii ]  lines was assumed for each component of the profile .",
    "according to the fit parameters , we found two velocity components , both redshifted and with a peak separation of @xmath1 50  km  s@xmath5 between them .",
    "for both components , the trend found is the peak velocity increases from the southern to the northern subcondensation .",
    "the strongest component has lower redshifted peak velocities ( @xmath21 from + 55 to + 70  km  s@xmath5 from south to north ) , while the faintest component has higher redshifted peak velocities ( @xmath21 from + 105 to + 120  km  s@xmath5 from south to north ) . in fig .",
    "[ sk22 ] ( right panel ) , we have also drawn the fits to the [ sii]line profiles obtained from the model .",
    "the two individual components are shown at the bottom .",
    "residuals , obtained by subtracting the fit from the observed line , are also plotted . * * gh10 : * + fig .",
    "[ skgh10 ] displays the spectra of the central gh10e ( top ) and gh10w ( bottom ) knots in the h@xmath0+[nii ]  ( left ) and [ sii ]  windows . in the entire area",
    "analysed , the spectra extracted at each spaxel of the region covering these two central knots show broad and asymmetric line profiles , suggesting in most of the positions a double - peaked profile .",
    "we performed the line profile decomposition analysis described above ( k22 subsection ) in all the spaxels of this central region using the [ sii ]  doublet . from the fit",
    ", we found two redshifted velocity components spreading over the whole region , the component with the lower velocity being the strongest .",
    "we were unable to find a clear spatial separation between these two components that would allow the association of each of them with a given region of the central knots .",
    "however , a certain trend appears in which the higher - redshifted component is brighter towards the east of the gh10e knot , having its peak intensity somewhat displaced from the knot centre and showing in addition a secondary peak intensity in a region around the centre of gh10w .",
    "the lower - redshifted velocity component has the peak intensity in the regions located around the centre and southeast of gh10e .",
    "+ we show in fig .  [ skgh10 ] the fits to the [ sii ]  line profiles obtained from the model applied to the spectra , obtained as described in  3.3 , of knots gh10e and gh10w . from the fit parameters",
    ", we found @xmath21 of + 60 and + 120  km  s@xmath5 for the two gh10e components and of + 85 and + 145  km  s@xmath5 for these of gh10w knot .",
    "we have carried out a study of the kinematics and physical conditions of hh  262 based on ifs observations . from the analysis of these data we find :    * hh  262 shows a non - collimated , ",
    "hour - glass  morphology in the h@xmath0 and [ sii ]  lines .",
    "in contrast , the emission from the [ nii ]  lines is below detection limit except in the northwestern knot gh9 .",
    "this work therefore presents the first narrow - band [ nii ]  image currently obtained of hh  262 to show its surprisingly different morphology as compared with the morpholgy found in the other characteristic hh emission lines . * in all the hh",
    "262 knots , radial velocities derived from the line centroids appear redshifted , relative to the cloud velocity .",
    "the highest velocities and fwhm values are found in the central knots . * a more detailed picture of the kinematics",
    "was derived from the channel maps , which shows that the emission spreads over a wide range of velocities , the range slightly varying for the different knots .",
    "furthermore , inspection of the hh  262 extracted spectra shows that there are broad , asymmetric line profiles at the southern ( k22 ) and central knots ( gh10e - w ) that are double - peaked at several positions , which would suggest contribution from two velocity components .",
    "the line profiles appear more symmetric and single - peaked away from the centre , in the northern ( k18k20 ) and northwestern ( gh9 ) knots . * concerning the physical conditions in hh  262 , we found variations on a spatial scale of @xmath183 arcsec ( i.e.  of the order of our spatial resolution ) .",
    "as a general trend , the electron densities , derived from the [ sii ]  line ratios , are low . in particular , only an upper limit could be set for the brightest , central hh  262 knots . because @xmath19 is referred to the density of the ionized gas",
    ", we propose that the only a small fraction of the atomic gas in hh  262 is ionized , the remainder being mostly neutral gas .",
    "it is also plausible that the total density of the gas is lower in this region because the evolved molecular outflow has had enough time to clear the medium . over the entire velocity range of the emission",
    ", the gas excitation , derived from the [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratios , increases as we move towards the western region of knot gh10w and to knot gh9 i.e.  moving towards the edges of hh  262 which are closer to the higher extinction region of the cloud .",
    "the general trend found is thus that the densest knots have the highest gas excitation and the lower centroid velocities .",
    "all these characteristics of hh  262 derived from the ifs data reinforce the causal relationship of the optical line emission with the two molecular outflows ( one powered by l1551-irs5 and the other , by l1551 ne ) found in the region were hh  262 is located .",
    "in fact , is widely accepted the association between hh  262 and the redshifted lobe of the l1551-irs5 molecular outflow , first proposed by @xcite and confirmed later on by the fabry - perot observations @xcite .",
    "detailed pv maps of the l1551-irs5 outflow performed by @xcite from high - sensitivity co observations show a pattern that is characteristic of an evolved molecular outflow , according to current model simulations of the entrainment outflow mechanisms ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the @xcite pv co maps ,",
    "the hh objects are found associated with the molecular emission at the highest velocities , highlighting the interaction regions of the shocks at the head of the shock interface between the supersonic gas and the environment .",
    "in contrast , the co emission at lower velocities appears as a limb - brightened shell - like emission .",
    "thus , the result derived from the @xcite work support the proposed scenario , in which the hh  262 emission traces the walls of a conical cavity evacuated by an evolved molecular outflow ( l1551-irs5 ) .",
    "in such a scenario , one would expect that the hh  262 radial velocities to decrease ( due to projection effects ) as we move away from the axis outflow ( i.e.  from the central gh10 knots , where we found the highest integrated velocities , to the other knots ) .",
    "it is also expected to find double - peaked line profiles along the outflow axis ( corresponding to material moving in the forward and rear faces of the cone ) and a single - peaked profile away from the axis .",
    "such a trend is observed in hh  262 from our ifs data , where the lines of the central knots appear with a complex , asymmetric line profiles , being double - peaked for most positions , while the line profiles of the knots farther away from the outflow axis ( e.g.  k18 , k19 or gh9 ) appear more symmetric and single - peaked .",
    "in addition to the l1551-irs5 outflow , the blueshifted lobe of another younger , dimmer co outflow , powered by l1551 ne , also encompases hh  262 @xcite .",
    "thus , hh  262 is located in a region where two molecular outflows are interacting ( see fig.[diagram1 ] ) and it is expected that this interaction gives signatures on the jet turbulence .",
    "this interaction could in part be responsible for the complex velocity pattern and the wide line profiles found in the optical emission lines . in a turbulent jet scenario ,",
    "the highest fwhm values are expected to be found close to the axis , where there are contributions from gas within a wider range of velocities because we intersect the entire jet beam , while fwhm values would be lower at the edge of the jet , away from the axis .",
    "this is the trend found in the ifs hh  262 data for the fwhms , where the highest values correspond to the central gh10 knots and decrease moving towards the edges of the emission .",
    "the association of hh  262 with an evolved molecular outflow near the edge of a dark cloud would in part justify the low density values derived for most of the knots , as the outflow has cleared the medium .",
    "note however that the density of the gas is probably higher than the density derived from the [ sii ]  line ratio , which is an indicator of only the density of the ionized fraction of the gas rather than of the total density ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , let us discuss the new finding presented here concerning the low intensity of the [ nii ]  emission in hh  262 .",
    "such a behaviour has been found in slow - velocity shocks as those modelled by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the [ nii]/h@xmath0 and [ sii]/h@xmath0 line ratios derived for the knot gh9 are fully compatible with those derived in shock models with @xmath22 @xmath23 3040  km  s@xmath5  occurring in a low density , partially ionized medium .",
    "lower [ nii]/h@xmath0 line ratios ( @xmath23 0.01 ) are found in models with lower @xmath22 ( @xmath18 20 km  s@xmath5  ) , thus being compatible , within the errors , with the marginal detection of [ nii ]  in the northern knots and with the line ratios derived in those knots .",
    "the hh  262 line ratios are also compatible with those predicted by the shock models of @xcite for low magnetic field strength and low ionization fraction values .",
    "note however that the morphology of hh  262 is too complex and rather different from the morphologies found in most known hh jets .",
    "thus , it should not be expected that the radiative planar shock models of @xcite and @xcite succeeded in reproducing all the hh  262 properties derived from the current ifs data .",
    "further ifs observations covering a wavelength range blueward of [ nii ]  + h@xmath0 are needed to search for emission in the [ ni ]  @xmath6 5200 line whose strength could justify the weakness of the [ nii ]  emission found in hh  262 provided the nitrogen abundance were not far from the solar value .",
