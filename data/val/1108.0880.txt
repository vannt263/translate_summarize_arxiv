    "the motivation and concept of measuring @xmath1 and @xmath2 at lhc with the method based on the optical theorem have been discussed at length elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the central equations expressing @xmath1 and @xmath2 in terms of the measured inelastic and elastic rates , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and the extrapolation of the differential elastic rate to the optical point , @xmath6 , are @xmath7 where @xmath8  @xcite will as a first step be taken from theory . at a later stage , a measurement at @xmath3 km can be attempted ( see last section of this article ) .",
    "this article aims at giving an update on the expected performance , taking into account recent studies for the reduced centre - of - mass energy of 7tev and the running experience in 2010 .",
    "the roman pot ( rp ) stations at @xmath9220 m from ip5 and the forward gem telescope t2 had already been fully operational in 2010 , whereas the second half of the rp spectrometer ",
    "i.e. the @xmath9147 m stations  as well as the csc telescope t1 were installed during the technical stop in winter 2010/2011 , thus completing totem s detector apparatus ( figure  [ fig : apparatus ] ) in time for the running season 2011 .",
    "the inelastic trigger acceptance predicted by simulation for the totem detector configuration is given in table  [ tab : triggerlosses ] .",

    "the cross - sections given are the central values of rather wide ranges of predictions  @xcite . _ _ [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the @xmath11 m optics , studied in detail for @xmath12tev  @xcite , extends the measurable @xmath13-range to values of the order @xmath14 and thus enables an elastic extrapolation with an uncertainty at the 0.2% level .",
    "consequently , the precision in @xmath1 improves to @xmath15% .    scaling the optics properties to @xmath10tev shows an even further enhancement of the acceptance reach to low @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig : coulomb ] , bottom block of curves ) .",
    "inserting the rps to 8 or 6 @xmath16 would give access to the elastic scattering zone dominated by the coulomb interaction and thus permit a measurement of @xmath17 , avoiding any need for theoretical input to the @xmath1 determination via the optical theorem . at @xmath12tev",
    "this opportunity will not be offered .",
    "however , the current version of the @xmath18 m optics for totem is only compatible with operation at @xmath19tev to 14tev  @xcite . at lower energy",
    "the two main limiting parameters are the minimum strength allowed in the insertion quadrupoles and the aperture",
    ". one way to avoid these limitations would be to loosen the constraints on the phase advance by abandoning the condition to have `` parallel - to - point focussing '' in both transverse projections .",
    "alternative optics at very high @xmath20 , compatible with operations at @xmath21tev are under study .",
