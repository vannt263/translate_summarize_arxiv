    "the spiking activity also increases the level of residual calcium , which controls the noisy , asynchronous releases of the neural transmitters leading to the reverberation in a burst .",
    "apart from making the role of synchronous releases more important in the activation of neurons , the depletion also leads to longer recovery time of neural transmitters .",
    "coupling with the rapid decay of calcium between the reverberation peaks , this leads to the lowing in the mean level of residual calcium towards the end of a burst .",

    ", at play in the cultured network with the reverberatory bursts .",
    "in such a burst , the initiation activity is a fast sweeping wave of propagating spikes across the network that is well synchronized .",
    "this activity produces a significant amount of residual calcium , promoting noisy asynchronous releases , and prompting the spontaneous firing of the neurons that results in the subsequent reverberation of the burst .",
    "initially , the spontaneous spikes are more or less independent and the heterogeneity in the neurons and their connectivity makes the spike - rate peaks broad and less synchronous .",
    "however , as the neural and synaptic resources are increasingly depleted by the continuing spiking activity of the burst , it becomes harder for the neurons to fire independently and they thus increasingly rely on the synchronous releases triggered by the firing of their presynaptic neurons to help them cross the firing threshold .",
    "such mechanism accounts for the observed increase of evoked spikes and the synchrony in fig .",

    "it is known that activities similar to what we reported here can also be induced in acute slice @xcite when inhibitory interactions are blocked . presumably , there are too many recurrent connections in our cultures which might correspond to the pathological condition during epilepsy @xcite",
