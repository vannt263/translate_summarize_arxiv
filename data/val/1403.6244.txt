    "magnetar \" concept and discussed the formation of a magnetar .",

    "@xcite , combined with results from subsequent papers ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) on other sources , was regarded as substantial evidences for magnetar model . @xcite",

    "@xcite developed an accretion disk model for axps / sgrs , whereby the emission is powered by accretion from a fossil disk .",
    "@xcite deduced there might be a disk around from the spectral - energy distribution in the optical / infrared band , where the disk may come from a supernova fallback .",
    "the accretion - based models were usually criticized because of the lack of a mechanism to explain the giant flares and bursts .",
    "thus , these models require input from the magnetar model to become a  hybrid \" and complete model @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , combining the accretion model and strange matter state , xu and coworkers @xcite suggested that the solid quark stars , instead of neutron stars , could generate giant flares and bursts in the process of accretion - induced star - quakes .",
    "massive white dwarfs with larger rotational energy release than neutron stars are also regarded as an alternative model for axps / sgrs @xcite .    comparing the magnetar model and the accretion model ,",

    ", @xcite and @xcite studied the continuum of persistent radiation and weak burst spectra of and from _ suzaku _ observations .",

    "it is also one of the most energetic sources among all axps / sgrs , with an outburst lasting @xmath21 . in december 2004 , it showed the third giant flare @xcite ever observed in sgrs , releasing @xmath22 during @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ monitored the source for about 10 years and observed its entire outburst variation .",

    "_ xmm - newton _ has one observation for each outburst , respectively .",
    "was discovered on 2008 - 8 - 22 when it entered its first outburst @xcite .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ observations of this source began on 2008 - 8 - 23 , showing an entire outburst decay similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data from the detector pn on board _ xmm - newton _",
    ", since it has the highest time resolution in imaging mode among all three soft x - ray detectors .",
    "almost all of the observations are in the imaging modes , only one observation for is in timing mode .",
    "we only used the data in imaging mode , to make the results from different observations comparable .",
    "we obtained time - tagged events ( tte ) data from circular source regions with radii of @xmath24 centered on the sources positions and performed background subtraction using another circle regions with radii of @xmath25 aside these sources . using these tte data , we located the non - piled - up short bursts by the bayesian blocks algorithm .",
    "the details about the bayesian blocks algorithm will be discussed in section 3 .",
    "since the count rates of some bursts are high , the pileup effect must be considered to ensure the precision of burst spectra .",
    "considering the lack of photons for some bursts , two different ways were used to detect pileup for bursts with @xmath26 counts and those with @xmath27 counts .",
    "for the former bursts , results from _ epatplot _ in _ xmm - sas _ were used to determine the presence of pileup .",
    "we used the single pattern fractions between the observed data and models given by _",
    "xmm - sas_. the bursts with the fractions of 0.950 to 1.050 were marked as non - piled - up bursts , while others were filtered out of burst data as piled - up bursts .",
    "in the normal case ( with enough photons ) , this fraction should not be much larger than 1 , since pileup only lowers this fraction . but considering the uncertainty in the statistics of observed patterns , this fraction can be quite large , like @xmath28 .",
    "we excluded these bursts with larger fractions , mainly because they deviate from the model significantly , which reflects some anomalies in observed pattern distribution .",
    "we counted the photons in single ( @xmath29 ) , double ( @xmath30 ) , triple ( @xmath31 ) and quadruple ( @xmath32 ) patterns for bursts which lack photons .",
    "then we calculated the ratio ( @xmath33 ) , where @xmath34 represents the number of anomalous photons .",
    "the burst with ratio larger than 0.1 are regarded as a piled - up burst .",
    "the burst detection results without pileup are shown in table [ shortburst ] .    in order to compute the flux and luminosity",
    ", we fitted the persistent spectrum for each observation and burst spectra for the observations with more than 50 burst photons . according to the former works @xcite , we adopted an absorbed black body plus power law ( * phabs(bbodyrad+powerlaw ) * in xspec ) for the persistent emissions and a single absorbed black body for bursts .",
    "the bb+pl model is a simplified phenomenological model for the persistent emission of axps / sgrs which assumes the emission is the sum of a blackbody from a hot spot on the stellar surface and a non - thermal component enhanced by resonant cyclotron scattering .",
    "in some observations of our targets , a single blackbody component can not account for the burst spectra , so we added a second blackbody component when modeling these spectra .",
    "the photoelectric absorption parameter @xmath35 was fixed using the value from magnetar catalog @xcite shown in table [ param ] , except for in the modeling of the data shown in table [ spec0501 ] . in the spectra",
    "fitting , the background spectra are different for the persistent spectra and the burst spectra . for persistent spectra , the background spectra are extracted from the background sky described above . for the burst spectra , we employed the persistent spectra as their background spectra .",
    "examples of the persistent and the burst spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ specurve ] , respectively . after the spectral fitting ,",
    "the _ cflux _ in xspec was used to calculate the unabsorbed flux in the energy band of @xmath36 and the error with a 90% confidence range . to obtain the luminosity in the same band",
    ", we used the distances in table [ param ] .",
    "the results are listed in table [ shortburst ]   -   table [ spec0501 ] .",
    "because high - rated piled - up bursts have been excluded , the obtained burst fluxes should be lower than the real ones for observations containing piled - up bursts . besides pileup effect , high count rates might cause telemetry saturation .",
    "telemetry saturation had two origins : short bursts and soft proton flares ( spfs ) .",
    "spfs have been filtered out using the background light curves , so the telemetry saturation related to spfs only makes observation time equivalently shorter .",
    "however , the telemetry saturation caused by short bursts would decrease burst fluxes because of the zero - rated intervals ( gaps ) when the detector switched into timing mode . combining these two effects together ,",
    "it is clear that we obtained lower limits on the burst fluxes and unbiased persistent fluxes .",
    "in the bayesian blocks algorithm , the optimal block partition is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function ( @xmath37 ) @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the total number of photons , the expected count rate , and the duration of the block @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "the algorithm depends on the prior blocks distribution index ( @xmath41 ) and false positive probability @xmath42 .",
    "we utilized the equation ( 21 ) in @xcite ( @xmath43 ) to determine @xmath41 and chose 0.05 as the default value of @xmath42 .",
    "although the time complexity has been reduced to @xmath20 @xcite , it is still an unacceptable computing time if we apply the bayesian blocks algorithm to the entire observation . to reduce the time complexity again , we divided the entire observation into several segments of equal length . for different sources , we defined the length as the mean photon counts received in @xmath44 , but at least 100 counts .    to decrease the effect of the different separations , we set two rounds of detection .",
    "the first round started from the beginning of the observation , and the second round was a half separation postponed relative to the first one .",
    "for each round , we applied the bayesian blocks algorithm to each segment , and we obtained the raw change points .",
    "if one change point was also a discontinuity points we set in the separations , we used the two segments before and after it to determine whether it was a change point or not .",
    "we merged the two round results together and calculated the final rate for each block .",
    "we defined the blocks longer than double periods of the source as the background blocks , and we amalgamated the background blocks to estimate the background count rate level .",
    "the gaps in data set were regarded as blocks with zero rates by the bayesian blocks algorithm , and we excluded them out from the background rate computation .",
    "subsequently , we tagged the blocks with rates higher than that of the background as short burst blocks .",
    "an example of the results from the bayesian blocks algorithm is shown in fig .",
    "[ example ] .",
    "all background blocks for each observation were collected to constitute the persistent data , while the burst blocks were collected as the burst data .",
    "after locating the short bursts , we made the duration distributions for , and .",

    "since the bayesian block algorithm has some prior parameters , we get a different bursts sample compared to @xcite . however , considering the uncertainties , our results are consistent with @xcite .",
    "we noticed that the bursts are mainly dominated by the short time scale bursts ( @xmath10 ) in and , while the long time scale bursts ( @xmath71 ) are in the majority in . to investigate the spectral properties of short time scale bursts and long time scale bursts",
    ", we divided the bursts into two subclasses at 0.2 s for , since has enough burst photons for spectral fitting and @xmath72 is the approximate intersecting point of these two components .",

    "the main difference is the normalization , which is the emission areas for bb+bb model or the densities of plasma for ottb .",
    "our results show that the spectrum of shorter bursts have larger normalization in both models .",
    "waiting time is the interval between two adjacent short bursts . here , we only considered the waiting time between two adjacent non - piled - up bursts .",
    "for these three sources , the waiting times range from several seconds to several hours . nevertheless , the obtained waiting times are just the phenomenological ones , since we do nt have effective means to determine whether a burst is single burst or multi - peaked burst . using these raw waiting times",

    "considering the relationship between the burst strength and the waiting time , our results show that there is no apparent correlation , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we noticed that the persistent flux experienced a decay , while the average burst flux showed fluctuation due to the giant flare .",
    "after the giant flare , the burst flux became much lower than earlier epoch within three months . during the next two years , it remained at its low burst rate condition until the late in 2006 .",
    "after a weak peak around mjd 54000 , the burst flux entered into another decay stage . mainly using the data from _ rxte _ , @xcite showed the evolution of the frequency , frequency derivative and the burst number per @xmath90 days .",
    "however , their data did not cover the burst peak around mjd 54000 .",
    "the persistent flux of showed a decay @xcite , while the average burst flux showed a steeper drop to the bottom .",
    "we separated the first observation into four segments .",
    "the persistent flux did not change significantly , while the average burst flux had an apparent peak at the second segment .",
    "the flux evolution of this source did not show a decay stage as and , because _ xmm - newton _ did not have enough observations .",
    "have experienced two outbursts in 2002 - 2004 and 2007 @xcite , so the flux variance showed a comparison between the outburst and the quiescent period .",

    "the bayesian blocks method checks each count recorded by the detector and determines whether it is a change point , which means that the time resolution for each block could reach the limit of the detector .",
    "thus , the beginning and the end of each burst could also be determined in this precision , which makes it possible to analyze the duration of bursts precisely .",

    "we regard the modeling of waiting time as a possible evidence to this conclusion .",
    "@xcite first showed the waiting time distribution of sgr and compared it from with the cases in earthquake . @xcite and @xcite showed that the waiting time distribution may be fitted by a lognormal function for and .",
    "however , there is an unexpected bump in the short time scale of the distribution .",

    ", the possibility can not be ruled out that our samples are completed in this energy band ( @xmath116 ) for and , which do not have weaker bursts . however , the possibility is quite limited , considering the fact that the count rates for these two sources are only @xmath117 , and that waiting times we got in are @xmath118 times longer than the ones in @xcite .",
    "the spectra were also analyzed for long and short time scale bursts , using the first observation from . in our results",
    ", this observation contains the most burst photons and could be divided easily into two components with little interlock .",
    "we chose two models , two black bodies and ottb , in our burst spectra fitting .",
    "two black bodies model is one of the simplest model and widely used in burst spectra fitting @xcite .",
    "@xcite analyzed an intermediate burst from and found that two black bodies model could provide an acceptable fit to both time resolved spectra and integrated spectrum .",
    "they attributed the higher temperature component to multi - temperature trapped fireball and regarded the lower one as the emission from star surface .",
    "@xcite suggested that the higher temperature component came from the surface of neutron star , while the lower one was emitted from a magnetospheric region . ignoring the mechanism , double black bodies model could provide acceptable fits with reduced @xmath119 to the burst spectra for both shorter and longer burst in our work .",
    "we also used an alternative model ( ottb ) to fit the burst spectra .",
    "this model is also widely used in the burst spectra fitting in axps / sgrs , but it is not always effective @xcite .",
    "however , it works well in our burst spectra fitting too .",
    "thus , we examined the chosen burst spectra using two universal models and both models works well judged by reduced @xmath119 .",
    "these two models reflect different physical processes and we can not claim which is the truth on the surface of axps / sgrs . fortunately ,",
    "in both of these two models , the characteristic parameters , black body temperature or plasma temperature , show negligible variety in the error range . in that case , we prefer to regard that the two classes bursts we divided originate from the same resource , but how could the two time scale bursts be generated is still an issue to be considered .    the relationships between the short bursts and the persistent emission were analyzed to find hints for the energy origin of axps / sgrs .",
    "we show a power law with @xmath120 between the luminosity of persistent emission and burst . in accretion model , this phenomenon is natural , since the persistent radiation represents the accretion rate , while the burst radiation represents the consumption rate of the accreted matter .",
    "considering the an equilibrium condition during an observation , the positive correlation is apparent between the accretion rate and the consumption rate , which results in the positive relationship between the luminosity of persistent emission and burst . in the magnetar model ,",
    "this phenomenon is also natural .",
    "both the persistent emission and the bursts are from the magnetic energy . during an outburst",
    ", some seismic activities may trigger magnetic reconnections or crystal fractures , which are responsible for the short bursts @xcite . during this process",
    ", the magnetosphere will become more twisted .",
    "the corresponding persistent flux will also increase @xcite .",
    "we also introduced the energy ratio ( @xmath102 ) from type x - ray bursts to judge the energy release in axps / sgrs .",
    "in type x - ray bursts , the range of this ratio covers from several tens to @xmath121 and does not vary with the persistent luminosity @xcite .",
    "this character is regarded as a strong evidence for the nuclear burning model .",
    "we show that the energy ratios in axps / sgrs have the similar statistic character with the ones in type x - ray bursts .",
    "considering that burst fluxes we got are lower limits , the energy ratio we got is the upper limit of the real one .",
    "the energy ratios in our sample cover from @xmath118 to @xmath122 , which is comparable with in type x - ray bursts .",
    "however , the nuclear burning model is not so suitable for axps / sgrs based on two reasons .",
    "on one hand , axps / sgrs are isolated stars without apparent accretion . on the other hand ,",
    "the time scale of short bursts is much shorter than the prediction in nuclear burning model . in type",
    "x - ray bursts , the energy ratio can be calculated for each burst , while in axps / sgrs , this ratio can only be analyzed for a long period with many bursts . although the ratios in type x - ray bursts and axps / sgrs are different , they both show that there should be a connection between the energy origin of persistent radiation and the resource of bursts .",
