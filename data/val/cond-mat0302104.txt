    "the ideal quantum computer @xcite , if it exists , is a very interesting object from a physical point of view .",
    "it is a system which may be prepared in any superposition of @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 ) basic states during a very long time without decoherence . to give an order of magnitude",
    ", the decoherence should be much smaller than @xmath2 after a characteristic time scale of one operation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should allow a set of controlled unitary operations with an accuracy of @xmath2 or better .",
    "it is natural to think that in order to satisfy these stringent criteria one needs to have a physical system in which decoherence and errors generated by manipulations are exponentially small with respect to the system size or to any other control parameter .",
    "we shall refer to such properties as  ideal \" in the following .",
    "the requirement of an ideal decoherence can be achieved in physical systems with topological order parameters @xcite which can be implemented in josephson - junction arrays @xcite .",
    "however , the physical arrays proposed so far do not allow the ideal implementation of the full set of operations @xcite required for quantum computations .",
    "in fact , these arrays allow to perform ideally only the simplest operations : a flip of an individual bit and the change of the wave function phase by @xmath3 . it is crucial that they do not allow precise operations that mix the classical states , e.g. , the hadamard rotation @xmath4 that transforms the states @xmath5 , @xmath6 into their mixtures @xmath7 requires an application of the correct external perturbation @xmath8 for a given time @xmath9 : @xmath10 and thus is subjected to errors in both the values of @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "generally , an ideal operation involves an adiabatic change of some parameters that results in a generalized berry s phase .",
    "note that all alternative ways to operate the qubit are similar to a spin rotation in an external field .",
    "such operations are not adiabatic and are controlled by the duration of the field pulse which can never be made precise .",
    "in fact , it is very difficult to imagine how one can possibly achieve the accuracy of the transformation that is needed for quantum computation with this technique .",
    "in contrast , adiabatic transformations can be made , in principle , very precise .",
    "the main difficulty with them is to find a system in which the group formed by these transformation is big enough for a quantum computation .",
    "the arrays discussed above are implementing the symmetry group @xmath11 and thus it is not surprising that for them adiabatic changes of the external parameters allow only a very limited set of operations .",
    "one expects , following the suggestion by kitaev @xcite , that one would get much larger sets of operations in systems allowing more complicated local symmetry transformations , in particular , in the case of discrete non - abelian groups @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to consider lattice gauge theories built on more complicated groups than @xmath11 and to identify some that allow nontrivial adiabatic transformations .",
    "after having described the most promising ones , we discuss how they can be implemented , at least , in principle , in josephson - junction arrays .",
    "all solid - state physics implementations of lattice gauge theories involve a lattice in real space but imply a continuous time .",
    "the natural framework to describe such models and their experimental realizations is the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "this calls for an explicitly time - independent dynamics which can be achieved by choosing the scalar part of the gauge field @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", the vector part @xmath13 describes the quantum state of the physical links .",
    "however , the hamiltonian thus constructed still commutes with the large group of local time - independent gauge transformations .",
    "it is then convenient to use a description which keeps track only of the underlying physical degrees of freedom .",
    "this can be done by restricting the hilbert space to the space of gauge - invariant states .",
    "note that several studies have already pointed out the existence of close connections between josephson - junction arrays , lattice gauge theories and generalized statistics for elementary excitations .",
    "for instance , incompressible phases analogous to the fractional quantum hall fluids ( fqhf ) of two - dimensional electronic systems have been predicted and studied in such arrays .",
    "one of them may be viewed as a fqhf of charges @xcite induced by an external magnetic field , whereas the other involves a fqhf of vortices @xcite in the presence of a uniform fractional background charge on the superconducting islands .",
    "an appealing synthesis of these possible phases in the language of lattice gauge theories has been developed in ref .",
    "as we shall show in detail , the lattice gauge models discussed here have the main advantage over the previous ones that effective interactions between elementary excitations are purely of statistical origin , and do not , for instance , depend on their precise locations .",
    "this is , of course , highly desirable in the context of quantum computation where the goal is to implement , with high accuracy , a set of universal unitary transformations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ cgt ] , we review basic notions of continuous gauge groups and introduce basic notations .",
    "we emphasize the connection between the gauge - invariance constraint imposed on the physical states and the gauss law constraint .",
    "special features arising for non - abelian groups are discussed .",
    "section [ dagt ] focusses on the abelian cyclic @xmath14 group . in this case , we show that imposing a local constraint on the product of group elements along the links of elementary plaquettes ( kinematical gauss law ) is equivalent , after a duality transformation , to the requirement of local gauge invariance .",
    "we briefly discuss implementations of these two versions of @xmath14 models in josephson - junction arrays and the existence of a topologically protected ground state when arrays exhibit macroscopic holes .",
    "section [ dnagt ] addresses the interesting case of theories associated with a finite non - abelian group .",
    "in this situation , the usual local gauge - invariance constraint and the kinematical gauss law constraint have to be treated separately , since no exact duality transformation is available to connect them .",
    "we show that both models present gapped low - energy excitations called fluxons which may be trapped in macroscopic holes of the arrays .",
    "we also discuss local violations of the constraints called pseudocharges , and show the existence of a non - abelian aharonov - bohm effect as a pseudocharge winds around a fluxon ( and conversely ) .",
    "section [ implementations ] is dedicated to implementations of these two models , for the simplest non - abelian groups such as the dihedral groups @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "these proposals are based on the frustrated josephson - junction arrays , where some basic elements have a @xmath17 periodic potential energy as a function of the phase difference across them .",
    "the computations of the various energy scales driving the physical properties of these arrays , are presented in four appendixes .",
    "let us start by a brief review of the properties of lattice gauge theories with continuous groups using the language that will be convenient for the discussion of discrete groups .",
    "therefore , we consider a hamiltonian @xmath18 and a hilbert space that are invariant under the local gauge transformations built from a continuous group @xmath19 .    more precisely , to any set of group elements @xmath20 s labeled by lattice sites , we associate the transformation @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , and @xmath23=0 $ ] . for a given lattice , the gauge field @xmath24 is attached to the links and takes its values in the group @xmath19 .",
    "local gauge transformations are then given by @xmath25 in the familiar example of compact quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xmath26 , @xmath27 and gauge transformation in the variables ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) acquires a well - known form @xmath30 . identifying quantum states @xmath31 with functions @xmath32 of classical field configurations @xmath33 , the condition of gauge invariance can be explicitly written as @xmath34 for any choice of @xmath35 s .",
    "in particular , we may choose transformations localized on a single site @xmath36 , so that @xmath37",
    "if @xmath38 and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes the neutral element in the group @xmath19 . furthermore , since @xmath19 is a continuous group , it is possible to consider infinitesimal @xmath41 s .",
    "the constraint of local gauge invariance ( [ gaugeinv ] ) can then be expressed as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the generator of the lie group corresponding to the direction @xmath44 in the vicinity of the neutral element of @xmath19 . in the following",
    ", the notation @xmath45 stands for all sites @xmath46 connected to @xmath36 .",
    "the operator conjugated to @xmath43 is analogous to an electric field @xmath47 . in the basis where the electrical field @xmath48 is diagonal , eq .",
    "( [ gauss ] ) becomes a lattice equivalent of the usual gauss law @xmath49 which also reads @xmath50 where we have set @xmath51 , @xmath9 being an arbitrary real parameter .",
    "notice that each site of the lattice corresponds to plaquette of the dual lattice , and the product over the links emanating from a site becomes a product over the links encircling the corresponding plaquette of the dual lattice .",
    "this allows for a natural realization of conditions ( [ gaugeinv ] ) and ( [ discretegauss ] ) in physical systems .    at this stage , it is very important to point out a deep difference between abelian and non - abelian groups . in the former case , we may diagonalize simultaneously all the generators @xmath52 since they mutually commute , which is impossible in the non - abelian case .",
    "because of this , we shall explore two different routes in this work .",
    "a natural possibility is to regard eq .",
    "( [ gaugeinv ] ) as the basic equation , and as we shall show , it is easy to use this construction for _ discrete _ non - abelian groups .",
    "a second approach is to take eq .",
    "( [ discretegauss ] ) as the most fundamental . in this case",
    ", we assume that the physical states are also generated by classical configurations of group elements @xmath52 attached to the links , and we require these classical configurations to satisfy the _ kinematical _ constraint @xmath53 note that in this new scheme , and if @xmath19 is non - abelian , we can no longer interpret this modified gauss law as a consequence of a local gauge symmetry .",
    "so , these two approaches yield essentially different theories , except in the abelian case where their equivalence can be precisely established as explained in the following section .",
    "let us start with the usual abelian case and consider more specifically a simple example where the discrete gauge group is the cyclic group @xmath14 , which has also the major advantage that it can be easily realized in a physical system .",
    "indeed , this can be implemented with josephson - junction elements for which the josephson hamiltonian is @xmath54 periodic in the phase difference @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the phase of the superconducting order parameter at site @xmath57 .",
    "we discuss the actual construction of such elements in sec .",
    "[ implementations ] . due to this @xmath58-periodicity",
    "each link has @xmath59 degenerate ground states characterized by an integer , @xmath60 which is defined by @xmath61 we would like to stress that this type of system exhibits a _",
    "local _ @xmath14 symmetry defined by @xmath62 with integers @xmath63 . since we are dealing with quantum systems , it is also natural to interpret this symmetry in a basis which diagonalizes the local particle number operators conjugated to the phase operators .",
    "this symmetry then simply means that the particle number on each lattice site is conserved modulo @xmath59 .",
    "an explicit realization for the @xmath64 case has been recently proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in real systems , charging energies induce quantum fluctuations of the phase variables .",
    "tunneling processes between the various degenerate classical ground states discussed above appear and usually lift completely this classical degeneracy .",
    "physical properties in the low - energy subspace spanned by these classical ground states are then well described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the physical lattice . in order to give a concrete illustration",
    ", we work on the geometry displayed in fig .",

    "each bond represents a superconducting element which is @xmath17 periodic in the phase difference @xmath74 .",
    "the state of each bond is described by the discrete variable @xmath73 according to eq .",
    "( [ delta_phi_ab ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the state of the bond can be described by the variable @xmath75 defined on the links of the dual ( triangular ) lattice @xmath67 .",
    ", width=192 ]    in this case , the hamiltonian @xmath76 is easily diagonalizable since its eigenstates are  plane waves \" @xmath77 and its eigenenergies are given by @xmath78 for @xmath79 . here , we have chosen tunneling amplitudes @xmath70 equal to @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 otherwise .",
    "thus the ground state @xmath83 is given by a configuration such that @xmath84 for all @xmath57 .",
    "although this model is very easy to solve since it only involves single - site operators which mutually commute , it is very fruitful to map it onto a genuine local gauge theory also based on the @xmath14 group .",
    "indeed , this mapping provides a convenient way to treat physical external perturbations which are coupled to link variables .",
    "this construction is based on a description of physical states in terms of the link variables @xmath73 .",
    "the crucial observation is that these variables are not independent as soon as there are loops on the lattice .",
    "more precisely , the sum of the integers @xmath73 s along any oriented loop is constrained to vanish modulo @xmath59 . a natural basis for our system",
    "is given by states of the form @xmath85 , where the @xmath73 s satisfy the constraint . in the following , we shall refer to the description in terms of the @xmath72 s as  site \" representation , and to the latter ( in terms of the @xmath73 s ) as the  link \" representation .",
    "this condition on the @xmath73 s can be easily interpreted as the gauss law for an abelian gauge theory on the dual lattice . to show this , it is convenient to change the basis via the fourier transform @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an integer chosen modulo @xmath59 .",
    "in this basis , a state @xmath88 is an eigenvector for the translation operators @xmath89 with the eigenvalue @xmath90 which provides a simple implementation of these operators in terms of the original fields .",

    "the last stage of the mapping onto a @xmath14 gauge theory consists in expressing everything on the dual lattice .",
    "any link @xmath99 on @xmath66 separates two plaquettes which correspond to sites @xmath36 and @xmath46 of @xmath67 .",
    "the oriented links of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are thus in one to one correspondence .",
    "it is then possible to transform the @xmath98 s into the @xmath100 s , and similarly the @xmath101 s into the @xmath102 s .",
    "we then recover the gauss law written as @xmath103 in other words , invariance of physical states under @xmath104 is equivalent to the requirement of invariance under the transformations @xmath105 for any pairs of neighboring sites @xmath36 and @xmath46 belonging to @xmath67 , and any integers @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this is exactly the equivalent of condition ( [ gaugeinv ] ) for a gauge theory associated with the group @xmath14 on the dual lattice where the gauge  fields \" are the @xmath100 s .",
    "the simplest hamiltonian invariant under these transformations reads @xmath108 the first term gives quantum dynamics to the links and is equivalent to @xmath109 .",
    "the second term @xmath110 describes perturbations which lift the degeneracy between the classical ground states . in the physical implementations in josephson - junction arrays discussed in more detail below , it is usually due to the unprecise value of the flux through the elementary plaquette .",

    "matter appears in this effective theory if one allows sites of the dual lattice where constraint ( [ constraint2 ] ) is violated . in terms of the physical josephson - junction system , it means that we have plaquettes of the physical lattice @xmath66 where the sum of the superconducting phases is different from @xmath82 , that is vortices in the superconducting phase .",
    "notice that due to @xmath17 periodicity these vortices carry @xmath135 flux quanta .",
    "thus , it is natural to introduce sites @xmath36 where @xmath136 $ ] . in the gauge field language",
    ", it implies that gauge transformation at these sites changes the wave function of the gauge field according to @xmath137 meaning that , at these sites , there is a pseudocharge @xmath135 . in order to create such an excitation above the ground state",
    ", one needs to apply operators @xmath138 along an open string on the dual lattice @xmath67 . because of the presence of this string",
    ", it is in general necessary to consider globally neutral charge configurations .",
    "this arises because the product of all the generators @xmath139 over all sites @xmath36 is the identity operator , or equivalently because global gauge transformations do not modify the link variables @xmath100 .",
    "when such a pseudocharge moves around a fluxon , it undergoes an aharonov - bohm effect with a dephasing @xmath140 .",
    "this is a natural result for a josephson - junction array where a fluxon carries a physical charge @xmath134 and where a pseudocharge is a superconducting vortex with flux quanta @xmath141 .",
    "the same result is obtained if we move a fluxon around a fixed pseudocharge as in the aharonov - casher effect . a more detailed discussion of this phenomenon is given in the context of non - abelian gauge theories in sec .",
    "[ dnagt ] .",
    "the classification of the excited states as fluxons and pseudocharges is meaningful if these charges are rare .",
    "this is indeed the case if the energy needed to create a vortex of the superconducting order parameter ( which becomes pseudocharge in the gauge theory language ) is large compared with the coulomb energy and also with the energy scale @xmath80 of phase fluctuations .",
    "consider qualitatively the opposite case in which the tunneling amplitude @xmath80 is large compared to the potential energy of vortices and to their kinetic energy @xmath9 . in a physical josephson - junction array , this can be realized by constructing the links of the lattice from rhombi @xcite connected in series to an additional weak josephson junction such that its josephson energy @xmath142 and its charging energy @xmath143 satisfy @xmath144 and @xmath145 @xcite . in these conditions all energy scales associated with weak junctions ( @xmath143 , @xmath142 , vortex tunneling amplitude @xmath9 ) are small compared to @xmath80 .",
    "thus , in the leading approximation one can neglect the dynamics of the weak junctions and their contribution to the potential energy .",
    "the leading process remains the simultaneous flip of three adjacent rhombi described by the first term of the hamiltonian ( [ h_abelian1 ] ) .",
    "the condition @xmath146 $ ] no longer holds because weak links favor the spontaneous excitation of vortices .",
    "instead , it is replaced by the condition that all low - energy states have to minimize the kinetic energy part of the hamiltonian ( [ h_abelian1 ] ) , i.e. , to satisfy @xmath147 this condition can be viewed as a gauss law imposed on the sites of the physical lattice under the gauge group generated by @xmath148 [ cf .",
    "( [ constraint2 ] ) ] . in these conditions ,",
    "the physical array is expected to be in the insulating regime .",
    "it is therefore natural that the discrete version ( [ gauss_ins ] ) of the qed gauge invariance ( [ gauss ] ) should be restored .",
    "formally , the states satisfying the gauge - invariance condition ( [ gauss_ins ] ) are described by the same theory as the states satisfying eq .",
    "( [ constraint2 ] ) but the physical meaning of all quantities is reversed .",
    "fluxons correspond now to the fractional vortices in the superconducting phase , while pseudocharges become the physical charges of the insulating array ( modulo @xmath59 ) .",
    "finally , note that the degenerate states appearing in arrays with a nontrivial topology are distinguished by the product of @xmath138 operators taken over paths defined on the dual lattice .    to conclude this section",
    ", we emphasize that when the gauge group is abelian , there is a duality between the theory defined on the  real lattice \" and the theory defined on its dual .",
    "this correspondence is established via the fourier transform which relates the variables @xmath149 and @xmath87 defined on the real and on the dual lattices , respectively .",

    "the transition between states with @xmath463 appears naturally if the energies of the classical minima with different @xmath464 are not exactly equal because , in the momentum representation , this induces a transition between these states .",

    "we emphasize again that the low - energy sector has to be separated from higher - energy excitations by a large gap @xmath468 .",
    "in this work , we have proposed several possible implementations of lattice models based on discrete non - abelian local symmetry groups .",
    "the first key ingredient in all these constructions is the existence of a large but discrete manifold of equivalent  classical \" states .",
    "this manifold appears if the system is built from heavily frustrated elementary blocks , such as josephson - junction loops threaded by a well adjusted magnetic flux .",
    "further , one needs to select an interaction between these blocks that imposes a set of local constraints in the low - energy sector .",
    "we have found two inequivalent ( but somewhat similar ) types of constraints compatible with the non - abelian symmetry group .",
    "the first type of constraint corresponds to the dynamical selection of the states which are invariant under the gauge group transformations .",
    "this is most naturally implemented in insulating arrays where it can be made equivalent to the selection of states that minimize the kinetic energy associated with the local tunneling processes between classically equivalent states .",
    "the second type of constraint emerges more naturally in superconducting josephson - junction arrays ( or the ones with small phase fluctuations ) , where group elements associated with the bonds can be viewed as transformations between the states of the sites of the array . because the state of each site is uniquely defined , the product of group elements around a closed loop is the unit element .",
    "we have called this condition a kinematical gauss law .",
    "this constraint becomes equivalent to the local gauge - invariance condition in abelian theories where a duality transformation maps one onto the other ( sec . [ dagt ] ) but for a non - abelian symmetry it leads to a different theory in which the roles of charges and fluxons have been reversed ( sec .",

    "the elementary excitations within the constrained subspace are local in space and have a finite - energy gap .",
    "we call these excitations  fluxons \" .",
    "generally , these fluxons can be trapped inside a larger hole prepared in the array leading to a degenerate ground state in the thermodynamic limit . in a finite system , this degeneracy is lifted by an exponentially weak tunneling escape process .",
    "it is also robust with respect to all noises represented by local operators such as local electric fields ( generated by stray charges ) or stray magnetic fluxes : the matrix elements of all these operators are exponentially suppressed .",
    "this remarkable property may open the way to the interesting applications such as storage of quantum information for which a low decoherence rate is a must .",
    "we emphasize that the physical nature of these fluxons depends , however , on the details of implementation and the type of the constraint : the canonical gauge invariance is more easily implemented in insulating arrays in which fluxons have the physical meaning of fractional vortices while kinematical gauss law is more naturally implemented in superconducting arrays in which fluxons carry physical charges .",
    "besides fluxons , in any physical array , it is possible to build excitations that violate a local constraint ( of course , at some energy cost ) ; in the gauge theory language these excitations are pseudocharges . in the canonical gauge models",
    "pseudocharges may provide a multidimensional representation of the discrete gauge group while fluxons are labeled by their conjugacy classes . in the kinematical gauss law models the role of fluxons and pseudocharges",
    "is reversed .",
    "the existence of these higher - dimensional representations leads to a very interesting statistical interaction between fluxons and pseudocharges which may be utilized for making exact transformations needed in quantum computations .",

    "such an array would be more experimentally accessible and easier to control . coming back to the proposed arrays it would be very interesting to investigate the experimental manifestations of the nonlocal nature of the fluxon quantum numbers which become apparent only when a few of them are present . as discussed extensively in the mathematical literature @xcite , these quantum numbers interpolate between a set of conjugacy classes ( one for each fluxon ) and a set of group elements ( which is not a gauge - invariant object by itself ) .",
    "it would be important to realize how these subtle but beautiful concepts can be revealed in a physical experiment , and to design some setup that could verify the non - abelian statistics of the excitations in these models . finally , it would be very interesting to adapt the construction of the chern - simons term ( which binds fluxons and charges ) known for a continuous groups to the discrete finite gauge groups ( even abelian ones ) discussed here and to provide a corresponding physical implementation .",
