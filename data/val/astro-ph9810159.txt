    ", a reasonable assumption is made that the co emission is optically thick and thermalized , and that it originates in gravitationally bound molecular clouds .",
    "thus , the ratio of the h@xmath3 mass and the co luminosity is given by , @xmath48h@xmath49 m@xmath5 ( k km s@xmath2 pc@xmath50 , where @xmath51h@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the density of h@xmath3 and brightness temperature for the co(1@xmath250 ) transition ( scoville & sanders 1987 ; solomon , downes , & radford 1992 ) .",
    "multitransition co surveys of molecular clouds in the milky way ( e.g. sanders et al .",
    "1993 ) , and in nearly starburst galaxies ( e.g. gsten et al .",
    "1993 ) have shown that hotter clouds tend of be denser such that the density and temperature dependencies tend to cancel each other .",
    "the variation in the value of @xmath54 is approximately a factor of 2 for a wide range of kinetic temperatures , gas densities , and co abundance ( e.g. @xmath55 [ k km s@xmath2 pc@xmath56^{-1}$ ] : radford , solomon , & downes 1991 ) we adopt a value of 4 @xmath57 ( k km s@xmath2 pc@xmath50 for @xmath54 , which is similar to the value determined for the bulk of the molecular gas in the disk of the milky way ( strong et al . 1988 ; scoville & sanders 1987 ) .",
    "@xmath58 ( k km s@xmath2)@xmath2 . ]",
    "thus , the molecular gas mass of 3c293 is @xmath59 m@xmath60 , ( @xmath615 times the molecular gas mass of the milky way ) , however , note that @xmath62 could be as low as @xmath63 m@xmath60 ( @xmath64 times the milky way molecular gas mass ) .",
    "in addition , the concentration of molecular gas within the inner 3 kpc of 3c 293 is @xmath61 530 m@xmath5 pc@xmath65 .",
    "such a molecular gas concentration is 4 - 400 times greater than that of nearby early - type spiral galaxies ( e.g. , young & scoville 1991 ) , but on the low end of h@xmath3 concentrations determined for a sample of @xmath66 l@xmath5 merging galaxies studied by scoville et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and bryant ( 1996 ) .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , several other radio galaxies have been detected in co by single - dish telescopes .",
    "millimeter interferometry of these radio galaxies is currently underway ; for the present moment , the global properties of 3c 293 will be briefly compared with these radio galaxies before discussing 3c 293 in detail .",
    "table 1 summarizes the infrared and co properties of 3c 293 relative to other co - luminous radio galaxies .",
    "the galaxy 3c 293 is one of the most molecular gas rich of the radio galaxies detected to date , but has a relatively low infrared luminosity and low @xmath67 ratio .",
    "the ratio @xmath68 is commonly referred to as the star formation `` efficiency '' ; if the infrared luminosity is dominated by reprocessed light from young , massive stars , then the ratio indicates how efficiently molecular gas is converted into stars . in the case of 3c 293",
    ", a ratio of 8.9 indicates that the galaxy is producing stars at the rate of quiescent spiral galaxies ( e.g. , sanders & mirabel 1996 ) .",
    "all of the more infrared luminous radio galaxies have very high @xmath68 ratios , but caution should be taken when interpreting their infrared luminosities ; in the most luminous infrared galaxies , there is strong evidence that the infrared luminosity is heavily contaminated by reprocessed agn light ( e.g. , evans et al .",
    "we will briefly return to this discussion in  4.6 .",
    "heckman et al . (",
    "1986 ) described 3c 293 as a primary galaxy connected to a southwestern companion galaxy by a bridge of emission which fans into a westward extending tidal tail beyond the companion .",
    "while the images in figure 1 do not have a wide enough field of view to show the tidal tail associated with the companion galaxy , figure 1b clearly shows the low surface brightness emission that appears to be connecting the two galaxies .",
    "indeed , the halo appears to completely envelope the primary galaxy .",
    "the high surface brightness morphology of the primary galaxy is clearly that of a disk galaxy ( figure 1a ) .",
    "the bulge component has redder colors than the disk component , and contains a prominent , warped dust lane ( see also van breugel et al . 1984 ) .",
    "the disk component also appears to be warped , but its apparent morphology may simply be an artifact of dust obscuration .",
    "it is not well understood what causes galaxy warps , but in the case of 3c 293 , the warp may result from gravitational interactions with the companion galaxy , gas infall , and/or a misalignment between the disk and halo ( e.g. binney 1992 ) .",
    "the co distribution of 3c 293 appears to be asymmetric ( figure 3 ) , and may be subject to the same warping observed in the dust lanes and possibly the large - scale disk . as is clear from the four extracted spectra and co morphology , the molecular gas is distributed in a disk rotating around the unresolved continuum source . taking a disk radius of 3.5@xmath11",
    "( 2.8 kpc ) and a velocity width at half the maximum intensity of @xmath69 km s@xmath2 , the dynamical mass is    @xmath70 , \\eqno(4)\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the gravitational constant , @xmath72 is the disk inclination , and @xmath73 is approximately unity ( e.g. bryant & scoville 1996 ) .",
    "thus the molecular gas mass is @xmath61 10% or less of the estimated dynamical mass .",
    "the remainder of the mass within this radius consists of stars and the central engine .",
    "a molecular gas warp has been inferred in the radio galaxy centaurus a by quillen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . from models of their single - dish telescope maps ,",
    "quillen et al . have speculated that the gas is in a triaxial potential .",
    "if the molecular gas in 3c 293 is also in such a potential , equation 4 may overestimate the true dynamical mass ( i.e. , if the gas is in elliptical orbits instead of circular ) .",
    "thus the molecular gas in the inner 2.8 kpc may constitute more than 10% of the total estimated gas mass .      what is the source of the 2.7 mm continuum emission ?",
    "the continuum emission , which has a flux density of 0.19 jy , fits the extrapolated @xmath74 power - law relation of the higher frequency radio flux densities , indicating that the 2.7 mm continuum emission is nonthermal .    as a doublecheck ,",
    "assume that the 2.7 mm emission is due to thermal emission from dust , such as is the case for arp 220 .",
    "arp 220 , which is at a distance of 77 mpc , has a 2.7 mm flux density of 0.035 jy ( scoville , yun , & bryant 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the 2.7 mm luminosity of 3c 293 is 30 times higher than that of arp 220 .",
    "if the assumption is made , as for arp 220 , that the emission at @xmath75 m is emanating from optically thin ( @xmath76 ) dust radiating at a temperature of @xmath77k , the dust mass is given by , @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the observed flux density , @xmath80 is the rest - frequency mass absorption coefficient with a value of 0.085 g@xmath2 @xmath81 ( i.e. , 10 g@xmath2 @xmath81 at 250 @xmath0 m scaled to 2.7 mm : hildebrand 1983 ) , @xmath82 is the rest - frequency value of the planck function",
    ". the derived dust mass of 3c 293 is thus @xmath83 m@xmath60 .",
    "further , if the dust in 3c 293 is radiating at a temperature of 15k , the derived dust mass is a factor of 3 higher .",
    "given that the standard gas - to - dust ratio is 100200 , and that the 2.7 mm continuum emission is not spatially extended like the co emission , the 2.7 mm continuum emission is unlikely to be thermal emission emanating from dust associated with the molecular gas .",
    "thus , the continuum emission most likely emanates from processes directly associated with a supermassive nuclear black hole or circumnuclear accretion disk .",
    "hi absorption features in several low - redshift radio galaxies have been extensively studied ( e.g. baan & haschick 1981 ; mirabel 1989 ; conway & blanco 1995 ) .",
    "such studies have attempted to determine the location and mass of hi within the host galaxies . in 3c 293 ,",
    "the depth of the co absorption is shallower in the single - dish spectrum than in the ovro spectrum , indicating that beam dilution is masking the true absorption depth . given this , the optical depth , @xmath84 , of 3c 293 is , @xmath85 ln@xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the continuum emission flux density and @xmath88 is the co absorption depth .    while the velocity dispersions of individual absorbing clouds are probably typical of giant molecular clouds ( i.e. , @xmath89 km s@xmath2 ) , the dispersion of the absorption feature ( @xmath90 60 km s@xmath2 ) may be due to the motion of the clouds around the nucleus of the galaxy . assuming this is the case , the absorption occurs in clouds at a distance of @xmath91 pc from the continuum source , where @xmath92 is the stellar / gaseous / black hole mass interior to the absorbing clouds and g is the gravitational constant .",
    "this is comparable to the metric size of the dust torus surrounding the nucleus of the nearby frii radio galaxy 3c270 ( ngc 4261 ) , detected using the hst ( jaffe et al .",
    "1996 ) .    is the velocity dispersion of the absorbing clouds really due to circumnuclear clouds in circular orbits ?",
    "similar stellar dispersion velocities have been observed in several galaxies believed to contain quiescent black holes ( i.e. , galaxies that may have once been radio galaxies or quasars ) : in the dwarf spheroidal m32 , which is believed to possess a @xmath93 m@xmath60 black hole , the velocity dispersion is 60 km s@xmath2 and increases to @xmath94 km s@xmath2 within the central 1@xmath11 ( 4 pc : e.g. , kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "the elliptical galaxy ngc 3377 , believed to harbor a @xmath95 m@xmath60 black hole , has a velocity dispersion of 90 km s@xmath2 which increases to @xmath96 km s@xmath2 within the central 1@xmath11 ( 48 pc : kormendy et al .",
    "however , if the dynamical mass within the inner 2.8 kpc of 3c 293 is on the order of @xmath97 m@xmath60 , 3c 293 as a whole may have a mass comparable to a massive elliptical galaxy ( @xmath98 m@xmath60 ) . within 100 pc of the nucleus , the dispersion may actually be @xmath99 km s@xmath2 , similar to those observed for ngc 3115 and ngc 4594 ( the sombrero galaxy : e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 ) .",
    "the co absorption may then be occuring in clouds in noncircular motion well outside of the circumnuclear region , such as is believed to be the case for some of the clouds responsible for the molecular absorption observed in centaurus a ( wiklind & combes 1997 ) .      in figure 4 , the large - scale radio emission of 3c 293 ( leahy , pooley , & riley 1986 ) is superimposed on the wide - field k@xmath12-band image .",
    "the large jets appear to be oriented nearly perpendicular to the major axis of the primary galaxy .",
    "based on the major axis of the co distribution ( figure 3 ) and the large scale structure , one might naively assume that the radio jets have simply escaped along the path of least resistance , the path perpendicular to the molecular gas and stellar distribution .",
    "such a scenario would be consistent with the idea that the central engine is fed by a molecular torus / accretion disk and that the radio jets escape along the axis perpendicular to the accretion disk ( e.g. blandford 1984 ) .",
    "the structure in the inner few arcseconds , however , complicates matters : figure 4a shows a high - resolution 5 ghz merlin map ( akujor et al .",
    "1996 ) superimposed on both the high - resolution co map and an archival hst 7000 @xmath13 of 3c 293 .",
    "the radio map has been registered with the co map by assuming that the core of the 5 ghz emission is coincident with the 2.7 mm continuum emission ( the coordinates of the 5 ghz core and the 2.7 mm continuum emission differ by @xmath100 , which is much less than the resolution of the ovro data ) .",
    "the registration of the merlin map with the hst image was done by first aligning the radio knots with features observed in a recently obtained near - infrared image of 3c 293 taken with the near - infrared camera and multiobject spectrometer ( nicmos ) aboard hst ( evans et al .",
    "such an alignment places the core of the 5 ghz emission on what appears to be the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "note that the nuclear dust lane observed in figure 1 breaks up into multiple dust lanes in the hst image , making the nuclear region of 3c 293 resemble that of centaurus a , which is dissected by a prominent warped dust lane ( sandage 1961 ) .",
    "the axis of the inner radio emission that extends 2.5@xmath11 ( 2.0 kpc ) from the nucleus is rotated @xmath101 relative to the outer 1.5 ghz radio emission , which itself spans 200@xmath11 ( 160 kpc ) from the tip of the bright nw lobe to the tip of the fainter se lobe .",
    "indeed , the twist of the eastern jet is apparent in the large - scale emission , which curves from the core towards the southern lobe .",
    "such a jet morphology can be caused by _",
    "i ) _ the redirection of the jets from a glancing impact with a molecular cloud or from a sudden change in the density gradient ( e.g. van breugel et al . 1984 ) , _ ii ) _ by a merger event or interaction , causing a warp in the galaxy and thus shifting the radio axis ( as in iras p09104 + 4109 : hines et al .",
    "1998 ) , or _",
    "iii ) _ by a precessing radio jet .",
    "the first scenario is supported by the fact that the eastern jet appears to twist northward after passing the 7000@xmath13 off - nuclear knot , then southward after passing the centroid of the western co component . at larger radii",
    ", the galactic density gradient would drive the large - scale radio emission to be perpendicular to the molecular and stellar distribution of the galaxy .",
    "however , it is difficult to reconcile this scenario with the relativistic velocity of the large - scale radio jets , as implied by the apparent doppler boosting ( dimming ) of the approaching nw ( receding se ) jets ; an impact with molecular clouds would undoubtedly cause the inner jet to lose substantial amounts of kinetic energy .",
    "the second scenario is supported by the morphologies of the primary and companion galaxies ( figure 1 ; heckman et al .",
    "1986 ) . given this",
    ", the inner radio jets may represent a more recent outburst triggered by a galaxy - galaxy interaction .",
    "following akujor et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , if it is assumed that the jet propagation speed is @xmath102 , the radio outburst resulting in the large scale structure occured @xmath103 years ago , and the companion outburst was produced only @xmath104 years ago .",
    "the third scenario is related somewhat to the second ; the creation of a radio jet in a dynamically unrelaxed environment could result in the observed precession , and thus the high - resolution merlin map reflects the present pole axis of the supermassive black hole .",
    "0.3 in      much of the interpretation of the dynamically state of 3c 293 is dependent on whether or not the companion galaxy is the trigger for the strong interaction / merger .",
    "there is indeed strong morphological evidence that the companion is associated with 3c 293 (  4.1 ) , but to our knowledge , there exists no published redshift of the companion .",
    "however , the companion appears to be a galaxy and not a foreground star ; the measured fwhm of the companion in the 2.17 @xmath105 image is 2.1@xmath11 , as compared with 1.2@xmath11 for stars in the field .    from the morphologies of 3c 293 and the companion",
    ", it might at first appear that the companion penetrated through the nuclear region of 3c 293 approximately ( 28 kpc / 250 km",
    "s@xmath106 @xmath107 years ago , leaving a trail of optical / near - infrared debris ( e.g. , figures 1 and 4 ) .",
    "alternatively , the bridge of optical / near - infrared emission between 3c 293 and the companion may be a nonaxisymmetric tidal feature viewed nearly edge - on , created as the orbit of the companion decays via dynamical friction ( see simulations by hernquist & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "however , a determination of the relative masses of the two galaxies suggests that the companion is not massive enough to have caused the morphological disturbances observed in 3c 293 ( figure 4a ) .",
    "the relative masses of the two galaxies can be estimated from the fact that the spectral energy distribution of supergiant stars peaks at @xmath611.6 @xmath0 m , and thus the observed 2.17 @xmath0 m luminosity is correlated with the mass of the galaxy .",
    "the ratio of companion mass to the mass of 3c 293 is therefore estimated to be @xmath108 .",
    "note that this ratio does not include light from the nucleus of 3c 293 , which may emanate from the active galactic nucleus .",
    "given that interactions with the companion are an unlikely trigger for the present state of 3c 293 , the linear feature extending from the host galaxy is most likely a tidal remnant from a merger event occuring more than 10@xmath109 years ago ( see simulations by barnes & hernquist 1992 , 1996 ) .",
    "similar one - sided tidal features are observed in advanced mergers such as mrk 273 ( e.g. mazzarella & boroson 1993 ) . a major difference between 3c 293 and advanced mergers such as mrk 273 ,",
    "arp 220 , and the radio galaxy 3c 120 is that 3c 293 has a relatively low @xmath110 ratio .",
    "this , however , may simply indicate that the star formation and/or agn activity in 3c 293 that is typically responsible for boosting the infrared luminosity is waning .",
    "the instabilities resulting from the merger have undoubtedly induced a loss of angular momentum in the molecular disk , causing a fraction of the gas to fall inward , ultimately serving as fuel for the nuclear activity .",
    "eventually , the stellar distribution will dynamically relax into that of an elliptical or an early - type spiral galaxy , possibly making 3c 293 resemble more classical fr ii radio galaxies such as cygnus a.",
    "in this paper , the first detection of co emission in an fr ii class radio galaxy , the galaxy 3c 293 , has been presented . the analysis of the co data has benefited from data taken at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "the following conclusions are drawn :    \\1 .",
    "the optical morphology of 3c 293 shows a primary and what appears to be a companion galaxy enveloped by a low surface brightness halo , consistent with previous optical images of the galaxy .",
    "in addition , the primary galaxy has a warped dust lane and a possible warped disk , most likely resulting from an interaction / merger , gas infall , and/or misalignment between the disk and halo of the primary galaxy .",
    "the co emission line is relatively broad ( @xmath111 km s@xmath2 ) , and contains a @xmath90 60 km s@xmath2 absorption feature at the same velocity as the hi absorption feature previously observed . using the standard co - to - h@xmath3 mass conversion factor ,",
    "the inferred molecular gas mass of 3c 293 is @xmath59 m@xmath60 .",
    "\\3 . the co emission in 3c 293",
    "is observed to be extended over a 7@xmath11 ( 5.7 kpc ) diameter region , and the h@xmath3 concentration within the inner 3 kpc is @xmath61 530 m@xmath60 pc@xmath65 .",
    "an unresolved , 2.7 mm continuum source is also detected , which is spatially coincident with the systemic absorption feature .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of the co emission are consistent with a disk of molecular gas rotating around the continuum source .",
    "the flux density of the 2.7 mm continuum source ( 0.19 jy ) is consistent with a power - law extrapolation of the radiowave flux densities .",
    "this , and the fact that the continuum emission is not coincident with the co emission , indicates that the 2.7 mm continuum emission is nonthermal in nature , and that it most likely emanates from a circumnuclear accretion disk around a supermassive black hole , and not from dust associated with the molecular gas .",
    "the radio jets of 3c 293 appear to twist by about 30@xmath112 from the inner 10@xmath11 to the radio lobes .",
    "the cause of the twist is either due to the effects of a varying interstellar density gradient , or precession , both of which are connected with a strong interaction or merger event in the recent history of 3c 293 .",
    "based on the above conclusions , the observed properties of 3c 293 result from a strong interaction or merger event .",
    "the resultant instabilities have most likely induced gas in the inner molecular disk to lose angular momentum and fall into the center of the gravitational potential well .",
    "such a scenario provides a plausible explanation of how the central engines of radio galaxies are fueled .",
