    "a presently popular way to understand the origin of matter - anti - matter asymmetry in the universe is to start with a mechanism to generate lepton asymmetry in the early universe using the cp violating effects in the decay of a heavy right handed majorana neutrinos@xcite and let the sphaleron interactions@xcite above the electroweak phase transtion temperature convert them to a baryon asymmetry .",
    "this is possible since the sphaleron interactions which violate b+l symmetry are in thermal equilibrium@xcite above the eletcroweak phase transition temperature .",
    "the right handed neutrino decay is of course not the only way to generate the pre - electroweak lepton asymmetry .",
    "several other ways have been discovered for the purpose ( e.g. see references @xcite ) .",
    "we will however focus in this paper on the decay of heavy right handed neutrinos since they also provide a simple way to understand small neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism@xcite .",
    "in particular , the existing experimental information on neutrino oscillations via the seesaw mechanism effects the nature of the right handed neutrino mass pattern .",
    "which in turn effects the magnitude of the baryon asymmetry .",
    "it is quite interesting that detailed analyses that use the exisitng neutrino data do indeed give the right magnitude for baryon asymmetry as well as important insight into the pattern of right handed neutrino masses@xcite .",
    "as noted in the original pioneering work of sakharov , cp violation is an essential ingredient in the generation of any particle - anti - particle asymmetry . in the present case ,",
    "the cp violating decays of the right handed neutrinos arise from the phases in right handed neutrino couplings and we will call them leptogenesis phases . it is clearly important to seek low energy manifestations of the leptogenesis phase for several reasons : first , this will improve our understanding of the right handed neutrino mass matrix which plays a crucial role in the neutrino mass physics at low energies ; secondly , it may shed light on the origin of the seesaw mechanism , which will then provide a useful window into physics beyond the standard model . moreover , since the seesaw formula provides some connection between the low and high scale phases in the theory , understanding leptogenesis phases may be a guide to the cp violating effects in neutrino oscillations , with its many experimental ramifications .    there have been a great deal of discussion of this issue in literature @xcite",
    ". specific models where the neutrino mass phase and leptogenesis phases are directly related have also been discussed in several papers@xcite providing one way to probe the latter .",
    "however in all previous discussions of this issue , the masses of the right handed neutrinos @xmath0 are either put in by hand or are assumed to arise from nonrenormalizable operators .",
    "it is however well known that in models that contain higgs bosons @xmath1 with b - l=2 , @xmath0 arises from a renormalizable coupling @xmath2 .",
    "examples of such theories are left - right symmetric models with triplet higgs fields or so(10 ) models with * 126 * dimensional higgs fields , @xmath3 models with higgs fields in @xmath4 representation . in such theories , there are new renormalization group running effects between the gut ( or planck ) scale and the seesaw scale .",
    "we showed in a previous paper@xcite that the presence of these renormalizable couplings can lead to quantitatively different effects in seesaw induced lepton flavor violation .",
    "in particular , the ratio @xmath5 depends on the susy breaking parameters in very different ways in different theories .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the electric dipole moments ( edm ) in the class of supersymmetric seesaw models with the @xmath6 coupling and discuss how it helps in probing the leptogenesis phase .",
    "since we are working within supersymmetric seesaw models , ( i ) we need to make assumptions about the nature of supersymmetry breaking and ( ii ) the embedding of mssm into new physics at the seesaw scale .    as for the first point , in common with many discussions in the literature",
    ", we will assume that the tev scale theory is the minimal supersymmetric standard model , which solves the gauge hierarchy problem plus the additional feature that the neutrinos have majorana masses arising from the seesaw mechanism .",
    "as far as susy breaking is concerned , we will work within the context of minimal msugra models@xcite and assume that around the gut or the planck scale , all soft susy breaking scalar masses are universal as are the gaugino masses and the a - terms are proportional to the yukawa couplings .",
    "furthermore we will assume that there are no overall phase in the @xmath7 terms , which is guaranteed if for example , mssm is part of a left - right symmetric susy model near the gut scale@xcite .",
    "the resulting theory is a very economical one with only five parameters characterizing the complete susy breaking sector of mssm and is therefore quite predictive .",
    "more importantly , the restrictive nature of this assumption means that at low energies , we are only tracking the effect of the phases in the right handed neutrino couplings responsible for leptogenesis and no other phase unrelated to neutrino physics is present .",
    "once we give up these assumptions , new phases could come in and confuse the issue .    as far as the high theory theory is concerned , to implement our premise of having seesaw mechanism arise out of a b - l = 2 higgs field",
    ", we will consider the high scale theory to be @xmath8 based with a standard model singlet @xmath1 with b - l = 2 breaking the b - l gauge symmetry and also giving the seesaw mechanism .",
    "this model can arise as an effective theory from left - right or so(10 ) theories .",
    "this extended model leaves the low energy predictions of mssm uneffected .",
    "the weak scale values of the supersymmetry breaking parameters can then be derived by the renormalization group extrapolations using the standard techniques .",
    "since it is the dimension four terms in the lagrangian which are largely responsible for the running , how the right handed neutrino masses are generated in the lagrangian does make difference to low energy phenomenology .",
    "we discuss the impact of this extra running effect on the lepton dipole moment observable which depends on the leptogenesis phases .",
    "the main result of our investigation is that if the right handed neutrino mass in the seesaw mechanism arises from the vev of a b - l=2 higgs field , it has the effect of enhancing the lepton electric dipole moments over models where the right handed neutrino mass is put in by hand .",
    "we give two examples to illustrate this point : one where the neutrino mixings arise purely from dirac yukawa coupling of the right handed neutrinos and a second one where it arises from their majorana coupling @xmath6 .",
    "we also discuss the case of a @xmath9 seesaw models . in all the cases ,",
    "a b - l=2 higgs field is responsible for righthanded neutrino masses .",
    "we present the results of our calculation for electron amd muon edms for the above models making sure that we stay in the range of parameters which fit all neutrino data and generate the right amount of lepton asymmetry .",
    "we find that leptogenesis phase can lead to enhanced edms for leptons in the presence of the @xmath6 couplings than in their absence ( i.e. where the rh neutrino has a bare mass term . ) , although the effects are still small .",
    "most optimistic values for electron edms in our models are between @xmath10 to @xmath11 ecm and for muon edm between @xmath12 to @xmath13 ecm .",
    "it is encouraging that there are ideas and plans for drastic improvement in the search for the lepton edms in the future@xcite .",
    "for instance , search for electrons edm upto the level of @xmath11 ecm@xcite and muon edm to @xmath14 ecm have been contemplated@xcite .    although the values predicted by our analysis are small , high precision searches for lepton edms to the contemplated level can still teach us something useful . for instance , if the edms discovered are above our predictions , it will mean one of several things : either there is gross departures from the assumed forms for supersymmetry breaking terms or if independent experiments such as at lhc or tevatron have confirmed the susy breaking assumptions ( universality and proportionality ) , we would have to conclude that baryogenesis does not originate via leptogenesis .",
    "either of these conclusions would be very important in our search for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we have organized this paper as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , we present a generic model based on the gauge group @xmath8 to discuss the general calculational framework and the basic idea of our work ; in sec 3 , we discuss the renormalization group effects of the neutrino sector on the supersymmetry parameters . in sec.4 , we present a qualitative explanation of how the enhancement of edm can arise in our approach ; in sec . 5 , we briefly discuss the calculation of baryogenesis ; in sec . 6",
    "we discuss the first neutrino mass model , give the neutrino mass fits , calculation of lepton asymmetry and present the results for lepton edms ; in sec . 7 and 8",
    ", we repeat the same discussion for two other models ; in sec .",
    "9 , we summarize our results and present the conclusions .",
    "to proceed with our discussion , let us write the superpotential for our model , which must be invariant under the gauge group @xmath8 : @xmath15 here @xmath16 are leptonic superfields ; @xmath17 are the higgs fields .",
    "we do not display the quark part of the superpotential but it is same as in the mssm .    the first point to notice",
    "is that it is a very simple extension of the mssm superpotential , that leads to a vacuum with @xmath18 .",
    "this leads to the rh neutrino mass matrix @xmath19 and clearly it arises from a renormalizable term in the lagrangian .",
    "this superpotential has also another advantage that it solves the @xmath20 problem@xcite i.e. it predicts that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the superpartner mass , which is of order of a tev . to see this , notice that this potential has an r - symmetry under which @xmath23 ;",
    "( the fields transform as @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ; @xmath26 and all other fields remain unchanged under r - symmetry ) .",
    "the vanishing of the f - terms then imply that @xmath27 and @xmath28 arises from supersymmetry breaking terms . as a result @xmath29 .    the seesaw formula ( type i )",
    "can be written as : @xmath30 we can choose a basis where the coupling matrix @xmath6 is diagonal as is the charged lepton yukawa coupling matrix @xmath31 .",
    "the neutrino dirac coupling matrix @xmath32 is then a @xmath33 complex matrix whose diagonal elements can be made real by suitable redefinition of the phases of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 fields .",
    "this leaves us with nine real parameters in the @xmath32 matrix and six phases .",
    "we rewrite the @xmath32 matrix as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are ckm type matrices with only one phase in each .",
    "thus all six phases are accounted for .    to see which of the phases are responsible for lepton asymmetry ,",
    "let us write down the formula for lepton asymmetry , @xmath41@xcite : @xmath42 ^ 2_{1j } f(\\frac{m_1}{m_j } ) \\label{nl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where symbol 1 in the above equation denotes the lightest right handed neutrino eigenstate .",
    "note that using eq.[wv ] , one can conclude that only the phase in @xmath39 and those in @xmath43 contribute to lepton asymmetry .",
    "the phases in @xmath44 completely drop out .",
    "our goal will therefore be to see how we can measure the phases in @xmath43 and @xmath39 by low energy experiments .    secondly , we find two results for the three generation case that we state below .",
    "the first point is that the lepton asymmetry parameter @xmath41 is independent of the pmns mixing angles . to show this first note that @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the pmns mixing matrix .",
    "we can now invert the seesaw relation to conclude that @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a complex matrix with the property that @xmath50@xcite .",
    "the set of matrices @xmath49 in fact form a group analogous to the complex extension of the lorentz group . using eq.[ynu ] in eq.[nl ] , we see that lepton asymmetry @xmath41 is independent of the pmns mixing angles in @xmath47@xcite . this result is important because what this means is that if there are three right handed neutrinos , low energy experiments such as neutrino oscillations and neutrinoless double beta decay give us no information about the leptogenesis phase .",
    "to see this , we rewrite the formula for @xmath41 in a slightly different way . using the seesaw formula in eq.[seesaw ] and assuming that there is a mass hierarchy among the right handed neutrinos , we can write@xcite @xmath51_{11 } \\label{buch}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using this and eq.[ynu ]",
    ", we can write @xmath52 from this we can conclude that when the neutrino masses are degenerate i.e. @xmath53 , then @xmath54 since @xmath55 is real .",
    "this result , to the best of our knowledge does not exist in literature .",
    "a similar result for the manifestly cp violating observable @xmath56 was noticed in ref.@xcite , where it was pointed out that it vanishes for degenerate neutrinos .",
    "an implication of this result is that if neutrinoless double beta decay results imply @xmath57 ev(see e.g. @xcite ) , then the lepton asymmetry from rh neutrino decay will be suppressed by an extra factor of 100 and we might then have to look for extra enhancements or completely different way of obtaining the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "let us now proceed to the main part of our discussion , which involves the supersymmetry breaking superpartner proiperties at low energies .",
    "it is clear that one simple way to measure high scale parameters of a theory is to look for low energy observables that owe their origin or magnitude to the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) from the high scale to the low scale ( i.e. without rge effects , the low energy theory will predict the observable to be very tiny . ) in our case such observables are lepton flavor violating transitions as well as lepton electric dipole moments ( edms ) . in the absence of the rge effects",
    ", we expect @xmath58 to be proportional to @xmath59 as far as the edm of leptons go , in the low energy theory without any other effects i.e. standard model with a majorana mass for the neutrino , we would expect @xmath60 to be of order @xmath61 ecm .    in supersymmetric models ,",
    "the presence of superpartners introduce new contributions to both lfv as well as edm observables at the one loop level , where virtual superpartners flow inside the loop .",
    "the resulting lfv and edm effects are therefore not only enhanced but they are also sensitive to the nature of susy breaking terms . in this paper",
    "we will assume a very restrictive form for the susy breaking terms which defines the so called msugra models . according to this assumption , the scalar masses and all gaugino masses are universal at the gut or the planck scale ; the @xmath7 terms are proportional to the yukawa couplings .",
    "these assumptions are motivated in several susy breaking scenarios ; they not only reduce the number of parameters in the theory but may be necessary for understanding the observed suppression of flavor changing effects in both quark and lepton sectors .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that the overall phase in the @xmath7 term is zero .",
    "this can happen for example , if the theory is part of susy left - right model at the gut scale@xcite .",
    "this is necessary in order to resolve the so - called susy cp problem .",
    "the proportionality assumption coupled with the assumtion of no overall phase in the @xmath7 term guarantees that all the cp violating phases in the lepton sector sector are in the @xmath32 and therefore any cp violating low energy effect after renormalization group evolution is only sensitive to the phases that are manifested in the leptogenesis as well as the neutrino oscillations via the seesaw mechanism .    as mentioned , we need to extrapolate the susy breaking parameters from the gut or planck scale down to the seesaw scale where we will perform the calculation of the electric dipole moments of the electron and the muon",
    ". this extrapolation will always involve the couplings @xmath32 and the diagonal coupling matrix @xmath31 .",
    "extrapolation below the seesaw scale only involves the @xmath31 which is mostly diagonal to leading order and does not effect any of our results .",
    "we will keep only one loop effects .",
    "the relevant renormalization group equations are : @xmath62+\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}ff^{\\dagger}y_{\\nu}\\\\ \\frac{dm^2_l}{dt}~=~\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2 } [ ( m^2_l + 2m^2_{h_d } ) y^{\\dagger}_\\ell y_\\ell + ( m^2_l+2h^2_u)y^{\\dagger}_{\\nu}y_{\\nu } + 2y^{\\dagger}_\\ell m^2_{e^c}y_\\ell + y^{\\dagger}_\\ell y_\\ell m^2_l\\\\ \\nonumber+2y^{\\dagger}_\\nu m^2_{\\nu^c}y_\\nu + y^{\\dagger}_\\nu y_\\nu m^2_l   + 2a^{\\dagger}_\\ell a_\\ell + 2a^{\\dagger}_\\nu a_\\nu   -6g^2_2m_2 ^ 2 - 3g^2_{b - l}m_{b - l}^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us also write down the renormalization group equations for the @xmath7 parameters- specifically the @xmath63 .",

    "we do this in the following section .",
    "to see the new effects from the @xmath6 couplings in a qualitative manner , we note that the dominant supersymmetric contributions to the lepton dipole moments come from the one loop diagram involving the bino .",
    "a rough estimate of this is @xmath66 if there is an overall phase in @xmath67 , then one can easily estimate @xmath68 ecm . to be consistent with present limits i.e. @xmath69 ecm",
    ", one must have phase @xmath70 .",
    "this is the so called susy phase problem .",
    "we assume that in the theory the susy cp problem has been solved , ( e.g. by embedding the mssm into a susy lr model as mentioned ) so that we can set @xmath71 . in this limit , in the absence of the rge effects , since @xmath72 is real , in this limit , all edms vanish .",
    "if this term dominated the contribution to the lepton dipole moments , then since the @xmath7 term i d proportional to charged lepton masses , we would have the scaling law @xmath73 . in any theory where this law holds , the present upper limit on electron edm of @xmath74 ecm",
    "would imply that @xmath75 ecm .",
    "also this scaling law is a signature of the simplicity of the underlying theory . in the supersymmetric context ,",
    "there exist exceptions to this scaling law@xcite .",
    "after rge effects are taken into account , lepton edms receive contributions from @xmath76 which is not a diagonal matrix as well as @xmath77 and @xmath78 which are diagonal matrices at the gut scale .",
    "the @xmath72 and @xmath67 at the seesaw scale are polynomials in these matrices and in order to get a nonvanishing contribution to @xmath79 , we must look for imaqginary diagonal elements in the product @xmath80 , which will involve products of @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .    the leading order term in @xmath80 in the absence of the @xmath6 couplings ( i.e. a bare mass term for @xmath81 ) , which has a complex @xmath82 entry is of the form @xmath83 . \\label{simple}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( 3 ) , it is easy to see that @xmath76 is independent of the matrix @xmath84 that is responsible for leptogenesis .",
    "one might conclude from this that simple rge extrapolations like this term will never enable us to probe the matrix @xmath84 .",
    "however , as has been argued in@xcite , since @xmath76 is sensitive to the unitary matrix @xmath40 in eq .",
    "so in principle , one can get @xmath40 from the experimental information about supersymmetry breaking sector . then",
    ", if one is given the right handed neutrino mass spectrum and the form of @xmath32 , one can get all the matrix elements of @xmath84 using the relation @xmath85 and hence the baryogenesis phases .",
    "this would require knowledge of all the matrix elements of slepton mass matrix . while this is possible in principle",
    ", one would like a more `` experimentally feasible '' way to probe the phases in @xmath84 .",
    "this is what we pursue here .",
    "there are two ways in which the rge extrapolation can still leave traces of the matrix @xmath84 .",
    "one way discussed in @xcite is the following . in the case",
    "where the right handed neutrino masses are hierarchical , the simple rge expression in the above paragraph gets modified by threshold effects as follows : the simple expression in eq.[simple ] remains valid above the highest right handed neutrino mass , @xmath86 ; once we go below this i.e. for @xmath87 , only the second and the lightest rh neutrinos contribute .",
    "this means that in the matrix @xmath32 , only @xmath88 and @xmath89 contribute and below @xmath90 only @xmath89 entries contribute .",
    "therefore traces of the matrix @xmath84 remain in the low energy expressions . to get a large effect , a significant gap between the @xmath86 and @xmath91 is required .    another way that @xmath84 can be visible is the presence of the @xmath6 terms , which give the leading contribution to edm to be @xmath92 instead of what is given in [ simple ] .",
    "thus in this case , there is a higher order effect even in the absence of threshold effects .",
    "note further that each time a term of the form @xmath76 or @xmath77 appears , there is a loop suppression factor @xmath93 . taking this into account",
    "we see that the second contribution ( i.e. one in the presence of the @xmath6 couplings ) is enhance by the inverse of one loop factor compared to the first one .",
    "also , there is an additional effect coming from the gap between the @xmath94 or @xmath95 and @xmath86 . therefore barring unexpected cancellations",
    ", we expect the edm contribution in the presence of @xmath6 contributions to be bigger . in our numerical integrations to present the final numbers for edms , we keep the threshold effects .",
    "as already mentioned earlier , we use the msugra framework to calculate the electric dipole moments of the muon and the electron . the value of the universal scalar mass @xmath96 , universal gaugino mass @xmath97 , universal trilinear term @xmath98 , @xmath99 and the sign of @xmath100 as free parameters determine our final result .",
    "we also assume that there is no phase associated with the susy breaking .",
    "the yukawa and/or the majorana couplings are responsible for cp violation in these models .",
    "the msugra parameter space is constrained by the experimental lower limit on @xmath101 and the measurements of @xmath102 and the recent results on dark matter relic density@xcite . for low @xmath99 , the parameter space has lower bound on @xmath97 from the light higgs mass bound of @xmath103 gev . for larger @xmath99 the lower bound on @xmath97",
    "is produced by the cleo constraint on the br(@xmath102 ) .",
    "the recent wmap results have led to stronger constraints on dark matter density which in turn reduces the allowed parameter space of msugra mostly to the co - annihilation region for @xmath104 gev .",
    "we calculate the baryon to photon ratio @xmath105 in three different models for neutrino masses . the susy breaking parameters do not play a role in this discussion .",

    ", one can choose a basis such that @xmath31 and @xmath6 are diagonal .",
    "the most general @xmath9 matrix @xmath32 can now be parameterized as : @xmath159 where @xmath160 and @xmath161 where @xmath162 .    in order to calculate the edms and @xmath105",
    ", we will work with the horizontal model of ref.@xcite , which leads to a specific realization of the @xmath9 seesaw formula .",
    "the model is based on the gauge group @xmath163 with fermion assignments given as follows :    * table i *    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table caption : * we display the quantum number of the matter and higgs superfields of our model .    here",
    "@xmath164 denote the left handed lepton doublet superfields .",
    "other symbols are self explanatory .",
    "we arrange the higgs potential in such a way that the @xmath165 symmetry is broken by @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where @xmath168 .",
    "the vevs for @xmath169 are chosen so as to cancel the d - terms and leave supersymmetry unbroken below the scale of horizontal symmetry breaking .",
    "the yukawa superpotential for this model is given by : @xmath170 the parameters in the above equation have been determined to fit neutrino mass data at low energies@xcite .",
    "we use them in our calculation .",
    "we expect the predictions to be typical of most @xmath9 models . from @xcite",
    ", we see that at @xmath121 , the charged lepton mass matrix is given by ( at the scale @xmath171 gev ) : @xmath172 this determines all the yukawa couplings responsible for charged lepton masses to be @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 with @xmath177 and @xmath178 .",
    "we get the correct values of charged lepton masses at the weak scale from the above matrix .",
    "we use the mssm rges between the horizontal scale and the weak scale .",
    "the @xmath6 is given at the horizontal scale : @xmath179 using the same @xmath109s as above , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , we find @xmath182 , @xmath183 ev@xmath128 , @xmath150 , @xmath184 ev@xmath128 and @xmath185 which are within the experimentally allowed regions .",
    "we find @xmath152 .",
    "in fig.5 we plot the electric dipole moments of electron and the muon as functions of @xmath97 and @xmath96 for @xmath121 and @xmath158 gev .",
    "we again satisfy the relic dark matter density constraint .",
    "we find that unlike other models , both @xmath153 and @xmath186 are of same order and as large as @xmath11 ecm .",
    "= 8.0 cm    to be completely phenomenologically consistent , we need to study the profile of lepton flavor violation for all these models . for model 1 ,",
    "this has been studied extensively in @xcite and the results are within the present bounds but quite testable as has been emphasized .",
    "similarly , the branching ratio for @xmath187 in model 3 can be found in ref.@xcite . we will therefore only calculate br[@xmath187 ] for model 2 for our choice of parameters and present them in fig.6 for different values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we again demand the relic density constraint to be satisfied in this parameter space .",
    "we find that the most region of the parameter space is allowed by this branching ratio .",
    "the br for @xmath189 is @xmath190 in the same region parameter space .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the electric dipole moment of the electron and the muon in supersymmetric seesaw models where right handed neutrino masses arise from renormalizable coupling in the superpotential . using this",
    "we have attempted to probe the cp violating phases in the right handed neutrino mass matrix responsible for leptogenesis .",
    "we consider the minimal gauge group which allows for this .",
    "we make the simple and widely used choice for the supersymmetry breaking parameters as in the msugra models so that no new phases enter the discussion , other than the phases in the rh neutrino mass matrix which manifest at low energies and in leptogenesis .",
    "we find that due to the fact that the right handed neutrino masses arise via renormalizable couplings , the lepton edms get enhanced and in some models come within the range accessible to proposed experiments . for instance , we can have @xmath186 as large as @xmath11 ecm .",
    "the largest values for muon edm we predict are at the level of @xmath191 ecm .",
    "also , the scaling law @xmath192 does not hold in general .",
    "all the parameters of our model are chosen so that they are consistent with present neutrino data and the produce the required baryon asymmetry .",
    "the smallness of the edm values in most cases is due to the assumptions of complete universality of scalar masses in the mssm and the proportionality of the @xmath7 terms to the yukawa coupling . to the extent that collider experiments have the potential to confirm or rule out the msugra models in the near future",
    ", these results can teach us important things about the origin of matter as well as about the origin of neutrino masses .",
    "clearly if the assumtions about susy breaking terms is relaxed , one can enhance the edm values further .",
    "one must then make sure that new phases not connected to leptogenesis are not responsible for the enhancement . in the minimal model",
