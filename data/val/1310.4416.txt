    "in the last years , the possibility that parity breaks in qcd at high temperatures and/or densities has received a lot of attention @xcite . although parity is well known to be a symmetry of strong interactions , there are reasons to believe that it may be broken in extreme conditions .",
    "on the one hand , theoretical work using effective meson lagrangians satisfying the qcd symmetries at low energies suggest that for some values of the vector chemical potential @xmath0 a new phase with an isotriplet pseudoscalar condensate may arise @xcite . on the other hand , thermal fluctuations in a finite volume",
    "may lead to large topological fluctuations that induce a non - trivial axial quark charge that could be described in a quasi - equilibrium situation by an axial chemical potential @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "checking these claims in qcd is unfortunately very difficult .",
    "for one thing , finite density numerical simulations in the lattice present serious difficulties @xcite . a vector chemical potential in gauge theories like qcd can not be easily treated and therefore simpler models hopefully reproducing the main features of the theory may be useful .",
    "needless to say , non - equilibrium effects are also notoriously difficult to study non - perturbatively . however , an axial chemical potential is tractable on the lattice @xcite and with other methods @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we shall consider the nambu  jona - lasinio model ( njl ) @xcite , which shares interesting features with qcd such as the appearance of chiral symmetry breaking . in the njl modelization ,",
    "qcd gluon interactions among fermions are assumed to be replaced by some effective four - fermion couplings .",
    "confinement is absent in the njl model , but global symmetries can be arranged to be identical in both theories .",
    "however , njl is definitely not qcd and the present work does not attempt to draw definite conclusions on the latter theory ; just to point out possible phases requiring further analysis .",
    "previously some authors have studied the effect of a vector chemical potential @xmath0 with three flavours @xcite in the njl model , but the consequences of including both a vector and an axial chemical potentials have not been considered so far to our knowledge . in this work , we will incorporate both chemical potentials with the purpose of unravelling the landscape of different stable phases of the theory .",
    "it turns out that the inclusion of @xmath1 changes radically the phase structure of the model and shows that @xmath0 is not a key player in ushering a thermodynamically stable phase where parity is violated in the njl model , but @xmath1 is .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the njl lagrangian with the incorporation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be introduced .",
    "we describe how an effective potential is extracted when one introduces some effective light meson states and integrates out the fermion degrees of freedom . in sec .",
    "3 we show the gap equations of the model and the conditions for their stability .",
    "after that , the different stable phases of this model are presented and discussed .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "4 that a phase with an isospin singlet pseudoscalar condensate in addition to a scalar condensate is possible .",
    "it turns out that the conditions for this phase to be stable and exhibit chiral symmetry breaking too are such that one gets an inverted mass spectrum with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is quite different from qcd . in sec .",
    "4 we also present the main results of this work with plots of the evolution of the scalar and pseudoscalar condensates together with the main features of the phase transition .",
    "finally , sec . 5 is devoted to summarize our conclusions .",
    "the starting point of this work is the njl lagrangian where we incorporate a vector and an axial chemical potentials @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . for two flavours and @xmath4 colours",
    ", we have @xmath5 -\\frac{g_2}n[(\\bar\\psi\\vec\\tau\\psi)^2+(\\bar\\psi i\\gamma_5\\psi)^2],\\ ] ] with a full @xmath6 chiral invariance in the case that @xmath7 , while if these constants differ , the @xmath8 symmetry breaks and only @xmath9 remains .",
    "one may introduce two doublets of bosonic degrees of freedom @xmath10 and @xmath11 by adding the following chiral invariant term @xmath12 these would be identified with their namesake qcd states ( actually @xmath13 and @xmath14 for the last two ) .",
    "euclidean conventions will be used throughout .",
    "we bosonize the model following the same procedure as in @xcite .    after shifting each bosonic field with the quark bilinear operator that carries the corresponding quantum numbers ,",
    "the lagrangian may be rewritten as @xmath15\\psi + \\frac{ng_1 ^ 2}{4g_1}(\\sigma^2+\\vec \\pi^2)+\\frac{ng_2 ^ 2}{4g_2}(\\eta^2+\\vec a^2),\\ ] ] which shows a redundancy related to the coupling constants @xmath16 that appear attached to each doublet and it is eventually related to their wave function normalization . without further ado",
    "we will take @xmath17 .",
    "integration of the fermions will produce a bosonic effective potential ( or free energy ) and will allow to study the different phases of the model .",
    "we will work in the mean field approximation and accordingly neglect fluctuations .",
    "the results will be exact in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "@xmath18 where the trace is understood to be performed in the isospin and dirac spaces in addition to a 4-momentum integration of the operator in the momentum space . throughout this article",
    "we will assume that @xmath19 , namely we consider a baryon ( as opposed to antibaryon ) finite density .",
    "the invariance under @xmath20 of the action ensures that the free energy ( [ v ] ) only depends on the modulus of @xmath0 .",
    "we also define the fermion operator @xmath21 with the introduction of a constituent quark mass @xmath22 .    in appendix",
    "[ trick ] we show that the dependence on both vector and axial chemical potentials does not change the reality of the fermion determinant .",
    "however , its sign remains undetermined , and in order to ensure a positive determinant , we shall consider an even number of `` colours '' @xmath4 so that one can safely assume @xmath23=\\sqrt{\\det[\\mathcal m(\\mu,\\mu_5)]^2}\\ ] ] and hence , use the calculations in appendix [ trick ] .",
    "if we just retain the neutral components of the triplets , this determinant can be written in the following way @xmath24 + \\log\\left [ -(ik_0 + \\mu)^2+(|\\vec k|\\pm \\mu_5)^2+m_-^2\\right ] \\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25.\\ ] ] from now on , when we refer to the neutral pion condensate , we will write @xmath26 .",
    "note that , as explained in appendix [ trick ] , one is able to write the determinant as the trace of an operator that is the identity in flavour space in spite of the initial non - trivial flavour structure .",
    "this facilitates enormously the calculations .    in the search for stable configurations in the potential",
    "we will need the derivatives of the fermion determinant , which are basically given by the function @xmath27 that we define as @xmath28},\\ ] ] which is clearly divergent in the uv . in this work",
    ", we will deal with the njl model using dimensional regularization ( dr ) and a 3-momentum cut - off ( @xmath29 ) both at zero temperature @xcite .",

    "the two results are then identical if we identify @xmath33 however in both cases the logarithmic divergence can not be absorbed @xcite unless we include extra terms in the lagrangian like @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "this is of course a manifestation of the non - renormalizability of the model .",
    "for this reason , we shall assume the scale @xmath29 ( or equivalently @xmath36 ) to represent a physical cut - off and write @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that @xmath27 increases with @xmath0 and decreases with @xmath1 .",
    "the derivative of this function will also be used @xmath38.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it verifies the property @xmath39 .",
    "we will now explore the different phases that are allowed by the effective potential by solving the gap equations and analysing the second derivatives to investigate the stable configurations of the different scalar and pseudoscalar condensates .",
    "the gap equations for the system read @xmath40 where @xmath41 ( the same convention applies to @xmath42 ) .",

    "[ japos3].,title=\"fig : \" ]    in the upper panels , we set @xmath130 mev ( left ) and @xmath88 mev ( right ) , both of them @xmath132 , where jumps in @xmath85 are observed in the parity even phase together with tiny metastable regions .",
    "this behaviour is very similar to the one described in fig .",
    "[ japos3 ] with the subtlety that we inverted the sign of @xmath133 and therefore , the parity - odd phase may be reached .",
    "in addition , this change of sign shifts the second derivative @xmath92 , which is the only responsible for the apparent big jump in the @xmath88 mev window ( the one with lower @xmath1 ) . it should be clear that @xmath73 since @xmath85 is growing with @xmath1 .",
    "however , the second derivative @xmath92 becomes negative due to this shift while all the other derivatives remain positive .",
    "if for a moment we forgot @xmath92 , the curve would be smoothly increasing and we would only have the other tiny jump close to the flat region of constant @xmath85 .",
    "however , the fact that this second derivative becomes negative leads to a small range of @xmath1 where no solution exists . hence , it seems natural to think that the system goes away from the phase with @xmath44 and acquires a non - trivial scalar isotriplet condensate .",
    "we emphasize this region is really tiny and depends crucially on the specific values for the parameters , even disappearing for @xmath134 .",
    "both graphics show a smooth transition to the parity - odd phase , say , via a 2nd order phase transition with the same characteristics of the previous section with @xmath55 .",

    "[ mu5-mu ] . for @xmath139 mev ( or equivalently , for @xmath140 ) , the transition is smooth ( 2nd order ) while beyond that there is a jump in the condensates ( 1st order ) , as it was also observed in the previous figure .",

    "the nambu  jona - lasinio model has traditionally received much attention as a toy model for qcd . in spite of the obvious shortcomings of this analogy ,",
    "njl is regarded as providing an intuitive picture of the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking in qcd via a strong effective interaction in the scalar isosinglet channel .",
    "more recently the njl model has received attention as a simpler arena where other aspects of qcd could be tested , such as extreme qcd .",
    "although it is far from obvious that njl is a good modellisation of qcd then , these tests are still useful to understand in a simpler theory what are the right questions to pose .    in this context",
    ", the njl model has been used recently by some authors @xcite to investigate the nature of the aoki phase in qcd @xcite .",
    "this is a phase in lattice qcd with wilson fermions where parity and possibly isospin symmetry is broken .",
    "it does not survive the continuum ( note that the njl does not have a ` continuum limit ' either ) .",
    "it is however conceivable that the introduction of the chemical potential may enlarge the scope of the aoki phase and allow for a sensible continuum interpretation .",
    "this is what should happen if the effective theory analysis of some of the present authors described in @xcite is correct .",
    "finite chemical potential simulations being notoriously difficult in lattice",
    "qcd , it is worth to analyse simpler theories such as njl where analytical methods are available in the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "the generation of an axial charge in heavy ion collision processes has also been contemplated in the theory .",
    "the effects on qcd phenomenology of such a charge have been barely considered in the past .",
    "njl may provide a first guidance to the problem too .    in this paper we work in the continuum and",
    "explore in detail the different phases that arise in the nambu  jona - lasinio model in the presence of both vector and axial chemical potentials at zero temperature .",
    "the incorporation of @xmath1 together with @xmath0 had not been investigated before .",
    "the axial chemical potential changes considerably the thermodynamical properties of the model .",
    "it leads to a non - trivial dependence of the scalar condensate in the chirally broken phase .",
    "interestingly , when the full @xmath6 global symmetry is broken to @xmath141 ( i.e. @xmath142 ) a phase where parity is spontaneously broken by the presence of an isosinglet condensate @xmath95 appears .",
    "however , we have not found any phase where parity and flavour symmetry are simultaneously broken thus indicating the presence of a non - zero value for @xmath143 . on the contrary",
    "we have found an extremely small region in the @xmath144 space of parameters where flavour symmetry is broken by a non - zero value of @xmath145 but parity is not broken yet .",
    "however , the appearence of a parity breaking condensate in the isosinglet sector is rather generic for @xmath97 .",
    "demanding stability of such a phase however leads to a region of parameter space where the spectrum has little resemblance to the one of qcd .",
    "we have investigated all the properties of the transition from the parity - even to the parity - odd phase providing results on the evolution of both condensates , which exhibit finite jumps under certain conditions , and finally examining the phase transition line , where it was shown that for @xmath146 we have a 2nd order transition while for @xmath137 , it corresponds to a 1st order one .",
    "the discussion presented here on the phase structure of the njl model in the presence of external chemical potentials is rather general and , as discussed above , the model -in spite of its simplicity- exhibits an enormously rich phase structure .",
    "this hopefully indicates that qcd still holds many surprises for us too .",
    "we would like to thank v. azcoiti and e. follana for numerous discussions concerning parity breaking in the njl model and , particularly , for clarifying to us several points on the reality and positivity properties of the fermion determinant .",
