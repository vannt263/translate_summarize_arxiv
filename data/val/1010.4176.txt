    "progress of observational astronomy depends mostly on advances in the wavelength coverage , sensitivity , and angular resolution .",
    "although the record in resolution is set by long - baseline interferometers , imaging and spectroscopy of faint sources is done today at the angular resolution of adaptive optics ( ao ) in the infra - red ( ir ) and at the resolution of the 2.4-m hubble space telescope in the visible .",
    "reaching the diffraction limit in the visible from the ground for progressively fainter sources continues to be an important goal for astronomy .",
    "here we report on new experiments in this direction .",
    "diffraction - limited resolution at large ground - based telescopes has been first attained by speckle interferometry @xcite . in the following years , modifications to this method to obtain true images , rather than their auto - correlations ( acfs ) , have been developed .",
    "one of the early approaches consisted in shifting the images to concidence of their brightest pixels and accumulating the result .",
    "this _ shift - and - add _ ( saa ) method @xcite has been used to reconstruct the first image of stellar surface @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated that this approach is superior to simple tip - tilt compensation @xcite .",
    "tip - tilt correction works well only at moderate @xmath1 ratios ( @xmath2  telescope diameter , @xmath3  fried parameter ) ; in this case , selection of the sharpest images with prominent central speckle is a good strategy . for @xmath4 , the probablity of obtaining diffraction - limited image without turbulence correction becomes negligible , but the saa method and speckle interferometry still work .",
    "the development of electron - multiplication ccd ( emccd ) detectors made it practical to record sequencies of short - exposure frames without readout noise penalty . on this occasion",
    ", the saa method was revived under a new name , _ lucky imaging _",
    "a combination of re - centering on bright pixel and selection of best frames was proposed .",
    "the selection works well only at small @xmath1 , restricting this approach to long wavelengths and to telescopes with @xmath5 m",
    ". however , partial turbulence correction with ao effectively increases @xmath3 , and the saa method can give good results at larger apertures @xcite .",
    "dedicated high - resolution imagers such as luckycam @xcite or fastcam @xcite were built to take advantage of these new opportunities .",
    "an ao system for partial image correction in the vsible , soar adaptive module ( sam ) , is being built at ctio @xcite for the southern astrophysical research telescope ( soar ) .",
    "this instrument will use a rayleigh laser guide star to selectively correct low turbulence layers .",
    "the diffraction limit will not be reached , but the effective increase of @xmath3 resulting from the partial correction will boost the potential of other methods such as speckle interferometry and saa .",
    "first tests of these methods at soar are described by @xcite and @xcite , respectively .    in this paper",
    "we report some results from the first tests of sam . at this stage ,",
    "natural guide stars ( ngs ) were used to close the ao loop .",
    "we begin with the description of our experiments in section  [ sec : exp ] and the analysis of the ao performance in section  [ sec : loop ] . then",
    "three methods of data processing  simple averaging , saa , and speckle interferometry  are compared in section  [ sec : img ] .",
    "measurements of close binary stars obtained as a by - product of these tests are reported in section  [ sec : res ] ; they continue the series of speckle observations published by @xcite ( hereafter tmh10 ) .",
    "some pairs deserve special comments ; two faint tertiary companions in wider binaries were resolved for the first time .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] with a perspective of diffraction - limited imaging in the visible .",
    "soar is located at the cerro pachn observatory in chile , at 2800 m above the sea level .",
    "it has alt - azimuth mount with two nasmyth and several bent cassegrain focal stations fed by a flat mirror m3 .",
    "this mirror can be actuated in tip and tilt .",
    "the soar adaptive module ( sam ) is an ao system for correcting wave - front distortions and feeding improved images to science instruments @xcite .",
    "sam has internal re - imaging optics ( two off - axis paraboloids ) , turbulence corrector ( 60-element curvature deformable mirror , dm ) , and a 10x10 shack - hartmann wave - front sensor ( wfs )",
    ". the sam instrument is designed to work with a laser guide star , but initially it used natural guide stars ( ngs ) .",
    "the light of an on - axis star was mostly reflected to the wfs by a neutral beamsplitter placed after the dm , with 14% transmitted to the science detector .",
    "the latter was a high - resolution camera ( hrcam ) which contained an em ccd with a pixel scale of 15.23mas and filters @xcite .",
    "owing to the @xmath6 light attenuation by the beamsplitter , we observed only relatively bright stars .",
    "sam was installed in august 2009 at the nasmyth focus , receiving the light after four reflections in the telescope .",
    "it rotates as a whole for compensating field rotation as the telescope tracks stars .",
    "the ao loop cycle was 4.3ms , with a 2-cycle delay between wfs measurement and correction . to compensate for this relatively slow loop",
    ", we used the smith predictor ( sp ) controller @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a standard leaky integrator ( int ) with a gain of 0.25 was tried .",
    "the degree of ao correction is equivalent to compansation of 45 zernike modes .    of the three engineering runs assigned to these tests in august - october 2009 ,",
    "the first was completely lost to clouds , the second produced 1.5 nights of data under fast and poor seeing of @xmath7 , the third and last run enjoyed few hours of good conditions ( seeing 05 to @xmath8 ) .",
    "we pointed telescope to single or multiple bright stars , closed the ao loop and recorded , typically , 400 images with 20-ms exposure time and em gain of 44 .",
    "only the central region of @xmath9 was recorded in most cases . in parallel , we frequently saved data from the ao loop ( sequences of centroids and dm voltages ) for off - line analysis .",
    "we calculate the first 45 zernike coefficients @xmath10 of the input ( atmospheric ) and corrected ( residual ) wave - fronts ( in radians at @xmath11 m ) from the ao loop data .",
    "the dm voltages are converted into corresponding slopes by matrix multiplication , using the recorded ao interaction matrix .",
    "the slopes , in turn , are converted into zernike coefficients by means of the calculated theoretical slopes of zernike modes ( gradient matrix ) ; we simply multiply the vector of slopes by the pseudo - inverse gradient matrix . of course",
    ", the zernike coefficients @xmath10 derived in this way contain errors due to noise on the measured slopes and cross - talk with higher - order modes ( aliasing ) .    the fried radius @xmath3 and seeing @xmath12 are estimated from the variance of zernike coefficients @xmath13 which should , in theory , equal @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the ratio of measured variances to the noll s coefficients @xmath15 is averaged using modes from 7 to 19 to get an estimate of @xmath1 .",
    "the atmospheric coherence time @xmath16 is derived from the temporal variation of the defocus coefficient @xmath17 , as described by @xcite .",
    "its values at @xmath11 m ranged from 1ms to 3.5ms .",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath16 derived from the loop data are in reasonable agreement with simultaneous measurements from the mass - dimm site monitor @xcite .",
    "temporal power spectra of the zernike coefficients corresponding to the input ( un - corrected ) wave - fronts are calculated from the dm signal , with division of the raw power spectrum by the theoretical frequency response of the closed ao loop .",
    "the high - frequency part of those spectra shows a typical power - law decline proportional to @xmath18 , with exponents @xmath19 between 2 and 3 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pow ] ) .",
    "a high - frequency asymptotic decline with @xmath20 is characteristic of atmospheric tilts , while a steeper dependence with @xmath21 is expected for the defocus and higher modes @xcite .",
    "this mismatch between theory and real spectra has also been observed with physically simulated turbulence in the laboratory and reproduced in the numerical simulations .",
    "most probably , it is caused by the atmospheric errors of wfs slope measurements @xcite and by the aliasing of higher - order modes , as shown by @xcite .",
    "the power spectra of the residual coefficients derived from the wfs signal show that distortions with low temporal frequencies ( up to 20hz ) are compensated , while high frequencies are amplified .",
    "this amplification is caused by the ao servo system and depends on the type of temporal controller used ; the sp controller gives more high - fequency errors than int .",
    "the spectra of residual coefficients match very well their expected shape  a product of the input disturbance and the ao loop error transfer function ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pow ] ) .",
    "quasi - periodic signals caused by vibrations are seen as narrow `` lines '' superposed on the otherwise smooth spectra of input or residual distortions .",
    "such lines are detected in modes up to 6 ( astigmatism ) , but are not present in the higher - order modes .",
    "the focus coefficient @xmath17 almost always has a line at 47hz .",
    "this frequency is too high to be caused by a real focus variation in the telescope .",
    "it is suspiciousy close to the 1/5 of the loop frequency and is likely of instrumental origin ( we do not see such signal in the laboratory , however ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the 50-hz component in the tip and tilt coefficients is real .",
    "this vibration is caused by the pick - up noise in the position sensors of the soar fast tip - tilt mirror , m3 .",
    "this signal is detected by the standard soar guider , as well as directly in the voltages of the m3 drives ( m.  warner , private communication ) . by extracting the 50-hz component from the sam loop signal , we show that motions on both axes are co - phased ( fig .  [",
    "fig : tilt ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of these vibrations and relative phase shift between the axes are not constant .",
    "on october 2 , 2009 , the worst - case rms amplitude was 19mas , the smallest one  3mas .",
    "as the typical exposure time in speckle interferometry is 20ms  one full period of the 50-hz vibration  the speckle structure is sometimes blurred and the resolution does not reach the diffraction limit ( 30mas in the visible ) . if the vibration ellipse is narrow , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tilt ] , the resulting blur can mimic a close binary with separation of 20 - 50mas .",
    "such effect was indeed seen in the previous speckle data obtained at soar ( tmh10 ) .",
    "it biases the measurements of very close binaries in un - controlled way .",
    "modification of the m3 drive electronics is in progress .",
    "once the 50-hz component is eliminated , there will be no other sources of fast blur , making the soar telescope most suitable for diffraction - limited observations .",
    "series of short - exposure images were processed in three different ways ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bu172 ] ) . in all cases",
    "we subtracted the average background to remove the fixed offset and the dark current which was non - negligible in a small number of `` hot '' pixes .",
    "all images are nyquist - sampled .",
    "* speckle interferometry * in its standard form is implemented as described in tmh10 .",
    "we compute the power spectrum from all images in each series , remove the photon - noise bias , filter out the low frequencies and derive by inverse fourier transform the average auto - correlation function ( acf ) .",
    "the phase information is lost , but the diffraction - limited resolution can be reached even without ao correction .",
    "we found that fast wave - front distortions amplified by the sp controller in closed loop ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pow ] ) blur the high - frequency structure in the 20-ms images and degrade the resolution in the speckle mode . at the same time this controller gives similar or smaller overall wave - front residuals as the int controller with a gain of 0.25",
    "; the resolution in the long - exposure images is also a little better with the sp controller .",
    "all data on binary stars were processed uniformly by speckle interferometry to derive relative component positions and magnitude differences ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : res ] ) .",
    "for the analysis of ao imaging performance , we de - convolve the binary signature ( as determined by the speckle processing ) and derive the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "* long - exposure images * were obtained as simple averages of the data cubes . typically , the total exposure was about 12s ( 30hz frame rate , 400 frames ) .",
    "as an option , we could re - center individual images before averaging ; the images were shifted by integer number of pixels as determined by their centroids .",
    "re - centering brings almost no resolution gain when the ao loop is closed .",
    "therefore we restrict further analysis to long - exposure images .",
    "* saa imaging * is implemented by selecting a certain fraction of the sharpest images in a given series and co - adding them with re - centering on the brightest pixel . in this case , the most prominent , diffraction - limited speckle is enhanced in the average image , while fainter speckles are averaged out and contribute to the diffuse halo . as a result ,",
    "a psf with a diffraction - limited core and a halo is obtained , reminiscent of partially - corrected ao images .",
    "combination of partial ao correction with re - centering on the brightest pixel gives better results than each of these methods alone .",
    "for the image selection , we experimented with different criteria such as second moment or sharpness and found that selection on the maximum image intensity works best , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "as to the fraction of retained images , it is not critical .",
    "the resolution gain is achieved mostly by re - centering , not by selection .",
    "we co - add the best 20% frames to produce the saa images . for faint stars ,",
    "the choice of the brightest pixel is affected by the noise , leading to a sharp 1-pixel spike at the center ; this spike was replaced by the average of its neighbours for psf evaluation . in the case of a binary star with components of comparable brightness , the noise and speckle fluctuations cause the brightest pixel to belong sometimes to the secondary component . as a result , a weaker false spike located symmetrically with respect to the primary component appears in the saa image .",
    "figure  [ fig : bin ] gives some representative images of multiple systems observed on october 2 , 2009 in closed loop with the sp controller .",
    "as expected , the best resolution in the long - exposure compensated images is reached in the @xmath22 band ( wavelength 0.8@xmath23 m ) , so most of the data were obtained in this filter . the resolution gain over",
    "un - compensated , seeing - limited imaging is impressive , even at shorter wavelengths .",
    "for example , three images taken one after another in the @xmath22 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 filters show the long - exposure fwhms of @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively under a @xmath29 seeing .",
    "the saa ( co - addition of re - centered images ) produces a fwhm with diffraction - limited core even without ao correction .",
    "we obtained such images from the data of 2008 - 2009 speckle runs at soar recorded under a 05 seeing .",
    "partial ao correction helps to concentrale the light in few bright speckles and thus enhances the range of conditions where this method works well @xcite .",
    "we found that under partial ao correction the saa post - processing yields a better resolution than simple averaging .",
    "however , as the seeing improves and the ao correction becomes good , the additional gain brought by this technique becomes less evident ( fig .",
    "[ fig : stat ] ) .",
    "average fwhm for the 22 points in fig .",
    "[ fig : stat ] is 025 and 018 for the long - exposure and saa , respectively .",
    "radial profiles of the psfs under good and partial ao correction are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : psf ] . for comparison ,",
    "gaussian profiles with the seeing - limited fwhm @xmath30 are given , using @xmath3 values estimated form the ao loop .",
    "the shape of the ao - corrected psfs is different from a gaussian and resembles a negative exponent .",
    "such psf is typical for an ao system like sam , according to our simulations .",
    "a detailed comparison of various processing techniques is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bu172 ] .",
    "the binary star bu  172 was observed at zenith distance @xmath31 under average seeing ( @xmath32 m to 0.14 m from the loop data ) .",
    "the first row demonstrates good compensation in the @xmath22 band ( long - exposure fhwm 018 ) achieved with the int loop controller .",
    "the saa and speckle processing increase the resolution to the point where the atmospheric dispersion ( 47mas in the direction parallel to the binary ) becomes visible .",
    "the dispersion is negligibly small ( 5mas ) in the narrow - band h@xmath33 filter , but the ao compensation at this longer wavelength is not so good ( fwhm 033 ) . the photon flux is low , so the saa method does not work very well , while the speckle processing gives a stronger signal .",
    "the images are elongated perpendicularly to the binary by the 50-hz vibrations ( see the insert ) of peak - to - peak amplitude 45mas , in this case .",
    "finally , when the sp controller is used , the images become more fuzzy because of the rapid residual wavefront jitter .",
    "however , the average image is even a little sharper ( fwhm 031 ) than with the int controller .",
    "although the binary bu  172 is bright , the flux is decreased by @xmath6 by the beamsplitter in sam and , further , by @xmath34 by the narrow - band h@xmath33 filter ( in comparison with @xmath24 or @xmath35 bands ) .",
    "therefore , the photon flux is equivalent to a binary star with @xmath36 observed in a wide band without sam beamsplitter .",
    "further gain in sensitivity by at least @xmath37 is achievable with a better detector ; the quantum efficiency is presently only about 0.5 , while the clock injection charge ( about 40 photons per frame ) is a serious limitation for faint stars .",
    "considering that this observation is not yet close to the limit , there are reasons to believe that stars down to @xmath38 can be observed at diffraction - limited resolution in speckle or lucky mode with sam .",
    "relative positions and magnitude difference in close binary stars were measured by speckle interferometry , following the same procedure as in tmh10 .",
    "we took advantage of that work to calibrate new results from sam on common wide systems and found that the pixel scale remained the same within errors , 15.23mas .",
    "an offset in position angle of @xmath39 has been determined and corrected . for the most part",
    ", we measured bright and well - known systems , although some recently discovered close pairs were also observed .",

    "as the separation in the wide pair ab is only @xmath50 , the triple system appears to be close to the dynamical stability limit .",
    "we can not exclude that the new companion is just an unrelated background source projecting on the ab .",
    "the companion c listed in the wds is in fact such a background source , as evidenced by its relative motion since 1897 .",

    "<S> bright single and binary stars were observed at the 4.1-m telescope with a fast electron - multiplication camera in the regime of partial turbulence correction by the visible - light adaptive optics system . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the angular resolution achieved by simple averaging of ao - corrected images ( long - exposure ) , selection and re - centering ( shift - and - add or `` lucky '' imaging ) and speckle interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of partial ao correction , vibrations , and image post - processing on the attained resolution is shown . </S>",
    "<S> potential usefulness of these techniques is evaluated for reaching the diffraction limit in ground - based optical imaging . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of 75 binary stars obtained during these tests are given and objects of special interest are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we report tentative resolution of the astrometric companion to @xmath0  aqr  b. a concept of advanced high - resolution camera is outlined . </S>"
