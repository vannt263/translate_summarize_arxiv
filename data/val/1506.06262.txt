    "in recent years , optical frequency combs ( ofcs ) have become fundamental tools for near infrared ( nir ) spectroscopy and metrology @xcite .",
    "thanks to their wide spectral coverage , high coherence and absolute traceability , they are used for high resolution and precision atomic and molecular spectroscopy in this spectral region @xcite . since the fundamental ro - vibrational transitions of simple molecules fall in the mid infrared ( mir ) , it is of particular interest to have ofcs operating in this spectral region . until now , a well - established approach to satisfy this need consisted of directly transferring nir ofcs emission to the mir region through nonlinear processes , e.g. difference frequency generation using intense fiber - based nir ofcs @xcite or optical parametric oscillators @xcite .",
    "this approach guarantees good spectral coverage and coherence , but requires complex and delicate experimental set - ups .",
    "comb generation has also been achieved by parametric oscillation in high - q micro resonators @xcite , with a spectral coverage recently extended to the mir region @xcite .",
    "quantum cascade lasers ( qcls ) @xcite are current - driven semiconductor lasers based on intersubband transitions in quantum wells , emitting mir or terahertz radiation . in devices designed with low group velocity dispersion , it has been shown that comb operation can be achieved @xcite thanks to the four - wave mixing process taking place in the gain medium itself @xcite . for mir - operating devices , the upper state lifetime , inherent to the intersubband transition of the active region ,",
    "is very short ( sub - picosecond range ) .",
    "this is responsible both for the broadband nature of the four - wave mixing process that enhances the mode - locking , but also for a tendency to operate with a mostly constant output power . for these reasons ,",
    "the phase relation between the modes is similar to that of frequency - modulated lasers @xcite , as predicted by theory @xcite , and no pulses are emitted .",
    "quantum cascade laser frequency combs ( qcl - combs ) were initially characterized by measuring the autocorrellation of the intermode beat note at the cavity round - trip frequency ( 7.5  ghz ) , performing a so - called beat note spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "a more sensitive technique is provided by comparing two qcl - combs in a heterodyne beat experiment .",
    "recent experiments on qcls in a dual - comb spectroscopy set - up demonstrated a mode equidistance as good as @xmath0 relative to the carrier optical frequency  @xcite , a value close to those measured for micro - resonator - based combs  @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we investigate the frequency noise of such combs .",
    "this characterization is essential both for spectroscopy applications as well as for a better understanding of the fundamental properties of these devices .",
    "the generation of the comb of frequencies is interpreted within the framework of supermodes .",
    "a high - finesse optical cavity has been used as a multimode frequency - to - amplitude converter to retrieve the qcl - comb intrinsic linewidth . a comparison between the linewidth obtained in the comb regime operation and in the single - mode operation is also given , demonstrating that the four - wave mixing process effectively correlates the quantum noise of the comb lines .",
    "what distinguishes a frequency comb from a simple array of perfectly equally spaced single - frequency optical sources is the correlation of the frequency noise .",
    "while the heterodyne beat of two independent single - frequency laser sources always yields a linewidth wider than that of the individual lasers , this is not the case if the two single frequencies are extracted from a frequency comb source .",
    "these considerations are equally true for technical as well as for quantum noise .",
    "the intrinsic linewidth of a laser is given by the schawlow - townes formula @xcite and can be interpreted as the ratio of the number of photons emitted in the cavity by spontaneous emission over the number of the ones emitted by stimulated emission . as compared to a single - frequency device",
    ", the only effect of comb operation is the redistribution of the stimulated photons into equally spaced modes .",
    "for this reason , the intrinsic linewdith of a single comb line is expected to be unchanged and can be expressed by the schawlow - townes formula considering the total optical power of all comb lines .    as in micro - resonators - based combs ,",
    "qcl - combs are generated through a four - wave mixing process .",
    "for this reason , starting from a semiclassical approach for qcl - combs @xcite , it makes sense to compare the quantities with the quantum formalism developed for micro - resonators - based combs @xcite to retrieve the langevin equation for the photon annihilation operator related to the @xmath1-th qcl - comb line : @xmath2 where @xmath3 with @xmath4 spatial superposition integral among the modes involved in the four - wave mixing process , @xmath5 photon lifetime in the laser cavity , @xmath6 scattering rate out of the excited laser state , @xmath7 loss of coherence of the laser transition , @xmath8 comb line spacing ( cavity round trip , without dispersion ) , @xmath9 peak gain , @xmath10 difference between the frequency of the @xmath1-th mode of the ideal laser cavity @xmath11 and the frequency of the @xmath1-th mode of the laser cavity with dispersion .",
    "@xmath12 are the vacuum langevin noise operators related to the optical loss processes ( waveguide and mirrors ) @xcite , characterized by the following statistical properties : @xmath13 the second term in equation  [ eq : eq_operator_comb ] is due to the four - wave mixing and it is responsible for the coupling among all the laser modes . solving equation  [ eq : eq_operator_comb ] is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we note that in comb operation the average relative phases of the modes are fixed ( within fluctuations ) .",
    "therefore , through a unitary transformation , it is possible to select a new basis for the cavity modes , the _ supermodes _ basis , such that one of this supermodes corresponds to that selected by the comb operation @xcite .",
    "the new annihilation operators are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the element of a unitary matrix such that @xmath16 @xcite . in this way",
    ", the equation is reduced to that of a single - mode laser ( with only one mode excited ) . in particular , the langevin operators for the new modes @xmath17 will have the same correlation properties ( equations [ eq : noise_op_st_prop ] ) because of the unitary nature of the transformation .",
    "the resulting frequency noise is expected to be the same of a single - mode laser .",
    "the laser used for these experiments is a qcl - comb based on an ingaas / inalas broadband design with multiple active regions ( multistack ) , previously reported in  @xcite .",
    "it operates in continuous wave at room temperature emitting several milliwatts of power at @xmath18 m .",
    "the device length is @xmath19  mm , corresponding to @xmath20  ghz .",
    "two main operation regimes are observed in this device . just above threshold ,",
    "the device emits single - mode radiation .",
    "a _ comb regime _ is then observed for a significant part of the device working range ( see figure [ fig : cavsetuppow ] ) .",
    "this very convenient property enabled us to study and compare the linewidth in both regimes ( single - mode and comb ) in the same device .    in order to investigate the frequency noise power spectral density ( fnpsd ) , a high - finesse optical cavity ( _ fabry - prot _ , @xmath21 ) was used to resolve the laser spectrum and to detect the frequency fluctuations of the laser , acting as frequency - to - amplitude ( fa ) converter ( figure  [ fig : cavsetuppow ] ) . in the set - up , an optical isolator ( transmission @xmath22  db , extinction @xmath23",
    "db ) has been used to avoid the instabilities induced on the laser by the back - reflection from the input mirror of the cavity . to collect the signal transmitted by the cavity , a high - sensitivity nitrogen - cooled hgcdte ( mct ) detector ( @xmath24  mhz ) was used . a 12-bit vertical resolution , 1  ghz analog bandwidth , 2.5  gs / s sampling rate oscilloscope was used to collect the signal and to compute its fourier transform .",
    "the distance between the two mirrors was chosen in order to set the free spectral range ( @xmath25 ) of the cavity close to the comb line spacing @xmath8 . in order to resolve the laser spectrum , a",
    "_ vernier ratio _ @xmath26 slightly different from one was chosen and a piezoelectric actuator was used to scan the cavity length over one @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "a schematic representation is depicted in figure  [ fig : trasmcav]a .    to utilize the cavity as a fa converter",
    ", we acted again on the piezoelectric actuator and on the temperature controller of the laser to set @xmath27 and to let the comb offset frequency @xmath28 be equal to the one of the optical cavity . in this way ,",
    "the comb lines and the optical cavity resonances were perfectly matched ( see figure  [ fig : trasmcav]b ) . as a consequence , in these conditions and _ only _ in these conditions of temperature and driving current of the laser , all the comb lines were transmitted by the cavity .",
    "the cavity can thus be used as a _ multimode _",
    "frequency - to - amplitude converter to collect the frequency fluctuations of all the modes at the same time @xcite ( see supplement [ sec : multi_freqamp_conv ] for a demonstration ) . since @xmath27 , an accurate value of the optical cavity free spectral range @xmath25 can be obtained by measuring @xmath8 .",
    "the latter was measured by acquiring the intermode beat note on the laser current with a spectrum analyzer @xcite .",
    "an accurate value of the cavity @xmath25 is needed for the calibration of the fa converter .",
    "under optimal conditions of current and temperature for the matching , the laser emits a power @xmath29  mw .",
    "thanks to the high finesse , it is also possible to collect the frequency fluctuations of an individual comb line by slightly varying the @xmath25 . a spectrum retrieved with the laser in single - mode operating conditions ( @xmath30  mw ) was also acquired .",
    "the fnpsd measured on the single - mode regime as well as on the comb regime are reported in figure  [ fig : fnpsd]a after correction for the finite bandwidth of the fa converter ( response frequency cutoff of the high - finesse cavity related to the photon lifetime ) .",
    "we observe that the frequency noise on the comb regime is identical to the frequency noise on the single - mode regime .",
    "moreover , the frequency noise of an individual comb line is also equivalent to the one acquired on all the comb lines together . by integrating the fnpsd using elliott s formula @xcite , the full width at high maximum ( fwhm ) of a laser mode can be retrieved . in our case",
    ", we obtain a fwhm of about 600  khz in a 1-s timescale , which is consistent with the linewidth shown by distributed - feedback ( dfb ) qcls @xcite . moreover , the contributions of the driver noise and the laser intensity noise as well as the detection noise floor are reported .",
    "taking into account the detection noise floor shape , the spectra are reliable up to 3  mhz",
    ". around 1  mhz , a flattening can be observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : fnpsd]b shows a portion of the same fnpsd spectrum ( from 100  khz to 3  mhz ) .",
    "this flattening , characteristic of a white frequency noise , corresponds to the intrinsic quantum noise level @xmath31 due to the spontaneous emission , the so called _ schawlow - townes limit _ @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare this level @xmath31 to the one expected for a single - mode device with the same characteristics @xcite : @xmath32 taking @xmath33  thz as central frequency , @xmath29  mw as total power emitted by the laser , @xmath34 as mirror losses , @xmath35 as total losses ( the relatively high waveguide losses are due to the residual _ cross - absorption _ given by the multistack structure ) , @xmath36 , @xmath37 as spontaneous emission factor and @xmath38 as squared _ henry linewidth enhancement factor _ averaged over the laser spectrum ( see supplement [ sec : henry_est ] ) , we obtain @xmath39  hz , value which is consistent with the one obtained from the spectrum @xmath40  hz ( figure  [ fig : fnpsd]b ) .",
    "this justifies the theoretical framework introduced in section [ sec : freqnoise ] .",
    "more importantly , the measurement of the fnpsd in comb regime shows that the quantum fluctuations of the different modes are correlated .",
    "in fact , we observe that the fnpsd  in particular the portion limited by the quantum noise  is identical when measured with one comb line and with all comb lines simultaneously .",
    "this quantum limit ",
    "value which is given by the schawlow - townes expression  would be at least a factor of 6 larger than the one showed in figure [ fig : fnpsd]b , assuming that the quantum fluctuations of each comb mode are uncorrelated .",
    "this factor is outside our uncertainty .",
    "with this work we have demonstrated that in quantum cascade laser frequency combs the four - wave mixing process at the origin of the comb operation regime is also responsible for the correlation between the frequency fluctuations between the modes until the quantum limit . as a result , the linewidth is shown to be limited by the schawlow - townes formula , as it is for single - mode lasers of the same total power . as a consequence ,",
    "instruments using the spectral multiplexing of dual - combs or multi - heterodyne spectrometers hold an inherent noise advantage compared to similar systems using arrays of single - mode lasers .",
    "finally , the same technique used to retrieve the frequency noise power spectral density could be used to implement an active stabilization for locking this combs to high - finesse ultra - stable optical cavities .",
    "this work was financially supported by the swiss national science foundation , the eth pioneer fellowship programme , the european laboratory for non - linear spectroscopy ( florence ) and the italian national institute of optics ( cnr - ino ) .",
