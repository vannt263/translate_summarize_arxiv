    "the origin of the short - hard gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ; durations @xmath2 s ; @xcite ) was largely a matter of speculation until the recent discovery of their afterglows and host galaxies ( e.g. , refs .",
    "these observations have demonstrated that sgrbs are cosmological in origin ( @xmath3 ; @xcite ) ; have a beaming - corrected energy scale of @xmath4 erg @xcite ; lack associated supernovae ( e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; occur in a mix of star - forming and elliptical galaxies @xcite ; have a broad spatial distribution around their hosts @xcite , with some events offset by tens of kpc @xcite ; and have low - density parsec - scale environments @xcite .",
    "the confluence of these characteristics provides support to the popular model of compact object ( co ) mergers @xcite .    in this context , the key open question that motivates our paper is the following : if sgrbs originate in co mergers , what types of compact objects are merging ? specifically , a neutron star ( ns ) can theoretically be tidally disrupted by , and produce an accretion disk around , either a more compact ns , or a sufficiently small stellar mass black hole ( bh ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to distinguish between mergers of neutron star binaries ( ns - ns ) and mixed binaries ( bh - ns ) .",
    "the advent of gravitational wave ( gw ) astronomy will facilitate this task , but distinguishing the waveforms accompanying ns - ns mergers from those in bh - ns mergers is a nontrivial task @xcite , and furthermore the advanced ligo era is still half a decade away .",
    "it is also possible that gw signals seen by advanced ligo will lack accompanying electromagnetic counterparts if the sgrb beaming angle is too small , or if the intrinsic event rate is too low . in this paper",
    "we suggest a clear observational tool for distinguishing between ns - ns and bh - ns progenitors of sgrbs using electromagnetic data only : the precession of the disks and jets associated with these events .",
    "jet precession has previously been discussed as a phenomenon relevant for sgrbs , originally with regard to now - disfavored sgrb models @xcite but later in the context of co mergers .",
    "early works in the co merger paradigm considered disks fed by stable mass transfer from a ns onto a bh so that the precession was forced by tidal torques @xcite , but subsequent models considered the more realistic neutrino - dominated accretion flows ( ndafs ) formed after tidal disruption of a ns by a stellar mass bh @xcite . this last model is similar to the one presented in this paper , in that it considers a thick disk precessing as a solid body rotator due to general relativistic lense - thirring torques .",
    "it has been applied to predict different observational signatures , such as the light curves of precessing jets @xcite or even ligo - band gw signals emitted by forced precession of a large amount of disk mass @xcite .",
    "others have considered an inclined disk whose inner regions include a bardeen - petterson warp ; in their model the inner region of a ndaf precesses along with the bh spin about the total angular momentum vector @xcite .",
    "the above papers generally treat disk precession in an analytic or semianalytic way , due to the high computational expense of even newtonian simulations . however , the late inspiral , plunge , and merger of a bh - ns binary has been repeatedly simulated in full numerical relativity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , providing a detailed picture of the initial conditions dictating subsequent disk evolution . shortly after the first numerical relativity simulations of a bh - bh merger @xcite",
    ", fully relativistic bh - ns mergers were simulated by multiple groups @xcite .",
    "the results of these early simulations were later refined , and subsequent work considered the effects of varied mass ratios @xcite , bh spin @xcite , ns compactness and equation of state @xcite , spin - orbit misalignment @xcite , orbital eccentricity @xcite , and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "although disk precession has been seen in misaligned bh - ns merger simulations @xcite , the semianalytic approach of this paper has two main advantages over numerical simulation : we both consider the evolution of the remnant accretion disk over long time scales , and finely sample the broad parameter space of these events .",

    "we estimate the fraction of bh - ns mergers that can actually produce accretion disks .",

    "v ) . unlike in previous work",
    ", we discuss both the case where the jet is tied to the bh spin vector , and the case where it aligns with the disk angular momentum vector .",
    "nonaxisymmetric torques will , initially , induce small warps in accretion disks due to differential precession between adjacent mass annuli .",
    "the evolution of these warps depends on how they are able to propagate through the disk .",
    "when the disk is sufficiently viscous , warps propagate diffusively , allowing differential precession to produce substantial shear viscosity , and dissipating large amounts of orbital energy . in the context of tilted accretion disks experiencing lense - thirring torques from bh",
    "spin , diffusive propagation of warps will align the inner regions of the disk with the black hole equatorial plane ; this is known as the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite .    in the opposite regime , a thick disk with a short sound - crossing time scale will propagate warps in a wavelike manner , redistributing torques throughout the disk and inducing near - rigid body precession @xcite . in particular , rigid body precession is possible if @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the disk height and @xmath7 the dimensionless viscosity parameter at a radius @xmath8 .",
    "this is the regime most relevant for compact object mergers , and is therefore what we will consider for the remainder of this paper .",
    "approximately rigid body precession has been seen in hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary disks being torqued by a binary companion @xcite , in grmhd simulations of tilted accretion disks around spinning black holes @xcite , and , notably , in nr simulations of bh - ns mergers @xcite .    in the newtonian limit , a solid body rotator will precess with a period @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the misalignment angle between the accretion disk and the bh equatorial plane , @xmath11 is the total angular momentum of the disk , and @xmath12 is the lense - thirring torque integrated over the entire disk . specifically , if the disk possesses a surface density profile @xmath13 that is nonzero between an inner radius @xmath14 and an outer radius @xmath15 , and the disk elements possess orbital frequency @xmath16 , then @xmath17 and @xmath18 where the bh s mass and dimensionless spin are @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",

    "other effects that would influence eq . include nutation and relativistic corrections to the orbital frequency , which we neglect in this analysis ( but see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we stress that @xmath29 is an instantaneous precession period , and that for the nonequilibrium disks expected in co mergers important quantities such as @xmath30 and @xmath31 will be time dependent ( although the cancellation of @xmath32 in @xmath33 means that the secular decrease in disk mass will _ not _ affect @xmath29 ) .",
    "the time dependence of these variables will cause any signal to be quasiperiodic rather than periodic . because the dominant feature of the disk s dynamical evolution will be viscous outward spreading @xcite",
    ", we expect @xmath29 to increase with time .",
    "although a power law definition of @xmath34 is appealing for its simplicity , both analytical models @xcite and nr simulations @xcite indicate that the true structure of these disks is more complex .",
    "to better account for realistic disk structure , and also to quantify the time evolution of the disk as it spreads outward , we adopt the sgrb disk model of ref .",
    "@xcite , which derives exact @xmath34 solutions for a viscously spreading ring of matter , and then couples these solutions to more detailed models of disk energetics and composition . as matter from the disk accretes onto the bh , the intially advective ndaf will become optically thin to neutrinos and geometrically thinner . at later times ( @xmath35 sec )",
    "the disk will become a geometrically thick , radiatively inefficient accretion flow . in principle , the intermediate neutrino - cooled period could prevent later disk precession by aligning the disk into the bh midplane through the creation of a bardeen - petterson warp . in practice , it seems that even the neutrino - cooled phase of accretion still possesses @xmath5 , and is therefore unlikely to align ( ref .",
    "@xcite , fig .",

    ", we can write the surface density as @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the initial disk mass , @xmath39 is the initial radius of the spreading mass ring ( i.e. the radius where the ns is disrupted ) , @xmath40 is a modified bessel function of order @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and we have assumed viscosity of the form @xmath44 .",
    "we calibrate @xmath45 with the initial relation @xmath46 and the equation @xmath47 where @xmath7 is the dimensionless shakura - sunyaev viscosity coefficient and @xmath48 is the characteristic disk height .",

    "the importance of @xmath7 for our results lies primarily in how viscosity controls the outward spreading of the disk , so we follow ref .",

    "we have assumed that the angular momentum lost by inspiralling disk matter is redistributed outward solely by internal viscous torques .",
    "an alternate possibility is specific angular momentum loss through a disk wind , which if magnetized can further torque the disk @xcite . adopting the simple `` adios '' model for disk wind losses @xcite , i.e. @xmath80 and @xmath81 , we can use the similarity solutions of ref .",

    "the disk mass and accretion rate will decline more rapidly than in the wind free case , with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    on the other hand , if the outflow exerts a significant magnetic torque on the disk ( @xmath85 ) , then @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "both analytic @xcite and numerical works @xcite have suggested that a value of @xmath88 is roughly appropriate for radiatively inefficient flows .",
    "this yields @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and a rapidly declining disk mass , with @xmath91 . if this is the case , @xmath92 for all realistic @xmath7 values , but the rapid loss of disk mass may make precession more difficult to observe ( as discussed in sec .",

    "the observational signatures of jet precession will hinge on two uncertain astrophysical questions : the opening angles of sgrb jets and the alignment direction of a jet in a tilted accretion flow .",
    "the first of these questions has recently become amenable to observational constraint ; observations of jet breaks in sgrbs suggest opening angles of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "observational evidence for the second question is limited , and ambiguous .",
    "observations of a relativistic outflow following tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive bh ( swift j164449.3 + 573451 ) suggested that in that case , the jet aligned with the bh spin axis @xcite ; on the other hand , observations of the microquasar lsi+61303 have been interpreted as evidence of a precessing jet , aligned with the angular momentum axis of a precessing disk @xcite .",
    "there may not be a universal answer to this question , as different hypothetical jet launching mechanisms might each tie the jet axis to a different preferred direction .",
    "however , for the two leading jet launching mechanism candidates in sgrbs - @xmath103 pair annihilation @xcite , and the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite - there are theoretical reasons to believe that the jet will align with the disk angular momentum vector .",
    "the @xmath103 annihilation scenario is independent of bh spin and depends only on disk properties .",
    "alignment of a bz - powered jet is more ambiguous , but recent works that have considered jet precession in sgrbs assumed that a jet powered by the bz mechanism will align with the disk angular momentum vector @xcite because the magnetic field is anchored in the disk .",
    "this assumption has been further supported by nr simulations of force - free electromagnetic fields around spinning bhs @xcite , which found that the direction of poynting flux from the bz mechanism is governed by larger - scale magnetic fields and not the bh spin vector , although we note that grmhd simulations of tilted accretion flows with matter have until very recently been unable to resolve jets @xcite . while this paper was under peer review , the first grmhd results on tilted jets appeared in the literature @xcite ; in these simulations a collimated jet aligned with the bh spin vector out to a distance of @xmath104 before bending to align with the disk angular momentum vector .",
    "thus radiation from bz - powered jets may contain precessing and nonprecessing components , depending on the distance from the bh where the radiation originates .",
    "a final self - consistency check on our model involves the expected duration of significant jet luminosity from these events .",
    "although the details are uncertain , a simple semianalytic model for jet luminosity @xcite found that accretion rates above @xmath105 are required to sustain a luminous grb ( this model also found that the bz mechanism typically dominates @xmath106 annihilation ) .    from this criterion and eq . , we see that our fiducial sgrb duration of @xmath107 , originally chosen on observational grounds @xcite , is well motivated internally as well .",
    "this criterion for jet duration implies that the event typically lasts between one and several viscous time scales , which are largely controlled by @xmath7 . for @xmath108 ,",
    "the initial viscous time scale for a @xmath109 bh is @xmath110 .",
    "this time scale grows as the disk expands , so that an sgrb that stays active for @xmath111 lasts for @xmath112 viscous time scales . as",
    "only the lower viscosities we consider are likely to produce @xmath113 , a typical bh - ns sgrb accompanied by an observably precessing jet will last for a few viscous times . when we calculate @xmath77 at later points in this paper , we integrate between times of 20 ms and 1s .",
    "the lower bound is the approximate time by which simulations of misaligned bh - ns merger disks reach a steady state and begin exhibiting solid body precession @xcite .",
    "because large amplitude precession requires large amplitude misalignment of the postmerger bh and its accretion disk , we must consider which co mergers can actually produce misaligned disks . despite their larger premerger spin - orbit misalignment , ns - ns mergers are unlikely to produce significantly misaligned disks . if one or both members of the ns - ns binary were millisecond pulsars , disk precession could be feasible : spin angular momentum @xmath114 , and the orbital angular momentum at the disruption radius @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the misalignment angle @xmath10 between the postmerger accretion disks ( which we assume to lie in the initial orbital plane ) and the bh spin axis will be @xmath116 in ns - ns mergers involving one star with a ms spin period , if we assume initially orthogonal spin and orbital angular momentum vectors .",
    "standard population synthesis channels indicate , however , that the one recycled component of ns binaries typically has a minimum spin period of @xmath117 @xcite , which would imply @xmath118 , a value that is likely too small to carry significant observational consequences .",
    "although the current sample of ns - ns binary spin measurements is limited , the fastest rotator discovered so far has a 22 ms spin period @xcite , far too slow to produce large amplitude disk precession .    in bh - ns mergers ,",
    "however , the bh may possess a larger natal reservoir of spin angular momentum , allowing for greater misalignment between the postmerger bh and the disk formed from ns debris ( which we have assumed to lie in the initial orbital plane ) .",
    "natal spin is the most relevant quantity , although subsequent mass transfer onto the bh may produce modest changes in @xmath20 @xcite . for a bh - ns system ,",
    "the relevant numbers are @xmath119 and @xmath120 , where @xmath20 is the dimensionless black hole spin , and we define the mass ratio @xmath121 . for @xmath122 and @xmath97 , the disk misalignment angle @xmath123 , which is large enough to be observationally interesting . here",
    "we have also assumed initially orthogonal spin and orbital angular momentum vectors .",
    "these simple newtonian estimates motivate an investigation of bh - disk misalignment in bh - ns mergers , but are insufficient for accurately estimating either postmerger bh spin @xmath124 or the misalignment angle @xmath10 between @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "this is because they do not account for the fully dynamical , strong field gr effects that accompany compact object mergers .",
    "recently , empirical post - newtonian ( pn ) formulas were derived to calculate these quantities in the case of bh - bh mergers @xcite .",
    "these formulas have a large number of free parameters that were calibrated based on a suite of nr simulations .",
    "because disruptions of nss by bhs are so marginal ( i.e. occur so close to the isso ) , it is reasonable to expect these formulas to have some utility in making predictions for bh - ns mergers ; we show in appendix b that they are in fact quite accurate when tested against nr simulations of bh - ns coalescence . for this reason",
    ", we use these pn formulas to calculate the final spin @xmath124 for a bh formed by the merger of a bh - ns with mass ratio @xmath126 , premerger bh spin @xmath127 , and a premerger spin - orbit misalignment angle @xmath128 .",
    "we approximate the premerger ns spin magnitude as @xmath129 .",
    "finally , we calculate @xmath130 .    even though the pn formulas in appendix b reproduce @xmath124 with reasonable accuracy , our assumption that the postmerger disk tilt @xmath10 is described by the angle between the initial orbital plane and @xmath124 may overestimate @xmath10 . when we compare our calculations to the late - time ( @xmath131 ) results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we appear to overestimate @xmath10 by a factor @xmath132 , although our approach provides a significantly more accurate estimate of early - time disk tilt",
    ". similar evolution of disk tilt is not seen in steady - state grmhd disk simulations @xcite but is likely at least partially physical for the early stages of bh - ns mergers , as the disk adjusts to an equilibrium configuration . however",
    ", numerical viscosity may also play a role in reducing the disk tilt in misaligned nr simulations @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we do not model the time evolution of @xmath10 , but this probably results in overestimates of @xmath133 , which we note again in sec .",
    "v.    the final component in our calculation is a criterion for sgrb production in a bh - ns merger .",
    "the tidal radius , defined in the newtonian limit as @xmath134 , is appealing for this purpose : only a fraction @xmath135 of all bh - ns mergers will produce an accretion disk and jet , because if @xmath136 , the ns is swallowed whole .",
    "however , while the tidal radius is cleanly defined in other contexts @xcite , in the case of relativistic , comparable mass mergers it is not obvious that the newtonian definition is applicable @xcite . furthermore , the gravitational radius @xmath137 . in light of these complications ,",
    "we adopt a fitting formula for the initial remnant disk mass @xmath38 , calibrated from nr simulations of aligned bh - ns mergers @xcite : @xmath138 although this fitting formula was calibrated from nr data on aligned mergers , we generalize it to misaligned mergers by substituting @xmath139 for @xmath140 .",
    "this appears to reproduce nr simulations of misaligned postmerger disks reasonably well ( appendix b ) .",
    "overall , the fitting formula s accuracy is comparable to a more complex theoretical model for @xmath38 using the `` affine ellipsoids '' approximation @xcite .",
