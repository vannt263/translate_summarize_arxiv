    "the availability of data about large real - world networked systems  commonly known as complex networks  has demanded the development of several graph - theoretic and algebraic methods to study the structure and dynamical properties of such usually giant graphs @xcite . in a seminal paper ,",
    "watts and strogatz @xcite introduced one of such graph - theoretic indices to characterize the transitivity of relations in complex networks .",
    "the so - called clustering coefficient represents the ratio of the number of triangles in which the corresponding node takes place to the the number of potential triangles involving that node ( see further for a formal definition ) .",
    "the clustering coefficient of a node is bounded between zero and one , with values close to zero indicating that the relative number of transitive relations involving that node is low . on the other hand",
    ", a clustering coefficient close to one indicates that this node is involved in as many transitive relations as possible . when studying complex real - world networks it is very common to report the average watts - strogatz ( ws ) clustering coefficient @xmath0 as a characterization of how globally clustered a network is @xcite",
    "such idea , however , was not new as reflected by the fact that luce and perry @xcite had proposed 50 years earlier an index to account for the network transitivity , given by the total number of triangles in the graph divided by the total number of triads existing in the graph .",
    "such index , hereafter called the graph transitivity @xmath1 , was then rediscovered by newman @xcite in the context of complex networks . here again this index is bounded between zero and one , with small values indicating poor transitivity and values close to one indicating a large one ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it was first noticed by bollobs @xcite and then by estrada @xcite that there are certain graphs for which the two clustering coefficients diverge .",
    "that is , there are classes of graphs for which the ws average clustering coefficient tends to one while the graph transitivity tends to zero as the size of the graphs grows to infinity .",
    "the two families indentified by bollobs @xcite and by estrada @xcite are illustrated in figure [ examples ] and they correspond to the so - called _ friendship _ ( or dutch windmill or @xmath2-fan ) _ graphs _ @xcite and _ agave graphs _",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the friendship graphs are formed by glueing together @xmath3 copies of a triangle in a common vertex .",
    "the agave graphs are formed by connecting @xmath4 disjoint nodes to both nodes of a complete graph @xmath5 .",
    "the friendship graphs are members of a larger family of graphs known as the _ windmill graphs _",
    "a windmill graph @xmath6 consists of @xmath3 copies of the complete graph @xmath7 @xcite with every node connected to a common one ( see figure [ windmill graphs ] ) . in a recent paper estrada @xcite has proved that the divergence of the two clustering coefficient indices also takes place for windmill graphs when the number of nodes tends to infinity .",
    "the agave graphs belong to the general class of complete split graphs , which are the graphs consisting of a central clique and a disjoint set of nodes which are connected to all the nodes of the clique @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this divergence between the two clustering coefficients also takes place in certain real - world networks @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has passed inadverted among the plethora of papers that deals with clustering in real - world networks . in table",
    "[ table1 ] we illustrate some results collected from the literature in which the divergence of the two clustering coefficients is observed .",
    "the dataset is selected to intentionally display the heterogeneity of classes of real - world networks which display such phenomenon .",

    "we prove here that the clustering coefficients of these graphs diverge and that they are always disassortative .",
    "we also characterize completely the eigenstructure of the adjacency and the laplacian matrices of these graphs , and comment on the asymptotic behavior of such quantities as the infection threshold and synchronizability index of these graphs .",

    "another important network parameter is the degree assortativity coefficient which measures the tendency of high degree nodes to be connected to other high degree nodes ( assortativity ) or to low degree ones ( disassortativity ) .",

    "we consider a group of central nodes in a network which are connected among them .",
