    "noncommutative spaces have been of current interest with various motivations , in particular they arise in the framework of m - theory and in interesting settings of string and branes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( the bibliography is so vast that we do not attempt comprehensive referencing ) .",
    "a sector of the study of the physics in noncommutative spaces concerns the exploration of the consequences for the quantum mechanics of one particle @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    the physics in the noncommutative spaces is closely related to the problem of a charged particle moving on a surface with constant magnetic field giving rise to landau levels ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "hence it is interesting to study landau levels by comparing the settings of commutative and noncommutative spaces .",
    "this research has been carried out for the case of the plane @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , the sphere@xcite and the torus @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the landau levels problem in the case of a surface of negative constant curvature , that is @xmath0 .",
    "the commutative case has been studied in various papers , @xcite , @xcite , and also been extended to cover the case of the higher genus riemann surfaces , which can be realized by a tessellation of @xmath0 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we may note in passing that , as higher genus riemann surfaces appear as building blocks of higher orders in string perturbation theory , this provides a further link between @xmath1 spaces and string theory , besides the celebrated relation with conformal field theories .",
    "we first of all recall in section ii the results on the commutative @xmath1 surface , by making an explicit derivation , using appropriate complex coordinates and giving the resulting eigenfunctions , eigenvalues and their ( infinite ) multiplicity .",
    "we may also recall that for higher genus riemann surfaces one gets the same spectrum but with a finite multiplicity dictated by the riemann - roch theorem @xcite .",
    "then we give the algebraic formulation of the same problem , by expressing the hamiltonian in terms of the generators of @xmath2 and representing @xmath0 as an embedding of a surface in the flat @xmath3-dimensional minkowski space .    in the case of the riemann surfaces a quantization condition for the magnetic field naturally emerges .",
    "indeed , the wave function can be regarded as a differential form on the surface ( which is in fact the proper object of the riemann - roch theorem ) and the requirement of definite monodromy for transport along noncontractible loops implies a quantization condition .",
    "one can also require some periodicity properties of the wave function in the noncompact case of @xmath0 , like it is common to use peridodic boundary conditions in quantum mechanical problems on noncompact spaces , for instance on the plane .",
    "the results are actually the same , except one has to assume a quantized value for the magnetic field .    the algebric formulation of section ii will allow us to properly define the analogous problem in the noncommutative setting , section iiia .",
    "the commutation relations among the minkowski space coordinates are taken to be the ones of the @xmath2 , and the appropriate casimir is fixed in order to define the embedding in this case , similarly to the construction for the noncommutative sphere done in ref@xcite .",
    "the resulting setting is described by two commuting @xmath2 algebrae .",
    "we have not attempted the construction of noncommutative higher genus riemann surfaces .",
    "we have first of all to define the hamiltonian for the noncommutative case : we assume it to be formally identical to the one defined on the commutative surface .",
    "the next issue concerns how to define the constant magnetic field .",
    "here we have studied two options .    in the first one",
    ", we fix the two casimirs of the two commuting @xmath2 algebrae , similarly to what was done in ref@xcite for the sphere . with this option",
    "the hamiltonian for the noncommutative case may not be formally the same as for the commutative surface , and the commutative limit may require some care and adjustment of parameters appearing in the hamiltonian , see ref@xcite . here , we see that this option can be in conflict with the requirement that a universal ( commuting or noncommuting ) form of the hamiltonian makes physical sense .    in the second option",
    ", we keep fixed one observable among a complete set of mutually commuting ones .",
    "this observable is formally identical to the magnetic field defined in the commutative case . in this case , retaining the same hamiltonian , formally identical to the one defined on the commutative surface , makes always physical sense , and the commutative limit is straightforward .    by using the representation theory",
    "we obtain the spectrum in both options , section iiib and section iiic respectively .",
    "this is done in general for all possible representations of the algebra to yield the spectrum .",
    "requiring , in addition , quantization of the eigenvalues in order to explore the possible noncommutative generalization of the features holding for riemann surfaces , implies retaining only a quite small subset of the levels .",
    "actually , the construction of the landau levels on the noncommutative version of the riemann surfaces remains so far a completely unsolved problem , despite announcements which may have appeared in the title of some paper .",
    "we consider a constant magnetic field on @xmath0 , that is a magnetic field proportional to the curvature .",
    "we can describe @xmath0 by using complex coordinates @xmath4 in the upper half plane @xmath5 and taking the poincare metric @xmath6 : ds^2= dx^2+dy^2 y^2 .",
    "[ metric ]    the relevant covariant derivatives are = + b z-|z .5truecm |= |+b z-|z .[nabla ] and = b/(2y^2 ) .",
    "we take the hamiltonian as h & = & -2g^z|z(|+| ) - b^2 + & = & -4g^z|z|+b(1-b ) + & = & -4g^z|z|-b(1+b ) .",
    "[ hamiltonian ]    notice that , by taking into account the appropriate measure , the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are both semipositive definite , and therefore    h|b|(1-|b| ) .",
    "[ bound ] we take @xmath9 , since the case @xmath10 is obtained by interchanging @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath13 the lowest eigenstate , i.e. @xmath14 , is obtained as a solution of @xmath15 .    by defining @xmath16",
    "we see that this means @xmath17 .",
    "this state is not unique .",
    "the different states can be labeled by the eigenvalues of an operator ( that commutes with @xmath18 ) , which we will , in the following , identify with a generator of @xmath2 : j_3=-i2((1+z^2)+(1+|z^2)|+(z-|z)b ) .",
    "[ j3 ] the explicit form of the set of lowest level eigenstates is _ 0^(n)= ( z-|z)^b ( i+z)^2b ( -i+z i+z)^n , corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath19 , with @xmath20 any nonnegative integer .",
    "we observe that under a holomorphic coordinate transformation @xmath21 the wave function @xmath22 transforms like a differential form of the kind @xmath23 .",
    "that is , if @xmath24 is another local coordinate on the surface and the domain of @xmath24 intersect the domain of @xmath11 , we first observe that @xmath25 and that @xmath26 with @xmath27 . therefore the wave function in the new coordinates is related to the wave function in the old ones by @xmath28 that is @xmath29 is invariant .",
    "it follows that @xmath30 transforms like a @xmath31 form .",
    "also , the wave functions for the excited levels can be expressed as ( we abbreviate , @xmath32 ) _",
    "l^(n ) = g^b/2 - 1g^-(b/2 - 1)g^b/2 - 2 g^-(b/2 - 2 ) g^b/2-lg^-(b/2-l ) , where @xmath33 is a @xmath34 form .",
    "the eigenfunction equation requires @xmath35 , which is a @xmath36 form , to be holomorphic .    in conclusion the wave functions of the operator @xmath37 are in correspondence with @xmath38 holomorphic forms .",
    "on a riemann surface the riemann - roch theorem tells us that the dimensionality of the holomorphic @xmath39 forms is @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the genus of the surface and @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , on the riemann surface this quantity must be an integer .",
    "we expect this quantization to generalize to the possible noncommutative version of the riemann surface .",
    "further , requiring periodicity for transport along noncontractible loops fixes @xmath43 to be integer ( it can also be half - integer if we only require periodicity up to @xmath44 signs , giving rise to the `` spin structures '' of the half - forms , which are familiar from perturbative string theory ) .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are very natural for eigenvalue problems and we can choose to require it even for the @xmath0 surface ( which can be considered as a limiting case of a very large riemann surface ) .",
    "therefore we are led to consider the case of @xmath43 to be integer ( and hence we will restrict b to integer values ) and futher investigate the noncommutative version of this requirement .    in the language of group theory , considering",
    "@xmath43 integer means considering representations of the group @xmath2 , rather than just of its algebra , see ref.@xcite for an illuminating discussion .",
    "thus this requirement is immediatly transferred to the noncommutative case , where it implies requiring the quantum numbers labeling the representations to be integers ( or half - integers , if we allow for @xmath44 signs ) .",
    "we will contrast the relevance of the more general ( non integer ) representations of the algebra and the richer set of spectrum it gives with the restricted set applicable for riemann surfaces etc . in our analysis .",
    "this discrete part of the spectrum , which we will call landau levels , comprises the eigenvalues e_j = j(1-j ) , with @xmath45 up to the maximal @xmath46 , each having a degeneracy corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath47 , with @xmath20 any nonnegative integer .",
    "the corresponding wavefunctions are _",
    "l^(n ) & = & ( -(b/2 - 1)ln g_z|z ) ( -(b/2 - 2)ln g_z|z ) + & & ( -(b/2-l)ln g_z|z ) ( i+z)^2l_0^(n ) . besides the above discrete levels",
    ", there is a continuum spectrum with nonnegative values for @xmath48 .",
    "the above results can be cast in an algebraic form , by making use of the invariance group of @xmath0 , that is @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath0 manifold is conveniently described by embedding it in flat minkowski manifold with coordinates @xmath49 with the constraint : xx= x_1 ^ 2+x_2 ^ 2-x_3 ^ 2=-1 , [ xsq ] where we have defined @xmath50 for two vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    the @xmath2 generators @xmath53 satisfy the commutation relations : = -ij_3 .5truecm [ j_2,j_3]=ij_1 .5truecm [ j_3,j_1]=ij_2 , [ jcomm ] = -ix_3 .5truecm [ j_2,x_3]=ix_1 .5truecm [ j_3,x_1]=ix_2 .",
    "[ xcomm ] we are considering here the standard commuting operators for @xmath54 , therefore = 0 .",
    "the relation with the previous formalism in terms of operators in complex coordinates are : x_1=iz+|z z-|z .5truecm x_2=i1-z|z z-|z .5truecm x_3=i1+z|z z-|z , and j_1 & = & i(z+ |z | ) + j_3,2 & = & -i 2((1 z^2)+(1 |z^2)| b(z-|z ) ) .",
    "[ ji ]    we can verify that @xmath55 and that @xmath56 , therefore eq.([bound ] ) tells us that @xmath57 .    it is well known @xcite that the unitary representations of so(2,1 ) algebra are of two kinds : the discrete ones @xmath58 , in which @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 , ( but restricted to positive integer or half integer , if we look for representation of the group instead ) and @xmath20 nonnegative integer , and the continuum ones @xmath62 in which @xmath63 is real positive .    therefore we find that the landau levels , we have obtained correspond to @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    ".5 cm    note that if the surface is more in general described by the constraint @xmath66 ( previously @xmath67 ) , then the metric is @xmath68 and the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is now @xmath69 while @xmath70 .",
    "thus the discrete spectrum is @xmath71 , with the same @xmath45 as for @xmath67 .",
    "it is convenient to redefine the hamiltonian to be h_0=jj , [ hamiltonian0 ] for generic @xmath72 , keeping the same definition @xmath70 , so that the discrete spectrum is always @xmath73 . we will keep the hamiltonian of eq.([hamiltonian0 ] ) in the generalization to the noncommutative surface described in the next section",
    "in order to define the noncommutative @xmath0 , we introduce a set of noncommuting coordinates @xmath74 with the @xmath2 algebra as relevant noncommuting rules : = -ir_3 .5truecm [ r_2,r_3]=ir_1 .5truecm [ r_3,r_1]=ir_2 , [ rcomm ] = -ir_3 .5truecm [ j_2,r_3]=ir_1 .5truecm [ j_3,r_1]=ir_2 , [ jrcomm ] where the @xmath75 are the @xmath2 generators satisfying the algebra eq.([jcomm ] ) .",
    "now , instead of requiring @xmath76 which describes @xmath0 in the commutative case , we require a fixed negative value for the casimir @xmath77 . we know from the @xmath2 representation theory @xcite that such a negative casimir is of the form @xmath78 . of the two discrete representations",

    "this amounts to parameterize the magnetic field by the choice of @xmath91 .",
    "note that the approach of ref.@xcite is such that it allows a redefinition of the hamiltonian by an overall constant which can be positive or negative depending on the range of the parameters , in particular of the magnetic field .",
    "* 2 ) * alternatively we we may stick to the choice similar to the one in the commutative case , and use the commuting set of observables @xmath92 to keep fixed @xmath93 that is , like in the commutative case , we define and keep fixed @xmath94 .",
    "this , we consider , is more appropriate to our definition of the problem , in keeping with the hamiltonian of eq.([noncommham ] ) .    in this case",
    "the limit @xmath95 ( at fixed @xmath96 ) is expected to reproduce the physics of the landau levels on the commutative @xmath0 surface : in fact by defining @xmath97 we get approximate commuting coordinates .      following the discussion of the previous section",
    ", we may require the eigenvalue @xmath43 ( and also @xmath72 for consistency ) to be integer or half - integer .",
    "this will be probably relevant for the setting of the landau levels problem on a noncommutative riemann surface , which is still to come .",
    "since the derivation is essentially the same , we consider @xmath43 to be real as the general case .",
    "requiring integer or half - integer @xmath43 would simply imply to discard the levels in which @xmath43 is not so ; the allowed levels would be much sparser then in the real @xmath43 case , also depending on a fine tuning of the values of @xmath72 and @xmath96 .",
    "let us start with @xmath98 .",
    "since @xmath99 , the resulting spectrum of the hamiltonian is obtained from eq.([cp ] ) .",
    "we get a continuum nonnegative part of the spectrum @xmath62 and an unbounded discrete spectrum @xmath100 with @xmath59 , @xmath101 up to infinity ; therefore the hamiltonian ( [ noncommham ] ) is unbounded from below and above .      for @xmath103 ,",
