    "as the number of loops to which perturbative field theories are evaluated increases , the group structure of the individual diagrams becomes more and more complicated .",
    "this problem has been recognized many years ago and on a group - by - group basis some very compact algorithms were proposed  @xcite for their computation . especially for the defining and the adjoint representations of the classical groups",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 these algorithms can be implemented rather easily in a symbolic program that will then give the color trace of a diagram as a function of the parameter @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of these algorithms is however that these results give no information about group invariants and hence it is only possible for very simple diagrams to generalize the results such that they are valid for arbitrary groups and arbitrary representations .",
    "hence a different type of algorithm is needed , if one would like a more general answer . that such information is useful can be seen from some recent calculations in qcd @xcite",
    "in which the representation in terms of invariants could show immediately why extrapolations of lower orders in perturbation theory could not be successful .",
    "in addition the presentation in terms of group invariants is more general and needs hardly any new work when one needs to apply it for different groups or representations .",
    "the need for this kind of generality is clear , for example , from grand unification and string theory , where all semi - simple lie groups may occur .",
    "we consider non - abelian gauge theories based on simple compact lie groups .",
    "the extension to semi - simple algebras and additional @xmath7 factors is then straightforward .",
    "the gauge bosons are assumed to couple to matter in some irreducible representation @xmath8 of the gauge group .",
    "the generalization to reducible representations is also straightforward .",
    "the group - theoretical quantities that appear in the initial expressions are the structure constants @xmath9 ( appearing in gauge self - couplings and ghost couplings ) and the lie - algebra generators @xmath10 in the representation @xmath8 , appearing in the coupling of the gauge bosons to matter . in this paper",
    "we consider only  vacuum bubbles \" ,  diagrams without external lines .",
    "as far as the group theoretical factor is concerned , our results are relevant for any diagram whose external lines carry no gauge quantum number , or for the absolute value squared of any amplitude if one sums over the gauge quantum numbers of all external lines .",
    "the group theoretical factor of other diagrams can be obtained by multiplying the diagram by projection operators .",
    "the group theory factor of a vacuum bubble diagram consists of traces of a certain number of matrices @xmath11 , whose indices are fully contracted among each other and with some combination of structure constants .",
    "our goal is to obtain an expression for this factor that is minimally representation- or group - dependent . in principle , this goal can be achieved as follows .    1 .",
    "express the traces in terms of symmetrized traces .",
    "this can always be done at the expense of some additional factors @xmath9 + now one may simplify the resulting expression further by observing that the structure constants can be viewed as representation matrices in the adjoint representation .",
    "this allows us to 2 .",
    "eliminate all closed loops of structure constants @xmath9 .",
    "+ this amounts to performing step 1 . on traces of adjoint matrices @xmath12 .",
    "step 2 . can also be performed in an algorithmic way to arbitrary order .",
    "however , the algorithm is not identical to that of step 1 because of the special properties of the adjoint representation .",
    "3 .   express the symmetrized traces in terms of a standard basis of symmetric invariant tensors .",
    "a lie algebra of rank @xmath13 has precisely @xmath13 such tensors @xcite .",
    "+ at this point we have succeeded in expressing every group theory factor in terms of @xmath14 representation - independent quantities , namely the symmetric tensors and @xmath9 .",
    "the representation dependence is encapsulated in terms of ( generalized ) indices @xcite .",
    "we show how these indices can be computed for any representation of any lie - algebra to any desired order .",
    "this algorithm requires a convenient choice for the basis of tensors , which is _ not _ the mathematically more elegant  orthogonal \" basis advocated in @xcite .",
    "the result is also to a reasonable extent group - independent .",
    "the only way group - dependence enters is trough the ( non)-existence of certain invariant tensors , but one may simply take all possible tensors into account , and only eliminate them at the end .",
    "the only problem is that the group @xmath15 has _ two _ distinct tensors of rank @xmath16 .",
    "this case can rather easily be dealt with explicitly .",
    "+ although our main goal has now been achieved , the result is expressed in terms of many combinations of symmetric tensors and structure constants that are not all independent .",
    "unfortunately there do not seem to exist many mathematical results regarding these invariants .",
    "in particular , we are not aware of any theorem regarding the minimal number of invariant combinations . for this reason",
    "the rest of our program is limited to finite orders , and is not guaranteed to yield the optimal answer in all cases .",
    "as a first step we 4 .",
    "eliminate as much as possible the remaining structure constants @xmath9 .",
    "+ we do not know of a proof that this is always possible , and in fact we have only been able to do this explicitly up to a certain order .",
    "the first object where we were unable to perform step 4 is built out of two structure constants and three rank 4 symmetric tensors .",
    "if step 4 is completed , one is left with a fully contracted combination of symmetric invariant tensors .",
    "we derive formulas expressing many such contractions in terms of a few basic ones .",
    "+ the last step is essentially group dependent ( and therefore somewhat outside our main interest ) : 6 .",
    "compute a formula for the basic invariants for each group . + here ",
    "basic invariant \" is any of the contracted combinations of symmetric tensors that could not be expressed in terms of others , and any combination involving additional structure constants that could not be eliminated .",
    "none of these steps is new in itself , but we believe that in all cases we are going considerably beyond previous results ( see _ e.g _ [ 7 - 25 ] ) . since the application we have in mind is to feynman diagrams , it is essential not just to develop an algorithm , but also to make sure it can be carried out efficiently .",
    "complicated group theory factors appear only at higher orders in perturbation theory , which implies that one must be able to deal with a very large number of diagrams .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we give some definitions and conventions , and present some well - known general results on invariant tensors . in section 3",
    "we present the algorithm to perform step 1 .",
    "although this is in principle straightforward , without proper care such an algorithm may quickly get out of control .",
    "the same is true for step 2 , which is presented in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we present the character method for computing indices and symmetrized traces .",
    "this section is based on results presented in @xcite and @xcite , the main novelty being the extension to all higher indices of exceptional algebras . in section 6",
    "we discuss steps 4 and 5 .",
    "section 7 contains some remarks regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the two basis choices for the symmetric tensors .    in appendix",
    "a we present explicit results for indices and trace identities of the exceptional algebras ; appendix b contains a description of the computer methods used , and in appendix c we give a few examples to demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm .",

    "we would like to express all traces in terms of a minimal set of invariant tensors . as a first step one may use the commutation relations to express the trace in a completely symmetric trace plus terms of lower order in the generators , which in their turn can also be expressed in terms of symmetrized traces .",
    "an efficient algorithm for doing this will be discussed in the next section . after this step we only need to consider symmetrized traces @xmath48 where the sum is over all permutations of the indices ( the cyclic permutation may of course be factored out using the cyclic property of the trace ) .    for each representation one may define a symmetric invariant tensor @xmath49 with @xmath50 but",
    "this still vastly overparametrizes the problem , because a new tensor is defined for every order @xmath51 and for every representation @xmath8 .",
    "it is well - known that the number of independent symmetric invariant tensors is equal to the rank of the algebra .",

    "this is true because the polynomial is invariant under @xmath59 and it is well - known that for every @xmath54 one can find a transformation @xmath37 that rotates @xmath54 into the cartan subalgebra .",
    "hence @xmath55 depends only on as many parameters as the dimension of the cartan subalgebra ,  @xmath13 .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that any such polynomial can be expressed in terms of @xmath13 basic ones , although the precise details (  the orders of the basic polynomials ) do nt follow from this simple argument .",
    "the orders of the basic polynomials for each group are known @xcite , and are given in the following table ( for future purposes this table also gives the  dual coxeter number \" @xmath60 ) .",
    ".[tab : itr ] _ ranks of basic invariant tensors _ [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath61 we also have to consider the invariants with 5 indices .",
    "these we can obtain with the reference representation @xmath13 . for invariants that involve this representation we have : @xmath62 a number of these quantities can be obtained in various ways and serve as a check of our programs .",
    "the algebra @xmath64 has an index of order @xmath65 that vanishes for the vector representation , and is non - zero only for chiral representations .",
    "the latter are characterized by having unequal values for the last two dynkin labels , @xmath66 .",
    "the simplest representations of this type are the spinors , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath65 is odd @xmath69 is the complex conjugate of @xmath70 .",
    "note that for odd @xmath65 the extra index ( henceforth referred to as the  chiral index \" ) has odd order , unlike all other @xmath4 indices , whereas for @xmath65 even there are two distinct indices of even order , namely the chiral index and one of the regular indices .    since the chiral index vanishes for the vector representation , whereas all indices are non - zero for the spinor , it might be argued that the latter is perhaps a more suitable choice for the reference representation .",
    "however , the vector representation has other advantages , perhaps most importantly that the trace - identities for traces of order larger than @xmath71 are simpler .",
