    "cp violation is one of the most intriguing puzzles in particle physics and a lot of work has been devoted to the search of its origin .",
    "the most accepted way to generate cp violation in the standard model ( sm ) is through the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) phase @xcite .",
    "this way has demonstrated to be very accurate at describing the phenomenology of the neutral kaon system @xcite . however , there are other ways which can give account of the cp violation effects on the neutral kaon system while exhibiting new interesting features . one of these ways consists of searching for a natural origin of the cp violating phase , for example , through complex vacuum expectation values .",
    "this can be achieved in the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite where there is one _ genuine _ complex vacuum expectation value due to the presence of a scalar bidoublet , and that is responsible for the quark sector cp violating phase .",
    "there is also another genuine complex vacuum expectation value due to the presence of two scalar triplets that , together with the scalar bidoublet vacuum expectation value , are the responsible for the cp violation in the lepton sector .",
    "the main advantages of this model is that it explains both parity and cp as spontaneously broken symmetries , and identifies the hypercharge with the quantum number giving it thus a physical meaning .",
    "another property of this model is that it offers an explanation for the smallness of the neutrino masses , through the see - saw mechanism @xcite , as well as a framework for the study of cp violation in the lepton sector , which is not present in the sm and that is source of lots of present experimental and theoretical works @xcite .",
    "as the sm explains successfully the effects of cp violation on the neutral kaon system , we expect that it can explain these effects on the b systems too .",
    "the dilepton asymmetry @xmath3 / [ n\\left ( l^{+}l^{+}\\right ) + n\\left ( l^{-}l^{-}\\right ) ] $ ] relates directly to the parameter of indirect cp violation @xmath4 .",
    "the most recent measurement , made with dilepton events , shows that @xmath5 , for the @xmath6 system , lies in the range @xcite @xmath7 which has a central value different to zero but with a too long width , measured by the babar collaboration from the fully reconstruction of a @xmath8 resonance decay @xcite , shows to have a much more narrow experimental width @xmath9 .",
    "this is a good quantity to compare with the theoretical predictions but , unfortunately , it just gives information about the magnitude of @xmath4 leaving its argument unknown . ] .",
    "then , it is possible to have many different models which explain correctly the effects of cp violation on the neutral kaon system , giving a value for @xmath10 compatible with the experimental width but , in principle , different to the sm one .",
    "many of these models are also able to give some insight in the understanding of cp violation in the lepton sector . among these models of new physics",
    "is the lrsm .",
    "several authors have studied the predictions that the lrsm makes for the cp violation phenomena in the neutral b systems @xcite , and have found interesting deviations from the sm predictions which could be tested in accelerator experiments .",
    "what they do is to assume an order of magnitude of @xmath1 tev for the right scale @xmath0 of the model so that the new physics contributions are comparable with the usual sm ones .",
    "it is a nice feature to obtain comparable contributions since we can learn a lot about the underlying structure of the model by means of the comparison of the theoretical predictions and the experimental data . however ,",
    "if we want to consider seriously the predictions of this scenario , we should ask ourselves where the order of magnitude comes from .",
    "the main goal of this article is to study the predictions of the lrsm about the parameter @xmath10 for both the @xmath6 and @xmath11 systems , by means of the calculation of the dilepton asymmetry @xmath12 , and to compare them to both the predictions of the sm and the experimental results although it just gives a piece of information : the magnitude of @xmath4 .",
    "this is however helpful because of the experimental precision level reached in the measurement of @xmath13 . ] . unlike the other works mentioned before @xcite",
    ", we stick to the more conservative order of magnitude for the right scale @xmath14 gev which arises when the neutrino masses generation from the see - saw mechanism is considered @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the new physics sector of the lrsm decouples from the quark sector and , therefore , the new physics effects involving interactions with quarks are negligible .",
    "so , both the sm and the lrsm predict the same value for the parameter @xmath15 ( and consequently for @xmath16 ) in the @xmath17 systems .",
    "this scenario becomes not so interesting as the expected new physics effects , useful to go deep into the structure of the model , do not appear .",
    "nevertheless we think it is important to describe it for the sake of completeness , and to avoid enlarging even more the original lrsm .",
    "the latter would be required to lower the right scale without violating the constraints coming from the neutrino masses generation .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in the section 2 we study the phenomenology of cp violation for the neutral b systems . in the section 3",
    "we describe the lrsm and the see - saw mechanism that provides masses to the neutrino sector .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath16 for the @xmath17 systems are calculated in the section 4 in the frameworks of both the sm and the lrsm .",
    "we compare their predictions to the experimental data .",
    "the conclusions are presented in the section 5 .",
    "there are two kinds of neutral b mesons : @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which we can write as linear combinations of cp eigenstates and that at the same time are linear combinations of the flavor eigenstates @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the cp eigenstates , even and odd respectively : @xmath25 we can see that @xmath26 is almost the cp - even state @xmath23 with a tiny admixture of the cp - odd state @xmath24 , and that @xmath27 is almost the cp - odd state @xmath24 with a tiny admixture of the cp - even state @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 represents the measure of the cp violation in the `` mixed state '' .",
    "the two states @xmath26 and @xmath27 have their own proper mass and lifetime @xcite .",
    "one of the possible products in a @xmath29 collision is a pair @xmath30 .",
    "working in the basis of flavor eigenstates , we can determine the evolution of this pair : @xmath31 with @xmath32 \\pm \\exp \\left [ -i\\left ( m_h- \\frac i2\\gamma _ h\\right ) t\\right ] \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mass and the inverse of the lifetime of @xmath35 .",
    "for an event where both @xmath36 mesons undergo semileptonic decay , we can define a charge asymmetry of such events as @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 indicates the number of pairs @xmath39 produced in the decay .",
    "the numbers of leptonic pairs @xmath40 and @xmath41 are related to @xmath28 by : @xmath42 thus : @xmath43    according to the last result , a dilepton asymmetry is directly related to a non vanishing value of @xmath28 which measure the amount of indirect cp violation .",
    "this result is model independent and , therefore , it entitles us to calculate the dilepton asymmetry @xmath12 via the calculation of the parameter @xmath28 for any kind of particle model .",
    "the lrsm is based on the group of symmetries @xmath44 which assures both parity and cp conservation . according to this ,",
    "it is possible to assign leptons and quarks the following quantum numbers : @xmath45 where the @xmath46 generator corresponds to the @xmath47 quantum number of the multiplet @xcite .",
    "the gauge bosons consist of two triplets : @xmath48 and one singlet : @xmath49    due to the existence of a discrete parity symmetry , the model must be invariant under the transformations : @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and .    to break the symmetry , and give masses to bosons and fermions , it is necessary to introduce a bidoublet @xmath52 and two scalar triplets @xmath53 and",
