    "by scanning the galactic plane with an x - ray payload on a sounding rocket , @xcite discovered an unusual x - ray source in the constellation scutum , which they named ( hereafter sct  x-1 ) .",
    "sct  x-1  was subsequently detected using x - ray instruments on the _ copernicus _ , _ ariel v _",
    ", _ heao 1 _ , and _ ginga_satellites ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ; in contrast , it was not detected , at least unambiguously , in surveys done using the _ uhuru _ and _ exosat _ satellites ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* fourth uhuru catalog ) . in summary ,",
    "these observations determined that ( i ) the x - ray flux varies over a range as wide as @xmath5  mcrab to 20  mcrab , and this variability occurs on a variety of timescales @xcite ; ( ii ) the emission has a hard spectrum with a significant low - energy cutoff that implies an interstellar absorption column density of @xmath6 ; ( iii ) the source is an x - ray pulsar with a 111-s pulsation period @xcite ; and ( iv ) the x - ray spectrum may show line emission at 6.4  kev , presumably from iron k fluorescence @xcite . based on its similarity to other sources at the same galactic longitude , @xcite concluded that sct  x-1  is likely an x - ray binary in the scutum arm of the galaxy at about 10  kpc distance .    the most accurate information on the celestial location of sct  x-1  comes from @xcite , who presented positions of x - ray sources measured with the modulation collimator ( mc ) on the _ heao 1 _  satellite ( _ heao 1_a3 ) .",
    "they derived a grid of diamond - shaped error boxes , but concluded that only two of the diamonds were consistent with earlier observations @xcite , viz .",
    ", those centered at @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 ( both b1950 ; the corresponding j2000 positions are @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) .",
    "each error diamond was approximately @xmath15 in right ascension by @xmath16 in declination .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our analysis of archival x - ray observations of sct  x-1  with _ asca _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ rxte _ ) .",
    "their conclusions are largely the same as our own . ] .",
    "we find that the source is _ not _ in either of the two error boxes chosen by @xcite , but is instead in the next box to the west .",
    "the presence of a 112-s period pulsation ( having evolved from the 111-s period that was found previously ) and the coincidence in position with one of the _ heao 1 _  error boxes make us confident of our identification .",
    "we describe the x - ray analysis in   [ sec : xray ] , and identify a near - ir counterpart from the two - micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) and mid - ir surveys in ",
    "[ sec : ir ] . finally , we give our discussion in   [ sec : disc ] and conclusions in   [ sec : conc ] .",
    "we found that the x - ray source , discovered by @xcite in their survey of the galactic plane with _",
    "asca _  ( this specific observation is from 1997  october  13 ) , was close to but not consistent with the published positions of sct  x-1  @xcite .",
    "however , there were too few counts in the _ asca _  data to perform a reasonably sensitive search for periodicities and thereby uniquely identify ax  j183528@xmath00737 : @xcite measured a 0.77  kev count rate of @xmath17 in an observation with 4  ksec of good exposure , so there are only @xmath18 counts ( summed over the two gis detectors ) .",
    "a 17-ks _ xmm - newton _  observation of ax  j183528@xmath00737  ( observation 0203850201 ) was performed on 2004  september  18/mjd  53266.26 .",
    "there is one bright source detected in the epic - pn and epic - mos images ( the source is not detected in the rgs data ) .",
    "this source , which is located at ( j2000 ) @xmath19 , @xmath20 with statistical position uncertainties of @xmath21 ( and absolute uncertainties of @xmath22 ) , is fully consistent with the position of ax  j183528@xmath00737  ( see fig .  [",

    "it has a background - subtracted epic - pn count rate of @xmath23 in the 0.58  kev band , and is consistent with a point source given the angular resolution of _ xmm - newton_. figure  [ fig : image ] also shows that the positions of ax  j183528@xmath00737  determined from both the _ asca _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations are fully consistent with one of the error boxes of sct  x-1  that was derived from the much earlier _ heao 1 _  observations although it does not happen to be one of the two error boxes selected as prime candidates for the source location by @xcite .",

    "no other strong peaks were found in the epic - pn or mos1 spectra , while in the mos2 spectrum there is a peak at a period of 100.6  s which reaches a power about @xmath32 that of the peak at @xmath33  s. however , given the much lower amplitude of the main mos2 peak ( 23.6 , compared to 93.6 for the pn ) the secondary peak is not very strong overall ( single trial probability of @xmath34 ) . based on this , we conclude that a @xmath35  s pulse period was detected , and that the 100.6  s period is likely either a noise spike or an instrumental effect in the mos2 data .",
    "folding the data on the 112-s period , we see ( fig .  [ fig : pulse ] ) strong , asymmetric pulsations with a pronounced interpulse , not unlike the pulse profiles shown in @xcite .",
    "the pn data have an rms pulsed fraction of 29% .",
    "to examine the variability of the x - ray source during the _ xmm - newton _  exposure and to search for background flares , we binned the epic event data in 200-s bins to construct lightcurves , which we show in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "in all three epic detectors the background is high with episodes of strong flaring for the first @xmath36 of the observation .",
    "this flaring is likely responsible ( through telemetry saturation ) for the dips in the source lightcurves at @xmath37  s , as the unfiltered epic - pn count rate exceeds the limit of @xmath38 and therefore the cameras entered `` counting mode '' ( note that excluding the saturated regions has no effect on the period determination ) .",
    "however , even away from the times of strong flaring in the background , the source strength appears to vary by a factor of @xmath39 ; see the small increases near 9000  s and especially the variations in count rate after the background dies out near 11000  s. these variations are similar to those seen by @xcite .",

    "we have not attempted to determine the luminosity class of sct  x-1 , as the detailed measurements necessary for that are beyond the tolerance of our calibration , although the strength of the co bands argues for luminosity class i  iii ( see @xcite ) .    for comparison , in figure  [ fig : irspec ]",

    "in the @xmath97-band the match is not as good , with some curvature present in the nirspec data from poor calibration , but the absorption features and the overall depth of the co bands agree reasonably well .",

    "[ fig : image ] ; it is also more or less consistent with the other x - ray positions ) , secures the identification of ax  j183528@xmath00737  with sct  x-1 .",
    "we now discuss the implications of our measurements in more detail .      comparing the spin periods that we measure here to the values measured by @xcite with the _ ginga _ satellite ( table  [ tab : per ] ) , we see evidence for secular spin - down over 17 years .",
    "@xcite inferred a spin - down rate of @xmath104 , although this was only based on two measurements and could not account for possible torque variations or periodic ( i.e.  orbital ) changes .",
    "our period measurement fits this trend reasonably well ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pdot ] ) : a weighted fit ( which is dominated by the _ ginga _ measurements ) gives @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "so it appears that the spin - down has largely been steady , averaged over 17  years , although there certainly could have been some small - scale torque variations visible in the departure of the _ rxte _  period measurements from the long - term trend .",
    "this excludes the possibility that the period change in sct  x-1  was due to orbital motion as considered by @xcite , as no companion can produce a doppler shift of 2  s over 17  yrs , and instead suggests that the spin - down is due to external torques .",
    "overall , this scenario agrees with the conclusion of @xcite that the compact object in sct  x-1  is a neutron star rather than a white dwarf ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which would need a much larger torque than those that have been observed to produce the measured @xmath107 .      even if we ignore the presence or absence of the fe line , our best - fit spectral parameters are not the same as those estimated by @xcite , who found a slightly softer power - law ( @xmath108 vs.  @xmath109 here ) and more absorption ( @xmath110 vs.  @xmath111 here ) .",
    "in fact , most of the x - ray observations to date ( which have not been of the same quality as the _ xmm - newton _  observation ) have inferred column densities above @xmath112 .",
    "while this could just be an effect of instrumental cross - calibration and inconsistent fitting techniques , the difference is quite large .",
    "this could be due to variations in absorption by matter associated with the sct  x-1  system over the @xmath113  yrs between the observations ( see @xcite ) ; in particular , variations in @xmath43 are often associated with absorption from a variable stellar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a decrease in @xmath43 can even be correlated with a decrease in the fe equivalent width .",
    "overall , the flux has decreased by about a factor of 4 from the _ ginga _ observations to the _ xmm - newton _  observations ( we find a flux of @xmath114  mcrab ) , and the variability of the pulsed amplitude during the _ rxte _",
    "observations over the course of several months ( tab .",
    "[ tab : xte ] ) may be as much as a factor of 10 .",
    "the unabsorbed flux in the _ xmm - newton _  observations implies a luminosity @xmath115 in the 0.510  kev band , where the distance to sct  x-1  is @xmath116 kiloparsecs .",
    "the very red colors of 2mass  j18352582@xmath00736501  imply a large extinction , as no stars have intrinsic colors nearly that red .",
    "the reddest main - sequence star listed in @xcite has @xmath117 ( m5v ) , while the reddest giant star has @xmath118 ( m5iii ) . if we assume intrinsic colors of @xmath119 for 2mass  j18352582@xmath00736501  and that the emission we see is photospheric ( no excess from a disk or wind ) , this then implies @xmath120 ( hence the giant track shown in figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "such extinction makes 2mass  j18352582@xmath00736501  very faint in the optical , which is consistent with our measured @xmath85 magnitude and with the upper limits at @xmath84 and in other bluer bands .",
    "this extinction agrees with the slope of the @xmath81-band continuum , although given our calibration uncertainties that is not a strong statement .",
    "the x - ray absorption implied by this extinction , using the relation of @xcite , is @xmath121 , which is consistent with our spectroscopic result .",
    "the galactic extinction model of @xcite predicts that @xmath122 at 7.5  kpc , and @xmath123 at 10  kpc , although at these distances and extinctions , the model is not very well constrained .",
    "so based on extinction alone , and assuming that the extinction is extrinsic to the sources , we would estimate a distance of @xmath124  kpc for sct  x-1 , which is consistent with the assertion of @xcite , that sct  x-1  is likely in a spiral arm at @xmath125  kpc .",
    "however , while we know that 2mass  j18352582@xmath00736501  is heavily reddened , with the limited data that we have it is difficult to determine its intrinsic colors and stellar type with any precision .",
    "a rough fit to the @xmath126 photometry ( and the @xmath75 upper limit ) is reasonably consistent with a late - type star at @xmath127 .",
    "this inference is consistent with what we deduce from the near - ir spectroscopy . in general , for a given stellar type the distance to 2mass  j18352582@xmath00736501  is @xmath128 - 2,\\ ] ] where @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the color and absolute magnitude of the star , which we take from @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath133 by @xmath134 where we observe @xmath135 , @xmath136 is the intrinsic color of the star , and @xmath137 .",
    "if we take 2mass  j18352582@xmath00736501  to be a late - type supergiant , we have ( for m0i ) @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , so we find a distance of @xmath141  kpc .",
    "this is slightly smaller than that implied by the extinction , but gives a reasonable x - ray luminosity of @xmath142 .      given its infrared and x - ray characteristics , sct  x-1  resembles the 2-minute x - ray pulsar gx  1 + 4 , which is a symbiotic system with an m - giant mass donor ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "gx  1 + 4 generally is quite similar to sct  x-1 : it has a similar spin - period and showed a prolonged period of relatively faint ( @xmath1432  mcrab ) emission with steady spin - down @xcite , although it had previous bright periods associated with spin - up .",
    "we note , though , that we did not see the strong emission lines one would expect from a symbiotic star ( fig .  [",
    "fig : irspec ] ) , but this may be a result of variability or viewing geometry ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that gx  1 + 4 appears somewhat less luminous in the near - ir : gx  1 + 4 has @xmath144 with @xmath145 , which imply @xmath146 or @xmath147 @xcite .",
    "if the sct  x-1  system contains a star like this it would only be 500  pc distant ; the observed extinction in the optical / near - ir and low energy x - ray absorption would be hard to explain , and the x - ray luminosity would be very low .",
    "it is possible that sct  x-1  is a nearby low - mass x - ray binary with an evolved giant companion .",
    "this would then imply a low x - ray luminosity  comparable to those implied by @xcite  and that the x - ray and optical / ir absorption are intrinsic to the source , perhaps caused by material in the stellar wind ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this would be consistent with the possible variations in @xmath43 seen between our _ xmm - newton _  data and previous observations , but those variations are far from robustly determined .",
    "additionally , the reasonable agreement between the x - ray and optical / ir column densities ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the absorbing material is largely distributed along the line of sight .",
    "we therefore believe it very likely that sct  x-1   is an x - ray binary with a giant or supergiant late - type companion located at a distance of @xmath148  kpc . in this case , the mass donor in sct  x-1  would be larger than several hundred @xmath149 ( the companion to gx  1 + 4 has a radius @xmath150 ) and significantly more massive than in the previous scenario ( i.e. , a supergiant of @xmath151 rather than an evolved giant of 12@xmath152 )",
    ". with such a large companion , even at a distance of 10  kpc the x - ray luminosity would be very low for steady roche - lobe overflow accretion , so therefore the accretion must be either wind - fed or in an elliptical orbit . with either companion ( a giant or supergiant ) ,",
    "if we assume that the accretion is wind - fed , we can set a lower limit in the orbital period @xmath153 .",
    "for a circular orbit and m0i star ( with stellar radius @xmath154 and mass @xmath155 ) , we would need @xmath156  yr so that it was contained within its roche lobe , while a star like the companion to gx  1 + 4 ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) would have @xmath159  yr . with a large companion ,",
    "sct  x-1  is a good candidate for an eclipsing system since the companion will occult the neutron star with a significant probability @xcite , and such eclipsing systems offer valuable constraints on the neutron star mass distribution @xcite .",
    "further x - ray observations to measure the orbit of sct  x-1  and fully study the spectrum , along with optical / ir observations to determine the parameters of 2mass  j18352582@xmath00736501 , should be quite valuable in unraveling the nature of the system .",
