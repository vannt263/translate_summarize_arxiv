    "the ab - initio determination of hadronic properties is an important task of lattice qcd calculations . following the impressive progress in the determination of the hadron mass spectrum , one went on to more advanced calculations , such as the determination of matrix elements .",
    "an important example is the electromagnetic pion form factor @xcite",
    ".    with the successful implementation of chiral symmetry , based on the ginsparg - wilson ( gw ) relation @xcite , also results at smaller quark masses are feasible .",
    "in addition to an exact implementation @xcite , further dirac operators have been suggested that fulfill the gw condition in an approximate way , among them the domain - wall fermions @xcite , the perfect fermions @xcite and the chirally improved ( ci ) fermions @xcite .",
    "dynamical calculations at small quark masses are certainly the ultimate goal .",
    "currently such calculations are still prohibitively expensive but one can try to improve in two ways : either one works with dynamical fermions in a conventional formulation or one tries to approach smaller quark masses with gw type operators in the quenched approximation . in our present contribution",
    "we focus on the latter .",
    "we present here a first - principles calculation for off - forward lattice matrix elements of operators that measure the vector and scalar form factors of the pion .",
    "we work with the ci fermions , which constitute an approximate solution of the ginsparg - wilson relation and thus have improved chiral properties @xcite . in our calculation",
    "we consider comparatively low pion masses down to 340 mev , which is likely in the domain where chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) can be applied .",
    "another convenient feature of chirally improved fermions is that the renormalization of the local current @xmath0 is quite close to 1 @xcite .",
    "preliminary results of our calculations have been presented in ref .",
    "the quenched results for the vector form factor at the available transferred momenta lie close to the experimental curves . from our data for the form factors",
    "we can derive the charge radius of the pion as well as its scalar radius .",
    "the former comes out smaller than experiment , due to the too large value of the @xmath1-meson mass .",
    "the scalar radius appears to be sensitive to quenching and possibly to the contributions of the disconnected diagrams , which we do not include in our calculations .",
    "the pion form factor in the quenched approximation has been studied for wilson type fermions @xcite , for gw type fermions @xcite and for twisted mass fermions @xcite .",
    "there are few results for dynamical fermions : for wilson - type fermions in refs .",
    "@xcite , and a study with domain - wall valence quarks and dynamical ( milc ) asqtad fermions @xcite ( and further references therein ) .",
    "the vector form factor @xmath2 is defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the space - like invariant momentum transfer squared , and @xmath5 is the vector current .",
    "the pion vector form factor is an analytic function of @xmath6 .",
    "its space - like values are determined from the values on the boundary of its analyticity domain , i.e. , the cut along the positive real @xmath6-axis .",
    "although it starts at @xmath7 , significant contributions only come from the hadronic region , starting with the two - pion threshold at @xmath8 . along the first part of the cut , until inelastic channels become important , due to unitarity the phase shift is essentially the p wave phase shift of the elastic two - pion channel .",
    "that region is dominated by the @xmath1-meson resonance .",
    "this feature has been exploited by various dispersion relation representations @xcite .",
    "although there are further inelastic contributions from the four - pion channel , these remain tiny until the @xmath9 channel opens .",
    "there is also a small contribution from the isoscalar @xmath10 , coupling through higher - order electromagnetic interactions .",
    "all these contributions show small effects on the near space - like region and can be safely neglected within the accuracy attained in our work .",
    "the dominant contribution of the vector meson resonances has inspired the vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model , where the form factor in the space - like domain is approximated by a sum of poles in the time - like region , @xmath11 in first approximation the coefficients are related to the coupling @xmath12 of the vector meson to the two - pion state and its coupling to the photon , @xmath13 .    in qcd the large @xmath14 behavior in leading order @xcite",
    "is given by @xmath15 with @xmath16 the running coupling constant ( logarithmic in the argument ) and @xmath17 the pion decay constant .",
    "in the @xmath14-region accessible to us the logarithm is not identifiable and the vmd behavior provides a good approximation .    due to electric charge conservation",
    "one has @xmath18 .",
    "the mean charge radius squared is defined through @xmath19 the current pdg average for its value is @xmath20 @xcite .    in the simplest vmd model with just the leading @xmath1-resonance one",
    "has ( due to normalization ) @xmath21 and @xmath22    the scalar form factor @xmath23 is given by the matrix element of the scalar operator , i.e. , @xmath24 within chiral perturbation theory the scalar form factor at @xmath25 is the so - called sigma term which behaves like @xmath26 near zero momentum transfer .",
    "the scalar radius squared @xmath27 can be obtained from @xmath28 for a detailed discussion of chiral perturbation theory in this context see @xcite .    )",
    "in order to compute the form factors , we need to evaluate off - forward matrix elements ( at several transferred momenta ) , i.e. , the expectation values of @xmath29 \\ ; , \\label{eq : matele}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the quark propagator from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and @xmath33 denotes the operator inserted at @xmath32 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath34 , @xmath35 and denote the momentum transfer as @xmath36 ( cf .",
    "[ fig_matele ] ) .",
    "the necessary matrix elements have been evaluated by using the sequential source method .",
    "the matrix element is then written as @xmath37 \\;.\\ ] ] the sequential propagator is defined as @xmath38 and can be easily computed by an additional inversion of the dirac operator @xmath39 for each choice of the final momentum @xmath40 , @xmath41 changing the properties of the sink requires the computation of new sequential propagators , and so simulating several final momenta , different field interpolators , or a different smearing for the sink rapidly becomes rather expensive . for this reason",
    "we have limited ourselves to only one value of the final momentum .",
    "an alternative version of the sequential source method , which builds the sequential propagator from the two propagators that sandwich the operator , would allow more values of the final momentum for free , but on the other hand it would require a new inversion of the dirac operator for every new type of operator and for each different value of the momentum transfer .",
    "this is much less convenient in our situation because we consider both the vector and scalar currents and want to obtain the corresponding form factors for several values of the momentum transfer .",
    "we extract the physical matrix elements by computing ratios of 3-point and 2-point correlators :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is our pseudoscalar interpolator .",
    "we keep the sink fixed at time @xmath6 and vary the timeslice @xmath44 where the operator @xmath33 sits ( scanning a range of timeslices ) .",
    "the ratio ( [ eqcorr ] ) eliminates the exponential factors in the time variable which are present if one considers @xmath45 alone . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath46 exhibits two plateaus in @xmath44 : @xmath47 and @xmath48 . in the case in which the sink is put at @xmath49",
    "the ratio is antisymmetric in @xmath50 .    in the monte carlo simulations",
    "the momentum projections of the sink onto non - zero @xmath40 and the operator onto non - zero momentum transfer @xmath51 lead to significant statistical fluctuations due to the worse signal - to noise ratio .",
    "in particular , for many configurations the 2-point correlators become negative on timeslices near the symmetry point @xmath49 .",
    "a reasonable way out of this inconvenient situation is to choose the sink to sit at a timeslice smaller than @xmath52 , because in this region the 2-point correlators have much larger values , and moreover their relative errors are smaller . we have thus put the sink at timeslice @xmath53 , while the source remained at timeslice @xmath54 .",
    "the matrix elements are finally determined ( as in the case @xmath49 ) by combining the two plateau values on either side of the sink , @xmath55 , where the relative sign depends on the parity properties of the operators .",
    "this sign is negative for the vector and positive for the scalar form factor .",
    "the term under the square root in eq .",
    "( [ eqcorr ] ) becomes trivial for @xmath56 . in that case",
    "the ratio becomes @xmath57 and is sufficient to eliminate the exponentials .",
    ".values of the non - zero momentum transfers . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the scalar form factor also has disconnected contributions which we disregard here ( like it is often done due to the inherent technical complications of backtracking loops ) .",
    "we can notice from the upper plots in fig .",
    "[ fig_rat_scal ] and the upper line in table [ tab : fpi_scal ] that the scalar form factor at zero momentum transfer divided by the quark mass has nearly the same value for all masses that we have simulated .",
    "this means that @xmath58 , as expected .",
    "we may determine the scalar radius squared from a fit to the @xmath14-dependence of the scalar form factor ( now explicitly normalized according to eq .",
    "( [ defscalarradius ] ) ) .    in analogy to the vector form factor",
    "we expect that the scalar form factor in the space - like region is a decreasing but positive definite function .",
    "thus a linear fit to its inverse seems appropriate .",
    "however , the result for the scalar radius squared is quite sensitive to this assumption . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pionscalarradius ] we compare the results of such a fit with those from a direct linear fit to our data in the space - like region and find a difference of almost 50% . in either case , the resulting value may then be extrapolated to the chiral limit .",
    "chpt relates the pion decay constant to the scalar form factor radius via @xmath59 with @xmath60 the chiral expansion of the pion decay constant should behave like @xcite @xmath61 where the value @xmath62 depends on the intrinsic qcd scale @xmath63 and in @xcite it is suggested to use @xmath64 ; in ref.@xcite a value of @xmath65 is quoted .",
    "( [ eq : chptfpiscalrradius ] ) may be translated to @xmath66 recent values quoted in that context are @xmath67 @xcite or @xmath68 @xcite .    in qcd one",
    "expects correction terms with a logarithmic singularity in the valence quark mass @xmath69 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the leading order logarithmic term @xmath70 of chpt involves quark loops that are however absent in the quenched case .",
    "there will be non - leading logarithmic terms , though .",
    "one therefore could allow a term @xmath71 in the extrapolating fit . in the range of mass values studied here ,",
    "the statistical accuracy of the data is too poor to render such an extrapolation significant .",
    "we therefore exhibit only the results of a constant extrapolation .",

    "lower plot : determination from the linear fit to the inverse of that ratio.,title=\"fig:\",height=188 ]    the resulting values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pionscalarradius ] ) are almost an order of magnitude smaller than for the electromagnetic case . from the data in table [ tab : fpi_scal ] , which takes into account the renormalization of the scalar operator , @xmath73 , as well as the kinematical factors , we obtain an average for the scalar radius of @xmath74 ( based on the linear fit to the inverse form factor ) .",
    "this is also smaller than the values expected for full qcd .",
    "results for the pion decay constant in a recent full qcd lattice calculation @xcite via ( [ eq : chptfpiscalrradius ] ) lead to the value @xmath75 .",
    "a corresponding analysis of the quenched bgr data @xcite gives again a small value , @xmath76 .",
    "this seems to imply that @xmath27 is very sensitive to quenching and possibly to the omission of the disconnected pieces .    a recent unquenched computation with @xmath77 clover fermions @xcite , which uses matrix elements of the scalar current and not the pion decay constant , quotes a larger value for the scalar radius squared , @xmath78",
    "however , this number results from a chpt - motivated extrapolation to data that is actually of smaller size and for pion masses @xmath79 550 mev .",
    "chirally improved fermions provide a framework for a first - principles lattice study of the hadron structure at comparatively small pion masses . in that context",
    "we present here our investigation of the vector and scalar form factors of the pion .",
    "we combine the method of @xcite ( which for the vector form factor avoids calculation of the pion energy and thus removes one source of statistical error ) with a gw type action , that allows one to reach small pion masses for comparatively small lattice size .",
    "the vector form factor describes the electromagnetic structure and our results are generally consistent with expectations of its general form . in view of the quenched approximation",
    "we expect deviations from the experimental numbers .",
    "the vector charge radius indeed comes out 40% smaller than in experiment and the scalar radius is much lower than one would expect from unquenched calculations .",
    "further progress could be achieved - as usual - by using better statistics , more momenta , and larger lattices , both in lattice units ( to study finite volume effects ) and in physical units ( to access lower transferred momenta ) .",
