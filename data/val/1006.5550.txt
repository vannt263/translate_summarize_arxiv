    "grbs detected by batse @xcite show a bimodality in the distribution of the duration ( usually characterized with @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "classification in two classes , short ( @xmath2s ) and long ( @xmath3s ) was also supported by the hardness ratio ( @xmath4 ) showing the short bursts to be harder than long ones @xcite .",
    "this classification in short and long bursts is widely accepted , as well as the understanding that they represent two different physical phenomena .",
    "batse and _ swift _ data also show some evidence for a third , intermediate group ( @xcite , @xcite ) . for simplicity , we here classify bursts only to short and long . here",
    "we review the @xmath0 and hardness ratio of _ swift _ grbs detected between dec 2004 and dec 2009 .",
    "our sample consists of 436 grbs , among which there are 145 with known redshift @xmath5 .",
    "all data were taken from the _ swift _ archive and the gamma ray bursts coordinates network .",
    "the ratio between the number of short and long bursts in the _ swift _ sample is roughly 1:10 , while in the batse sample it was about 1:3 .",
    "the duration distribution of bursts in the first _ swift _ bat grb catalogue does not show clear bimodality due to the smaller sample of short duration bursts @xcite .",
    "our results on number of grbs ( @xmath6 ) vs @xmath0 confirm this finding . to compare grbs in their rest frames , we focus on grbs with known redshift and take into account the cosmological time dilatation . fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] shows @xmath6 vs. @xmath7 .",
    "there is a gap between short and long grbs at @xmath8s .",
    "this is consistent with the gap at @xmath9s seen in the observer frame for batse bursts , but shifted to the average rest frame , i.e. to the average redshift of bursts in our sample : @xmath10 .",
    "we will use this gap in the final part of our analysis for classifying bursts into intrinsically short and long .",
    "( taking into account the correlation between burst duration and energy @xcite would give @xmath11 , @xmath12s and same grbs falling into the category of short / long bursts , therefore giving the same results as those presented below . ) +    .hardness ratios ( @xmath4s ) of _ swift _ grbs for different energy channels ( for details see text ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     @xmath13 in some cases , @xmath14 exceeds the mean value due to large data scatter .",
    "@xmath4s can have only non - negative values .",
    "for hardness ratio analysis we use the following energy channels : channel 1 : 15 - 25  kev , channel 2 : 25 - 50  kev , channel 3 : 50 - 100  kev , and channel 4 : 100 - 350 kev .",
    "we define @xmath15 as the ratio between fluence @xmath16 in channel @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we note that @xmath20 in @xcite roughly corresponds to our @xmath21 .",
    "results are presented in table  [ hr ] and fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] and depend on the channels used ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) .",
    "first we analyze all grbs and a subgroup of those with known redshift in the observer frame .",
    "we find the results for both groups to be consistent and the difference in @xmath4s among short and long bursts not very pronounced .",
    "then we make a rough approximation by assuming that the hardness ratio of an individual burst is the same in the observer and in the rest frame ( the transformation of fluences cancels out in the fluence ratio ) . in the transformation to the rest frame",
    ", only the burst duration @xmath0 is changed .",
    "if we take @xmath22s to separate bursts into short and long , we see that the difference in @xmath4s between long and short burst decreases . in some cases",
    "the median value of @xmath4s is even higher for long bursts than for short ones . on the other hand , by taking @xmath23s , we obtain results that are similar to the results in the observer frame for the same sample ."
