    "massive mimo is regarded as a promising technology in future wireless networks due to its high spectrum and energy efficiency @xcite .",
    "the large spatial degree of freedom ( dof ) of massive mimo systems can contribute to ( i ) spatial multiplexing gains for intra - cell users per bs ( mu - mimo ) as well as ( ii ) inter - cell interference mitigation between the bss via linear precoders at the bss . in @xcite ,",
    "zero - forcing ( zf ) and regularized zero - forcing ( rzf ) have been proposed for spatial multiplexing of data streams to intra - cell users .",
    "more complicated linear precoding schemes based on duality @xcite or semidefinite relaxing ( sdr ) @xcite have also been proposed to achieve a better performance . on the other hand ,",
    "the inter - cell interference mitigation between bss is more complicated .",
    "one commonly adopted approach to mitigate the inter - cell interference is the coordinated mimo strategy @xcite , which performs joint precoding among the bss using the global real - time csis shared among the bss . alternatively , cooperative mimo techniques can also be exploit to mitigate inter - cell interference by sharing both real - time csi and payload data among the concerned bss @xcite .",
    "however , these conventional spatial multiplexing and interference mitigation techniques can not be applied directly to massive mimo cellular networks due to the following reasons .",
    "first , the mu - mimo precoding requires real - time local csit at the bs .",
    "however , the amount of pilot symbols for channel estimation is limited by the coherence time of the channel and it is practically infeasible to obtain good csi quality when each bs is equipped with a massive mimo array .",
    "second , the existing inter - cell interference mitigation methods such as cooperative and coordinated mimo require real - time global csit , which is difficult to achieve in practice due to the backhaul latency . hence , the performance of these schemes is very sensitive to csit errors due to outdatedness .    in this paper , we address the above issues by proposing a hierarchical interference mitigation scheme for massive mimo cellular networks . in the proposed scheme , the mimo precoder at each bs is partitioned into an _ inner precoder _ and an _",
    "outer precoder _ as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hybridpc ] .",
    "the inner precoder is used to support mu - mimo ( control intra - cell interference and capture the spatial multiplexing gain ) at each bs and it is adaptive to real - time local csit .",
    "the outer precoder can leverage on the remaining spatial dof to mitigate the inter - cell interference by restricting the transmitted signal at each bs into a subspace and is adaptive to long - term channel statistics . ] .",
    "such hierarchical precoding structure simultaneously resolves both the aforementioned practical challenges .",
    "for instance , the issue of insufficient pilot symbols for real - time local csi estimation is resolved because the bs only needs to estimate the csi within the subspace determined by the outer precoder , which is of a much smaller dimension than the number of antennas .",
    "furthermore , the outer precoder is adaptive to the long - term channel statistics , which is insensitive to backhaul latency . as a result , the proposed _",
    "hierarchical precoding _",
    "framework exploits the spatial dof to simultaneously achieve spatial multiplexing per bs and inter - cell interference mitigation without expensive backhaul signaling requirement .",
    "we consider joint optimization of the outer precoders , the user selection , and the power allocation to maximize a general concave utility function of the average data rates of users .",
    "the following first - order challenges need to be addressed .    * * lack of closed - form optimization objective * : the average data rate of each user involves stochastic expectation over csi realizations and it does not have closed form characterization . * * complex coupling between user selection and outer precoding * : the outer precoder will affect the admissible user set .",
    "on the other hand , the optimization of outer precoder also depends on user selection because the outer precoder only needs to suppress the interference to the selected users in other bss . * * combinatorial optimization problem * : the user selection problem with hierarchical precoding in the massive mimo cellular networks is combinatorial with exponential complexity w.r.t .",

    "<S> outer precoder_. the inner precoder controls the intra - cell interference and is adaptive to local channel state information ( csi ) at each bs ( csit ) . the outer precoder controls the inter - cell interference and is adaptive to channel statistics . </S>",
    "<S> such hierarchical precoding structure reduces the number of pilot symbols required for csi estimation in massive mimo downlink and is robust to the backhaul latency . </S>",
    "<S> we study joint optimization of the outer precoders , the user selection , and the power allocation to maximize a general concave utility which has no closed - form expression . </S>",
    "<S> we first apply random matrix theory to obtain an approximated problem with closed - form objective . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the solution of the approximated problem is asymptotically optimal with respect to the original problem as the number of antennas per bs grows large . then using the hidden convexity of the problem </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an iterative algorithm to find the optimal solution for the approximated problem . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain a low complexity algorithm with provable convergence . </S>",
