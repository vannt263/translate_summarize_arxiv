    "ngc  6229 ( c1645 + 476 ) is one of the most remote globular clusters ( gcs ) associated with the galaxy , lying about 30  kpc from the galactic center ( harris 1996 ) .",
    "this outer - halo gc was studied photometrically by cohen ( 1986 ) and carney et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and , more recently , by borissova et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter bcss97 ) , who presented ccd photometry of the central part of this mildly concentrated gc ( @xmath2 ) . in none of these studies , however , was the turnoff ( to ) point of the cluster clearly reached , so that no conclusions regarding its age could be made .    as discussed extensively in the two previous papers of this series ( bcss97 ; catelan et al .",
    "1998 ) , ngc  6229 shows both a  gap \" on the blue horizontal branch ( hb ) and hb bimodality  unique characteristics among outer - halo gcs . as argued by many authors , an understanding of the nature of the detected peculiarities in  bimodal \" and  gap \" clusters would be of paramount importance for clarifying the nature of the so - called second - parameter phenomenon ( e.g. , buonanno et al .",
    "1985 ; catelan et al . 1998 ; ferraro et al . 1998 ; rood et al . 1993 ; stetson et al . 1996",
    "; sweigart 1999 ; sweigart & catelan 1998 ) . since age is one of the most prominent second - parameter candidates ( e.g. , chaboyer et al .",
    "1996b ) , and since it has been suggested that the outer - halo gc system is younger than the inner - halo one , obtaining deep photometry below the turnoff in ngc  6229 is clearly of considerable interest .",

    "we present , for the first time , deep @xmath0 photometry reaching below the ngc  6229 to level .",
    "our observational material and data reduction techniques are described in sect .  2 together with our analysis of the photometric errors and completeness corrections .",
    "several aspects of the colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of ngc  6229 including candidate blue straggler and extreme hb stars are described in sect .",
    "the metallicity of ngc  6229 , as determined from various photometric indicators , and its age relative to m5 , as derived from a differential application of both the  vertical \" and  horizontal \" methods , are then discussed in sects .  4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "in sect .",
    "6 we summarize the most important results of the present investigation .    in the next paper of this series , a detailed investigation of the rr lyrae population in ngc  6229 will be provided .",
    "our analysis is based on the following observational material :    \\1 . a large set of ccd frames obtained on the nights of august 25 - 26 1987 , at the calar alto observatory ( spain ) of the max - plank institute fr astronomie ( heidelberg ) , using the 3.5 m telescope equipped with a @xmath3 rca chip ( hereafter  ca dataset \" ) .",
    "the array scale was @xmath4 @xmath5 , giving a field of view of about @xmath6 . only the nine frames with the best seeing ( fwhm better than @xmath7 )",
    "were used to obtain the deep photometry down to @xmath8  mag presented in this paper .",
    "three partially overlapping fields , covering a total area of @xmath9 around the cluster center , were observed during the run .",
    "however , only short exposures ( @xmath10 ) were obtained in the field centered on the cluster center , while long exposures ( ranging from @xmath11 up to @xmath12 ) were secured only in the two more external fields placed at @xmath13 north - west and south - west with respect to the cluster center .",
    "fifty - four @xmath14 frames obtained on june 28 - 30 1997 , plus six @xmath14 frames obtained on october 6 - 8 1997 at the 2 m ritchey - chrtien telescope of the bulgarian national astronomical observatory  rozhen \" with a photometrics @xmath15 ccd camera ( hereafter  rozhen dataset \" ) .",
    "the seeing during these observations was @xmath16 with stable and very good photometric conditions .",
    "the scale at the cassegrain - focus ccd was @xmath17 and the observing area was @xmath18 , centered on the cluster center .",
    "ten @xmath19 and 10 @xmath1 frames obtained under the best photometric conditions were added up , resulting in total exposure times of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "two standard fields of m67 ( christian et al .",
    "1985 ) were taken before and after the observations , for calibration purposes .",
    "the stellar photometry of the frames was carried out independently using romafot ( buonanno et al .",
    "1983 ) for the ca dataset and daophot / allstar ( stetson 1993 ) for all other frames .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were determined for 1500  5000 stars on each frame .",
    "the instrumental values of all the  rozhen \" frames were transformed to the standard system using the standard field in m67 ( christian et al .",
    "due to unfavorable weather conditions during the ca run , no independent photometric calibration was possible for the ca dataset .",
    "for this reason , the magnitudes of this sample were originally referred to the @xmath14  johnson system using a large set of stars in common with carney et al .",
    "( 1991 ) . in order to check the compatibility of the magnitude systems of the two datasets",
    ", we adopted the following procedure : we first transformed the rozhen @xmath22 coordinate system to the ca local system and then searched for stars in common between the two datasets  resulting in a sample of more than 900 stars .",
    "the residuals in magnitude and colour for the stars in common do not show any systematic difference or trend so we can conclude that the two datasets are homogeneous in magnitude within the errors .",
    "this result also suggests that the calibration obtained for the rozhen dataset and adopted for the whole dataset presented in this paper nicely agrees with the carney et al .",
    "( 1991 ) zero point .      in order to estimate the internal accuracy of our ccd measurements for the rozhen dataset",
    ", we used the formal errors from the daophot package and the rms frame - to - frame scatter of the instrumental magnitudes .",
    "the formal errors for all stars vs. their magnitudes are displayed in figure  1 .",
    "as can be seen , we have large errors ( @xmath23  mag ) for @xmath24  mag and @xmath25  mag , which therefore define the faint limit of the rozhen photometry ( @xmath26  mag fainter than the to point in @xmath1 ) .    following the method described in ferraro & paresce ( 1993 )",
    ", we calculated the rms frame - to - frame scatter of the instrumental magnitudes of the 15 @xmath19 and @xmath1 frames from the rozhen dataset obtained in the same seeing and fwhm .",
    "the plot of the rms scatter vs. the mean magnitudes in the @xmath19 and @xmath1 filters is given in figure  2 .",
    "the mean rms scatter in both filters over the whole magnitude interval is 0.02  mag .",
    "the errors in the ca case , given in table  1 , were determined as the rms scatter of multiple measures of stars observed in the overlapping regions of adjacent fields .",

    "all the employed methods agree within the errors that ngc  6229 and m5 are essentially coeval .. we find that this region is particularly subject to spurious photometric blends ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) , and thus  unlike what is claimed by chaboyer et al .",
    " is subject to potentially large observational errors . ]",
    "the weighted mean age difference between ngc  6229 and m5 from the three determinations is :    @xmath212    for a comparison of the age of m5 with those of other gcs of comparable metallicity , we refer the reader to vandenberg et al .",

    "in the present paper we have presented the first deep cmd for the outer - halo globular cluster ngc  6229 from data obtained at the calar alto and rozhen observatories .",
    "the combined cmd reaches @xmath213  mag below the main - sequence turnoff of the cluster .",
    "the perfect alignment of the upper rgbs in ngc 6229 and m5 suggests that they must have the same metallicity .",
    "this is confirmed by our _ photometric _ estimate of ngc 6229 s metallicity ( @xmath169_{cg97\\,\\,scale } } = -1.1\\pm 0.1 $ ] dex ) , which fully agrees with the spectroscopic measurements obtained by cg97 and sneden et al .",

    "once the offset between the wachter et al . and",
    "cg97 metallicity scales found for gcs in common between the two studies is properly taken into account ( carretta & gratton 1998 ) , this corresponds to @xmath169_{cg97\\,\\,scale } } = -1.2\\pm 0.1 $ ]  dex ;    \\2 .",
    "the cmd of ngc  6229 is entirely compatible with the one for m5 ( sandquist et al .",
    "1996 ) , implying that the two clusters have nearly identical ages .",
    "indeed , a quantitative measurement of the age difference between the two gcs using three different methods shows them to have the same ages to within @xmath215  gyr .",
    "however , the hb morphologies of the two clusters do differ in detail , ngc  6229 s extending to bluer colours than m5 s ( with a likely extreme hb population present ) and showing a  dip \" in the number counts at the rr lyrae level ( see the appendix in catelan et al .",

    "associated with this population , we find a hint of a ( second )  gap \" at the faint end of the blue hb .",
    "ngc  6229 is the only known outer - halo globular with hb gap(s ) and a bimodal hb ( bcss97 ; catelan et al .",

    "confirmation of the bss and ehb populations , as well as a detailed analysis of the radial population gradients discussed by bcss97 and in sect .",
