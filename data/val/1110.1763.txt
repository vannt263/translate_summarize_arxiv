    "classical gibbs ensemble methods have been extensively applied to galerkin representation of turbulent systems , and many examples can be found in the literature .",
    "the first studies of the statistical mechanics of discrete distributions of vortices in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) flow using a hamiltonian formalism can be found in @xcite .",
    "later , it was shown @xcite that gibbsian statistical mechanics can be applied to galerkin truncations of the hydrodynamic and magneto hydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations .",
    "this allowed many studies of continuous vorticity distribution in truncated 2d inviscid flows @xcite , where absolute equilibrium spectra for the quadratic conserved quantities of the system were derived .",
    "following @xcite , in @xcite the absolute inviscid equilibrium ensemble for three - dimensional ( 3d ) euler flows was considered .",
    "later , 3d inviscid magneto hydrodynamic mhd equilibrium solutions were investigated in @xcite , and recently the approach was extended to hall - mhd in @xcite .",
    "other problems studied in this framework include geophysical flows @xcite , fast rotating flows @xcite , and formulations of one- and two - layer quasi - geostrophic models @xcite . in general , classical gibbs ensemble methods",
    "can be applied to systems with quadratic conserved quantities and that satisfy the liouville theorem , which implies the incompressibility of the flow in phase space ( e.g. , the space of complex fourier modes ) .    in the absolute equilibrium , fields have gaussian statistics and the quadratic conserved quantities of the system have associated temperatures that can be positive or negative . in the former case ,",
    "the quantity is said to `` thermalize '' , and the quantity in the equilibrium is equally distributed among all modes in the system . in the latter case",
    "the quantity `` condenses , '' and is accumulated at the gravest modes . however ,",
    "forced - dissipative turbulent systems are far from equilibrium , as the effect of viscosity prevents relaxation towards a true equilibrium state , giving rise to solutions with non - zero flux ( cascades ) and making direct comparison with equilibrium solutions inadequate . in spite of this",
    ", gibbs ensemble methods proved useful to predict the direction of the cascades in many forced - dissipative systems , depending on whether the quantity of interest thermalized or condensed in the associated truncated inviscid system ( see , e.g. , @xcite , although note not all inverse cascades in forced - dissipative systems are associated with condensates in the statistical equilibrium of the equivalent truncated ideal system @xcite ) .",
    "the recent finding of transients and quasi - stable states in truncated inviscid flows , in which non - thermalized modes behave as in the viscous case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , has renewed interest in classical gibbs ensembles , indicating more information than just the direction of the cascades can be extracted from these systems . in particular , it was found that at early times and as the system evolves towards equilibrium , a comparison between the inviscid system and a viscous turbulent flow can be achieved by considering in the inviscid system the net effect of the modes that have already thermalized as an effective viscosity acting on the non - thermalized modes @xcite .",
    "this viscous - like dynamics was reported in many systems , including the 3d truncated euler equation @xcite , 3d truncated rotating flows @xcite , 2d truncated mhd @xcite , and turbulent bose - einstein condensates using the truncated gross - pitaevskii equations @xcite . in this latter case , the truncated equations allowed the study of thermalization of bose - einstein condensates at finite temperature .",
    "classical gibbs ensembles and quasi - stable states were also used to study the behavior of atmospheric models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , as the need to study atmospheric and oceanic flow dynamics has led to a variety of approximate models derived from the 3d navier - stokes equation for stratified and rotating flows ( see for example @xcite ) . in the often used geostrophic approximation ,",
    "the vertical component of the velocity field is assumed zero ( @xmath0 ) , and hydrostatic balance is solved in that direction while a linear balance between the coriolis force and the pressure gradient is solved on the horizontal plane .",
    "another family of models is given by the so - called quasi - geostrophic ( qg ) models , which are a first order departure from the linear geostrophic balance on the horizontal plane . that the truncated qg systems satisfy the liouville theorem , thus allowing the use of gibbs ensemble methods ,",
    "can be seen , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a particular case of the qg models is the surface quasi - geostrophic ( sqg ) approximation @xcite , which describes rotating stratified flows with constant potential vorticity . in this model ,",
    "the vertical gradient of the stream function @xmath1 matches a scalar field ( the density field @xmath2 or the potential temperature @xmath3 ) at a flat surface @xmath4 .",
    "the scalar field is identified with the horizontal laplacian @xmath5 , and the equation for the advection of this scalar by the incompressible surface flow @xmath6 is solved .",
    "contrary to 3d qg turbulence whose dynamics is driven by large - scale interior potential vorticity gradients , sqg flows are entirely driven by density or potential temperature variations at the surface . recently , this system has been used to study the dynamics of the upper troposphere @xcite , and of the upper oceanic layers with relative accuracy down to @xmath7 meters @xcite .",
    "turbulence in forced - dissipative sqg systems ( including direction of cascades and scaling laws ) has also been studied in numerical simulations @xcite .    besides potential applications in ocean and atmospheric dynamics , the sqg equations have interest from the mathematical and physical points of view .",
    "although the sqg equations are 2d in nature , their dynamics share similarities with the 3d euler equations , and whether a singularity in the gradients of the scalar field develops at finite time from smooth initial conditions has been the focus of many mathematical and numerical studies @xcite . although there is no clear - cut answer for the most general case , a singularity has been ruled out for the case in which isolevels of the scalar contain a hyperbolic saddle @xcite .",
    "in the same context , numerical comparisons between the dynamics of the inviscid and viscous sqg equations were carried in @xcite .",
    "more recently , cascades in the sqg equations have received attention from the physical point of view , as it was found that large - scales in sqg flows have conformal invariant properties @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the classical gibbs ensemble solution of the truncated inviscid sqg equations , and compare these solutions and their viscous - like transient with solutions of the dissipative sqg equations . in particular , we derive solutions for the pseudo - energy and pseudo - enstrophy equilibrium spectrum , verify numerically the convergence of the truncated sqg solutions to the statistical equilibrium solutions , and compare inviscid and viscous numerical results .",
    "the statistical equilibrium solution indicates the pseudo - enstrophy thermalizes while the pseudo - energy condenses in sqg , in agreement with previous numerical results where a direct cascade of pseudo - enstrophy and an inverse cascade of pseudo - energy were reported @xcite . in the viscous - like transient ,",
    "we observe the development of inertial ranges with @xmath8 scaling for the spectrum of the pseudo - enstrophy , unlike previous inviscid simulations where steeper power laws were observed @xcite . finally , we present an analogy between the non - thermalized fraction of the pseudo - energy and pseudo - enstrophy in the inviscid truncated runs , and the free decay of the pseudo - energy and pseudo - enstrophy in the viscous sqg equations at very large reynolds number .",
    "the analogy allows us to identify possible asymptotic behavior for very large reynolds numbers .",

    "it is worth noting that such a decay is also compatible with strict mathematical bounds for the decay of pseudo - enstrophy derived in @xcite .",

    ", the decay of viscous sqg can be understood as follows . at early times",
    ", @xmath145 remains approximately constant as the inertial range spectrum develops .",
    "as the smallest scales have not been excited yet , dissipative effects are negligible . once turbulence develops , the decay law @xmath158 is observed .",
    "the decay rate in this stage is dominated by the turbulent cascade of the pseudo - enstrophy towards smaller scales , and the time evolution is given by the balance equation @xmath165 where the flux of pseudo - enstrophy @xmath132 is controlled by the non - linear term in the equation , and independent of the value of the viscosity @xmath166 as long as the reynolds number is large enough . as a result , the truncated inviscid run , although it has a different effective viscosity , shows the same decay .",
    "later , all pseudo - enstrophy that remains in the system is associated with the condensation of pseudo - energy at @xmath65 , and this remaining pseudo - energy ( as well as the pseudo - enstrophy ) can only decay exponentially in the viscous run ( fig .  [ fig : gexp ] ) , while it remains constant in the inviscid run ( fig .",

    "as most of the pseudo - energy condenses , there is no significant change in @xmath121 with time .",

    "it is worth noting that a slow down in the decay of the pseudo - energy as the viscosity was decreased was already observed in @xcite .",
    "so far , random initial conditions were used in all runs . to analyze sensitivity of the decay to other initial conditions , we briefly discuss results for three initial conditions often used in studies of singularities in the qg equations",
    "@xcite : @xmath168 @xmath169 @xmath170    initial conditions @xmath171 and @xmath172 lead to the same decay of the pseudo - enstrophy @xmath147 as observed in the previous simulations ( see fig .",

    "further analysis showed that the flow resulting from this initial condition , which initially activates only a few modes in fourier space , develops a much steeper pseudo - energy and pseudo - enstrophy spectra .",
    "as discussed above , a fully developed turbulent spectrum is needed to observe the self - similar decay in the enstrophy .     and @xmath172 , @xmath87 and @xmath164 .",
    "both runs show a decay compatible with @xmath174.,width=340 ]    as previously mentioned , the @xmath158 decay observed in the simulations is consistent with the upper limit of strict mathematical bounds derived for the decay of pseudo - enstrophy ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . from the physical point of view , it is interesting that such a decay law can be related with the decay followed by other systems that develop condensates in the inviscid truncated case , and large - scale coherent structures in the viscous case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in 2d navier - stokes turbulence ,",
    "the separation of scales between energy containing scales and enstrophy containing scales ( as the former is concentrated at large scales while the latter is concentrated at small scales ) , together with assumptions of weak coupling between these scales @xcite , led to the idea that the decay of 2d navier - stokes turbulence can be understood as the superposition of a coherent ( condensated ) state , and a random phase , separated by a `` fuzzy scale '' following ideas developed for bose - einstein condensates @xcite . in sqg , from the results in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we can consider a pseudo - energy containing scale associated with the condensation of pseudo - energy at low wavenumbers , which contains almost all of the system pseudo - energy , and a pseudo - enstrophy containing scale concentrating most of the pseudo - enstrophy . in the inviscid truncated case",

    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_todos ] shows the time evolution of @xmath180 in the truncated inviscid runs with @xmath87 and @xmath85 with random initial conditions , @xmath181 appears a reasonable fit ; the other simulations are also consistent with this power law .",
    "we derived statistical equilibrium solutions of the truncated inviscid sqg equations , and verified their validity at late times in numerical simulations of the truncated sqg equations .",
    "numerical spectra are in agreement with the theory at all wavenumbers , although as resolution is increased it takes longer times for the system to reach equilibrium .",
    "we also studied the evolution towards equilibrium of the ideal runs , finding that both pseudo - energy and pseudo - enstrophy spectra develop a viscous - like inertial range with slopes @xmath8 and @xmath110 respectively , and compatible with kolmogorov - batchelor - kraichnan phenomenology .",
    "note that in previous studies of the inviscid sqg equations , a steeper power law was observed @xcite , but the initial conditions @xmath173 that were used result in steeper spectra for the pseudo - energy and pseudo - enstrophy .",
    "as time evolves , the pseudo - enstrophy in our runs shows a gradual thermalization of higher wavenumber modes with @xmath111 , narrowing the viscous - like inertial range .",
    "the spectrum for the pseudo - energy presents a flat scaling for high wavenumbers and a peak at @xmath65 , showing condensation of pseudo - energy at small wavenumbers instead of thermalization .    defining @xmath122 and @xmath120 respectively as the pseudo - enstrophy and pseudo - energy contained in the thermalized modes",
    ", we studied the period of time during which these quantities are time - dependent . through this period , the transfer of pseudo - enstrophy towards thermalized modes results in a viscous - like cascade with effective viscosity associated with the thermalized modes .",
    "this allowed us to compare spectra and decay in ideal runs with runs subjected to identical initial conditions but with the addition of dissipation .",
    "the large scales of both systems are similar and both systems develop a @xmath110 power law for the pseudo - energy in accordance with the theoretical results . at later times , the power law is lost due to thermalization in the inviscid runs and dissipation in the viscous runs .",
    "we compared the free decay of @xmath145 with the time evolution of the non - thermalized @xmath146 in inviscid truncated runs for different grid sizes . following an initial period of time",
    "in which the pseudo - enstrophy is quasi - conserved , viscous cases develop a power - law decay compatible with @xmath158 for the largest reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions considered . later in time , the decay becomes shallower and an exponential viscous decay of the remaining pseudo - enstrophy follows .",
    "the power - law decay is in agreement with strict mathematical bounds for the decay of the pseudo - enstropy @xcite , and seems to be robust for initial conditions in which most of the pseudo - energy is held at the lowest modes . from the point of view of the statistical equilibrium solutions ,",
    "the decay law can be understood as the result of two decaying phases weakly interacting and separated by a fuzzy scale : a coherent ( condensated ) state that contains most of the pseudo - energy , and a random phase that contains most of the pseudo - enstrophy .    with the exception of a small delay in the time when the quasi - conservation is broken ,",
    "all the inviscid runs show the same evolution for the non - thermalized @xmath146 independently of the spatial resolution considered .",
    "the evolution of @xmath145 approaches that of @xmath123 as the reynolds number is increased .",
    "remarkably , inviscid systems as small as @xmath159 already give information about the free decay law expected for high reynolds viscous systems .",
    "this good agreement between the evolution of the non - thermalized components of the pseudo - enstrophy and the pseudo - energy in truncated inviscid runs at low resolution , and of the decay of pseudo - energy and pseudo - enstrophy in viscous runs at large resolution , further indicate a new application of inviscid simulations : that of estimating the decay law followed by the viscous system at very large reynolds number . in this light ,",
    "the decay of pseudo - enstrophy in sgq turbulence in the limit of very large reynolds number would be compatible with @xmath158 when all initial perturbations are at the gravest modes in the system .",
