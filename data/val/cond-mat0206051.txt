    "alb@xmath0-type compounds have not been studied systematically at high pressures .",
    "there seem to exist no confirmed reports on pressure - induced structural phase transitions in metal diborides .",
    "there are , however , structural studies of the rare - earth metal digallides gdga@xmath0 , hoga@xmath0 , erga@xmath0 , and tmga@xmath0 at high pressures @xcite . with the lighter rare earth elements",
    "la  er the digallides crystallize in the alb@xmath0  structure at ambient pressure .",
    "in essence , all of the rare - earth metal digallides studied so far show a transition to the uhg@xmath0 structure which is isotypic to alb@xmath0but with a lower @xmath4 ratio .",
    "the superconductor mgb@xmath0  was studied at high pressures with regard to its superconducting transition temperature @xcite , crystal structure @xcite , and lattice dynamics @xcite .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath3  could well be explained in the framework of phonon - mediated , i.e.  bcs , superconductivity @xcite .",
    "an isostructural transition near 30  gpa was reported @xcite but could not be reproduced in another study up to 40  gpa @xcite .",
    "much higher pressures may be necessary to induce transitions possibly towards the uhg@xmath0 structure .",
    "we study here the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the crystal structure and lattice dynamics of alb@xmath0 .",
    "synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction and raman scattering experiments are complemented by first - principles calculations .",
    "the present high - pressure study was in part motivated by the question whether some of the unusual physical properties of mgb@xmath0    such as the sizable anharmonicity @xcite or the remarkably large calculated pressure dependence @xcite of the @xmath1 phonon  are specific to mgb@xmath0  or whether they are characteristic of other alb@xmath0-type metal diborides as well .",

    "we will discuss possible consequences of metal deficiency for the superconductor mgb@xmath0  where this issue is also of relevance .",
    "the structural properties of alb@xmath0   under pressure were studied up to 40  gpa by monochromatic ( @xmath5   ) x - ray powder diffraction at the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf grenoble , beamline id30 ) . commercially available alb@xmath0  powder ( alfa aesar , 99% ) was placed in a diamond anvil cell ( dac ) for pressure generation .",
    "nitrogen was employed as a pressure medium to provide nearly hydrostatic conditions .",
    "diffraction patterns were recorded on image plates and then integrated @xcite to yield intensity vs.  @xmath6 diagrams .",
    "raman spectra of alb@xmath0  up to 25  gpa ( dac , 4:1  methanol / ethanol mixture as a pressure medium ) were excited at 633  nm utilizing a long - distance microscope objective .",
    "they were recorded in back - scattering geometry using a single - grating spectrometer with a multi - channel ccd detector and a holographic notch filter for suppression of the laser line ( dilor labram ) . for the raman experiments",

    "additional peaks appear at pressures above 2  gpa due to various phases of solid nitrogen . ]",
    "lattice parameters as a function of pressure were determined from rietveld - type fits of the diffraction diagrams .",
    "the compressibility of alb@xmath0  is moderately anisotropic as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : lp - vol](a ) with the softer direction being parallel to the @xmath8 axis .",
    "up to 40  gpa , compression along @xmath8 is 47% larger than along @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath4 ratio decreases from 1.083 ( 0  gpa ) to 1.060 at 40  gpa . from the lattice parameters we determine the unit cell volume as a function of pressure as shown in fig .",

    "the data are well represented by the murnaghan relation @xcite @xmath10^{-1/b'}$ ] . with @xmath11",
    "@xmath12 fixed at the value determined from the zero - pressure data we obtain by least - squares fitting the bulk modulus @xmath13 and its pressure derivative @xmath14 at zero pressure as listed in table  [ tab : structure ] .    as a function of pressure ,",

    "the lines are given by the murnaghan equation of state with the parameters listed in table  [ tab : structure ] . ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     since the deviation of the theoretical results from the experimental data is larger than usual we performed a second calculation of the @xmath1 frequency under pressure using a rather different approach , namely linear - response - theory ( lrt ) in the lda with the abinit package .",
    "consistent with the common overestimation of bond strengths in the lda we obtain here a somewhat larger zero - pressure phonon frequency , such that the two theoretical values bracket the experimental data at zero pressure . over the whole pressure",
    "range the lda / lrt calculation gives phonon frequencies which are consistently @xmath22.4% larger than the corresponding gga / fp results .",
    "consequently , we obtain essentially the same pressure dependence @xmath15 for the two calculations . the deviation of the calculations from the experimental data is far beyond the typical uncertainty of such computations",
    "the important difference between theory and experiment could be that the former is based on the ideal stoichiometry al@xmath16b@xmath0 whereas the real sample is al deficient .    for comparison with previous calculations for mgb@xmath0",
    "we have also calculated the frequency @xmath17 of the @xmath18 phonon in alb@xmath0  ( out - plane motion of the boron atoms @xcite ) , see table  [ tab : phonons ] .",
    "the pressure dependence is characterized by a mode - grneisen parameter @xmath19 . in case of a constant , i.e. , pressure - independent @xmath20 the relation @xmath21 holds .",
    "thus , for both the @xmath1 and the @xmath18 mode in alb@xmath0  with @xmath22 there is a nearly inverse - proportional relation between the phonon frequency and volume .",
    "this is quite different from the situation in mgb@xmath0  where we do not only have the very large @xmath23 for the @xmath1 mode as noted before but also a rather small @xmath24 for the @xmath18 phonon ( table  [ tab : phonons ] ) .",
    "the frozen phonon calculations also yield information on the anharmonicity of the phonon modes as described in the context of our mgb@xmath0  calculations @xcite .",
    "in essence , the variation of the total energy with atomic displacement , @xmath25 , can be represented by a polynomial where the ratio of the quartic to squared quadratic coefficients @xmath26 is a measure of anharmonicity . in the harmonic limit @xmath27 . for the @xmath1 mode in alb@xmath0",
    "we obtain @xmath28  ev@xmath29 which is about three orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding values for mgb@xmath0  of @xmath308  ev@xmath29 ( see refs .  ) .",
    "small anharmonicities are calculated for the @xmath18 modes of both compounds : @xmath31 for alb@xmath0  and @xmath32 for mgb@xmath0 .",
    "in our x - ray diffraction and raman experiments we do not find any indication for a structural phase transition or modulation of the structure .",
    "group - subgroup symmetry considerations @xcite indicate numerous possible distortions of the aristotype alb@xmath0  most of which are realized in intermetallic compounds at ambient pressure .",
    "pressure - induced structural phase transitions of xy@xmath33 intermetallic compounds have not been studied systematically . in the context of the alb@xmath0  structure a number of rare - earth metal digallides @xcite , khg@xmath0 @xcite , and lacu@xmath0",
    "@xcite were investigated at high pressures . from the available data a transition between the structure types alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 appears as a typical route .",
    "the khg@xmath0 ( cecu@xmath0 ) structure type may occur as an intermediate phase .",
    "alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 are isopointal structures , distinguished only by their @xmath4 ratios .",
    "two clearly separated groups of compounds of alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 type are observed when plotting the @xmath4 ratio versus ratio of the metallic radii of xy@xmath0 intermetallic compounds @xcite .",
    "the alb@xmath0  and uhg@xmath0 type branches are characterized by @xmath4 ratios of 0.951.20 and 0.600.85 , respectively .",
    "the compound alb@xmath0  with @xmath34 ( at 0  gpa ) is located near the center of the former branch . in the pressure range to 40  gpa explored here",
    "it decreases only to 1.060 .",
    "pressures well above 1  mbar may therefore be needed for a possible transition towards the uhg@xmath0 structure . at lower pressures",
    "a transition involving a buckling of the boron honeycomb layers may occur which could lead to phases of the cecu@xmath0 , cecd@xmath0 , or cain@xmath0 type @xcite .",
    "raman spectroscopy is commonly applied to semiconductors and insulators but only to a much smaller extend to metals .",
    "it is essentially the group of elemental hcp metals that has been studied systematically , already in the late 1960s at ambient pressure @xcite and more recently at high pressures ( see e.g.  refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "it may therefore be attributed to a lack of reference data that in case of mgb@xmath0  the observation of a very broad raman feature ( fwhm of @xmath2300  ) near 600  lead to a still unresolved controversy over the origin of this peak .",
    "it has initially been attributed @xcite to the raman - active @xmath1 mode which immediately raises the question of the large linewidth .",
    "the large peak width has been related to both strong electron phonon coupling and to structural disorder .",
    "the latter now appears less likely because raman spectra of mgb@xmath0  powders are quite similar to those of recently available small single crystals @xcite which are presumably less disordered .",
    "high - pressure raman experiments @xcite have cast doubt on the assignment to the @xmath1 phonon . they revealed a double - peak structure with peaks at 603(6 )  and 750(20 )  .",
    "neither of the two peaks could be attributed to the @xmath1 mode because of severe deviations from calculated phonon frequencies in terms of zero - pressure frequencies and/or the pressure dependences .",
    "the present raman data of alb@xmath0  show that it is possible to obtain raman spectra with a well - defined @xmath1 peak from metallic samples of the alb@xmath0  structure .",
    "the difficulties encountered in case of mgb@xmath0  are therefore not likely related to the metallicity of the sample nor intrinsic to the structure type .",
    "crystallinity also appears to have only a small effect on the raman spectrum as the raman linewidth of the alb@xmath0  powder sample is comparable to that of the alb@xmath0  crystallites .",
    "there are two properties of mgb@xmath0  with regard to phonons which make it distinct from alb@xmath0 .",
    "first , the whole @xmath1 phonon branch along the @xmath35@xmath36 direction in the brillouin zone exhibits very strong electron - phonon coupling in mgb@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "second , the @xmath37 mode shows pronounced anharmonicity @xcite .",
    "both electron - phonon and phonon - phonon interaction decrease the phonon lifetime and hence increase the phonon linewidth @xcite .",
    "they are therefore the most likely causes for the absence of a well - defined @xmath1 raman peak in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "our x - ray diffraction data indicate an al deficiency of 11% in alb@xmath0  in accord with previous density measurements and chemical analysis @xcite as well as recent single - crystal x - ray diffraction results @xcite .",
    "although the change of the @xmath1 phonon frequency at different sample spots suggests that there is some variation of the al content , there is no indication that growth of aluminum diboride in the composition al@xmath38b@xmath0 is possible .",
    "the occurrence of substantial metal deficiency appears to be common to many ( transition ) metal diborides @xcite .    at ambient pressure .",
    "energies are given with respect to the fermi energy @xmath39 .",
    "the dos is given in units of ( states / ev / formula unit ) . ]    in case of alb@xmath0  this metal deficiency has important influence on the electronic structure .",
    "a comparison of the calculated bandstructures of alb@xmath0  and mgb@xmath0  shows that the relative ordering and dispersions of the bands near the fermi level are very similar .",
    "the difference between alb@xmath0and mgb@xmath0  can largely be treated in a rigid - band picture with a higher band filling for alb@xmath0 .",
    "it is therefore justified to discuss the observed al deficiency of @xmath210% in a rigid - band picture , too .",
    "figure  [ fig : bs - dos ] shows the calculated electronic bandstructure @xcite and density of states of alb@xmath0 . in case of the stoichiometric compound",
    "the @xmath40-type bands derived from boron @xmath41 states and the bands with al-@xmath42 character ( near @xmath35 ) are partially filled and give rise to the metallic state .",
    "10% deficiency of al removes 0.3 valence electrons and consequently lowers @xmath39 by 0.9  ev which leads to a _",
    "complete depletion of the band with character_. in other words , the experimentally observed al deficiency is expected to lead to a qualitative change in the electronic structure compared to the ideal case of al@xmath16b@xmath0 . in terms of the fermi surface",
    "this change means a removal of the electron pocket around @xmath35 .",
    "the measured mode - grneisen parameter of the al@xmath43b@xmath0 sample is @xmath220% larger than calculated for al@xmath38b@xmath0 , a deviation which is far beyond the typical uncertainty of such computations .",
    "the zero - pressure phonon frequency , on the other hand , seems to be hardly affected .",
    "the apparent difference between experiment and calculation is the al deficiency of the sample which was not taken into account in the theory .",
    "we tentatively attribute the discrepancy between the experimental and calculated mode - grneisen parameters to the al - deficiency - induced electronic changes discussed above .",
    "however , it can not be excluded at this point that other effects are also at work .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the effect of al deficiency on the electronic and lattice dynamical properties of alb@xmath0  is , however , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "mg deficiency in mgb@xmath0  was often indicated by the occurrence of mgo as a secondary phase in mgb@xmath0  samples that were grown from a molar 1:2 mixture of mg and b. variations of @xmath3  and even more of the pressure dependence of @xmath3  for different samples appeared to be related to non - stoichiometry of the material .",
    "the correlation between composition , structural parameters and @xmath3  has been established in an experiment by indenbom _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . by diffusion of mg into a boron cylinder they produced a sample with a composition changing gradually between mg@xmath38b@xmath0 and mg@xmath44b@xmath0 . with decreasing mg",
    "content the lattice parameter @xmath8 increased by 0.003   ( 0.1% ) and @xmath3  increased from 37.2 to 39.0  k.    tissen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite furthermore pointed out a correlation between the zero - pressure critical temperature @xmath45 and the pressure derivative @xmath46 : as @xmath45 increases from 37.3 to 39.2  k for various samples , @xmath46 changes from @xmath47 to @xmath48  k / gpa .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite discussed a similar observation on a smaller number of samples in terms of the electronic band structure and band - filling effects related to the mg non - stoichiometry . on the other hand ,",
    "the pressure - induced changes of the electronic density of states calculated for mgb@xmath0  are too small to account for the observed decrease of @xmath3  under compression @xcite .",
    "it is rather the increase in the relevant phonon frequencies which provides the main contribution to the pressure dependence of @xmath3  @xcite",
    ". it would therefore be rather surprising if electronic density effects ",
    "i.e. , the electronic density @xmath49 at the fermi level  were responsible for the large sensitivity of @xmath46 on mg non - stoichiometry .",
    "the indications that al deficiency in alb@xmath0  may affect the pressure dependence of the @xmath1 phonon frequency hints at an alternative possible explanation for the large sensitivity of @xmath46 on mg deficiency in mgb@xmath0 .",
    "it was first pointed out by yilderim _",
    "et al._@xcite that the @xmath1 phonon mode in mgb@xmath0  exhibits a very large anharmonicity .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed theoretically that this effect arises in mgb@xmath0  because here the fermi level @xmath39 is located only @xmath20.5  ev below the top of @xmath50 bands of the equilibrium structure .",
    "the lattice distortion of the @xmath1 mode induces a splitting of these @xmath50 bands large enough that the lower split - off band sinks completely below @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this does not happen in alb@xmath0and graphite , and anharmonicity is indeed negligible .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the @xmath1 mode in alb@xmath0  is much higher in energy than the @xmath18 phonon whereas the reversed order is calculated for mgb@xmath0  ( see table  [ tab : phonons ] ) although both compounds are structurally quite similar .",
    "this effect was pointed out before and studied in mg@xmath51al@xmath52b@xmath0 mixed crystals by renker _",
    "et al . _",
    "the interchange , which occurs only in undoped or moderately substituted material ( @xmath53 ) , was also attributed to the electronic changes , especially the disappearance of the hole pockets from the fermi surface for @xmath54 .",
    "the metal content in mgb@xmath0  affects the band filling , a larger mg deficiency moving the fermi level further below the top of the @xmath50  bands .",
    "it is therefore to be expected that the anharmonicity of the @xmath1 mode should decrease with decreasing mg content .",
    "lattice dynamical calculations showed that the @xmath1 anharmonicity decreases with increasing pressure @xcite and the initially very large mode - grneisen parameter decreases too @xcite .",
    "if the mode - grneisen parameters decreases as function of band filling at ambient pressure , i.e. , due to non - stoichiometry of mgb@xmath0 , it would , qualitatively , lead to the observed relation between @xmath46 and mg deficiency .",
    "this effect would be a manifestation of the changes of the lattice dynamics rather than changes of the electronic density of states .",
    "a more detailed and quantitative analysis is certainly needed , but the present results are indication of the importance of stoichiometry with regard to the superconducting properties of mgb@xmath0 , specifically the pressure dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "we have studied the crystal structure of alb@xmath0  by x - ray powder diffraction to 40  gpa .",
    "the compressibility is moderately anisotropic consistent with the anisotropic bonding properties . in the pressure range",
    "studied here we did not observe a structural phase transition .",
    "our x - ray diffraction data indicate an al deficiency of @xmath211% in agreement with previous reports . despite the neglect of this non - stoichiometry in our first - principles calculations , the calculated structural properties are in good agreement with the experiment .    the @xmath1 zone - center phonon in metallic alb@xmath0  can be observed as a well - defined raman peak .",
    "we conclude that the lack of such a raman feature in mgb@xmath0  is neither related to the metallicity or disorder of the sample nor is it a generic property of alb@xmath0-type compounds .",
    "our observations rather support the view that it is due to the strong electron - phonon coupling and/or anharmonicity which are distinct properties of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we found some deviation of the calculated pressure dependence of the @xmath1 phonon frequency of alb@xmath0  from the experimental data and tentatively attributed this to the al deficiency of the alb@xmath0  sample which was not taken into account in the theory .",
    "correlations between non - stoichiometry of mgb@xmath0  and its superconducting properties have been pointed out previously . here",
    "we considered possible effects of mg deficiency in mgb@xmath0  on its electronic structure and lattice dynamics .",
    "the anticipated changes are consistent with the available experimental data on the correlation between mg content and the pressure dependence of @xmath3 .",
    "this leads us to propose that the large variation of the pressure dependence of @xmath3  ( @xmath55 to @xmath47 k / gpa ) in mgb@xmath0  in various experiments may be caused by the effect of non - stoichiometry on the lattice dynamics , mediated via changes in the electronic structure of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we thank yu .",
    "grin for calling our attention to the issue of the non - stoichiometry of alb@xmath0 .",
