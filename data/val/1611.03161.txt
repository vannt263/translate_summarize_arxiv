    "hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) interferometry ( also known as _ femtoscopy _ ) is a technique which has been used successfully over the past several decades of heavy - ion physics to probe the spatio - temporal and dynamical properties of freeze - out surfaces in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the observables derived from hbt interferometry , known as the hbt radii , thus provide a window into the shapes and sizes of these collisions .",
    "recently , the notion of studying the hbt radii on a collision - by - collision ( or _ event - by - event _ ) basis has been raised @xcite .",
    "this has motivated two distinct questions : ( 1 ) , whether event - by - event distributions of hbt radii ( or _ hbt distributions _ ) are even experimentally accessible , and ( 2 ) , if they are , what information they might contain about the properties of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the studies presented in refs . @xcite have answered the first question in the affirmative , and have addressed the second question by demonstrating that experimental measurements of the statistical moments of hbt distributions could potentially yield sensitivity to other interesting quantities , such as the value ( and temperature dependence ) of the specific shear viscosity @xmath1 in the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "probing hbt distributions experimentally may therefore yield valuable insights into the properties of relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "one of the most successful theoretical and phenomenological approaches to date for understanding the properties of heavy - ion collisions involves numerically simulating the various stages of their evolution on an event - by - event basis , and using these simulations to make predictions which can be compared with experimental measurements of event - by - event heavy - ion observables . in particular ,",
    "a great deal of attention has been paid in this regard to event - by - event fluctuations of observables related to radial flow ( @xmath2 ) @xcite , anisotropic flow ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , total multiplicity ( @xmath4 ) @xcite , and so on . to extend the successes of this event - by - event hydrodynamic paradigm to include the hbt radii , then , clearly requires the ability to simulate hbt analyses on an event - by - event basis .",
    "an essential component of any hbt analysis , whether experimental or theoretical , involves properly accounting for the presence of resonance decay contributions to the final pion yields . in the case of experimental hbt , these resonance decay contributions are a contaminating factor which can never be completely eliminated . theoretically , on the other hand , the resonance decay contributions must be computed separately , in addition to the thermally produced ( or  directly emitted \" ) pions of interest . since the effects of resonances can not be completely separated experimentally from the effects of direct pion emission , an apples - to - apples comparison between theory and experiment therefore requires theoretical analyses to compute the hbt radii with the resonance decay contributions included .",
    "thus , before the experimental accessibility of hbt distributions ( and their connections to other aspects of heavy - ion physics ) can be systematically explored from the perspective of hydrodynamics , one must first be able to compute the hbt radii on an event - by - event basis , with all relevant resonance decay contributions included .    in the context of numerical simulations of heavy - ion collisions , such as those considered here ,",
    "there are at least two different possible approaches to accomplishing this @xcite .",
    "the first involves terminating the hydrodynamic evolution prior to kinetic freeze - out , converting the entire system to a collection of interacting hadrons whose initial distributions ( at the point of conversion ) are sampled from cooper - frye distributions @xcite , and allowing those hadrons to scatter microscopically until all interactions cease because the matter has become too dilute .",
    "such an approach is typically called a  hybrid \" approach @xcite .",
    "the second approach involves applying a hydrodynamic description of the system all the way until the entire system has reached kinetic freeze - out , implemented as a sharp transition to free - streaming particles on the so - called freeze - out hypersurface @xmath5 .",
    "this approach is often termed a ",
    "purely hydrodynamic \" approach .",
    "the hybrid approach has the advantage of describing the actual physical situation in heavy - ion collisions more realistically : two - particle correlations are always probed _ experimentally _ with only a finite number of particles per event .",
    "this means that , in order to obtain good statistical precision , the hadronic `` afterburner '' must be run multiple times on a single hydrodynamic event . in the purely hydrodynamic approach",
    "the two - particle correlations ( and therefore the associated hbt radii ) are computed as cooper - frye integrals @xcite of the phase - space - distribution function over the freeze - out surface which provides results without statistical uncertainties ( in effect implementing the assumption that each event emits an infinite number of particles ) . in this paper",
    ", we adopt the purely hydrodynamic approach .    as we discuss below",
    ", this problem is computationally complex , especially when all resonance decay contributions are included .",
    "in fact , this complexity is the primary reason that the studies @xcite omitted the resonance decay contributions from their analyses . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a code designed to address the challenge of efficiently computing hbt correlation functions and radii ( with all resonance decay effects included ) from pure hydrodynamics on an event - by - event basis , thereby allowing a systematic exploration of hbt distributions in heavy - ion collisions to be performed within a reasonable timeframe .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2b ] , we will define the two - particle correlation function , and sec .",
    "[ sec2c ] will show how the hbt radii are extracted from the correlation function . in order to interpret these radii in terms of spatio - temporal structure of the emitting source",
    ", we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec2d1 ] how they may be computed directly from the emission function which defines the emission probability along the freeze - out surface . in particular , we will show that the hbt radii may be determined from the fourier - transform of the emission function , and will use this feature to show how they can be related directly to the emission function .",
    "the emission function , in turn , will generally receive contributions from particles emitted directly by the source , as well as from particles which are decay products of other directly emitted particles . in sec .",
    "[ sec2d2 ] , we will show how to include resonance decay effects in the definition of the emission function , thus allowing us to explore the corresponding effects induced by these resonance decay contributions to the extracted hbt radii .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ sec3 ] , we will present some of the numerical results obtained using our code , and show how these results compare with the results of previous theoretical hbt analyses .",
    "the formalism needed for the application of hbt interferometry @xcite to relativistic heavy - ion collisions ( a.k.a .",
    "femtoscopy ) is well established , and the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews . for a self - contained presentation",
    "we review here briefly only the most essential definitions and relations .",
    "the fundamental object of hbt interferometry is the two - particle momentum correlation function among pairs of particles from a single collision event , @xmath6 even at large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies the number of particle pairs emitted from a single collision is , however , not large enough to measure this correlation function as a function of all six momentum components with adequate statistical precision . instead of eq .",

    "fortunately , it is possible to account for these interactions in the experimental construction of the correlation function @xcite .",

    "the four - vectors @xmath10 and @xmath18 are orthogonal : @xmath19 the set of parameters @xmath20 in the exponent of eq .",
    "are known as the hbt radius parameters ( or `` hbt radii '' in short ) .",
    "they may be thought of as length scales characterizing the  homogeneity regions \" within the emitting source from which particle pairs with pair momentum @xmath21 @xcite are emitted .",
    "the gaussian parametrization is exact for emission functions with a gaussian space - time structure .",
    "it is adequate even for non - gaussian sources as long as their deviations from gaussian structure are generated by additional length scales that are very different from the source radii .",
    "such additional length scales may be generated , for instance , by extremely long - lived resonances ( e.g. , the @xmath22 meson ) whose decays contribute to the final pion yield but are spread over a much larger region than the directly emitted pions .",
    "these long - lived resonances lead to a sharp peak in the correlation function near @xmath9 which is unresolvably narrow from an experimental standpoint .",
    "the experimental correlation function thus features only the much wider ( in @xmath10 ) structure associated with directly emitted pions and those from short - lived resonance decays @xcite , while the contribution from long - lived resonances is invisible in the correlation function and thereby apparently reduces its value at @xmath23 .",

    "_ distinguishing between one - dimensional and three - dimensional gaussian fits . _ in principle , there are different ways of fitting of the correlation function .",
    "one - dimensional fits are performed along a slice of the correlation function along some axis in @xmath10-space . by construction ,",
    "such a fit optimally represents just this slice in a gaussian form , without constraints from other directions in @xmath10-space .",
    "by contrast , a three - dimensional fit must represent not just the correlation function slices along each axis in @xmath10-space , but must also fit as closely as possible points which lie off - axis as well .",
    "one - dimensional and three - dimensional fits therefore yield somewhat different results , and it is crucial to recognize that only the latter correspond to the most general , three - dimensional hbt analyses which experimentalists perform @xcite .",

    "the three - dimensional fit must therefore fit a proportionately much larger number of @xmath10-bins at large , off - axis values of @xmath10 than at small , on - axis values of @xmath10 .",

    "for each parent resonance @xmath64 ( at fixed @xmath212 and @xmath213 ) , we order the fluid cells in the freeze - out surface by the magnitude of their emission function weight @xmath210 , and compute the full , unweighted integral @xmath218 as we evaluate this integral , we flag the fluid cell ( in the ordered list of all fluid cells ) which corresponds to when some pre - specified fraction of the total integral has been reached , and do this for several different fractions of the total . more precisely , we introduce a set of fractional thresholds @xmath219 which are defined by the following expression : @xmath220 here , the @xmath221 notation implies a sum over only the fluid cells needed to reach the fractional threshold @xmath219 .",

    "this kind of extrapolation provides at best only a reasonable approximation to the exact result .",

    "the authors of @xcite additionally showed that using linear extrapolation to approximate the contribution to the yield from the remaining resonances offered an efficient method for obtaining estimates of the true @xmath231 spectra and anisotropic flow coefficients with all resonance contributions included . since the vast majority of final state resonance decay pions come from a relatively small number of parent resonances , this approach offered a significantly faster way of numerically evaluating heavy - ion observables in the context of event - by - event hydrodynamic simulations .    in this paper",
