    "the idea of self - organized criticality ( soc ) was introduced to describe the behavior of a class of extended dissipative dynamical systems which naturally evolve to a critical state , consisting of avalanches propagating through the system @xcite . from the very beginning",
    "it was observed that this new idea has some connections with ordinary critical phenomena @xcite .",
    "more recently a novel mean field ( mf ) analysis of soc was presented , which pointed out similarities between soc models and models with absorbing states @xcite .",
    "directed percolation ( dp ) @xcite is one of the simplest and most recurrent models with absorbing states . under very general guidelines ( locality , scalar variable , etc . )",
    "it has been proposed that a wide range of models would fall into dp universality class @xcite .",
    "alhouh soc models do not belong to the dp universality class they have some connection with dp @xcite .",
    "recently , tdic and dhar have shown that a class of stochastic sandpile model has some analogy with dp @xcite .",
    "they studied a directed sandpile model in which unstable sites topples with probability @xmath0 .",
    "they observed that above a critical threshold @xmath1 the system shows soc , while below the system is not critical .",
    "the critical probability was identified with the threshold for dp in a squared lattice and the scaling exponents were obtained in terms of dp exponents . however , they could not give a detailed description of the phase diagram of the model , since their analysis was limited to the soc regime above @xmath1 , while the state below @xmath1 could not be characterized .",
    "following the work of tdic and dhar we study a class of stochastic sandpile models with undirected toppling rule .",
    "as in their model , sites topples with a probability @xmath0 but now grains are distributed to each nearest neighbor . in order to provide a theoretical description of the model we have generalized the mf theory by vespignani and zapperi @xcite including the control parameter @xmath0 . in this way",
    "we obtain the complete phase diagram of the model .",
    "the existence of a critical probability @xmath1 and a quasi - stationary state below @xmath1 are obtained .",
    "based on the mf analysis and on the evolution rules we argue that the state below @xmath1 is similar to dp , but with different boundary conditions . using this hypothesis we apply the scaling theory developed for dp to the present stochastic sandpile model .",
    "numerical simulations in one dimension support our hypothesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : mf ]",
    "we introduce the dynamical evolution rules for the stochastic version of the bak - tang - wiesenfeld ( btw ) model .",
    "we perform a single site mf approximation and determine the average densities in the stationary state .",
    "it is found that the driving rate @xmath2 and @xmath0 are the only control parameters and that the system is critical in the line segment ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "then in section [ sec : scaling ] we argument the connection with dp and derive some scaling relations . in order to test our predictions",
    "we have performed numerical simulations in one dimension , the main results are presented in section [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "finally , the summary and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we study a stochastic sandpile model defined as follows . an integer variable @xmath5 ( height or energy )",
    "is assigned to each site of a @xmath6-dimensional lattice and energy is added to the system at rate @xmath2 . when a site receives a grain and its energy exceeds a threshold @xmath7 then , with probability @xmath0 , it relaxes according to the following rules @xmath8 and @xmath9 at each of @xmath10 nearest neighbors .",
    "open boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "one may call this model non - abelian sandpile model with stochastic rules .",
    "the non - abelian behavior makes it different from other stochastic models such as the manna model @xcite .",
    "however , we will simply call it stochastic sandpile model .    the first step towards a comprehensive understanding of critical phenomena",
    "is provided by mean - field ( mf ) theory , which gives insight into the fundamental physical mechanism of the problem .",
    "thus , we start analyzing the stochastic sandpile model through a mf approach . with this simple picture",
    "we introduce the connection with directed percolation .",
    "the first mf theory for sandpile models was introduced by tang and bak @xcite , and only deterministic toppling rules were considered .",
    "latter caldarelli _",
    "et al _ @xcite generalize this mf theory to sandpile models with certain degree of stochasticity in the toppling rules .",
    "in particular caldarelli _",
    "et al _ studied sandpile models where @xmath0 is a function of @xmath5 , such that @xmath11 below the critical threshold @xmath7 and @xmath12 above .",
    "their mf theory and further numerical simulations reveals that the stochastic rules , introduced in this way , changes the average of @xmath13 but does not destroy the critical state @xcite . in the sandpile models analyzed by caldarelli _",
    "et al _ @xmath0 is not a control parameter , its average value is determined by the system dynamics . in these models the system self",
    "- organizes itself to a stationary sate , where @xmath14 is such that the system remains in a critical state . on the contrary in the stochastic sandpile model considered here",
    "@xmath0 is a control parameter .",
    "it is expected that for sufficiently small values of @xmath0 the critical state will be destroyed .",
    "we have therefore to develop a mf theory where @xmath0 appears explicitly as a control parameter .",
    "recently vespignani and zapperi @xcite have introduced a more general framework . as a difference with previous theories ,",
    "their mf approach is not based in some particular sandpile model but in general considerations which are common to all of them , even extendible to other soc models @xcite . within this formalism",
    ", soc appears as a special case of nonequilibrium critical phenomena .",
    "they have divided the states each site can assume in stable ( @xmath15 ) , critical ( @xmath16 ) , and active ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "stable sites are those that can not become active by addition of energy , critical sites are those that become active by addition of energy and active sites are relaxing and transfer energy to their neighbors .",
    "these definitions becomes very clear in a deterministic sandpile model .",
    "for instance ( assuming negligible the probability that a site receives two energy grains ) sites with @xmath18 are stable , those with @xmath19 are critical and those with @xmath20 are active .",
    "however , in the stochastic model sites with @xmath21 topple with probability @xmath0 .",
    "again sites with @xmath18 are stable since they can never become active after receiving one energy grain .",
    "nevertheless , those with @xmath22 have not a well defined state .",
    "for instance , sites with @xmath19 may topple after receiving one energy grain and , therefore , they can not be stable . however , they are not strictly critical because only a fraction @xmath0 of them will topples after receiving a grain of energy .",
    "hence , in the case of stochastic sandpile models the subdivision in stable , critical and active does not covert all the possible states each site can assume , i.e. @xmath23 .    we divide the states each site can assume in stable ( @xmath15 ) , unstable",
    "( @xmath24 ) , and active ( @xmath17 ) and denote their average densities by @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the definition of stable and actives sites is the same considered by vespignani y zapperi , while unstable sites are now those sites that _ may _ become active by addition of energy . under these definitions , sites with @xmath18",
    "are stable , those with @xmath19 are unstable and those with @xmath28 may be either unstable or active .",
    "only a fraction @xmath0 of the unstable sites will become active after receiving energy and , therefore , are critical sites , i.e. @xmath29 this equality makes the connection between our mf approach and that of vespignani and zapperi @xcite . in the deterministic limit @xmath30",
    "there is no distintion between critical and unstable sites .    to study the dynamics of the stochastic sandpile model we consider the following markov process for the average densities @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the transition rates from the state @xmath33 to the state @xmath34 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:0 ] ) . by definition of the model , in one step stable sites never becomes active and unstable sites never become stable , i.e. @xmath35 . @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the fraction of active sites that becomes stable after relaxing . in deterministic models",
    "@xmath38 may be assumed equal to one @xcite .",
    "however in stochastic models @xmath13 may take values large enough compared with @xmath7 in such a way that an active site main become unstable after relaxing , i.e. @xmath39 . although an active site with @xmath40 may remain active due to addition of energy this type of transitions are of second order , they can be neglected for @xmath27 and @xmath2 small .",
    "the transition rates @xmath41 and @xmath42 depends on the probability per unit time that a site receives energy .",
    "if @xmath27 and @xmath2 are small then the probability per unit time that a site receives more than one grain of energy is negligible , and the probability per unit time that a site receive a grain of energy may be approximated by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the effective number of nearest neighbors and @xmath45 is the dissipation rate per toppling event , an effective parameter which account for boundary dissipation . if @xmath24 ( @xmath0 ) is the fraction of stable ( unstable ) sites that become unstable ( active ) after receiving a grain of energy then @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "taking into account these considerations the system of differential eqs .",

    "( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the system of equations is completed by the equation of energy balance @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the total energy of the system , @xmath54 is the average influx of energy and @xmath55 the average outflux of energy .      in the stationary state ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) from eqs .",

    "the differences appear in the density of stable and unstable sites , which now depends on the new control parameter @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath61 we have @xmath62 , @xmath63 and , therefore , there is not any inconsistency in the stationary solutions obtained above .",
    "in this range of @xmath0 , within the mf approach , there is no distinction between the critical state of stochastic and deterministic sandpile models .",
    "the model is critical in the double limit @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite and the susceptibility , @xmath66 diverges in the critical state . for a small perturbation around the subcritical state @xmath67 , @xmath68 and from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) one obtains @xmath69 in agreement with the result obtained for deterministic models @xcite .    from eqs .",
    "( [ eq:9 ] ) and ( [ eq:10 ] one may think that @xmath45 is a control parameter of the model .",
    "however , if the dissipation takes place only at the boundary then @xmath45 will decrease with decreasing system size , because the number of actives sites in the bulk grows faster than the number of active sites at the boundary .",
    "hence , we are just dealing with a finite size effect .",
    "the statement the system is not in a critical state is equivalent to the statement there is no critical state in a finite system .",
    "if dissipation takes place only at the boundary @xmath45 is not a control parameter , it just reflects a finite size effect which at the same time is a necessary condition to obtain a stationary state . in this sense",
    "the criticality here is different from the criticality at phase transitions where boundary effects always disappear in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .    on the contrary ,",
    "the driving field @xmath2 is actually a control parameter . since @xmath2 must satisfy @xmath70 and @xmath71 when",
    "@xmath72 then we must fine tune @xmath2 to zero in order to obtain criticality in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the time scale separation becomes a necessary condition for criticality .",
    "now if we assumes separation of time scales then @xmath0 will be the only control parameter of the model .",

    "however , when @xmath78 critical sites are a fraction @xmath51 of unstable sites .",

    ", we found a critical probability @xmath1 above which the system is in a soc state , while it is in a subcritical state below .",
    "@xmath76 is the probability that a site becomes active after receiving a grain of energy . in the absence of an external field",

    "the only different is found in the boundary conditions , while in dp the system is assumed infinite here we deal with a finite system with open boundaries .",
    "this picture is better represented in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .      according to the mf theory below the @xmath1",
    "there are no stable sites and the fraction of critical sites is given by @xmath104 .",
    "the evolution rules are thus that of dp",
    ". the existence of different boundary conditions may carry as a consequence that some scaling exponents result different , however the nature of the phenomena is the same . for instance , dp near a wall reveals that the correlation length exponents are identical to those obtained in dp in an infinite lattice @xcite , but other exponents take different values .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that in dp near a wall the avalanches are a subset of the avalanches in dp in an infinite lattice .",
    "we thus expect a similar behavior in the stochastic sandpile model below @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", avalanches starting far from the boundary behaves as in dp in an infinite lattice , while avalanches starting near the boundary behaves like the avalanches in dp near a wall .",
    "hence , the correlation lengths and the correlation length exponents are identical to those of dp in an infinite lattice , i.e. @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are the spatial and temporal correlation lengths , respectively , and @xmath108 and @xmath109 the correlation length exponents .    on the other hand , based on this analogy with dp we write the following scaling relation for the average density of active sites at site @xmath110 and time @xmath111 , given a site was active in the origin @xmath112 at @xmath113 , @xmath114 first introduced by grassberger and de la torre in the contest of dp @xcite .",
    "here @xmath115 is a scaling exponent and @xmath13 the dynamic scaling exponent , as it is usually defined in the contest of critical phenomena .",
    "moreover , the probability that the avalanche survive up to time @xmath111 is given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is another scaling exponent . from eq .",

    "we assume that the scaling laws in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:31]-[eq:33 ] ) are also valid above @xmath1 , but with @xmath125 . in this region",
    "the dynamical evolution is independent of @xmath0 and the characteristic length and time depends only on the lattice size @xmath126 , according to @xmath127 however , as it is shown below , for @xmath128 the global conservation introduces a constraint between the exponents @xmath115 and @xmath13 .",
    "let us calculate the average flux of energy @xmath129 outside an sphere of radius @xmath130 , given a grain of energy was added at the origin @xmath131 at @xmath113 . the energy flux is proportional to the gradient of the average density of active sites and , therefore , @xmath132 substituting the scaling relation for @xmath133 ( [ eq:31 ] ) in this expression it results that @xmath134 now , conservation implies that @xmath135 for @xmath136 and , therefore , @xmath137 this scaling relation may seem unusual , a more familiar expression is obtained if one calculate the mean avalanche size @xmath138 this scaling relation was previously obtained by dhar @xcite but for a particular sandpile model .",
    "we have here demonstrated , using scaling arguments , that it holds for any sandpile model with global conservation .      in the directed stochastic models",
    "there is a preferent direction @xmath139 for the avalanche evolution .",
    "this preferent spatial direction may be identified with the time direction in undirected models and then apply the scaling theory developed above .",
    "this means that the scaling relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:31]-[eq:33 ] ) are also valid for directed models , but now @xmath110 is a ( @xmath140)-dimensional vector in the space of the non - preferent directions and @xmath111 gives the evolution in the preferent direction @xmath139 .",
    "another important difference between undirected and directed models is the place where topling take places during the evolution of the avalanche . in the undirected model not only the sites in the avalanche front but also sites inside this front",
    "may be active , transfering energy to their neighbors .",
    "on the contrary in directed models all active sites are in the avalanche front , i.e. at step @xmath111 all active sites are in the layer @xmath141 . moreover , actives sites in layer @xmath139 transfer energy only to those neighbors in layer @xmath142 .",
    "hence , in directed models the energy flux take places following the preferent direction , while it take places in all directions in the undirected case .",
    "an inmediate consequence of this difference is that in directed models the average outflux of energy from the @xmath141 to the @xmath142 layer , which is proportional to the average number of active sites in the @xmath141 layer , equals one and , therefore , @xmath143 then , form eq .",
    "( [ eq:33 ] ) one obtains that @xmath144 the energy balance thus leads to a different constraint for the set of scaling exponents @xmath145 , i.e. the directed model is in a diferent universality class .",
    "in order to test our predictions we have performed numerical simulations of the stochastic sandpile model in one dimension .",
    "we have investigated both regimes of the phase diagram , the region similar to dp below @xmath1 and the soc region above . in both regions",
    "we start with a flat pile , i.e. zero height in all sites , and let the system evolve to the stationary state .",
    "above @xmath1 the stationary state is characterized by a constant average energy per site , which was taken as the stationary condition .",
    "below @xmath1 the energy increases linearly with time and , therefore , we look for another criterion of stationarity . according to the mf theory in the quasi - stationary state below @xmath1 we have @xmath82 , which was taken as the stationary condition . in all cases we start measuring after the system reached the stationary state .",
