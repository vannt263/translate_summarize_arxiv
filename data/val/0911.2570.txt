    "- workers have found that these convective flows appear similar to the upper part of convective rolls proposed by danielson ( 1961 ) , with an upflow at the filament s center that turns into downflowing lanes at its edges .",
    "the measured speed of these motions is about @xmath0 .",
    "superposed to this convective flow is the evershed flow , with typical speeds of about @xmath1 , although much larger values have been reported ( del toro iniesta et al .",
    "2001 ; penn et al . 2003 ; bellot rubio et al . 2004",
    "; borrero et al . 2005 ; snchez almeida 2005 ) .",
    "recent 3d mhd simulations ( scharmer et al . 2008a ; rempel et al . 2009 ) suggest a relation between these two velocity fields , with the evershed flow being formed by the deflection of the convective flow along the horizontal magnetic field inside penumbral filaments .",
    "+ it is also well established that as the observer s line - of - sight penetrates through the penumbral ambient field and into the penumbral filament , the magnetic inclination and line - of - sight velocity undergo large variations .",
    "these are widely accepted as being responsible for creating the anomalous ( i.e. asymmetric or even multi - lobed ) polarization profiles observed in the penumbra ( snchez almeida & lites 1992 , solanki & montavon 1993 ; see solanki 2003 for a review ) .",
    "models incorporating such variations have successfully reproduced the azimuthal and center - to - limb variation of the net circular polarization ( ncp ) in visible and infrared fe i lines ( snchez almeida 1996 , 2005 ; martnez pillet 2000 , 2001 ; schlichenmaier & collados 2002 ; schlichenmaier et al .",
    "2002 ; mller et al .",
    "2002 ; borrero et al .",
    "+ however , the effect that the newly - discovered convective component of the velocity field inside penumbral filaments has on the net circular polarization ( azimuthal and center - to - limb variation ) has not been studied .",
    "the convective flow can potentially have important consequences for the ncp observed at disk center , or at all disk positions at locations perpendicular to the line - of - symmetry of the sunspot . in both cases",
    "the evershed flow is almost perpendicular to the line - of - sight , which should enhance the contribution of the convective flow .",
    "furthermore , the ncp generated by the convective flow could be detected by spectropolarimeters operating at extremely high spatial resolution ( scharmer et al .",
    "2008b ) and it could be related to the non - zero ncp observed at the edges of penumbral filaments ( ichimoto et al .",
    "2008 ) .    in this paper",
    "we address this possibility and study the effect of the combined magnetic and convective flow pattern reported by zakharov et al . inside penumbral filaments , on the azimuthal and center - to - limb variations of the net circular polarization in sunspot penumbrae .",
    "we will adopt a 2.5d model for penumbral filaments similar to that of scharmer & spruit ( 2006 ) and borrero ( 2007 ) .",
    "we assume that the properties of the filament do not change along its axis , i.e. directed radially outwards in the sunspot ( @xmath2-axis ) . therefore we can restrict ourselves to the xz plane . in this plane",
    "the filament is located at the bottom of the domain : @xmath3 .",
    "hereafter we employ the indexes f and s to refer to the filament and its surroundings , respectively .",
    "the filament s boundary has a semi - circular shape of radius @xmath4 . using polar coordinates ( @xmath5,@xmath6 ) , the magnetic field vector for the filament s interior , @xmath7 , and its",
    "surroundings @xmath8 are prescribed as follows :    @xmath9    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the strength and inclination ( with respect to the @xmath13-axis ) of the surrounding magnetic field far away from the tube ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "@xmath15 refers to the magnetic field inside the penumbral filament , which we assume to be aligned with the filament s axis and homogeneous .",
    "we do not attempt to model what happens below @xmath16 and therefore , throughout this paper , the polar angle coordinate is constrained to @xmath17 $ ] ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "following spruit & scharmer ( 2006 ) we have adopted a potential configuration for the surrounding magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "similarly , the velocity field is prescribed as follows :    @xmath18    @xmath19    where @xmath20 refers to the evershed flow ( radial flow along the @xmath2-axis ) . superposed to it ,",
    "we allow for the possibility of a convective flow pattern in the xz plane .",
    "the radial , @xmath21 , and angular @xmath22 components of the convective velocity flow are given by :    @xmath23    @xmath24}^{-1 }   \\bigg{\\{}\\frac{\\partial(r v_r)}{\\partial r } \\cro \\\\ & \\left[\\rho_0\\left(\\theta-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)+\\alpha r \\cos\\theta\\right ] + r v_r \\bigg{[}\\alpha\\cos\\theta + \\\\ & \\frac{r\\rho_0}{2 h\\sur^2}\\left(\\theta-\\frac{\\pi}{2}-\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta \\right)\\bigg{]}\\bigg{\\ } } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 refers to the density in the surrounding atmosphere at @xmath3 : @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be written as :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 represents the sun s gravitational acceleration at the surface ( @xmath31 cm s@xmath32 ) and @xmath33 is the density scale height for the surrounding atmosphere in which the filament is embedded . the value of @xmath34 in eq .",
    "5 can be chosen to allow for a more rapid / slow drop of the radial ( in the xz plane ) velocity profile within the penumbral filament . in our case",
    "we have chosen it such that @xmath35 .",
    "this ensures that at @xmath36 , @xmath37 . thus @xmath38 can be identified with the magnitude of the convective upflow at the filament s center .",
    "the complicated functional dependence of the velocity field comes from the fact that is has been derived fully analytically under the following constraints : ( a ) mass conservation inside the filament : @xmath39 ; ( b ) hydrostatic equilibrium inside the filament : @xmath40 ; ( c ) total pressure balance between the filament and its magnetic surrounding ; and ( d ) the overall configuration must be convective - like .",
    "the rather tedious derivation of @xmath41 is described in the appendix of this paper .    the resulting flow pattern inside the filament in the xz plane is presented in figure 1 , where it can be seen that it features an upflow at the filament s center , with downflowing lanes at the filament s edges .",
    "this convective pattern resembles the flows inside penumbral filaments in the simulations from heinemann et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and rempel et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , as well as the pattern deduced from observations by zakharov et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .        our model can be used to mimic the magnetostatic solutions for the gappy penumbral model presented by scharmer & spruit ( 2006 )",
    ". this can be achieved by simply reducing the magnetic field inside the filament until it becomes a field - free gap @xmath42 .",
    "it can also mimic the classical flux - tube picture ( borrero 2007 ; borrero et al .",
    "2007 ) by removing the convective flow inside the filament @xmath43 .",
    "the later two papers will be hereafter referred to as papers i and ii .",
    "once the velocity and magnetic field have been prescribed , we can obtain the pressure and density stratification of the surrounding atmosphere , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , from a tabulated atmosphere .",
    "here we use the hot umbral model from collados et al .",
    "( 1994 ; other models are discussed in sect .",
    "note that , since the external magnetic field is potential , the adopted pressure and density stratification are also valid everywhere outside the filament .",
    "the boundary layer between the filament and the surrounding field is located at @xmath46 ( in polar and cartesian coordinates , respectively ) and denoted by a @xmath47 throughout this paper . at this boundary",
    "the following relation links the external and internal gas pressures :    @xmath48    this equation is valid irrespective of the external and internal velocity and magnetic fields , as long as their radial components vanish at the filament s boundary : @xmath49 . as in paper i , we can take derivatives with respect to @xmath6 in eq .",
    "9 and apply the @xmath6-component of the momentum equation .",
    "this yields the following relation for the density across the filament s boundary :    @xmath50    note that the velocity we have prescribed ( eq .  6 ) satisfies @xmath51 . therefore eq .  10 can be simplified into :    @xmath52}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    these boundary conditions must be applied , together with the general stationary momentum equation , in order to obtain the pressure and density structure inside the filament :    @xmath53    in this equation ( ideal mhd without viscosity ) the left - hand - side term corresponds to the advection term , where the right - hand - side terms correspond to the gas pressure gradient , the lorentz force and the gravity , respectively . since the magnetic field inside the filament is constant ( eq .",
    "2 ) , the lozentz force ( @xmath54 ) plays no role in the pressure and density equilibrium for @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , the convective velocities are much smaller than the sound speed : @xmath21 , @xmath56   ( see ichimoto et al . 2007 ; zakharov et al .",
    "2008 ) and therefore the advection term can be neglected .",
    "this yields a pressure and density balance that conforms with hydrostatic equilibrium inside the filament : @xmath40 .",
    "the horizontal ( @xmath57-axis ) component of this equation yields the pressure .",
    "once it is obtained , the vertical ( @xmath13-axis ) component of the momentum equation gives the density :    @xmath58 } \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath59    figure 1 shows the density configuration for a penumbral filament and its surroundings , along with the magnetic field lines outside the filament and the convective flow pattern inside it . once the gas pressure and the densities are known , the temperature can be evaluated using the ideal gas law with a variable molecular weight to account for the ionization of the different species . as a result",
    ", we now have the temperature , density , gas pressure , and the velocity and magnetic field vector at every point in the xz plane .",
    "note that our approach to the magneto - hydrostatic equilibrium is slightly different from scharmer & spruit ( 2006 ) .",
    "this yields a different thermodynamic structure . for example , in scharmer & spruit ( 2006 ) the density inside the gap is larger than the density outside by a constant factor at all depths . in our case",
    ", the density difference changes linearly with depth ( eq .  14 ) , and it peaks at the top of the filament while vanishing at @xmath16 .",
    "our approach is also different from the flux - tube mhs equilibrium presented in borrero ( 2007 ) in that we do not model the lower half of the filament , as we do not know if deeper down the filament has the shape of a flux - tube or an elongated plume .",
    "this in turn means that we do not have to deal with possible negative densities in the lower half of the filament as in the flux - tube case ( see eq .  14 in paper i ) .",
    "it also allows us to have an uniform magnetic field inside the filament ( eq .  2 ) .",
    "all these details about the thermodynamics , however , play a secondary role for radiative transfer calculations .",
    "in particular , they are negligible for the net circular polarization since this quantity depends mostly on the magnetic field and velocity configurations .    finally it is also important to mention that equations 2 and 4 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) imply , through the induction equation , that the magnetic field along the filament s axis , @xmath15 , changes in time .",
    "this incovenience could have been avoided by postulating a magnetic field inside the filament that is parallel to the velocity field .",
    "since the magnitude of the evershed effect is much larger than that of the convective velocities : @xmath62 , it immediatelly follows that the magnetic field in the xz plane is much smaller than the magnetic field along the filament axis .",
    "the thermodynamic , kinematic and magnetic configuration for a penumbral filament has been obtained in the previous section in the local reference frame : @xmath63 ( where the @xmath13-axis corresponds to the direction perpendicular to the solar surface ) , but in order to study the azimuthal variation of the net circular polarization at different heliocentric angles we need to place ourselves in the observer s reference frame : @xmath64 , where now the @xmath65-axis points towards the observer . to that end",
    ", we perform a double rotation of the velocity and magnetic field vectors . first a rotation by angle @xmath66 along @xmath67 .",
    "this allows us to place the filament at any azimuthal position within the sunspot .",
    "@xmath68 refers to the line - of - symmetry of the sunspot on the center - side penumbra ( i.e. it points towards the center of the solar disk ) .",
    "secondly , a rotation by angle @xmath69 ( heliocentric angle ) along the resulting @xmath70 .",
    "this allows us to locate the sunspot at any position on the solar disk ( see eq .  1 in paper ii ) . after performing these rotations ,",
    "the inclination of the magnetic field vector with respect to the observer can be obtained as : @xmath71 , the azimuth of the magnetic field in the plane perpendicular to the observer as : @xmath72 , and finally the line - of - sight velocity as : @xmath73 .",
    "the equations describing the ray paths ( lines - of - sight ) along which the radiative transfer equation is to be solved , is given by :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 is the point where the line - of - sight pierces the uppermost boundary of our computational domain .",
    "note that our model is 2.5d which means there are no variations along the filament s axis ( @xmath2-coordinate ) which implies that equation s 16 role",
    "can be simply subtituted by a modification in the optical depth scale as @xmath76 , with @xmath77 . with this information",
    ", we can now calculate the paths of each line - of - sight piercing the xz plane in figure 1 at different @xmath78 s . in our calculations",
    "we use 64 ray - paths with @xmath79 .",
    "the radiative transfer equation is solved using the synthetis module in the sir code ( ruiz cobo & del toro iniesta 1992 ) for each ray path .",
    "stokes @xmath80 profiles as a function of wavelength of two widely used spectral lines : fe i 6302.5    and fe i 15648.5    are computed .",
    "the net circular polarization for each ray , @xmath81 is obtained as the wavelength integral of stokes @xmath80 , with the final ncp ( denoted as @xmath82 ) being the mean over the ray - paths that pierce the filament ( only @xmath83 rays out of 64 ) and @xmath66 .",
    "failing to do this would allow us to arbitrarily change the filling factor at each azimuthal position to create more or less net circular polarization .",
    "note that the same results would be obtained if we assume that there are several filaments lying next to each other within the resolution elements as long as it is fully filled with filaments and they at located at the same height . ]",
    "@xmath84    figure 2 ( top panel ) shows examples ( dashed lines ) of the indiviudal 64 stokes @xmath85 profiles generated by each of the ray paths when looking at a penumbral filament located along the line - of - symmetry in the limbward - side of the penumbra ( @xmath86 ) of a sunspot located at an heliocentric angle of @xmath87 .",
    "only half of the ray - paths actually pierce the filament and produce a non - vanishing ncp ( @xmath83 out of 64 ) . in color we also plot the averaged stokes @xmath80 profiles .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 shows an example of the ncp generated by individual ray - paths ( n@xmath88 ) in the two considered spectral lines , at an heliocentric angle of @xmath89 , and at two different azimuthal angles : @xmath90 ( center side penumbra ) and @xmath86 ( the limb - ward side of the penumbra ) .",
    "this example was obtained using the following model parameters : @xmath91 g , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 km .",
    "+     we have repeated the same calculations for 25 different azimuthal positions between @xmath96 and at 4 heliocentric angles : @xmath97 .",
    "results are presented in figure 3 ( top panel for fe i 6302.5    and bottom panel for fe i 15648.5   ) .",
    "example of theoretical and observed @xmath98-curves are overplotted in figure 4 for two cases : asp ( advanced stokes polarimeter ; elmore et al .",
    "1992 ) observations of fe i 6302.5    at @xmath99 ( ar 8545 ; may 21 , 1999 ) and tip ( tenerife infrared polarimeter ; martnez pillet et al .",
    "1999 ) observations of fe i 15648.5    at @xmath100 ( ar 8706 , september 21 , 1999 ) .",
    "figure 4 clearly demonstrates that the total amount of ncp and its sign are well reproduced as a function of the azimuthal position at the displayed heliocentric angles .",
    "it is particularly gratifying to see the model reproducing the multi - peak shape of the ncp curve of fe i 15648.5  .",
    "the theoretical @xmath98 curves compare satisfactorily with the observed ones also at other heliocentric angles for these two spectral lines ( compare fig .  3 with figs .  3 - 4 of paper ii ) .",
    "+     it is important to mention here that the observed ncp curves have been obtained mainly for points located in the middle penumbra .",
    "it may seem that the model parameters : @xmath91 g and @xmath94 chosen to reproduce them are more typical of the outer penumbra .",
    "this is not the case since these model parameters refer to locations far away from the flux - tube .",
    "in fact , in the vicinity of the flux - tube the field strength and inclination of the external magnetic field reaches values closer to 1500 g and 45@xmath101 respectively ( see for example fig .  1 in paper 1 ) , which is more representative of the mid - penumbra .",
    "as demonstrated in the previous section , the model for penumbral filaments employed here produces very similar @xmath98-curves as the round horizontal flux - tube model employed by borrero et al .",
    "2007 ( see figs .  3 - 4 ) to describe penumbral filaments . in order to understand the reason for this we need to investigate the similarities and differences between our current model for penumbral filaments and the model from paper ii .",
    "+     the magnetohydrostatic equilibrium for horizontal flux - tubes imposes large temperatures in the tube s lower half .",
    "this yields a @xmath102 level that is always formed within the upper middle - half of the flux tube ( see fig .  2 in paper i ) , just as in our fig .  1 .",
    "therefore , the lower half of the flux - tube does not significantly affect the emergent radiation , so that the main difference between the model employed in this work and the horizontal flux - tube model is the addition of the convective flow ( eqs .  3 through 8) .",
    "to investigate the effect that these convective motions have on the generated ncp , we have calculated the ncp produced by individual rays cutting through a penumbral filament ( in the same way as in figure  2 ) but switching off the evershed effect : @xmath103 .",
    "an example is presented in figure 5 for a filament located at disk center ( @xmath104 ) and at the line - of - symmetry of the sunspot ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "we have carried out the experiment for two different convective velocities : @xmath93 ( solid lines ) and @xmath106(dashed lines ) .",
    "note that , in this particular example the results would have been the same even if a horizontal evershed flow was present , @xmath107 ( eq .  4 ) , since it does not contribute to the los - velocity .",
    "according to figure 5 , the amount of ncp does not exactly scale linearly with @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath38 does not necessarily represent the convective velocities seen in spectropolarimetric observations , but rather the strength of the convective upflow at the filament s center ( see discussion in section 2 ) , which is partly hidden below the @xmath102 level ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "for @xmath93   the generated ncp is always smaller than 3 m   ( absolute value ) .",
    "the results for the fe i 6302.5    line show that , at the center of the filament ( where the upflow is present ) the ncp is negative , but it turns positive closer to the filament s edge ( at the downflow lanes ) .",
    "hinode / sp ( ichimoto et al . 2008 ) has not so far provided a clear correlation between convective velocities and ncp in sunspots penumbrae close to disk center in the fe i 6302.5    line , probably due to the limited spatial resolution of the observations , which smears out the ncp variation across the filament .",
    "for fe i 6302.5    this makes the effect of the convective velocity field negligible , since the ncp generated by the upflow cancels out with the ncp generated by the downflowing lanes . due to the @xmath108-mechanism ( mller et al . 2002 )",
    "fe i 15648.5    does not show such a correlation between upflows / downflows and ncp , however , we can see in fig .  5 that the regions with positive net circular polarization are roughly equal to the regions with negative one .",
    "therefore the spatially averaged ncp also tends to cancel out in this near - infrared spectral line .",
    "it is also worth noticing , in figures 2 and 5 , that the curves n@xmath109 are not symmetric even though the filament is located at disk center .",
    "the asymmetry is again due to the @xmath108-mechanism which is affects more the infrared lines ( red curves ) than the visible lines ( blue curves ) .        in figure 6 we present different @xmath98-curves for sunspots located at different heliocentric angles .",
    "the first thing one realizes is that for @xmath104 a flat curve is obtained .",
    "this was to be expected because at disk center it does not matter where the filament is located within the sunspot ( eq .  15 ) .",
    "in addition , the total ncp is very small ( @xmath110 m ) .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous discussion , and is due to the fact that the upflow at the filament s center produces an ncp opposite in sign as the downflowing lanes at its edges , yielding very small values once we calculate the spatial average .",
    "+     the ncp decreases towards the limb along the line - of - symmetry of the spot ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "this is because the projection of the convective velocity field along the observer s line - of - sight decreases , and therefore we expect the ncp at this azimuthal position to decrease with increasing @xmath69 .",
    "note that this is not necessarily the case for regions perpendicular to the line - of - symmetry ( @xmath112 ) since the overturning upflow would become aligned with the observer .",
    "indeed we observe that , for fe i 6302.5    ( fig .",
    "6 ; top panel ) , at @xmath86 and @xmath113 the ncp decreases by a smaller amount with @xmath69 than at @xmath111 . in the case of",
    "fe i 15648.5    ( fig .  6 ; bottom panel ) , the additional contribution of the @xmath108-mechanism produces an increase in the ncp , perpendicular to the line - of - symmetry , as @xmath69 increases",
    ".    we stress that in these experiments we neglected the contribution of the evershed flow ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "if we had included it , its effect would have become larger with increasing @xmath69 , making the effect of @xmath38 even more negligible by comparison .",
    "consequently the ncp generated by convective velocities inside penumbral filaments is easily masked by the lack of spatial resolution , projection effects , and the additional effect of the evershed flow .",
    "finally it is important to bear in mind that the model presented here does not transport any net energy since the temperature in the downflowing lanes is the same as in the central upflow . to test what would happen in a more realistic situation where real convection would be present we have repeated our experiments in this section ( figs .  5 and 6 ) but artificially increasing the temperature in the upflowing lane according to :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 k. this value for @xmath116 has been chosen such that upflows provides sufficient energy to explain a penumbral brightness that is about 70 % of the quiet sun .",
    "note that equation 18 only applies to upflows inside the filament : @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "equation 18 shows that the temperature difference vanishes at the filament s edge , where convective - like motions are no longer present . under this new configuration ,",
    "the results show that the actual shape for the ncp - curve ( figs .  5 - 6 ) in fe",
    "i 6302.5    does not change , whereas for fe i 15648.5    does . on the one hand , these changes are at the level of @xmath119 1 m , which supports our previous claim that the thermodynamic structure plays only a secondary role in the generation of ncp . on the other hand , after modifying the temperature in the upflow , density and gas pressure have not been modifyed in a way that is consistent with the equilibrium of the filament ( eq .  13 - 14 ) , therefore these claims need further investigation with a model that allows for these differences self - consistently .",
    "another model with distinct similarities to the structure we have studied here is the _ gappy penumbral model _ ( spruit & scharmer 2006 ; scharmer & spruit 2006 ) , which postulates that the penumbral filaments are formed by field - free gaps that penetrate the penumbral magnetic field from below . inside such field - free gaps overturning",
    "convective motions occur .",
    "this is an advantadge , as compared to horizonal flux - tube models ( solanki & montavon 1993 ) , since convective motions are able to carry enough energy to heat the penumbra , which in turn could explain its enhanced brightness relative to the umbra ( cf .",
    "schlichenmaier & solanki 2003 ; ruiz cobo & bellot rubio 2008 ) . in the context of the gappy penumbral model",
    ", the evershed flow would be produced by the deflection of these convective motions along the inclined field lines above the gap ( schamer et al .",
    "2008b ) , although it has not yet been shown that in this model the evershed flow would be restricted to material threaded by a magnetic field ( solanki et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in the previous examples ( sects .  3 and 4 ) we have assumed that the magnetic field inside the penumbral filament is as strong as the external field far away from the filament ( @xmath120 g )",
    "however , our model for penumbral filaments would present a very similar configuration , both in the magnetic field and the velocity field , to the gappy penumbral model if we set the field strength inside the filament to zero : @xmath42 . very recently , however , scharmer ( 2008 ) has acknowledged the possibility of a non - zero ( although strongly reduced ) magnetic field inside the _ field - free gap _",
    "brummell et al .",
    "2008 ; rempel et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the azimuthal variation of the ncp , @xmath98 , for a penumbral filament observed away from disk center for various field strengths inside the filament is presented in fig .  7 for fe i 6302.5 ( top panel , for @xmath99 ) and fe i 15648.5    ( bottom panel , for @xmath100 ) .",
    "the case of @xmath121 g is indicated by solid lines in this figure , which are identical to the solid lines in fig .  4 , which reproduce very well the observations .",
    "however , when the field strength inside the filament drops below 1000 g the discrepancy between theoretical and observed curves becomes clear .",
    "similar discrepancies appear also at other heliocentric angles .    in particular , for @xmath122 g , the ncp produced by an almost field - free filament is always negative at all azimuthal angles in both spectral lines , and therefore does not reproduce the correct sign of the ncp .",
    "in addition , the multi - peak structure observed in fe i 15648.5    disappears completely for @xmath122 g , which is contrary to observations .",
    "these computations imply a value of @xmath15 not much below 1000 g , which in agreement with the findings of borrero & solanki ( 2008 ) who found that in the outer penumbra , the magnetic field inside penumbral filaments is not weaker than in the external field .",
    "in order to investigate whether our results are effected by our particular choice of model parameters we have studied the effect of these parameters on the @xmath98 curves . for example , the effect of the inclination of the external field .",
    "the idea behind this is that a smaller @xmath12 increases the gradient in the inclination along the line - of - sight , so that a larger ncp should be generated through the @xmath123-mechanism ( snchez almeida & lites 1992 ) . using @xmath124 indeed increases the amount of ncp ( for",
    "fe i 6305.5    only ) , however it did not have any significant impact on the overall shape of the @xmath98 curves .",
    "we have also employed other models for the external atmosphere . instead of the hot umbral model from collados et al .",
    "( 1994 ) we adopted the mean penumbral model by del toro iniesta et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , which is about 1200 k hotter than the former at @xmath125 and possesses a steeper gradient in temperature . again",
    ", no significant differences were observed , supporting our earlier statement ( sect .",
    "2 ) that the thermodynamic details play only a minor role . of course",
    ", if the thermodynamics change dramatically noticeable differences do appear .",
    "for example , using the cool ( instead of hot ) umbral model from collados et al .",
    "( 1994 ) has the effect of yielding very small , @xmath110 m , values for the net circular polarization in fe i 6302.5  , in clear disagreement with observations .",
    "this happens because this umbral model is very cold and therefore the lower level of the atomic transition depopulates , which produces spectral lines that are far from their saturation point , becoming less sensitive to the gradients along the line - of - sight ( grossmann - doerth et al .",
    "1989 ; borrero et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we have also studied the effects of other possible convective velocity fields .",
    "for example , consider :    @xmath126    this velocity field produces a very similar convective pattern as the one described in eqs .  3 - 8 ( see also fig .  1 ) , but it does not satisfy mass conservation inside the penumbral filament . in spite of this , we have repeated most of the calculations presented in this paper using this velocity field and found that it produces essentially the same results as the more realistic flow that conserves mass .    another parameters that affects the ncp - curves",
    "is the percentage of the resolution element that is assumed to be occupied by the penumbral filament ( filling factor ; see footnote in section 3 ) .",
    "a smaller filling factor will scale the @xmath98-curves proportionally .",
    "however , on the one hand the model parameters we have chosen are meant to model the conditions in the middle - penumbra , where the filling factor of the filament is seen to peak ( see bellot rubio et al .",
    "2004 , borrero et al .",
    "on the other hand a decrease of a 25 % in the filling factor can be compesated by an similar increase in the magnitude of the evershed flow @xmath20 or a decrease in the inclination of the external field @xmath12 ( that increases in the gradient in the inclination of the magnetic field as the line - of - sight passes from the external atmosphere to the inside of the filament ) .",
    "we have developed a magnetohydrostatic model of a penumbral filament embedded in a surrounding potential field .",
    "the mhs equilibrium imposes a density , pressure and temperature structure inside the penumbral filaments such that the @xmath102-level is formed inside the filament .",
    "consequently , we do not need to specify its sub - surface structure , which could be in the form of a flux - tube ( filament with circular cross section ) or in the form of a vertically elongated plume . inside the filament",
    "we assume the presence of the evershed flow along its axis and of a convective velocity field perpendicular to it .",
    "the filament s magnetic field is imposed to be homogeneous in its interior .    by means of stokes radiative transfer calculations ,",
    "we have shown that this model is able to reproduce the observed azimuthal variation of the net circular polarization @xmath98 , observed at different heliocentric angles for two different ( visible and near - infrared ) fe i lines .",
    "we have also studied the effect of the convective velocity field on the generated @xmath98-curves .",
    "we have found that its effect is much smaller than the ncp generated by the evershed flow .",
    "in addition , the ncp generated by the convective downflows ( @xmath127 ) partly cancels with the ncp generated by the upflow at the filament s center ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "finally , we have employed our model to study the ncp generated by field - free gaps ( spruit & scharmer 2006 ) and have found that this model does not reproduce satisfactorily the observed ncp . for that to happen",
    ", the magnetic field inside the filament should be around 1000 g , which is not compatible with the concept of a field - free gap .",
    "our results do not , by themselves , rule out the field - free gap model , since the model employed here is still rather simple , although it does account for the main features of the penumbral fine structure .",
    "a more elaborate model based on field - free gaps could still yield ncp curves closer to the observed ones .    in summary",
    ", our investigation confirms that the net circular polarization is produced mainly by the evershed flow in filaments filled with a rather strong horizontal field , and embedded in an inclined magnetic field , as originally proposed by solanki & montavon ( 1993 ) and worked out in greater detail by martnez pillet ( 2000 ) , mller et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , schlichenmaier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , borrero et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and others .",
    "more elaborate models are already available thanks to recent 3d mhd simulations ( schssler & vgler 2006 , heinemann et al .",
    "2007 , rempel et al . 2008 , 2009 ) . these simulations ,",
    "reveal a complex picture that shares similarities and differences with both the flux - tube and the gappy penumbral model ( see borrero 2009 , schlichenmaier 2009 ) . in a next step",
    "it is important to introduce non - grey radiative energy transfer into such simulations , so that similar analyses as carried out here can be performed .",
    "in this section we derive a velocity field inside penumbral filaments that conforms with mass conservation for a prescribed density and gas pressure stratification inside the filament .",
    "gas pressure and density have been obtained under hydrostatic equilibirum in section 2 of this paper and are given by eqs .  13 and 14 , respectively .",
    "in addition , in order to satisfy the boundary conditions at the filament s boundary ( eqs .  9 - 10 )",
    "the radial and angular component of the velocity field must vanish at the filament s boundary : @xmath129 .",
    "the final requirement is that the velocity flow must be convective , that is , with an upflow at the filament s center and downflowing lanes at its edges .",
    "+ we start by writing down the condition : @xmath130 in polar coordinates . unless otherwise specified we will always refer to the filament and therefore the subindex f is implied throughout this section .                      where @xmath140 is an integration constant that can depend of the radial coordinate . for simplicify we will now make the further assumption that @xmath141 depends only on the radial distance from the filament s center : @xmath142 .",
    "with this , we can simplify eq .",
    "a6 to :          where we have only subtituted @xmath145 and @xmath146 ( eq .  8) .",
    "now , the denstity stratification of the external atmosphere @xmath45 can be written in terms of the density at @xmath3 : @xmath25 and its density scale - height @xmath33 :      in general , the density scale - height varies with height , however , over the range of heights we are interested in : @xmath148 $ ] , @xmath149 can be considered to be constant . when subtituting eq .",
    "a9 into a8 and then into a7 we are left with two integrals that can be solved analitically , in terms of the hypergeometric function @xmath150 , but only if we perform a taylor expansion of the density in the surrounding atmosphere @xmath151 .",
    "fortunately , for typical penumbral conditions we have that @xmath153 . in this case",
    "the term @xmath154 in equation a8 is the main contributor to the filament s density @xmath155 , which in turn means that we can truncate the taylor expansion of @xmath45 ( eq .",
    "a10 ) to include only the first two terms . in this way we can avoid dealing with hipergeometric functions and transform the integrals inside eq .  a7 into :        where @xmath27 and @xmath28 had already been defined in eqs .  7 and 8 in section 2 of the paper . the integration constant @xmath140 in eq .",
    "a7 is determined by imposing that across the center of the filament the velocity field takes the form of an upflow : @xmath158 .",
    "finally , subtituting eqs .",
    "a11 and a12 into a7 yields the final result for @xmath159 given by eq .",
    "note that equations 6 and a7 are completely general as long as the radial component of the velocity field depends only on @xmath5 : @xmath142 .    for the determination of @xmath142 we are free to choose any function that vanishes at the filament s boundary : @xmath160 such that there is total pressure balance between the filament and the surrounding atmosphere ( eq .  9 ) .",
    "our choice of @xmath142 will also affect the functional form of @xmath159 ( through eq .",
    "according to the discussion in section 2 we are looking for solutions that verify : @xmath51 such that the velocity term in eq .",
    "10 disappears .",
    "this is guaranteed if @xmath160 ( which we are already looking for ) but also @xmath161 .",
    "note that our choice of @xmath142 ( eq .  5 ) satisfies both conditions : both @xmath142 and its derivative vanish at the filament s boundary .",
