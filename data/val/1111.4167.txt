    "faraday rotation is a physical phenomenon where the position angle of linearly polarized radiation propagating through a magneto - ionic medium is rotated as a function of frequency .",
    "the work on astrophisical faraday rotation has been initiated in @xcite , and since then several important contributions have been added to this topic @xcite . recently ,",
    "faraday rotation measure ( rm ) synthesis has been re - introduced as an important method for analyzing multichannel polarized radio data , where multiple emitting regions are present along the single line of sight of the observations @xcite . in practice , the method requires the recovery of the faraday dispersion function from measurements restricted to limited wavelength ranges , which is an ill - conditioned deconvolution problem , raising important computational difficulties .",
    "since then , three different approaches have been proposed to solve this problem .",
    "a first approach uses an adaptation of the hogbom clean algorithm @xcite to the rm deconvolution @xcite .",
    "the second approach is wavelet - based , and assumes field symmetries in order to project the observed data onto @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the third approach @xcite is based on the compressed sensing paradigm @xcite .",
    "all these methods are more or less successful in the case of mixed problems , i.e. when both thin and thick components are included in the model . for example , in a recent paper it has been shown that rm synthesis may yield an erroneous faraday structure in the presence of multiple , interfering rm components , even when cleaning of the faraday spectrum is performed @xcite .",
    "also , to our knowledge these methods have not been evaluated in the presence of noise added to the observed data , a situation that makes the deconvolution problem even more difficult .",
    "thus , the development of robust deconvolution methods for the recovery of the faraday dispersion function in a given spectral range becomes crucial for the rm synthesis applications .",
    "inspired by the above mentioned contributions , in this paper we discuss the case of sparse approximation of the complex faraday dispersion function , i.e. we assume that @xmath1 can be approximated by a small number of discrete components , which can be both thin or thick . also , we present the implementation of a greedy deconvolution algorithm , and we illustrate the described method with several numerical simulations which emphasize the effect of the covered range and sampling resolution in the faraday depth space , and the effect of noise on the observed data .",
    "the numerical results show that the described method performs quite well for simple component mixtures , at typical sampling resolution values and coverage range in the faraday depth space , and it is quite robust in the presence of noise .",
    "we show that the described technique is well suited for exploratory data analysis , where prior information about the component distributions is not available , and it can be used as a complement to the previously proposed methods .",
    "although a sparse solution is an idealized model of a complex astrophysical system , the potential complexity of the solutions is adequate for a wide range of astrophysical situations .",
    "the sparseness requirement steers the solution to include the smallest number of components required to fit an observed faraday depth spectrum .",
    "double - lobed radio galaxies that are not resolved by the telescope may experience different faraday rotation in each lobe because the differences in the foreground on scales smaller than the beam .",
    "the lobes themselves may be extended and experience differential faraday rotation as well .",
    "a sparse solution may consist of two discrete faraday components representing each lobe .",
    "if the data are good enough to detect differential faraday rotation across the source , the solution may include one or more components with a finite extent in faraday depth .",
    "complex source structure may be built up out of a dictionary of basic thin and thick faraday components , subject to the requirement that the solution remains sparse .    in the diffuse",
    "interstellar medium , a case where faraday rotation of galactic synchrotron emission is dominated by a single hii region along the line of sight is an example of a system that is well approximated with two components in faraday depth , e.g. the circular faraday screen discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "as in the case of double lobed radio sources , the sparse solution is not limited by two delta functions in faraday depth , as it can increase in complexity if warranted by the data .",
    "the assumption of sparseness may fail in case there is a power on a large range of faraday depths , defined by the minimum and maximum faraday depth detectable in a survey .",
    "this may occur in some supernova remnants with complex structure and strong magnetic fields .",
    "in this section we give a brief description of the faraday rm synthesis problem , following the formulation introduced in @xcite .",
    "the faraday rotation is characterized by the faraday depth ( in @xmath2 ) , which is defined as:@xmath3 where @xmath4 is the electron density ( in @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 is the magnetic field ( in @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8 is the infinitesimal path length ( in parsecs ) .",
    "we also define the complex polarization as:@xmath9 where @xmath10 is the fractional polarization , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 are the stokes parameters , and @xmath14 is the polarization angle observed at wavelength @xmath15:@xmath16 the faraday rm is defined as the derivative of the polarization angle @xmath14 , with respect to @xmath17 : @xmath18    we now identify rm with the faraday depth @xmath19 , and we assume that the observed polarization @xmath20 originates from the emission at all possible values of @xmath19 , such that : @xmath21 where @xmath1 is the complex faraday dispersion function ( the intrinsic polarized flux , as a function of the faraday depth ) .",
    "thus , in principle @xmath1 is the inverse fourier transform of the observed quantity @xmath20:@xmath22 however , this operation is ill - defined since we can not observe @xmath20 for @xmath0 , and also in practice the observations are limited to an interval @xmath23 $ ] .    in order to deal with the above limitations ,",
    "the observed polarization is defined as:@xmath24 where @xmath25 is the observation window function , with @xmath26 for @xmath27 $ ] , and @xmath28 otherwise .",
    "therefore , we obtain the reconstructed dispersion function:@xmath29 where @xmath30^{-1},\\ ] ] is the normalization constant for the observation window . the reconstructed dispersion function",
    "can also be written as:@xmath31 where @xmath32 is the convolution operator , and@xmath33 is the rm spread function ( rmsf ) .    using the shift theorem , we can also write:@xmath34 and@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the mean of the sampled values in @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "the goal of the analysis is to find @xmath1 from the observed values @xmath37",
    "( i.e. @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) over @xmath40 discrete channels @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath42 , with the given weights @xmath43 .",
    "since the measured values are discrete ( each value constitutes an integral over the channel centered at @xmath44 ) , we should consider the discrete versions of the above equations , i.e. : @xmath45 and respectively @xmath46 the reconstructed function @xmath47 depends on the window @xmath48 , which acts as a filter , and improves substantially by increasing its coverage in the @xmath17 space .",
    "obviously , @xmath47 is a `` dirty '' reconstruction of @xmath1 , i.e. the convolution of @xmath1 with @xmath49 , and and a deconvolution step is necessary to recover @xmath1 .",
    "in general , the number of data points is limited by the number of independent measurement channels , and therefore there are many different potential faraday dispersion functions consistent with the measurements @xcite . the usual approach to resolving such ambiguities ,",
    "is to impose some extra constraints on the faraday dispersion function .",
    "our approach is based on the recently introduced framework of compressive sensing @xcite .",
    "compressive sensing relies on the observation that many types of signals can be well - approximated by a sparse expansion in terms of a suitable basis , or dictionary of functions .",
    "the main idea of compressive sensing is that if the signal is sparse , then a small number of measurements contain sufficient information for its approximate or exact recovery . in our case ,",
    "the problem is to reconstruct a sparse @xmath1 from a relatively small number of @xmath50 measurements .",
    "therefore , we assume that the model of @xmath1 is sparse in an over - complete dictionary of functions . by over - complete",
    "we understand that the number of functions in the dictionary is larger than the number of independent observation channels .",
    "thus , the dictionary functions may be redundant ( linearly dependent ) , and therefore non - orthogonal . in order to give a proper formulation of this approach we need to introduce a discrete representation of the @xmath19 space .",
    "it is known @xcite that , for a discrete sampled faraday dispersion function , the full width at half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the width of the observation interval .",
    "also , using a uniform grid in @xmath17 space one can estimate the maximum observable faraday depth by : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the width of an observing channel @xcite .",
    "this estimation of @xmath55 is only an approximation , since in reality only the frequency @xmath56 is sampled linearly .",
    "therefore , in our discrete representation we consider a nonlinear grid in the @xmath17 space : @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the centered frequency of the channel @xmath42 , and @xmath59 is the speed of light .",
    "also , we consider a linear grid in the @xmath19 space , where the computational window @xmath60 , the sampling resolution @xmath61 , and the number of points @xmath62 are set to : @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the integer part of @xmath65",
    ".    the model of @xmath1 is therefore characterized by a uniform grid , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and a vector @xmath68\\in\\mathbb{\\mathbb{c}}^{m}$ ] , which is assumed sparse , i.e. it has a small number of non - zero components , corresponding to the complex amplitudes of the sources located on the @xmath69 grid .",
    "for example , a thin source with the amplitude @xmath70 , located at @xmath69 , will be approximated by the product of @xmath70 with a dirac function @xmath71 , while a thick source will be characterized by a contiguous set of non - zero amplitudes in the vector @xmath72 , which requires a different set of adaptive functions , capable of capturing their position and extensive support in the @xmath19 space .",
    "the goal of the analysis is to find the vector @xmath72 , which is a discrete approximation of the faraday dispersion function @xmath1 , from the measurements @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath42 .      since , in general we can have @xmath73 , the dirac functions @xmath71 , @xmath67 , form an over - complete dictionary in the @xmath19 space .",
    "the decomposition of @xmath1 with respect to the dirac over - complete dictionary is:@xmath74 from the equations ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) we obtain : @xmath75 we observe that the transformation of @xmath1 into @xmath50 can be written in a matrix form as following:@xmath76 where @xmath77^{t}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{n},\\ ] ] is the @xmath40-dimensional complex vector of observations , and @xmath78 is the @xmath79 matrix with the fourier terms:@xmath80 and @xmath25 is the @xmath81 diagonal matrix , with the diagonal elements equal with the channel weights : @xmath82 .",
    "if we are searching for the sparsest solution possible , then the @xmath83 norm of @xmath72 : @xmath84 @xmath85 should be minimized .",
    "this sparseness assumption leads to the following optimization problem:@xmath86 however , finding the minimum @xmath83 norm is an np - complete problem , which requires a combinatorial search of the parameter space and therefore is practically unfeasible @xcite .",
    "a better approach is to replace the @xmath83 norm with the @xmath87 norm:@xmath88 which transforms the combinatorial problem into a convex problem , that can be solved in polynomial time @xcite , and it has been shown to give solutions close to the @xmath83 norm solutions @xcite .",
    "thus , the problem can be reformulated as finding the vector @xmath72 such that:@xmath89 one can see that we do not make any assumption on the number of non - zero components , we just assume that their number is smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "so far we have not considered the influence of noise on the observed data .",
    "we assume a complex noise vector @xmath90 , with the components @xmath91 having the real and respective imaginary parts sampled from a normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation @xmath92 : @xmath93 .",
    "thus , the transformation of @xmath1 into @xmath50 can be rewritten as:@xmath94 and the minimization problem can be reformulated as:@xmath95 the use of the @xmath87 norm induces sparsity in @xmath72 , while the constraint ensures @xmath96 .",
    "since @xmath97 is observed in the presence of noise , it is reasonable to not enforce @xmath98 exactly , and to stop the minimization process when the norm of the residual becomes comparable with the standard deviation of the noise ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "dirac functions can be used to approximate thin sources only . in orderdonoho2006 to approximate thick sources we extend the dictionary by incorporating a set of functions , characterized by adaptive translation and scaling properties , such that they are capable to capture the position and the extent of thick sources in the @xmath19 space .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath1 has a sparse approximation in an over - complete dictionary @xmath100 of functions @xmath101 , called atoms @xcite : @xmath102 here , @xmath103 is the number of atoms in the dictionary , and only a small number of the complex coefficients @xmath104 are assumed to be non - zero .",
    "thus , by introducing the @xmath105 complex matrix @xmath106 , with the elements @xmath107 , and the sparse complex vector @xmath108^{t}\\in\\mathbb{c}^{j}$ ] , and taking into account that : @xmath109 we obtain the following minimization problem:@xmath110 where@xmath111 is a @xmath112 complex matrix . in this more general case ,",
    "the goal is to find the sparse vector @xmath113 in the dictionary space .",
    "obviously , when the dictionary is reduced to the dirac basis we have @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath11 is the @xmath117 identity matrix , and therefore @xmath118 reduces to the weighted fourier matrix , @xmath119",
    ".      we should note that an over - complete dictionary @xmath100 that leads to sparse representations can be chosen as a pre - specified set of analysis functions ( wavelets , gaussian packets , gabor functions etc . ) , or designed by modeling its content to a given set of signal examples @xcite .",
    "the success of such dictionaries in applications depends on how suitable they are to sparsely describe the signals in question .",
    "a general family of analysis functions can be obtained by scaling and translating a single normalized window function @xmath120 , with @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , for any scale @xmath122 and translation @xmath123 we define the atom @xmath124 of the dictionary @xmath100 as following:@xmath125 therefore , the index @xmath126 of the atom function depends on both @xmath127 and @xmath128 parameters : @xmath129 .",
    "thus , in order to represent @xmath1 in the dictionary @xmath100 , we need to select an appropriate countable subset of atoms @xmath124 , @xmath130 , such that @xmath1 can be written as a linear expansion . depending on the choice of the atoms @xmath124",
    ", the expansion coefficients will give explicit information about the behavior of @xmath1 .",
    "for example , we should note here that different wavelet transforms correspond to different families of atoms . in our definition ,",
    "we do not limit the dictionary to a single wavelet basis , on contrary we consider an over - complete set , which also may contain different concatenated families ( sub - dictionaries ) of such analysis functions . in order to illustrate numerically this approach ,",
    "let us consider the boxcar dictionary , defined as : @xmath131 an important characteristic of the boxcar dictionary is that it can capture sources with arbitrary thickness .",
    "another advantage is its easy discretization . in our case , the discretization grid has @xmath62 points @xmath69 with the sampling resolution @xmath61 .",
    "thus , assuming that the maximum width of a boxcar atom is @xmath132 , where @xmath133 , then for each scale @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and translation @xmath136 , @xmath137 we can define a boxcar function with the index @xmath138 , such that:@xmath139 therefore , one can define maximum @xmath140 boxcar functions on such a grid , and we can easily build a discrete dictionary matrix @xmath100 of size @xmath105 . in this paper",
    "we limit our discussion to the boxcar dictionary defined above , since it is simple enough to illustrate the approach , and to provide meaningful results .",
    "also , this dictionary includes by construction the dirac set of functions , which in this case are the first @xmath62 functions with @xmath141 .",
    "a similar approach can be used to build sub - dictionaries corresponding to other families of analysis functions .",
    "the sparse decomposition can also be used to perform a multi - scale analysis , by considering all the dictionaries @xmath142 , where @xmath143 . also , let us assume that @xmath144 is the solution obtained for the scale @xmath145 , i.e. the recovered discrete representation of @xmath1 with the dictionary @xmath142 .",
    "we consider a @xmath146 matrix @xmath147 , where each line with the index @xmath145 corresponds to the solution obtained for the scale @xmath145 , i.e. @xmath148 .",
    "obviously , the solution @xmath149 will depend on the maximum scale @xmath145 used in each dictionary @xmath142 , and by visualizing the matrix @xmath147 , we obtain a representation of the behavior of the solution at different scales .",
    "the sparse optimization problem , defined in the previous section , is known as basis pursuit denoising ( bpd ) @xcite , and if written in a lagrangian form : @xmath150,\\ ] ] it can be thought of as a least squares problem with an @xmath87 regularizer , where @xmath151 is a parameter that controls the trade - off between sparsity and reconstruction fidelity .",
    "thus , bpd solves a regularization problem with a trade - off between having a small residual and making the solution simple in the @xmath87 sense .",
    "the solutions of bpd are often the best computationally tractable approximation of the under - determined system of equations @xcite . in our case , since the direct space and the inverse fourier space are perfectly incoherent , the problem can be solved using linear programming techniques whose computational complexities are polynomial . however , for the sparse rm approximation problem , the bpd approach requires the solution of a very large convex , non - quadratic optimization problem , and therefore suffers from high computational complexity . due to the complexity of the linear programming approach",
    ", several other @xmath87 optimization methods have been proposed to solve the bpd problem @xcite . here",
    ", we consider a method based on sub - optimal greedy algorithms , which requires far less computation .",
    "our goal is not only to obtain a good sparse expansion , but also to provide a fast computational method , therefore here we focus our attention on the greedy matching pursuit ( mp ) algorithm @xcite , which is the fastest known algorithm for the bpd problem @xcite .",
    "mp has many applications in signal and image coding , shape representation and recognition , data compression etc .",
    "one of its main features is that it can be applied to arbitrary dictionaries .",
    "starting from an initial approximation @xmath152 and residual @xmath153 , the algorithm uses an iterative greedy strategy to pick the column vectors @xmath154 which best reduce the residual . at every time step",
    "@xmath155 the current residual @xmath156 can be decomposed as following : @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the future residual , and @xmath159 is the standard inner product operator in the complex hilbert space . since @xmath158 and @xmath154 are orthogonal , @xmath160 , we have:@xmath161 in order to minimize the norm of the future residual , the algorithm should choose the column vector @xmath154 which maximizes the projection on the current residual : @xmath162 therefore , after choosing the best column @xmath163 one can update the solution and the residual as following:@xmath164 @xmath165 where @xmath166 thus , after @xmath155 iteration steps the resulted solution is a sparse vector @xmath167 with the non - zero coefficients @xmath168 .",
    "the algorithm stops when the maximum number of iterations has been reached ( which usually is set to @xmath169 ) , or when the norm of the residual becomes comparable with the standard deviation of the noise .",
    "the reconstruction of the target signals is then given by : @xmath170 @xmath171 the pseudo - code of the rm - mp algorithm is listed in the appendix .",
    "in order to illustrate the described deconvolution method , we have considered two different experiment configurations , corresponding to two different ranges of observed frequencies .",
    "the first one is consistent with the observations with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) in the frequency range 315 mhz to 375 mhz , as described in @xcite .",
    "the second one is consistent with the observations with the arecibo telescope in the frequency range 1225 mhz to 1525 mhz , for the galactic alfa continuum survey ( galfacts ) , as described in @xcite .",
    "the separation between the frequency windows is roughly 1 ghz , and therefore the maximum observable faraday depth and the half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf are quite different . here",
    "we will show that the rm - mp method provides very good results in both cases .    as a testbed for numerical simulations , we have considered a mixed scenario consisting of three components with different widths , such that the simulation results provide the response of the algorithm to a full range of component widths .",
    "the first one is a thin component given by : @xmath172 .",
    "the second is a thick component given by : @xmath173 if @xmath174 , and @xmath175 otherwise .",
    "the third is a thicker component defined by : @xmath176 if @xmath177 , and @xmath175 otherwise .",
    "thus , this scenario can be easily scaled for different computational windows @xmath178 $ ] , where @xmath60 is given in @xmath2 .",
    "also , we have considered that all the observational channels are equally weighted : i.e. @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 .",
    "the various parameters associated with the wsrt experiment layout @xcite are listed bellow :    frequency range : @xmath182 , @xmath183 ;    wave length range : @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 ;    number of channels : @xmath187 ;    half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf : @xmath188 ;    maximum observable faraday depth : @xmath189 ;    let us first consider the ideal noiseless case , when the sampling resolution in the @xmath19 space is equal with the half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf , @xmath190 , and the computational window is @xmath191 . in this particular case , as shown in figure 1 , the rm - mp algorithm provides an exact solution , since @xmath192 and therefore no information is lost in the measurement .",
    "one can also notice that in this noiseless exact sampling case , the solution is independent of the scale used in the dictionary , as it can be seen on the multi - scale representation for @xmath193 .",
    "however , the problem becomes ill - defined in the following situations : the noise is present ; the sampling resolution becomes finer than the half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf , @xmath194 ; and the number of independent observed channels is smaller than the number of points in the @xmath19 space , @xmath195 . in this case",
    "the system becomes under - determined , and therefore some information is lost . in order to exemplify this situation",
    ", we consider a scenario in which all these factors are present . we add noise with the standard deviation @xmath196 , to the @xmath12 and @xmath13 values .",
    "we limit the computational window to @xmath197 , and we increase the number of points on the @xmath19 grid to @xmath198 , which is double of the number of observation channels @xmath187 .",
    "this results in a sampling resolution of @xmath199 .",
    "the obtained results ( for @xmath200 , @xmath201 ) are shown in figure 2 .",
    "one can see that the phase of some components can not be reliably recovered anymore , since there is not enough information in the signal to be detected properly .",
    "we should note that the problem is correctly resolved in the noiseless case ( not shown here ) .",
    "thus , the effect of noise addition consists in a partial loss of information about the phase of @xmath1 , which is expected , since the number of solutions compatible with the data increases dramatically with the added noise .",
    "also , we should point out that the solution improves by increasing the signal - to - noise ratio , as shown in figure 3 , where we have increased the amplitude of the components by a factor of 1.5 , keeping their phase unchanged .",
    "one can see that in this case , the rm - mp method resolves correctly all the components .",
    "this result suggests that an adequate signal to noise ratio should be taken into account , in order for the method to be successful .",
    "the galfacts survey , carried out with the arecibo telescope , has the following parameters :    frequency range : @xmath202 , @xmath203 ;    wave length range : @xmath204 , @xmath205 , @xmath206 ;    half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf : @xmath207 ;    the maximum observable faraday depth , @xmath55 , is inverse proportional with the width of the observation channel @xmath208 , and by increasing the number of channels , the maximum observable faraday depth becomes unreasonable high .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain some meaningful results , we have to limit both the number of observation channels in the @xmath17 space , and the computational window in the @xmath19 space .",
    "first we consider that the compuational window is limited to @xmath209 and the number of observation channels is @xmath210 . also , we consider the same testbed as for wsrt case , and we add noise with the standard deviation @xmath211 .",
    "in addition , we increase the number of points on the @xmath19 grid to @xmath212 , and therefore we obtain a sampling resolution : @xmath213 .",
    "the obtained results ( for @xmath200 , @xmath201 ) are shown in figure 4 .",
    "one can see that all the components are relatively well resolved , with a small error in the phase , but with almost exact amplitudes . in the next experiment we zoom more in the @xmath19 space , and we impose a computational window of @xmath214 , keeping the same number of observation channels and number of points on the @xmath19 grid , such that @xmath215 .",
    "the results are again reasonable good , as shown in figure 5 , with a small variation of the phase due to the uncertainty introduced by the noise addition . however , if we zoom further in the @xmath19 space the solution is not as good anymore , as it can be seen in figure 6 . in this case",
    "we have a much finer sampling resolution @xmath216 , corresponding to a computational window of @xmath217 , number of observation channels @xmath218 , and the number of points on the @xmath19 grid @xmath219 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that by increasing @xmath40 , we have increased also the standard deviation of the noise to @xmath220 , such that the signal to noise ratio is smaller than before .",
    "again , an improved solution can be obtained by increasing the amplitude of the components , such that the signal to noise ratio is higher .      in the previous numerical experiments we have shown that the rm - mp algorithm is able to resolve correctly the components from the input @xmath1 model , if the separation between the components is higher than the half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf . in order to estimate the response of the rm - mp algorithm at resolutions beyond the rmsf limit , we consider two dirac components , @xmath221 , and respectively @xmath222 , separated by @xmath223 , where @xmath224 is the half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf .",
    "the numerical experiments show that the rm - mp algorithm can not resolve correctly the two components , but returns a boxcar function centered at the exact position value @xmath19 , with a width equal with the separation between the two components . in order to illustrate this result we consider the wsrt scenario , with @xmath191 , @xmath187 and @xmath225 , which gives a sampling resolution @xmath226 , in the @xmath19 space . in figure 8",
    "we give the width of the output boxcar function @xmath227 as a function of the input separation @xmath228 .",
    "one can see that for all performed experiments we have @xmath229 . also , in figure 9 we show a typical example , where the input separation is @xmath230 , or approximatively @xmath231 from @xmath224 .",
    "thus , even at resolutions beyond the half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf , the rm - mp algorithm provides some useful information , i.e. the position and the separation width of the two components .",
    "the above numerical experiments have shown that the sparse rm - mp method works well for relatively simple sparse problems .",
    "we should note that the method can be used to recover more complex dispersion functions .",
    "for example , let us consider the situation from figure 7 , where we have two thin components and two thick components .",
    "the first thick component is modeled as a gaussian , while the second is modeled as a boxcar function .",
    "also , we assume the noisy wsrt experiment configuration , with : @xmath232 , @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "one can see that all the sources are almost exactly recovered , including the thick gaussian , even though the dictionary does not contain any gaussian functions .",
    "in fact , the shape of the gaussian is reconstructed from several boxcar functions from the dictionary .",
    "thus , the boxcar dictionary can be used to recover more complex functions .",
    "however , the success of the method depends on another aspect which has not yet been discussed .",
    "more specifically , the performance of the rm - mp method depends on the number of observation channels @xmath40 , the number of points @xmath62 on the @xmath19 grid , and the number @xmath236 of non - zero components in the discrete representation of the faraday depth function @xmath1 .",
    "an important question here is that given @xmath40 and @xmath62 , what is the maximum value of @xmath236 , for a faithful recovery of @xmath1 ?",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that any @xmath236-sparse signals of length @xmath62 , with @xmath237 , can be recovered from only @xmath238 random measurements ( projections ) , where @xmath239 .",
    "the answer to this question is not obvious for the sparse rm synthesis problem , since the reconstruction process will depend on experiment layout , i.e. the observed frequency band and the half maximum of the main peak of the rmsf .",
    "this is an important theoretical question which we would like to address in the future development , in order to improve the performance of the method .",
    "the recently introduced faraday rm synthesis is becoming an important tool for analyzing multichannel polarized radio data , and derive properties of astrophysical magnetic fields .",
    "the method requires the solution of an ill - conditioned deconvolution problem , in order to recover the intrinsic faraday dispersion function , and therefore the development of robust methods has become crucial for the rm synthesis applications . here",
    ", we have assumed that the complex faraday dispersion function @xmath1 can be approximated by a small number of discrete components from an over - complete dictionary , and we have developed a greedy algorithm to solve the deconvolution problem .",
    "the method uses an over - complete dictionary of functions which can be efficiently used in a multi - scaling context , and it can easily include different types of analysis functions .",
    "we also have presented several numerical simulations showing the effect of the covered range and sampling resolution in the faraday depth space , and the effect of noise on the observed data .",
    "the numerical results show that the described method performs well at common resolution values and coverage range in the faraday depth space , and it is quite robust in the presence of noise .",
    "therefore , the described technique is well suited for exploratory data analysis , and it can be used as a complement to the previously proposed methods .",
