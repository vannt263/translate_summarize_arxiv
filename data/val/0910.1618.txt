    "the study of flavor physics is interesting both because we do not understand why there is smallness and hierarchy in the standard model ( sm ) flavor parameters , and because flavor physics holds a key to understanding theories beyond the sm .",
    "if supersymmetry is discovered at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , then studying its flavor properties  the masses and mixings of sleptons and squarks  may indeed take us a long way toward understanding the sm flavor parameters , and will also shed light on the underlying structure of supersymmetry and supersymmetry breaking . in this work , we take some new steps toward a quantitative analysis of the actual prospects for supersymmetric flavor measurements at the lhc , following earlier studies of lepton flavor studies at the lhc  @xcite . our goal is to answer the following questions :    * how many sleptons might the lhc be able to identify ? * how precisely can the masses of these sleptons be measured ? * can the flavor decomposition of these sleptons be determined ?    the answers to these questions may ultimately allow us to identify the correct theory of lepton flavor , which has eluded us for decades despite plentiful experimental data .",
    "still , even these first questions are ambitious , and for this reason our objective here is not to undertake a comprehensive study of all supersymmetric models , but rather to work toward an existence proof that , in some well - motivated cases , significant progress is possible . to do this , we will choose a favorable model to analyze .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , hybrid supersymmetric models were constructed in which sfermion masses receive both flavor - conserving gauge - mediated contributions and flavor - violating gravity - mediated contributions governed by a @xmath0 horizontal symmetry .",
    "these models satisfy all low - energy constraints obtained from flavor factories , and also explain all charged lepton and neutrino masses and mixings in terms of a few charge assignments under the flavor - symmetry . at the same time , the gravity - mediated effects , although subdominant , are larger than yukawa - generated renormalization group ( rg ) effects and predict significant flavor mixing for sleptons and sneutrinos , with potentially striking implications for supersymmetric signals at the lhc . in these models ,",
    "the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the gravitino , and the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is metastable .",
    "we will examine a model in which the nlsp is a charged slepton , the slepton mass splittings are large enough to be observable , and some flavor mixings are significant .",
    "although we focus on this model , the techniques developed are also applicable to models with other forms of hybrid supersymmetry breaking ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and other similar frameworks .    with a metastable slepton nlsp",
    ", there is no missing energy associated with the nlsp , and supersymmetric decay chains are , in principle , fully reconstructible .",
    "we choose a model in which the lightest two sleptons are predominantly a selectron and a smuon .",
    "these features are favorable for our analysis .",
    "other features of the model are not as favorable : the two lightest sleptons are quasi - degenerate , with a mass splitting of roughly 5 gev ; the mixing of these two sleptons is small ; and one of the remaining sleptons is an almost pure stau , so that its decays always involve taus which are hard to reconstruct .    in this analysis",
    ", we will only use information from electrons and muons , and assume that taus are not reconstructed at all .",
    "even with this restrictive assumption , we find that one can extract quite a lot of information , including precision measurements of five slepton masses and one mixing angle , as well as @xmath1 estimates of the remaining mixing angles .",
    "we expect that these results may be improved , perhaps significantly , in a full analysis optimized to extract information from tau events also .",
    "we now specify the model precisely and explain its key features . in our model ,",
    "sfermion masses receive dominant flavor - conserving contributions from gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) and smaller , but still significant , flavor - violating contributions from gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking .",
    "note that the gravity - mediated contributions are generically present , since they arise from generic khler potential contact terms between the supersymmetry - breaking sector and the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the size of the gravity - mediated contributions relative to the gmsb contributions is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of @xmath4 messengers , @xmath5 is the messenger scale , @xmath6 is the planck scale , and @xmath7 stands for either the su(2 ) or u(1 ) fine - structure constant .",
    "@xmath8 is the supersymmetry - breaking @xmath9-term associated with gauge - mediation . in addition , the supersymmetry - breaking sector typically contains other @xmath9 terms as well , and the gravity - mediated contributions are determined by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 are the non - gmsb @xmath9-terms .",

    "we choose @xmath14 , so that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is the gravitino , with mass @xmath15 .",
    "the nlsp will be generically long - lived in these models even for a low messenger scale , since then its decays to the gravitino are suppressed by the large @xmath16 .",
    "the identity of the nlsp in these models is determined by the number of messenger fields @xmath3 . for small @xmath3",
    "it is a neutralino , and for large @xmath3 it is a charged slepton .",
    "we would like the nlsp to be a charged slepton , with a large enough mass splitting between the lightest neutralino and the nlsp that neutralino decays to the nlsp are observable .",

    "we assume that the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) mechanism  @xcite governs the flavor structure of the gravity - mediated contributions  @xcite .",
    "as has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are many possible scenarios that satisfy these constraints .",
    "we are particularly interested in models where the mass splitting between slepton generations is at least a few gev , so that atlas / cms will perhaps be able to measure it , and where at least some slepton mass eigenstates have appreciable components of both electron and muon flavors , so that atlas / cms will have the potential of observing mixing .",

    "second , the flavor mixing , determined by a @xmath0 horizontal symmetry , is significant .",
    "schematically , the @xmath22 flavor decompositions of the slepton mass eigenstates are @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the small breaking parameter of the fn symmetry , and the sleptons are ordered by their masses from @xmath25 , the heaviest , to @xmath26 , the lightest",

    "this may require a rather complicated fn model  @xcite .",
    "] we see that there is significant mixing in many , although not all , of the sleptons . to fully specify model b , one must also choose 21 @xmath1 coefficients , one for each independent component of the gravity - mediated contributions .",
    "we use this freedom to fix the mass ordering so that the lighter sleptons are dominantly @xmath27- and @xmath28-flavored , since this improves the prospects for precision mass and mixing measurements .    our model , then , is completely specified by the input parameters for the gmsb `` spine , '' the horizontal symmetry and charge assignments of model b , and the @xmath1 parameters entering the gravity - mediated sfermion mass contributions .",
    "these input parameters are listed in appendix  [ sec : details ] .",
    "we then give these input parameters to spice  @xcite , a computer program that determines from these parameters the masses and flavor composition of all superparticles , along with their flavor - general decay branching ratios .",
    "spice interfaces with softsusy  @xcite to generate the sparticle mass spectrum , and it calls susyhit  @xcite to generate non - flavor violating decays . the decays generated by spice include all possible lepton flavor combinations for the decays of charginos , neutralinos , sleptons , and sneutrinos .",
    "all possible two - body decays are included , along with relevant three - body slepton decays @xmath29 in cases where the only kinematically allowed two - body decays involve gravitinos  @xcite . note that , because of flavor mixing , the sleptons and leptons in these 3-body decays can , in principle , carry any flavor .",
    "spice produces herwig  @xcite and susy les houches accord  @xcite input files , which may be used to generate collider events . in this work",

    "the masses and flavor compositions of the six sleptons are given graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "( precise values for these masses and mixings , and also for the sneutrinos , are also given in tables  [ table : sleptons ] and [ table : sneutrinos ] . )",
    "although spice properly accounts for full @xmath30 slepton mixing , in this model there are no @xmath31-term contributions associated with the gravity - mediated contributions , and so the only left - right mixing is small and originates from rg evolution .",

    "[ fig : spectrum ] , the lowest lying supersymmetric states have the following hierarchy : @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the lightest neutralino , which is mostly the bino , and @xmath49 is the second - lightest neutralino , which is , to a good approximation , the neutral wino .",
    "the dominant decay modes are @xmath50 these are also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "there are several noteworthy features .",
    "first , the decays of @xmath51 directly to the light sleptons @xmath52 are highly suppressed , since these sleptons are dominantly right - handed and have no couplings to winos .",
    "second , the leptons in the @xmath53 decays are quite soft and may be difficult to detect .",
    "finally , the slepton - to - slepton @xmath53 decays may be either charge - preserving or charge - flipping .",
    "the charge - flipping modes are possible because the neutralino is a majorana fermion , and the possibility of both kinds of decays will play a crucial role in the analysis described below .",
    "we generate our signal events for the lhc with center - of - mass energy @xmath54 using herwig  @xcite and pass them through a generic lhc detector simulation , acerdet 1.0  @xcite .",
    "we configure acerdet as follows : electrons and muons are selected with @xmath55 gev and @xmath56 .",
    "electrons and muons are considered to be isolated if they are separated from other leptons and jets by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 , and if less than 10 gev of energy is deposited in a cone of @xmath59 .",
    "the lepton momentum resolutions we use are parameterized from the results of full simulation of the atlas detector  @xcite ; our electrons are smeared according to a pseudorapidity - dependent parametrization , while muons are smeared according to the results for @xmath60 .",
    "the leading - order two - to - two supersymmetric cross section determined by herwig with cteq5l parton distribution functions is 1.154 pb . we generate 115,400  events , corresponding to @xmath61 of data .",
    "acerdet does not take into account lepton reconstruction efficiencies .",
    "we therefore apply by hand a reconstruction efficiency of 90% to the muons and a reconstruction efficiency of 77% to the electrons .",
    "this gives 0.86 as the ratio of electron to muon reconstruction efficiency .    in a real detector or full simulation thereof , a long - lived charged slepton , such as our @xmath62 ,",
    "would be expected to produce a visible track by virtue of its charge .",
    "measurement of the curvature of this track would determine the @xmath62 _",
    "momentum_. if the @xmath62 arrival time were also to be measured with sufficient accuracy , the @xmath62 _ speed _ could also be determined .",
    "the momentum and speed may be combined to determine the track _ mass _ , which will constitute the primary signature for the existence of new physics ( _ i.e. _ , the @xmath62 ) in our signal events .",
    "acerdet is not a full detector simulation and so , unsurprisingly , does not produce track objects or speed `` measurements '' associated with our long - lived sleptons .",
    "since measurement errors associated with the @xmath62 are potentially very important in our study , it is necessary to augment acerdet by incorporating additional parameterizations for @xmath62 momentum and speed measurements .",
    "we used the resolutions taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , based on atlas muon resistive plate chamber ( rpc ) timings . given these results , to model the reconstructed @xmath62 momentum ,",
    "we start with the momentum taken from monte carlo truth , and then smear the slepton s 3-momentum magnitudes @xmath63 and speeds @xmath64 by gaussian distributions with @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the slepton s energy and direction are not smeared .",
    "note that we could just as easily have used another parametrization based on atlas muon drift tube ( mdt ) fits  @xcite .",
    "our use of just one such source of timing information might therefore mean that our speed resolution can be improved in a future study .",
    "we only consider sleptons with @xmath67 to be reconstructible , because sleptons moving any slower are unlikely to reach the muon chambers quickly enough to be registered in the same bunch crossing . in our events ,",
    "95@xmath68 of sleptons have a speed , @xmath64 , greater than 0.6 .",
    "having parametrized the slepton reconstruction process above , subsequent uses of expressions like `` @xmath62 momentum '' and `` @xmath64 '' refer to the smeared ( supposedly reconstructed ) quantities rather than to monte carlo truth .",
    "in this section we outline our approach to measuring the mixings and masses of the six sleptons . as",
    "our nlsp is a metastable charged particle , our entire decay chain is , in principle , fully reconstructible .",
    "our goal is therefore to reconstruct the various superpartners , starting with the slepton nlsp , by working our way up the decay chain , constructing various invariant mass distributions . in this section",
    "we explain each invariant mass distribution and in the next section we interpret the results in terms of mixings and masses .    as explained in sec .  [",
    "sec : intro ] , in this analysis we ignore tau leptons , and instead only consider what we can deduce about masses and mixings from observing electrons and muons .",
    "we make this choice because tau reconstruction is expected to be poor in comparison to electron and muon reconstruction , but the inclusion of tau reconstruction certainly merits further study .      in each event , direct reconstruction of the @xmath62 momentum , speed , and mass is expected to be relatively straightforward , using the slow charged track signature already described in sec .",
    "[ sec : event ] . we restrict our attention to sleptons with speeds in the range @xmath69 .",
    "the necessity of the lower bound has already been mentioned .",
    "the upper bound effectively distinguishes supersymmetric events from background  @xcite , and also plays a crucial role in improving the resolution of the @xmath62 mass measurement .",
    "of the sleptons with @xmath70 , @xmath71 have @xmath72 and so pass this extra restriction . the reconstructed mass distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : slepton1 ] before and after we impose the upper @xmath64 limit . as expected , even ignoring background that will enter the @xmath73 distribution ( but is not included in fig .  [",
    "fig : slepton1]a ) , this distribution is fit poorly by a gaussian curve , and hence we obtain a better measurement of slepton mass by considering the slowest of the sleptons . after requiring @xmath74",
    ", we assume that the efficiency for reconstructing @xmath26 is 100% , and we do not require these sleptons to pass any isolation criteria .",
    "figure  [ fig : slepton1 ] tells us two valuable things .",
    "first , for any given event , the slepton mass is measured to an accuracy of the order of 10 gev .",
    "second , from taking all of the events together , the _ statistical _ error on the mean mass is much smaller , of the order of 0.1 gev .",
    "the strong agreement between the underlying @xmath26 mass and the fitted mean reconstructed @xmath26 mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : slepton1 ] is perhaps misleading .",
    "such agreement was to be expected as no sources of systematic offsets were introduced in our smearing process .",
    "realistically , the fitted mean reconstructed @xmath26 mass will be subject to some systematic offset , even after all attempts to calibrate the detector have been completed .",
    "the size and direction of such an offset can not be known in advance , so we do not attempt to simulate any systematic offset in this analysis .",
    "we can make use of the high precision ( mean ) mass measurement from the set of all events to help us remove some of the momentum and time - of - flight measurement errors in individual events , thereby reducing our exposure to the 10 gev event - by - event variability in reconstructed slepton masses .",
    "we do this by scaling each component of the four - momentum of every slow charged track by a constant so that the track mass matches the mean mass obtained from the fit to all events .",
    "after rescaling , the smeared and rescaled momentum is centered on the true momentum with a full - width half - maximum of @xmath75 gev and rms of 9.9 gev , and the corresponding energy difference distribution has a full - width half - maximum of @xmath76 gev and rms of 9.4 gev .",
    "we find that this event - by - event rescaling process is necessary to allow us sufficient resolution to travel up the decay chain and determine the masses of sparticles heavier than the nlsp .",
    "the next most obvious particles to reconstruct are the next two lightest sleptons , @xmath53 .",
    "we see in fig .  [",
    "fig : spectrum ] that the dominant @xmath53 decays are three - body . in principle , given an ideal detector , we could reconstruct the @xmath53 by looking at the three - particle invariant mass distributions resulting from combining the @xmath62 with all possible combinations of two further leptons which give a charged @xmath53 candidate .",
    "since in this analysis we are not reconstructing taus , we can not detect @xmath32 in this way .",
    "we will briefly comment on the @xmath32 in sec .",
    "[ sec : slepton3 ] .    unfortunately , direct reconstruction of @xmath77 is also impossible as @xmath62 and @xmath77 are nearly degenerate . in fig .",

    "these do , in fact , make a measurement of the @xmath34 mass possible , as we describe in the next section .      in this section",
    "we describe the @xmath83 reconstruction , and explain how it can be used to detect @xmath34 and measure its mass as well .    referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , we see that the neutralino can decay to any one of the three light sleptons .",
    "let us first discuss neutralino decays to @xmath26 and @xmath34 , with the @xmath34 subsequently decaying to @xmath26 via a 3-body decay .",
    "since the leptons involved in this 3-body decay , @xmath46 , are typically soft , they will usually go undetected , so that one only observes the final @xmath26 and the hard lepton , @xmath84 , coming from the original neutralino decay .",
    "( throughout this section , subscripts on the leptons are as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] . )",
    "we therefore define two main categories of neutralino decay  direct and indirect .",
    "the latter is further divided into two subcategories , which we name `` os indirect '' and `` ss indirect , '' based on whether the final @xmath26 has the opposite or same sign as the lepton @xmath84 :    * direct decays of @xmath85 to the slepton nlsp : @xmath86 * indirect decays of the @xmath85 to the slepton nlsp via @xmath34 , @xmath87 , followed by a three - body @xmath77 decay of one of the following types : * * @xmath88 os indirect * * @xmath89 ss indirect    note that in the instance of a direct decay , the @xmath26 and the lepton @xmath84 must be oppositely charged , whereas in indirect decays , same - sign charges are also possible .",
    "detection of same - sign events are direct evidence of the majorana nature of the neutralino . as mentioned above , with a hard lepton @xmath78 cut , only the lepton @xmath84 is observed .      for both the direct and os indirect decays ,",
    "the @xmath62 and the lepton @xmath84 have opposite signs .",
    "these channels therefore have identical signatures and are therefore reconstructed in tandem .",
    "we take all os @xmath90 and @xmath91 combinations and reconstruct the invariant masses @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "when our os @xmath26 and lepton are from a direct decay , we expect to reconstruct the @xmath83 mass exactly .",
    "however , when the @xmath26 results from an indirect decay , we do not expect to correctly reconstruct the @xmath83 as we are missing the two soft leptons produced in the decay @xmath94 .",
    "such events nevertheless contain valuable information : as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath26-lepton invariant mass then exhibits a `` shifted peak , '' somewhat lower than the neutralino mass , by an amount @xmath95 here @xmath96 is the neutralino mass , the mean of the @xmath97 invariant mass distribution , @xmath98 is the reconstructed mean of the @xmath26 mass , and @xmath99 . for our model parameters we predict @xmath100 . by",

    "[ fig : leptons ] ) .",
    "we decompose these distributions ( and the distributions that follow ) into the sum of an exponentially falling background and one or more gaussian peaks .",

    "of course , in the model we are considering , each one of these samples contains both these peaks , but because of the flavor compositions of @xmath26 and @xmath34 , the @xmath112 sample is dominated by direct decays , and therefore seems to exhibit just the unshifted peak at @xmath114  gev , while the @xmath113 sample is dominated by indirect decays , and therefore seems to exhibit just the shifted peak at @xmath115  gev . in a general model , with larger mixings , one would see a double - peak structure , which might be harder to disentangle .",
    "then , however , the ss decays can come to our aid : these can only originate from indirect decays , and thus will cleanly exhibit only the shifted peak , with no contamination from direct decays .",

    "these are dominantly @xmath123",
    ". the tau decay could give another charged lepton , but this charged lepton would typically be softer than the original electron produced in the @xmath32 decay .",
    "thus , when we consider the invariant mass of this electron paired with the @xmath26 , we should find a peak somewhat below the @xmath32 mass , much like the shifted neutralino peak discussed in the previous two sections .",
    "an analogous peak should also occur for @xmath124 pairs , coming either from direct @xmath125 decays , or from indirect decays through @xmath126 .",
    "however , this peak starts at around 140 gev , which , as we already know , is the @xmath34 mass .",
    "we therefore expect another peak around 140 gev , originating from @xmath127 decays with one soft lepton . in a real detector ,",
    "smearing effects would then make it hard to conclusively establish the identity of the 160 gev peak .",
    "we therefore leave the question of @xmath32 identification for future work , in which tau leptons are carefully treated .",

    "<S> many supersymmetric events are therefore fully reconstructible , and we can reconstruct most of the charged sleptons by working up the long supersymmetric decay chains . we obtain promising results for both masses and mixings , and conclude that , given a favorable model , precise measurements at the lhc may help shed light not only on new physics , but also on the standard model flavor parameters . </S>"
