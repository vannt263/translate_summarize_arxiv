    "absorption - line measurements of superwinds in nearby galaxies are now common . recently",
    ", large surveys have performed measurements at moderate spectral resolution of the  d  doublet to study outflowing gas in infrared - luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "these surveys show that all infrared - luminous galaxies host massive winds .",
    "the detection rate of blueshifted absorption lines is less than 100% in infrared - luminous galaxies , but this does not reflect the actual frequency of occurrence of outflows in these galaxies , which is @xmath5100% . instead , this reflects the fact that the wind does not cover the galaxy completely @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the mass , momentum , and energy of the outflowing gas are large and scale with the host galaxy s star formation rate , luminosity , and mass @xcite .",
    "recent mid - infrared observations , as well as radio identifications of submillimeter - selected galaxies , show that luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies host most of the star formation in the universe at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of massive winds in infrared - luminous galaxies means that these outflows have a significant impact on the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic medium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) in the period when most of the stars in the universe are forming .",
    "these conclusions rely on accurate measurements of column densities through profile fitting .",
    "however , unresolved , narrow components can cause an underestimate of the true column density of the absorbing gas @xcite .",
    "the resolution limits of these surveys are @xmath665  km  s@xmath2  fwhm , and the intrinsic velocity profiles are several hundred km  s@xmath2  on average @xcite .",
    "these profiles are almost certainly superpositions of many components of smaller widths , some of which could be saturated .",
    "a handful of dwarf galaxies have been studied at high resolution ( @xmath7  km  s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) ; the narrowest components in these surveys are still resolved , with fwhm  @xmath8  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "it is necessary to apply the same spectral resolution to a sample of massive , infrared - luminous galaxies , to place limits on the possible errors in column density measurements .",
    "for the first time , we have observed infrared - luminous galaxies at high spectral resolution ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "we studied the  ddoublet ( @xmath9 ) in four ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ; @xmath10 ) and one luminous infrared galaxy ( lirg ; @xmath11 ) with the high - resolution spectrograph on keck  i. our primary purpose is to find components that may be unresolved by our moderate - resolution spectra @xcite and confirm or revise our column density measurements .",
    "we selected five galaxies that represent a variety of interesting  d  profile types from the parent sample of @xcite .",
    "one galaxy has a near - systemic component in  d  with a low - velocity blue wing .",
    "three show broad , relatively smooth profiles with different numbers of components and velocity widths .",
    "a fifth possesses an irregular  d  profile with some redshifted components .",
    "four have infrared luminosities dominated by a starburst ( liner spectral type ) and one is a seyfert 2 .",
    "their redshifts range from 0.02 to 0.14 .",
    "these galaxies and their properties are listed in table [ sample ] .",
    "we observed them during one community - access night ( 27 dec 2003 ut ) at the keck i telescope using the high resolution spectrograph ( hires ; @xcite ) .",
    "we used a different set - up for each galaxy , in order to optimally align the  d  feature and prominent emission lines on the detector .",
    "the slit size was 1722 @xmath12 14  ( the d4 decker ) , yielding a resolution of @xmath13  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the old 2k@xmath122k ccd was in use , as well as the gg-475 filter and red collimator .",
    "data reduction was performed with the makee software package .",
    "the spectra of the  d  line in these five galaxies are displayed in figure [ spec ] .",
    "the moderate - resolution spectra @xcite are plotted below .",
    "overlaid on these spectra are fitted profiles , the components of each fit , and 1@xmath14 error bars .",
    "the fitting procedure is described in detail in @xcite . in brief , we fit multiple velocity components , assuming gaussians in optical depth and a constant covering fraction for each .",
    "the fitting is performed with the lmfit code and measurement errors are computed from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the column densities are then computed from the fitted parameters .",
    "table [ compprop ] lists the fit parameters and column densities of each velocity component .",
    "fitting only a few components ( @xmath15 ) does a good job of matching the profile shapes .",
    "there are a few places in the spectra where the data and model do not match perfectly , but these can be attributed to small deviations from gaussianity in the optical depth profile or a varying covering fraction .",
    "power spectra of the residuals from the fit show nothing significant .",
    "the moderate- and high - resolution profiles are almost identical . at a resolution of 13  @xmath16 ,",
    "these galaxies have remarkably smooth  dprofiles .",
    "there are some high - frequency variations in the spectra that would appear to be marginally significant based on the 1@xmath14 poisson errors",
    ". these can not be stellar absorption lines ; their widths of tens of km  s@xmath2  or less are inconsistent with the much larger stellar velocity dispersions of ulirgs @xcite .",
    "if they were due to variation in the absorbing gas properties , they would not appear in the continuum , which they do .",
    "we conclude that these variations are due to underestimated noise ( e.g. , flat - fielding errors , fringing ) .",
    "to fit the data , we increase the number of components until the properties of one or more components becomes unconstrained in monte carlo simulations @xcite . using more components",
    "causes instabilities in the solution , and using fewer components provides an unacceptable fit .",
    "we find that in every case but one ( f02437@xmath172122 ) the same number of components is required at both resolutions .",
    "a close examination of figure [ spec ] shows that corresponding components are in general similar in velocity and shape at different resolutions .",
    "one difference is that high resolution gives more sensitivity to high optical depths , which allows us to relax the parameter boundaries imposed on the moderate - resolution observations ( @xmath18 ) . despite this",
    ", we fit only one high - resolution component with @xmath19 .",
    "a more quantitative test of the differences between high and moderate resolution components confirms these similarities on average .",
    "we find that the median velocity difference per component is within a few km  s@xmath2  of zero .",
    "the column densities in the high - resolution data are lower by 45%  on average ( and do not change by more than a factor of 3 ) .",
    "the outflowing masses , momenta , and energies decrease by 20%  on average .",
    "these results are consistent within the errors with those from moderate resolution spectroscopy .",
    "we thus demonstrate that the conclusions of recent surveys @xcite are robust to increases in spectral resolution .",
    "some noticeable differences exist between the moderate- and high - resolution data of f02437@xmath172122 , including changes in profile depth and shifts in wavelength .",
    "these are likely due to the different aperture sizes of the two observations : the high - resolution extraction aperture subtends 4  arcsec@xmath20 , while the moderate - resolution aperture subtends 12  arcsec@xmath20 .",
    "( the differences in aperture for the other four galaxies are negligible . )",
    "the larger aperture may probe a different overall velocity distribution of gas ( since we observe rotation in  d  in this galaxy in the moderate - resolution data ) and include more continuum light .",
    "in one galaxy , f09039@xmath170503 , we resolve a narrow component that was unresolved by our moderate - resolution spectra .",
    "this component is redshifted from systemic by 180  km  s@xmath2 , and has a ( resolution - corrected ) fwhm of 32  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the fwhm from the moderate - resolution data is larger by 50@xmath21 .",
    "this component is also observed in  k at moderate resolution .",
    "since this component is infalling and has a small velocity width , and given the origin of most ulirgs in a major merger ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we suggest that this component represents tidal debris falling back on to the galaxy .",
    "what motions cause the linewidths we observe ? if clouds or filaments entrained in these outflows are dominated by internal thermal motions , we should not expect to resolve them .",
    "( the thermal linewidth for na is 2.5  km  s@xmath2  in a @xmath22  k gas . )",
    "however , the smallest velocity fwhm we observe is a factor of 10 above this limit , and twice the spectral resolution .",
    "individual velocity components must therefore be a superposition of many clouds with different central velocities .",
    "the different velocities of these clouds are due to the motions of the wind that spread the clouds over both velocity space and real space , as seen in many simulations and observations .",
    "fortunately , such an ensemble can often be properly treated as a single component as we have done @xcite .",
    "we observe only two components that have a fwhm smaller than 100  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "dwarf starbursts have many components with fwhm @xmath23  km  s@xmath2 , but the velocities of their outflows are smaller than in infrared - luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "the larger average linewidths in ulirgs ( fwhm @xmath24 330  km  s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) than in dwarf galaxies ( 40  km  s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) are a consequence of the larger energy reservoirs available to power the outflows in infrared - luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "a near - field example of cloud ensembles resolved into individual components are the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) in our galaxy . very high resolution ( 2  km  s@xmath2 )  d  observations of intermediate- and high - velocity clouds resolve structures with linewidths down to the resolution limit , embedded in blended spectral structures as wide as 20  km  s@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "a width of 2  km  s@xmath2  is consistent with the thermal linewidth of na at @xmath22  k , but implies some turbulent broadening ( or accumulation of smaller cloudlets ) if the temperature is lower than this .",
    "because of their proximity , hvc cloudlets are known to be distinct not only in velocity space , but also in real space .",
    "@xcite find that hvcs , which have neutral hydrogen linewidths of tens of km  s@xmath2  when observed over large angular scales , have much smaller linewidths ( a few km  s@xmath2 ) on small angular scales ( 1@xmath25 ) .    envisioning the  d  absorption in infrared - luminous galaxies as an ensemble of small clouds",
    ", we can make an estimate of the number of clouds present in the line of sight .",
    "we compute this number by dividing the total column density in an average ensemble ( velocity component ) by the column density of an average cloud ( each computed using eq . [",
    "10 ] of @xcite ) . for a cloud ,",
    "we assume an average @xmath26 and @xmath27  km  s@xmath2  based on observations of high - velocity clouds @xcite , and for ulirgs we measure @xmath28 and @xmath29  km  s@xmath2  ( table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the average number of clouds in a ulirg velocity component is then 900 clouds , with a 1@xmath14 range of @xmath30 clouds .",
    "the number ( 230 ) of warm ionized clouds or resolved structures seen in high - resolution hst observations of ngc 3079 , a well - known local galaxy hosting a superwind @xcite , falls in the low end of this range",
    ". we would expect our estimate for ulirgs to be on average larger , given that the cloud properties we assume are based on observations of very small structures in the galaxy .",
    "we have performed observations at very high spectral resolution ( @xmath3  km  s@xmath2 ) of the  d  doublet in five infrared - luminous galaxies in order to confirm or deny measurements made at moderate resolution .",
    "we find that the resulting column densities are consistent within the errors with previous measurements .",
    "thus , the results of previous and forthcoming studies of the  d  feature are reliable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "they find that superwinds in infrared - luminous galaxies are massive and occur with high frequency .",
    "the impact of these winds on galaxy evolution and the intergalactic medium , especially at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) , is likely to be substantial .",
    "our observations of the  d  doublet do not clearly resolve any new outflowing components in these galaxies .",
    "one redshifted component is newly resolved ; we associate this component with tidal debris from a merger .",
    "these results are consistent with the lack of narrow components ( fwhm @xmath31  km  s@xmath2 ) in nearby dwarf starbursts @xcite .",
    "our data are consistent with a model in which an absorber is composed of many clouds ( @xmath51000 ) that fill the line of sight and form a large ensemble that enters our fits as a single absorbing ` component . '",
    "d  observations of high - velocity clouds in our galaxy resolve cloudlets with an average width of fwhm @xmath32  km  s@xmath2 , and these cloudlets may be similar to clouds that exist in superwinds .",
    "however , motions that separate the clouds in velocity and real space clearly dominate the linewidth of an individual velocity component ( fwhm @xmath33  km  s@xmath2 ) .",
