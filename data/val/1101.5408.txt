    "there has been a significant sensitivity improvement of the gravitational wave detectors since the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  @xcite and virgo observatory  @xcite started their operation . in 2007",
    "ligo and virgo completed the two year run at sensitivity that allows detection of a merger of two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) as far as @xmath0  mpc away  @xcite . in the most recent run ( may 2009 - october 2010 )",
    "the binary neutron star horizon distance has been increased to @xmath1  mpc . however , even at this impressive sensitivity , the anticipated detection rate with the initial ligo and virgo detectors is quite low .",
    "a detection may be possible in the case of a rare astrophysical transient event such as a supernova explosion in our galaxy or a nearby merger of binary neutron stars .",
    "the signal is likely to be weak and it will be difficult to prove its astrophysical origin unless it is confirmed with a coincident observation of the electromagnetic or neutrino counterpart .",
    "for this reason the ligo and virgo collaborations are conducting a wide range of joint observations  @xcite with other astrophysical experiments including radio  @xcite , optical and x - ray telescopes  @xcite , and neutrino detectors  @xcite .",
    "a more robust detection of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources is anticipated in the next five years as advanced ligo and advanced virgo come online .",
    "numerous gw signals , expected to be observed by advanced detectors ( likely @xmath1 ns - ns events per year  @xcite ) , will begin our exploration of the gravitational - wave sky and start the era of the gravitational wave astronomy .",
    "along with the advanced gw detectors , a new generation of optical telescopes will come online  @xcite , which will enable a wide and deep survey of the electromagnetic sky .",
    "joint observations with the advanced gravitational wave detectors and electromagnetic instruments will not only increase the confidence of detection but also bring fundamentally new information about the gw sources .",
    "they will reveal the physics and dynamic of sources , provide the identification of host galaxies and the associated redshifts , and in some cases determine luminosity distance to the source .",
    "one of the major challenges for such joint observations is to establish unambiguous association between a gravitational wave signal and a possible electromagnetic counterpart .",
    "it greatly depends on the ability of the gw networks to reconstruct sky coordinates of a detected gw source .",
    "given an accurate sky location , a corresponding electromagnetic transient may be identified in a list of events obtained with the all - sky telescope surveys , or the em instruments can be guided to take images of a small area in the sky . in the second case , it is important that the sky localization is performed by gw detectors in real time with low latency .",
    "the efficiency of the gw - em association and the choice of a partner telescope is affected by the sky localization error which should be well within the instrument s field of view ( typically less than few square degrees ) . moreover , exploring smaller area in the sky will decrease the probability of the false association .",
    "the problem of the source localization with networks of gw detectors is in the focus of research in the gravitational wave data analysis .",
    "there are several analytical studies  @xcite of this problem considering geometrical reconstruction of source coordinates based on the triangulation , which requires a measurement of the arrival time of a gw signal at different detectors",
    ". however , the accurate timing of the gw signal is intimately related to the reconstruction of the signal waveforms . due to the different detector sensitivities to the gw polarizations , the waveforms recorded by individual detectors may be different and they may not have a common timing reference ( like a signal peak time ) for a direct measurement of the differences in the arrival time .",
    "therefore , the problem of the source localization is better addressed in the framework of the coherent network analysis  @xcite , which reconstructs the waveforms and the sky coordinates simultaneously . by using both these methods ( triangulation and coherent network analysis ) , several practical source localization algorithms  @xcite have been recently developed and used during the ligo and virgo data taking runs in 2009 - 2010 .",
    "there have been a number of studies addressing benefits of individual detectors  @xcite and various detector networks  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a simulation study of the source localization and the reconstruction of gw waveforms with the networks of advanced detectors .",
    "the study is performed with a coherent network method , called coherent waveburst  @xcite ( cwb ) , based on the likelihood analysis . in cwb the data from all detectors in the network",
    "is processed simultaneously in order to reconstruct a common gw signal which is consistent with the recorded detector responses .",
    "the consistency is measured by the likelihood ratio , which is a function of the source parameters ( waveforms and sky location ) .",
    "the most probable source parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood ratio over the signal waveforms and sky coordinates .",
    "the method performs reconstruction of unmodeled burst signals ( arbitrary waveforms ) and signals with a certain polarization state : elliptical , linear and circular .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "possible networks of advanced detectors and their fundamental properties are descussed in section  [ sec : networks ] . in sections  [ sec :",
    "algorithm ] we describe the reconstruction algorithm . the simulation framework for this study",
    "is presented in section  [ framework ] .",
    "the results are reported in section  [ results ] . in sections  [ limitation ] and  [ conclusions ]",
    "we describe main factors limiting the source reconstruction and discuss the results .",
    "[ network ]    in 2001 - 2010 the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) and the virgo collaboration operated a network of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors which are the most sensitive instruments from the first generation of the gw interferometers ( 1 g ) .",
    "they consist of power - recycled michelson interferometers with kilometer - scale fabry - perot arms designed to detect gravitational waves with frequencies between tens of hz and several khz .",
    "the two ligo observatories  @xcite are in hanford , washington ( 4  km and 2  km detectors ) and in livingston , louisiana ( 4  km detector ) , and the 3-km virgo detector  @xcite is located in cascina , italy .",
    "other gravitational waves interferometers are the 300 m detector tama  @xcite in mitaka , japan , and the 600 m detector geo600  @xcite in hannover , germany . currently all 1 g interferometers are decommissioned , except virgo and geo600 , which continue to take data .",
    "the second - generation gw detectors ( 2 g ) are currently under construction .",
    "they include the advanced ligo detectors  @xcite , and the advanced virgo detector ( v )  @xcite which will have by an order of magnitude better sensitivity than the 1 g detectors .",
    "all advanced ligo detectors have 4-km long arms , with one detector in livingston ( l ) and two identical co - aligned detectors in hanford ( h and h ) . also there are plans to build the large cryogenic gravitational telescope ( lcgt )  @xcite in japan ( the j detector ) and possibly move the ligo h detector to a site in australia  @xcite ( the a detector ) . figure  [ fig:2gsensitivities ] shows the design sensitivity for the listed 2 g detectors .",
    "these , hopefully all five interferometers , compose the most advanced gw detector network which will be in operation after 2015 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]      there are several factors limiting the accuracy of the coordinate and waveform reconstruction due to the cwb algorithm . for high snr events the coordinate resolution is limited by the cwb sky segmentation which is @xmath2 degrees . therefore the error angle can not be less than @xmath3 degrees .",
    "also for the high frequency events the coordinate resolution is limited by the discrete time delays @xmath4 ( see section  [ sec : algorithm ] ) with the step of 1/16384 seconds and by the accuracy of the time delay filter ( few percent ) used in the analysis .",
    "also in the analysis we did not use any unmodeled constraint specific for individual networks , which , in principle , may improve reconstruction .",
    "these limitations are not fundamental and the algorithm performance can be improved in the future .",
    "in the paper we present the results of the source localization and reconstruction of gw waveforms with the networks of gw interferometers . for a general characterization of the detector networks we introduce few fundamental network parameters , including the effective noise , and the network antenna and alignment factors .",
    "the effective power spectral density of the network noise determines the average network snr for a given population of gw signals . for each direction in the sky",
    "the network performance is characterized by its antenna and alignment factors .",
    "the antenna factor describes how uniform is the network response across the sky .",
    "the alignment factor , which strongly depends on the number of detectors and the orientation of their arms , determines the relative contribution of the two gw polarizations into the total network snr .",
    "it requires several non - aligned detectors ( preferably more than three ) for a robust detection and reconstruction of both gw components .",
    "the coordinate reconstruction strongly depends on the signal waveforms , network snr and the number of detector sites in the network .",
    "the reconstruction can be significantly improved when it is constrained by the signal model .",
    "although a crude coordinate reconstruction ( ring in the sky ) is possible with the networks of two spatially separated sites , at least three detector sites are required to perform the source localization .",
    "the accuracy of the localization dramatically increases for networks with more than three sites , particularly for the low snr events .",
    "for example , the lhhv and lhva networks are expected to have about the same detection rates , however , the 4-site lhva network would have much better performance for the accurate reconstruction of gw signals .",
    "the pointing resolution required for joint observations with the electromagnetic telescopes is achievable with the networks consisting of four sites .",
    "the lhvaj network demonstrates further improvements , both in the detection and reconstruction of gw signals , reaching a sub - degree angular resolution .",
    "in addition , due to the limited duty cycle of the detectors , both the lcgt and the australian detectors will significantly increase the observation time when any of 4-site networks are operational .",
    "the advanced ligo and virgo detectors are very capable of the first direct detection of gravitational waves .",
    "however , for better reconstruction of the gw signals more detectors are required .",
    "extra detectors introduce an important redundancy which lower the impact of limited duty cycle of the detectors , makes the coordinate reconstruction more accurate , and less dependent on the waveform morphology and calibration uncertainties .",
    "the construction of the lcgt and the detector in australia will significantly enhance the advanced ligo - virgo network and these detectors will play a vital role in the future gw astronomy .",
    "the authors are thankful to the ligo - australia committee members r.  weiss , p.  saulson , s.  sathyaprakash , f.  raab , p.  fritschel and s.  finn for useful discussion of the results . also the authors appreciate suggestions by l.  bildsten on better presentation of the results , particularly in figure  [ larshistograms ] .",
