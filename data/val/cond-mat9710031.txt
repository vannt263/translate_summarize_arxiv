    "recently there has been intensive investigation@xmath0 of the influence of external electric fields on semiconductor superlattices .",
    "the availability of high - quality semiconductor superlattices , the possible practical application of new phenomena , and the surge of new interesting theoretical predictions have attracted both theoretical and experimental attention to this active field .",
    "an important example is bloch oscillation@xcite ( bo ) , one of the earliest predictions of the band theory of solids .",
    "its observation in standard crystalline solids has been prevented@xcite by excessive scattering under all practical conditions .",
    "but in semiconductor superlattices bos have not only been observed experimentally@xcite but have been further exploited to make an extremely fast emitter of electromagnetic radiation  the  bloch oscillator\"@xcite .",
    "many other new phenomena have been predicted theoretically and/or observed experimentally , including negative differential conductivity@xcite , absolute negative conductance@xcite , inverse bloch oscillation ( strong thz - photocurrent resonance at the bloch frequency)@xcite , dynamic localization@xcite , band collapse@xcite , band suppression@xcite , fractional wannier - stark ladders@xcite , and multi - photon absorption@xcite .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "the simplest models involve only a single miniband . but these miss all interesting interband phenomena , which are captured most simply in a two band tight binding model first introduced@xcite by fukuyama , bari and fogedby .",
    "this model contains the essential physics of interband transitions , and can be compared in practice with realistic situations@xcite where only a single pair of bands is important .",
    "rotvig , jauho and smith@xcite have studied coherent transport of one - dimensional semiconductor superlattices within this model .",
    "they found that coherent oscillation between the minibands can occur at special values of the applied field , where there are avoided crossings of the two interpenetrating wannier - stark ladders ( wsl ) arising essentially from different bands@xcite .",
    "these are the so - called zener resonances . for electric field values between zener resonances",
    "there are stable plateaus , where the relative population of the two bands is only weakly dependent on time . in each plateau",
    "there are small amplitude bloch oscillations .",
    "the number of these , @xmath1 , corresponds to the @xmath1th zener resonance@xcite ( labelled with _ decreasing _ field , so that the @xmath1th resonance arises from aligning adjacent wsl levels in quantum wells @xmath1 lattice spacings apart ) .    in this paper , using the same model , we study the effects of scattering from lattice imperfections on the dynamics of electrons , using a stochastic liouville equation for the density matrix , with markoffian dephasing . by means of both analytic and numerical calculations",
    "we analyse the effects of scattering and miniband structure parameters on the time evolution of @xmath2 , the difference in electron population of the two minibands .",
    "in contrast to previous work@xcite , in which the single quasimomentum component @xmath3 was studied , we focus on the trace quantity @xmath4 .",
    "there are two reasons for this choice .",
    "the first is that the temporal evolution of the sum over all quasimomenta is of direct physical interest , describing the dynamics of the full set of electrons .",
    "the individual @xmath3 depend not only on time but on quasimomentum @xmath5 , so we should integrate @xmath3 over the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the other is that , with scattering , @xmath5 is no longer a good quantum number  even in a suitable transverse gauge ( see ref .   and eqs .",
    "( 17 ) - ( 19 ) below ) , where @xmath5 _ is _ a good quantum number in the perfect lattice .",
    "we find that with no dissipation @xmath6 periodically oscillates between 1 and @xmath7 (  rabi flop \" between the initial condition of all electrons in one band and a fixed maximum exchange of a fraction of that population with the other band : @xmath8 ) at avoided crossings , whereas when dephasing is introduced , the electrons initially assumed to be located in one miniband will ultimately be distributed equally between the two bands ( band localization will be completely destroyed ) .    in section",
    "ii , we present the model and derive the equation of motion in @xmath5 space .",
    "section iii provides numerical analysis of the effects of the single relaxation rate and of the miniband parameters on the zener resonances .",
    "section iv contains the perturbative calculation of the density matrix and its limiting long - time behavior .",
    "we make some concluding remarks in section v.",
    "we consider the standard tight - binding model of a two - band system in a static electric field e. the model hamiltonian@xcite can be written as @xmath9 .",
    "\\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the subscripts label the lattice sites and the lower and upper minibands are designated by symbols @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we have introduced the notation @xmath12 for the bloch frequency , which will appear often below .",
    "the first two terms describe the site energies of the wannier states in the presence of the electric field , and @xmath13 are the widths of the isolated ( @xmath14 ) minibands induced by nearest neighbor hopping : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the lattice constant .",
    "the last term is the on - site electric dipole coupling between minibands ; @xmath17 is the corresponding dipole moment .",
    "this hamiltonian does neglect coulomb interactions and electric dipole elements between wannier states on different sites , but it contains the essential physics for the problem@xcite .",
    "note that the hopping parameters @xmath13 are written here with opposite signs , so that with both parameters positive the band structure at @xmath18 is of the standard nearly free electron character , with direct band gaps at the zone boundary .",
    "but the calculation to follow is valid for arbitrary signs of the parameters .",
    "it is easily shown@xcite that the exact spectrum of @xmath19 is two interpenetrating wannier - stark ladders .",
    "but what do the corresponding states represent in terms of the occupation of the original bands as a function of time , and what is the influence of scattering ?",
    "for vanishing dipole matrix element between bands , @xmath20 , there is no interband mixing .",
    "each of the two bands gives rise to a single wsl .",
    "clearly , when the electric field amplitude is such that the ladders become degenerate , even small values of @xmath21 lead to strong interband mixing .",
    "the crossing of the ladders is  avoided \" by any finite @xmath21 , and the behavior at those avoided crossings ( the zener resonances ) is of particular importance and interest .",
    "we start by defining the density matrix in the representation of the two bands ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 or @xmath24 are band indices : @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) designate @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) , respectively . within a constant relaxation rate approximation@xcite , the density matrix @xmath33 satisfies the following stochastic liouville equation ( sle ) ( we set @xmath34 throughout this paper ) , @xmath35-i\\gamma \\rho(t).\\ ] ] here @xmath36 describes the relaxation of the off - diagonal elements of @xmath37 through dephasing : @xmath38 the utility of this simplest form of the sle has been discussed by kenkre and collaborators ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "the parameters @xmath39 measure the loss of phase coherence between sites , or the scattering lifetime of band states labeled by quasimomentum .",
    "the relaxation to zero of the lattice site off - diagonal elements of @xmath37 is then effectively an infinite temperature approximation .",
    "the finite temperature corrections are essential@xcite to understanding the current response to an electric field , a response which vanishes in the absence of a difference in thermal equilibrium population between states of different energy , but those corrections should not play a major role in the phenomena studied here .",
    "we note that in this limit there is no need to distinguish@xcite between the relaxation rates of energy and momentum .",
    "since we are interested in the dynamics of occupation of various band states , it is convenient to work in a wave vector basis , by fourier transforming the density matrix . in general , since @xmath40 is not translationally invariant ( a function only of @xmath41 ) , we have a full set @xmath42 $ ] of fourier components .",
    "but we will be interested in the wave vector diagonal band occupation numbers @xmath43 .",
    "these evolve according to the corresponding fourier transform of the sle :    @xmath44\\nonumber\\\\ & & -i\\alpha_{11}\\rho^{11}(k , t ) + i\\alpha_{11}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\frac{dk'}{2\\pi}~\\rho^{11}(k',t)~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath45\\nonumber\\\\ & & -i\\alpha_{22}\\rho^{22}(k , t ) + i\\alpha_{22}\\int_0^{2\\pi}\\frac{dk'}{2\\pi}~\\rho^{22}(k',t)~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath46\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\bigl(\\delta - w\\cos k\\bigr ) \\rho^{12}(k , t ) -i\\alpha_{12}\\rho^{12}(k , t)~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath47\\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\bigl(\\delta - w\\cos k\\bigr ) \\rho^{21}(k , t )   -i\\alpha_{21}\\rho^{21}(k , t)~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have adopted the notation @xmath48 and @xmath49 . by introducing    @xmath50~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and , for simplicity , taking @xmath51 to reduce the number of parameters in the theory , we obtain    @xmath52~,\\ ] ]    @xmath53~,\\ ] ]    @xmath54    @xmath55    the equation for @xmath56 describes particle conservation .",

    ", we turn to numerical solutions .",
    "in this section we focus on the influence of dissipation on @xmath6 , the difference in population between the two minibands . for further simplicity the relaxation rates @xmath67 and",
    "@xmath68 have been set equal , @xmath69 , in the following .",
    "we emphasize again that due to scattering , the time dependences of @xmath70 and @xmath71 as described in eqs .",

    "some one - component diagonal terms @xmath72 undergo rabi oscillation@xcite  i.e. , @xmath72 oscillates between @xmath73 and @xmath74 with a period approximately determined by the value given in ref . , if we choose the electric field at a value corresponding to one of the avoided crossings of the two interpenetrating wannier - stark ladders . but",
    "further analysis shows that for some other wave vectors @xmath72 will _ not _ undergo complete rabi oscillations ( will not reach the full extreme values of @xmath75 ) , even if we choose the electric field to be at the avoided crossings .",
    "this is depicted in the lower panels of both figs . 1 and 2 , which differ only by the choice of system parameters , listed in the figure captions . the upper panel in each corresponds to @xmath76 and the lower panel to @xmath77 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that @xmath78 falls short of the minimum value of -1 in both cases .",
    "but , for the parameters of fig",
    ". 2 , the minimum is more closely approached than it is in fig .",
    "1 , although in fig . 2 interband communication has been decreased .",
    "this can be understood by making the coordinate transformation @xmath79 in eqs .",
    "( 17 ) - ( 19 ) ( with no relaxation : @xmath80 ) .",
    "then all quantities depend only on the single parameter @xmath81 : @xmath82 .",
    "the initial conditions are set at a time @xmath83 and therefore are still @xmath5 dependent in terms of @xmath81 .",
    "but when @xmath84 is very large , we have @xmath85 , so that @xmath72 , @xmath86 , and @xmath71 will be independent of @xmath5 . then all @xmath72 will approximately undergo full rabi oscillations .",
    "in general this is the dominant reason that @xmath6 , which represents a sum over all wave vectors , oscillates between certain negative values ( but never reaches @xmath74 ) and @xmath73 , no matter how we choose the electric field .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "3a , where we use the same parameters as those of fig .",
    "1 . in this figure , zener tunneling and the more rapid bo",
    "can both still be clearly identified , but some oscillations in the stable plateaus have been smeared out . in particular , when @xmath6 reaches @xmath73 , only a single sharp cusp has survived . the smearing is due to interference between the bo s for different values of @xmath5 , which appear in slightly different positions , as can be seen by comparing the upper and lower panels of figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "this interference is also a factor ( but not the main one ) in suppressing the minimum of @xmath6 from @xmath74 at zener resonances .",
    "with the introduction of dissipation the dynamics change dramatically ( even in the regime where the scattering rate is less than the bloch frequency , @xmath87 , so that some bo s remain well defined ; we will treat only this regime@xcite ) .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "3b , where we use the same parameters as in fig .",
    "3a except that @xmath88 instead of zero . in this figure",
    ", we see that @xmath6 still oscillates between negative and positive values , but the oscillation amplitude decreases strikingly with increasing time .",
    "plateaus can still be identified in several earlier peaks of the envelopes , but the bo s are increasingly suppressed in successive plateaus .",
    "if we choose the ratio @xmath89 larger ( e.g. , @xmath90 in fig .",
    "3c , where we use the same other parameters as in fig . 3a ) , a few bo s can be seen but @xmath6 never becomes negative .",
    "this demonstrates that observation of rabi oscillations is in general more difficult than that of bo .    in the absence of scattering",
    "we can localize the electrons in one of the minibands simply by choosing the electric field amplitude to be well away from the avoided crossings .",
    "this can be seen through numerical calculation of @xmath6 .",
    "however , the introduction of dephasing destroys this picture completely . for _ any _ value of the electric field",
    "the electron density will be distributed equally between the two minibands at long times .",
    "this can be seen clearly by comparing figs . 4a and 4b , where we use the same superlattice parameters as in fig . 2 , and the bo frequency @xmath91 has been changed from the value at an avoided crossing of 10.2 mev to @xmath92 mev . in fig .",
    "4a there is no dissipation , while in fig .",
    "4b , @xmath93 .",
    "under certain conditions perturbative calculations can give some useful results . setting @xmath94 and recalling @xmath95 , we can rewrite the eqs .

    "when the scattering rate @xmath119 becomes smaller , the peaks in @xmath120 become higher and sharper ( half width in @xmath117 of order @xmath121 ) , as one expects intuitively .",
    "note that the decay time @xmath113 in the figure is always longer than the scattering time @xmath122 , even at the peaks , which was tacitly assumed in setting @xmath123 at the dominant ( smallest negative @xmath124 ) pole in ( 29 ) above .",
    "we have discussed the dynamics of electrons in a two - band superlattice under the influence of static electric fields , with markoffian dephasing .",
    "we have given both analytic and numerical analyses of the effects of scattering and miniband structure on the zener resonances and miniband localization .",
    "we found that dephasing will ultimately force the electrons initially located in one miniband to populate equally the two minibands . under conditions of small interband coupling , and in the long time limit , we obtain the effective decay rate , whose sharp peaks are a signature of zener resonances .",
    "experimentally the phenomena predicted in this paper are accessible in semiconductor superlattices with wells of dimensions on the order of 100 angstroms and electric fields of a few kilovolts per cm .",
    "this superlattice can be grown dimerized , with the unit cell consisting , e.g. , of a pair of quantum wells , separated from the adjacent pair by a wider barrier than that which separates the two wells of the basis pair",
    ". then the lowest level of an individual well is split within the basis pair .",
    "these two levels form a pair of minibands in the superlattice which is well separated energetically from higher levels , and all but that pair can reasonably be neglected in studying the dominant electron dynamics@xcite .",
    "then we can probe radiation induced by the oscillating dipole associated with rabi flop in this system@xcite .",
    "work is under way to extend these results to understand the influence of scattering on the behavior of a semiconductor superlattice in the presence of strong time periodic , as well as static , electric fields .",
    "of particular practical interest are superlattices subjected to the terahertz radiation of a free electron laser .",

    "<S> we also obtain the effective decay time for the approach to equal band populations under conditions of small interband communication and in the long - time limit , through a perturbative calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the decay rate shows characteristic sharp peaks at values of the parameters which give zener resonances . </S>"
