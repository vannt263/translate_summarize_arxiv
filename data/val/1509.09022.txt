    "liquids are unable to sustain any nonzero _ stationary _ shear stress . in ordinary conditions  i.e . , at small enough strain rates  shear relaxation occurs exponentially fast , producing a viscoelastic analog of the dielectric debye relaxation .",
    "however , at the crossover between the characteristic shearing time and the liquid relaxation time @xcite , distinctive solidlike features become increasingly manifest @xcite .",
    "molecular rearrangements are dramatically slowed down in confined ultrathin liquid films ( three to ten molecular dimensions thick ) , whose relaxation times may be as large as tens to hundreds of milliseconds @xcite , making the crossover more experimentally accessible . but clear fingerprints of a smooth transition from liquidlike to solidlike response manifest also in the acoustic properties of nematic liquid crystals ( nlcs ) in the mhz  ghz frequency range .    in this paper",
    "we show how a fairly general continuum theory of liquids may be established by allowing the _ effective _ shear strain  i.e .",
    ", the shear strain from an evolving _ relaxed configuration_to enter the strain energy functional .",
    "a dissipation principle governs the evolution of such a configuration , and it takes into account the macroscopic effects of microscopic rearrangements @xcite . in a previous work @xcite , we constructed such a theory for ( slightly ) compressible nlcs and applied it , with fair success , to explain quantitatively the anisotropy of sound velocity @xcite and sound attenuation @xcite in @xmath0-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline ( mbba ) over the range 214 mhz .",
    "the theory of nematic relaxation put forth in @xcite is characterized by : ( i ) a neo - hookean contribution to the strain energy where the effective shear strain enters weighted by an anisotropic shape tensor , and ( ii ) an isotropic gradient flow dynamics for the relaxed configuration , parameterized by a single viscosity modulus . here",
    "we keep ( i ) as is , but we revise and extend ( ii ) by taking a gradient flow with respect to an anisotropic metric possessing the minimum symmetry compatible with the liquid crystal .",
    "this theory covers the whole range from low - frequency hydrodynamics to solidlike high - frequency regimes .",
    "in particular , the low - frequency predictions reproduce the well - known ericksen - leslie @xcite dynamical theory , but they deliver in addition a new parodi - like relation between viscosity coefficients . along with the original parodi relation @xcite which",
    "we also retrieve  this result lowers to _ four _ the number of independent viscosities for a nematic liquid crystal .",
    "both conditions involve only ( some of ) the six original leslie coefficients , not the extra three viscosities entering the extension of the ericksen - leslie theory to compressible nlcs .",
    "accordingly , only the theory for incompressible nlcs will be presented here , and its predictions tested against experimental data , earlier theoretical predictions , and results from molecular - dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "the discussion of the compressible case is left to a future paper .",
    "we briefly sketch the theory that provides the equations of motion for a nlc , under the combined effect of anisotropic elasticity and anisotropic relaxation .",
    "let @xmath1 be the deformation gradient from an arbitrarily selected reference configuration of the nlc body . to account for relaxation ,",
    "we factorize @xmath1 into a _ relaxing deformation _ @xmath2 and an _ effective deformation _",
    "@xmath3 : @xmath4 with @xmath2 identifying the relaxed equilibrium configuration , and the effective deformation @xmath3 measuring the deviation from equilibrium of the current deformation . consequently , only the effective deformation enters the strain energy . since @xmath5 maps from the relaxed to the current configuration , the strain energy is properly defined , being independent of the arbitrarily chosen reference . for an incompressible nlc ,",
    "all factors in are isochoric , i.e. , have unit determinant .    in order to account for anisotropic elasticity ,",
    "we augment the classical oseen - frank @xcite free - energy density ( per unit volume ) with the anisotropic potential @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the shear modulus .",
    "the strain energy simply measures the deviation of the _ effective strain _",
    "@xmath8 from the _ energetic shape tensor _",
    "@xmath9 parameterized by the _ aspect ratio _ @xmath10 , whose deviation from  @xmath11 gauges the degree and the type ( prolate or oblate ) of elastic anisotropy with respect to the nematic director @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the shape tensor @xmath13 is symmetric , positive definite , and with unit determinant .",
    "the potential @xmath14 adds the following contribution to the stress tensor @xcite : @xmath15 clearly , @xmath16 vanishes if and only if @xmath17 , where @xmath14 attains its unique minimum .",
    "we now proceed to derive an evolution equation for the relaxing deformation @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath18 , with the _ inverse relaxing strain _ defined as @xmath19 , the strain energy density depends on the relaxing deformation @xmath2 only through @xmath20 .",
    "any relaxation dynamics necessarily obeys a dissipation inequality , ensuring a nonnegative entropy production . in this case",
    ", such an inequality reads @xmath21 ( see @xcite ) . in terms of the _ co - deformational derivative _",
    "@xmath22 where @xmath23 is the translational velocity field and @xmath24 is its spatial gradient , inequality takes the form @xmath25 made stricter by the presumption that relaxation does dissipate . the simplest way to satisfy",
    "it is to assume that there is an invertible _ dissipation tensor _ @xmath26 whose symmetric part is positive definite , such that @xmath27 where the lagrange multiplier @xmath28 enforces the condition that the relaxation process be isochoric . after introducing the _ mobility tensor _ @xmath29 , this yields the gradient - flow equation @xcite @xmath30 note that , contrary to @xmath20 , the effective strain @xmath31 is independent of the arbitrarily chosen reference .",
    "hence , the relaxation dynamics is properly defined .",
    "the most general dissipation tensor @xmath26 sharing the symmetry of the shape tensor may be parameterized by six scalar coefficients @xmath32 , as @xcite @xmath33 it depends on the aspect ratio @xmath34 via @xmath13 , and possibly also via the coefficients @xmath32 .",
    "generically , @xmath26 has two double eigenvalues : @xmath35 associated respectively with the shearing modes in the plane normal to @xmath12 and the shearing modes that tilt the nematic director .",
    "their inverses measure how fast these modes relax . on the ( complementary ) invariant subspace spanned by the orthonormal pair @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath26 acts as follows @xmath38 = \\begin{pmatrix } \\tau_{11}&\\tau_{12}\\\\ \\tau_{21}&\\tau_{22 } \\end{pmatrix},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "where @xmath39 & \\tfrac12(\\tau_{12}+\\tau_{21})= \\sqrt{2}\\,\\frac{a^3 - 1}{3a^2}\\big(2\\,a\\,\\tau_2 + 3\\,a\\,\\tau_4+(1+a^3)\\,\\tau_5\\big)\\ , , \\\\[.5ex ] & \\tfrac12(\\tau_{12}-\\tau_{21})=\\sqrt{2}\\,\\frac{a^3 - 1}{a}\\,\\tau_6\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath40 under positivity conditions and , @xmath26 is invertible whatever the value of @xmath41 is . for @xmath42 ( a condition identifying an isotropic liquid ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 collapse into @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and reduces  to @xmath47 with @xmath48",
    "now that we have characterized both the elastic and the relaxational material properties , we set up a perturbative procedure fit to study the slow motions where the system is expected to comply with the ericksen - leslie hydrodynamics .",
    "the evolution equation has only one stationary solution : @xmath17 , which is globally attractive .",
    "therefore , if the deformation process is slow enough ( on the time scale set by the largest relaxation time characterizing @xmath26 ) , the ensuing viscous response is well described by linearizing the right side of about @xmath13 and assuming the deformation gradient to be _ retarded _ in the sense of : @xmath49 implying that @xmath50 and @xmath51 . under these assumptions , equation ,",
    "trivially satisfied at @xmath52 , at @xmath53 leads to @xmath54 which , substituted into , yields @xmath55 the co - deformational derivative of the shape tensor reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the co - rotational derivative of the nematic director , @xmath58 the ( traceless ) stretching , and @xmath59 is the spin .",
    "we are now in a position to compare our result with the most general linear viscous stress compatible with the nematic structure , as posited in @xcite , namely @xmath60 whose traceless component matches provided that the six leslie viscosities are identified as follows : @xmath61 , \\notag\\\\ \\alpha_2&=-\\mu\\,(a^3\\!-1)\\,a\\,\\tau_{\\perp } , \\notag\\\\[.5ex ] \\alpha_3&=-\\mu\\,(a^3\\!-1)\\,a^{-2}\\,\\tau_{\\perp } , \\label{eq : alphas}\\\\[.5ex ] \\alpha_4&=2\\,\\mu\\,a^{-2}\\,\\tau_{\\| } , \\notag\\\\[.5ex ] \\alpha_5&=\\mu\\big((a^3\\!+1)\\,a\\,\\tau_{\\perp}-2\\,a^{-2}\\,\\tau_{\\|}\\big ) , \\notag\\\\[.5ex ] \\alpha_6&=\\mu\\big((a^3\\!+1)\\,a^{-2}\\,\\tau_{\\perp}-2\\,a^{-2}\\,\\tau_{\\|}\\big).\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these viscosity coefficients satisfy identically the well - known parodi relation @xcite @xmath62 this should be expected , since @xmath41 , the only coefficient breaking the symmetry of @xmath26 , does not enter equalities @xcite .",
    "a far less obvious result is the new nonlinear relation involving all leslie viscosities but @xmath63 : @xmath64 and the fact that the cubic root of the two ratios equated in equals the aspect ratio @xmath34 : @xmath65 for @xmath42 ( implying @xmath66 and an _ isotropic _ free - energy density ) , all @xmath67 s vanish but @xmath68 .",
    "the is hence undefined . however , and still hold by continuity .",
    "parodi s relation , stemming from a general thermodynamic argument , is so well established that it is simply taken for granted by experimentalists who identify all of the six leslie coefficients in the absence of data from normal stress measurements @xcite .",
    "the new relation , on the contrary , is specific to the present theory of anisotropic nematic relaxation .",
    "checking against evidence from independent sources provides therefore a significant test of our theory .",
    "to do so , we have at our disposal both experimental and theoretical results , along with numerical simulations .",
    "more precisely , in what follows we analyze : ( i ) an early paper @xcite on md simulation of nlcs , inspired by the model molecular theory put forward by helfrich @xcite , and a relatively recent one @xcite , based on the gay - berne potential ; ( ii ) the experimental study @xcite universally regarded as the standard reference for the viscosities of mbba between @xmath69 and @xmath70c ; ( iii ) the outcome of a study on non - equilibrium statistical mechanics initiated by osipov and terentjev , extending previous results by kuzuu and doi ( see , in particular , the recent comprehensive review by chan and terentjev @xcite ) .    in @xcite ,",
    "baals and hess computed a complete set of viscosity coefficients by running a series of non - equilibrium md simulations on a small system comprised of 128 particles , interacting through either a lennard - jones ellipsoid or a soft ellipsoid ( purely repulsive ) potential and subjected to plane couette flows with various shear rates and different orientations relative to the uniform nematic direction , which was kept fixed in all runs .",
    "their results are immediately comparable with the predictions of our theory , both having been obtained for a perfectly aligned nematic fluid .",
    "the coefficients in @xcite may hence enter directly the left and right sides of equality , which happens to be satisfied remarkably well ( see table  [ tab : md ] ) .",
    "all remaining data are obtained for partially oriented ncls .",
    "nematic viscosities depend on the degree of nematic order essentially through the scalar _ maier - saupe order parameter _",
    "@xmath71 , ranging from 0 ( isotropic state ) to 1 ( perfect alignment ) . to compensate for the fact that our theory does not account for partial order",
    ", we obtain a crude reconstruction of the nominal values of nematic viscosities at @xmath72 from values measured for partially ordered nlcs by replacing each @xmath73 term in the viscous stress by the corresponding second - moment tensor @xmath74 @xcite and taking into account that the nematic contribution to the shear viscosity @xmath75 is overshadowed by a dominant isotropic contribution .    in @xcite , wu ,",
    "qian , and zhang performed non - equilibrium md simulations on a system of about 6,000 molecules , interacting via a gay - berne potential , for determining the six leslie coefficients for each of three different shear rates .",
    "their values , extrapolated from @xmath76 to @xmath11 through the above - described reconstruction procedure , show a striking agreement with relation ( see table  [ tab : md ] ) .    in @xcite , kneppe et al .",
    "provided a complete set of leslie coefficients for several temperature values ranging from @xmath69 to @xmath70c .",
    "fig.[fig : viscosities ] shows that the measured values may be satisfactorily fitted with our predictions , provided we assume that the leslie viscosities depend on the maier - saupe order parameter @xmath71 as discussed above , and @xmath71 itself depends on temperature as in table  [ tab : mbba ] .",
    "a remarkable exception is provided by the leslie coefficient @xmath77 , which deserves special attention .",
    "in fact , in @xcite the authors themselves raise a warning concerning this coefficient , which they derive as the difference of two nearly equal quantities , to the point that they hope for alternative measuring techniques .",
    "in particular , one of the striking peculiarities of the experimental @xmath77 estimate in @xcite is that , at variance with all other viscosities , it appears to increase when the degree of orientation decreases . on the contrary",
    ", our theory predicts a consistent temperature dependence for all nematic viscosities .",
    ".lje and se stand respectively for lennard - jones ellipsoid and soft ellipsoid potentials , as used in @xcite ; the shear rates used in @xcite are given in l - j reduced units .",
    "the third column , relative to parodi s relation , is provided as a term of comparison .",
    "the scatter of the results from @xcite is huge , due to the small size of the molecular sample . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a third and final test for our theoretical predictions comes from the non - equilibrium fokker - planck analysis developed in .",
    "this mean - field theory deals exclusively with the relaxational dynamics of the orientational degrees of freedom of anisotropic molecules to the exclusion of the translational relaxation associated with shear flow .",
    "consequently , it does not provide reliable predictions for the shear viscosity coefficient @xmath75 , and therefore it can not be used as a direct test for the new parodi - like relation .",
    "moreover , this theory delivers an explicit universal representation only for the symmetric part of the stress tensor , while the rotational viscosity @xmath78 ( and hence the complete set of leslie viscosities ) depends on the specific form of the assumed mean - field potential . that having been said , results in are in good qualitative agreement with our formulas with the obvious exception of @xmath75 .",
    "equality further allows us to establish a direct link between the aspect ratio @xmath34playing a key role in the present theory of nematic relaxation but not directly observable  and quantities amenable to experimental and numerical determination .",
    "the values obtained from data in @xcite are collected in the fourth column of table  [ tab : md ] .",
    "we have presented a hydrodynamic theory that accounts for both elastic and relaxational effects , based only on material symmetry requirements . when applied to nlcs in the low - frequency regime",
    ", this theory predicts another relation beyond parodi s linking the six leslie viscosities , thus lowering to four the number of independent nematic viscosities .",
    "our predictions are in remarkable quantitative accord with experimental measures on mbba and md simulations , and in fair qualitative agreement with earlier theoretical predictions .",
    "the basic tenet of our theory is the separation between equilibrium properties , encoded in the free energy functional , and non - equilibrium properties , encoded in the relaxation dynamics .",
    "correspondingly , the distinction between ` solid ' and ` liquid ' rests on the activated relaxation mechanisms , and not on the underlying energetics .",
    "in fact , the strain energy functional characterizing anisotropic elastic _ solids _ such as nematic elastomers and the anisotropic potential we use for nematic _ liquid _ crystals are formally alike .",
    "nlcs may be classified into two groups : _ flow - aligning _",
    "( such as mbba and 5cb ) and _ tumbling _ ( such as hbab and 8cb ) @xcite , characterized , respectively , by a positive or negative value of the _ tumbling parameter _ , @xmath79 since @xmath34 is intrinsically positive and reasonably greater than 1 , implies @xmath80 . therefore , our theory covers only flow - aligning nlcs . while narrowing its scope , this limitation makes it more specific .",
    "the hidden link between assumption and flow alignment surely deserves further study , as does a proper incorporation of the degree of nematic order .",
    "a separate issue we intend to address is removing the incompressibility constraint , paying due attention to the possible role of @xmath41 @xcite , in order to reconsider the nematoacoustic problem we tackled in @xcite .",
    "this paper is dedicated to jerry ericksen on the occasion of his 90th birthday .",
    "financial support from the italian ministero dellistruzione , delluniversit e della ricerca through the grant no.200959l72b004 `` mathematics and mechanics of biological assemblies and soft tissues '' , is gratefully acknowledged .",
