    "even with no interaction with the environment , errors in a quantum computer driven by radio - frequency ( _ rf _ ) pulses may be generated by the nonresonant action of these pulses on different spins .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "these errors depend on the value of the detuning from the resonant ( useful ) transitions .",
    "unwanted transitions with small detunings produce the largest errors .",
    "such transitions , called near - resonant transitions , are associated with interactions between the spins in the chain .",
    "these interactions are required in order to implement the conditional quantum logic .",
    "but the same interactions can cause unwanted transitions characterized by small detunings from resonance and relatively large probabilities .",
    "if one wants to flip the @xmath0th spin in a particular state and does not want to flip the same spin in the other state with different orientations of the neighboring @xmath1th and @xmath2th spins , then first of all one has to suppress these near - resonant transitions .",
    "for example , if the resonant transition is latexmath:[\\[\\label{transition }     near - resonant transitions to be suppressed are latexmath:[\\[\\label{transition1 }         complete suppression of near - resonant transitions for an arbitrary superposition of quantum sates in a scalable ising spin quantum computer was developed in @xcite .    since a wavelength of a _ rf _",
    "pulse is much larger than a distance between the spins , the pulse affects all spins in the chain .",
    "hence , in order to allow a selective excitation of the @xmath0th spin , one must make the larmor frequency of this particular spin different from the larmor frequencies of all other spins , and choose the frequency of the _ rf _ pulse to be equal to the transition frequency of this @xmath0th spin . in kane s @xcite semiconductor quantum computer proposal",
    "this can be done by applying a voltage to the @xmath0th qubit .",
    "the approach used in this paper , is to apply a permanent magnetic field with a large gradient in the direction of the spin chain @xcite .",
    "because of the magnetic field gradient , the magnetic field is different for different spins , so that each spin has its unique larmor frequency .",
    "however , the differences in larmor frequencies of different spins do not completely solve the problem of selective excitations .",
    "even if these differences are large , there are small probabilities of excitations of unwanted spins with large detunings .",
    "this problem is not very important in conventional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nor for a quantum computer with a small number of qubits , since the pulse sequences do not contain a very large number of pulses . unlike this , in a quantum computer with sufficiently large number of qubits",
    "the implementation of logic operations requires thousands of pulses .",
    "the errors caused by the nonresonant transitions , being small for a single pulse , in general grow linearly  @xcite with the number of pulses , so that eventually accumulation of this type of error would impose severe restrictions on the number of qubits in a nuclear or electron spin quantum computer .",
    "this problem is especially acute because there are no error correction codes for correction of this type of error .    in this paper",
    "we develop an approach which allows one to decrease significantly ( by 50% ) the probabilities of unwanted nonresonant transitions in order to decrease the errors caused by the _",
    "_ pulses of quantum protocols .",
    "our approach to this problem is similar to the method used for minimization of errors caused by the near - resonant transitions  @xcite .",
    "since the probabilities of unwanted nonresonant transitions oscillate in time with frequencies proportional to the differences in the larmor frequencies between the spins , one can select the optimal values of these frequency differences ( by applying a specific magnetic field gradient ) to minimize the nonresonant transitions . in spite of a rather refined character of our model ( in the sense that this system is complicated for the experimental realization with a solid - state device )",
