    "the primary effect of al-/c - substitution is a drop of t@xmath1 .",

    "since the high - temperature superconductivity of mgb@xmath0 originates from the strong e - ph coupling in @xmath3-bands , it is natural to ascribe the origin of decreasing t@xmath1 to the change of @xmath3-band properties .",
    "the two changes in the @xmath3-band electronic state can be considered .",
    "one is the band - filling , _",
    "i.e. _ the shift of the fermi level , which decreases the hole density of states @xmath39(@xmath40 ) and shrinks the cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "the other change is the increase of carrier scattering rate .",

    "resistivity and hall coefficient are affected by both of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-bands , although they show anisotropy . in the present study ,",
    "the change of @xmath41 can be seen in the weakening of e - ph coupling , because the @xmath42 is one of the parameters that determines the coupling constant @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "the suppression of e - ph coupling is clearly observed as the pronounced hardening and narrowing of e@xmath2-phonon in raman scattering spectra in fig.[raman_peak ] .",
    "the change of the @xmath3-band fermi surface would also reduce the e - ph coupling via the change of deformation potential .",
    "we note that the shift of e@xmath2-phonon frequency is stronger than the moderate change in @xmath39(@xmath40 ) at low c - contents",
    ". the observed decrease of t@xmath1 is not monotonous , but the smooth change becomes steeper as the substitution proceeds .",
    "this change in t@xmath1-suppression rate seems to be related to the calculated drop of @xmath42 by electron - doping @xcite .",
    "the band calculation predicts that superconductivity will be suppressed by @xmath250.25 electron doping per unit cell @xcite .",
    "the nearly suppressed t@xmath442 k at @xmath19=0.125 in our study roughly corresponds to this critical doping .",
    "another factor that should be discussed as an origin of decreasing t@xmath1 is the strong interband scattering @xcite that is related to the large increase of residual resistivity .",
    "when strong scattering is introduced , two - gap sc picture is no longer valid , and isotropic superconductivity with a single sc - gap is realized . as for c - substituted mgb@xmath0",
    ", the studies on polycrystalline samples have revealed that the two sc - gaps survive even in the sample with @xmath8 @xmath25 20 k @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the estimated t@xmath1 for a dirty - limit is about 20 k without change in n(@xmath40 ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the interband scattering is the primary origin of decreasing t@xmath1 for @xmath450.075 . at higher c - content @xmath460.10 ,",
    "on the other hand , the interband scattering may play some role . in such",
    "highly c - substituted crystal , the superconductivity becomes almost isotropic , although the anisotropic band structure is still suggested by the anisotropy of hall coefficients for @xmath19=0.125 . in order to explain the isotropic superconductivity with the anisotropic band structure ,",
    "the strong interband scattering scenario is preferable .",
    "interband scattering may be enhanced by induced disorder by c - substitution , such as buckling of the b - planes .",
    "accordingly , we conclude that both the decrease in @xmath43 and the increase in interband scattering rate contribute to the decrease of t@xmath1 , although the degree of contribution changes as a function of @xmath19 .    in order to extract the change of the @xmath3-bands , the critical field h@xmath7 provides useful information , because it is determined only by the @xmath3-band gap at h@xmath470.5 t @xcite .",
    "the increase of h@xmath32 is due to the increase of impurity scattering via the shortening of @xmath48 , as is expected from the relation @xmath49",
    "@xmath50 @xmath51 + @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is coherence length in clean - limit , and @xmath54 is mean - free path .",
    "the radical decrease of @xmath54 was clearly seen in fig.[rt ] , as an increase of residual resistivity . at @xmath19=0.05 , for example , the @xmath54 is one order shorter than that for @xmath19=0 , which results in the relation @xmath55 .",
    "the validity of dirty - limit picture was also demonstrated as the smearing of pair - breaking peak in the raman spectrum ( fig.[raman_gap ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy change in h@xmath30 can be explained by the anisotropic change of @xmath48 . as seen in fig.[xi ]",
    ", the anisotropy decrease is mainly due to the rapid shrink of @xmath33 .",
    "this indicates that the scattering rate for the @xmath3-band carriers increases in anisotropic way .",
    "since the c - substitution of atoms takes place on b - planes , it is likely that the introduced disorder should primarily affects the @xmath3-band conduction along the b - planes .",
    "in the heavily c - substituted crystals , where the remarkable decrease in @xmath28 elongates @xmath48 , interband scattering may additionally contribute to the isotropic sc - state , as observed in the crystal with @xmath19=0.10 and 0.125 .",
    "we have presented the electronic properties of carbon substituted mgb@xmath0 single crystals .",
    "the effects of c - substitution are two - fold .",
    "one is the increase of impurity scattering , and the other is the band filling that reduces @xmath56 and modifies the shape of fermi surface .",
    "the former increases rapidly the residual resistivity , enhances the the critical magnetic fields at t @xmath57 t@xmath1 , and smears out the pair - breaking peak in raman spectra .",
    "a predominant effect of the latter is the shift of the e@xmath2-peak , suggesting the weakening of e - ph coupling by c - substitution .",
    "this is the primary reason for the decrease of t@xmath1 .",
