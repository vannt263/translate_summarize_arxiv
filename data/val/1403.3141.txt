    "the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is a key stepping stone in establishing an accurate extragalactic distance ladder .",
    "the lmc is the nearest extragalactic environment that hosts statistically significant samples of the tracer populations that are commonly used for distance determinations , including cepheid and rr lyrae variable stars , eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) , and red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars , as well as supernova ( sn ) 1987a , among others",
    ". these could thus potentially link the fairly well - understood local ( solar - neighborhood and galactic ) tracers to their counterparts in more distant and more poorly resolved galaxies . in fact , at a distance of approximately 50 kpc , the lmc represents the only well - studied environment linking galactic distance tracers to those in other large spiral and elliptical galaxies at greater distances , including m31 at a distance of @xmath2780 kpc or a distance modulus of @xmath324.47 mag ( e.g. , freedman et al .",
    "2001 ; mcconnachie et al .",
    "yet , despite the plethora of studies claiming to have determined independent distance measurements to the lmc , lingering systematic uncertainties remain .",
    "this has prompted significant concern in the context of using the lmc distance as a calibrator to reduce the uncertainties in the hubble constant ( cf .",
    "freedman et al . 2001 ; schaefer 2008 ; pietrzyski et al . 2013 ) .",
    "it has also led to persistent claims of `` publication bias '' affecting published distances to the galaxy ( cf .",
    "schaefer 2008 , 2013 ; rubele et al . 2012 ; walker 2012 ) .    in general , publication bias is the tendency of researchers to publish results that conform to some extent to the norm , while ignoring outputs that may be of low(er ) significance or that deviate significantly from what is considered common knowledge in the relevant field . in other words ,",
    "the strongest or most significant results are included for publication , while the rest of a presumably much larger set of results remain unseen .",
    "this also means that this effect is notoriously difficult to correct for , because the underlying null results are usually not published .",
    "the phenomenon of publication bias is well - known to occur in statistics and among medical trials ( e.g. , sterling 1959 ; rosenthal 1979 ; begg & berlin 1988 ; naylor 1997 ; stern & simes 1997 ; sterne et al .",
    "2000 ) , where it could have potentially devastating effects on people s lives , or lead to ineffectual or even counterproductive treatments .",
    "liddle ( 2004 ) explains that `` [ p]ublication bias comes in several forms , for example if a single paper analyses several parameters , but then focusses attention on the most discrepant , that in itself is a form of bias .",
    "the more subtle form is where many different researchers examine different parameters for a possible effect , but only those who , by chance , found a significant effect for their parameter , decided to publicize it strongly .",
    "'' publication bias has also been claimed to occur in various fields related to astrophysics and cosmology , where in some cases efforts have also been made to correct for these effects ( see , e.g. , slosar & seljak 2004 ; slosar et al .",

    "2012 ) .",
    "in the context of the present paper , schaefer ( 2008 ) focused his analysis on published lmc distance determinations .",
    "he specifically addressed the question as to whether or not the publication of the final results of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( freedman et al .",
    "2001 ) had resulted in an unwarranted tightening up of the lmc s distance scale .",
    "he considered as possible causes of such a tightening correlations among published results , widespread overestimation of uncertainty ranges , bandwagon effects , or a combination of these scenarios .",
    "he concluded with a warning that the community would do well to be vigilant and redress the effects of publication bias , which he considered the most likely cause of the clustering of lmc distance measurements he reported to have occurred during the period from 2002 until june 2007 .    upon careful examination",
    ", however , we realized that schaefer s ( 2008 ) analysis  as well as his subsequent persistence in support of his 2008 conclusion that publication bias may have severaly affected the body of lmc distance measurements ( e.g. , schaefer 2013)was based on a number of simplifying assumptions :",
    "he concludes that the uncertainties in the post-2002 distance moduli are not distributed according to a gaussian distribution , which he flags as a problem .",
    "however , in such a scenario , the underlying assumptions are that ( i ) the pre-2001 values were , in fact , distributed in a gaussian fashion ( they are not , however , as we will show in section [ lmcdist.sec ] ) and ( ii ) conditions were comparable before and after the benchmark date .",
    "this latter assumption is likely also too simplistic , as we will argue in the context of cepheid - based distance determinations in section [ cepheids.sec ] .",
    "we recommend  and pursue in this paper  a more detailed analysis of the individual distance moduli contributing to the overall trends observed to assess whether or not publication bias truly is to blame .",
    "2 .   schaefer ( 2008 ) based his results on published values and their uncertainties ; the latter are , however , predominantly statistical uncertainties and the majority do _ not _ include systematic errors . only a few authors include the systematic errors affecting their lmc distance estimates , however . in section [ statistics.sec ] we apply statistical tools to assess whether the distance moduli based on different tracer populations are statistically consistent with the `` canonical '' distance modulus and the recently published geometric distance based on late - type eb systems ( pietrzyski et al .",
    "we also compare the consistency among a number of different tracers and the entire body of distance measurements ( see sections [ bias.sec ] and [ conclusions.sec ] ) .",
    "the conclusions reached by schaefer ( 2008 ) are , in essence , based on application of a statistical kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov ( ks ) test , assuming a gaussian distribution of lmc distance measurements , to a data set that should not _ a priori _ be expected to be distributed in a gaussian fashion .",
    "astrostatisticians have become more vocal in recent years in their opposition to the use of ks tests in astronomy if not done with due caution ( e.g. , feigelson & babu 2013 ) .",
    "ks tests are only applicable to samples that consist of independent and identically distributed values . in the context of lmc distance measurements ,",
    "both conditions are violated . in this paper",
    "we will show that the close match between subsequent lmc distance determinations is most likely owing to the use of highly non - independent tracer samples , analysis methods , and calibration relations .",
    "4 .   as schaefer ( 2008 )",
    "points out himself , his database of lmc distance measurements is incomplete .",
    "he declares that this does not affect his inferences , but we found that gaps in the data set may , in fact , hide the presence of correlations among subsequent publications ( cf .",
    "section [ bias.sec ] ) . for the analysis presented in this paper ,",
    "we have collected the most complete and comprehensive database of published lmc distance moduli to date , so that our results will not be unduly affected by `` gaps '' in the coverage of our metadata .",
    "these concerns , combined with the significantly longer period ( compared with that accessible by schaefer 2008 ) that has elapsed since freedman et al.s ( 2001 ) seminal paper , prompted us to embark on a detailed ( re-)analysis of the full set of lmc distance determinations , claimed by many of their authors to be based on independent approaches ( but see section [ bias.sec ] ) .",
    "the primary goal of the analysis presented in this paper is to explore the reasons behind the apparent tightening of the biennially ( two - year ) averaged distance moduli and the associated decrease in their standard deviations during specific periods of time .",
    "we aim at exploring whether `` publication bias '' is likely to play a significant role in driving this behavior or whether other effects may be at work .",
    "the longer time span we have access to compared with previous work also allows us to verify whether any clustering of data points persisted beyond the period range of schaefer s ( 2008 ) analysis and whether new clusters of data points may have materialized .",
    "our detailed analysis of the complete body of published lmc distance moduli from 1990 until the end of 2013 , both in full and as a function of distance tracer , is ideally suited to derive statistically robust constraints on the most appropriate mean distance modulus ( projected to the lmc s center ) and its uncertainties for future use ( _ modulo _ the quality of the individual determinations ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ data.sec ] , we present the full compilation of lmc distance moduli published between 1990 and the present time . section [ lmcdist.sec ] addresses general trends in the lmc distance moduli with time , while in section [ bias.sec ] we consider such trends for individual distance tracers and discuss the independence ( or lack thereof ) of the results .",
    "we discuss the statistical basis of our analysis in section [ statistics.sec ] . in section [ conclusions.sec ]",
    "we place these results in a more general context , and we conclude with our recommendations of the most suitable distance modulus for common use , which naturally results from the analysis presented here . in paper",
    "ii ( de grijs et al . 2014 ) we apply a similar analysis to our compilation of the equivalent sets of distance measurements for m31 , m33 , and a number of dwarf galaxies associated with the m31 system ( and slightly beyond ) .",
    "we compiled an extensive database of published distance measurements , following but significantly expanding upon schaefer s ( 2008 ) database .",
    "we used the compilations of gibson ( 2000 ) , benedict et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , clementini et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , steer & madore ( 2007 ) , schaefer ( 2008 ) , and de grijs ( 2011 ; his table 1.1 ) as our basis .",
    "schaefer ( 2008 ) stated specifically that his final compilation was not necessarily complete .",
    "therefore , we carefully checked which of the nearly 16,000 papers published between 1 january 1990 and 31 december 2013 and associated in the nasa / astrophysics data system ( ads ) with the object keyword `` lmc '' presented new distance determinations to the galaxy .",
    "our final compilation contains 233 separate distance determinations published from march 1990 until and inclusive of december 2013 .",
    "in addition to recording the month and year of publication , we compiled the extinction - corrected distance moduli , their statistical uncertainties and  where available  also the systematic errors . only 47 authors published their systematic uncertainties separately , with an additional four papers specifying that their published error bars include the systematic uncertainties . for the remaining 182 lmc distance measurements ,",
    "the uncertainties refer to the statistical errors only . our overall compilation , in order of publication date as well as sorted by stellar population tracer ,",
    "is available from http://astro-expat.info/data/pubbias.html ( all sources that were available at the time of our last update are listed , including those published in early 2014 ; our analysis is restricted to distance moduli published by 31 december 2013 , however ) .",
    "the data tables include full bibliographic information and direct links to the source materials .",
    "the database is predominantly based on distance measurements taken from peer - reviewed articles , although we include a total of 19 distance moduli that were published in conference proceedings .",
    "seven of these latter values were based on cepheids ( from four different publications ) , six on rr lyrae variables ( from three conference papers ) and three on geometric distance determinations ( two using sn 1987a and one based on an early - type eb system ) .",
    "the remaining distance moduli published in conference proceedings were based on observations of m supergiants , mira variable stars , and the planetary nebulae luminosity function ( one determination for each method ) .",
    "we opted to include these values , because individual researchers will likely have checked the recent literature  including conference proceedings  for confirmation of their newly derived values .",
    "in addition , only two conference articles were followed up by publications in the peer - reviewed literature in the period from 1990 until the present time ( popowski & gould 1998 vs 1999 ; dallora et al .",
    "2004a vs 2004b ) .",
    "the distance moduli published in both cases were different between the earlier conference publication and the follow - up peer - reviewed article .",
    "the dallora et al .",
    "( 2004a ) conference paper was presented in may 2003 , followed by a peer - reviewed article more than a year later in july 2004 .",
    "popowski & gould ( 1998 ) used the bono et al .",
    "( 2001 ) calibration , while their 1999 paper was based on the updated bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) calibration relations .",
    "we considered this sufficiently distinct to warrant inclusion of both articles in our database ; the differences between the resulting distance moduli act as a reminder of the systematic uncertainties involved .",
    "rather than combining individual values based on different assumptions or input parameters ( cf .",
    "schaefer 2008 ) , we opted to include all ( final ) lmc distance measurements published in a given paper . schaefer ( 2008 ) argues ( and we agree ) that the range spanned by such alternative values provides a valuable estimate of the systematic uncertainty inherent to the distance determined , and that these values are highly non - independent .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to compare the different values derived from varying one s assumptions based on realistic boundaries .",
    "we will take into account any correlations among results from a given study , as well as correlations between studies based on similar ( or the same ) assumptions , when we discuss trends as a function of year of publication for the different tracers individually in section [ bias.sec ] .",
    "examples of correlated results based on small variations of the underlying assumptions _ in a given study _ include    1 .",
    "variations in the extinction corrections , .",
    "this is why , specifically in the context of variable - star analyses , the focus has gradually shifted from the use of wavelength- and reddening - dependent period  luminosity relations to reddening - free wesenheit relations ( cf .",

    "the combination of multiple values offers one good insights into the systematic uncertainties .",
    "however , we argue that inclusion of the individual values is justified in this context , in particular because many of the distance determinations published in subsequent papers are _ also _ highly non - independent ( see section [ bias.sec ] ) .    despite these differences in the choices made , we concur with schaefer ( 2008 ) regarding the multitude of `` minor dilemmas '' that occur when deciding which values to include in one s master database .",

    ", we realized that they give the uncertainty on the mean of their distribution of distance moduli , assuming a gaussian distribution ( which is not really warranted given the actual distribution of data values ) , instead of the distribution s spread ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "the other three panels provide more details as regards the behavior of specific tracers with time . in all cases , except for the values determined by keller & wood ( 2002 , 2006 ; see section [ data.sec ] ) , the error bars included are those provided in the original papers . where authors distinguish between statistical and systematic uncertainties ,",
    "we only show the statistical uncertainties .",
    "( note that , where available , the statistical uncertainties reported in the individual articles are specifically included in our online database . )",
    "we made this choice for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the uncertainties quoted for the majority of published lmc distance moduli are statistical uncertainties . showing only the statistical uncertainties where we also have the systematic errors thus represents a cleaner comparison among the distance values .",
    "second , where multiple distance moduli were determined in a given paper , the spread among the derived values provides a good handle on the systematic uncertainties .",
    "third , in many cases , the effects of systematic uncertainties are unclear or may have been underestimated ( cf .",
    "schaefer 2008 ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the lmc distance modulus can come in a variety of guises .",
    "they could be related to ( i ) one s zero - point calibration , ( ii ) the functional form of the calibration relations ( see section [ bias.sec ] ) , ( iii ) lutz  kelker - type biases in parallax measurements ( see de grijs 2011 ; his chapter 6.1.2 ) , ( iv ) systematics in the metallicity scale or extinction corrections adopted , or ( v ) transformations between filter systems",
    ". they may also be due to assumptions made to derive the underlying physical behavior or geometry of one s tracer population ( e.g. , as for the sn 1987a ring and the precise locus of its line emission ; cf .",
    "gould & uza 1998 ) .",
    "an important type of systematic uncertainty is immediately apparent from inspection of the top left - hand panel of figure [ lmcdist.fig ] , which takes the form of the well - known `` long  short dichotomy . ''    particularly at early times during the period of interest on which we focus here , authors would derive lmc distance moduli that were either `` short '' or `` long . ''",
    "values straddled@xmath8 mag and @xmath9 mag , respectively , hence leading to a dichotomy in published lmc distance moduli prior to about 2002 ( see the top left - hand panel of figure [ lmcdist.fig ] ) .",
    "this is a typical example of publication bias in astronomy ( for discussions of the long  short dichotomy , see carretta et al .",
    "2000 ; sandage & tammann 2006 ) . in this context , it is puzzling that schaefer ( 2008 ) uses his conclusion that the errors in the lmc distance moduli published in 20022007 ( when the dichotomy had all but disappeared ) deviate from a gaussian distribution as evidence that there must be a problem with the overall _ post-2002 _ data set .",
    "this implicitly assumes that the post-2002 values are independent and distributed in a gaussian fashion ; we will show that both assumptions are not justified once one analyzes the data set in detail .",
    "thus , while the 19972001 distance uncertainties may indeed have been larger than expected from a gaussian distribution , this should not have been a surprise given that the pre-2001 distance values exhibited a clear long  short dichotomy owing to publication bias .",
    "this dichotomy disappeared around 20022004 ( but compare dambis et al .",
    "2013 with the canonical lmc distance modulus for more recent evidence of lingering systematics ) ; yet , schaefer ( 2008 ) interprets the post-2002 behavior as a result of publication bias and he perpetuates this view until the present time ( schaefer 2013 ) .",
    "here we question that latter conclusion . in section [ bias.sec ]",
    ", we will explore the trends for individual distance tracers so as to ascertain the reasons for a number of statistically significant reductions in the quoted error bars .",
    "in figures [ lmcdist2yr.fig][stddev.fig ] we show our metadata in a number of different ways to quantify and explore the trends that may be apparent in the actual distance moduli and their quoted uncertainties .",
    "figure [ lmcdist2yr.fig ] displays two - year averages of the published lmc distance moduli for all tracers , as well as for those tracers for which we have statistically significant numbers of measurements .",
    "in particular , we show the results for the cepheid and rr lyrae variable stars ( 80 and 60 entries , respectively ) , and for distance tracers based on certain features in the color  magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of lmc star clusters , for which we have collected 38 entries . among the latter ,",

    "this implies that a large fraction of the cepheid - based distance measurements in the 20012009 period were based on the same  or on subsets of the same  basic photometric database , so that these samples were not independent .",

    "most classical cepheid - based distance determinations covered here , as well as the derivations based on @xmath11 scuti stars and type ii cepheids , are based on plrs , which are characterized by a slope and a zero - point luminosity .",
    "the zero - point calibrations in almost all publications leading to the 20012009 classical cepheid - based lmc distance moduli are based on distances to well - understood galactic classical cepheids . in turn",
    ", these were obtained on the basis of either _ hipparcos _ , _ hst _ fine guidance sensor ( fgs ) , or interferometric parallax measurements , or baade  wesselink ( bw)-type calibrations .",
    "many of the lmc calibration relations adopt plr slopes that are the same as those in the milky way .",
    "the results based on the calibration relations used in the different articles discussed here are thus highly correlated .",
    "although we can not explicitly rule out a degree of publication bias , we therefore conclude that the tight clustering and small spread observed for cepheid - based lmc distance moduli in the 20012009 period is most likely driven by the public availability of the ogle ii cepheid database , which was published in a convenient form in 1999 . a time lag of 1.52 years between this data release and the first peer - reviewed articles based on it seems reasonable .",
    "this , combined with easy access to the original _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( esa 1997 ; perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) , has led to many authors using the same zero points and ogle ii plr slopes .",
    "this is , hence , the most likely main driver of the tight clustering observed for the cepheid - based lmc distance moduli .",
    "the ogle ii plr slopes are well - defined by virtue of the large numbers of cepheids contributing to the relationships , which has in turn led to a reduction in the associated uncertainties in and spread among the distance moduli .",
    "the bottom left - hand panel of figure [ lmcdist2run.fig ] shows a statistically significant clustering of distance moduli and a pronounced reduction in the associated spread from 1999 onwards .",
    "this follows much greater variation in both measurables during the years prior to this period .",
    "we identified two periods during which the rr lyrae - based lmc distance moduli exhibit statistically significant clustering behavior .",
    "the first period ( p1 ) starts in 1999 and runs through 2002 , immediately followed by a second period ( p2 ) from 2003 until the end of 2006 .",
    "just as for the cepheids , the rr lyrae - based distance tracers are also composed of a mixture of physically different object types .",
    "although the majority of rr lyrae samples considered between 1999 and 2006 are dominated by fu rr lyrae ( rrab ) , fo rr lyrae ( rrc ) and double - mode pulsators ( rrd ) make up sizeable fractions of the most commonly used samples : of the 18 articles with published rr lyrae - based lmc distance moduli in p1+p2 ( see http://astro-expat.info/data/pubbias.html ) , seven are fully or partially based on the rr lyrae sample of clementini et al .",

    "the dallora et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) distance determinations are based on a sample of 21 rrab and nine rrc variables , while the sample of marconi & clementini ( 2005 ) is composed of 7 rrab and 7 rrc stars . in most analyses based on multiple types of rr lyrae pulsators ,",
    "the fo pulsators were `` fundamentalized , '' i.e. , an appropriate correction ( @xmath30 \\approx + 0.127 $ ] ; e.g. , dallora et al .",
    "2004a , b ) was applied to their periods , so that the same period  luminosity  metallicity ( @xmath31 ) relation could be used .    of the remaining publications , alcock et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and clement et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who share team members among their co - authors ( and , hence , most likely used similar methods ; this is unclear given that the latter reference is only an abstract ) , based their results on a set of 330 genuine rrc variables located near the lmc bar , which were selected from the macho ( massive compact halo objects ) database .",
    "finally , kovcs ( 2000 ) used 181 macho rrd stars .",
    "we have indicated the distance moduli resulting from the use of _ only _ rrc and rrd variables in the middle panels of figure [ indivdistlmc.fig ] .",
    "having assessed the rr lyrae sample selection criteria employed in the period between 1999 and 2006 , we conclude that there is substantial overlap among publications , which hence renders their independence questionable .",
    "second , we explored the methods used and which contribute to the average rr lyrae - based lmc distance moduli .",
    "these can be categorized into three main classes , ( i ) those publications that use a form of the @xmath32[fe / h ] luminosity  metallicity relation ( lmr ) , @xmath33_{\\rm rr } + \\beta$ ] ( seven articles ) , ( ii ) those authors that base their distance estimates on a @xmath31 relation ( six articles ) , and ( iii ) those that use theoretical pulsation modeling to derive luminosities and , hence , a distance modulus ( kovcs 2000 ; alcock et al . 2004 ; marconi & clementini 2005 ) .",
    "the zero points of the lmrs and the @xmath31 relations are generally based on parallax measurements to local field or globular cluster ( gc ) rr lyrae in the milky way , either based on _ hipparcos _ or _ hst _ parallaxes .",
    "the general consensus among authors using an lmr is that the slope @xmath34 [ 0.180.20 ] mag dex@xmath35 ( but see below ) , while most authors who relied on @xmath31 relations adopted those of bono et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and their precursors by largely the same authors .",
    "once again , we see that there is significant overlap between the methods used in the publications that eventually result in the average lmc distance moduli reported here .    over the entire range of rr lyrae - based distance determinations examined ,",
    "there has been a gradual shift in the preferred method from lmrs to near - infrared ( nir ) @xmath31 relations .",
    "empirical and theoretical arguments indicate that lmrs might not be linear over the entire metallicity range covered by field rr lyrae stars ( e.g. , bono et al .",
    "2003 ; sandage & tammann 2006 ) .",
    "moreover , they are affected by evolutionary effects such as off - zero - age hb evolution .",
    "this implies that the mass distribution inside the rr lyrae instability strip is poorly known .",
    "note that these considerations apply to both field and cluster rr lyrae .",
    "nir @xmath31 relations are minimally affected by these problems ( e.g. , del principe et al . 2006 ; sollima et al . 2006 ; for a review , see bono et al .",
    "2011 ) .      finally , we considered the spatial distributions of the rr lyrae samples .",
    "twelve ( p1 : 4 ; p2 : 8) of the 18 studies undertaken during the entire period of interest explore the properties of rr lyrae stars in the galaxy s inner regions and/or fields in or near the lmc bar . of the remaining six publications , five ( p1 : bono 2003 ; p2 : dallora et al .",
    "2004a , b ; rastorguev et al . 2005 ; sollima et al . 2006 ) focus on the rr lyrae variables in the lmc gc reticulum .",
    "we note that the latter studies do not necessarily provide a well - constrained distance to the lmc s center .",
    "this is the main reason as to why we opted against inclusion of distance moduli to _ individual _ clusters in our compilation ; reticulum is an exception , because of its benchmark use by a number of authors .",
    "only two articles venture beyond the inner galaxy or reticulum : groenewegen & salaris ( 1999 ) and mcnamara ( 2001 ) both based their lmc distance estimate on a study of rr lyrae stars in ( the same ) seven old lmc gcs . in the middle panels of figure [ indivdistlmc.fig ] , we have separately indicated the lmc distance moduli based on studies of the reticulum gc , as well as the gc results of groenewegen & salaris ( 1999 ) and mcnamara ( 2001 ) .",
    "the reticulum - based distance determinations do not appear to be systematically offset from the field rr lyrae distance estimates .",
    "this analysis strengthens us in our conclusion that the basic samples used for rr lyrae - based distance determinations between 1999 and 2006 were highly interdependent .",
    "correlations among the resulting distance values may thus be expected and should certainly not come as a surprise .",
    "we also explored the possible reason(s ) for the origin of the rather sudden reduction in average distance modulus between p1 and p2 .",
    "a close examination of the middle right - hand panel of figure [ indivdistlmc.fig ] reveals that most distance determinations cluster very tightly around or just below the level of the canonical distance modulus , with the exception of rastorguev et al.s ( 2005 ) distance estimate to reticulum .",
    "rastorguev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) examined 388 galactic field rr lyrae stars selected from the beers et al .",
    "( 2000 ) catalog , as well as 1204 rrab and rc variables with proper - motion data located within 6 kpc from the sun .",
    "they employed the now - outdated nir plr of jones et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , which was calibrated based on application of the bw method , as well as statistical parallaxes to determine the plr s zero point .",
    "based on the observations of reticulum rr lyrae stars from dallora et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) , the plr of carney et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , and their new zero point , they obtained a new lmc distance modulus , which is significantly shorter than the canonical value .",
    "however , this data point does not appreciably affect the average level during p2 , however .",
    "the scatter among the data points in the middle left - hand panel is greater , and so are the error bars ( spreads ) associated with a number of the distance moduli .",
    "the data points driving an offset of the mean distance moduli to a level above the canonical value are based on mcnamara s ( 2001 ) distance determinations .",
    "first , we point out that  perhaps surprisingly  the gc distance moduli of groenewegen & salaris ( 1999 ) , @xmath36 mag , and mcnamara ( 2001 ) , @xmath37 mag , are identical . both teams used lmrs , although with very different slopes : @xmath38 vs 0.30 mag dex@xmath35 ( groenewegen & salaris 1999 vs mcnamara 2001 ) . for the same zero point",
    ", this difference in slope leads to a luminosity difference of 0.18 mag for the typical metallicity of lmc rr lyrae stars usually adopted , [ fe / h ] @xmath39 dex , in the sense that the lmr with the steeper slope would lead to a brighter magnitude .",
    "the former authors used the technique of `` reduced parallax '' and found that  for the same slope and exactly the same sample of rr lyrae variables  they obtained a zero point , @xmath40 mag , which is @xmath41 mag brighter than the zero point obtained from statistical - parallax calibration .",
    "mcnamara ( 2001 ) , on the other hand , calibrated the lmr on the basis of the plr of galactic high - amplitude @xmath11 scuti stars and found @xmath42 mag , a difference of @xmath43 mag , which largely negates the effect of the difference in @xmath4 between both studies .",
    "it thus appears that both analyses , although based on the same set of seven lmc gcs , use independent methods to yield the same distance to the lmc . in other words ,",
    "the systematically larger lmc distance derived from the rr lyrae stars in these seven gcs may represent real distance variance , or instead imply that the centroid of the gcs distribution is not co - located with the center of the lmc as defined by its bar .",
    "even a cursory glance at the bottom right - hand panel of figure [ lmcdist2run.fig ] immediately shows that the lmc distance moduli based on cmd - feature calibration converge significantly from 2006 onwards",
    ". a closer look at the publications leading to the average values shown in this figure reveals that there is a simple reason for this statistically significant clustering . for the period up to 2004/2005",
    ", various authors used a range of cmd features to derive their distance moduli , including the hb level , the trgb , the magnitude of the helium - burning rc , as well as ms / msto fitting .",
    "however , with the exception of rubele et al.s ( 2012 ) distance determination , since 2006 the rc magnitude has been the only diagnostic cmd feature used to estimate the distance to the lmc .    of the six rc - based distance determinations between 2006 and 2013 ( see our online database ) ,",
    "most used nir photometry of predominantly central fields in the lmc . at nir wavelengths , population effects  such as those caused by differences in ages and metallicities ",
    "are minimal , although not necessarily negligible .",
    "[ rubele et al . (",
    "2012 ) also used nir observations , which were newly obtained with the eso/_vista _ telescope as part of the eso public survey of the magellanic system . ] in addition , most authors used the same set of population corrections , i.e. , those proposed by girardi & salaris ( 2001 ) and salaris & girardi ( 2002 ) , or fully equivalent methods . given that the apparent magnitudes of rc stars across the lmc can be easily deprojected to the lmc center , it is not surprising that all recent cmd - based distance determinations yield very similar values .",
    "it is not necessary to attribute this effect to publication bias .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,>,>,^,^,>,^,^ , > , > , > \" , ]     in view of our analysis and discussion of the statistically significant clustering of lmc distance moduli and the observed reduction in their spread over the past two decades , we conclude that strong publication bias is unlikely to have affected the majority of published lmc distance moduli .",
    "note that our conclusions pertain to the largest , most complete data set of lmc distance moduli available to date , superseding all previous compilations . to get a handle on the systematic spread in distance determinations owing to , e.g. ,",
    "depth effects and real cosmic variance , we determined the average distance moduli and the associated population standard deviations for all published distance determinations , as well as for those based on cepheid and rr lyrae variables and on cmd features , for two recent periods , i.e. since 2001 and since 2005 until the present time .",
    "the results are shown in table [ stats.tab ] .",
    "the final section of table [ stats.tab ] lists the weighted means and standard deviations based on a careful combination , in a statistical sense ( i.e. , following watkins et al .",
    "2013 , their appendix a ) , of the mean distance moduli and their uncertainties for the cepheid and rr lyrae variables , the cmd features , and the latest ebs result of pietrzyski et al .",
    "our main underlying assumption adopted here was that the individual data points are distributed normally ( i.e. , approximately in a gaussian fashion ) ; this is a good first - order approximation to all data sets pertaining to the three specific tracers included in the table .    for a more in - depth statistical analysis",
    ", we refer the reader to section [ statistics.sec ] . in view of these results , as well as those listed in table [ cepheids.tab ] , we recommend that a slightly updated canonical distance modulus of @xmath1 mag be used for all practical purposes that require a general distance scale without the need for accuracies better than a few percent . in paper ii in this series ,",
    "we extend our analysis to the body of distance measurements for m31 , m33 , and a number of their companion galaxies , and place our recommendations in the context of distance measures to local group galaxies and beyond .",

    "<S> the distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) represents a key local rung of the extragalactic distance ladder . yet , </S>",
    "<S> the galaxy s distance modulus has long been an issue of contention , in particular in view of claims that most newly determined distance moduli cluster tightly  and with a small spread  around the `` canonical '' distance modulus , @xmath0 mag . </S>",
    "<S> we compiled 233 separate lmc distance determinations published between 1990 and 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the individual distance moduli , as well as of their two - year means and standard deviations resulting from this largest data set of lmc distance moduli available to date , focuses specifically on cepheid and rr lyrae variable - star tracer populations , as well as on distance estimates based on features in the observational hertzsprung  </S>",
    "<S> russell diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that strong publication bias is unlikely to have been the main driver of the majority of published lmc distance moduli . </S>",
    "<S> however , for a given distance tracer , the body of publications leading to the tightly clustered distances is based on highly non - independent tracer samples and analysis methods , hence leading to significant correlations among the lmc distances reported in subsequent articles . </S>",
    "<S> based on a careful , weighted combination , in a statistical sense , of the main stellar population tracers , we recommend that a slightly adjusted canonical distance modulus of @xmath1 mag be used for all practical purposes that require a general distance scale without the need for accuracies of better than a few percent . </S>"
