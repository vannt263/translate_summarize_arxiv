    "recent cosmological observations namely , high redshift surveys of type ia supernovae , wmap , cmb etc .",
    "predict that the present universe is passing through an accelerating phase of expansion [ 1 ] .",
    "it has also been predicted from cobe that the present universe might have emerged from an inflationary phase in the early universe .",
    "the above two observational facts in the universe do not find explanation in the framework of einstein general theory of relativity ( gtr ) with normal matter .",
    "it is known that early inflation may be realized in a semiclassical theory of gravity where matter is described by quantum fields [ 2 ] .",
    "starobinsky obtained inflationary solution considering a curvature squared term in the einstein - hilbert action [ 3 ] long before the advent of inflation was known .",
    "however , the efficacy of inflation is known only after the seminal work of guth who first employed the phase transition mechanism to accommodate inflation .",
    "thereafter more than a dozen of inflationary model came up . in some of these inflation",
    "is realized by ( i ) a modification of gravitational sector of action introducung higher order terms or [ 4 ] , ( ii ) a modification of the matter sector taking into account scalar fields . in the later case inflation",
    "is obtained with an equation of state @xmath0 , if @xmath1 , but the present accelerating phase can be realized with @xmath2 .",
    "the usual fields in the standard model of particle physics are not suitable to obtain such accelerating phase of the universe .",
    "in fact it is a challenge to theoretical physics to describe the origin of such matter density .",
    "recent astronomical observations predict that dark energy content of the universe is about 76 % of the total energy density of the universe . to accommodate such a huge energy density various kinds of exotic matters",
    "are considered as possible candidate for the dark energy .",
    "chaplygin gas is one such candidate with an equation of state ( eos ) @xmath3 [ 5 ] , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy density and pressure respectively and @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "subsequently , a modified form of the equation of state @xmath7 with @xmath8 was also considered to construct a viable cosmological model [ 6 , 7 ] , which is known as generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) .",
    "it has two free parameters @xmath6 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "the eos for gcg has been further modified to @xmath10 , with @xmath8 which is known as modified gcg [ 8 , 9 ] . in a flat friedmann model",
    "it is shown [ 6 ] that the modified generalized chaplygin gas may be equivalently described in terms of a homogeneous minimally coupled scalar field @xmath11 .",
    "barrow [ 10 ] has outlined a method to fit chaplygin gas in frw universe .",
    "[ 11 ] using the above scheme obtained the corresponding homogeneous scalar field @xmath12 in a potential @xmath13 which can be used to obtain a viable cosmological model with modified chaplygin gas .",
    "another form of eos for chaplygin gas [ 12 ] is considered recently which is given by @xmath14 with a variable @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a constant and @xmath17 is the scale factor of the universe .",
    "guo and zhang [ 13 ] obtained cosmological model using the eos for variable chaplygin gas .",
    "cosmological observational results are used to study the constraints [ 14 ] + recently holographic principle [ 15 , 16 ] is incorporated in cosmology [ 17 - 20 ] to track the dark energy content of the universe following the work of cohen _ et al . _ [ 21 ] .",
    "holographic principle is a speculative conjecture about quantum gravity theories proposed by gt hooft .",
    "the idea is subsequently promoted by fischler and susskind [ 15 ] claiming that all the information contained in a spatial volume may be represented by a theory that lives on the boundary of that space . for a given finite region of space",
    "it may contain matter and energy within it .",
    "if this energy be less than a critical value then the region collapses to a black hole . as a black hole",
    "is known theoretically to have an entropy which is proportional to its surface area of its event horizon .",
    "a black hole event horizon encloses a volume , thus a more massive black hole have larger event horizon and encloses larger volume .",
    "the most massive black hole that can fit in a given region is the one whose event horizon corresponds exactly to the boundary of the given region under consideration .",
    "the maximal limit of entropy for an ordinary region of space is directly proportional to the surface area of the region and not to its volume .",
    "thus , according to holographic principle , under suitable conditions all the information about a physical system inside a spatial region is encoded in the boundary .",
    "the basic idea of a holographic dark energy in cosmology is that the saturation of the entropy bound may be related to an unknown ultra - violet ( uv ) scale @xmath18 to some known comological scale in order to enable it to find a viable formula for the dark energy which may be quantum gravity in origin and it is characterized by @xmath18 .",
    "the choice of uv - infra red ( ir ) connection from the covariant entropy bound leads to a universe dominated by blackhole states . according to cohen _",
    "[ 21 ] for any state in the hilbert space with energy @xmath19 , the corresponding schwarzschild radius @xmath20 , may be less than the ir cut off value @xmath21 ( where @xmath21 is a cosmological scale ) .",
    "it is possible to derive a relation between the uv cutoff @xmath22 and the ir cutoff which eventually leads to a constraint @xmath23 [ 22 ] where @xmath24 is the energy density corresponding to dark energy characterized by @xmath25 , @xmath26 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath27 is a parameter in the theory .",
    "the holographic dark energy density is @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "it is known that the present acceleration may be described if @xmath30 .",
    "if one considers @xmath31 it gives @xmath32 .",
    "a holographic cosmological constant model based on hubble scale as ir cut off does not permit accelerating universe .",
    "it is also examined [ 17 ] that the holographic dark energy model based on the particle horizon as the ir cutoff is not suitable for an accelerating universe .",
    "however , an alternative model of dark energy using particle horizon in closed model is also proposed [ 23 ] .",
    "li [ 18 ] has obtained an accelerating universe considering event horizon as the cosmological scale .",
    "the model is consistent with the cosmological observations .",
    "thus to have a model consistent with observed universe one should adopt the covariant entropy bound and choose @xmath21 to be event horizon [ 24 ] . considering a correspondence of holographic dark energy and chaplygin gas the field potential",
    "is reconstructed [ 25 , 26 ] . in this paper",
    "we consider eos given by ( 1 ) and set up a correspondence with holographic dark energy to reconstruct scalar field potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 , the relevant field equation with modified variable chaplygin gas in frw universe is presented .",
    "considering correspondence of holographic dark energy fields with modified variable chaplygin gas , we determine the field and the corresponding potential is reconstructed . in sec .",
    "3 , squared speed of sound for holographic dark energy is evaluated for stability analysis . finally in sec .",
    "4 , a brief discussion is given .",

    "the energy momentum tensor is @xmath37 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are energy density and pressure respectively .    using rw metric ( 4 ) and the energy momentum tensor , the einstein s field equation ( 3 ) yields @xmath38 where we use @xmath39 .",

    "the energy conservation equation is @xmath78 which is used to determine the equation of state parameter @xmath79 now we assume holographic dark energy density which is equivalent to the modified variable chaplygin gas energy density .",

    "[ 27 ] and for @xmath57 and @xmath86 , it reduces to that form obtained by setare [ 25 ] ( where @xmath16 is to be replaced by @xmath87 ) .",
    "we now substitute @xmath88 @xmath89 , to transform the time derivative to the derivative with logarithm of the scale factor , which is the most useful function in this case .",
    "consequently from eq .",
    "( 27 ) one obtains @xmath90 where @xmath91 prime represents derivative with respect to @xmath88 .",

    "we give here a generalized expression for the potential and the kinetic energy term considering a modified variable chaplygin gas [ 12 , 13 ] . the holographic dark energy field and the corresponding potential depend on three parameters namely , @xmath87 , @xmath9 and @xmath113 .",
