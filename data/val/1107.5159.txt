    "in the famous gedanken experiment conceived by galileo , the universality of the ratio between the gravitational and inertial masses has been studied with test bodies in free fall from the leaning tower of pisa @xcite . since then",
    "several tests of weak equivalence principle have been performed with classical test bodies such as very sensitive pendula or torsion balances establishing extremely accurate conformation of the equality of gravitational and inertial masses .",
    "the most familiar tests of the weak equivalence principle are experiments of the etvs - type @xcite , which measure the gravitational acceleration of macroscopic objects.thus einstein s weak equivalence principle is established in the newtonian picture of the gravitational force which is exactly proportional to the inertial mass .",
    "the validity of the principle even for quantum mechanical particles is also proved using gravity - induced interference experiments @xcite .",
    "+ the traditional equivalence principle is fundamentally both classical and local , and it is interesting to enquire how it is to be understood in quantum mechanics .",
    "principle of equivalence states that inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass ; @xmath0 .",
    "another statement is that when all sufficiently small test bodies fall freely , they acquire an equal acceleration independent of their mass or constituent in a gravitational field .",
    "quantum mechanically , it @xcite can be said that `` the results of experiments in an external potential comprising just a sufficiently weak , homogeneous gravitational field , as determined by the wave function , are independent of the mass of the system '' . the last statement is also known as weak equivalence principle of quantum mechanics ( weq ) .",
    "+ the possibility of violation of weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics is discussed in a number of papers , for instance using neutrino mass oscillations in a gravitational potential @xcite .",
    "the evidence of violation of weq can be shown both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "experimental evidence exists in the interference phenomenon associated with the gravitational potential in neutron and atomic interferometry experiments @xcite .",
    "theoretically , for a particle bound in an external gravitational potential , it is seen that the radii , frequencies and binding energy depend on the mass of the bound particle @xcite .",
    "+ the free fall of test particles in a uniform gravitational field in the case of quantum states with and without a classical analogue was re - examined by viola and onofrio@xcite .",
    "another quantum mechanical approach of the violation of weq was given by davies @xcite for a quantum particle in a uniform gravitational field using a model quantum clock @xcite .",
    "a quantum particle moving in a gravitational field can penetrate the classically forbidden region beyond the classical turning point of the gravitational potential and the tunnelling depth depends on the mass of the particle .",
    "so , there is a small mass - dependent quantum delay in the return time representing a violation of weak equivalence principle .",
    "this violation is found within a distance of roughly one de broglie wavelength from the turning point of the classical trajectory .",
    "+ in the recent past , ali et al .",
    "@xcite have shown an explicit mass dependence of the position probabilities for quantum particles projected upwards against gravity around both the classical turning point and the point of initial projection using gaussian wave packet .",
    "they also have shown an explicit mass dependence of the mean arrival time at an arbitrary detector location for a gaussian wave packet under free fall .",
    "thus both the position probabilities and the mean arrival time show the violation of weq for quantum particles represented by gaussian wave packets . in the present paper , using a class of non - gaussian wave packets involving a tunable parameter , we shall compute position detection probabilities around the classical turning point and the point of initial projection and also compute the mean arrival time for atomic and molecular mass particles represented by non - gaussian wave packets to observe stronger violation of weq for quantum particles . to compute the mean arrival time , we consider the case when the particles are dropped from a height with zero initial velocity .",
    "+ violation of weq arises as a consequence of the spread of wave packets the magnitude of which itself depends on the mass . in order to illustrate this effect we present an analysis in terms of bohmian trajectories . in the bohmian model @xcite each individual particle",
    "is assumed to have a definite position , irrespective of any measurement .",
    "the pre - measured value of position is revealed when an actual measurement is done . over an ensemble of particles having the same wave function @xmath1 ,",
    "these ontological positions are distributed according to the probability density @xmath2 where the wave function @xmath1 evolves with time according to the schrdinger equation and the equation of motion of any individual particle is determined by the guidance equation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the bohmian velocity of the particle and @xmath5 is the probability current density .",
    "solving the guidance equation one gets the trajectory of the particle . in the present work",
    "we describe the evolution of bohmian trajectories in terms of the mass and the tunable parameter of the non - gaussian wave packet .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of quantum particles projected upwards against gravity with a given initial mean position and mean velocity .",
    "our motivation is to look for greater violation of the equivalence principle compared to that achieved by a gaussian wave packet .",

    "the salient features corresponding to the above wave packet are its asymmetry , its infinite tail , and its reduciblity to a gaussian wave packet upon a continuous decrement of the parameter @xmath12 to zero .",
    "the property of an infinite tail of the above wave function is not associated with non - gaussian forms that are generated by truncating the gaussian distribution .",

    "note that with the increase of the parameter @xmath12 , one needs to go to higher values of mass in order for the mass - dependence to become insignificant .",
    "thus , a non - gaussian wave packet can exhibit non - classical features in a mass range where its gaussian counterpart behaves classically .",
    "within the bohmian interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite each individual particle is assumed to have a definite position , irrespective of any measurement .",
    "the equation of motion of the particle is , @xmath100 where @xmath101 is called quantum potential energy and it is explicitly mass - dependent and @xmath102 determines the path of the particle . in the gravitational potential @xmath103 the quantum version of newton s second law is given by @xmath104 to quote from holland @xcite , `` it is immediately clear that the assumption of the equality of the inertial and passive gravitational masses does not imply that all bodies fall with an equal acceleration in a given gravitational field , due to the intervention of the mass - dependent quantum force term . ''",
    "thus , weq is violated .",
    "the arrival - time problem is unambiguously solved in the bohmian mechanics , where for an arbitrary scattering potential @xmath105 , one finds @xcite that for those particles that actually reach @xmath106 , the arrival - time distribution is given by the modulus of the probability current density , i.e. , @xmath107 .",
    "the quantum potential @xmath108 is nonlocal , and thus it is expected that its effect on the violation of weq is manifested in a way similar to the violation observed as a consequence of the spread of the wave packet .",
    "we compute a set of bohmian trajectories corresponding to free fall of our non - gaussian wave packet with the tunable parameter @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig : freefall - traj ] shows a selection of bohmian trajectories exhibiting their spread depending upon the values of @xmath46 and @xmath12 . note that for small mass , the trajectories with initial positions on the left and right of the center of the wave packet ( mean @xmath45 ) spread out with evolution , indicating violation of weq .",
    "the magnitude of spread increases with @xmath12 , signifying stronger violation of weq with increased departure from gaussianity .",
    "the spread of the trajectories decreases as mass is increased , leading to the emergence of weq in the classical limit .",
    "to summarize , in this work we have studied the violation of the gravitational weak equivalence principle in quantum mechanics using a non - gaussian wave packet .",
    "the wave packet is constructed in such a way , that its departure from gaussianity is represented by a continuous and tunable parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the asymmetry of the wave packet entails a difference between its mean and peak , and causes the peak to evolve differently from a classical point particle , whereas the mean evolves like a classical point particle modulo a constant depending upon the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "such a result is consistent with the ehrenfest therorem , as we have shown , and re - confirmed using the wigner distribution .",
    "the correspondence with the results following from a gaussian wave packet is achieved in the limit of @xmath109 .",
    "the weak equivalence principle is shown to be violated first through the dependence on mass of the position detection probabilities of freely falling particles . the magnitude of violation increases with the increase of the non - gaussian parameter @xmath12 , signifying stronger viotation of weq with larger deviation from gaussianity .",
    "we next compute the arrival time of freely falling wave packets through the probability current distribution corresponding to the non - gaussian wave packet .",
    "the violation of weq is again exhibited with the dependence on mass of the mean arrival time .",
    "it is observed that in the limit of large mass the classical value for the mean arrival time is approached , thereby indicating the emergence of the weq in the classical limit . in this context",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that though our work follows as a natural consequence of quantum mechanics or quantum theory in the non - relativistic limit , it does not imply a violation of general covariance in the relativistic domain .",
    "an interesting connection between the non - relativistic limit of quantum theory and the principle of equivalence has recently been discussed @xcite .",
    "finally , a computation of bohmian trajectories further establishes the stronger violation of weq by a non - gaussian wave packet .",
    "we conclude by noting that realization of exactly gaussian wave packets is rather difficult in real experiments .",
    "one of the consequences of our results is to enable relaxation of the wave packet to be gaussian , and therefore it can facilitate the experimental observation of the violation of weq , as well as enable a quantitative verification of the way the violation of weq depends on the departure from the gaussian nature of the wave packet .",
