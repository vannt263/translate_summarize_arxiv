    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) .",
    "however , the understanding of their progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms remains substantially incomplete .",
    "it is thought that sne  ia are the product of the thermonuclear explosions of c / o white dwarfs ( hoyle & fowler 1960 ; colgate & mckee 1969 ; see hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 for a review ) , but very early discovery and detailed follow - up observations are essential for learning about the nature of the progenitor evolution and the nature of the explosion process .",
    "recent examples of well - studied sne  ia include sn  2009ig ( foley et al .",
    "2012 ) , sn  2011fe ( nugent et al . 2011 ; li et al . 2011 ) , and sn  2012cg ( silverman et al .",
    "2012a ) ; like sn  2013dy , they were discovered shortly after exploding .",
    "early discovery and identification give us the opportunity to obtain spectra when the sne are still very young , yielding more insight into the composition of the sn blastwave ( especially the outer layers ) and its progenitor star .",
    "for example , while o is often seen ( can be from both unburned material and a product of c burning ) , spectroscopic c is much more rare . in particular ,",
    "strong c features have been seen only in a few `` super - chandrasekhar mass '' sne  ia : snls-03d3bb ( sn  2003fg ; howell et al .",

    "the field of ngc  7250 has been observed by the 0.76 m katzman automatic imaging telescope ( kait ) more than 600 times over the past 15yr as part of the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ; filippenko et al .",
    "2001 ) . in early 2011",
    ", the loss search strategy was modified to monitor fewer galaxies at a more rapid cadence with the objective of promptly identifying very young sne ( hours to days after explosion ) .",
    "the new software autonomously prompts kait to obtain a sequence of @xmath9 , @xmath4 , @xmath10 , and unfiltered ( roughly @xmath11 ) images when a new transient is discovered , usually only minutes after the discovery images were taken .",
    "one of the first successful discoveries using this technique was sn  2012cg ( silverman et al .",
    "2012a ) , followed by several others ( e.g. , sn  2013ab , blanchard et al .",
    "2013 ; sn  2013dh , kumar et al .",
    "although multi - band follow - up photometry was not autonomously triggered for sn  2013dy on the night of discovery , it was triggered two days later .",
    "the trigger was not activated the first night because the sn was quite faint and multiple other ( spurious ) candidates were found in the discovery image .",
    "however , the autonomous trigger activated by the second kait image demonstrates that the software triggering capability functions well .",
    "sn  2013dy was discovered ( casper et al . 2013 ) in an 18  s unfiltered kait image taken at 10:55:30 on 2013  july  10 ( ut dates are used throughout ) at @xmath12mag .",
    "we measure its j2000.0 coordinates to be @xmath13 , @xmath14 , with an uncertainty of @xmath15 in each coordinate .",
    "figure [ fc_sdss ] shows kait and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) finding chart near the sn location .",
    "sn  2013dy is @xmath16 west and @xmath17 north of the nucleus of the host galaxy ngc  7250 , at a distance of @xmath18mpc ( calculated from the tully - fisher relation ; tully et al .",
    "2009 ) , which gives the sn a projected distance of @xmath6  1.76kpc from the nucleus .",
    "we note that there is a bright , blue region about @xmath19 west and @xmath20 south of the sn ( projected distance @xmath21kpc ) , which may be a star - forming region or merger ( leda  214816 ; paturel et al .",
    "it has been recently reported that the observed differences among sne  ia may be tied to their birthplace environments ( e.g. , kelly et al . 2010 ; wang et al .",

    "point - spread function photometry was then obtained using daophot ( stetson 1987 ) from the idl astronomy user s library .",
    "the sn instrumental magnitudes are calibrated to local sdss standards transformed into the landolt system .",
    "we applied an image - subtraction procedure to remove host - galaxy light from only the unfiltered images , because multi - band images without the sn are not yet available .",
    "however , kait has a relatively small pixel scale ( @xmath24 pixel@xmath25 ) , and the host background is quite uniform and faint in the kait images , so we believe that the contribution from the host galaxy is minor in all bands , especially considering the brightness of the sn . comparisons of the subtracted and not subtracted unfiltered images yield nearly identical results ( differences of @xmath26mag or less ) .",
    "interestingly , an unfiltered prediscovery detection of sn  2013dy was obtained at 02:04:11 july 10 ( casper et al .",
    "2013 ) with the 0.5 m reflector at monte agliale observatory as part of the italian supernova search project ( issp ) .",
    "additional confirmation images were taken on july 11 and 26 .",
    "we have reprocessed the original images as part of this study .",
    "owing to the relatively large pixel scale ( @xmath27 pixel@xmath25 ) , the sn is blended with host - galaxy light . using a template image taken on 2011 august 4",
    ", we performed the same subtraction method as for the kait unfiltered images .",
    "we then obtained photometry with an aperture of radius 1.5pixels , a reasonable size given the seeing and large pixel scale .",

    "figure [ fig_lcfit ] shows our _ bvri _ and unfiltered light curves of sn  2013dy . applying a low - order polynomial fit",
    ", we find that sn  2013dy reached a @xmath4-band peak magnitude of @xmath28 on 2013 july @xmath29 , @xmath6  17.7d after first light .",
    "assuming @xmath30mag ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) , @xmath31mag ( see below ) , and @xmath32mpc ( tully et al . 2009 ) , this implies @xmath5 ( statistical only ) mag , which is @xmath6  0.5mag dimmer than the typical sn  ia , but still within the range of a `` normal '' sn  ia .",
    "the unfiltered band reached a peak of @xmath33mag , which means our first detection of the sn from the issp image ( 18.71mag , with a limiting magnitude of @xmath34 ) was taken when the sn was at only @xmath35% of its peak brightness .",
    "fit for combined kait and issp unfiltered fluxes before july 14 ( with an inferred first - light time of @xmath36d ) , while the dashed black line is the @xmath37 fit only for kait data before july 18 ( with an inferred first - light time of @xmath38d ) .",
    "the residuals are shown in the bottom panel with the same color .",

    "bottom : map of the @xmath39 hypersurface around the minimum - fit result of @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the outbound for each color of black , red , and blue corresponds to 68% , 90% , and 95% confidence intervals ( from inside to outside ) , respectively .",
    "[ figure_lc_brokenpl ] ]    in order to determine the time of first light , one can assume that the sn luminosity scales as the surface area of the expanding fireball , and therefore increases quadratically with time ( @xmath42 , commonly known as the @xmath43 model ; arnett 1982 ; riess et al .",
    "1999 ; nugent et al .",
    "we restrict our model fit to the unfiltered data , which have the best phase coverage .",
    "although issp images are also unfiltered , there might be possible differences between the kait and issp effective bandpasses .",
    "fortunately , the second and third issp observations are between kait observations , and the issp magnitudes are consistent with the kait light curve , suggesting that the issp unfiltered band is very close to that of kait .",
    "moreover , we measured isolated reference stars in the issp images and compared their magnitudes with the same stars in the kait images , finding consistent results between the two telescopes with differences @xmath44mag .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to combine the issp and kait unfiltered results .",
    "regardless , we first apply the fit only to kait fluxes in the first few days ( before july 18 ) .",
    "we find that a @xmath43 model can not fit the data very well .",
    "we therefore free the exponent of the power law and obtain a best - fit value of @xmath45 , with a corresponding first - light time of @xmath46d ( relative to the first detection time , july  10.086 ) .",
    "the exponent is about 3@xmath47 away from the @xmath43 model ( marginally consistent ) .",
    "however , as can be seen from the residual plot in figure [ fig_lcfit ] , the first night of kait data is below the fit , indicating an even faster light curve .",
    "this becomes more drastic if we include the first issp detection , which is far below the extrapolation of the @xmath37 fit .",
    "thus , we refit the fluxes including both issp and kait data , but restricted to data taken before july 14 .",
    "we find the best - fit power law exponent for these early data to be @xmath48 , with a corresponding first - light time of @xmath49d .",
    "note that the nondetection from kait on july 8.47 ( limiting magnitude @xmath50 ) is consistent with both the @xmath51 fit and the @xmath37 fit .",
    "the apparent change of the power law indices indicates a varying power law of the early rising light curve .",
    "hence , we adopt a broken power law function , also widely used for fitting grb afterglows ( e.g. , zheng et al .",
    "2012 ) : @xmath52}^{-1/s},\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the flux , @xmath40 is the first - light time , @xmath54 is the break time , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the two power law indices before and after the break , and @xmath57 is a smoothing parameter .",
    "the final fit result gives @xmath58d , namely july 9.99 , and @xmath59d , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , as shown in figure [ figure_lc_brokenpl ] .    with an estimated first - light time of @xmath63d ( 2.4hr ) , this is the earliest detection of any sne  ia , even earlier than for sn  2011fe ( detected only 11.0hr after first light ; nugent et al .",
    "2011 ) and sn 2009ig ( detected 17hr after first light ; foley et al . 2012 ) .",
    "it also makes sn  2013dy a rare case with more than one detection within the initial day after first light : there are 3 epochs of detection within 1d and 5 epochs within 1.5d .",
    "our best - fit broken power law model of the early light curve yields the following conclusions .",
    "( 1 ) the @xmath43 model is not sufficient for every sn  ia ; some sne may have different power law exponents describing their rise ( see also piro & nakar 2012 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the rising exponent may vary with time .",
    "perhaps the usual @xmath43 model works well for previous sne  ia because those examples did not have more than one observation to constrain the power law exponent within the first day .",
    "the varying exponent indicates that the very early fireball may exhibit significant changes in either the photospheric temperature , the velocity , or the fireball input energy during expansion .",
    "these changes may happen on a time scale of 24d after first light .",
    "the very early light curve before the break time may be the contribution from the shock - heated cooling emission after shock breakout , which has a predicted rising index of 1.5 ( @xmath64 ; see eq . 3 in piro & nakar 2013 ) . however , our observed power law index is 0.88 , smaller than predicted .",
    "the rising index also depends on underlying physical parameters ; detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere .",
    "alternatively , the early - time observations constrain the emission from the ejecta , which can be used to limit the radius of the progenitor star as well as interaction with the circumstellar medium or a companion star ( kasen 2010 ) . for sn  2013dy , the early issp unfiltered observation of @xmath65 mag ( corrected for extinction ) at 0.10d limits any emission from this process to be @xmath66ergs@xmath25 at optical wavelengths . comparing these parameters with those of sn  2011fe , which has a constraint on its progenitor star @xmath67 ( see fig . 4 of nugent et al .",
    "2011 ) , our constraint for sn  2013dy is slightly weaker ( factor of @xmath68 ) , and so we infer the radius of the progenitor star to be @xmath69 . even if we conservatively assume the first - light time to be earlier , the same time as the kait upper limit ( july 8.47 ) , we can still find that @xmath70 , consistent with a white dwarf progenitor .",
    "figure  [ fig_spec_all ] shows our spectra of sn  2013dy from the first @xmath6  2weeks .",
    "most exhibit narrow  d absorption from both the host galaxy and the milky way .",
    "the median redshift determined from these features is @xmath71 , consistent with the redshift given in simbad ( 0.00389 ) .",
    "  in some of the spectra are produced by ccd fringing . ]",
    "the equivalent width ( ew ) of  d absorption is often converted into reddening , but with large scatter over the empirical relationship ( poznanski et al .",
    "the median ew of  d from the host galaxy is measured to be @xmath6  0.53 , which yields a range of possible reddening values around @xmath31mag ( poznanski et al .",
    "2011 ) . for milky way extinction ,",
    "the measured median ew of  d is @xmath6  0.50 , corresponding to @xmath72mag , consistent with the value of @xmath30mag given by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ; here we adopt the latter .      to help identify the species present in our spectra of sn  2013dy",
    ", we used the spectrum - synthesis code synapps ( thomas et al .",
    ". a few examples of our fits are shown in figure  [ fig_spec_all ] .",
    "our first spectrum of sn  2013dy ( 1.63d after first light ) consists of absorption features from ions usually seen in sne  ia ( , , , , and , as well as strong ) .",
    "all of these species have expansion velocities @xmath7315,000 km  s@xmath25 , similar to what was found in the earliest spectra of sn  2011fe ( parrent et al . 2012 ) .",

    "in addition to the usual photospheric absorption component of the near - infrared triplet , sn  2013dy exhibits a high - velocity feature ( hvf ) in our early spectra having a velocity of @xmath7426,000 km  s@xmath25 .",
    "similar absorption is also seen in a few other well - observed sne , including sn  2005cf ( wang et al . 2009 ) and sn  2012fr ( e.g. , maund et al .",
    "2013 ; childress et al .",
    "this hvf appears to be detached from the rest of the photosphere , slowing down to @xmath7423,000 km  s@xmath25after three days ( measured from the first spectrum ) and maintaining that velocity through at least 11d . as for @xmath86355 ,",
    "the velocity continuously slow down from @xmath7418,500 km  s@xmath25at 1.63d to @xmath7411,400 km  s@xmath25 at 11.27d .",
    "interestingly , our first spectrum exhibits a strong line @xmath75  redward of the usual prominent @xmath86355 .",
    "it is very likely to be the @xmath86580 line ; a weaker @xmath87234 feature is also visible .",
    "such strong lines are not usually seen in normal sne  ia ( silverman et al .",
    "2012b ) , but similar features have been observed in a few super - chandrasekhar mass examples .",
    "though is distinguishably detected in over 1/4 of all normal sne  ia ( e.g. , parrent et al .",
    "2011 ; silverman et al .",
    "2012b ) , it is usually not very strong .",
    "however , spectra of other sne  ia have generally not been obtained as early as our spectra of sn  2013dy .",
    "in fact , the @xmath86580 line weakens rapidly in sn  2013dy ; it became much weaker by 3.30d , and it is undetectable after an age of @xmath76 week .",
    "thus , the early discovery of sne  ia and timely spectroscopic observations are crucial for detecting the features and studying their evolution .",
    "the velocity of @xmath87234 is slightly lower than that of @xmath86580 in the 1.63d spectrum , and both are also a bit below that of the photospheric component of @xmath86355 , as seen in previous work ( e.g. , silverman et al .",
    "but after @xmath23d , their velocities are similar to each other .",
    "the presence of with velocity comparable to that of gives direct evidence that there exists some amount of unburned material .",
    "moreover , the presence of both ( often seen in normal sne  ia ) and suggests that the progenitor is probably a c+o white dwarf , consistent with the analysis of our early - time light curve .      using the supernova identification code ( snid ; blondin & tonry 2007 )",
    ", we find that sn  2013dy is spectroscopically similar to several normal sne  ia , though some of our early spectra ( 7.50 , 8.57 , 10.57d ) also resemble those of the peculiar sn  1999aa and similar events ( e.g. , li et al . 2001 ) .",
    "since the peak @xmath4-band brightness lies in the range of typical sn  ia luminosities , sn  2013dy is probably a normal sn  ia .",
    "in this _ letter _ we present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the type ia sn  2013dy , the earliest detection of an sn  ia thus far .",
