    "the discovery of the first circumstellar debris disk around a white dwarf ( wd ; g29 - 28 ) was made by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . since then , thanks to _ spitzer space telescope _ as well as large survey programs , over 20 wds have been identified to have debris disks ( see , e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "it is believed that such a debris disk is formed from material produced by tidal disruption of asteroids within the roche radius of a wd @xcite , since planetary material is known to commonly exist around the progenitor stars of wds and it has been suggested that part of the material can survive through late phases of stellar evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    this picture has been supported by derived properties of several gaseous metal disks around isolated wds @xcite , detailed infrared studies of the debris - disk wd systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and more common detections of absorption features of high - z metals in wd spectra ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the high - z spectral features are considered as a result of the processes of asteroids disruption and subsequent wd accretion of high - z material probably through a disk .",
    "the accreted material pollutes the expectedly  pure \" hydrogen or helium atmosphere ( @xcite ) , since the primordial metals within the atmospheres of wds sink rapidly @xcite .",
    "therefore , one important application of the observational studies of the polluted wds is that it can provide information about bulk elemental compositions of extrasolar planets ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the large survey of wd debris - disk systems is warranted as the resulting increased samples allow detailed studies of disk formation and accretion processes around wds @xcite , and that of the disk properties and disk - existence frequency indicating the corresponding properties of planetary bodies @xcite .",
    "recently , the data release 7 ( dr7 ) wd catalogue from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which contains nearly 20,000 sources , was released @xcite . using the infrared all - sky data from the wide field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) ,",
    "@xcite conducted a thorough search for infrared counterparts to wds in the dr7 catalogue , and found 52 candidate debris disks ( we name these sources ` dxxxx ' in this paper ) and 69 candidate counterparts with indeterminate infrared excess emission ( which were defined such because both a debris disk and a brown - dwarf companion can explain their excess emission ; these sources are named as ` ixxxx ' in this paper ) .",
    "for the first and latter types of the counterparts , there are 32 and 54 , respectively , that did not have detections at @xmath0 bands ( basically in either 2mass or ukidss survey ) .",
    "since wise imaging had a fwhm of @xmath16  @xcite , source confusion could cause mis - identification of excess emission . in order to identify the counterparts among these candidates and if identified , to provide more measurements for determining the debris - disk sources , we have carried out ground - based imaging of the candidates that did not have @xmath0 flux measurements . in this paper",
    "we report the results from our observations .",
    "we carried out observations with the 5.1-m hale telescope at palomar observatory in the united states . through the chinese telescope access program ,",
    "we were awarded two nights in 2012 november and two half nights in 2013 february .",
    "unfortunately , only the night of 2012 nov .",
    "2728 was clear and useful data were taken .",
    "the instrument used was the wide field ir camera ( wirc ; @xcite ) , which has a 2048@xmath22048  pixel@xmath3 hawaii - ii hgcdte detector .",
    "the pixel scale was 0249 pixel@xmath4 and the field of view was 87 .",
    "for the 86 wds we chose to observe , we used published results of their effective temperature and optical magnitudes to estimate their lower flux limits at @xmath0 bands ( @xcite ; see also table  [ tab : prop ] ) , assuming pure blackbody emission .",
    "based on the estimated flux limits , exposure times at the bands for each target were estimated accordingly .",
    "due to weather limitations , we observed only 12 wds ; the exposure times are given in table  [ tab : obs ] . during each exposure",
    ", the telescope was dithered in a five - point grid with offsets of @xmath5 40  to obtain a measurement of the sky background .",
    "the observing conditions were mediocre , with the seeing having a median value of 09 but occasionally dropping to 15 .",
    "we used iraf for our data reduction .",
    "the images were dark - subtracted and flat - field corrected . in addition a sky image was made by filtering out stars from each set of the dithered images in one exposure .",
    "the sky image was subtracted from the set of images , and then the sky - subtracted images were shifted and combined into one final image of a target field .    to calibrate our target images astrometrically , we used the in - field , relatively bright 2mass stars @xcite , the numbers of which were between eight and fifty , depending on the fields .",
    "the resulting nominal uncertainties of the calibrated images are in a range of 003011 .",
    "for most of our images , the uncertainties are dominated by the 2mass systematic uncertainty of @xmath6 015 ( with respect to the international celestial reference system ) .",
    "we used the iraf aperture photometry package apphot to measure the brightnesses of our sources for most of the images .",
    "for a few cases that a target was resolved to have a nearby source , the psf fitting package daophot was used . flux calibration was conducted by comparing to bright 2mass stars detected in our images .      launched in 2009 december 14 , wise mapped the entire sky at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22 @xmath7 m ( called w1 , w2 , w3 , and w4 bands , respectively ) in 2010 with fwhms of 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 , and 12.0   in the four bands , respectively ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the wise all - sky images and source catalogue were released in 2012 march .",
    "we downloaded the flux measurements of each target in the source catalogue and the wise image data of each target field from the infrared processing and analysis center .",
    "@xcite provided all magnitudes or magnitude upper limits of the wise candidate counterparts to the wd targets , but because they used the wise preliminary catalogues , the values were slightly different from those in the all - sky source catalogue .",
    "we therefore re - provided the magnitudes or magnitude upper limits of our 12 wd targets from the all - sky source catalogue in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "in our ground - based images , we detected all 12 targets , but we found that four of them were resolved as two sources at / near the wise source position .",
    "the fields of the four wds are shown in figure  [ fig : ds ] . from our astrometry",
    ", we determined the counterparts based on the measured positions and they are marked as object @xmath8 in figure  [ fig : ds ] .",
    "the nearby non - counterpart sources , which are 12  away from the counterparts , are marked as object @xmath9 .",
    "we also determined the positions and @xmath0 magnitudes of these nearby sources , and the values are given next to the counterparts in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "for the other eight targets , one single source was clearly detected at or near the sdss position . among them",
    "i0004 was detected by the 2mass survey , but because it had significant proper motion , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( our palomar measurement with respect to that of 2mass , which was made on 1998 sept .",
    "17 ) , it was not reported to have the 2mass detections ( the positional criterion for candidate counterpart identification was 20 in @xcite ) .",
    "combining sdss @xmath12 flux measurements @xcite and that from the wise all - sky source catalogue with our @xmath0 measurements , we constructed the flux density spectra for the 12 wd targets .",
    "the spectra are shown in figures  [ fig : dd ] and [ fig : bd ] .",
    "for the four wds with a nearby source , the nearby sources are included correspondingly in the figure ( displayed as circular data points ) .",
    "we compared our observational spectra with wd model spectra in the infrared bands ( kindly provided by p. bergeron ) , whose properties were determined by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and found that no significant excess emission at @xmath0 bands was detected for most of the wds except i0856 . for i0730 , d0813 , d0906 and i0913 , the emission detected by wise more likely came from their nearby source ( see section  [ sssec : bd ] below ) , and our observations excluded them as the wds with excess infrared emission .",
    "we observed 12 wds that were identified to have excess emission from the wise survey by @xcite but did not have previous @xmath0 measurements .",
    "given the excess emission , they have been suggested to either have a debris disk or a brown dwarf companion @xcite . from our observations , we found that seven of them did not have significant excess emission at @xmath0 bands , while i0856 had strong excess emission , consistent with fluxes measured at the sdss @xmath13 bands .",
    "in addition four wds were resolved to have a nearby source .",
    "below including our results , we first discuss the possible origins for the excess emission from the wds and for the resolved nearby sources , and then provide a summary for the discussion .",
    "for the seven wds without significant @xmath0 excess emission , they are not likely to have a very low - mass ( vlm ) star or a brown dwarf companion . for example , the @xmath14 magnitudes and their uncertainties are 1518 and @xmath50.1 , respectively . the uncertainties only allow the possible existence of 10% excess emission or 2.5  mag fainter sources . adding 2.5  mag to @xmath14 and comparing it to @xmath15 magnitudes , which are slightly lower than @xmath14 values ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) , such infrared sources would have a @xmath16 color of @xmath12.5 mag .",
    "the color is too red for vlm dwarfs ( see @xcite for the colors of the known vlm dwarfs ) .    with constraints from our @xmath0 measurements",
    ", we fit these sources with the debris disk model given by @xcite to study if the excess emission could arise from a debris disk . in the model , the disk temperature follows @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the effective temperature of a wd and @xmath19 the disk radius @xcite .",
    "we adopted the model parameters used in @xcite , assuming a temperature of @xmath20  k at the inner edge of the debris disk and an outer disk radius of 80@xmath21 , where @xmath21 is the radius of a wd .",
    "the distance , effective temperature , and extinction of each wd target were fixed at the values given in table  [ tab : prop ] @xcite .",
    "the free parameter was the inclination angle @xmath22 of the disk .",
    "we fit @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath23 ( or only @xmath14 and @xmath15 when there was no @xmath23 detection ) fluxes , where @xmath14 was included to serve as the additional constraint ( for i2317 , which had @xmath14 excess emission , @xmath24 band flux was included too ) .",
    "we also required that the model flux at @xmath23 band must be lower than the wise flux upper limit for the sources not detected at @xmath23 .",
    "we found that the excess emission from most of the sources is generally consistent with arising from a debris disk , and the resulting best - fit @xmath25 and @xmath26 values are summarized in table  [ tab : dd ] .",
    "the best - fit model fluxes for each source are shown in figure  [ fig : dd ] .    for i0836 and i2317 , the requirement of the model for the @xmath23 flux lower than the wise upper limit provided a constraint in the fitting .",
    "if this requirement is not considered , @xmath26 values would be much smaller . for i1010 and i1029 ,",
    "the @xmath26 values are quite large for @xmath27 .",
    "this is because their @xmath15 fluxes are significantly higher than their @xmath14 fluxes , and in order for the model to match the @xmath15 fluxes , the model fluxes were increased , thus inducing large @xmath26 values at @xmath14 band .",
    "we note that since the wise magnitudes of the wds are in a range of 1517 and wise photometry of such faint sources is known to have as large as @xmath50.4 mag systematic uncertainty , the poor fitting can be caused by the large uncertainties on wise photometry that are not included in the catalogue data . for the same reason",
    ", we did not further search for better fitting by varying the model parameters .",
    "however for the wds that show clear excess emission and are believed to have a debris disk , we know that : 1 ) they nearly all have effective temperatures in a range of 9,50024,000 k ( except g  166@xmath2858 for its @xmath29 k ; @xcite ) , 2 ) they nearly all are known to be metal - rich from optical spectroscopy @xcite , and 3 ) nearly half of them show significant emission excesses at infrared @xmath30-band relative to their wd model spectra .",
    "these properties make the identification of the seven wds as candidates with debris disks highly questionable .",
    "the seven wds generally do not fit in any of them ( tables  [ tab : prop ] & [ tab : dd ] ; @xcite ) .      since wise imaging had relatively low spatial resolution , it can not be determined solely based on the positions whether or not the wise sources are the counterparts to the nearby sources of i0730 , d0813 , d0906 , and i0913 ( object @xmath9 in figure  [ fig : ds ] ) . combining our @xmath0 measurements with the wise fluxes , as shown in figure  [ fig : bd ] , the overall broad - band spectra suggest that the wise sources are the counterparts to the four nearby sources , or at least emission from the nearby sources dominated over that from the four wds ( otherwise these nearby sources would have to have an unlikely , large flux decrease from @xmath14 to @xmath15 )",
    ". since the sources are red and three of them ( nearby to ixxxx sources ) were classified by @xcite to be possible candidate brown dwarfs , we fit their broad - band spectra with that of vlm stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "following @xcite , we used the empirical spectra for m , l , and t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we first fixed the distances at the values of the wds , and found that the resulting @xmath26 were large ( the values and the best - fit spectral types are given in column four and three , respectively , of table  [ tab : bd ] ) . setting the distance as a free parameter",
    ", the best - fit @xmath26 can be significantly reduced ( see the values at column seven of table  [ tab : bd ] ) . therefore ,",
    "if the sources are m or l dwarfs , as identified from our fitting , they are most likely not associated with the wds .",
    "the best - fit spectra of the four sources are shown in figure  [ fig : bd ] .",
    "in addition for i0856 , since it had significant excess emission starting from the optical @xmath31 to @xmath0 bands comparing to the wd model spectrum , the debris - disk model we used , which assumed a low - temperature disk , could not provide a reasonably well fit .",
    "we thus tested with the vlm dwarf models , and found that an l0 dwarf at the wd s distance of 428 pc can generally describe the excess emission except at the @xmath15 band ( figure  [ fig : bd ] ) . here",
    "again given the large uncertainties on the wise measurements of faint sources , we considered the fitting was acceptable although the reduced @xmath26 is @xmath32 ( table  [ tab : bd ] ) .",
    "the wd targets are located away from the galactic plane having clean source fields according to the sdss optical and our @xmath0 images .",
    "however , it has been shown from _",
    "imaging that at @xmath33 mag in the wavelength range of 310  @xmath7 m , galaxies dominate in such regions @xcite .",
    "for example as our wd targets have @xmath15 magnitudes in a range of 1517 mag , at its middle value of 16  mag , the _ spitzer",
    "_ galaxy count at 3.6 @xmath7 m was @xmath62300 mag@xmath4  deg@xmath34 @xcite or 1.8@xmath35 mag@xmath4  arcsec@xmath34 .",
    "considering the 2  radius circular region , which was used by @xcite for searching for wd counterparts , there will be a chance of 0.23% to randomly find at least one 16 mag galaxy in such a region .",
    "the percentage is low but there were nearly 18,000 times searches ( for 17,955 unique and valid targets ; @xcite ) , which would result in 40 randomly - detected galaxies .",
    "approximately 300 wds per mag were detected at @xmath36 mag , but excluding 23% naked wds ( detection of wd photosphere only ) and 67% candidate wd plus m dwarf binaries @xcite , the latter we consider rather certain due to their brightnesses and colors , only 30 per mag would be either debris - disk or brown - dwarf companion systems among the candidates . the numbers thus suggest that the detected excess emission is likely caused by unresolved background galaxies due to wise s relatively low spatial resolution and those nearby sources are also likely galaxies .      among the 12 wd targets identified with excess emission from the wise data , our observations and analysis",
    "show that seven are consistent with having a debris disk , but their properties are not in the likely range for the detectable disks on the basis of the currently known debris - disk wds . among the other five wd targets ,",
    "four are found that their excess emission is caused by the existence of a nearby red source and the remaining one , i0856 , shows significant excess emission at @xmath0 bands .",
    "our analysis suggests that the nearby sources are possibly unassociated vlm stars or brown dwarfs while excess emission from i0856 is suggestive of an l0 dwarf .",
    "however , we also realize that the excess emission ( and the nearby sources ) might well be caused by background galaxies , which are known to be the dominant , relatively faint sources at wavelengths between 310 @xmath7 m .",
    "therefore , in order to investigate the true nature of the observed excess emission or nearby sources , imaging with _ spitzer _ is needed .",
    "the _ spitzer _",
    "observations will possibly resolve background galaxies from the wd targets and provide accurate flux measurements at the infrared wavelengths of @xmath15 and @xmath23 bands , both helping identify the debris disks and vlm dwarfs .",

    "<S> we have carried out @xmath0 imaging of 12 white dwarf debris disk candidates from the wired sdss dr7 catalog , aiming to confirm or rule out disks among these sources . </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of positional identification and the flux density spectra , we find that seven white dwarfs have excess infrared emission , but mostly at wise w1 and w2 bands , four are due to nearby red objects consistent with background galaxies or very low mass dwarfs , and one exhibits excess emission at @xmath0 consistent with an unresolved l0 companion at the correct distance . while our photometry is not inconsistent with all seven excesses arising from disks , the stellar properties are distinct from the known population of debris disk white dwarfs , making the possibility questionable . in order to further investigate the nature of these infrared sources , </S>",
    "<S> warm spitzer imaging is needed , which may help resolve galaxies from the white dwarfs and provide more accurate flux measurements . </S>"
