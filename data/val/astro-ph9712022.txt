    "the galaxy ngc 4550 , an e7/s0 lenticular galaxy in the virgo cluster , was discovered by rubin et al .",
    "( 1992 ) to be a galaxy consisting of two coeval , coplanar , and counter - rotating stellar disks .",
    "many other cases of counter - rotation are now known in ellipticals and also in spirals , but what makes the case of ngc 4550 particular ( kuijken , fisher , & merrifield 1996 ) is that the mass ratio of the counter - rotating disks is nearly @xmath0 . in the case of ellipticals counter - rotation",
    "is so frequent ( e.g.  schweizer 1998 ) that the merger or accretion origins seem the most likely explanations for such kinematic misalignments .",
    "the difficulty with a merger scenario for ngc 4550 is that strong disk mergers usually lead to ellipticals and the destruction of the disks , a `` truth '' often believed to be general since the seminal paper of toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) .",
    "thakar & ryden ( 1996 ) have shown that over several gyr a series of well correlated small _ gaseous _ merger events can lead to a massive counter - rotating gaseous disk .",
    "but then this scenario requires to preserve special correlations over several gyr , contrary to a single event .",
    "thus , it remains open whether a single merger of two equal mass spirals can result in some circumstances to a galaxy like ngc 4550 .    in a forthcoming paper ( pfenniger & puerari 1998 ) we will present in more details the general conditions leading to moderate heating .",
    "in addition to mass and energy , one must also consider the angular momentum in the final budget .",
    "an input of specific angular momentum tends to cool the system , while inputs of specific energy and mass tend to heat it .",
    "since ngc 4550 is a rare object , a generic process is not required ; exceptional conditions can be acceptable and should be expected .",
    "after various considerations we have retained : * 1 . * a nearly circular orbit of the initial disks , supposing that the excess energy of galaxies coming from infinity has already been absorbed by some outer matter .",
    "* initial disks with opposite spins ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "counter - rotating disks are ideal for minimizing shocks in outer gaseous disks . also the retrograde disk is less affected by tidal interactions .",
    "nearly or exactly coplanar disks in the orbital plane .",
    "this may look a rather improbable situation , but a favorable factor to align the disk spins is to have initially flattened dark matter ( the torques on misaligned disks is then high ) .",
    "several arguments , such as the high frequency of warped outer hi disks with straight line of nodes , do suggest flattened dark mass distributions in spirals ( see pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "the simulations presented here were run in geneva .",
    "independently , puerari run similar simulations in mexico .",
    "we intend to publish jointly both sets of simulations since they lead to the same conclusions despite different choices of initial parameters . in particular puerari s simulations include round massive halos , showing that the shape of the halos does not change the qualitative results , and his disks start on more elongated orbits .    in view of the poor understanding of gaseous processes in galaxies leading to exaggerate viscosity with the sph technique ( see thakar & ryden 1996 ) , we simulate first only the collisionless gravity part .",
    "obviously the resulting heating is enhanced with respect to simulations including gas .",
    "our two initial disks are identical , except for the initial coordinates .",
    "they consist of a bulge , with a scale - length of 1kpc , an exponential disk with horizontal and vertical scale - lengths of 3 and 0.5kpc , and a flaring ( @xmath1 ) massive `` dark '' disk with a constant surface density up to 10kpc , decreasing as @xmath2 between 10 and 30kpc , and as @xmath3 between 30 and 60kpc",
    ". the mass ratios of the three components are respectively ( 0.25:1:5 ) , and the particle masses are all equal . the particle velocities are found by solving the jeans equation for each component in the total potential , assuming velocity dispersions ellipsoids parallel to cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the potential of the mass distribution is calculated with a set of @xmath4 particles on the geneva pm polar grid code .    a rapid run of coplanar counter - rotating disks merger is performed with the pm code with @xmath5 particles .",
    "the result is positive but not fully convincing since during the merging process substantial changes of positions of the mass distribution occur within the grid , which has a position dependent resolution .",
    "therefore , we select out a subset of @xmath6 particles , the mass of which is multiplied by a factor 20 to keep the same total mass",
    ". the particle subset is then run with the barnes - hut ( 1989 ) treecode ( with an opening angle of @xmath7=0.5 ) , which does not imply any geometrical assumptions . in several experiments we verify that slight initial disk inclinations with the orbital plane ( 5@xmath8 )",
    "still lead to counter - rotating coplanar disks .",
    "here we just describe the strictly coplanar disk merger .",
    "1 , left , shows the initial particle distribution with the senses of rotation .",
    "the disks are on a prograde near circular orbit .",
    "the tidal perturbation creates immediately ( at @xmath9200myr ) a bar in each disks , persisting until the disks merge .",
    "the merging process conserves the disks fairly well , the less damaged one being the retrograde one .",
    "fig .  1 ,",
    "middle , shows the inner remnant disk at @xmath10=1500myr , still containing 80% of the initial total mass , almost circular and barless .",
    "fig .  1 , right , shows the large - scale particle distribution , at @xmath10=1500myr .",
    "the excess angular momentum is transported by 10 - 20% of the mass , mostly of the prograde disk , to large distances , 100500kpc .",
    "fig .  2 shows how the average line profiles as seen in the edge - on disks change from unimodal to bimodal .",
    "the bimodal distribution is crucial in order to distinguish counter - rotating disks from a hot population with a zero net rotation",
    ". the ratios of final to initial velocity dispersion amount to @xmath92.4 in the radial direction , and @xmath92 in the vertical direction .",
    "the final mass distribution follows well a @xmath11 profile . with a relatively limited heating the final disk resembles both in shape and kinematics a typical s0/e7 galaxy , with",
    ", in addition , marked counter - rotating populations .    at some moments during the merging process the system as seen edge - on looks like a single galaxy but with two bulges",
    "such a case of `` two - bulge '' looking galaxy is pgc 57064 in the hercules cluster .",
    "we have shown that counter - rotating co - spatial disks can be made by a single spiral - spiral merger .",
    "the required initial conditions are somewhat peculiar , but favored if the dark matter distribution is flat ; however , this is not a necessary condition .",
    "the strong reaction of the disks , expelling 1020% of the mass to 100500kpc , means that dark matter in such systems must be distributed in a pronounced asymmetric way for several gyr .",
    "thus , in many spirals the outer ( dark ) mass distribution should still be chaotic ."
