    "the formation mechanism of brown dwarfs , star - like objects whose masses are too low to sustain hydrogen fusion in their interiors , has remained a theoretical puzzle ever since they were first detected .",
    "they pose a problem for standard star formation theories relying on gravitational collapse of molecular cloud material because their masses are substantially smaller than the typical jeans mass in such a cloud .",
    "although considerable theoretical and observational effort has been expended , there is still no clear consensus on how brown dwarfs form .",
    "popular theoretical ideas can be divided into three major sub - groups .",
    "the first relies on finding some mechanism to produce a sufficiently low - mass core _ ab initio _ , while circumventing the jeans mass problem .",
    "this can be done , for example , by turbulent fragmentation of cloud material ( e.g. @xcite ) , fragmentation and subsequent collapse of molecular cloud cores ( e.g. @xcite ) or erosion of cores by ionizing radiation from nearby massive stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the second posits that brown dwarfs form as part of multiple systems ( which collapse from a single large overdensity , thus circumventing the jeans mass problem ) , and are then ejected before they can accrete sufficient mass to become normal hydrogen burning stars ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "finally , disk fragmentation mechanisms ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) are proposed , by which stars and brown dwarfs form by gravitational instability .",
    "similar mechanisms have been proposed for planet formation ( e.g. @xcite ) , and @xcite note that disk fragmentation in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks naturally leads to the formation of brown dwarfs .",
    "multiple systems offer an important clue as to the nature of the star formation process and could give an insight into the problem of brown dwarf formation .",
    "observations indicate that while multiple systems are extremely common for solar type stars , with approximately @xmath3 of systems found to harbor one or more components ( e.g. @xcite ) , the multiplicity fraction appears to decline through m spectral types to the brown dwarf domain , with only @xmath4 of field m - dwarf systems being multiple ( e.g. @xcite ) . the fraction could be as low as @xmath5 for late - m and l - dwarfs , although there is some disagreement in the literature regarding corrections for the effects of survey biases , particularly in binary semimajor axis ( see @xcite and references therein for a review ) .",
    "one formation mechanism that naturally generates a low multiplicity fraction for brown dwarfs is the ejection hypothesis mentioned above @xcite since it relies on dynamical interactions , which would likely disrupt most binary brown dwarf systems .",
    "however , this mechanism has difficulty explaining other observational evidence , such as the existence of disks around brown dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) , which would also be disrupted by dynamical interactions .",
    "in addition , binary systems have long been a cornerstone in our understanding of the fundamental properties of stars because gravity provides one of the few model - independent means to precisely measure the mass of a star for comparison with other fundamental properties , thus allowing us to test stellar evolution theory .",
    "double - lined eclipsing binaries ( ebs ) are particularly useful in this regard , where combined analysis of light curves and radial velocity information can determine masses and radii for both stars to very high precision ( @xcite ; see also the classic review by @xcite ) .",
    "results of recent dynamical mass measurements for brown dwarf binaries indicate that the there may be substantial discrepancies between the predictions of evolutionary models and the observed masses and luminosities of the objects , by factors of up to @xmath6 .",
    "there has been some debate in the literature as to the nature of these discrepancies , with the earliest example finding the luminosities were overpredicted for a given mass ( @xcite ; but this may have been due to an error in the spectral type , see @xcite ) , whereas other studies found they are underpredicted @xcite , or indicate no discrepancy ( e.g. @xcite ; and @xcite for an intriguing object at the l / t transition ) . by making measurements of an unprecedentedly large sample of objects , @xcite conclude that the discrepancies are a function of spectral type , with late - m to mid - l systems having luminosities overpredicted by the theoretical models , and one t - type system having a luminosity which is underpredicted , indicating that the sense of the discrepancies may reverse moving to later spectral types .",
    "furthermore , the evolutionary and atmospheric models may indeed be inconsistent with one another ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , indicating systematic errors in one or both classes of models .",
    "the only well - characterized double lined brown dwarf eb is perhaps even more puzzling , showing a reversal in effective temperatures of the two objects , with the more massive brown dwarf being cooler @xcite .",
    "this is thought to be due to magnetic activity in this extremely young ( @xmath7 ) system @xcite .",
    "what is clear is that even more dynamical measurements of brown dwarfs are needed , to place these results on a firmer footing and to probe a wider range of parameter space .    in this work we present the detection of an eclipsing brown dwarf orbiting the lower - mass member of a known field m - dwarf visual double , and , which we show are highly likely to be physically associated .",
    "the observation of eclipses constrains the orbital inclination , and thus allows the secondary mass to be ascertained through radial velocity measurements with essentially no @xmath8 ambiguity .",
    "the properties of the parent m - dwarf can also be constrained from the eclipse measurements .",
    "such an object represents an opportunity to constrain formation and evolutionary models of both m - dwarfs and brown dwarfs .",
    "eclipses in nltt  41135 were initially detected from data taken during 2009 february to may ( inclusive ) as part of routine operation of the mearth observatory , a system designed primarily to search for transiting super - earth exoplanets orbiting around the nearest @xmath9 mid to late m - dwarfs in the northern hemisphere ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "exposure times on each field observed by mearth are tailored to achieve sensitivity to the same planet size for the assumed parameters of each target star , and were @xmath10 for the field containing nltt  41135 .",
    "data were reduced using the standard mearth reduction pipeline , which is at present nearly identical to the monitor project pipeline described in @xcite .",
    "we used an aperture radius of @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) ; note that the mearth telescopes were operated slightly out of focus in the 2008 september to 2009 july observing season to increase the number of photons that can be gathered before saturation of the detector for our brightest targets .",
    "this star was identified as a high - priority candidate from a box - fitting least squares ( bls ) transit search ( following closely the methods of @xcite ) , performed on de - trended , median filtered light curves .",
    "we used a @xmath13-day median filter @xcite to remove stellar variability , followed by a trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; @xcite ) based on searching for optimal linear combinations of comparison star light curves to best remove any systematic effects in the target light curve .",
    "the photometry indicated a period of approximately @xmath14 , and a @xmath15 eclipse depth , with no secondary eclipses visible in the mearth data .",
    "we immediately switched to a follow - up mode after the initial detection , observing the object at the highest possible cadence ( approximately @xmath13 minutes including overheads ) during the night of ut 2009 may 25 when an eclipse was predicted to occur .",
    "this was confirmed with high significance , although any measurements of the eclipse shape were severely corrupted by the target crossing the meridian during the eclipse , which necessitates a temporary halt in the observations and rotation of the telescope optics and detector system through @xmath16 relative to the sky with our german equatorial mounts . in practice",
    ", the telescope guiding takes some time to recover after this , and photometry is corrupted during the recovery period .",
    "therefore while we were able to confirm the reality of the event , the mearth data are not useful in determining the eclipse shape or physical properties of the object .    due to the close proximity of nltt  41135 and 41136 ,",
    "these stars are unresolved in the mearth observations , and indeed are also unresolved or improperly resolved in many well - known literature sources for measurements of bright stars .",
    "it was initially not clear which member of the m - dwarf pair was undergoing eclipses , so we pursued photometric ( resolved light curves ) and spectroscopic ( radial velocity ) methods to determine the identity of the eclipsing star .",
    "the spectroscopic method gave the earliest indication that nltt 41135 was responsible for the eclipses .",
    "the high proper motion of the pair allows us to constrain the contribution of any additional background stars in the photometric aperture that are not co - moving with nltt  41135 and 41136 , using previous epochs of imaging .",
    "we show in figure [ third_light_images ] a series of three images centered on the position of the photometric aperture used in the mearth images .",
    "these show that there is a fainter star located approximately @xmath17 arcsec to the east and @xmath18 arcsec to the north of the blended pair at the mearth epoch . using the apm on - line sky catalog ,",
    "this star is @xmath19 magnitudes fainter than the blended image of nltt  41135 and 41136 in the poss-1 red ( e ) plate , and @xmath20 magnitudes fainter in the blue ( o ) plate . while this star is at the edge of the mearth photometric aperture and",
    "thus will affect the eclipse depths measured from these data , we have ensured that this star was excluded from the apertures used to analyze the follow - up data described in the subsequent sections , and its fainter magnitude and bluer color should ensure any contamination in the far - red bandpasses used in this work is negligible .",

    "data are from the first and second epoch palomar sky surveys as provided by the digitized sky survey ( dss ; top and center panels ) , and the mearth master image ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the two stars are unresolved , although elongation of the combined image is visible in the poss-2 ( center ) panel .",
    "the approximate epochs of the images are @xmath21 ( poss-1 ) , @xmath22 ( poss-2 ) , and @xmath23 ( mearth ) .",
    "all three panels have the same center , scale and alignment on - sky , with north up and east to the left , covering approximately @xmath24 in the horizontal direction.,width=268 ]    our mearth light curves show variations out of eclipse .",
    "these have a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath25 , and rms scatter of @xmath26 .",
    "there is no clear period , and it is not clear which member of the pair is responsible for the variations . our photometry is corrupted somewhat by the partially - resolved nature of the pair , so we regard this measurement as an upper limit to the actual variability level , noting that the absence of a clear period may be indicative of some or all of the measured variation being spurious .      in order to determine the flux ratio of the m - dwarf pair , and hence the intrinsic flux decrement during eclipse , we obtained a single , resolved image of the system using the orthogonal parallel transfer imaging camera ( optic ; @xcite ; @xcite ) on the university of hawaii 2.2 m telescope , during the night of ut 2009 june 9 .",
    "this instrument uses two @xmath28 `` orthogonal transfer '' ccds ( e.g. @xcite ) which allow parallel transfers of the charge through the image area in both the @xmath29 and @xmath30 directions .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath31/pix on the 2.2 m telescope , giving a field of view of @xmath32 .",
    "an exposure time of @xmath33 was used in good seeing conditions through the @xmath27 filter .",
    "the heliocentric julian date of mid - exposure was @xmath34 , corresponding to an orbital phase of @xmath35 ( close to quadrature ) for the nltt  41135 system ( see  [ ephem_sect ] ) .",
    "this single image was bias - subtracted using the overscan region , and flat - fielded before using our standard source detection software to obtain positions and aperture photometry for both stars in the pair .",
    "we measured an angular separation of @xmath36 , and a flux ratio of @xmath37 , where we have assumed a conservative error based on multiple measurements of the image made using different sized apertures .",
    "this quantity will later be used in the analysis of unresolved light curves of the system to extract the parameters of the eclipsing binary , nltt  41135 . in this context",
    "it is usually referred to as `` third light '' , and shall hereafter be labeled with the symbol @xmath38 for consistency with the usual nomenclature in the eclipsing binary literature .",
    "it is important to consider the possible influence of stellar variability on the value of @xmath38 . using the results stated in ",
    "[ mearth_obs_sect ] , in a similar passband , the most pessimistic assumption is to assign all of the measured variation to nltt  41135 , giving a contribution to the fractional uncertainty in @xmath38 of @xmath39 ( rms ) .",
    "our assumed uncertainty of @xmath40 ( a fractional uncertainty of @xmath5 ) in @xmath38 is already sufficient to account for this , and the additional contribution from variability is probably negligible .",
    "an attempt to obtain a resolved light curve was made on the night of ut 2009 june 17 .",
    "exposure times of @xmath41 were used through the @xmath27 filter .",
    "we used the orthogonal parallel transfer capability of the optic detector to shift charge during the exposure in an attempt to perform a tip - tilt correction of the incoming wavefronts to improve the fwhm of the images .",
    "however , due to technical problems this instead caused severe corruption of the point spread functions , which limits the utility of the resulting light curve . in addition , during the eclipse the guiding lock was lost which caused a short gap in the phase coverage .",
    "nonetheless , we were able to extract resolved photometry of the two stars by performing standard aperture photometry on the resulting images .",
    "an aperture radius of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) was found to give the best compromise between flux losses from the aperture and cross - contamination of the point spread functions of the two stars .",
    "we used nltt  41136 as the comparison star to extract differential photometry of nltt  41135 , which has the additional advantage of canceling much of the cross - contaminated flux between the two objects and hence providing a more accurate measurement of the true eclipse depth .",

    "we obtained two epochs on each star in the visual binary close to the predicted times of quadratures from the photometric ephemeris , in order to search for large - amplitude radial velocity variability .",
    "one hour exposures were obtained in june 2009 over a four day period .",
    "the radial velocities were extracted using a custom - built pipeline to rectify and cross correlate the spectra .",
    "this pipeline was identical to the one used for the nordic optical telescope data and will be described in the next section .",
    "the two radial velocities of nltt  41135 from tres showed variations in phase with the prediction from the photometric ephemeris , giving an initial estimate of the rv semi - amplitude of @xmath144 .",
    "we cross correlated the spectra of the two stars and subtracted the orbital motion of the low - mass companion of nltt  41135 .",

    "we found a velocity difference of @xmath145 over @xmath146 , which is consistent with the pair being physically bound , within the errors .",

    "each observation was split into three separate exposures , enabling us to combine the raw images using median filtering , removing virtually all cosmic rays .",
    "we use a flat field to trace the chelle orders and to correct the pixel to pixel variations in ccd response , then extract one - dimensional spectra using the `` optimal extraction '' algorithm of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the scattered light in the two - dimensional raw image is determined and removed by masking out the signal in the chelle orders and fitting the inter - order scattered light flux with a two - dimensional polynomial .",
    "the fies sky fiber was broken at the time these observations were taken , so sky subtraction could not be performed .",
    "unfortunately , this means we are also unable to measure equivalent widths , e.g. to characterize the activity of the star .",
    "thorium argon ( thar ) calibration images were obtained through the science fiber before and after each stellar observation .",
    "the two calibration images are combined to form the basis for the fiducial wavelength calibration .",
    "fies and tres are not vacuum spectrographs and are only temperature controlled to 1/10 of a degree .",
    "consequently , the radial velocity errors are dominated by shifts due to pressure , humidity and temperature variations . in order to successfully remove these large variations ( @xmath151 ) ,",
    "it is critical that the thar light travels along the same optical path as the stellar light and thus acts as an effective proxy to remove these variations .",
    "we have therefore chosen to sandwich the stellar exposure with two thar frames instead of using the simultaneous thar fiber , which may not exactly describe the induced shifts in the science fiber and can also lead to bleeding of thar light into the science spectrum from the strong argon lines , especially at redder wavelengths .",
    "the pairs of thar exposures are co - added to improve the signal to noise ratio , and centers of the thar lines are found by fitting a gaussian function to the line profiles and a two - dimensional fifth order legendre polynomial is used to describe the wavelength solution .",

    "while it is usually possible ( with sufficiently high - quality data ) to fit for all three geometric parameters ( @xmath247 , @xmath137 and @xmath248 ) of a total eclipse , it is important to note that this is not possible for a grazing eclipse , because the second and third contact points are no longer seen in the light curve . in the simple case with no limb darkening and a dark secondary ,",
    "this can be understood as follows . for a total eclipse ,",
    "it is straightforward to show that the eclipse depth is determined by the area ratio between the two objects , and is thus equal to @xmath253 . the eclipse duration , and the duration ( or equivalently , slope ) of the partial phases ( first to second contact , and third to fourth contact )",
    "are determined by @xmath137 and @xmath248 ( e.g. see @xcite for a detailed derivation ) . in the grazing case , although we still know the eclipse duration and the slope of the partial phases , we do not know what the level of the `` bottom '' of a total eclipse would be .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath247 is essentially undetermined without external information on the other two .",
    "since we are primarily interested in @xmath137 and @xmath248 , we adopt a weak bayesian prior on the most poorly determined parameter , @xmath247 , and marginalize over this parameter to determine the distribution of possible values of the other two .",
    "in addition , the grazing light curve only constrains the limb darkening parameters very weakly , so we fix these at values appropriate for the @xmath27 passband from @xcite using the effective temperature from table [ photparams ] and assuming @xmath254 and solar metallicity . the theoretical uncertainty in limb darkening parameters for the @xmath27 passband should be negligible compared to the intrinsic degeneracies in the modeling of the grazing eclipse for the present case .    in order to derive parameters and reliable error estimates , we adopt a variant of the popular markov chain monte carlo analysis frequently applied for transiting exoplanet systems ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "j and to some extent h show more favorable eclipse depths than k due to the familiar blueward shift of the @xmath450 and @xmath451 colors for t - dwarfs resulting from h@xmath452 and ch@xmath453 absorption features .    assuming m - band to be a reasonable proxy for the longest - wavelength ( @xmath454 ) _ warm spitzer _",
    "channel , this eclipse might be detectable , although it is likely that _ spitzer _ s poor angular resolution would result in the images of nltt  41135 and 41136 being blended , thus diluting the eclipse depths by a factor of @xmath455 .",
    "whilst the eclipses should still be detectable for the youngest ages we have considered , this might become extremely challenging at the more likely age of @xmath456 . due to the rapid decline in j - band as a function of age , a similar statement applies for the prospects of detection using near - infrared instruments aboard the _ hubble space telescope_.    with the _ james webb space telescope _ , the secondary eclipse detection should be straightforward , and the predicted angular resolution is sufficient to resolve the m - dwarf pair even out to the mid - infrared .",
    "it is interesting to speculate that if the secondary eclipse was total ( which we stress is very unlikely given the essentially circular orbit and grazing geometry of the primary eclipse ) , this would yield the bandpass - integrated luminosity of the brown dwarf directly from the eclipse depth , and would break the degeneracy inherent in the modeling of the grazing eclipses in conjunction with the radial velocity , yielding also the radii of both components .",
    "finally , we note that it may be possible to derive a relatively crude constraint on the radius of the brown dwarf even in the most likely case where both eclipses are grazing .",
    "recall from  [ lc_sect ] that we assumed a prior on the system radius ratio in order to determine @xmath248 .",
    "however if we knew the radius of the m - dwarf , @xmath248 would be already completely determined and could be fixed in the model , allowing us to instead constrain @xmath247 .",
    "this could be done by measuring the angular diameter of nltt  41135 , in conjunction with a parallax and a k - band magnitude measurement to determine its mass .",
    "due to the remaining strong degeneracies between @xmath247 and @xmath137 it is unlikely that this measurement would yield @xmath247 to any better than @xmath457 ( see figure [ lcmodparamsplot ] ) .",
    "using the @xcite models , we estimate a mass ratio of @xmath458 for the m - dwarf visual pair from the effective temperatures in table [ photparams ] ( assuming @xmath307 } = -0.5 $ ] , @xmath459 age and the value of @xmath303 from table [ physparams ] ) . assuming the mass of nltt  41135 from table [ physparams ] ,",
    "this implies the mass of nltt  41136 is approximately @xmath460 , and the total system mass is therefore @xmath461 .",
    "the angular separation of @xmath36 corresponds to a projected physical separation of @xmath462 at @xmath463 distance . given this information",
    ", we can estimate a minimum orbital period of @xmath464 using newton s version of kepler s third law .",
    "given the long orbital period , it will be challenging to measure the parameters of the astrometric orbit unless its orientation or eccentricity are extremely favorable , although the motion of the components relative to their presumed common proper motion could be as large as a few tens of milliarcseconds per year especially if the orbit is viewed face - on .",
    "the maximum radial velocity difference between the pair corresponding to this period is @xmath465 ( assuming an edge - on orbit ) , which is reasonably consistent with our measurements from the tres spectroscopy ( see  [ tres_sect ] ) provided the measurements were taken at less than the maximum separation or the orbit is not edge - on .",
    "we have reported the discovery of a hierarchical triple system containing two m - dwarfs and a brown dwarf orbiting the less massive of the pair in an eclipsing system .",
    "the masses of the components are approximately in the ratio @xmath2 .",
    "the existence of this object poses a challenge to theories of brown dwarf formation .",
    "the configuration of the system strongly resembles a scaled - down ( in mass ) version of a relatively common configuration for solar - type stars .",
    "the mass ratio of only @xmath466 for the eclipsing binary component of the system would seem to be difficult to produce by disk fragmentation , because it would require an extraordinarily massive disk surrounding the forming m - dwarf core .",
    "given this difficulty it seems likely that this object may have formed in the same manner as its higher - mass analogs : directly from gravitational collapse of an overdensity in a molecular cloud .",
    "it is interesting to postulate that if many such systems are made by the star formation process , there will be some that are dynamically unstable , and may eject one or more of their components . as proposed in the ejection hypothesis of brown dwarf formation @xcite , this may offer a mechanism to produce single brown dwarfs , although as discussed in ",
    "[ intro_sect ] , evidence such as the existence of single brown dwarfs with discs argues against this being the only mechanism for brown dwarf formation .",
    "it is interesting to compare the secondary of the present system with the secondary of the corot-3 system , a @xmath467 brown dwarf orbiting an f3v star @xcite .",
    "the brown dwarfs in the two systems have similar masses , and their orbital periods differ by only @xmath468 , yet corot-3b orbits a star of luminosity @xmath469 times greater than does nltt  41135b , and thus experiences a @xmath470 times greater ( bolometric ) stellar insolation .",
    "this means that while the energy budget of nltt  41135b is most likely dominated by internal energy sources , corot-3b will be dominated by insolation .",
    "it would thus be extremely interesting to compare the observed physical properties of these objects to obtain insights into brown dwarf physics , for example the efficiency of re - distribution of energy from the day - side to the night - side of corot-3b , as has been done for extrasolar planets ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we also note that these objects may have formed through different mechanisms , since the mass ratio for the corot-3 system of @xmath471 ( an order of magnitude lower than for nltt  41135b ) may be difficult to produce via conventional mechanisms thought to be responsible for binary star formation .",
    "nltt  41135b is also of comparable mass to the secondary in the double - lined brown dwarf eb 2mass  j05352184 - 0546085 ( @xcite ) , although it is of much older age and orbits a main sequence star .",
    "nonetheless , these objects are probably quite close to being evolutionary analogues of one another , and both have an energy budget most likely dominated by internal energy sources .",
    "the present system provides a dynamical mass for a field brown dwarf , and offers the potential to allow models of brown dwarf evolution to be tested at extremely old ages , where dynamical constraints are scarce . in order to test the theory , we must attempt to determine or constrain the system age , in addition to measuring another fundamental property of the brown dwarf .",
    "the most accessible measurement is the secondary eclipse , which in conjunction with the primary eclipse yields a measurement of the central surface brightness ratio of the two components from the ratio of the eclipse depths .",
    "finally , we note that a major limitation in the determination of the brown dwarf mass and m - dwarf parameters is the uncertainty in the mass of nltt  41135a .",
    "we suggest that the best prospect for improvement would be to obtain an accurate trigonometric parallax for this object , in conjunction with resolved near - infrared apparent magnitude measurements ( preferably in k - band ) .",
    "this should yield an estimate for the metallicity , and thus the primary mass to @xmath334 , giving an improved solution for the eclipsing binary to more tightly constrain models of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
