    "@xcite ) allows us to model the large scale structure of the universe @xcite and calculate the anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and compare them to the data from experiments , e.g.   wmap .",
    "however , with the advent of new data sets , such as those from the full seven year running of wmap @xcite or those anticipated from the recently launched planck satellite @xcite , which are superior in both their quality and quantity to previous ones , we are now in a position to test predictions of higher order perturbation theory against observational data .",
    "conversely , perturbation theory beyond linear order is necessary in order to extract the maximum amount of information from these data sets , and thus utilise them to their full potential .",
    "the second order theory has been developed by several authors ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and there have been studies of the applications of the theory ranging from calculations of the non - gaussianity of the primordial perturbations to investigations of higher order phenomena produced by couplings between lower order perturbations .",
    "it is well known that at linear order in perturbation theory , different types of perturbations ( classified as scalar , vector and tensor perturbations , according to their transformation behaviour on three dimensional hypersurfaces ) decouple @xcite . however , at second order ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and beyond @xcite , this is no longer the case , and mode couplings exist which give rise to novel , interesting features .",
    "one well - studied example of such a higher order effect is that of gravitational waves sourced by first order density perturbations . this topic has received a lot of recent attention @xcite and the contribution of the second order tensors to the tensor spectrum has been studied in some detail .",
    "+ the production of vorticity at second order in perturbation theory is another effect that only becomes important at this and higher orders in a friedmann - robertson - walker background , and is the focus of the current work . for the case of a barotropic fluid ref .",
    "@xcite showed that vorticity is not produced at any order in perturbation theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite we showed , dropping this assumption of barotropicity , that vorticity is indeed generated at second order .",
    "we considered a generic perfect fluid , i.e.  a fluid whose energy momentum tensor is diagonal ( see , e.g.  ref .",
    "the source term of the vorticity evolution equation contains terms coupling the linear energy density and non - adiabatic pressure ( entropy ) perturbations .",

    ", we can see that even in the absence of anisotropic stress , terms quadratic in the first order perturbations will act as source terms for the vorticity tensor at second order .",
    "this is very different from the case at linear order where , in the absence of anisotropic stress , the vorticity has no source term and will decay with the expansion of the universe @xcite .    to keep our results conservative and our calculation as simple as possible and hence analytically tractable , we assume that the source term in eq .",

    "having found the exact analytical solution we approximate it by a power law valid at early times .",
    "the evolution and constraint equations are given by energy - momentum conservation and the einstein field equations , respectively .",
    "in the background , these are the familiar continuity and friedmann equations of a frw universe , namely @xmath22 at first order , the governing evolution and constraint equations are , in the left- and right - hand columns respectively , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the spatial laplacian , and we have introduced the rescaled covariant velocity perturbation , @xmath25 , for notational convenience , as    eq .
