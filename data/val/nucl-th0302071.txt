    "charged particle multiplicity densities near mid rapidity in high energy nuclear collisions depend strongly on collision centrality . in order to better understand this dependence and to disentangle pure nuclear effects ,",
    "this density is often plotted as per nucleon participant pair  @xcite .",
    "participants are the nucleons that have encountered at least one inelastic collision .",
    "the number of participants at a given centrality is usually calculated in the glauber model either analytically or with the help of a monte - carlo algorithm . the charged particle density per participant increases with centrality . in the 5% most central au+au collisions it is about 20% larger than that in semi - peripheral collisions ( 5070% centrality region ) , and it is about 50% larger compared to @xmath0 collisions at the same energy .",
    "the reason for this increase in number of produced particles per participant at midrapidity is still not well understood .",
    "the most common explanation of the phenomena involves particle production in hard processes .",
    "hard processes have much smaller cross - sections than soft collisions and depend differently on collision centrality .",
    "they scale with the number of binary collisions ( the number of collisions the incident nucleon would experience if it were not altered at all while passing through the nucleus ) .",
    "the number of binary collisions increases with centrality faster than the number of participants ; this results in an increase of particle production per participant nucleon as centrality increases . in",
    "such approaches the particle density is often presented simply as  @xcite : + ( 1- ) , where the parameter @xmath1 is the relative fraction of particles produced in the soft collisions , and @xmath2 is the relative fraction produced in hard collisions . with proper parameters ,",
    "this fits the data fairly well ; see ref .",
    "note , however , that in such models , the relative contribution of hard processes is expected to increase with the collision energy .",
    "the data seem inconsistent with such an energy dependence .    in the approach proposed in this paper ,",
    "both nuclei and single nucleons are considered as a superposition of constituent quarks ( also often called as `` dressed '' quarks or valons ) ; there are three such dressed quarks per nucleon .",
    "the concept of the constituent quarks has been known for many years ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the constituent quark approach is able to explain many features of hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus collisions  @xcite .",
    "qcd calculations support the statement that inside a nucleon there are three objects of the size of 0.1  0.3  fm ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) ; for some recent works using or discussing constituent quarks , see also refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the constituent quark picture , a @xmath3 collision looks like a collision of two light nuclei .",
    "most often only one @xmath4 pair interacts , with other quarks being _",
    "spectators_. only part of the entire nucleon energy is spent for particle production at midrapidity ( as @xmath5 ) .",
    "the quark spectators form hadrons in the nucleon fragmentation region . in the case of @xmath6 collisions , more than one quark per nucleon interacts due to the large nucleus size and the possibility for quarks from the same projectile nucleon to interact with different target nucleons .",
    "the goal of this study is to find the number of produced particles per participant quark ( pair ) and to check for its centrality dependence .",
    "we calculate mean number of nucleon / quark participants using a monte - carlo based implementation  @xcite of the nuclear overlap model @xcite .",
    "we use woods - saxon nuclear density profile n_a(r)= , with parameters : @xmath7    in the nuclear overlap model , the mean number of participants in @xmath8 collision at impact parameter @xmath9 is given by & & n_part , ab= d^2s t_a()\\{1- [ 1-]^b } + & & + d^2s t_b()\\{1- [ 1-]^a } , where @xmath10 is the thickness function ; then @xmath11 is the probability for a nucleon to pass through the nucleus without any collision .",
    "we use the inelastic @xmath3 cross section @xmath12  mb at @xmath13  gev .",
    "the number of participating nucleons for a given centrality can be determined directly using the web interface  @xcite . in order to calculate the number of participating quarks we downloaded fortran code and modified it by increasing the density three times ( @xmath14 ) and changing @xmath15 to @xmath16 . for the quark - quark cross - section in our calculation ,",
    "we use two values @xmath17  mb and a somewhat arbitrary value of @xmath18  mb ; the latter was used mostly to illustrate the sensitivity of the results to the value of @xmath16 .",
    "the choice of @xmath18  mb is not unreasonable since at rhic energies , approximately 1.2  1.3 quarks per nucleon can participate in a single @xmath3-collision  @xcite . in principle , @xmath16 could be probably as high as 8  mb based on the early estimates of @xmath19  @xcite .    fig .  [",
