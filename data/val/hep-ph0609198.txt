    "the possible occurrence of different phases in quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) at sufficiently high densities and small temperatures has attracted a lot of interest in recent years ( for corresponding reviews see _",
    "e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) . within models , and depending on various parameters and constraints , a surprisingly rich structure of different color - superconducting phases has been studied .",
    "the pairing pattern of quarks strongly depends on the relative position of the fermi surfaces of the different quark species .",
    "therefore the dynamically generated constituent masses as well as the effective chemical potentials are the relevant quantities for a study of color - flavor unlocking .    the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase is expected to be the ground state for a three flavor color - superconductor at asymptotically large densities  @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of what happens to this state when the density is lowered to more realistic values .",
    "since the cfl phase is neutral for degenerate quarks this depends mainly on the mass splitting between the strange quark and the two light ( up and down ) quarks .",
    "the unlocking of color and flavor has been investigated within models of the nambu & jona - lasinio ( njl ) type by varying the strange quark mass  @xcite .",
    "it has been concluded that at some densities the cfl phase is disfavored compared to the 2-flavor color superconductor ( 2sc ) phase in a self - consistent treatment  @xcite .",
    "the region of the 2sc phase possesses a rich ( sub-)structure if furthermore neutrality conditions and @xmath0-equilibrium are taken into account  @xcite . the cfl phase and the boundary for unlocking are , however , only mildly affected .",
    "these results , obtained in njl - type models , are rather sensitive to model parameters . for more reliable statements a non - perturbative approach , which is directly based on the qcd degrees of freedom and recovers the correct vacuum results as well as the proper weak coupling behavior at asymptotically large densities ,",
    "is needed .    for the description of qcd vacuum properties , truncated dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) in landau gauge",
    "have been successfully applied ( for corresponding reviews see refs .",
    "they naturally describe gluon @xcite as well as quark @xcite confinement .",
    "they have furthermore been extended to non - vanishing chemical potentials with the correct behavior in the weak coupling limit  @xcite . therefore this method will be employed here for the investigation of the color - flavor unlocking . within this framework",
    ", we present self - consistent solutions of the quark propagators in the 2sc and cfl phase for realistic values of the strange - quark current mass .",
    "we include energy- and momentum - dependent dressing functions for the most general parameterization in both dirac and color - flavor space .",
    "for the reasons stated above , we neglect for the time being the neutrality conditions in the present investigation of color - flavor unlocking .",
    "in contrast to studies employing njl - type models , we have also implemented a medium modification of the effective quark interaction taking into account the medium contribution to the polarization tensor which enters the gluon propagator .",
    "it has to be noted that a proper description of the weak coupling limit requires the inclusion of this effect .",
    "the vacuum part of the effective quark interaction is taken either from a solution of coupled gluon , ghost and quark propagator dses or from a fit to lattice data for the gluon and the quark propagators  @xcite .    in the chiral limit and at moderate values of the quark density , the gap functions at the fermi surface in such a calculation acquire sizeable values  @xcite , comparable to those obtained within njl - type models . these results are found to be rather insensitive to the effective quark interaction , at least within the range of uncertainty of the effective coupling .",
    "the dynamically generated mass functions , on the other hand , turn out to be significantly smaller than in the vacuum .",
    "this is due to the medium modification of the interaction ( which is usually neglected in njl - type investigations ) .",
    "this effect of smaller dynamical quark masses implies that the fermi surfaces of the quarks are closer to each other than expected and eventually leads to the most important result presented here : the cfl phase is , at zero temperature and realistic values for the strange quark current mass , always energetically preferred compared to the 2sc phase .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ setup ] we briefly present the employed theoretical framework , leading to a fully self - consistent treatment of the cfl phase for a range of strange quark masses . a physical interpretation of the parameterization used is provided . in section  [ results ]",
    "we discuss the numerical results including those for fermi momenta , mass and gap functions , etc .. most importantly , we provide a prediction for the critical value for the strange quark current mass as a function of the chemical potential .",
    "finally , we summarize and conclude in section  [ conclusions ] . the color - flavor basis employed is given in the appendix .",
    "@xcite , a closed truncated dse for the landau - gauge quark propagator at non - vanishing chemical potential has been derived and solved in the chiral limit . in this work we are following the scheme and notations presented there . in the nambu - gorkov basis",
    "( see ref.@xcite for a corresponding review ) the normal quark dse is coupled to an equation for the gap functions . to describe their structure",
    "we define @xmath1 with @xmath2 being the bare and @xmath3 the full nambu - gorkov propagator .",
    "@xmath4 is the nambu - gorkov self - energy .",
    "@xmath5 is diagonal in color - flavor space and equal to @xmath6 for a quark flavor @xmath7 .",
    "as the euclidean action is real we furthermore have to impose @xmath8 . introducing appropriate renormalization constants",
    ", the dse for the quark propagator @xmath9 explicitly leads to @xmath10 employing the truncation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the equations for the self - energy and the gap function then read @xmath11 where @xmath12 . here",
    "projectors transverse and longitudinal in the medium have been introduced . the functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 describe the corresponding medium modifications of the gluon propagator , see eq .",

    "e.g. _ the pressure difference between different phases at a given chemical potential .",
    "similar to our previous investigation in the chiral limit  @xcite , we employ two different couplings .",
    "the running coupling determined in dse studies of the yang - mills sector  @xcite , which is labeled in the following as @xmath17 , will serve as a lower bound .",
    "as is detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite it underestimates chiral symmetry breaking significantly in the abelian approximation , which on the other hand is an appropriate choice if the ground state does not break chiral symmetry dynamically or explicitly , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . the running coupling extracted from lattice qcd data for the quark and gluon propagators  @xcite will serve as an upper bound , since the medium will probably weaken the interaction .",
    "it is labeled @xmath18 . in order to vary the renormalization point in the latter version of the coupling",
    ", we use the multiplicative renormalizibility of the quark dse .",
    "note also that the vacuum quark propagator , determined within such a scheme  @xcite is in excellent agreement with the corresponding lattice data when the finite volume of lattice calculations is accounted for .    as stated above ,",
    "taking into account the medium polarization , debye screening and landau damping are included . both , screening and damping of the interaction increase for increasing interaction strength .",
    "therefore the generated gap and mass ( normal self - energy ) functions turn out to be much less sensitive against variation of @xmath15 than the dynamical mass function in the chirally broken vacuum . due to this fortunate instance",
    "the presented approach has considerable predictive power despite the uncertainty in the effective low - energy quark interaction at non - vanishing densities .",
    "the renormalization constants are determined in the ( chirally broken ) vacuum . due to the employed vertex construction",
    ", the quark - gluon vertex renormalization constant , @xmath19 , cancels in the resulting renormalized equations . for each flavor",
    ", we determine the quark wave - function renormalization constant , @xmath20 , and the renormalization constant @xmath21 , relating the unrenormalized quark mass @xmath22 at an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath23 to the renormalized mass @xmath24 via @xmath25 by requiring @xmath26 at a renormalization scale @xmath27 .",
    "this corresponds to a momentum - subtraction ( @xmath28 ) scheme , which results in somewhat smaller numerical values for the quark current masses at a given renormalization scale ( usually taken to be @xmath29 ) .",
    "we simply ignore here the difference between @xmath30 and @xmath28 masses because the effect is of the order of ten percent ( when calculated within perturbation theory ) and thus much smaller than the uncertainty in the value the current masses   scheme favor small values for the physical strange quark - current mass  @xcite , a fact which is definitely related to the difference in renormalization schemes . ] .",
    "it turns out that , as expected , the mass dependence of the quark wave function renormalization constant , @xmath20 , is negligible as long as the renormalization scale is much larger than the mass .",
    "therefore , we simply drop this dependence and @xmath20 is determined once and for all in the chiral limit . to keep the number of parameters as small as possible",
    ", we work in the chiral isospin limit ( _ i.e. _ we set the up and down current quark masses to zero ) and vary only the strange quark current mass .    in the following",
    "we will restrict to isotropic phases . in order to solve the dse of the quark propagator",
    "it is advantageous to consider their color - flavor structure first . to get a self - consistent solution we choose suitable sets of matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 in color - flavor space , such that @xmath33 where we have introduced the renormalization - point independent component functions @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are matrix - valued in dirac space .",
    "full self - consistency is guaranteed in case a basis of all allowed matrices is considered .",
    "the dimensionality of this basis in a given phase depends on the residual symmetry in color - flavor space . for the cfl phase this",
    "will be detailed below .",
    "the dirac structure of the self - energies in an even - parity phase can be parameterized by  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we already note that @xmath41 turns out to be negligibly small .",
    "this is to be expected since it has to vanish due to time reversal symmetry at vanishing temperatures in color - flavor symmetric channels .",
    "the gap functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 , which vanish in the chiral limit will be discussed in subsection [ gapinter ] where we provide an interpretation in a simplified setting .",
    "the system of equations for the self - energies is symmetric under the transformations @xmath44 which we find to be unbroken in the self - consistent scheme presented here .",
    "therefore , the determinant of the quark propagator is positive for @xmath45 , and the luttinger theorem is applicable for determining the density  @xcite .    for the anomalous propagator an inhomogeneous part is missing in eq.([fullt ] ) .",
    "therefore we can choose a global phase for the gap functions .",
    "this is done such that the equations are invariant under @xmath46 and therefore @xmath47 and @xmath43 are real , and @xmath42 and @xmath48 purely imaginary , for @xmath45 .",
    "neglecting @xmath49 , the dirac structure of the inverse normal propagator can be written as @xmath50 which allows to define the mass function for the pairing quasiparticles for a given color - flavor channel @xmath51 as @xmath52 in the following we will mostly present results for mass functions at @xmath45 . to ease notations we will use @xmath53 except when stated explicitly otherwise .      as its name already expresses ,",
    "the cfl phase is defined via its symmetry pattern in color - flavor space . for three degenerate quark flavors ,",
    "one considers the @xmath54 symmetry generated by @xmath55 , with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 being the gell - mann matrices in flavor and color space , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the quarks therefore are in a @xmath59 representation of this symmetry . in the case of only two degenerate quarks and a strange quark , the symmetry is broken down to @xmath60 , which is generated by @xmath55 with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , _ i.e. _ the quarks form a @xmath63 representation .    for the nambu - gorkov propagator to be invariant under this transformation , we need to require @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "the matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , needed for a self - consistent description are then those given explicitely in the appendix .    in section  [ results ] we will also present results for the self - energies evaluated at different energies and momenta , in particular at the fermi surface .",
    "in contrast to the chiral limit , where the matrices @xmath31 can be chosen as constant projectors onto irreducible representations of the residual symmetry , the situation is more complex here . in principle , every dressing function of the normal propagator and self - energy can be decomposed into irreducible projectors in color - flavor space : @xmath66 where , in particular , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "however , for every dressing function , the singlets are not protected against mixing and therefore their projectors @xmath70 and @xmath71 are in general energy and momentum dependent .",
    "we therefore find six different fermi momenta , which are defined as sign changes of the determinant of the propagator , @xmath72 , at @xmath45 and connected to the density by the luttinger theorem .",
    "three of them correspond to the upper @xmath73 block - matrix in the ansatz employed ( see appendix ) and describe the mixing of the two singlet channels as well as the triplet channel . after ordering ,",
    "these are denoted by @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 . in the lower @xmath77 diagonal block - matrix ,",
    "we find @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .    for the dressing functions of the anomal propagators and the gap functions the situation is similar . with @xmath84 being invertible and fulfilling @xmath85 , we define @xmath86 .",
    "every dressing function can then be written as @xmath87 where @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore @xmath91 and @xmath92 are again in general energy and momentum dependent due to the possible mixing between the singlets .",
    "having introduced the most general dirac structure for the gap functions in an even - parity phase ( see eq.([phi ] ) ) their interpretation and in particular their relation to the energy gap in the excitation spectrum is of interest . to this end",
    "one has to determine the dispersion relations as given by the poles of the propagators .",
    "this is a solvable task but leads already for degenerate quarks and constant dressing functions to very involved and intricate expressions .",
    "a physically motivated approximation with a simple interpretation of the gap function will be introduced in this subsection and will serve as an illustration .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the pairing of only two different quasiparticles @xmath93 and @xmath94 with inverse propagators in dirac space , given by @xmath95 for vanishing gap functions .",
    "this is in particular the case for the three lower @xmath96 block - matrices in the ansatz presented in the appendix .",
    "the gapped propagator @xmath97 in one channel , see eq .",
    "( [ fulls ] ) , is then typically given by @xmath98 with @xmath99 of the form in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) .",
    "the propagators , being of the form in eq .",
    "( [ inversesp ] ) , can be expressed via the energy - projectors for @xmath100 @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . neglecting the @xmath106-dependence in the dressing - functions and absorbing @xmath107 and @xmath108 by rescaling @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 correspondingly  , formally leading to two chemical potentials .",
    "this introduces no further complication in principle but is neglected for the sake of simplicity .",
    "] , we assume that no pairing between quasiparticles and anti - quasiparticles takes place .",
    "this reduces eq.([phiinterfulls ] ) to @xmath112 which is exact in the chiral limit .",
    "note , that it can also be justified , at least in leading order , in a @xmath113 expansion .",
    "evaluating the roots of the right - hand side , we find the dispersion relation @xmath114 where we have made use of the fact that @xmath47 and @xmath43 are real and @xmath42 and @xmath48 are imaginary at @xmath45 ( see the discussion in the last subsection ) .",
    "noting that @xmath115 , the above expression suggests to introduce gap functions , which are transformed accordingly : @xmath116 this transformation depends on the mass parameter of the quasiparticle , which makes evident that the existence of the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 allows different energy gaps for quasiparticles with different masses . in terms of the  rotated  gap functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 we obtain @xmath119 in analogy to the situation in the chiral limit , we arrive now at a simple interpretation : one has a chirally symmetric pairing via @xmath120 and a chirality breaking pairing through @xmath121 . for anti - quasiparticle pairing @xmath117 and @xmath118 simply change sign . in the chiral limit",
    "we then find , as expected , @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "as described above , the quark propagator is highly non - trivial . the dirac structure of the self - energies and gap functions",
    "is given by four self - consistently determined functions , respectively , which are in addition functions of @xmath124 and @xmath106 .",
    "in accordance with the aim of this paper , namely to investigate the phenomenological importance of the strange quark current mass , we mainly restrict ourself to the presentation of results at @xmath45 and some values of @xmath124 .",
    "this will also turn out to be sufficient to demonstrate the important differences of our results as compared to corresponding ones obtained in njl - type models . as already mentioned",
    ", we include self - energy effects , which have been analyzed so far only in the weak coupling regime  @xcite .",

    "we like to emphasize that we are no longer able to find a solution for the cfl phase in case the 2sc phase becomes favored .",
    "this is considered as a consequence of the numerical method to solve the truncated dse being the functional derivative of the truncated cjt action .",
    "it turns out that we always only find the global minimum of the cjt action as long as the local minimum is not protected by a higher symmetry .",
    "the latter is the case for the 2sc phase , if the cfl one is preferred .",
    "nevertheless we can judge from the behavior of the gap functions that the transition is first order .     and @xmath18 and the range stated by the particle data group  @xcite ( shaded band ) . , width=377 ]    in fig .",
    "[ mscritfig ] the results for the critical value of the renormalized strange - quark mass as a function of the chemical potential are given and compared to the range of the physical strange - quark current mass as determined by the particle data group  @xcite .",
    "( as stated above , the difference between this mass in the @xmath28 and the @xmath30 regularization scheme is negligible compared to the experimental uncertainty . ) as can be seen , the approach taken here predicts that the physical strange - quark current mass is very likely too small for allowing a 2sc phase at zero temperature for any chemical potential .",
    "this result is remarkably stable against the variation of the running coupling @xmath15 .",
    "we have studied the quark propagator in the 2sc and cfl phase at zero temperature for different values of the strange - quark current mass in a fully self - consistent dyson - schwinger approach to color - superconductivity . due to the medium modification of the interaction",
    "we find the 2sc phase to be disfavored at any physically relevant chemical potential for the physical value of the strange - quark current mass .",
    "this result is robust against variation of the running of the strong coupling in the infrared within the given uncertainties .",
    "since the cfl phase is only mildly influenced by neutrality conditions we expect the result to hold even when neutrality is required .",
    "the critical value of the strange - quark current mass should then be similar or even slightly larger .",
    "this will be explored in further studies .",
    "given the present results a further investigation of the cfl phase by the inclusion of the meissner effect and goldstone - boson contributions is of interest since both are expected to decrease the gap functions . also the temperature dependence and therefore the structure of the qcd phase diagram at large densities",
    "is within the reach of the type of investigations presented here .",
    "we thank michael buballa and dirk rischke for helpful discussions , and michael buballa for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
    "d.n .  is grateful to the daad for a fellowship , and to the members of the fwf - funded doctoral program `` hadrons in vacuum , nuclei and stars '' at the institute of physics of the university of graz , where part of the work has been done , for their hospitality .",
    "in addition , this work has been furthermore supported in part by the helmholtz association ( virtual theory institute vh - vi-041 ) and by the bmbf under grant number 06da916 .",
    "we generalize the ansatz for the cfl phase with two degenerate quarks as given in  @xcite by choosing the matrices @xmath150 which fulfill the requirements of eq .",
