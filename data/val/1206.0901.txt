    "despite the outstanding understand of the structure of matter at energy density much larger than the critical value which defines the hadron - quark deconfinement phase transition , one of the yet - unsettled problems of theoretical physics is the characterization of equation(s ) of state ( eos ) describing the behaviour of thermodynamic quantities at finite temperatures and densities . on one hand ,",
    "the lattice qcd calculations are reliable , especially at very high temperatures and densities . on the other hand ,",
    "the exact equation of state of the hadronic matter is still rather complicated . in describing the ground state properties of nuclear matter having a large number of finite nuclei ,",
    "the hartree - fock theories using skyrme effective interactions are shown to be quite successful @xcite . nevertheless , as concluded in @xcite",
    ", it seems that serious concerns about basic physical symmetries arise when using eos derived from skyrme interactions in framework of hartree - fock theories , especially at finite temperatures .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the speed of sound seems to violate the causality constrains leading to superluminal phenomena .",
    "regardless these difficulties in suggesting a reliable eos for the nuclear ground state , the speed of sound is widely considered as an order parameter for the critical behavior in the strongly interacting matter .",
    "early lattice qcd calculations @xcite have shown that the speed of sound possesses a _ sharp dip _ over the critical region , where the deconfinement phase transition is believed to take place through a slow crossover .",
    "such a dip becomes weak with refining the certainty of the lattice qcd calculations @xcite , which is based on extreme enriching the computing facilities and utilizing powerful algorithms .",
    "various reasons speak for utilizing the physical resonance gas model ( hrg ) in predicting the hadron abundances and their thermodynamics .",
    "this model seems to provide a good description for the thermal evolution of the thermodynamic quantities in the hadronic matter  @xcite and has been successfully utilized to characterize the conditions deriving the chemical freeze - out at finite densities  @xcite . in light of this",
    ", hrg can be used in calculating the speed of sound using a grand canonical partition function of an ideal gas with all experimentally observed states up to a certain large mass as constituents .",
    "the hrg grand canonical ensemble includes two important features @xcite ; the kinetic energies and the summation over all degrees of freedom and energies of resonances . on other hand",
    ", it is known that the formation of resonances can only be achieved through strong interactions  @xcite ; _ resonances ( fireballs ) are composed of further resonances ( fireballs ) , which in turn consist of resonances ( fireballs ) and so on_. in other words , the contributions of the hadron resonances to the partition function are the same as that of free particles with some effective mass . at temperatures comparable to the resonance half - width , the effective mass approaches the physical one @xcite .",
    "thus , at high temperatures , the strong interactions are conjectured to be taken into consideration through including heavy resonances .",
    "it is found that hadron resonances with masses up to @xmath6gev are representing suitable constituents for the partition function  @xcite .",
    "such a way , the singularity expected at the hagedorn temperature  @xcite can be avoided and the strong interactions are assumed to be considered .",
    "nevertheless , the validity of hrg is limited to temperatures below the critical one , @xmath2 .",
    "recently , the problematic of characterizing a hadronic equation of state has been discussed in @xcite . in an ideal gas of hadron resonances with hagedorn mass spectrum",
    ", the speed of sound is calculated at different upper cut - off masses in the resonance mass integration .",
    "it is found that the speed of sound initially increases similarly to that of an ideal pion gas , until near @xmath2 .",
    "then , the hadron resonance effects seem to become dominant .",
    "this causes a vanishing speed of sound at @xmath7 .    in present work ,",
    "we introduce a systematic study for the squared speed of sound based on hrg  @xcite .",
    "we fix cut - off resonance masses to @xmath8gev .",
    "we distinguish between the bosonic and fermionic contributions to the thermodynamics .",
    "also , we distinguish between the contributions stemming from the pion gas and that from a gas consisting of all resonances with and without pions . finally , we compare the results with recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the causal aspects of the speed of sound are introduced in section [ sec : mdl ] . in a grand canonical ensemble , the thermal and dense evolution based on hrg calculations",
    "is derived .",
    "the hrg results and their comparison with full lattice qcd are given in section [ sec : rsl ] .",
    "section [ sec : conl ] is devoted to the conclusions and outlook .",
    "in the context of special or general relativity , the _ barotropic _ equation of state of a perfect fluid in the physical units simply reads @xcite ( sf . eq .",
    "( [ eq : cs24 ] ) ) [ eq : eos1 ] p & = & , where the pressure @xmath9 is proportional to the energy density @xmath10 through the quantity @xmath11 .",
    "this proportionality can be very well determined in hadronic matter and quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "furthermore , it can be determined over the hadron - quark phase confinement - deconfinement transition , where barotropic dependence of the pressure is to be deduced from the lattice qcd simulations @xcite .",
    "figure [ afig1a ] depicts it in a wide range of temperatures , @xmath12 .",
    "it is obvious that the dependence is almost linear referring to the nature of the phase transition from hadrons to quarks .",
    "this phase transition seems to be smooth i.e. , simply continuous and takes place over a considerable range of temperature , i.e. , it is slow .",
    "this kind of transitions is a very moderate than the second - order one , for instance .",

    "i.e. , at temperatures @xmath17 , the previous power law dependence seems to remain valid .",
    "considerable changes appear in the parameters ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 . in the quark phase",
    "i.e. , at temperatures @xmath20 , the following polynomial @xmath21 describes this barotropic dependence , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the squared speed of sound can be related to causality constrains @xcite [ eq : cs24 ] & = & = , and therefore @xmath24 can not exceed the speed of light @xmath25 . seeking for completeness , the propagation can be superluminal if the fluid s stress tensor violates the lorentz invariant principle @xcite . the possibility of @xmath26 in _ unquantized _ ultradense matter has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this might be the case of certain values for the cosmological constant , for instance , @xcite .",
    "apparently , expressions ( [ aeq : p1 ] ) and ( [ aeq : p2 ] ) imply that @xmath0 drastically changes according to the changes in the phases :    * in hadron - quark phase : @xmath27 i.e. , the speed of sound varies with the thermal evolution of the energy density .",
    "the latter has a non - monotonic behavior , when going from hadronic to partonic phases and vice versa .",
    "this can be seen when comparing * the hadronic phase , where @xmath28 , with * the partonic phase , where @xmath29 .    there is a drastic change in the value of @xmath0 , when passing through the hadron - quark phase transition .    in light of this discussion , it turns to be clear that the speed of sound seems to offer an essential tool to check the causality and therefore the applicability of the laws of thermodynamics , on one hand . on other hand ,",
    "the effective equation of state of the system of interest is directly accessible through the speed of sound .",
    "furthermore , it would be used as an order parameter .",
    "the hadron resonances treated as a free gas  @xcite are conjectured to add to the thermodynamic pressure in the hadronic phase , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "this statement is valid for free as well as strong interactions between the resonances themselves .",
    "it has been shown that the thermodynamics of strongly interacting system can also be approximated to an ideal gas composed of hadron resonances with masses @xmath30gev  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the confined phase of qcd , the hadronic phase , would be modelled as a non - interacting gas of hadron resonances .",
    "the grand canonical partition function reads z(t , v ) & = &    where @xmath31 is the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by the sum of the kinetic energies of relativistic fermi and bose particles .",
    "the main motivation of using this hamiltonian is that it contains all relevant degrees of freedom of confined and strongly interacting matter .",
    "it includes implicitly the interactions that result in resonance formation .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that this model can submit a quite satisfactory description of the particle production in heavy - ion collisions . with the above assumptions the dynamics of the partition function",
    "can be calculated exactly and be expressed as a sum over _ single - particle partition _",

    ", it was speculated about a possible phase transition of a massless pion gas to a new phase of matter .",
    "based on statistical models like hagedorn @xcite and bootstrap @xcite , the thermodynamics of such an ideal pion gas is studied , extensively . after the qcd , the new phase of matter is known as qgp .",
    "the physical picture was that at @xmath2 the additional degrees of freedom carried by qgp are to be released resulting in an increase in the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the success of hrg in reproducing lattice qcd results at various quark flavours and masses ( below @xmath2 ) changed this physical picture , drastically . instead of releasing additional degrees of freedom at @xmath37 , it is found that the interacting system reduces its effective degrees of freedom at @xmath38 . in other words ,",

    "furthermore , this might interpret the results given in section [ sec : rsl ] , for instance , it would explain why the qcd barotropic pressure , the equation of state , is well reproduced by hrg , while @xmath0 is not .",

    "we find remarkable differences between bosons and fermions , between strange and non - strange hadron resonances and between the expressions ( [ eq : cs2a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cs2a2 ] ) .",

    "the latter decreases faster than the increase taking place in the earlier .",
    "the expressions ( [ eq : cs2a1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cs2a2 ] ) are obviously distinguishable , especially for bosons at the intermediate temperatures . including strange hadron resonances increases the fermionic @xmath0 , on one hand . on the other hand",

    "therefore , the in / exclusion of strange resonances obviously changes the number of hadron resonances which are considered in the partition function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lnz1 ] ) .",
    "it is expected that the values of the thermodynamic quantities are considerably suppressed when adding new hadron resonances , i.e. , additional masses , to the partition function .",
    "apparently , this is not exactly the case with @xmath0 .",

    "<S> the equation of state and squared speed of sound @xmath0 are studied in grand canonical ensemble of all hadron resonances having masses @xmath1gev . </S>",

    "<S> the comparison of the barotropic dependence of the pressure calculated in the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) with that of full lattice qcd at vanishing and finite chemical potential is excellent . nevertheless , the comparison of @xmath0 at vanishing chemical potential is not that good . </S>",
    "<S> but , when switching on the chemical potential , hrg @xmath0 and that of full lattice qcd are in good agreement , especially when @xmath0 is calculated through the ratio @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 being entropy and specific heat , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> such a discrepancy in reproducing the equation of state , but not the speed of sound can be understood as the specific heat reflects several types of energy susceptibilities and fluctuations . </S>",
