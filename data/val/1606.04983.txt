    "the _ self - similar _ model predicts simple scaling relations between cluster observables and their mass @xcite .",

    "x - ray properties are also related to the cluster mass and gas temperature @xcite .",
    "scaling relations have been determined observationally but their form does not necessarily coincide with the prediction of the self - similar model @xcite .",
    "therefore , non - gravitational processes such as mergers , cooling and energy injection from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have a significant contribution to the equilibrium state of clusters and scaling relations can be used to test the physics of clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the redshift evolution of the scaling relations seems to follow the self - similar prediction @xcite , suggesting that cluster properties evolve with the density of the universe .",
    "large - scale surveys of the tsz effect such as those carried out by the atacama cosmology telescope ( act , @xcite ) the south pole telescope ( spt , @xcite ) and the _ planck _ satellite @xcite have helped to constrain cosmological parameters using sz clusters @xcite and to establish scaling relations between x - ray magnitudes and tsz measurements @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of clusters as cosmological probes depends on obtaining reliable mass estimates . in this respect ,",
    "the scatter on the scaling relations needs to be understood in order to account for observational biases .",
    "the scatter includes statistical errors , systematic biases and the intrinsic differences between clusters .",
    "the intrinsic scatter is dominated by the cluster cores @xcite since _ cool - core _ ( cc ) clusters deviate from self - similarity of the _ no cool - core _ ( ncc ) population .",
    "the difference in the cluster population have been thought to be responsible for discrepancies between numerical predictions and observations .",
    "@xcite found that the universal pressure profile @xcite overestimated the tsz amplitude by a 30% .",
    "since the universal pressure profile agreed with tsz data for cc but disagreed for the ncc clusters , it was thought that the excess was related to the dynamical state of the icm .",
    "nevertheless , subsequent analysis did not find any evidence of this discrepancy @xcite .",
    "this was further confirmed by the planck collaboration using a sample of @xmath8 clusters @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the tsz anisotropy was individually measured for each object but , in order to maximize the statistical significance of the result , the signal was averaged in bins of x - ray luminosity .",

    "for comparison we use a maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) introduced by @xcite that also accounts for correlated errors in both variables and their intrinsic scatter .",
    "we computed the regression coefficients using both methods and found the results to be in excellent agreement .",
    "the mle performs marginally better than bces when the measurement errors and the intrinsic scatter are large .",
    "then , we will quote only the results estimated using the mle technique .    when fitting a scaling relation , it is important to distinguish between the _ raw _ scatter , @xmath13 , the dispersion around the best fit model , and the _ intrinsic _ scatter , @xmath14 , due to the differences on physical properties of clusters .",
    "the former is computed as the error weighted residual @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of clusters and the weights are given by @xmath17 while @xmath18 is the difference between the ` raw ' scatter and the statistical uncertainty ( @xmath19 ) obtained by propagating the error on the measured quantities .",
    "a simple estimator of the intrinsic error is given by adding in quadrature uniform values to the measured uncertainties of each individual cluster and finding the value for which @xmath20 per degree of freedom is equal to unity , i.e. , @xmath21 ( @xcite ) .",

    "we estimated @xmath0 using both sets of parameters , denoted by subindices a and p , respectively , and we take this uncertainty to be the absolute value of their difference : @xmath28 . to estimate the errors on magnitudes derived from scaling relations we generated 10,000 realizations of @xmath23 and @xmath25 for each cluster , assuming that the errors on the parameters of their respective scaling relations were gaussian distributed . on average , the relative error on @xmath23 was found to be @xmath29 , while in @xmath25 was @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding error on @xmath26 is @xmath31 . since @xmath27 contributes to the total relative error budget with less than @xmath32 ,",
    "the final error on the universal profiles was dominated by the uncertainty on the mass estimates .",
    "selection biases affect x - ray flux limited samples in two ways : malmquist bias , due to higher luminosity clusters being preferentially selected out to higher redshifts and eddington bias , due objects above the flux limit having above average luminosities for their mass as a result of the intrinsic or statistical scatter in their luminosity for any given mass . scaling relations need to be corrected from these effects @xcite .",

    "this confirms the trend found by @xcite with a much smaller sample : the more massive systems had a shallower slope and could be an indication that the @xmath6 relation is gradually steepening when moving toward the low - mass objects suggesting that a simple power law can not be used to convert the measured luminosities into masses .",

    "unfortunately , our redshift bins contain few clusters and the error bars on the measured values are consequently large so no statistical analysis could be made .",

    "our value is not directly comparable to @xmath123 found by @xcite using 94 clusters in the range @xmath124 since magnitudes were evaluated at @xmath45 . in @xcite a similar analysis was carried out using a catalog of @xmath8 clusters up to redshift @xmath125 . for this sample ,",
    "the measured value was @xmath126 .",

    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] .",
    "like before , we found no indication of redshift evolution , confirming the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , we have to consider that our redshift range could be too small to be sensitive to any hypothetical evolution .",
    "for instance , @xcite used a sample of 115 clusters at redshifts @xmath127 to carry out his analysis .",
    "computing the cluster mass from a @xmath128 relation and using a universal gas to dark matter fraction , he estimated the comptonization parameter for each cluster and determined the @xmath129 relation for different apertures . since @xmath130 was not measured from cmb temperature anisotropy maps , his results are not directly comparable with ours .",
    "nevertheless , he systematically finds the exponent to be @xmath131 .",
    "since his cluster sample extends to a greater redshift range than the one used here , it would be interesting to test if his results , when compared to ours , are an indication of the time evolution of the scaling parameters .",
    "we have fitted scaling relations between the comptonization parameter predicted using x - ray data and the measured x - ray luminosity with the one measured from foreground cleaned _ planck _ 2013 nominal maps using a sample of 560 x - ray selected clusters .",
    "prediction and measurement are compared at two angular scales , @xmath43 that correspond to the region that emits 99% of the x - ray flux and @xmath45 , the scale at which the cluster density is 500 times the critical density .",
    "our catalog contains cluster and rich groups with masses @xmath132 , one order of magnitude below the mass range explored by the planck collaboration .",
    "we found that the comptonization parameter @xmath0 predicted using the @xmath5 model agrees with the measured value within @xmath43 but overestimates it at @xmath45 indicating that clusters are not isothermal .",
    "we also show that the universal profile with either @xcite or @xcite parameters overestimates the sz anisotropy .",
    "averaged over our cluster sample , we find an excess ranging from 15% to 21% depending on the aperture and the set of parameters used .",
    "this is slightly lower than the 30% required to explain the tsz power determined by wmap @xcite .",
    "we verified that the discrepancy is not due to the presence of cc clusters .",
    "the discrepancy is greatly reduced if the analysis is restricted to clusters with @xmath133 , suggesting that the low and high mass systems are not well described by a universal pressure profile with the same set of parameters , an indication that the dynamical evolution of baryons in low and high mass systems was different .",
    "this conclusion supports the @xcite suggestion of a brake in the @xmath6 relation after correcting for selection biases .",
    "then a simple power law can not be used to describe both clusters and groups and to translate x - ray luminosities into masses .",
    "finally , we have also shown that the relation of the comptonization parameter averaged over the region that emits 99% of the x - ray flux and the x - ray luminosity are consistent with the prediction of the self - similar model .",
    "we found that the scaling relation @xmath47 is consistent with the self - similar model described in sec .",
    "[ sec : regression ] .",
    "if the temperature scales with mass as in the self - similar model ( @xmath119 ) then deviations of the scaling of the gas mass with the total mass are compatible with zero ( @xmath134 ) and is in tension with the value of @xmath123 measured by @xcite , although the two results are not directly comparable since @xmath135 was determined from scaling relations measured at different apertures .",
    "we tested the redshift evolution by dividing the catalog in five redshift subsamples .",
    "we found no evidence of evolution within @xmath136 in the two scaling relations analyzed .",
    "a comparison with the earlier results of @xcite is not straightforward since this author did not obtain @xmath2 from cmb data but used scaling relations .",
    "his sample of 115 clusters includes systems with @xmath127 and he finds the exponent to be @xmath131 , depending on the angular scale used .",
