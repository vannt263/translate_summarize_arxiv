    "though the theoretical study of two - dimensional carbon has a long history @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite only after experimental evidence of existence of graphene as a stable two - dimensional crystal @xcite , @xcite this material became very popular .",
    "the presence of zero gap and zero electron mass , combined with a rather high mobility at room temperature , makes graphene an unique material for various fundamental and applied problems . at present graphene",
    "is intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally ( see e.g. reviews @xcite ) .",
    "the study of graphene optics ( see @xcite,@xcite ) is stimulated by the prediction that the absorption in monolayer graphene should be determined by the fundamental constant @xmath5 @xcite , @xcite and its experimental evidence @xcite .",
    "the investigation of coupling between photons and electrons in graphene attracts now an active interest of the community ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "an observation of amplified stimulated terahertz emission from optically pumped epitaxial graphene heterostructures has been reported recently @xcite . however , the photoinduced currents , namely , photon drag and photogalvanic effects in graphene were beyond of interest of the researchers . in this paper we present the theoretical analysis of these effects .",
    "the study of light pressure on solids has rather long history .",
    "the simplest variant is an instantaneous transmission of photon momentum to electrons .",
    "this process is permitted for interband transitions or in presence of the  third body  , for example , phonons , other electrons , impurities . for a free particle",
    "this process is forbidden by conservation laws .",
    "small value of the photon momentum makes nonresonant photon drag effect ( nde ) extremely weak .    at the same time there exists a less known variant of this effect ,",
    "namely resonant photon drag effect ( rde ) which has no weakness of usual nde @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "resonance drag occurs when some partial kinetic property of electron gas sharply depends on electron energy .",
    "a small photon momentum gives an increase of the electron energy , that can drastically change the relaxation time .",
    "this leads to a significantly different contributions to the electron current for electrons exited along or oppositely to the photon direction . in @xcite the situation was studied for interband transitions in weakly doped gaas when the electron energy approaches the energy of longitudinal optical phonon . in this case",
    "electrons exited along the direction of photon have larger energy than electrons in opposite direction .",
    "hence , their energy can exceed the threshold for emission of optical phonon : they quickly emit phonons and stop , while the opposite electrons will move freely till they collide with impurity .",
    "this gives rise to the appearance of charge flow in the direction opposite to the light ray .",
    "here we develop another idea for rde based on a sharp fermi distribution which forbids the transitions below the fermi energy @xmath6 .",
    "this idea is illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "electrons are excited from the hole cone to the electron cone by photons with frequency @xmath2 and wave vector @xmath7 .",
    "the conditions for resonant transitions are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the electron momentum counted from the cone point , @xmath11cm / s is the electron velocity , and @xmath0 is a projection of the wave vector @xmath7 of radiation to the plane of graphene .",
    "the first condition determines ellipse in @xmath10 plane , the second limits a part of this ellipse accessible for transitions .",
    "the wave vector tilts the transitions towards its direction .",
    "1 shows the case when the frequency is close to @xmath12 .",
    "the electrons in the figure are excited from the right segment of the fermi surface contour .",
    "this results in electron flow rightwards . since @xmath13 the rde appears when the frequency is close to @xmath12 , namely if @xmath14 . inside this window the current of rde",
    "has no smallness connected with @xmath1 and can be estimated as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath4 are the electron charge and the velocity , @xmath17 is the opacity of graphene , @xmath18 is the transport relaxation time and @xmath19 is the light intensity .",
    "physical meaning of this estimation is evident : @xmath20 is the instantaneous density of exited electrons which conserve their momentum .",
    "being multiplied by the current of individual electrons @xmath21 , this quantity gives the current density .",
    "below we determine both nde and rde for interband transitions in monolayer graphene with degenerate electron gas .",
    "due to graphene electron - hole symmetry results are applicable to n- and p - type graphene .",
    "in general the relaxation process for electrons and holes are different that breaks electron - hole symmetry . for concreteness",
    ", we consider the n - type graphene . in this case",
    "the mean free time of excited electrons is much longer than that of holes since due to different distance from the fermi level holes can easier emit phonons .",
    "thus , the contribution of holes will be neglected .",
    "space by the photon wave vector @xmath22 .",
    "the transitions are permitted only above the fermi level .",
    "right panel : projection to the momentum plane . filled circle represents the fermi sea , the elliptic curve corresponds to the energy conservation equation @xmath23 ; only momenta outside the fermi circle are permitted corresponding to the right segment of the elliptic curve . ,",

    "2 illustrates a possible experiment on excitation of the drag current in a suspended graphene sheet placed in @xmath24 plane .",
    "light with frequency @xmath2 , wave vector @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and amplitude of electric field @xmath27 illuminates graphene plane .",
    "we consider transitions near the cone singularity . in this case the current is determined by the projections of the electric field and the wave vector onto the graphene layer .",
    ", where @xmath28 is the vertical distance between dangling bonds of neighboring atoms .",
    "in fact , this component results in the dynamical splitting of these states and can be included in the hamiltonian as @xmath29 .",
    "comparison of this term with considered one gives foregoing estimate .",
    "] these quantities are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the angle of incidence , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are amplitude components of the electric field @xmath27 perpendicular and parallel to the incident plane .",
    "we ignore small modification of field caused by the layer .",
    "the current of photon drag effect can be expressed via the probability of transition @xmath35 from the hole state with a momentum @xmath36 to the electron state with momentum @xmath10 and the electron velocity @xmath37 as @xmath38 where the coefficient 4 accounts for the valley and spin degeneracies .",
    "the dependence on the photon momentum results from the momentum and energy conservation laws and the matrix elements for transition . for simplicity we put below @xmath39 .",
    "the two - band hamiltonian near the dirac point is @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the vector of the pauli matrices . the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the polar angle of the vector @xmath10 .",
    "the different signs correspond to electrons and holes .",
    "the interaction with the wave is determined by the matrix elements of the velocity @xmath45 between the hole and electron states with the momenta @xmath36 and @xmath10 : @xmath46 , correspondingly .",
    "the transition probability @xmath35 is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the heaviside function .",
    "the expression for current eq.([j ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath49 where @xmath50 we utilized the symmetry of the tensor @xmath51 resulting to inclusion of the field polarization in the combinations @xmath52 only and independence on the degree of circular polarization .",
    "hence , without loss of generality one can consider the field as linear - polarized and @xmath53 as real .    due to the smallness of the wave vector @xmath1 , as compared to the electron momentum , one can expand all quantities in powers of @xmath1 .",
    "expanding by @xmath1 we can write the argument of the delta - function as @xmath54 ( we choose the direction of axis x along @xmath0 ) . at the same time , @xmath1 is comparable with @xmath55 and we keep ourselves from subsequent expansion of the delta - function .      if @xmath18 is independent on the energy of electrons then the integration in eq.([jjj ] ) can be done directly .",
    "the current has different values inside and outside the region @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath14 then we have @xmath59 these values represent resonant photon drag rde .",
    "it remains constant if @xmath60 .",
    "the value of resonant current is determined by @xmath61 . for the photon flow @xmath62@xmath63s@xmath64 ,",
    "@xmath65 s , @xmath66a / cm .",
    "this approximately corresponds to a power of @xmath67 for photons with energy @xmath68 .",
    "if @xmath69 , then there is only nde current .",
    "it is proportional to @xmath1 : @xmath70 the value of nde is significantly smaller then the rde value .    in agreement with the simple estimates",
    "the rde has always the direction opposite to the direction of light wave vector .",
    "its polarization dependence is explained by the dependence of the directional diagram of excitation : most of carriers are excited perpendicular to the polarization . at the same time",
    "the fermi sea limits the transitions by the direction of the photon wave vector .",
    "this circumstances together determine lower x - component of current if @xmath71 in comparison with the case @xmath72 and also the appearance of y - component of the rde current .    in agreement with the system symmetry",
    ", @xmath73 exists only if the polarization has both @xmath74 and @xmath75 components .",
    "the rde current exists in a narrow window @xmath14 which shrinks if @xmath60 .",
    "but inside this window rde is much stronger than nde so the later can be neglected in this window .     versus normalized frequency @xmath76 .",
    "the solid curve shows the longitudinal component of current @xmath77 , the field is polarized along the projection of the wave vector on the plane ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath73 at @xmath79 .",
    "the dashed curve shows @xmath77 at @xmath80 .",
    ", width=283 ]    ; @xmath77 is shown by dash curve , @xmath73 is shown by solid curve.,width=283 ]    the sign of x - component of nde depends on polarization .",
    "this contradicts to a simple assumption according to which the current is mainly determined by kicks which photons give to electrons . the origin of this difference is the dependence of the directional diagram on the small wave vector @xmath0 via the parameter @xmath51 : at some polarizations electrons prefer to be excited in opposite direction to @xmath0 .",
    "this explains the change of sign .",
    "3 demonstrates the dependence of rde current components on the frequency in the window @xmath14 where rde exists .",
    "the current vanishes at the edges of the window .",
    "the component @xmath77 is larger for the polarization along the y axis .",
    "the component @xmath73 appears only for tilted polarization of the light .",
    "4 shows the dependence of @xmath77 and @xmath73 on the angle @xmath81 between the vector of polarization @xmath53 and the wave vector @xmath0 .",
    "we have studied the electron contribution to the photon drag current . in fact",
    ", in the considered system the hole contribution also presents .",
    "the symmetry between holes and electrons in a neutral system means that these contributions double .",
    "however , the result will be changed if to take into account the difference between electrons and holes caused by their different excitation energy : while electrons are generated near the fermi energy the holes appear well below the fermi energy .",
    "this leads to a strong difference between the relaxation times . in high - mobility samples at low temperature the momentum relaxation time near",
    "the fermi energy is much greater than far from the fermi energy . at the same time , quick relaxation of excited electrons ( holes ) to the fermi energy due to electron - electron interaction ( described by e - e relaxation time @xmath82 ) conserves their momenta up to the moment when excitations reaches the temperature layer .",
    "this results in equality of holes and electrons contributions to the current . and vice versa",
    ", electron - phonon relaxation can cancel the hole contribution if @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the time of energy relaxation due to electron - phonon collisions .",
    "thus , the obtained current should be multiplied by a factor 2 in the case of quick e - e relaxation and be kept unchanged in the opposite case .",
    "we note , that when the fermi energy tends to zero the system becomes symmetric .",
    "the rde exists in a narrow energy range @xmath85 near the fermi energy .",
    "this means that the rde is visible for temperature @xmath86 . for photons with",
    "@xmath87 this gives @xmath88 .",
    "the observation of the resonant photon drag in monolayer graphene is accessible to the modern experimental technique that allows to investigate interesting aspects of coupling between photons and electrons in this material .",
