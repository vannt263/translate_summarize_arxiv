    "wireless networks are expected to support a variety of applications with diverse quality - of - service ( qos ) requirements . because of the scarcity of network resources ( i.e. , energy and bandwidth ) , radio resource management is crucial to the performance of wireless networks .",
    "the goal is to use the network resources as efficiently as possible while providing the required qos to the users .",
    "adaptive modulation has been shown to be an effective method for improving the spectral efficiency in wireless networks ( see for example @xcite ) . however , the focus of many of the studies to date has been on maximizing the throughput of the network , and the impact of the modulation order on energy efficiency has not been studied to the same extent .",
    "recently , the authors of @xcite have studied modulation optimization for an energy - constrained time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) network .",
    "for such a network , they have used a convex - optimization approach to obtain the best modulation strategy that minimizes the total energy consumption under throughput and delay constraints .",
    "game - theoretic approaches to power control have recently attracted considerable attention ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide motivations for using game theory to study communication systems , and in particular power control . in @xcite , power control",
    "is modeled as a non - cooperative game in which users choose their transmit powers in order to maximize their utilities , where utility is defined as the ratio of throughput to transmit power . a game - theoretic approach to joint power control and receiver design",
    "is presented in @xcite , and power control for multicarrier systems is studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors in @xcite use pricing to obtain a more efficient solution for the power control game .",
    "similar approaches are taken in @xcite for different utility functions .",
    "game - theoretic approaches to power control in delay - constrained networks are proposed in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we use a game - theoretic approach to study the effects of modulation on energy efficiency of code - division - multiple - access ( cdma ) networks in a _ competitive _ multiuser setting . focusing on m - qam modulation",
    ", we propose a _",
    "non - cooperative _ game in which each user chooses its strategy , which includes the choice of the transmit power , transmit symbol rate and constellation size , in order to maximize its own utility while satisfying its qos constraints .",
    "the utility function used here measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed , and is particularly suitable for energy - constrained networks .",
    "we derive the best - response strategies and nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game .",
    "in addition , using our non - cooperative game - theoretic framework , we quantify the tradeoffs among energy efficiency , delay , throughput and modulation order .",
    "the effect of coding on energy efficiency is also studied and quantified using the proposed game - theoretic approach .",
    "in addition , our framework allows us to illustrate the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model and definition of the utility function are given in section  [ systemmodel ] .",
    "we then present a power control game with no delay constraints in section  [ pcg ] and derive the corresponding nash equilibrium solution .",
    "a delay - constrained power control game is proposed in section  [ pcgd ] and the corresponding best - response strategies and nash equilibrium solution are derived .",
    "the analysis is extended to coded systems in section  [ pcgtcm ] .",
    "numerical results and conclusions are given in sections  [ numericalresults ]  and  [ conclusion ] , respectively .",
    "we consider a direct - sequence cdma ( ds - cdma ) wireless network in which the users terminals are transmitting to a common concentration point ( e.g. , a cellular base station or an access point ) .",
    "the system bandwidth is assumed to be @xmath0 hz .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the symbol rate and the transmit power for user @xmath3 , respectively . in this work , we focus on m - qam modulation .",
    "hence , each symbol is assumed to be complex to represent the in - phase and quadrature components . for the m - qam modulation ,",
    "the number of bits transmitted per symbol is given by @xmath4 since there is a one - to - one mapping between @xmath5 and @xmath6 , we sometimes refer to @xmath6 as the constellation size .",
    "we focus on _ square _ m - qam modulation , i.e. , @xmath7 or equivalently @xmath8 , since there are exact expressions for the symbol error probability of square m - qam modulation ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we can easily generalize our analysis to include odd values of @xmath6 by using an approximate expression for the symbol error probability .",
    "we define the utility function of a user as the ratio of its throughput to its transmit power , i.e. , @xmath9 this utility function is similar to the one used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "throughput in is defined as the net number of information bits that are transmitted without error per unit time ( it is sometimes referred to as _ goodput _ ) , and is expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transmission rate , @xmath12 is the output signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sir ) for user @xmath3 , and @xmath13 is the  efficiency function \" which represents the packet success rate ( psr ) for the @xmath3th user .",
    "we require that @xmath14 to ensure that @xmath15 when @xmath16 . in general",
    ", the efficiency function depends on the modulation , coding and packet size .",
    "we assume an automatic - repeat - request ( arq ) mechanism in which the user keeps retransmitting a packet until the packet is received at the access point without any errors .",
    "based on ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq3 ] ) , the utility function for user @xmath3 can be written as @xmath17 this utility function , which has units of _ bits / joule _ , measures the number of reliable bits that are transmitted per joule of energy consumed , and is particularly suitable for energy - constrained networks .",
    "let us for now focus on a specific user and drop the subscript @xmath3 .",
    "assuming a packet size of @xmath18 bits , the packet success rate for square m - qam modulation is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 here , @xmath22 represents the symbol sir and @xmath23 is the complementary cumulative distribution function of the standard gaussian random variable . note that at @xmath24 , we have @xmath25 . since we require the efficiency function to be zero at zero transmit power , we define @xmath26 note that @xmath27 when @xmath18 is large ( e.g. , @xmath28 ) .    a non - cooperative power control game , in general , can be expressed as @xmath29 $ ] where @xmath30 is the set of users / players , @xmath31 is the strategy set for the @xmath3th user , and @xmath32 is the utility function given by .",
    "each user decides what strategy to choose from its strategy set in order to maximize its own utility .",
    "hence , the best - response ( i.e. utility - maximizing ) strategy of user @xmath3 is given by the solution of @xmath33 for this game , a _",
    "nash equilibrium _ is a set of strategies @xmath34 such that no user can unilaterally improve its own utility @xcite , that is , @xmath35    in this work , we propose non - cooperative games in which the actions open to each user are the choice of transmit power , and possibly transmit symbol rate , as well as the choice of _ constellation size_.",
    "consider a ds - cdma network with @xmath36 users and express the transmission rate of user @xmath3 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of information bits per symbol and @xmath1 is the symbol rate . let us for now assume that users have no delay constraints . we propose a power control game in which each user seeks to choose its constellation size and transmit power in order to maximize its own utility , i.e. , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 $ ] with @xmath42 being the maximum allowed transmit power . throughout this work ,",
    "we assume @xmath42 is large .    for all linear receivers",
    ", the output sir for user @xmath3 can be written as @xmath43 where @xmath0 is the system bandwidth and @xmath44 is the effective channel gain which depends on the channel gain of user @xmath3 and on the channel gains and transmit powers of other users in the network but is independent of the transmit power and rate of user @xmath3 .",
    "for example , for a matched - filter receiver , @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the channel gain for user @xmath3 , and @xmath47 is the noise power .",
    "therefore , the utility function in can be written as @xmath48 based on , and by dropping the subscript @xmath3 for convenience , the maximization in can be written as @xmath49 since for a given user , @xmath0 and @xmath50 are fixed , maximizing the user s utility is equivalent to maximizing @xmath51 for that user .",
    "it is important to observe that , for a given @xmath6 , specifying the operating sir completely specifies the utility function .",
    "let us for now fix the symbol rate @xmath52 and the constellation size .",
    "taking the derivative of with respect to @xmath22 and equating it to zero , we conclude that the utility of a user is maximized when its output sir , @xmath22 , is equal to @xmath53 , which is the ( positive ) solution of @xmath54 it is shown in @xcite that for an s - shaped ( sigmoidal ) efficiency function , @xmath55 has a unique solution .",
    "it can easily be verified that @xmath56 given by is s - shaped .",
    "note that @xmath53 is ( uniquely ) determined by physical - layer parameters such as packet size , modulation , and coding .    assuming that @xmath53 is feasible , the maximum utility is hence given by @xmath57 based on , it can be shown that @xmath53 is ( approximately ) given by the solution of @xmath58 we can compute @xmath53 numerically for different values of @xmath6 .",
    "table  [ table1 ] summarizes the results for a system with @xmath28 bits ( i.e. , 100 bits per packet ) .",
    ".summary of the parameters corresponding to the utility - maximizing solutions for different modulation orders for an uncoded system with 100 bits per packet [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we quantify the effect of constellation size on energy efficiency of a user with a delay qos constraint .",
    "the packet size is assumed to be 100 bits , and the source rate ( in bps ) for the user is assumed to be equal to @xmath59 where @xmath0 is the system bandwidth .",
    "we further assume that a user chooses its constellation size , symbol rate , and transmit power according to its best - response strategy corresponding to the pareto - dominant nash equilibrium ( see section  [ ne ] ) .",
    "for the coded system , we assume an 8-state convolutional encoder with rate 2/3 . the code rate for qpsk is chosen to be 1/2 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the optimum constellation size , transmit power , throughput , and user s utility as a function of the delay constraint for both uncoded and coded systems .",
    "the results for the coded case are obtained by using as an approximation for the coding gain . for all four plots ,",
    "the packet delay is normalized by the inverse of the system bandwidth . to keep the spectral efficiency of the two systems the same , we assume that the number of information bits transmitted per symbol is the same for both uncoded and coded systems .",
    "the throughput corresponds to the transmission rate for the user which is obtained by multiplying the symbol rate by the number of ( information ) bits per symbol ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) , and is normalized by the system bandwidth .",
    "the transmit power and user s utility are also normalized by @xmath50 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "let us for now focus on the uncoded system .",
    "when the delay constraint is large , qpsk ( which is the most energy efficient m - qam modulation ) can accommodate the delay requirement and hence is chosen by the user . as the delay constraint becomes tighter , the user increases its symbol rate and also raises the transmit power to keep the output sir at 9.1  db ( recall that @xmath61  db when @xmath62 ) . in this case",
    ", the user s utility stays constant .",
    "once the symbol rate becomes equal to the system bandwidth , the user can not increase it anymore .",
    "hence , as the delay constraint becomes more stringent , the user is forced to aim for a higher target sir to meet its delay requirement . in this case",
    ", the transmission rate stays constant and the transmit power increases .",
    "hence , the user s utility decreases .",
    "as the delay requirement becomes tighter , a point is reached where the spectral efficiency of qpsk is not enough to accommodate the delay constraint . in this case",
    ", the user jumps to a higher - order modulation ( i.e. , 16-qam ) and the process repeats itself .",
    "the trends are similar for the coded system except that , due to coding gain , the required transmit power is smaller for the coded system .",
    "this results in an increase in the user s utility .",
    "this means that , for the same number of information bits transmitted per symbol , the energy efficiency is higher when tcm is used .",
    "in addition , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we have plotted the utility gain achieved due to tcm as a function of normalized packet delay .",
    "it is seen that the gain in energy efficiency due to tcm depends on the delay constraint and fluctuates between 1.5  db and 3  db . in general , for the same delay constraint , the uncoded system has to transmit at a slightly higher symbol rate as compared to the coded system .",
    "this is because @xmath63 ( see table  [ table coded uncoded ] ) . as a result , @xmath64 .",
    "the spikes in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] correspond to the cases in which the uncoded system is transmitting at the maximum possible symbol rate and has to increase its target sir to meet the delay constraint .",
    "this results in a drop in the utility of the uncoded system .",
    "the coded system may still be able to meet the delay constraint without increasing the target sir .",
    "[ fig7 ] shows the user s  size \" , @xmath65 , corresponding to the pareto - dominant nash equilibrium as a function of the packet delay for both uncoded and coded systems . as explained in section  [ ne ] , @xmath65 increases as the delay constraint becomes tighter .",
    "this makes sense because a user would need to consume more network resources to satisfy a more stringent delay .",
    "it is also seen that coding reduces the user s  size \" and , hence , increases the network capacity .",
    "this is because for the same constellation size , the symbol rate and the sir are smaller for the coded system .",
    "we have seen throughout this paper that the strategy that maximizes the user s energy efficiency is not spectrally efficient . to illustrate the energy efficiency - spectral efficiency tradeoff ,",
    "let us fix the symbol rate to be @xmath59 .",
    "for a fixed constellation size , the user s utility ( energy efficiency ) is proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "the spectral efficiency is given by @xmath67 . by varying the constellation size",
    ", we can quantify the tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency .",
    "this tradeoff is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for both uncoded and coded systems . in this figure , we have plotted @xmath66 vs. @xmath67 .",
    "different points on the plot correspond to different values of @xmath6 .",
    "the energy efficiency - spectral efficiency tradeoff is definitely an interesting and important topic that requires more in - depth analysis .",
    "we have studied the effects of modulation order on energy efficiency of wireless networks using a game - theoretic framework . focusing on m - qam modulation ,",
    "we have proposed a non - cooperative game in which each user chooses its strategy in order to maximize its utility while satisfying its delay qos constraint .",
    "the actions open to the users are the choice of the transmit power , transmit symbol rate and constellation size .",
    "the utility function measures the number of reliable bits transmitted per joule of energy consumed and is particularly suitable for energy - constrained networks .",
    "the best - response strategies and the nash equilibrium solution for the proposed game have been derived .",
    "we have shown that to maximize its utility ( i.e. , energy efficiency ) , the user must choose the lowest modulation level that can accommodate the user s delay constraint . using our non - cooperative game - theoretic framework ,",
    "the tradeoffs among energy efficiency , delay , throughput and constellation size have also been studied and quantified . in addition",
    ", we have included the effects of tcm and have shown that , as expected , coding increases energy efficiency .",
