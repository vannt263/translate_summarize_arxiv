    "many network - like structures in nature are composed of filaments forming intricate interconnected arrays across different scales of organisation .",
    "for instance , filamentous structures can be observed in networks of cellulose polymers in the primary cell wall of plants and algae @xcite , cytoskeletal networks of actin filaments or microtubules in cells across all domains of life @xcite , networks of neurons @xcite , root systems @xcite , as well as solar prominences @xcite and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "network - based studies of these structures have already elucidated important aspects such as the mechanics of cellulose networks @xcite , transport on cytoskeletal actin networks @xcite , and connectivity patterns in the brain @xcite .",
    "however , the network links usually correspond to segments of the filaments ; therefore , the classical network - based analysis neglects the identities of individual filaments .",
    "a few powerful exceptions have recently started to emerge @xcite which may identify multiple segments that belong to the same filament ; yet , since these studies do not capture filament overlaps , filaments are still broken into potentially multiple fragments .",
    "characterisation of the mechanical- @xcite , transport- @xcite , and information - transmission related properties @xcite in such network representations may hence lead to erroneous conclusions due to their differences within and between filaments .",

    ", this method can not be employed to pinpoint individual filaments .",
    "another method decomposes entire images of filamentous structures into linear segments based on a linear programming formulation @xcite . while this method utilises few parameters ( e.g. , number of filaments ) , it only models and extracts a representative set of linear filaments .",
    "moreover , filaments have been modelled as linear segments , detected by co - localisation with a parallel grid at different orientations and by using manually chosen intensity thresholds along a filament @xcite .",
    "while this method is fast and useful for extracting linear filaments ( e.g. , microtubules ) , it does not capture bent or tangled filaments and necessitates manual parameter selection . alternatively , tracing- and tracking - based methods which start from one or multiple image points and predict neighbouring points on a putative filament through optimisation of an energy function are powerful methods for filament identification .",
    "although these algorithms have led to great insights , especially into the connectome , they typically require user input and do not capture overlapping filaments @xcite . using a similar approach ,",
    "open contour - based methods employ deformable curve models that elongate and align according to an energy functional to match the target filaments .",
    "recent advances in open contour - based approaches enable fully automated filament detection @xcite , but can account for the overlap of only few filaments at the expense of parameter tuning @xcite .",
    "the second class of approaches for disentangling filamentous structures employs a two - step procedure : first , weighted networks are extracted from image data from different systems and imaging sources .",
    "there is a large variety of algorithms for this task @xcite which vary , in particular , in the number of parameters .",
    "some of the methods from the first class , presented above , may also be used to obtain such network representations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "second , the given , weighted networks are decomposed into filaments .",
    "the two existing methods for this task @xcite define specific junctions for bifurcations and crossings of filaments , depending on the distances between nodes , and assign filament identities according to manually chosen angle thresholds between incoming and outgoing edges .",
    "in particular , they strongly restrict the potential overlap of filaments and , due to the angle constraints , allow only crossing but no touching filaments .",
    "most importantly , these methods require manual parameter selection and do not take into account filament intensity / thickness .",
    "we note that the step of decomposing a given network may also be beneficially applied to networks obtained , e.g. , by open contour - based approaches in which filaments have been fragmented due to omission of filament overlaps @xcite .    here , we propose a robust approach to decompose a weighted network into an optimal set of individual filaments .",

    "the decomposition is based on a computationally difficult problem , referred to as filament cover problem ( fcp ) , for which we propose suitable approximation algorithms .",
    "we test and demonstrate the accuracy of the findings from the approximation algorithms on artificial as well as biological and cosmic filamentous networks by comparison to manually obtained filament covers .",
    "in addition , we demonstrate that the proposed , fully automated solution allows facile characterisation of well - studied properties of individual filaments , for which alternative approaches require parameter tuning or time - consuming manual tracing .",
    "the proposed approach is implemented in a publicly available open - source tool , `` define '' ( * * de**composing * * fi**lamentous * * ne**tworks ) , which can be used to decompose any given weighted network into a set of individual filaments for further analyses ( http://mathbiol.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/define/ ) .",

    "the quality of a given filament @xmath20 is assessed by the pairwise filament roughness @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the weight of the @xmath19-th edge in filament @xmath20 .",
    "the pairwise filament roughness is small if the edge weights along a filament vary smoothly , as expected for natural filaments ( but cf",

    "other roughness measures may be readily introduced that take into account filament thicknesses or alignments .",
    "as an additional example , we study the all - to - all filament roughness @xmath23 which is the average maximal difference between any two edge weights in a filament @xmath20 , and again the original weight of the edge is used for a filament of length one . taking into account that most filaments are only moderately bent , we further consider the maximal filament deflection angle between adjacent edges of a path @xmath20 , @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 denote the positions of the start and end nodes of the @xmath19-th edge of filament @xmath20 , respectively .",

    "we quantify the similarity of the two partitions of the set of edges into ( potentially overlapping ) filaments using the variation of information,@xmath50 , the jaccard index , @xmath51 , and the rand index , @xmath52 ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "a filamentous network is naturally represented as a weighted graph , whereby the links ( i.e. , edges ) denote segments of filaments and the nodes represent the ends of the segments .",

    "we seek a decomposition of the set of edges into paths so that each edge is covered ( i.e. , belongs to at least one path ) .",
    "edges belonging to more than one path naturally model filament overlaps .",
    "we will refer to such a decomposition as a filament cover . since a filament cover is non - unique",
    ", we introduce a quality measure , called roughness , to assess the quality of each path and the cover itself . here",
    "we mainly consider the pairwise filament roughness given by the average absolute value of weight differences between adjacent edges .",
    "this roughness measure quantifies how strongly the thickness varies along a filament and is typically small for biological filaments . disentangling the filamentous network",
    "amounts to solving the filament cover problem ( fcp ) : find a set of paths of minimum sum of roughness values that covers the network ( cf .",
    "methods and supplemental material s1 for the mathematical formulation ) .",
    "the fcp formulation is quite versatile : for instance , instead of minimising the total roughness of the filament cover , we may minimise the average roughness . this optimisation objective favours",
    "shorter filaments and may be more appropriate for specific types of networks .",
    "other roughness measures ( e.g. , considering the spatial alignment of edges to penalise filaments with strong curvature ) are readily introduced and can be considered in a multi - objective optimisation approach ( cf .",
    "methods and supplemental material s1 for different measures ) .",
    "while providing a well - defined approach towards disentangling filamentous networks , solving the fcp is computationally prohibitive .",
    "indeed , we show that the fcp is intractable even on planar graphs ( cf .  methods and supplemental material s2 ) which are used to represent filamentous structures extracted from 2d image data @xcite . while the fcp is solvable in polynomial time on trees ( cf .",
    "supplemental material s3 ) , most biological filamentous structures are not tree - like as they contain loops @xcite .",
    "therefore , we propose suitable approximation schemes to the fcp for the considered networks ( cf .  methods and supplemental material s4 for details and the mathematical formulation ) .",
    "the approximation schemes rely on collecting a large sample of paths in a given graph , followed by the computation of the roughness of each path .",
    "the paths are collected by performing a modified breadth - first search ( bfs ) or by sampling from random minimum spanning trees ( rmst ) .",
    "next , we write the fcp as classical set cover problem @xcite which aims at covering the set of edges with a subset of the collected paths of minimum total or average roughness .",
    "the set cover approximation of fcp can be formulated and solved as a ( fractional ) binary linear program for which well - established algorithms exist @xcite .",
    "the output of the program is a set of paths which correspond to the individual filaments of the studied network .",
    "summarising , the fcp may be solved with different options : the initial set of paths is obtained from a modified bfs ( denoted by _ bfs _ ) or sampling of rmsts ( _ rmst _ ) , the filaments may overlap ( _ over _ ) or not ( _ exact _ ) , a pairwise ( _ pair _ ) or all - to - all filament roughness measure ( _ all _ ) is used , and the total ( _ total _ ) or average ( _ avg _ ) roughness is minimised .",
    "since all these options are categorical , all possible @xmath70 combinations may be readily checked and no data - specific and computationally demanding gauging of continuous parameters is necessary , as is the case for related approaches @xcite .",
    "we provide an open - source implementation of our approach , termed `` define '' ( * * de**composing * * fi**lamentous * * ne**tworks ) , with a simple and user - friendly graphical user interface available at http://mathbiol.mpimp - golm.mpg.de / define/. define takes as input a weighted graph in the standard  .gml file format @xcite and outputs a  .gml graph with filament identities stored as edge colours as well as a standard , human - readable  .csv - table of various individual filament measures for custom analyses .",
    "to test the accuracy of our approach , we investigate an artificial network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]a ) of pre - specified filamentous structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]b ; cf .  methods and supplemental material s4 for the extraction of the network ; cf .",
    "supplemental material s9 for an overview of the different stages of our approach , from an images to a network to filaments ) .",
    "the network contains crossing and overlapping filaments as well as a loop ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]b , @xmath71 , , and @xmath72 , respectively ) .",
    "first , we automatically decompose the weighted filamentous network by solving the fcp for a set of input paths from a modified bfs , allowing for overlaps , using the pairwise roughness measure , and minimising the total roughness of the cover ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]c , cf .",
    ".  [ eq : lp_frac ] ) .",
    "the filament identities and colours are matched by solving an assignment problem ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) such that the total number of edges shared by two filaments , from the manual assignment and the automated cover , is maximised .",
    "the agreement between the automated cover and the manual assignment may be measured by classical partition similarity measures such as the jaccard index @xmath51 which counts the fraction of edge pairs which are part of same filament @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath51 does not take into account the structure of the underlying network .",
    "hence , we introduced a new similarity measure , @xmath65 , that considers only pairs of adjacent edges in each filament and thus incorporates the network structure ( cf .",
    "methods and and supplemental material s6 for details , a generalisation to @xmath73 that considers only pairs of edges which are separated by at most @xmath63 nodes , and a comparison of various similarity measures ) . for our artificial network , solving the above fcp yields a decomposition which agrees excellently with the manual assignment ( @xmath74 ) as all filaments are correctly detected .",
    "second , we choose a different set of input paths obtained from sampling rmsts for solving th fcp ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]d ) . while most filaments are correctly detected , the loop ( cf",
    ".  fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]b ) is over - segmented ( @xmath75 ) because it is not contained in the set of input paths in its entirety ( due to looplessness of trees ) .",
    "third , we solve the exact fcp which does not allow overlapping filaments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]e ) .",
    "expectedly , the agreement with the manual assignments is lower because filaments are over - segmented into disjoint segments and the supposedly overlapping parts are under - segmented ( @xmath76 ) , i.e. , the respective edges are assigned to a single filament instead of multiple filaments . finally , we employ the all - to - all roughness measure to assess the quality of the filaments ( fig .  [",
    "fig : res_artificial]f , cf .",
    ".  [ eq : r_all ] ) .",
    "filament crossings , overlaps , and the loop are again correctly detected but parts of two filaments are interchanged ( cf .",
    "@xmath75 ) .",
    "this is due to the intensity / thickness of the underlying filaments which is consistently higher for the new detected filaments which are therefore favoured by the all - to - all roughness measure .",
    "these test cases demonstrate the versatility and the accuracy of the proposed approach to decompose a given network into filaments .    in the analysis of many real - world filamentous structures ,",
    "the knowledge of the underlying network structure is incomplete or the image data impede filament detection due to low signal - to - noise ratios . to investigate the effect of these obstacles on robust filament detection , we study two scenarios ( supplemental material s7 ) : in the first scenario ,",
    "we remove a single edge from the network , recompute the optimal filament cover , and calculate its agreement with the manual filament assignment as measured by the structure - aware jaccard index @xmath65 .",
    "we repeat the procedure for all @xmath77 edges and then proceed with the removal of @xmath77 randomly chosen doubles of edges , triplets , up to subsets of@xmath78 edges .",
    "as expected , the accuracy of the filament cover typically decreases with the number of removed edges , although removal of some specific edges even leads to an increase in accuracy .",
    "however , @xmath65 decreases very moderately by less than @xmath79 per removed edge on average ( cf .",
    "supplemental material s7 ) . in the second scenario ,",
    "we assess the robustness of our filament detection approach against noise by adding centred gaussian noise of increasing standard deviation to the edge weights of the original network . for a given standard deviation",
    ", we obtain the optimal filament covers for @xmath68 noisy network instances and compute their similarity , @xmath65 , to the manual assignment . again , as expected , the accuracy of the filament cover decreases with increasing noise , but only slightly . on average , increasing the noise by @xmath80 of the original edge weights only decreases @xmath65 by less than @xmath79 .",
    "moreover , we note that with increasing edge noise the accuracy of the filament cover approaches a constant , non - zero @xmath65 which reflects that some information about the filament structure maybe obtained from the topology of the network alone , irrespective of the edge weights ( cf .",
    "supplemental material s7 ) .          since we demonstrated the power of the fcp - based approach on contrived filamentous structures , we next proceed with investigating real biological and cosmic filamentous structures ( cf .",
    "methods and supplemental material s5 for the extraction of the networks ; cf .",
    "supplemental material s9 for an overview of the different stages of our approach ) . as a first illustrative example of a biological filamentous structure , we extract a weighted network from an image of a hippocampal neuron ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_neuron]a ) and manually obtain a filament assignment with several crossings and loops ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_neuron]b , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively ) . solving the fcp ( same options as in fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial]e ) yields an automated decomposition which captures well the manual assignment , in particular the two loops ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_neuron]c , @xmath81 ) .",
    "this is further supported by the distributions of filament lengths ( measured by the numbers of edges ) as well as the distributions of maximal filament angles ( measured between adjacent edges ) , which are statistically indistinguishable between the manual assignment and the automated decomposition ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_neuron]d , black and red ; kolmogorov - smirnov test @xmath20-value @xmath82 ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the similarity of manual and automated decompositions shows that the classical rand index @xmath52 @xcite overestimates the similarity , while the variation of information @xmath50 @xcite and the jaccard index @xmath51 severely underestimate the similarity between the manual and automated decomposition when compared to the values of the here - proposed @xmath64 and @xmath65(fig .",
    "[ fig : res_neuron]e , dotted blue , green , and yellow ) .",
    "the latter measures take into consideration the network structure when comparing two network decompositions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_neuron]e , solid blue and yellow ) .",
    "we would like to emphasise that the disparities in the estimations of @xmath52 and @xmath51 result from the consideration of distant , non - adjacent edges which are excluded in @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , we observe that @xmath83 and @xmath73 show a non - trivial dependence on the distance , @xmath63 , between the considered edges , and coincide with the classical similarity measure for large enough distances , i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( cf .",
    "supplemental material s6 for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "finally , different flavours of the fcp may be solved , as mentioned above , to obtain decompositions of varying similarity in comparison to the manual assignment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_neuron]f ) . solving the fcp with paths from the modified bfs , instead of rmsts , yields consistently higher @xmath64- and @xmath65-values for the agreement with the manual assignment .",
    "this is due to the higher flexibility with respect to the treatment of loops . for the studied networks , a decomposition based on the minimisation of the total roughness yields higher @xmath64- and @xmath65-values in comparison to the minimisation of the average roughness .",
    "in addition , in terms of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , covers allowing for overlaps yield better agreement with the manual assignment , in comparison to those in which each edge is covered by a single path .",
    "however , these expected trends are absent or even reversed for the classical similarity measures @xmath50 , @xmath52 , and @xmath51 ( cf .",
    "supplemental material s6 ) , which further justifies the usage of the here - proposed @xmath64 and @xmath65 for comparing decompositions of networks arising in other network - based analyses ( cf .",

    "we note that the sum of filament roughnesses , @xmath36 , is larger for the manual assignment of filaments than in the automated decomposition , as expected , as @xmath36 is the objective function of the minimisation in the fcp - based formulation .    by investigating the relationship between filament length and pairwise roughness",
    ", we can distinguish three regions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]f ) : long filaments typically correspond to actin bundles and exhibit small roughnesses ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]@xmath87 ) , the majority of filaments is shorter with comparable roughnesses ( fig .  [",
    "fig : res_actin]@xmath88 ) , and some typically short filaments consist of only one edge with roughness given by the edge weight itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]@xmath89 ; cf .",
    ".  [ eq : r_pair ] ) .",
    "the angular distribution of filaments indicates that the majority of filaments is aligned parallel to the cell axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]f , dashed grey line ) which has been suggested to support longitudinal cell growth @xcite .",
    "while these reports of longitudinal alignment of the actin cytoskeleton were based on manual or qualitative measurements , our approach facilitates fully automated quantification of the alignment of individual filaments .",
    "our findings show that the length of a filament correlates with its average weight ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]g ; pearson correlation coefficient @xmath90 and @xmath20-value @xmath91 ) , i.e. , thicker actin bundles stretch across the cell while individual thinner actin filaments are more locally confined , as expected @xcite .    finally , we study filament convolutedness , given by the ratio of the length of a filament and the largest side of a bounding box enclosing the filament , used as a measure for the curvedness of a filament @xcite .",
    "we find that the convolutedness is slightly negatively correlated with the filament length ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]i , red ; @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) , in agreement with previous findings in _ arabidopsis _ _ thaliana _ pollen grain @xcite and other plant species @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the automated approach used here , the existing studies of filament convolutedness required manual segmentation which may be biased by the user . generally , and more severely , using a bounding rectangle to compute the convolutedness of a filament",
    "is biased by the orientation of the filament with respect to the x- and y - axis of the image .",
    "therefore , we use the maximal filament angle as a non - biased measure for the maximal , local curvedness of a filament . by investigating the relation between the maximal filament angle and filament length",
    ", we find a significant negative correlation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]i , grey ; @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) .",
    "this negative correlation reflects the known increase in stiffness of actin bundles with increasing bundledness and length @xcite .",
    "thus , our approach provides a fast means to investigate this property for individual filaments in a cellular context without laborious manual filament identification .    to further extend these findings",
    ", we extract the cytoskeletal networks from @xmath68 frames of a movie of a plant actin cytoskeleton ( cf .",
    "methods ) . for each frame , we compute the optimal filament covers and analyse the filaments .",
    "the additional data support our reported findings ( supplemental material s8 ) .",
    "moreover , we repeat our analyses of the robustness of our approach against incomplete knowledge of the underlying network structure or noisy edge weights for the cytoskeletal network ( cf .  discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial ] ; supplemental material s7 ) . in our first scenario ,",
    "the removal of increasing numbers of edges typically moderately decreases the accuracy of the obtained filament covers , i.e. , their agreement with the manual assignment as measured by @xmath65 . while the removal of some critical edges leads to a more severe decrease in accuracy ,",
    "there exist edges whose removal leads to an increase in accuracy . on average , the removal of one additional edge decreases @xmath65 by around @xmath96 .",
    "consequently , a loss of @xmath97 of the cytoskeletal network s @xmath98 edges still yields @xmath99 which is comparable to similarity values between different manual assignments ( cf .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]d ; cf .  supplemental material s7 ) . in our second scenario ,",
    "the adding of gaussian noise of increasing standard deviation to the edge weights similarly , as expected , decreases the accuracy of the obtained filament covers .",
    "however , this effect is moderate , i.e , increasing the standard deviation by @xmath80 of the original edge weight decreases @xmath65 by less than @xmath79 . adding noise with a standard deviation of @xmath100 of the original edges weights",
    "still yields @xmath99 . as for the robustness analyses of the contrived network , for strong noise",
    ", @xmath65 tends to a constant , non - zero value which suggests that some information about the filament structure may be obtained solely from the network topology , irrespective of the edge weights ( cf .",
    "discussion of fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial ] ; cf .  supplemental material s7 ) .        as a final example , we decompose the network of a simulated galaxy cluster ( fig .  [",
    "fig : res_galaxy]a ) into individual galaxy filaments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_galaxy]b ) .",
    "the quantification of galaxy filaments may help to elucidate the acceleration of the universe @xcite and improve our understanding of large - scale structure formation @xcite .",
    "moreover , studies have revealed gravitational motion of galaxies along individual filaments @xcite . yet , previous studies focused on connected components of the cosmic web , and sought robust methods to identify individual filaments @xcite .",
    "our approach confirms the expected discrepancy between the lengths of the components ( i.e. , the sum of their edge lengths ; fig .",

    "[ fig : res_galaxy]c , upper panel , red ; cf .",
    "average @xmath101-values )",
    ". moreover , the decomposition of the cosmic structures enables analyses of individual filament shapes .",
    "for example , the convolutedness which measures the curvedness of a filament shows small values ( fig .",
    "[ fig : res_galaxy ] , lower panel ) , which are interestingly comparable to those found in the actin cytoskeleton ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]i ; cf .",
    "average @xmath102-values ) , indicating the prevalence of straight galaxy filaments .    [ cols=\"^,<,<,<,<,<,<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in tab .",
    "[ tab : res_overview ] , we summarise the quality of the investigated decompositions of different filamentous networks and the options of the underlying fcp ( cf .  supplemental material s8 and s9 for analyses of additional filamentous networks that are not shown in the main text ) .",
    "the decomposition of complex networks into meaningful substructures has facilitated network - based analyses of systems found in nature or designed by humans @xcite .",
    "these natural and technical networks often embed filaments as basic building units . to enable deeper understanding of network systems with filamentous structure ,",
    "it is therefore paramount to develop methods for accurate and feasible identification of the underlying filaments . in particular",
    ", the distinction between intra- and inter - filament connections enables a more detailed analysis of filamentous structures , including length statistics , spatial alignment , and bending of individual filaments .",
    "such statistics may offer new insights , e.g. , into the role of single actin or galaxy filaments in their cellular or cosmic network context , respectively ( cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig : res_actin]e - i and [ fig : res_galaxy]c ) .    here , we proposed a robust optimisation approach to decompose any given weighted network into a set of smooth filaments comprising a filament cover . since we demonstrated that the filament cover problem is intractable on general networks , we proposed , tested , and validated several alternative approximation schemes .",
    "the proposed approximation schemes are gauged at applications from different scientific fields in which filamentous structures naturally arise .",
    "we applied our optimisation - based approach on contrived test cases as well as biological and cosmic networks , and showed that it reliably identifies crossing , ( non- ) overlapping , and looped filaments in agreement with expert - based manual assignments .",
    "our approach offers a number of advantages over the existing alternatives : ( 1 ) the proposed optimisation approach can be applied to any weighted network . in particular , the approach can be readily applied to any network generated from two- or three - dimensional experimental image data typically gathered in biological studies and analyses of man - made systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) , irrespective of the image source ( e.g. , light microscopy- or mri - based ) .",
    "thus , it may be used to study a variety of natural and technical filamentous structures in search for universal properties which go beyond the characterisation of geometric networks @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) our approach facilitates the establishment of a link between the dynamics of individual filaments and the dynamics of the whole network .",
    "while the dynamics of individual filaments is guided by typically molecular , local processes , the behaviour of the entire filamentous structure incorporates and responds to stimuli across different scales .",
    "therefore , the proposed approach provides the starting point towards network - oriented analysis of filaments .",
    "more specifically , the filament covers may even be used to track mobile filaments , as has been proposed for images of a few filaments using open contours @xcite , providing a venue for fruitful applications of the method .",
    "\\(3 ) the different options of our approach , e.g. , different measures of the filament roughness , enable flexible and intuitive customisation for different types of networks .",
    "for example , the filament roughness measure may include a penalty for filament bending in networks of straight , stiff filaments ( such as microtubules @xcite ) , or a penalty for length deviations in networks of filaments of mostly uniform length ( such as synthetic polymers that are used , e.g. , in drug delivery systems @xcite ) .",
    "\\(4 ) at the same time , our approach to disentangle a given network is parsimonious , i.e. , it has a strictly limited number of categorical options which allow testing of all possible combinations ( @xmath103 in total ) .",
    "in contrast , approaches which rely on multiple continuous parameters require data - specific and computationally expensive gauging of the parameters @xcite .",
    "when compared to approaches which detect filaments directly from image data , however , the parsimony of our approach is counterbalanced by the parameter requirements of the preceding network extraction procedure .",
    "\\(5 ) nevertheless , approaches that detect filaments directly from image data typically rely on local optimisation schemes and thus , e.g. , on the order of filament initialisations and definitions of local filament properties @xcite .",
    "in contrast , our approach offer the advantage that the decomposition into filaments is performed in a single optimisation step which holistically considers the global structure of both filaments and network .",
    "\\(6 ) finally , since our approach replies on a general network representation , it may be applied also to networks obtained from other , e.g. , open contour - based methods which often do not capture filament overlaps and result in fragmented filaments @xcite . in a post - processing step",
    ", these fragments may be conveniently merged using our network - based approach ( cf .",
    "supplemental material 10 ) .    yet",
    ", some caution is warranted : ( 1 ) the available options of the fcp yield different decompositions .",
    "we showed that paths sampled from a modified bfs enable more flexible and more accurate decompositions in comparison to paths sampled from rmsts ( cf .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial ] ) ; in contrast to minimising the the average roughness , the minimisation of the total roughness favours longer filaments in better accordance with the manual assignments ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : res_artificial ] ) ; moreover , since filament overlaps in biological systems may lead to an abrupt increase in apparent filament thickness , the proposed all - to - all filament roughness may be more suitable to study such situations than the pairwise filament roughness which favours filaments of slowly varying thickness .",
    "therefore , the suitable choice of feasible and suitable options has to be further investigated .",
    "for example , for the actin cytoskeletal networks , it is not obvious if overlapping filaments should be preferred over non - overlapping filaments and if the pairwise roughness is a better measure of filament quality than the all - to - all roughness . yet , such decision problems are innate not only to all automated decomposition algorithms , but also to the manual assignment based on which the performance is assessed .",
    "thus , exploring different decomposition options by an expert in the field may hint at the right choice .",
    "\\(2 ) the quality of the filament cover clearly depends on the quality of the input network . to this end",
    ", several algorithms have been proposed for the extraction of various types of networks from image data with low error rates @xcite .",
    "moreover , we investigated different scenarios to test the robustness of our approach against incomplete knowledge of the underlying network structure as well as low signal - to - noise ratios and found that the accuracy of the filament cover is only moderately affected by these obstacles ( cf .",
    "supplemental material s7 ) .",
    "\\(3 ) another issue are the computational requirements of the fcp .",
    "although our proposed approximation scheme employs a modified bfs and a binary linear program which run fast on the tested networks , it may become infeasible for larger networks comprising more edges or nodes of larger degrees . therefore , future efforts may focus on devising algorithms which approximate the fcp by employing local searches , i.e. , without sampling a large number of paths for the proposed set cover - based approximation scheme .",
    "\\(4 ) finally , we note that many polymers are not simple linear chains but branched tree - like structures @xcite .",
    "also many neurons may be naturally described as tree - like structures @xcite .",
    "our approach can be extended to account for these cases , thus , opening a new field of research . to this end , covering networks with more complex structures , such as stars @xcite or , more generally , trees @xcite may be employed . due to intractability of these problems , investigation of approximation schemes like our set cover formulation will be needed",
    ". a central question will be the development of measures for the quality of a given star or tree cover .    in conclusion , by decomposing technically and biologically relevant filamentous structures into their constitutive filaments ,",

    "an intuitive choice is the pairwise filament roughness of @xmath20 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : r_pair ] ) , @xmath111 where @xmath22 denotes the weight of the @xmath19-th edge in filament @xmath20 .",
    "the pairwise filament roughness is the average absolute value of the difference between weights of adjacent edges .",

    "this is intuitively clear as the number of paths ( let alone the number of path covers ) increases rapidly with the number of nodes @xmath116 . even in planar graphs",
    ", the number of closed paths visiting each node once was shown to increase at least exponentially with @xmath116 @xcite .",
    "we show now that the fcp is np - hard , even for planar , cubic graphs .",
    "planar graphs can be drawn on a plane without crossing edges .",
    "they are of particular relevance since graphs that are generated from two - dimensional image data are planar by construction @xcite .",
    "cubic graphs have only nodes of degree three .",
    "a proof of np - hardness of a problem for planar , cubic graphs directly implies its np - hardness on general graphs .",
    "the basic idea of a typical proof of computational complexity is as follows @xcite : a problem of known complexity is selected . by providing a constructive transformation or reduction ,",
    "a bijection between the known problem and the problem in question is established , i.e. , any yes - instance of the decision - version of the known problem is mapped to a yes - instance of the decision - version of the problem of interest and analogously for the no - instances .",
    "this reduction proves that the two problems fall into the same class of computational complexity .",
    "our proof is by reduction from the hamiltonian path problem ( hpp ) on planar , cubic graphs which is known to be np - complete @xcite .",
    "the hpp asks , for a given graph , whether there is a node - path which visits each node exactly once .",
    "first , we note that finding a filament cover on an edge - weighted graph @xmath32 is equivalent to finding a node - path cover on its node - weighted line graph @xmath117 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : app_proof]a and b ) . the line graph @xmath117 of a graph",
    "@xmath32 has a node of weight @xmath8 for each edge @xmath118 in @xmath32 and edges connecting two nodes if the corresponding edges share a node in @xmath32 .",
    "second , for a given line graph @xmath117 , we construct a graph such that finding a node - path cover of weight @xmath114 or less is equivalent to solving the hpp . to that end , we add one edge with a terminal node to the line graph and set all original node - weights to @xmath114 and the new node - weight to @xmath77 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : app_proof]c ) .",
    "then , only a hamiltonian path ensures a minimal weight of @xmath119 , for both pairwise and all - to - all filament roughness @xmath120 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : supp_r_pair ] and [ eq : supp_r_all ] ) and both minimisation of total and average filament roughness , i.e. , @xmath42 .",
    "finally , we show that finding a hamiltonian path on a line graph of a planar , cubic graph is np - complete .",
    "it was shown that the hpp is np - complete on general line graphs via a reduction from the hpp in cubic graphs @xcite .",
    "this reduction remains valid when planar , cubic graphs are used instead of cubic graphs , for which np - completeness of hpp is known @xcite .",

    "the polynomial algorithm outlined here is similar to those proposed to find an unrestricted node - path cover where each vertex may be included in multiple paths of minimum cardinality or minimum weight @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to assume that a certain path covering a certain edge is in the cover ( in a tree , there are at most @xmath121 paths to choose from ) . upon removal ,",

    "the extraction of the filamentous networks from image data enables comparison of the automated filament cover with manual filament assignments . both , automated cover and manual assignment may be regarded as partitions ( where we allow overlapping subsets as well ) . as measures for the similarity of the automated and manual partitions we use the variation of information,@xmath50 , the jaccard index , @xmath51 , and the rand index , @xmath52 , which are commonly used and were shown to estimate similarity reliably for distant and close partitions alike @xcite . for given partitions @xmath153 and @xmath154 ,",

    "while the jaccard index , @xmath51 , and the rand index , @xmath52 , cover intersecting partitions they may generally yield opposing results .",
    "we demonstrate this inconsistency by investigating two types of random partitionings : first , for @xmath68 repetitions , we randomly partitioned @xmath157 sets of @xmath68 numbers and up to @xmath158 duplicates ( to simulate overlapping filaments ) into @xmath159 random partitions ( fig .",

    "<S> in particular , we show that the proposed approach provides powerful automated means to study properties of individual actin filaments in their network context . </S>",
    "<S> our solution is made publicly available as an open - source tool , http://mathbiol.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/define/[define ] , facilitating decomposition of any given network into individual filaments .    </S>",
