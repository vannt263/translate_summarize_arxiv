    "@xcite aims at counting the number of arcs in cluster samples and comparing with the predictions from cosmological models .",
    "both approaches require the lens equation to be solved numerically for finite sources numerous times .",
    "the inverse modelling typically needs arc images obtained from a multidimensional space of source positions and lens parameters scanned during the minimization process to find the best solution for sources and lenses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason analyses using the inverse modelling are often restricted to simple lens models , in particular models with elliptic lens potentials ( so - called pseudo - elliptical ) and/or to point sources , for example , considering bright spots in arcs as multiple images of point sources @xcite .    for arc statistics , predictions for the arc cross section",

    "the cross section is then convolved with the distribution of lens properties expected in a given cosmology and convolved with the source distribution .",
    "another approach is to use directly high resolution n - body simulations obtaining arc images by ray - tracing through the mass distribution for a large number of sources @xcite .",
    "it is therefore useful to develop approximate methods for obtaining gravitational arcs , which will be particularly useful given the increase of strong lensing systems to be discovered by the next generation wide - field surveys . a most promising technique for this purpose is given by the perturbative approach @xcite , which provides an approximate solution for the lens equation close to the einstein ring , leading to analytic solutions for arcs .",
    "the power of this approach is that it can be applied , in principle , to generic lens models , including those arising from simulations .",
    "the method is suitable for large tangential arcs , since the solutions are accurate for images located close to the einstein ring corresponding to the circularly averaged lensing potential .",
    "another important feature of the method is that it naturally reproduces arcs resulting from the merger of multiple images , which can not be accounted for with other approximate methods for arcs proposed in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such merger arcs are key for lens inversion methods and also play an important role in the arc cross section @xcite .",

    "an important issue for practical applications of this approach is the determination of its domain of validity .",
    "this topic is discussed in @xcite , comparisons with arc simulations are presented in @xcite , and a recent work by @xcite has investigated arcs in several configurations for a pseudo - elliptical model in this approach . however a systematic study of its limit of applicability has not yet been carried out . in this paper",

    "this technique goes beyond other analytical approximations in the literature in that it may be used for generic lens models ( including mass distributions arising from n - body simulations ) and for finite sources .",
    "a key aspect for practical applications of the method that has not been systematically addressed before is the determination of its limit of validity .",
    "motivated by this issue , in this paper we aimed to determine the accuracy of the perturbative approach for caustics and critical curves and for the deformation arc cross section .",
    "although these quantities do not involve arcs ( i.e. the lensing of finite sources ) they allow one to obtain limits on the accuracy of the linearized mapping from the perturbative approach . also , the parameter space to be probed is significantly decreased , since these quantities depend basically on the lens properties and not the source ones .",
    "we have considered a restricted set of lens models , more specifically those with elliptical lens potentials , and in particular the pnfw and siep models , which are nevertheless widely used in strong lensing applications , specially for the inverse modelling .",

    "axially symmetric models the cross section is obtained in closed form ( eq .  [ sigma_mp - axial ] ) .",
    "we have obtained simple analytic expressions for the perturbative functions for pseudo - elliptical models , which are valid for any choice of the ellipticity parametrization ( eq . [ dfn_pe ] ) .",
    "these expressions generalize those given in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "we derive approximate solutions to the tangential critical curve ( eq .",
    "[ xt_approx ] ) and for the deformation cross section ( eq . [ cross_section - approx ] ) for low ellipticities in pseudo - elliptical models .",
    "we show that the deviation of the cross section with respect to the axially symmetric case is quadratic in the ellipticity .",
    "we have considered the siep and the pnfw models to represent lenses at galaxy and galaxy cluster mass scales .",
    "we have shown that the perturbative approach provides the exact solution for the siep model .",
    "for the pnfw model , we compared the critical curves and caustics obtained with this approach with those obtained with the exact solution for a wide range of values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "we show that the criterion @xmath156 proposed by @xcite extended to be applied the tangential critical curve ( eq .  [ dmax_pnfw ] ) , is not adequate to set a limit of validity for these cases . to this end",
    ", we use a figure - of - merit , @xmath123 ( eq .",
    "[ d2_pm ] ) to quantify the deviation of the perturbative approach from the exact solution for caustics and critical curves .",

    "in particular , @xmath123 decreases with @xmath1 ( as can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ pnfw_ccurves_mp - se ] ) and increases with @xmath0 ( as expected from the increasing of the perturbation to the lensing potential with @xmath0 ) . since the deviation between the exact and perturbative solutions for caustics is higher than the deviation for critical curves , it is sufficient to set a limit on @xmath123 for caustics to ensure a small deviation for critical curves .    by setting a threshold on @xmath123 computed at caustics ,",
    "a maximum value of @xmath0 is determined for each @xmath1 , such that a good matching for caustics and also for critical curves is ensured .",
    "we determine these maximum values @xmath164 by choosing @xmath190 .",
    "this defines a domain of applicability of the perturbative approach for the pnfw model in the range of @xmath1 being considered .",
    "we provide a fitting function for @xmath164 ( eq . [ emax_pm_fit ] ) . for @xmath191 ,",
    "the perturbative approach is limited to @xmath192 .",
    "however , for @xmath193 it is possible to use this approach even up to @xmath194 for these cases .",
    "another limit on the pfnw model parameters is obtained from the comparison of the deformation cross section for both exact and perturbative calculations .",
    "the fractional deviation is less than 10% ( fig .",
    "[ dcs_pnfw - space ] ) for @xmath178 and @xmath195 ( corresponding to @xmath196 ) .",
    "we may use these results to set further constraints on the ellipticity parameter of the pnfw model , by requiring an agreement with the exact @xmath94 , besides the condition @xmath197 .",
    "this ensures that caustics , critical curves , and the local mapping are well reproduced by the perturbative approach for the pnfw model .",
    "the combined restriction , imposing the matching for caustics and an agreement to about 10% for deformation cross sections , is given in eq .",
    "( [ region_lt-10 ] ) .    in this paper we provided a first systematic attempt to set limits on the domain of applicability of the perturbative approach for strong lensing in terms of the parameters of a given lens model , more specifically for the pnfw model .",
    "the limits are imposed so that the caustics , critical curves and deformation cross section match the exact solutions with a given accuracy .",
    "although these quantities are useful for strong lensing applications , it is important to determine a domain of validity for arcs / finite sources .",
    "for example , @xcite investigated the domain of validity of the perturbative approach for extended circular sources .",
    "it is argued that perturbative approach can be used for sources with radius @xmath198 up to @xmath199 .",
    "this result should be extended for generic configurations probing the space of the source and lens parameters and their relative position .",
    "we expect that the limits here obtained can be connected to the domain of validity for arcs providing guidance to the exploration of this wider parameter space .",
    "the systematic application to arcs and connection to the current results is left for a subsequent work .",
    "it is also important to check whether the criterion established here for the @xmath123 threshold can be applied to other lens models , so that we have an _ a priori _ criterium for the domain of validity of the perturbative approach regardless of the specific model .",
    "the usefulness of the perturbative approach justifies the search for a determination its accuracy and limit of applicability .",
