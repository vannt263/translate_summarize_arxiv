    "the new generation of x - ray satellites ( _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) produces very detailed spectra , thanks to a high spectral resolution combined to a high sensitivity of the spectrometers on board . for the first time , it is possible to have access to x - ray spectroscopy of extra - solar astrophysical objects : e.g. , stellar coronae , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , x - ray binaries , etc .",
    "in particular , observations of seyfert galaxies , show numerous lines of highly ionized elements : predominantly in absorption , for seyfert1 and only in emission for seyfert2 galaxies .",
    "much atomic data have already been calculated to analyze x - ray spectra of solar corona or laboratory plasmas .",
    "the well - known he - like ion diagnostics @xcite , @xcite have been extended from solar to non - solar coronae and also to photoionized plasmas @xcite , @xcite . besides these k - lines , fe - l lines have also been observed in x - ray spectra , for seyfert1 @xcite(fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) , @xcite , @xcite and for seyfert2 @xcite ( fig.[fig : f2 ] ) galaxies . to analyze the unresolved part of the fe - l spectra ( fe@xmath2 to fe@xmath3 ) , atomic data for the transitions from n=2 to n=3 have been calculated and presented as an abbreviated set , assuming a uta ( unresolved transition array ) statistical model @xcite , i.e. mean wavelengths , statistical spectral widths of transition arrays , etc .",
    "the arguments used by the authors to justify statistical treatment is that various processes , such as turbulence , will merge lines into a broad uta , independent of the spectral resolution of the measuring device .",
    "comparisons of the seyfert 1 ngc 3783 spectra with different spectral resolutions ( see tables [ tab : t1 ] ) , xmm @xcite and chandra @xcite ( fig [ fig : f3 ] ) , show that the statistical assumption is not justified at least for this object . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f3 ] , finer detail can be clearly resolved .",
    "indeed , for such a low density plasma the number of possible absorption transitions is quite limited and as the absorption changes dramatically over the ionization stages ( see tables [ tab : t2 ] , [ tab : t3 ] ) the use of a statistical width artificially increases the real width of the lines .",
    "we have therefore re - calculated all the atomic data of @xcite , extending them to n= 4 transitions , giving a particular importance to the numerous possible autoionization channels .",
    "seyfert galaxies , discovered by seyfert @xcite , have very compact and bright centers , the so - called active galactic nuclei ( agn ) : their bolometric luminosities ( i.e. , including all wavelength contributions ) l@xmath410@xmath5 - 10@xmath6l@xmath7 , l@xmath7 being the solar bolometric luminosity .",
    "the surrounding stars are relatively faint compared to the central nucleus .",
    "these galaxies are relatively close to our galaxy exhibiting small red - shifts ( @xmath8 0.05 ) .",
    "seyfert galaxy optical spectra show strong emission lines of ionized gas plus a non - stellar continuum .",
    "the energy power from the galactic nucleus is commonly supposed to be due to some super - massive black hole ( m@xmath9 10@xmath1010@xmath11 m@xmath7 , ( where m@xmath7 is the solar mass ) ) surrounded by an accretion disk ( see fig . [",
    "fig : f4 ] ) .",
    "this disk is observed in emission in all wavelengths from x - ray to infra - red .",
    "there are two types of seyfert galaxies : the seyfert 1 and the seyfert 2 , distinguished by their observed visible spectra .",
    "the seyfert 1 show both broad ( full width at half maximum : fwhm@xmath12200020000kms@xmath13 ) and narrow ( fwhm@xmath14 2000kms@xmath13 ) lines , while seyfert 2 exhibit only narrow lines .",
    "however , antonucci & miller @xcite , in the ngc 1068 seyfert 2 , detected also broad lines using polarimetry .",
    "this led to the conjoncture that seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 are the same type of objects but viewed with different angles .",
    "that is , for seyfert 1 , the observer views the central continuum source which is the `` broad line region '' while , in seyfert 2 , the observer views the external part or the `` narrow line region '' , due to obscuration of the central continuum source by some molecular torus ( see fig . [",
    "fig : f3 ] ) .",
    "this model is supported by the discovery in the x - ray spectrum of a dilute and high ionization medium called the `` warm absorber '' ( discovered by halpern @xcite in mr2251 - 178 ) , mainly observed in absorption in seyfert1 , while only seen in emission in seyfert2 ( e.g. , kinkhabwala et al.@xcite ) .",
    "wavelengths @xmath15 , oscillator strengths @xmath16 and radiative transition probabilities @xmath17 have been calculated using the superstructure code developed at uc london @xcite , which uses a multi - configuration expansion of the wave functions .",
    "the atomic hamiltonian includes most of the breit pauli relativistic corrections ( one - body and two - body terms ) .",
    "the non - relativistic and relativistic eigenstates are obtained by diagonalizing the schrdinger and breit pauli hamiltonian respectively . the matrix transformation between both eigen - states",
    "is then used to transform non - relativistic autoionization transition matrix elements to fine - structure autoionization probabilities @xmath18 , in the autolsj code @xcite .",
    "the radial parts of the one electron wave - functions are calculated in scaled thomas - fermi - dirac potentials , the scaling parameters , for each @xmath19 orbital , being derived by minimizing the energies of some selected ls terms .",
    "calculations have been done for 11 ions from fe@xmath20 to fe@xmath21 using the ground state configuration and the excited configurations accessible by absorption ( i.e. , by electric - dipole transitions ) .",
    "for example :    fe@xmath20 : @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28    and    fe@xmath21 : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .    for fe@xmath20 ,",
    "the excited configurations give bound states .",
    "whereas for fe@xmath34 to fe@xmath21 , the excited configurations correspond to autoionizing states . as examples we provide in tables [ tab : t2 ] , [ tab : t3 ] , the wavelengths , absorption oscillator strengths , radiative and autoionization",
    "probabilities for fe@xmath34 , fe@xmath35 and fe@xmath36 .",
    "one can observe the dramatic increase in the autoionization probabilities from fe@xmath34 to fe@xmath36 .",
    "moreover , the number of possible autoionizing channels increases also dramatically .",
    "this , in particular , explains why one does not observe the emission lines in seyfert2 which could correspond to the absorption lines in seyfert1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] ) .",
    "that is , for l - lines , the photo - excited bound states , fe@xmath37 to fe@xmath20 , decay by the reverse radiative transition whereas the photo - excited autoionizing states , fe@xmath34 to fe@xmath21 , decay preferentially by autoionization .",
    "the optical depth @xmath38 due to an absorption line ( @xmath39 ) can be written as @xmath40 where n@xmath41 is the ionic column density along the line of sight to the source ( in @xmath42 ) and @xmath43 is the photo - excitation cross - section from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .    the photo - excitation ( or photo - absorption ) cross - section is : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath49 is the speed of light , @xmath50 the absorption oscillator strength , and @xmath51 is a normalized line profile .    in fig [",
    "fig : f5 ] , the relative photo - absorption cross - sections of fe@xmath20 to fe@xmath21 are presented with the normalization factor being the same for each graph . if instrumental width is the dominant broadening process of the lines , the same gaussian profile can be used for all lines .",
    "the graph in the lower right is the sum of all the contributions with the assumption that each ion has the same abundance .",
    "the new generation of x - ray satellites ( _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ) provide us with higher resolution spectra than was previously available . for the first time , we have access to high resolution x - ray spectroscopy of non - solar objects . in particular , observations of seyfert 1 galaxies , show very complex spectra with the presence of numerous absorption lines .",
    "accurate atomic data are crucial to infer most of the physical and geometrical parameters of the `` warm absorber '' .",
    "we have calculated complete atomic data sets ( wavelength , oscillator strength , auto - ionization rates ) for inner - shell n=2 - 3 and n=2 - 4 ( mainly 2p3d , 2p4d ) photo - excitation for fe ions ( from 10 electrons to 20 electrons ) . observations in uv , visible and infra - red wavelengths , where those fe ions emit the most , are also important to have a realistic plasma modeling .",
    ".energy ( kev ) and wavelength (  ) ranges , as well as the spectral resolution of the spectrometers aboard the new generation of x - ray satellites : _ chandra _ ( nasa ) and _ xmm - newton _ ( esa ) .",
