    "in recent years the gravitational radiation ( gr ) driven instability in the @xmath0-modes of rotating neutron stars has received considerable interest , both as a source of gravitational waves for detectors such as the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) , and as an astrophysical process capable of limiting the rotation rates of neutron stars . in any rotating star , the @xmath0-modes are driven towards instability by gr @xcite : as the star emits gravity waves ( primarily through a gravitomagnetic effect ) , the gr reaction acts back on the fluid by lowering the ( already negative ) angular momentum of the mode .",

    "suppresses the @xmath0-mode instability , but this may not be the case for hot , rapidly rotating neutron stars @xcite . for neutron stars with millisecond rotation periods , the timescale for the growth of the instability is about 40 s. in the absence of any limiting process , gr would force the dimensionless amplitude of the most unstable ( @xmath1 ) @xmath0-mode to grow to a value of order unity within about ten minutes of the birth of such a star .",
    "( at unit amplitude , the characteristic @xmath0-mode velocities are comparable to the rotational velocity of the star . )    the strength of the gr emitted and the timescale on which the neutron star loses angular momentum and spins down depend critically on the maximum amplitude to which the @xmath0-mode grows .",
    "initial estimates assumed that the amplitude would grow to a value of order unity before an undescribed nonlinear process saturated the mode .",
    "after saturation , it was assumed that the spindown would proceed as a quasi - stationary process , reducing the angular velocity to one tenth of its initial value within about one year . in this scenario",

    "we found that @xmath0-mode saturation intervenes at amplitudes far larger than expected ( @xmath2 ) , supporting the astrophysical relevance of @xmath0-modes and the possibility of detecting @xmath0-mode gravity waves .",
    "the details of the gr signature emitted by the @xmath0-mode instability that we observe in our simulations are rather different than previously envisioned , and these details suggest that this radiation may be more easily detected than previously thought : the radiation is more monochromatic and is emitted in a shorter , more powerful burst ( see ref .",

    "[ fig : k1000delomg ] .",
    "the increase of @xmath40 observed between @xmath245 and @xmath246 is not caused by radiation reaction , but by a global , energy - conservative reorganization of the fluid . at the end of this process",

    "[ fig : fastdelstruct ] ( @xmath247 in run c3 ) with fig .",
    "[ fig : fastdelstructb ] ( @xmath248 in run c4 ) .",
    "the latter plot shows a star that is rotating on cylinders ( except for the outer layer ) , with @xmath249 almost proportional to @xmath37 .     through the extended run c4 .",

    "@xcite derived linearized structure equations for the @xmath0-modes of differentially rotating newtonian stars .",
    "when differential rotation is so strong that _ corotation points _ appear ( that is , when there exists a @xmath37 such that @xmath250 ) , the mode equations go singular .",
    "( the presence of a corotation point at the cylindrical radius @xmath37 means that the velocity pattern of the mode appears to stand still in the frame rotating with angular velocity @xmath251 . ) a comparison of the differential rotation of fig .",
    "[ fig : fastdelstructb ] with the value of @xmath61 suggests the presence of corotation points in the final configuration of our star . by itself , however , the singularity of the linearized mode equations does not necessarily mean that @xmath0-modes are impossible .    , at time @xmath248 .",

    "[ fig : k1000amp ] and figs .  [ fig : k1000omg ] , the growing @xmath0-mode is unable to get locked in phase with the approximate expression for the driving force that we use here . the actual radiation reaction force [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : rrforce ] ) ] is a function of the frequency of the @xmath0-mode .",
    "since we do not know exactly what this frequency is , we use the expression ( [ eq : genomega ] ) to approximate it .",
    "this approximation works extremely well as long as the @xmath0-mode makes the dominant contribution to @xmath33 ; yet , in the turbulent post - spindown environment , the @xmath0-mode no longer dominates the evolution of @xmath24 .",
    "hence , our expression for the gravitational radiation reaction force is no longer correct : it fails to maintain phase coherence with the @xmath0-mode and so prevents the growth of the mode .",
    "if the @xmath0-mode really does not exist in the chaotic post - spindown environment , then it will be necessary to wait for viscosity to damp differential rotation before the @xmath0-mode can grow again",
    ". however , viscosity might be unable to do this before the star cools so much that the @xmath0-mode is stabilized ( either because the star forms a crust or because viscosity itself has grown too strong ) .",
    "this possibility is worrisome , because the same environmental conditions ( strong differential rotation and generalized noise ) that characterize the end of run c4 are likely to occur in the young supernova remnants where @xmath0-modes are expected to arise in nature .",
    "still , we think it more likely that the absence of a second growth episode in our simulation is the result of our expression for the radiation reaction force , which is too simple for this chaotic situation .",
    "we have completed a series of numerical 3d hydrodynamical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the gr driven instability in the @xmath0-modes of rotating neutron stars .",
    "we have verified that the current - quadrupole gr reaction force implemented in our code is accurate by reproducing the analytical predictions ( for slowly rotating stars ) with our full 3d numerical integration code . in our simulations , the amplitude of the ( @xmath1 ) @xmath0-mode",
    "is driven to a value of about three before nonlinear hydrodynamic forces stop its growth by the formation of shocks and breaking surface waves .",
    "we showed that the value of this maximum amplitude is insensitive to the strength of the gr driving force by repeating the simulation for different strengths and different initial fluid configurations .",
    "we also repeated our simulation using a coarser numerical grid to verify the robustness of our results ( the maximum mode amplitude changes only by about 20% when the number of grid points is reduced by a factor of 8) , and to show in particular that numerical viscosity is not playing a critical role in our simulations .",
    "in our simulation we have artificially increased the strength of the gr reaction force in order to reduce the problem to one that can be studied with the available computer resources .",
    "we have shown , however , that the results of our simulation can be used to infer limits on the real physical problem as well .",
    "we used the results of our simulations to derive a lower limit of a few times @xmath252 on the saturation amplitude of the @xmath0-mode in a real neutron star due to possible ( but unseen ) nonlinear mode  mode couplings .",
    "this lower limit applies to couplings with modes that are well described by our simulation : that is , the modes of a barotropic fluid with spatial structures larger than about 2% of the radius of the star .",
    "recent analysis of the effects of magnetic fields  @xcite , and exotic forms of bulk viscosity  @xcite suggest that the @xmath0-mode instability may not play as important a role in astrophysical situations as was once thought .",
    "however , the considerable uncertainty that exists about both the macroscopic and microscopic states of a neutron star makes it impossible at the present time to conclude that the @xmath0-mode instability plays no astrophysical role .",
    "thus it seems reasonable to us that some effort be put into gravitational wave searches for @xmath0-mode signals having forms qualitatively similar to those predicted by simulations such as this .",
