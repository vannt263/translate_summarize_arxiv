    "the problem of inter - cell interference in cellular networks has been the major impediment in delivering a consistent level of quality of service to geographically distributed users with an efficiently high spectral efficiency in terms of bits / sec / hz / user . in a recent attempt to break the interference barrier ,",
    "the information theoretic concept of interference alignment ( ia ) was used .",
    "this concept was initially introduced by maddah - ali _ et .",
    "al _ to solve the mimo @xmath3-channel @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", authors applied the concept of ia to @xmath0-user interference channel ( ic ) and obtained the theoretical upper bound of multiplexing gain or degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "however , the practical development of ia in cellular networks is highly complex , e.g. , an iterative process has been suggested in @xcite to design the transmit and receive beamformers . in this paper , we modify the abstract distributed ia @xcite , by introducing a level of structured coordination amongst the transmitters , i.e. , base - stations ( bss ) , in the cellular network , to improve the achievable spectral efficiency at the cost of a limited overhead of backhaul processing . in our proposed coordination model , each user receives its desired signal from its dedicated bs , as the primary transmitter , and a coordinating bs , as the secondary transmitter . in this chain of coordinated transmissions",
    "the first bs in the network coordinates with the second bs , the second bs coordinates with the third bs and so on , and eventually , the last bs coordinates with the first bs to complete the coordination cycle . in a sense , this transmission model is similar to wyner circular model @xcite,@xcite as each user is supported by two bss , but slightly departs from this model as each user is modeled to receive interference from all the bss in the network .",
    "the coordination link between two bss is uni - directional , e.g. , the first bs shares its channel state information ( csi ) with the second bs and serves as the secondary transmitter to the user of the second bs . as a result , each bs transmits to two users , i.e. , to its own user as the primary transmitter and to the user of the coordinated bs as the secondary transmitter . + through feasibility analysis , we compare the proposed coordination scheme with the generic ia .",
    "we establish some sufficient conditions for obtaining a proper system that can attain a feasible ia solution according to @xcite .",
    "we show that , operating at half of the total available dof , i.e. , the information theoretic upper bound on dof , the generic ia is proper for up to 3-user system , whereas the proposed partially coordinated scheme is proper for up to 5-user system for the same configuration , i.e. , with the same number of transmit / receive antennas and the same number of dof .",
    "then , exploiting the rank deficiency of the interference covariance matrix of the reciprocal uplink channel , we propose an algorithm that implements the ia solution in the proposed coordination model in one shot .",
    "we establish a dof upper bound for obtaining the one shot , i.e. , non - iterative , solution and analyze the system configurations operating below the one shot upper bound .",
    "furthermore , we analyze the backhaul overhead requirement of the proposed coordination model and show that the backhaul overhead in our model increases linearly with increase in the number of participating bss .",
    "simulation results confirm that our proposed scheme improves the sum rate performance compared to the iterative solution in @xcite , for limited usage of the backhaul .",

    "ii , we introduce and formulate the proposed coordination scheme . in section iii ,",
    "we analyze and compare the feasibility of our proposed scheme with the generic ia and introduce a one shot ia solution for the proposed coordination scheme .",
