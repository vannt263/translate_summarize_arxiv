    "in the following , the term ` diffractive electroproduction ' or ` diffractive deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) ' is used to characterize those processes in small-@xmath1 dis where , in spite of the high virtuality of the exchanged photon , the proton target remains intact or almost intact .",
    "thus , the term is used synonymously with the expression ` rapidity gap events in dis ' .",
    "historically , the term diffraction is derived from optics , where it describes the deflection of a beam of light and its decomposition into components with different frequencies . in high energy physics",
    ", it was originally used for small - angle elastic scattering of hadrons ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gwp]a ) .",
    "if one of the hadrons , say the projectile , is transformed into a set of two or more final state particles , the process is called diffractive dissociation or inelastic diffraction .",
    "good and walker have pointed out that a particularly intuitive physical picture of such processes emerges if the projectile is described as a superposition @xmath2 of different components which scatter elastically off the target  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gwp]b ) .",
    "since the corresponding elastic amplitude is different for each component , the outgoing beam will contain a new superposition @xmath3 of these components and therefore , in general , new physical states .",
    "these are the dissociation products of the projectile .",
    "+    [ fig : gwp ] * figure [ fig : gwp ] : * elastic scattering ( a ) and diffractive dissociation ( b ) in the physical picture of good and walker  @xcite .",
    "even at very high energy , the above processes are generically soft , i.e. , the momentum transfer is small and the dissociation products have small @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , no immediate relation to perturbative qcd is apparent .",
    "in contrast to these soft processes , diffractive dis is an example of hard diffraction , the hard scale being the virtuality @xmath5 of the exchanged photon .",
    "however , this is not the first hard diffractive process that was observed .",
    "hard diffraction was first investigated in diffractive jet production at the cern s@xmath6s collider in proton - antiproton collisions  @xcite .",
    "although one of the hadrons escapes essentially unscathed , a high-@xmath4 jet pair , which is necessarily associated with a high virtuality in the intermediate states , is produced in the central rapidity range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : djp ] ) .",
    "the cross section of the process is parametrically unsuppressed relative to non - diffractive jet production .",
    "this seems to contradict a nave partonic picture since the colour neutrality of the projectile is destroyed if one parton is removed to participate in the hard scattering .",
    "the interplay of soft and hard physics necessary to explain the effect provides one of the main motivations for the study of these ` hard diffractive ' processes .",
    "+    [ fig : djp ] * figure [ fig : djp ] : * diffractive dissociation in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "if the diffractive final state @xmath7 contains two high-@xmath4 jets , the process is called diffractive jet production .    here , the focus is on diffractive electroproduction , which is another example of a hard diffractive process .",
    "this process became experimentally viable with the advent of the electron - proton collider hera ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , where dis at very small values of the bjorken variable @xmath1 can be studied . in the small-@xmath1 or high - energy region , a significant fraction of the observed dis events have a large rapidity gap between the photon and the proton fragmentation region  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the standard dis process @xmath8 ( fig .  [ fig : dis]a ) , the relevant reaction reads @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dis]b ) , where @xmath7 is a high - mass hadronic state and @xmath10 is the elastically scattered proton or a low - mass excitation of it .",
    "again , these events are incompatible with the nave picture of a partonic target and corresponding simple ideas about the colour flow .",
    "navely , the parton struck by the virtual photon destroys the colour neutrality of the proton , a colour string forms between struck quark and proton remnant , and hadronic activity is expected throughout the detector . nevertheless , the observed diffractive cross section is not power suppressed at high virtualities @xmath5 with respect to standard dis .",

    "[ vm ] , some topics in diffractive meson production , in particular the factorization of the hard amplitude , are described .",
    "a brief summary is given in sect .",
    "[ sum ] .",
    "the reader may consult  @xcite for a more detailed review .",
    "in this section , the kinematics of diffractive electroproduction at small @xmath1 is explained in some detail , and the notation conventionally used for the description of this phenomenon is introduced .",
    "the main experimental observations are discussed , and the concept of the diffractive structure function , which is widely used in analyses of inclusive diffraction , is explained .      to begin , recall the conventional variables for the description of dis .",
    "an electron with momentum @xmath11 collides with a proton with momentum @xmath12 . in neutral current processes , a photon with momentum @xmath13 and virtuality @xmath14 is exchanged , and the outgoing electron has momentum @xmath15 . in inclusive dis ,",
    "no questions are asked about the hadronic final state @xmath16 , which is only known to have an invariant mass square @xmath17 .",
    "the bjorken variable @xmath18 characterizes , in the nave parton model , the momentum fraction of the incoming proton carried by the quark that is struck by the virtual photon .",
    "if @xmath19 , which is the relevant region in the present context , @xmath20 is much smaller than the photon energy in the target rest frame . in this sense ,",
    "the photon is almost real even though @xmath21 ( where @xmath22 is some soft hadronic scale ) .",
    "it is then convenient to think in terms of a high - energy @xmath23 collision with centre - of - mass energy @xmath24 .    loosely speaking , diffraction is the subset of dis characterized by a quasi - elastic interaction between virtual photon and proton .",
    "a particularly simple definition of diffraction is obtained by demanding that , in the @xmath23 collision , the proton is scattered elastically .",
    "thus , in diffractive events , the final state contains the scattered proton with momentum @xmath25 and a diffractive hadronic state @xmath26 with mass @xmath27 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dep ] ) . since diffractive events form a subset of dis events , the total invariant mass of the outgoing proton and the diffractive state @xmath26 is given by the standard dis variable @xmath24 .",
    "+    [ fig : dep ] * figure [ fig : dep ] : * diffractive electroproduction .",
    "the full hadronic final state with invariant mass @xmath24 contains the elastically scattered proton and the diffractive state with invariant mass @xmath27 .    the following parallel description of inclusive and diffractive dis suggests itself .    in the former , virtual photon and proton",
    "collide to form a hadronic state @xmath16 with mass @xmath24 .",
    "the process can be characterized by the virtuality @xmath5 and the scaling variable @xmath18 , the momentum fraction of the struck quark in the nave parton model .    in the latter",
    ", a colour neutral cluster of partons is stripped off the proton .",
    "the virtual photon forms , together with this cluster , a hadronic state @xmath26 with mass @xmath27 . the process can be characterized by @xmath5 , as above , and by a new scaling variable @xmath28 , the momentum fraction of this cluster carried by the struck quark .",
    "since diffraction is a subprocess of inclusive dis , the struck quark from the colour neutral cluster also carries a fraction @xmath1 of the proton momentum .",
    "therefore , the ratio @xmath29 characterizes the momentum fraction that the proton loses to the colour neutral exchange typical of an elastic reaction .",
    "this exchanged colour neutral cluster loses a momentum fraction @xmath30 to the struck quark that absorbs the virtual photon . as expected , the product @xmath31 is the fraction of the original proton s momentum carried by this struck quark .",
    "since the name pomeron is frequently applied to whichever exchange with vacuum quantum numbers dominates the high - energy limit , many authors use the notation @xmath32 , thus implying that the proton loses a momentum fraction @xmath33 to the exchanged pomeron .    therefore , @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath30 or , alternatively , @xmath1 , @xmath5 and @xmath33 are the main kinematic variables characterizing diffractive dis .",
    "a further variable , @xmath34 , is necessary if the transverse momenta of the outgoing proton and the state @xmath26 relative to the @xmath35 axis are measured .",
    "since the proton is a soft hadronic state , the value of @xmath36 is small in most events .",
    "the small momentum transferred by the proton also implies that @xmath37 .    to see this in more detail ,",
    "introduce light - cone co - ordinates @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is convenient to work in a frame where the transverse momenta of the incoming particles vanish , @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the momentum transferred by the proton , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 the proton mass squared .",
    "for forward scattering , @xmath44 , the relation t=^2=_+ _ -=-^2m_^2 holds .",
    "since @xmath45 , this means that small @xmath27 implies small @xmath36 and vice versa .",
    "note , however , that the value of @xmath36 is larger for non - forward processes , where @xmath46 .",
    "so far , diffractive events have been characterized as those dis events which contain an elastically scattered proton in their hadronic final state .",
    "an even more striking feature is the large gap of hadronic activity seen in the detector between the scattered proton and the diffractive state @xmath26 .",
    "it will now be demonstrated that this feature , responsible for the alternative name ` rapidity gap events ' , is a direct consequence of the relevant kinematics .",
    "recall the definition of the rapidity @xmath47 of a particle with momentum @xmath11 , y==. this is a convenient quantity for the description of high - energy collisions along the @xmath48-axis .",
    "massless particles moving along this axis have rapidity @xmath49 or @xmath50 , while all other particles are characterized by some finite intermediate value of @xmath47 .    in the centre - of - mass frame of the @xmath23 collision , with the @xmath48-axis pointing in the proton beam direction ,",
    "the rapidity of the incoming proton is given by @xmath51 . at small @xmath33 ,",
    "the rapidity of the scattered proton is approximately the same .",
    "this is to be compared with the highest rapidity @xmath52 of any of the particles in the diffractive state @xmath26 . since the total plus component of the 4-momentum of @xmath26 is given by @xmath53 , and the pion , with mass @xmath54 ,",
    "is the lightest hadron , none of the particles in @xmath26 can have a rapidity above @xmath55 .",
    "thus , a rapidity gap of size @xmath56 exists between the outgoing proton and the state @xmath26 . for typical values of @xmath57",
    "the size of this gap can be considerable .",
    "note , however , that the term ` rapidity gap events ' was coined to describe the appearance of diffractive events in the hera frame , i.e. , a frame defined by the electron - proton collision axis . the rapidity in this frame is , in general , different from the photon - proton frame rapidity discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a gap surrounding the outgoing proton in the @xmath23 frame clearly implies the existence of a similar gap in the @xmath58 frame .",
    "the exact size of the @xmath58-frame rapidity gap follows from the specific event kinematics .",
    "the main conclusion so far is the kinematic separation of outgoing proton and diffractive state @xmath26 in diffractive events with small @xmath33 .    without losing any of the qualitative results , the requirement of a final state proton @xmath25",
    "can be replaced by the requirement of a low - mass hadronic state @xmath10 , well separated from the diffractive state @xmath26 . in this case , the argument connecting elastically scattered proton and rapidity gap has to be reversed : the existence of a gap between @xmath26 and @xmath10 becomes the distinctive feature of diffraction and , under certain kinematic conditions , the interpretation of @xmath10 as an excitation of the incoming proton , which is now _ almost _ elastically scattered , follows .",
    "rapidity gaps are expected even if in all dis events a quark is knocked out of the proton leaving a coloured remnant .",
    "the reason for this is the statistical distribution of the produced hadrons , which results in a small yet finite probability for final states with little activity in any specified detector region .",
    "however , the observations described below are clearly inconsistent with this explanation of rapidity gap events .",
    "more than 5% of dis events at hera were found to possess a rapidity gap  @xcite .",
    "the analyses are based on the pseudo - rapidity @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the angle of an outgoing particle relative to the beam axis .",
    "pseudo - rapidity and rapidity are identical for massless particles ; the difference between these two quantities is immaterial for the qualitative discussion below .    in the zeus analysis ,",
    "a rapidity @xmath61 was defined as the maximum rapidity of a calorimeter cluster in an event .",
    "a cluster was defined as an isolated set of adjacent cells with summed energy higher than 400 mev . the measured @xmath61 distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeus ] .",
    "( note that the smallest detector angle corresponds to @xmath62 ; larger values are an artifact of the clustering algorithm . )",
    "+    [ fig : zeus ] * figure [ fig : zeus ] : * distribution of @xmath61 , the maximum rapidity of a calorimeter cluster in an event , measured at hera ( figure from  @xcite ) .    to appreciate the striking qualitative signal of diffraction at hera",
    ", the measured @xmath61 distribution has to be compared with nave expectations based on a purely partonic picture of the proton .",
    "this is best done using a parton - model - based monte carlo event generator .",
    "the corresponding @xmath61 distribution , which is also shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : zeus ] , is strongly suppressed at small @xmath61 .",
    "this qualitative behaviour is expected since the monte carlo ( for more details see  @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) starts from a partonic proton , calculates the hard process and the perturbative evolution of the qcd cascade , and finally models the hadronization using the lund string model ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "according to the lund model , the colour string , which connects all final state partons and the coloured proton remnant , breaks up via @xmath63 pair creation , thus producing the observed mesons .",
    "the rapidities of these particles follow a poisson distribution , resulting in an exponential suppression of large gaps",
    ".    it should be clear from the above discussion that this result is rather general and does not depend on the details of the monte carlo ( note , however , the monte carlo based approach of  @xcite , which allows for colour reconnection ) .",
    "qcd radiation tends to fill the rapidity range between the initially struck quark and the coloured proton remnant with partons .",
    "a colour string connecting these partons is formed , and it is highly unlikely that a large gap emerges in the final state after the break - up of this string .",
    "however , the data shows a very different behaviour .",
    "the expected exponential decrease of the event number with @xmath61 is observed only above @xmath64 ; below this value a large plateau is seen .",
    "thus , the nave partonic description of dis misses an essential qualitative feature of the data , namely , the existence of non - suppressed large rapidity gap events .    to give a more specific discussion of the diffractive event sample , it is necessary to define which events are to be called diffractive or rapidity gap events .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : zeus ] that , on a qualitative level , this can be achieved by an @xmath61 cut separating the events of the plateau .",
    "the resulting qualitative features , observed both by the zeus  @xcite and h1 collaborations  @xcite , are the following .",
    "there exists a large rapidity interval where the @xmath61 distribution is flat . for high @xmath23 energies @xmath24 ,",
    "the ratio of diffractive events to all dis events is approximately independent of @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath5 dependence of this ratio is also weak , suggesting a leading - twist contribution of diffraction to dis .",
    "furthermore , the diffractive mass spectrum is consistent with a @xmath65 distribution .",
    "a number of additional remarks are in order .",
    "note first that the observation of a flat @xmath61 distribution and of a @xmath65 spectrum are interdependent as long as masses and transverse momenta of final state particles are much smaller than @xmath66 . to see this ,",
    "observe that the plus component of the most forward particle momentum and the minus component of the most backward particle momentum are largely responsible for the total invariant mass of the diffractive final state .",
    "this gives rise to the relation @xmath67 , which is equivalent to the desired result .",
    "a significant contribution from exclusive vector meson production , e.g. , the process @xmath68 , is present in the rapidity gap event sample . a more detailed discussion of corresponding cross sections and of relevant theoretical considerations is given in sect .  [ vm ] .",
    "the diffractive structure function , introduced in  @xcite and first measured by the h1 collaboration  @xcite , is a powerful concept for the analysis of data on diffractive dis .",
    "recall the relevant formulae for inclusive dis .",
    "the cross section for the process @xmath69 can be calculated if the hadronic tensor , w_(p , q)=_x",
    "< p|j_^(0)|x><x|j_(0)|p > ( 2)^4 ^ 4(q+p - p_x ) , is known . here",
    "@xmath70 is the electromagnetic current , and the sum is over all hadronic final states @xmath7 .",
    "because of current conservation , @xmath71 , the tensor can be decomposed according to w_(p , q)=(g_- ) w_1(x , q^2)+(p_+q_)(p_+ q_)w_2(x , q^2).[dec ] the data is conveniently analysed in terms of the two structure functions f_2(x ,",
    "q^2)&=&(pq)w_2(x , q^2 ) + f_l(x , q^2)&=&(pq)w_2(x , q^2)-2xw_1(x , q^2 ) . introducing the ratio @xmath72 , the electron - proton cross section can be written as = \\{1-y+ } f_2(x , q^2 ) , where @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is the electron - proton centre - of - mass energy squared . in the nave parton model or at",
    "leading order in @xmath75 in qcd , the longitudinal structure function @xmath76 vanishes , and @xmath77 . since @xmath78 corresponds to the ratio of longitudinal and transverse virtual photon cross sections , @xmath79 , it is always positive , and the corrections associated with a non - zero @xmath78 are small at low values of @xmath47 .    in diffraction , the two additional kinematic variables @xmath33 and @xmath80 are present .",
    "however , no additional independent 4-vector is introduced as long as the measurement is inclusive with respect to the azimuthal angle of the scattered proton .",
    "therefore , the decomposition in eq .",
    "( [ dec ] ) remains valid , and the two diffractive structure functions @xmath81 can be defined .",
    "the diffractive cross section reads = \\{1-y+ } f_2^d(4)(x , q^2,,t),[d4s ] where @xmath82 . in view of the limited precision of the data , the dominance of the small-@xmath47 region , and the theoretical expectation of the smallness of @xmath83 , the corrections associated with a non - zero value of @xmath84 are neglected in the following .",
    "a more inclusive and experimentally more easily accessible quantity can be defined by performing the @xmath80 integration , f_2^d(3)(x , q^2,)=dt f_2^d(4)(x , q^2,,t ) .",
    "the main qualitative features of diffractive electroproduction , already discussed in the previous section , become particularly apparent if the functional form of @xmath85 is considered ( cf . the data in figs .",
    "[ h1 ] and [ zeus ] in sect .",
    "[ f2th ] ) .",
    "the @xmath30 and @xmath5 dependence of @xmath85 is relatively flat .",
    "this corresponds to the observations discussed earlier that diffraction is a leading twist effect and that the mass distribution is consistent with a @xmath86 spectrum .",
    "the energy dependence of diffraction is such that @xmath87 slowly grows as @xmath88 .",
    "this growth and its possible relation to the growth of inclusive structure functions at small @xmath1 and to the growth of elastic cross sections at high energy is one of the most interesting aspects of diffraction ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "to understand qualitatively how leading twist diffraction in dis comes about , it is simplest to work in the target rest frame .",
    "diffraction means that a hadronic fluctuation of the energetic virtual photon scatters off the target proton without exchanging colour .",
    "one can then expect the photon and the proton to fragment independently , leading to a rapidity gap event .",
    "a particularly simple physical picture is provided by the aligned jet model of bjorken and kogut  @xcite . in terms of the qcd degrees of freedom ,",
    "a closely related formulation of diffraction was given with the two - gluon exchange calculations of nikolaev and zakharov  @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath80 channel colour singlet exchange is not hard in the bulk of the cross section underlying @xmath0 , the exchange of more than two gluons is not suppressed .",
    "this can be systematically treated in the semiclassical approach  @xcite .    in the breit frame , where the target proton is fast , diffraction was historically described as dis off a pomeron  @xcite .",
    "a more general , qcd based concept treating diffraction from a breit frame point of view are the diffractive parton distributions  @xcite . as will be discussed in more detail below , the semiclassical approach provides a convenient framework in which one can intuitively understand how diffractive parton distributions emerge in a target rest calculation .",
    "a very simple argument why , even at very high photon virtualities , diffractive dis is largely a soft process was presented by bjorken and kogut in the framework of their aligned jet model  @xcite .",
    "the underlying physical picture is based on vector meson dominance ideas .",
    "the incoming photon fluctuates into a hadronic state with mass @xmath27 , which then collides with the target ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ajm]a ) .",
    "the corresponding cross section for transverse photon polarization is estimated by ~(m^2 ) , where the probability for the photon to develop a fluctuation with mass @xmath27 is given by dp(m^2)~ , and @xmath89 is the cross section for this fluctuation to scatter off the target .",
    "the above expression for @xmath90 is most easily motivated in the framework of old - fashioned perturbation theory , where the energy denominator of the amplitude is proportional to the off - shellness of the hadronic fluctuation , @xmath91 . if this is the only source for a @xmath5 dependence , the numerator factor @xmath66 is necessary to obtain a dimensionless expression .",
    "+    [ fig : ajm ] * figure [ fig : ajm ] : * vector meson dominance inspired picture of inclusive ( a ) and diffractive ( b ) electroproduction .",
    "bjorken and kogut assume that , for large @xmath66 , the intermediate hadronic state typically contains two jets and that @xmath89 is suppressed for configurations with high @xmath4 ( the latter effect being now known under the name of colour transparency ) .",
    "consider hadronic fluctuations with a certain @xmath66 , which , in their respective rest frames , are realized by two back - to - back jets . under the assumption that the probability distribution of the direction of the jet axis is isotropic , simple geometry implies that aligned configurations , defined by @xmath92 ( where @xmath93 is a soft hadronic scale ) , are suppressed by @xmath94 . if only such configurations are absorbed with a large , hadronic cross section , the relations @xmath95 and ~[ajm ] follow .",
    "thus , the above cross section can be interpreted as the total high - energy cross section of target proton and aligned jet fluctuation of the photon , i.e. , of two soft hadronic objects .",
    "therefore , a similar elastic cross section is expected , @xmath96 ( cf . fig .  [",
    "fig : ajm]b ) .",
    "the resulting diffractive structure function reads f_2^d(3)(,,q^2)~/.[ajmf2d ]    it is interesting that the very simple arguments outlined above capture two important features of the hera data : the leading - twist nature of diffraction and the approximate @xmath97 behaviour of @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest way to formulate the above intuitive picture , where a hadronic fluctuation of the photon scatters off the proton , in perturbative qcd is via two - gluon exchange . at leading order ,",
    "the photon fluctuates in a @xmath63 pair and two gluons forming a colour singlet are exchanged in the @xmath80 channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gg ] ) .",
    "a corresponding calculation was first performed by nikolaev and zakharov  @xcite , where the probability for the photon to fluctuate in a @xmath63 pair was described by the square of the light - cone wave function of the photon .",

    ", the corresponding calculations will not be described ( see , however , the recent review of diffraction  @xcite emphasizing two - gluon exchange ) .",

    "the main shortcoming of the two - gluon approach is the lacking justification of perturbation theory .",
    "as should be clear from the aligned jet model and as will be discussed in a more technical way below , the diffractive kinematics is such that the @xmath80 channel colour singlet exchange does not feel the hard scale of the initial photon .",
    "thus , more than two gluons can be exchanged without suppression by powers of @xmath75 .",
    "note that this is different in certain more exclusive processes , such as vector meson production , where it has been shown that the dynamics of the @xmath80 channel exchange is governed by a hard , perturbative scale ( cf .",

    "the discussion of vector meson production given so far was limited to the double - leading - log approximation as far as the colour singlet exchange in the @xmath80 channel is concerned . to go beyond this approximation , the concept of ` non - forward ' or ` off - diagonal ' parton distributions , introduced some time ago ( see  @xcite and refs . therein ) and discussed by ji  @xcite and radyushkin  @xcite in the present context , has to be used ( see also  @xcite ) .",

    "having discussed the leading order results for vector meson production , the next logical step is to ask whether the systematic calculation of higher order corrections is feasible . for this , it is necessary to understand the factorization properties of the hard amplitude and the two non - perturbative objects involved , i.e. , the meson wave function and the non - forward gluon distribution .",

    "the complete result contains leading contributions from diagrams that can not be factorized into quark - pair production and meson formation .",
    "however , the answer to the calculation can be anticipated by looking only at one particular factorizing diagram .",
    "the reason for this simplification is gauge invariance . in the dominant region , where the transverse momentum @xmath248 of the two @xmath80-channel gluons is small",
    ", gauge invariance requires the complete quark part of the amplitude to be proportional to @xmath253 .",

    "note finally that , although qcd predicts factorization for longitudinal vector meson production and a @xmath145 suppression of the transverse cross section , this behaviour is not visible in the data  @xcite . a recent calculation  @xcite explaining the data is , in my opinion , in conflict with qcd expectations and , in particular , with the implications of  @xcite , since it employs a non - local vector meson vertex in a loop calculation .",
    "it is important to clarify this situation .",
    "the phenomenon of diffraction in dis can be understood in very simple terms if the process is viewed in the rest frame of the target proton .",
    "the energetic virtual photon develops a partonic fluctuation which then scatters off the target .",
    "a certain fraction of the total dis cross section is due to photon fluctuations with large transverse size .",
    "this fraction is not power suppressed in the high-@xmath5 limit . since",
    ", as one expects from the experience with hadron - hadron collisions , part of these large size fluctuations scatter quasi - elastically off the proton , a leading twist diffractive cross section is obtained .",
    "one possibility to describe the interaction of the photon fluctuation with the target is two - gluon exchange . in certain more exclusive processes , such as longitudinally polarized vector meson production ,",
    "the transverse size of the relevant photon fluctuations is always small and two - gluon calculations can be rigorously justified . however , for most of the diffractive cross section no suppression of multiple gluon exchange can be derived .",
    "this problem is addressed in the semiclassical approach , where the target is described by a superposition of soft colour fields and gluon exchange is resummed to all orders in an eikonal approximation .",
    "diffraction arises whenever the partonic fluctuation of the photon remains in a colour singlet .",
    "the application of the semiclassical approach to experimental results is particularly simple if the approach is used to derive both diffractive and inclusive parton distributions at some small input scale . in this case",
