    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are transient ejections into interplanetary space of as much as about 10@xmath410@xmath5 g of plasma and embedded magnetic fields from the solar corona @xcite .",
    "there have been many studies to understand cme initiation with several numerical simulation models .",
    "@xcite showed in their simulation that a cme can be triggered by the localized reconnection between a pre - existing coronal field and a reconnection - favored emerging magnetic flux system with some observational supports ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , in agreement with some observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggested that flux cancellation at the neutral line of a sheared arcade can lead to the formation , destabilization , and eruption of a filament followed by a cme .",
    "@xcite proposed a model ( so - called breakout model ) in which the reconnection of a sheared arcade with an overlying background magnetic field gradually removes a constraint over the sheared arcade so that a cme can occur . a kink instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) by an emergence of a twisted flux tube were also considered to explain the initiation of cmes , e.g. , @xcite performed isothermal mhd simulations of the three - dimensional evolution of coronal magnetic fields as a twisted magnetic flux tube emerges gradually into a pre - existing coronal arcade . in addition , there are some other trigger mechanisms : a shear ( or twist ) motion of footpoints of magnetic arcades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , slow decay of a background magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a buoyancy force due to filament mass drainage ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and moreton & eit waves generated by a remote cme ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , a precondition and a trigger mechanism for cme initiation has not been understood clearly yet .",
    "more observational studies are needed to determine and/or suggest a most convincing model which can explain the detailed processes of cme occurrence .",
    "after cmes are initiated at the corona , they depart from the sun at speeds ranging from @xmath120 to more than 3000@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 ( average speed of 480@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 ) measured from the @xmath0/lasco white - light images during solar cycle 23 @xcite .",
    "to understand how cme speed is associated with magnetic properties in cme - productive active regions , there have been some studies to find a relationship between cme speed and several magnetic parameters derived from photospheric magnetic fields .",
    "@xcite studied 13 cme events and found that there is a strong correlation between cme speed and total reconnection flux ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) estimated from photospheric magnetic fields with a linear correlation coefficient ( cc ) of 0.89 .",
    "@xcite examined properties of photospheric line - of - sight magnetic fields in 55 active regions before the onset times of 86 cmes originating from the investigated active regions .",
    "they measured four magnetic parameters in the active regions ( i.e. , tilt angle , total flux , total length of strong - field strong - gradient neutral lines , and effective distance ) and found a moderate correlation between cme speed and effective distance with a linear cc of @xmath10.4 .",
    "magnetic helicity has been recognized as a quantitative and useful measure for global complexity and non - potentiality of a given magnetic field system in terms of twists , kinks , and inter - linkages of magnetic field lines @xcite .",

    ", @xcite found that the filament has a helically twisted configuration ( shown by a trace 171  image ) and there is a steady magnetic helicity injection of 2@xmath610@xmath7mx@xmath8 from the photosphere of the active region into the corona over a time span of @xmath128 hours around the times of four eruptive events involved in the filament . from the study of 34 pairs of cmes and magnetic clouds ( mc )",
    ", @xcite showed that the square of cme speed is positively correlated with magnetic helicity per unit length in the corresponding mc at 1 au .",
    "@xcite investigated the temporal variation of photospheric magnetic helicity injection in 10 active regions which produced 12 halo cmes .",
    "they found that there is no unique trend of a short - term ( several hours ) variation of magnetic helicity injection before and after cme occurrence even though a rapid and large change of magnetic helicity injection was observed in some cases .",
    "recently , @xcite examined a filament eruption in the active region noaa 9682 and reported that the filament eruption may be caused by the interaction of two magnetic field systems with opposite signs of magnetic helicity .    in this study , long - term variation ( a few days ) of magnetic helicity injection is investigated for 28 active regions which produced 47 cmes .",
    "the goals of this study are : ( 1 ) to find a characteristic variation pattern of helicity injection in relation to a pre - cme condition and a cme energy build - up process and ( 2 ) to carry out a correlation study between cme speed and helicity injection rate in the active regions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : data selection and analysis are explained in section  [ sec2 ] . in section  [ sec3 ] , we first describe in detail the observational finding of two cme groups classified by two characteristic evolution patterns of helicity injection and their different cme characteristics (   [ sec3:sub1 ] ) , then the relationship of cme speed with helicity injection rate for the two cme groups is presented (   [ sec3:sub2 ] ) . finally , we discuss in section  [ sec4 ] that the two helicity patterns can be interpreted by some numerical simulation models for cme initiation .",
    "for a statistical study of magnetic helicity injection in active regions related to cmes , we selected 28 active regions which produced 47 cmes ( refer to table  [ sec2:tab1 ] for the detailed information of the cme events ) . out of total 47 cmes ,",
    "42 cmes were adopted from the cme list of @xcite in which the cmes are identified with their originating active regions .",
    "we carefully checked the identification of the cme source regions by investigating not only the cme position angles with respect to their source regions but also cme - related phenomena in the source regions such as soft x - ray flares , eit brightenings / dimmings , erupting filaments , or post - flare arcades .",

    "the injection rate of helicity @xmath9 through the photospheric surface @xmath10 of the cme - productive active regions at a specific time @xmath11 is calculated from the method developed by @xcite : @xmath12 where the integrand @xmath13 = @xmath14b_{n}(\\textit{\\textbf{x}},t)$ ] is a good proxy of helicity flux density ( i.e. , helicity injection per unit area per unit time ) at a point @xmath15 on @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite found that the relative standard deviation of @xmath9 calculated from the same method as used in this study is around 5@xmath31 .",
    "we therefore think that the uncertainty of @xmath29 does not significantly affect the helicity calculation and conclusion of this study .",
    "after @xmath9 is determined as a function of time , the accumulated amount of helicity injection @xmath32 in the cme - productive active regions is determined by integrating @xmath9 with respect to time : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the start time of each mdi magnetogram data set of the active region under investigation .",

    "we have investigated helicity injection through the photospheric surface of 28 solar active regions over a span of several days around the times of 47 cmes which originated from the active regions . as a result , it was found that all the cmes under investigation are always preceded by a significant helicity injection of 10@xmath3710@xmath38mx@xmath8 over a long period ( @xmath10.54.5 days ) into the active - region corona through the photosphere .",

    "* ) , a filament eruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and halo cmes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , we found that there are two characteristic patterns in the long - term ( a few days ) variation of helicity injection in the cme - productive active regions which appeared for a few days before the cme occurrence : ( 1 ) a monotonically increasing pattern with one sign of helicity ( group a ; 30 cmes in 23 active regions ) and ( 2 ) a pattern of significant helicity injection followed by its sign reversal ( group b ; 17 cmes in 5 active regions ) .",
    "figures  [ sec3:sub1:fig1 ] ,  [ sec3:sub1:fig2 ] , and  [ sec3:sub1:fig3 ] present the time profiles of @xmath32 calculated for the 23 active regions in group a. as shown in the time profiles , each of the 30 cmes in group a was preceded by a large injection of one sign of helicity .",
    "more specifically , the absolute value of @xmath32 significantly increased at a nearly constant rate , ( 0.3110)@xmath610@xmath39mx@xmath40hr@xmath3 , over about 0.54.5 days and then 26 out of the 30 cmes occurred during the monotonically increasing phase .",
    "the other 4 cmes in group a occurred when the helicity increasing rate becomes much smaller ( almost zero ) after the monotonically increasing phase , and they are marked with the superscript ` @xmath41 ' in table  [ sec2:tab1 ] . on the other hands , the time variations of @xmath32 for the 5 active regions in group b",
    "are shown in figure  [ sec3:sub1:fig4 ] .",
    "the source regions producing 17 cmes in group b presented a sign change of @xmath9 before the cmes : i.e. , a noticeable increase in helicity of one sign was present for a while ( 645 hours ) and then the cmes occurred while relatively more helicity with the opposite sign was being injected in their source regions for the next few days .",
    "the main difference between group a and group b in the temporal variation of helicity injection is that the helicity sign reversal phase appears in group b , but not in group a. note that we made the criterion for the helicity sign reversal shown in group b as @xmath32 changes greater than 10@xmath42mx@xmath8 before and after the sign reversal phase starts . in the case that a sign change of @xmath9 appeared but the criterion was not satisfied , we considered the variation of @xmath32 as fluctuation during the monotonically increasing phase of helicity injection shown in the active regions noaa 8097 , 8100 , and 8693 of group a.    we have also examined whether or not there is a specific trend in the temporal variation of @xmath35 in the cme source active regions during the period of the two characteristic helicity patterns shown in group a and group b. for doing that , from the time profiles of @xmath35 shown in figures  [ sec3:sub1:fig1 ] ,  [ sec3:sub1:fig2 ] ,  [ sec3:sub1:fig3 ] , and  [ sec3:sub1:fig4 ] , we calculated @xmath43 that is the average change rate of the total unsigned magnetic flux during the time period @xmath44 between @xmath45 and the cme occurrence time @xmath46 in the active region under investigation : @xmath47}{\\delta\\tau}.\\ ] ] in the case of the 30 cmes in group a , 19 cmes ( 63@xmath31 ) were preceded by an increase in @xmath35 ; i.e. , @xmath43 @xmath48 0 .",
    "however , the other 11 cmes ( 37@xmath31 ) were preceded by a decrease in @xmath35 ; i.e. , @xmath43 @xmath49 0 .",
    "for the 17 cmes in group b , 13 cmes ( 76@xmath31 ) occurred after an increase in @xmath35 , while 4 cmes ( 24@xmath31 ) after a decrease in @xmath35 .",
    "refer to tables  [ sec3:sub2:tab1 ] and  [ sec3:sub2:tab2 ] for the detailed values of @xmath50 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 of each event in group a and group b. we found that an increasing trend of @xmath35 before the occurrence of the cmes is more common than a decreasing trend and this is more apparently shown in group b than group a.    now it would be interesting to know whether cme characteristics are different according to the two different patterns of helicity injection in the cme source regions .",
    "we therefore investigated a difference in the speed , acceleration , and occurrence trend of the cmes between group a and group b. the cme speed and acceleration were adopted from the lasco cme catalog ( http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme_list ) .",
    "the linear speed in the catalog was taken as the representative cme speed in this study , which was determined from linear fit ( also known as constant speed fit ) to the height - time measurement of each of the cmes within the lasco c2 and c3 field of view ( 1.530 solar radii from the solar surface ) .",
    "the cme acceleration was also estimated from the height - time measurement using second - order polynomial fit .",
    "note that there is a large uncertainty in some cases of the cme acceleration measurement with just three points in the height - time plot and they are marked with the superscript ` @xmath51 ' in table  [ sec2:tab1 ] .",
    "we found that the cmes in group a have the speed range of 2502460@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 with the average(median ) speed of 870(700)@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 while those in group b have the speed range of 5002860@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 with the average(median ) speed of 1330(1150 ) km@xmath2s@xmath3 .",
    "the average cme speed of group b is about 450@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 faster than that of group a. there is also a significant difference in the cme acceleration between group a and group b : the average acceleration is -24.4@xmath2m@xmath2s@xmath52 and -6.3@xmath2m@xmath2s@xmath52 , respectively for group a and group b. these facts indicate that the cmes in group a have a relatively slow speed and rapid deceleration compared to those in group b. furthermore , the cmes in group a mainly consist of single events , while those in group b tend to be successive events ; i.e. , 18 out of the total 23 active regions in group a produced only one cme event during the helicity measurement period , while each of the total 5 active regions in group b generated at least two cmes .",
    "we examined soft x - ray characteristics of the cme - related flares in group a and group b using the 18  @xmath53 data .",
    "both groups have a similar average flare duration , but they show a difference in total integrated flux @xmath54 and flare impulsiveness @xmath55 ( i.e. , peak flux / flare rise time ; refer to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the average @xmath54 ( 10@xmath56w@xmath2m@xmath57min@xmath3 ) is 1.5 and 2.3 and the average @xmath55 ( 10@xmath56w@xmath2m@xmath57min@xmath3 ) is 0.7 and 1.1 , respectively for group a and group b. this indicates that the cme - related flares in group b are relatively more energetic and impulsive than those in group a. in table  [ sec3:sub1:tab1 ] , the differences between group a and group b are summarized .      from the time profile of @xmath9 ,",
    "a helicity parameter is defined to investigate its relationship with cme speed .",
    "we use the average helicity injection rate @xmath58 which indicates the average amount of injected helicity per unit time into @xmath10 during the time period @xmath44 between @xmath45 and @xmath46 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the total number of data points during @xmath44 . note that as a reference parameter , we consider @xmath50 , i.e. , the total unsigned magnetic flux at @xmath46 : @xmath61    the two parameters @xmath58 and @xmath50 were calculated for the source regions producing the 47 cmes under investigation , and they were compared with the cme speed @xmath62 as shown in figure  [ sec3:sub2:fig1 ] .",
    "the red and blue solid lines indicate the least - squares linear fits to the data points of group a ( red triangles ) and group b ( blue diamonds ) in each panel , respectively . the slope , intercept , and cc of the linear fits are also given in each panel . for group",
    "a , we found that @xmath62 has a very strong correlation ( cc=0.85 ) with @xmath58 , as well as a good correlation ( cc=0.79 ) with @xmath50 . in case of group b",
    ", @xmath62 has a moderate correlation ( cc=0.63 ) with @xmath58 , while its correlation with @xmath50 is weak ( cc=0.45 ) .",
    "this is because there is a high correlation ( cc=0.83 ) between @xmath58 and @xmath50 for group a ( see figure  [ sec3:sub2:fig2]a ) as previously reported that there is a good correlation between helicity injection and total unsigned magnetic flux in active regions @xcite , but a poor correlation ( cc=0.23 ) for group b ( as shown in figure  [ sec3:sub2:fig2]b ) .",
    "note that the correlations between @xmath62 and @xmath58 for both group a and group b are statistically highly significant with @xmath48 99@xmath31 confidence level ( from a two - tailed student s t - test ) .",
    "in addition , we found that the linear fits to the data points of @xmath62 ( km@xmath2s@xmath3 ) vs. @xmath58 ( 10@xmath39mx@xmath40hr@xmath3 ) are significantly different between group a and group b : i.e. , @xmath62=14@xmath58 + 440 for group a and @xmath62=128@xmath58 + 700 for group b. the slope of the linear fitted line for group b is about nine times greater than that for group a , and the intercept of the fitted line for group b is @xmath1250 km / s greater than that for group a.    we now have a question why there are considerable correlations between the helicity parameter and the cme speed with a tendency that the lager injection of helicity a cme - productive active region achieves , the faster cme it produces .",
    "one possible answer for the question is as follows : the speed of cmes depends on how much energy cmes have , and the cme kinetic energy is supposed to be originated from free magnetic energy which is the energy deviation of the coronal magnetic field from its potential state .",
    "assuming linear force - free magnetic fields , @xcite showed that there is linear dependence between free magnetic energy and relative magnetic helicity from the total magnetic energy formula given by @xcite . in the study of @xcite , it was also found that there is a correlation between free magnetic energy and relative magnetic helicity estimated from reconstructed nonlinear force - free magnetic fields in four active regions even though the number of the active region samples is too small .",
    "therefore , it might be reasonable to consider that helicity injection through the photosphere in a cme - productive active region is closely related to free magnetic energy build - up in the active - region corona for cme kinetic energy .",
    "47 cme events are examined to find a characteristic evolution pattern of helicity injection during a few days in their 28 source active regions .",
    "the main findings in this study are as follows : ( 1 ) there is always a significant helicity injection of 10@xmath3710@xmath38mx@xmath8 through the active - region photosphere over a few days before the cmes ; ( 2 ) the cmes under investigation are categorized into two different groups by two different helicity patterns which appeared for @xmath10.54.5 before their occurrence .",
    "30 cmes in group a occurred in 23 active regions in which monotonically increasing pattern with one sign of helicity injection is presented , whereas 5 active regions producing 17 cmes in group b show a pattern of significant helicity injection followed by its sign reversal ; and ( 3 ) the correlation between cme speed @xmath62 and average helicity injection rate @xmath58 in the cme - productive active regions is significant ( cc=0.85 ) for group a and moderate ( cc=0.63 ) for group b.    in addition , the two cme groups classified by the two characteristic evolution patterns of helicity injection show different characteristics in kinematics , occurrence rate in a single active region , cme - related flare properties , and magnetic properties of their source regions as follows : ( 1 ) the average cme speed of group b ( 1330@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 ) is much faster than that of group a ( 870@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 ) and the cmes in group b ( -6.3@xmath2m@xmath2s@xmath52 ) have a relatively slow deceleration compared to those in group a ( -24.4@xmath2m@xmath2s@xmath52 ) ; ( 2 ) a linear fit of @xmath62 vs. @xmath58 is quite different between group a and group b ; ( 3 ) the cmes in group a tend to be single events , while those in group b are inclined to be successive events ; ( 4 ) soft x - ray flares related to the cmes in group b are relatively more energetic and impulsive than those in group a ; and ( 5 ) an increasing trend of magnetic flux in the cme source regions is more commonly shown in group b than group a.    these differences may suggest that there are different pre - cme conditions for the two groups related to the two characteristic helicity patterns .",
    "we therefore try to understand how the two helicity patterns are involve with a precondition for cme initiation by comparing them with temporal variations of helicity injection which are calculated or expected from some numerical cme models .",
    "first , emerging twisted flux rope models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be considered to explain the characteristic variation pattern of @xmath32 shown in group a ( i.e. , the monotonically increasing pattern with one sign of helicity ) .",
    "@xcite showed in their numerical mhd simulation that as a twisted flux tube emerges gradually into a pre - existing coronal arcade during a pre - cme phase , the flux tube s helicity is continuously transported through the photosphere boundary into the corona .",
    "so we can verify that the time variation of photospheric helicity injection in the simulation is very similar to that in group a ( refer to figure 3c in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition , the numerical simulations of @xcite and @xcite indicated that ( 1 ) an emerging flux tube can settle into a phase of a steady quasi - static rise after the emergence of the flux tube is slowed down or stopped and ( 2 ) the quasi - static rising phase can be sustained for several hours until it erupts as a cme .",
    "we therefore conjecture that the phase of the nearly constant @xmath32 which appeared for several hours before the onset time of the 4 cmes in group a may be related to the quasi - static stage .",
    "second , some cme models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which contain pre - cme dynamics associated with a steady shear ( or twist ) motion of magnetic field line footpoints on the photosphere can also explain the monotonically increasing pattern in group a. in this case , magnetic flux emergence at the photosphere is not necessary to inject helicity , but helicity can be continuously injected via the steady photospheric shear ( or twist ) motion .",
    "on the other hand , we consider reconnection - favored emerging flux models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to explain the characteristic variation pattern of @xmath32 shown in group b ( i.e. , the helicity sign reversal pattern ) .",
    "the numerical mhd simulation of @xcite showed that a cme can be initiated by the localized reconnection between a pre - existing coronal field and a reconnection - favored emerging flux . and",
    "it is evident that this reconnection - favored flux can provide helicity injection of the opposite sign into an existing helicity system : hence , the phase of the opposite - signed helicity injection can be produced by a steady and significant emergence of the reconnection - favored flux .",
    "in addition , as simulated by @xcite , a relatively strong shear motion of underlying field footpoints in the reverse direction compared to that of overlying field footpoints can explain the helicity sign reversal phase in group b. note also that there are some observational studies on spatial distributions of magnetic and electric current helicities in eruptive solar active regions , which may suggest a source region related to the helicity sign reversal .",
    "e.g. , from the study of fractional electric current helicity @xmath63 ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) in 9 cme - associated active regions , @xcite reported that a key emerging flux region or a moving magnetic feature near the main sunspot in the active regions brings up @xmath63 with a sign opposite to the dominant sign of the main sunspot with a duration of a few days .",
    "@xcite studied a filament eruption in the active region noaa 9682 and found that positive magnetic helicity was dominantly injected in the entire active region , while negative helicity was injected in local regions where the filament footpoints were located .",
    "in conclusion , we found that the two cme groups classified by the two characteristic helicity patterns have different pre - cme conditions and different cme characteristics .",
    "in addition , by comparing the observational helicity patterns with the expected patterns from some of numerical cme models , we presume that : the pre - cme condition of group a is associated with an emergence of a twisted flux rope or a steady shear ( or twist ) motion of magnetic field line footpoints , while the pre - cme condition of group b is involved with a reconnection - favored emerging flux or a reverse shear motion of magnetic field line footpoints .",
    "however , there are still some unanswered questions such as why there are significant differences between group a and group b in terms of cme kinematics ( e.g. , speed and acceleration ) and why there is a fairly good correlation between @xmath58 and @xmath50 for the source regions in group a , but a weak correlation for those in group b. this helicity study should therefore be carefully checked with aspects shown in several other cme numerical simulations to further understand the physics underlying cme triggering mechanism and dynamics . and",
    "a future study will focus on the spatial distribution of helicity flux density and the evolution of detailed magnetic field structures in the investigated active regions to better understand cme initiation .",
    "finally , we suggest that these characteristic variation patterns and helicity injection rate in cme - productive active regions can be used for the improvement of cme forecasting : ( 1 ) an early warning sign of cme occurrence could be given by the presence of a phase of monotonically increasing helicity as it is found that all the cmes under investigation occur after significant helicity injection ; ( 2 ) a warning sign for imminent cme occurrence could be also made when helicity injection rate becomes very slow or the opposite sign of helicity starts to be injected after the significant helicity injection in active regions ; and ( 3 ) the speed of future cme event can be estimated by the statistical study of the correlation between the cme speed and the average helicity injection rate in the active regions . for doing this , more observational studies are therefore being carried out to check whether the two characteristic helicity pattern are shown in other cme - productive active regions and to improve the correlation between the cme speed and the helcity injection rate .",

    "<S> in addition , these two cme groups show different characteristics as follows : ( 1 ) the average cme speed of group b ( 1330@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 ) is much faster than that of group a ( 870@xmath2km@xmath2s@xmath3 ) , ( 2 ) the cmes in group a tend to be single events , whereas those in group b mainly consist of successive events , and ( 3 ) flares related to the cmes in group b are relatively more energetic and impulsive than those in group a. our findings therefore suggest that the two cme groups have different pre - cme conditions in their source active regions and different cme characteristics . </S>"
