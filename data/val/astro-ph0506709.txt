    "galactic globular clusters are surprisingly rich in luminous x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "scenarios involving tidal capture by two stars @xcite and/or exchange reactions involving three stars @xcite are widely believed to be the sources of these strongly interacting binaries in clusters . the remarkable correlation between stellar encounter rate and number of x - ray sources in globular cluster cores",
    "@xcite supports this viewpoint .",
    "accreting white dwarf - main sequence star binaries  the cataclysmic variable ( cv ) stars  are almost certainly produced by the same mechanisms in clusters , and should also be plentiful in globulars @xcite . perhaps the best cluster to search for this predicted population is ngc 6397 . at a mere 3.3 kpc @xcite",
    "it is the closest globular cluster to the sun .",
    "thus even cvs resembling the least luminous known such objects ( with @xmath0 ) in this cluster should be detected with deep hst imagery .",
    "the initial discoveries of multiple x - ray sources @xcite and h@xmath1-bright stars @xcite in ngc 6397 were rapidly followed by spectrographic identification of essentially certain cvs with hydrogen and helium emission lines @xcite . remarkably ,",
    "all four cvs in this cluster with hst spectra show significant , and in three of four cases , prominent heii 4686 .",
    "this line is seen almost exclusively in magnetic cvs and nova - like variables @xcite , prompting @xcite and @xcite to suggest that magnetic cvs might well be the dominant cv population in globular clusters .    about half of all known field cvs @xcite are dwarf novae ( dn ) .",
    "most field dn have been discovered because they undergo 2 - 5 magnitude outbursts every few weeks to months @xcite .",
    "in contrast , strongly magnetic cvs are _ not _ observed to undergo dn outbursts .",
    "this is because dn eruptions are likely caused by a disk instability @xcite , and the accretion disks of magnetic cvs have been truncated or are absent .",
    "since large archival hst datasets of globular cluster images are available , we have been systematically looking for erupting dwarf novae in the cores of all such clusters @xcite . here",
    "we report the results of a search of ngc 6397 to determine if any of the magnetic cv candidates undergo eruptions .",
    "remarkably we do find dwarf nova eruptions of two of the putative ngc 6397 magnetic cvs .",
    "the hubble space telescope has imaged ngc 6397 during 5 separate epochs from 1996 to 2003 .",
    "our own 2003 datasets focused on stis uv imagery , heretofore unavailable and particularly useful in detecting cvs .",
    "the dates of observation , pi and number of hst program , filters used , number of frames and total exposure time in each filter are given in the observing log which is table 1 .",
    "we have carried out visual inspection and aperture photometry of each of the nine known cvs ( referred to by @xcite as cv1 through cv9 ) in every available archival hst image . while a modest level of variability ( up to a few tenths of a magnitude ) is detectable in all nine cvs , and two of the objects ( cv1 and cv6 )",
    "now have measured photometric periods @xcite , none is yet reported to show a dwarf nova - like outburst .",
    "the hst images of cv2 and cv3 are shown as photo - montages in figures 1 and 2 , respectively . the median brightness in every epoch , and in every available filter",
    "is shown with mean filter wavelength running from blue ( left ) to red ( right ) .",
    "we also show the 5-epoch light - curves of these two objects in figure 3 .",
    "each cv has been imaged in the wfpc2 f814w filter in epochs 1 , 2 and 3 , and in the stis ccdclear filter in epochs 4 and 5 .",
    "we have normalized epochs 1 - 3 with the first observation of each cv in epoch 1 , and epochs 4 - 5 with the first observation in epoch 4 .",
    "the key result of this paper is that the putative magnetic cataclysmic variables cv2 and cv3 are clearly detected as erupting dwarf novae .",
    "cv2 is seen to brighten ( in epoch 5 ) in the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) uv filter images .",
    "it is 2.7 magnitudes brighter than it was in epoch 4 .",
    "cv3 is seen in eruption in the second epoch in visible and near infrared pass - band images taken with the hst wide field and planetary camera ( wfpc2 ) .",
    "it is 1.8 magnitudes brighter in eruption than in quiescence .",
    "it is also seen in an intermediate brightness state ( between eruption and quiescence ) in blue and near - uv wfpc2 images in epoch 3 .",
    "the rise time of cv3 in epoch 2 ( about 2 days ) is well in accord with field dwarf nova rise times .",
    "the hst spectra of cv1 , cv2 and cv3 are presented in @xcite ; that of cv4 is given in @xcite .",
    "heii emission with equivalent widths in the range 6 - 15   appear in the spectra of all four objects , as do strong balmer lines .",
    "in particular , @xcite found for cv2 and cv3 , respectively , heii 4686 equivalent widths of 11 and 15  .",
    "the h@xmath2 equivalent widths of these same two objects are 32 and 59  , respectively .",
    "the disks in all four objects are faint ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xcite has carefully compared the disks and heii line ratios of cvs 1 - 4 with those of other cataclysmic systems .",
    "we refer the interested reader to that careful and exhaustive analysis , simply quoting here edmond et al.s conclusions regarding cvs 1 - 3 :    `` they do not appear to be recent novae or nova - likes because of their faint disks ( with extra evidence from their heii 4686   line ratios ) , nor do they appear to be dwarf novae because they have moderately strong heii lines .",
    "the final option is magnetic systems . to conclude , cvs 1 - 3 do not appear to be dwarf novae , but they could be dq her - type systems .",
    "a possible alternative to the dq her hypothesis is that some of the ngc 6397 cvs are old novae ( possibly in deep hibernation between outbursts ; see shara et al .",
    "1986 ) . ''",
    "figures 1 and 2 of this paper convincingly demonstrate that cv2 and cv3 are , in fact , erupting dwarf novae despite their prominent heii emission .",
    "intensive monitoring with hst is essential to determine if all of the cv candidates in ngc 6397and other globular clusters  eventually erupt as dwarf novae .",
    "the hibernation scenario of cvs @xcite postulates that old novae eventually display dwarf - nova like outbursts .",
    "one old classical nova in the globular cluster m80 has been recovered @xcite at dwarf nova - like luminosity , and one recent erupting classical nova in a globular cluster ( of the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ) has been reported @xcite .",
    "cv2 and cv3 could be hibernating old novae , but we have , at present , no observational proof that they once underwent nova eruptions .",
    "edmonds suggestion that the ngc 6397 cvs might be dq her - like magnetic systems ( also known as ips or intermediate polars ) might seem to be disproved with the observed dwarf nova eruptions of cv2 and cv3 . however , there are a few well - documented cases of ips that undergo dwarf nova eruptions , including gk per , ex hya , xy ari , do dra , tv col , ht cam and v1223 sgr .",
    "most dwarf novae show some heii emission ( see e.g. @xcite for a compilation ) , so cv2 and cv3 are certainly not unique in this respect .",
    "a comparison of the heii and h@xmath2 line strengths for the cvs in ngc 6397 and for field ips is presented by @xcite .",
    "both the line strengths and line ratios of heii and h@xmath2 for cv2 and cv3 are comparable to those of other low mass transfer rate ips , with ex hya being a particularly good match .",
    "@xcite have presented a model for dwarf nova - like outbursts in magnetic cvs , which they apply to tv col and gk per . if the white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable has a strong magnetic field , the inner region of the accretion disk is disrupted .",
    "they found that disruption of the inner disk region leads to shorter outbursts , and , for disk instabilities starting near the inner disk edge , to much longer intervals between outbursts .",
    "the outbursts of most ips tend to be rare , short and of only moderate amplitude . as an example",
    ", @xcite has noted that the ex hya outbursts occur at @xmath4 year intervals , last less than 4 days and are of only @xmath5 magnitude amplitude . if the many globular cluster cv candidates identified by chandra @xcite and hst @xcite are also intermediate polars then the remarkably small numbers of erupting dwarf novae found by hst in globular clusters @xcite can be explained . in particular , a population of even dozens of ips will only occasionally show a dwarf nova near maximum light . under this scenario",
    "we can predict that more of these cvs will eventually be seen to erupt if individual clusters are searched on dozens or hundreds of occasions .",
    "we have observed ngc 6397 with hst during 5 separate epochs .",
    "two of the four spectrographically confirmed cvs are observed to undergo dwarf nova eruptions with amplitudes of at least 1.8 and 2.7 magnitudes .",
    "these eruptions were somewhat unexpected , as both objects display moderately strong heii 4686 emission lines , generally associated with non - erupting , magnetic cvs .",
    "the dwarf nova - like eruptions reported in this paper can occur in intermediate polars , suggesting that some of the ngc 6397 cvs ( and by implication some of the cvs in other globular clusters ) are indeed magnetic systems .",
    "the apparent rarity of erupting dwarf novae in globular clusters with large cv candidate populations is reconciled if those cvs are infrequently erupting intermediate polars .",
