    "since the discovery of the quantized electronic conductance phenomena @xcite , the double - bend electron waveguide has been investigated as a very important case .",
    "the problem was firstly studied by weisshaar et al .",
    "@xcite using mode - matching technique .",
    "the experiment work on the low temperature conductance of the double - bend waveguide was carried out by wu et al .",
    "@xcite by using the recursive greens function technique , kawamura et al .",
    "@xcite studied this double - bend waveguide again .",
    "all the works showed strong resonant transmission due to internal reflections in the special structure and refs .",
    "@xcite showed the `` existence of an energy gap between the first and second subband threshold energies where the conductance is suppressed for multiple double - bend structures '' .",
    "based on the property of the strong resonant transmission through the double - bend waveguide , shi et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a simple spin filter with which an extremely large spin current is expected .",
    "same as the electronic conductance , the thermal conductivity is also important for semiconductor nanostructures . for an ideal elastic beam at an enough low temperature ,",
    "the thermal conductivity is dominated by the ballistic phonon and is quantized in a universal unit , @xmath0 , analogous to the well - known @xmath1 electronic conductance quantum .",
    "@xcite these predictions have been verified experimentally @xcite . since then , many works have been done to study the geometrical effects on the transmission of the acoustic phonon and the thermal conductivity through the quantum waveguide with various geometries @xcite . but",
    "as an important case , the quantum waveguide with a double - bend structure has not been studied on the phonon transmission coefficients and thermal conductivity .",
    "therefore , in this work , we calculate the phonon transmission coefficients and thermal conductivity in a double - bend quantum waveguide using the scattering - matrix method @xcite and considering the stress - free boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] , we present the model and the numerical method briefly .",
    "the numerical results for a one double - bend structure are discussed in section  [ sec3 ] . in section  [ sec4 ] ,",
    "the results of a two double - bend structures are presented .",
    "finally , a summary is made in section  [ sec5 ] .",
    "( a ) double - bend waveguide with lead width @xmath2 , lateral length @xmath3 , and longitudinal length @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) two double - bend waveguides in a series with the longitudinal length @xmath5.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the geometry of the double - bend quantum waveguide is sketched in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "regions - i and -iii are the leads of the device ; region - ii is the midsection .",
    "the parameters of this device are @xmath6 and @xmath4 , which are the lateral width of the leads , the lateral width of the midsection and the longitudinal length of the midsection , respectively .",
    "we assume that the temperature in the two leads ( regions - i and -iii ) are @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; and the temperature difference @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) between two leads is very small .",
    "the mean temperature @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) may then be adopted as the temperature of two leads . in this work",
    ", we choose the same thickness for the three regions and let the thickness smaller than the other two dimensions and also than the wavelength or the coherence length of the elastic waves ; there is no mixing of the @xmath13 modes and a two - dimensional calculation is then adequate @xcite . for the imperfect contact at the regions - i and -iii , the thermal conductance @xmath14 at temperature @xmath11",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transmission coefficient from mode @xmath17 of region - i at frequency @xmath18 across all the interfaces into the modes of region - iii ; @xmath19 is the cutoff frequency of the @xmath17th mode ; @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath11 is the temperature ; and @xmath22 is the plank s constant",
    ". it can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eqn1 ] ) that the central issue of the problem is to obtain the transmission coefficient , @xmath16 .",
    "we consider the scalar model for the elastic wave ; the model for thin geometry at low temperature is used so that the calculation is two - dimensional . here",
    ", we treat the simplest case for a horizontally polarized wave ( sh ) ( polarized along the @xmath13 direction ) propagating in the @xmath23-direction .",
    "so the wave equation of the displacement field @xmath24 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is related to the mass density @xmath27 and elastic stiffness constant @xmath28 by @xmath29 the stress - free boundary conditions at the edges require @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the unit vector normal to the edge . for the double - bend structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the solution to eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) in region-@xmath32 ( regions i , ii and iii ) can be expressed as @xmath33\\phi_m^{\\xi}\\left(y\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the reference coordinate along the @xmath23-direction in region-@xmath32 ; @xmath35 is the wavenumber of the transmitted and reflected waves in region-@xmath32 , giving by the energy conservation condition @xmath36 with @xmath37 the transverse dimension of region-@xmath32 ; @xmath38 represents the transverse wavefunction of acoustic mode-@xmath17 in region-@xmath32 , @xmath39 in principle , the sum over @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) includes all propagating modes and evanescent modes ( imaginary @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , in the practical calculation , besides all the propagating modes we only take a same limited number of evanescent modes into account to meet the desired precision for each region in a double - bend structure .",
    "the boundary matching conditions require the continuity of the displacement @xmath24 and the stress @xmath41 at the interface of regions - i and -ii and the interface of regions - ii and -iii .",
    "so we can obtain the equations for the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ eqn4 ] ) . rewriting the resulted equations in the form of matrix",
    ", we can derive the transmission coefficient , @xmath42 , by the scattering matrix method @xcite .    in the calculations , we employ the following values of elastic stiffness constant and the mass density @xcite : @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and choosing @xmath45  nm .",
    "for acoustic phonon mode , the stress - free boundary condition allows acoustic waves propagate through the structure in the zero - th mode with cutoff frequency @xmath46 .",
    "first , we discuss the lowest sh acoustic mode propagate through the double - bend structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) from region - i to region - iii .",
    "the transmission coefficients of the zero - th mode versus the lateral length @xmath3 and the incident phonon frequency @xmath47 for the double - bend structure with @xmath45  nm are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2a ] ( @xmath48  nm ) and [ fig2b ] ( @xmath49  nm ) .",
    "one can find from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the transmission coefficient approaches unity as @xmath50 and is independent of the lateral length @xmath3 .",
    "this is because , at @xmath51 , the wavelength of the phonon is much larger than the dimension of the lateral length @xmath3 of region - ii and the displacement field @xmath24 then becomes essentially the same throughout .",
    "we can also find from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that , for @xmath52  nm , the transmission coefficient is unity for any incident frequency . in this case",
    "the double - bend waveguide reverts to be a uniform waveguide ; and in the uniform waveguide , the transmission coefficient of the zero - th mode of phonon is unity .",

    "one can find more resonance like features occur in the transmission coefficient with increasing incident frequency or the lateral length of region - ii , @xmath3 ; and the influence of the longitudinal width @xmath4 also appear .    to clearly see the resonance structure in the transmission coefficient , the transmission coefficient as a function of @xmath47 for different lateral lengths of region - ii , @xmath3 , and as a function of @xmath3 for different @xmath47",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in region - ii , the propagation wave and reflected wave with the same wavenumber , @xmath53 , will couple together .",
    "the reflected wave from region - ii will interfere with the propagation wave in region - i .",
    "when the phase shift between the incident wave in the region - i and the reflected wave from the region - ii reaches @xmath54 , the transmission will be enforced , and , @xmath55 . for a fixed lateral length @xmath3 , same as the resonant transmission of electrons @xcite , the resonance condition is approximately @xmath56 . in figs .",
    "[ fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] , the arrows mark the resonance positions . in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] , when @xmath57 , the resonance peak positions are similar as the positions in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] .",
    "this is easy to understand : in this case only the zero - th mode can exist in region - ii , so the wavenumber @xmath58 is irrelevant with @xmath4 . but for @xmath59 , because of more than one transverse mode existing in the region - ii the transmission coefficients in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] are totally different with those in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] .",
    "furthermore , from figs .",
    "[ fig3a ] and [ fig3b ] , one can find that the closer the frequency to the cutoff frequency of the @xmath60th mode in region - ii , the narrower the resonance peak is .",
    "this is due to the fact that at the cutoff frequency of the @xmath60th mode , the @xmath60th mode is excited and the resonant condition is destroyed totally .",
    "the transmission coefficients as a function of the lateral length @xmath3 show periodic resonance in figs .",
    "[ fig3c ] and [ fig3d ] .",

    "( [ eqn1 ] ) can truncated at @xmath74 for @xmath69 .",
    "thermal conductivity reduced by @xmath75 , as a function of the reduced temperature , @xmath76 , for the different lateral lengths of @xmath3 : ( a ) the total thermal conductivity ; ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) are the thermal conductivity of the modes-0 , 1 and 2 , respectively . ]",

    "[ fig4 ] shows the reduced thermal conductivity @xmath80 as a function of the reduced temperature @xmath81 .",
    "one can find from fig .",
    "4(a ) that the total reduced thermal conductivity approaches to the unity ( i.e. the thermal conductivity , @xmath82 , approaches to the ideal universal value , @xmath83 ) when @xmath84 ; the result is independent of the lateral length of the double - bend waveguide .",
    "this is because the wavelength of the incident phonons is much larger than the dimension of the region - ii when @xmath85 and , thus , the scattering of phonons in the region - ii is negligible .",
    "4(a ) shows a thermal conductivity plateau at @xmath86 and at low temperatures due to no scattering ; and the thermal conductivity increases lineally with the temperature because the higher transverse modes are excited at higher temperatures ( as shown in figs .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) ) . from fig .",
    "4(a ) , for @xmath87 , one can find the thermal conductivity decreases from the universal value to a minimum at low temperatures , then increases with the the temperature .",
    "this can be explained from figs .",
    "4(b)-4(d ) : with increasing temperature , the thermal conductivity of the mode-0 decreases for @xmath88 , so the total thermal conductivity decreases from the universal value .",
    "when the temperature further increases , the higher mode can be excited and the total thermal will increase after reach the minimum . furthermore , fig .",
    "4(a ) shows that the total thermal conductivity decreases with increasing the lateral length ; and when @xmath89  nm , the total thermal conductivity is insensitive to further increasing of @xmath3 .    from fig .",
    "5(a ) , one can find that the transmission coefficient of the zero - th mode , @xmath77 , for @xmath90  nm is higher than that for @xmath91 and @xmath92  nm ; and @xmath77 for @xmath91  nm is similar as for @xmath93  nm . so for the thermal conductivity of mode-0 shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) , it is higher for @xmath90  nm than for @xmath91 and @xmath92  nm .",
    "5(b ) shows the transmission coefficients of the @xmath60th mode for different lateral lengths of @xmath3 . here , @xmath78 for @xmath93  nm is higher than that for @xmath91  nm , so the thermal conductivity for @xmath91  nm is lower than that for @xmath93  nm in fig .",
    "the thermal conductivity for @xmath91  nm is higher than that for @xmath90  nm shown in fig .",
    "4(d ) , because the transmission coefficient of @xmath94th mode for @xmath91  nm is higher than that for @xmath90  nm in fig .",
    "fig .  [ fig6 ] shows the transmission coefficient through a quantum waveguide with more than one double - bend structures .",
    "[ fig6a ] represents the case of a two double - bend waveguide for different longitudinal lengths of @xmath5 .",
    "one can find from the figure that an additional double - bend structure makes the frequency gap appear ; and the gap width decreases with @xmath5 increases .",
    "furthermore , it is obviously that the width of resonance peak at the frequency just above the gap region decreases with @xmath5 increases . fig .",
    "[ fig6b ] compares the transmission coefficients through a two double - bend structures and a three double - bend structures for the same value of @xmath5 .",
    "adding an additional double - bend structure to the two double - bend structures does nt change the frequency gap width but makes an additional resonance peak appearing at the frequency above the gap region .",
    "it may draw conclusions that the first additional double - bend structure to the single double - bend structure suppresses the transmission coefficient and forms a frequency gap ; and an additional resonance peak is formed at the frequency just above the gap region for each additional double - bend structures .",
    "we can easily expect that an additional double - bend structure increases the scattering of the phonons so that the thermal conductivity decreases .",
    "using the scattering matrix method , we have investigated the phonon transmission and thermal conductivity in a double - bend waveguide structure .",
    "it is observed strong resonant transmission determined by the scattering in region - ii .",
    "the position and the width of the resonance peaks are determined by the longitudinal length @xmath4 of region - ii . the thermal conductivity approaches to universe value for @xmath84 .",
    "this is because the wavelength of the incident phonons is much larger than the dimension of the region - ii when @xmath95 ; the scattering of phonons by the region - ii is negligible .",
    "due to the scattering in region - ii , the thermal conductivity of mode-0 decreases with increasing temperature ; and at high temperatures , more than one mode are exited and the thermal conductivity of these exited modes increases .",
    "the total thermal conductivity decreases thus to a minimum , then increases with the temperature .",
    "the transmission coefficient of a double - bend structure determines the thermal conductivity for different lateral lengths of @xmath3 .    in this paper , the transmission coefficients and the thermal conductivity in multiple double - bend waveguide structures are also studied .",
    "the results show that the first additional double - bend structure to the single double - bend structure suppresses the transmission coefficient and forms a frequency gap ; and an additional resonance peak appears at the frequency just above the gap region for each additional double - bend structure .",
    "the additional double - bend structure suppresses more the thermal conductivity .",
