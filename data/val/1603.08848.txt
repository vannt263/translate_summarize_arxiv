    "the masses and widths of the low - lying charm mesons are now rather well determined experimentally , in the odd- and even - parity , strange and nonstrange sectors ( for summaries , see refs .",
    "the patterns of the masses and interactions of these mesons are governed by two approximate symmetries : the spin symmetry of the heavy quark and the @xmath3 chiral symmetry of the light quarks .",
    "both symmetries can be incorporated in a single framework using heavy - hadron chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0 ) , an effective field theory for the interactions of a meson containing a single heavy quark @xcite .    within this theory ,",
    "the masses of the low - lying odd- and even - parity @xmath1 mesons have been studied , including one - loop chiral corrections @xcite .",
    "the chiral lagrangian at this , third , order contains a number of unknown low - energy constants ( lecs ) .",
    "these can not be determined uniquely from experimental data on the meson spectrum because their number exceeds the number of low - lying mesons .",

    "@xcite fitted expressions that depend nonlinearly on these constants and found multiple solutions , often with quite different numerical values for them . as a result",
    ", no clear pattern emerged from these fits .    in this paper , we use a different approach to fit these parameters to remove these ambiguities and provide a clearer picture . the key difference from previous work",
    "@xcite is that we use the physical values of the charm meson masses in evaluating the chiral loops .",
    "one important consequence of this is to put thresholds at the correct energies relative to the masses of unstable particles and hence to ensure that the imaginary parts of the loops are correctly related to the observed decay widths of the heavy mesons .",
    "a second consequence is that the parameters  the lecs  appear only in the tree - level contributions to the masses .",
    "this allows us to determine uniquely eight linear combinations of the lecs from the experimental masses .",
    "these eight parameters can not be further disentangled into the individual lecs using the experimental spectrum alone . by using the experimental masses in the loops ,",
    "we generate terms that are of order higher than third order in the chiral expansion . these include divergences that we can not cancel using counterterms in our lagrangian .",
    "we use the @xmath4-functions associated with these uncontrolled higher - order contributions to provide an estimate of the theoretical errors introduced by our approach .",
    "another , more technical , difference from previous work on @xmath0 is that we have used corrected expressions for the chiral loop functions , in contrast to the expressions presented in @xcite which use an inconsistent renormalization scheme .",
    "the results from the charm meson sector are used to predict the masses of the full set of the low - lying @xmath2-meson states .",
    "the predicted masses from our theory of the ground states are in good agreement with the well - determined masses .",
    "the first set of excited @xmath2 meson states has not yet been observed ; thus our results can be used to provide useful information for experimentalists investigating such states .",
    "the near degeneracy of scalar @xmath2 meson states the mass of the nonstrange scalar @xmath2-meson is similar to that of strange one is confirmed in our predictions using @xmath0 .",
    "our results are at variance with those in ref .",
    "we will show why the previous studies of the near mass degeneracy in the scalar @xmath1- and @xmath2-meson sectors using the approach of @xmath0 led to unsatisfactory results .",

    "ii , the heavy - hadron chiral lagrangian we use is briefly reviewed . in sec .",
    "iii , we present the resulting expression for the meson masses .",
    "since the number of the lecs exceeds the number of obervables , the lecs are grouped into eight linear combinations that are equivalent to the number of observables . in sec .",
    "iv , we use the @xmath1-meson spectrum to fit these parameters .",
    "the results from the charm meson spectrum are then used in sec .",

    "<S> we study the masses of the low - lying charm and bottom mesons within the framework of heavy hadron chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we work to third order in the chiral expansion , where meson loops contribute . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous approaches , we use physical meson masses in evaluating these loops . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that their imaginary parts are consistent with the observed widths of the @xmath1-mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest odd- and even - parity , strange and nonstrange charm mesons provide enough constraints to determine only certain linear combinations of the low - energy constants in the effective lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on how lattice qcd could provide further information to disentangle these constants . </S>",
    "<S> then we use the results from the charm sector to predict the spectrum of odd- and even - parity of the bottom mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted masses from our theory are in good agreement with experimentally measured masses for the case of the odd - parity sector . for the even - parity sector , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-meson states have not yet been observed ; thus , our results provide useful information for experimentalists investigating such states . </S>",
    "<S> the near degeneracy of nonstrange and strange scalar @xmath2 mesons is confirmed in our predictions using @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we show why previous approaches of using @xmath0 in studying the mass degeneracy in the scalar states of charm and bottom meson sectors gave unsatisfactory results . </S>"
