    "to improve the precision of retrieval output , especially within the very few ( e.g , 5 or 10 ) highest - ranked documents that are returned , a number of researchers @xcite have considered a _",
    "structural ing _ strategy .",
    "the idea is to re - rankthe top @xmath0 documents that some initial search engine produces , where the re - ordering utilizes information about inter - document relationships within that set .",
    "promising results have been previously obtained by using document _ centrality _ within the initially retrieved list to perform structural ing , on the premise that if the quality of this list is reasonable to begin with , then the documents that are most related to most of the documents on the list are likely to be the most relevant ones .",
    "in particular , in our prior work @xcite we adapted _ pagerank _",
    "@xcite  which , due to the success of google , is surely the most well - established algorithm for defining and computing centralitywithin a directed graph  to the task of re - rankingnon - hyperlinked document sets .",
    "the arguably most well - known alternative to pagerank is kleinberg s _ hits _ algorithm @xcite . the major conceptual way",
    "in which hitsdiffers from pagerank is that it defines two different types of centralitems : each node is assigned both a _ hub _ and an _ authority _ score as opposed to a single pagerank score . in the web setting , in which hitswas originally proposed , good hubs correspond roughly to high - quality resource lists or collections of pointers , whereas good authorities correspond to the high - quality resources themselves ; thus , distinguishing between two differing but interdependent types of webpages is quite appropriate .",
    "our previous study @xcite applied hits to non - web documents .",
    "we found that its performance was comparable to or better than that of algorithms that do not involve structural ing ; however , hits was not as effective as pagerank @xcite .    do these results imply that pagerank is better than hitsfor structural ingof non - web documents ?",
    "not necessarily , because there may exist graph - construction methods that are more suitable for hits . note that the only entities considered in our previous study were documents .",
    "if we could introduce entities distinct from documents but enjoying a mutually reinforcing relationship with them , then we might better satisfy the spirit of the hubs - versus - authorities distinction , and thus derive stronger results utilizing hits .",
    "a crucial insight of the present paper is that document _",
    "clusters _ appear extremely well - suited to play this complementary role .",
    "the intuition is that : ( a ) given those clusters that are `` most representative '' of the user s information need ,",
    "the documents within those clusters are likely to be relevant ; and ( b ) the `` most representative '' clusters should be those that contain many relevant documents . this apparently circular reasoning is strongly reminiscent of the inter - related hubs and authorities concepts underlying hits .",
    "also , clusters have long been considered a promising source of information .",
    "the well - known _ cluster hypothesis _ @xcite encapsulates the intuition that clusters can reveal groups of relevant documents ; in practice , the potential utility of clustering for this purpose has been demonstrated for both the case wherein clusters were created in a query - independent fashion @xcite and the re - rankingsetting @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we show through an array of experiments that consideration of the mutual reinforcement of clusters and documents in determining centralitycan lead to highly effective algorithms for re - rankingan initially retrieved list .",
    "specifically , our experimental results show that the centrality - induction methods that we previously studied solely in the context of document - only graphs @xcite result in much better re - rankingperformance if implemented over bipartite graphs of documents ( on one side ) and clusters ( on the other side ) .",
    "for example , ranking _ documents _ by their `` authoritativeness '' as computed by hits upon these cluster - document graphs yields better performance than that of a previously proposed pagerank implementation applied to document - only graphs .",
    "interestingly , we also find that _ cluster _",
    "authority scores can be used to identify clusters containing a large percentage of relevant documents .",
    "since we are focused on the structural ingparadigm , our algorithms are applied not to the entire corpus , but to a subset @xmath1 ( henceforth @xmath2 ) , defined as the top @xmath0 documents retrieved in response to the query @xmath3 by a given initial retrieval engine .",
    "some of our algorithms also take into account a set @xmath4 of _ clusters _ of the documents in @xmath2 .",
    "we use @xmath5 to refer generically to whichever set of entities  either @xmath2 or @xmath6  is used by a given algorithm .    the basic idea behind the algorithms we consider is to determine centralitywithin a _ relevance - flow graph _ ,",
    "defined as a directed graph with non - negative weights on the edges in which    * the nodes are the elements of @xmath5 , and * the weight on an edge between node @xmath7 and @xmath8 is based on the strength of evidence for @xmath8 s relevance that would follow from an assertion that @xmath7 is relevant .    by construction , then , any measure of the centralityof @xmath9 should measure the accumulation of evidence for its relevance according to the set of interconnections among the entities in @xmath5 .",
    "such information can then optionally be subjected to additional processing , such as integration with information on each item s similarity to the query , to produce a final re - rankingof @xmath2 .",
    "[ [ conventions - regarding - graphs ] ] conventions regarding graphs + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the types of relevance - flow graphswe consider can all be represented as weighted directed graphs of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a finite non - empty set of nodes and @xmath12 is a non - negative edge - weight function . note that thus our graphs technically have edges between all ordered pairs of nodes ( self - loops included ) ; however , edges with zero edge - weight are conceptually equivalent to missing edges . for clarity ,",
    "we write @xmath13 instead of @xmath14 .",
    "the hitsalgorithm for computing centralitycan be motivated as follows .",
    "let @xmath15 be the input graph , and let @xmath8 be a node in @xmath11 .",
    "first , suppose we somehow knew the _ hub score _",
    "@xmath16 of each node @xmath17 , where `` hubness '' is the extent to which the nodes that @xmath7 points to are `` good '' in some sense .",
    "then , @xmath8 s _ authority score _",
    "@xmath18 would be a natural measure of how `` good '' @xmath8 is , since a node that is `` strongly '' pointed to by high - quality hubs ( which , by definition , tend to point to `` good '' nodes ) receives a high score .",
    "but where do we get the hub score for a given node @xmath7 ?",
    "a natural choice is to use the extent to which @xmath7 `` strongly '' points to highly authoritative nodes : @xmath19 clearly , equations [ eq : auth ] and [ eq : hub ] are mutually recursive .",
    "however , the iterative hits algorithm provably converges to ( non - identically - zero , non - negative ) score functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 that satisfy the above pair of equations .",
    "figure [ fig : hits - icon ] depicts the `` iconic '' case in which the input graph @xmath22 is _ one - way bipartite _ ,",
    "that is , @xmath11 can be partitioned into non - empty sets @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that only edges in @xmath25 can receive positive weight , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "it is the case that @xmath28 for every @xmath29 and @xmath30 for every @xmath31 ; in this sense , the left - hand nodes are `` pure '' hubs and the right - hand nodes are `` pure '' authorities .    note that in the end , we need to produce a _ single _",
    "centralityscore for each node @xmath32 . for experimental simplicity",
    ", we consider only two possibilities in this paper  using @xmath33 as the final centralityscore , or using @xmath34 instead  although combining the hub and authority scores is also an interesting possibility .",
    "recall that the fundamental operation in our structural ingparadigm is to compute the centralityof entities ( with)in a set @xmath5 .",
    "one possibility is to define @xmath5 as @xmath2 , the documents in the initially retrieved set ; we refer generically to any relevance - flow graphinduced under this choice as a * _ document - to - document _ * graph . but",
    "note that for non - web documents , it may not be obvious _ a priori _ what kinds of documents are hubs and what kinds are authorities .    alternatively , we can define @xmath5 as @xmath6 , where @xmath4 consists of clusters of the documents in @xmath2 . on a purely formal level",
    ", doing so allows us to map the hubs / authorities duality discussed above onto the documents / clusters duality , as follows .",
    "recalling our discussion of the `` iconic '' case of one - way bipartitegraphs @xmath35 , we can create * _ document - as - authority _ * graphs simply by choosing @xmath36 and @xmath37 , so that necessarily clusters serve the role of ( pure ) hubs and documents serve the role of ( pure ) authorities .",
    "contrariwise , we can create * _ document - as - hub _ * graphs by setting @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "but the advantages of incorporating cluster - based information are not just formal .",
    "the well - known _ cluster hypothesis _",
    "@xcite encapsulates the intuition that clusters can reveal groups of relevant documents ; in practice , the potential utility of clustering for this purpose has been demonstrated a number of times , whether the clusters were created in a query - independent fashion @xcite , or from the initially most - highly - ranked documents for some query @xcite ( i.e. , in the re - rankingsetting ) . since centralclusters are , supposedly , those that accrue the most evidence for relevance , documents that are strongly identified with such clusters should themselves be judged highly relevant . but identifying such clusters is facilitated by knowledge of which documents are most likely to be relevant  exactly the mutual reinforcement property that hitswas designed to leverage .",
    "we will compare the results of using the hitsalgorithm against those derived using pagerank instead .",
    "this is a natural comparison because pagerank is the most well - known centrality - induction algorithm utilized for ranking documents , and because in earlier work @xcite , pagerank performed quite well as a tool for structural ingof non - web documents , at least when applied to document - to - documentgraphs .",
    "one can think of pagerank as a version of hitsin which the hub / authority distinction has been collapsed .",
    "thus , writing `` pr '' for both @xmath40 and @xmath41 , we _ conceptually _ have the ( single ) equation @xmath42 however , in practice , we incorporate brin and page s smoothing scheme @xcite together with a correction for nodes with no positive - weight edges emanating from them @xcite : @xmath43\\cdot { { \\sf pr}\\xspace}({u } ) \\nonumber \\\\   & + &   \\sum_{{u}\\in { v } : { out({u } ) } = 0 } \\frac{1}{|{v}|}\\cdot { { \\sf pr}\\xspace}({u } ) \\label{eq : pagerank}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is the damping factor . , not 1 .",
    "conceptually , the role of the second summation in equation [ eq : pagerank ] is to set @xmath46 for these no - outflow nodes . ]",
    "equation [ eq : pagerank ] is recursive , but there are iterative algorithms that provably converge to the unique positive solution @xmath47 satisfying the sum - normalization constraint @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "moreover , a ( non - trivial ) _ closed - form _  and quite easily computed  solution exists for one - way bipartitegraphs :    if @xmath49 is one - way bipartite , then @xmath50 is an affine transformation ( with respect to positive constants ) of , and therefore equivalent for ranking purposes to , the unique positive sum - normalized solution to equation [ eq : pagerank ] .",
    "[ thm : pagerankbip ]    ( proof omitted due to space constraints . )",
    "interestingly , this result shows that while one might have thought that clusters and documents would `` compete '' for pagerank score when placed within the same graph , in our document - as - authorityand document - as - hubgraphs this is not the case .",
    "earlier work @xcite also considered scoring a node @xmath8 by its _ influx _ , @xmath51 .",
    "this can be viewed as either a non - recursive version of equation [ eq : pagerank - concept ] , or as an un - normalized analog of equation [ eq : bip - pagerank ] .",
    "clearly , we can rank documents by their scores as computed by any of the functions introduced above .",
    "but when we operate on document - as - authorityor document - as - hubgraphs , centralityscores for the clusters are also produced .",
    "these can be used to derive alternative means for ranking documents .",
    "we follow liu and croft s approach @xcite : first , rank the documents within ( or most strongly associated to ) each cluster according to the initial retrieval engine s scores ; then , derive the final list by concatenating the within - cluster lists in order of decreasing cluster score , discarding repeats .",
    "such an approach would be successful if cluster centralityis strongly correlated with the property of containing a large percentage of relevant documents .",
    "[ [ ranking - algorithms ] ] ranking algorithms + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    since we have two possible ranking paradigms , we adopt the following * algorithm naming conventions*. names consist of a hyphen - separated prefix and suffix .",
    "the prefix ( `` doc '' or `` clust '' ) indicates whether documents were ranked directly by their centralityscores , or indirectly through the concatenation process outlined above in which it is the _",
    "clusters _ centralityscores that were employed .",
    "the suffix ( `` auth '' , `` hub '' , `` pr '' , or `` influx '' ) indicates which score function ( @xmath21 , @xmath20 , @xmath47 ( or @xmath52 ) , or influx ) was used to measure centrality . for a given re - rankingalgorithm",
    ", we indicate the graph upon which it was run in brackets , e.g. , `` doc - auth[@xmath53 '' .",
    "the potential merits of _ query - dependent clustering _ , that is , clustering the documents retrieved in response to a query , have long been recognized @xcite , especially in interactive retrieval settings @xcite .",
    "however , automatically detecting clusters that contain many relevant documents remains a very hard task @xcite .",
    "section [ sec : clustauth ] presents results for detecting such clusters using centrality - based cluster ranking .",
    "recently , there has been a growing body of work on graph - based modeling for different language - processing tasks wherein links are induced by inter - entity textual similarities .",
    "examples include document @xcite , text summarization @xcite , sentence retrieval @xcite , and document representation @xcite .",
    "in contrast to our methods , links connect entities of the same type , and clusters of entities are not modeled within the graphs .    while ideas similar to ours by virtue of leveraging the mutual reinforcement of entities of different types , or using bipartite graphs of such entities for clustering ( rather than using clusters ) , are abundant ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we focus here on exploiting mutual reinforcement in ad hoc retrieval .",
    "random walks ( with early stopping ) over bipartite graphs of terms and documents were used for query expansion @xcite , but in contrast to our work , no stationary solution was sought . a similar `` short chain '' approach utilizing bipartite graphs of clusters and documents for ranking an entire corpus",
    "was recently proposed @xcite , thereby constituting the work most resembling ours .",
    "however , again , a stationary distribution was not sought .",
    "also , _ query drift _ prevention mechanisms were required to obtain good performance ; in our re - rankingsetting , we need not employ such mechanisms .",
    "most aspects of the evaluation framework described below are adopted from our previous experiments with non - cluster - based structural ing@xcite so as to facilitate direct comparison .",
    "section 4.1 of @xcite provides a more detailed justification of the experimental design . the main conceptual changes . for citation purposes ,",
    "the numbers reported in the current paper should be used . ] here are : a slightly larger parameter search - space for the `` out - degree '' parameter @xmath54 ( called the `` ancestry '' parameter @xmath55 in @xcite ) ; and , of course , the incorporation of clusters .

    "the chart below shows the effect of ranking entities by hub scores instead . specifically , the `` documents ? ''",
    "column compares ( i.e. , ranking documents by authoritativeness ) to ( i.e. , ranking documents by hubness ) ; similarly , the `` clusters ? ''",
    "column compares to .",
    "each entry depicts , in descending order of performance ( except for the one indicated tie ) as one moves left to right , those centralityscoring functions that lead to an improvement over the initial ranking : @xmath56 stands for `` authority '' and @xmath57 for `` hub '' .",
    "cases in which the improvement is significant are marked with a ` * ' .",

    "but authority - based re - rankingappears to be an even better choice overall .",

    "but an alternative interpretation @xcite is that non - smoothed ( or no - random - jump ) pagerank , as expressed by equation ( [ eq : pagerank - concept ] ) , is applied to a _",
    "different _ version of wherein the original edge weights @xmath13 have been smoothed as follows : @xmath58}}{({{u}{\\to}{v } } ) } } { \\stackrel{def}{=}}\\frac{1 - { \\lambda}}{|{v}| } + { \\lambda}\\frac{{{{\\mathit wt}}{({{u}{\\to}{v}})}}}{{out({u } ) } } \\label{eq : reweight}\\ ] ] ( we ignore nodes with no positive - weight out - edges to simplify discussion , and omit the superscripts for clarity )",
    ".    how does hitsperform on document - to - document graphs that are `` truly equivalent '' , in the sense of employing the above edge - weighting regime , to those that pagerankis applied to ?",
    "one reason this is an interesting question is that hitsassigns scores of zero to nodes that are not in the graph s largest connected component ( with respect to positive - weight edges , considered to be bi - directional ) .",
    "notice that the original graph may have several connected components , whereas utilizing @xmath59}}$ ] ensures that each node has a positive - weight directed edge to every other node . additionally , the re - weighted version of hitshas provable stability properties @xcite .",
    "we found that in nearly all of our evaluation settings for document - to - document graphs ( three corpora @xmath60 three evaluation metrics ) , doc - auth[]achieved better results using @xmath59}}$ ] edge weights .",
    "however , we can not discount the possibility that the performance differences might be due simply to the inclusion of the extra interpolation - parameter @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , in all but one case , the improved results were still below those for doc - pagerank[](and always lagged behind those of doc - auth [ ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the situation is qualitatively different if we consider graphs instead . in brief , we applied a smoothing scheme analogous to that described above , but only to edges leading from a left - hand node ( cluster ) to a right - hand node ( document ) '' in equation ( [ eq : reweight ] ) must be changed to the number of right - hand nodes . ] ; we thus preserved the one - way bipartitestructure . only in two of the nine evaluation settings did this change cause an increase in performance of doc - auth[]over the results attained under the original edge - weighting scheme , despite the fact that the re - weighting involves an extra free parameter .",
    "thus , while we have already demonstrated in previous sections of this paper that information about document - cluster similarity relationships is very valuable , the results just mentioned suggest that such information is more useful in `` raw '' form .",
    "[ [ re - anchoring - to - the - query ] ] re - anchoring to the query + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in previous work , we showed that pagerankcentralityscores induced over document - based graphs can be used as a multiplicative weight on document query - likelihood terms , the intent being to cope with cases in which centralityin @xmath2 and relevance are not strongly correlated @xcite . indeed , employing this technique on the ap , trec8 , and wsj corpora , prec@5 increases from @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , to @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the same modification could be applied to the -based algorithms , although it is not particularly well - motivated in the hitscase . while pagerankscores correspond to a stationary distribution that could be loosely interpreted as a prior @xcite , in which case multiplicative combination with query likelihood is sensible , it is not usual to assign a probabilistic interpretation to hub or authority scores .",
    "nonetheless , for the sake of comparison completeness , we applied this idea to the doc - auth[]algorithm , yielding the following performance changes : from @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 to @xmath71 , @xmath67 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "these results are still as good as  and for two corpora better than  those for pagerankas a multiplicative weight on query likelihood .",
    "thus , it may be the case that centralityscores induced over a document - based graph are more effective as a multiplicative bias on query - likelihood than as direct representations of relevance in @xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) ; but , modulo the caveat above , it seems that when centralityis induced over cluster - based one - way bipartitegraphs , the correlation with relevance is much stronger , and hence this kind of centralityserves as a better `` bias '' on query - likelihood .",
    "we have shown that leveraging the mutually reinforcing relationship between clusters and documents to determine centralityis very beneficial not only for directly finding relevant documents in an initially retrieved list , but also for finding clusters of documents from this list that contain a high number of relevant documents .",
    "specifically , we demonstrated the superiority of cluster - document bipartite graphs to document - only graphs as the input to centrality - induction algorithms .",
    "our method for finding `` authoritative '' documents ( or clusters ) using hits over these bipartite graphs results in state - of - the - art performance for document ( and cluster ) re - ranking .    * acknowledgments *   we thank eric breck , claire cardie , oren etzioni , jon kleinberg , art munson , filip radlinski , ves stoyanov , justin wick and the anonymous reviewers for valuable comments .",
