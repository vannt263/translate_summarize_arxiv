    "the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena in multicomponent fluid systems is very interesting from the theoretical as well as practical point of view . whereas in one - component fluid systems",
    "only gas - liquid equilibria exist , three different types of two - phase equilibria have to be considered in fluid mixtures : gas - liquid , liquid - liquid and gas - gas equilibria . despite the numerous experimental results now available @xcite- @xcite , theoretical achievements in understanding a microscopic mechanism of phase behaviour and nonuniversal critical properties of multicomponent fluids are limited .",
    "most of the theoretical studies devoted to this problem may be divided into three main groups : phenomenological theories , mean field approaches and integral equation methods .",
    "the phenomenological approaches @xcite- @xcite give predictions about critical exponents and scaling functions but no quantitative estimates of nonuniversal critical amplitudes are possible within this framework .",
    "the problem of the phase diagram sensitivity to the microscopic model also remains unsolved .",
    "the mean field theories @xcite and integral equation methods @xcite- reproduce different phase diagram types by varying the microscopic parameters but give qualitative estimates .    of special interest",
    "are refs.@xcite- @xcite devoted to the study of both the universal and nonuniversal properties .",
    "they are based on the previously proposed approach to the study of the gas - liquid critical point in a one - component fluid . , namely , the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) @xcite . on the microscopic hamiltonian grounds , the hrt develops the renormalization group structure near a critical point .",
    "recently this approach was also used for studying the 3d ising model @xcite .    in spite of the doubtless success of the hrt",
    "the problem remains of constructing a theory that allows within a unified approach a complete description of the phase behaviour of multicomponent continuous systems beginning with the hamiltonian and ending with the thermodynamic functions in the neighbourhood of the phase transition point .",
    "this program has already been accomplished in both the 3d ising model @xcite and a simple fluid near the gas - liquid critical point @xcite-@xcite . within the framework of the @xmath0 model",
    "this approach has permitted to obtain the non - classical critical exponents and analytical expressions for thermodynamic functions .",
    "this theory has its origin in the approach based on the functional representation of a partition function in the collective variables ( cv ) space @xcite .",
    "first the method of cv was proposed for a study of the charged particles systems@xcite-@xcite and then it was applied to the second order phase transition theory @xcite .",
    "the point is that the statistical description of the phase transition is to be performed in the appropriate phase space specific for a certain physical model . among the independent variables of this space",
    "there must be those connected with order parameters .",
    "this phase space forms a set of cv .",
    "each of them is a mode of density fluctuations corresponding to the specific feature of the model under consideration . in particular , for a magnetic system",
    "the cv are variables connected with spin density fluctuation modes , for a one - component fluid  with particle density fluctuation modes . what is the content of the cv for a multicomponent system ?",
    "we will answer this question below .",
    "experiments have shown that fluids and fluid mixtures near the ordinary critical points belong to the universality class of ising - like systems @xcite .",
    "thus , a study of critical properties of multicomponent systems requires , on the one hand , an extension of the method worked out for one - component fluids and , on the other hand , their further development . in @xcite",
    "we developed the cv method with a reference system ( rs ) for the case of a grand canonical ensemble for a multicomponent system . within the framework of this approach",
    "the phase diagram of a symmetrical mixture was examined in detail @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our previous study has been mainly restricted to the gaussian model .",
    "in @xcite we obtained the explicit form of the ginzburg - landau - wilson hamiltonian ( @xmath0 model ) for a binary symmetrical mixture in the vicinity of the gas - gas demixing critical point . in this paper",
    "we generalize the approach in the case of a non - symmetrical binary fluid system ( the system of different size particles interacting via different potentials ) .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "we give a functional representation of a grand partition function of a two - component system in section 2 .",
    "the physical nature of the order parameter in a binary mixture is discussed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we construct the basic density measure ( ginzburg - landau - wilson hamiltonian ) with respect to the cv which include a variable corresponding to the order parameter .",
    "let us consider a classical two - component system of interacting particles consisting of @xmath1 particles of species @xmath2 and @xmath3 particles of species @xmath4 .",
    "the system is in volume @xmath5 at temperature @xmath6 .",
    "let us assume that an interaction in the system has a pairwise additive character .",
    "the interaction potential between a @xmath7 particle at @xmath8 and a @xmath9 particle at @xmath10 may be expressed as a sum of two terms : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a potential of a short - range repulsion that will be chosen as an interaction between two hard spheres @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 is an attractive part of the potential which dominates at large distances .",
    "an arbitrary positive function belonging to the @xmath16 class can be chosen as the potential @xmath15 .",
    "further consideration of the problem is done in the extended phase space : in the phase space of the cartesian coordinates of the particles and in the cv phase space .",
    "an interaction connected with repulsion ( potential @xmath12 ) is considered in the space of the cartesian coordinates of the particles .",
    "we call this two - component hard spheres system a reference system ( rs ) .",
    "the interaction connected with an attraction ( potential @xmath15 ) is considered in the cv space .",
    "the phase space overflow is cancelled by introduction of the transition jacobian .",
    "the contribution of the short - range forces to the long - range interaction screening is ensured by averaging this jacobian over the rs .",
    "then a grand partition function in the cv representation with a rs can be written as ( for details see appendix  a ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the grand partition function of the rs .",
    "the thermodynamic and structural properties of the rs are assumed to be known .",
    "although it is known that mixtures with only repulsive interactions might undergo a phase transition @xcite , we assume that in the region of temperatures , concentrations and densities we are interested in , thermodynamic functions of the rs remain analytic .",

    "a choice of the order parameter in multicomponent fluid mixtures is a serious problem because the character of the phase transition can be changing continuously from the pure gas - liquid transition to the mixing - demixing one .",
    "the question of the physical nature of the order parameter in binary fluid mixtures has been considered until recently from the point of view of both the phenomenological theory @xcite and the microscopic approach @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "nowdays the commonly accepted idea is that both the gas - liquid and mixing - demixing phase transitions are accompanied by total density fluctuations as well as by relative density ( or concentration ) fluctuations .",
    "this is the only symmetrical mixture which exibits a complete distinction between these two processes @xcite .",
    "however , most likely such an `` ideal '' system does not occur in reality . in real mixtures",
    "the contribution from each type of the fluctuation processes changes along the critical curve .",
    "the evaluation of such contributions at each critical curve point is essential to the definition of the order parameter and to the understanding of the phase transition character in the mixture .",
    "it seems to us that in our approach the question of the physical nature of the order parameter has a consistent and clear solution .",
    "here we shall briefly focus on it .",
    "let us consider a gaussian approximation of functional integral ( [ a2.1])-([a2.6 ] ) .",
    "this approximation , also known as the random - phase approximation , yields the correct qualitative picture of the phenomena under consideration . as the result of the integration over variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 ,",

    ", we have to find such a cv @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) which is connected with the order parameter .",
    "index @xmath52 must correspond to the point of minimum of one of the functions @xmath53 or @xmath54 ( or both ) .",
    "these functions depend on temperature , attractive potentials @xmath55 and characteristics of the rs .",
    "the rs enters into ( [ b3.5 ] ) by cumulants @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath56 can be expressed by the fourier transforms of the direct correlation functions @xmath57 by means of the ornstein - zernike equations for a mixture . in @xcite",
    "the analytic solution of the percus - yevick equation for a hard sphere binary mixture was obtained .",
    "coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 are studied both as wave vector functions at different values of temperature @xmath6 , density @xmath58 and concentration @xmath59 including the gas - liquid and mixing - demixing critical points ( see fig .",
    "1 ) @xcite and as temperature functions at @xmath60 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) @xcite .",
    "the results show that branch @xmath53 becomes a critical one no matter whether the system approaches the gas - liquid or gas - gas demixing critical point .",
    "moreover , @xmath53 and @xmath54 have the minima at @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "hence we can draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "branch @xmath53 is always critical . 2 .",
    "because @xmath53 has the minimum at @xmath60 , the cv connected with the order parameter is @xmath61 in the case of the gas - liquid critical point as well as in the case of the mixing - demixing phase transition .",
    "the particular form of @xmath61 for each of these phenomena can be determined by means of the relations between the microscopic parameters , temperature , density and concentration of the system , e.g. by means of coefficients @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   in the plane",
    "@xmath66 we have distinguished two directions : the direction of strong fluctuations @xmath61 and the direction of weak fluctuations @xmath67 . as a result , we can write the conditions for the binary mixture critical point in the form : @xmath68_{c}&=&0 , \\label{b3.6a}\\\\ \\big[\\frac{\\partial^{2}\\omega}{\\partial\\eta_{0}\\partial\\xi_{0}}\\big]_{c}&=&0 , \\label{b3.6b}\\\\ \\big[\\frac{\\partial^{3}\\omega}{\\partial\\eta_{0}^{3}}\\big]_{c}&=&0 , \\label{b3.6c}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is a grand canonical potential .",
    "now let us consider equations ( [ b3.3 ] ) at @xmath70 . from ( [ b3.3 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath71 where the upper sign corresponds to the case @xmath72 and the lower sign corresponds to @xmath73 on the other hand , ( [ b3.7 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath74 comparing ( [ b3.7 ] ) and ( [ b3.9 ] ) we can determine rotation angle @xmath75 of axes @xmath61 and @xmath67 in the @xmath66 plane from the equation @xmath76 ( in both cases ( [ b3.8a ] ) and ( [ b3.8b ] ) ) . in the case ( [ b3.8b ] ) transformation ( [ b3.9 ] ) corresponds to both the mirror image with respect to the @xmath77 axis and the rotation in the @xmath66 plane .",
    "thus , the proposed approach allows us , on microscopic grounds , to define the order parameter at each point along a critical curve and so to understand the phase transition character in the binary mixture .",
