    "consequently , much effort has gone into the calculation of the new exponent @xmath11 and studying its properties .",
    "there have also been several experimental studies of the persistence exponent @xmath11 in real life systems@xcite .    a particulary important class of systems",
    "whose persistence behaviour has been investigated are spatially extended systems with a stochastic field @xmath21 at each lattice site @xmath22 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath21 is coupled to that of its neighbouring sites .",
    "@xmath21 could be , for instance , an ising spin@xcite , a phase ordering field@xcite , a diffusing field@xcite or the height of a fluctuating interface@xcite .",
    "the persistence probability @xmath17 is then the fraction of sites @xmath22 where @xmath21 has not flipped sign till time @xmath4 .",
    "recently it was observed that the set of persistent sites form a fractal and the time evolution of their spatial correlations obey dynamic scaling @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is the investigation of these spatial correlations .    for concreteness",
    ", we study the one - dimensional @xmath1 model .",
    "our primary motivation for this choice is the simplicity of the dynamics of the model which makes an analytic approach possible .",
    "in addition , this model is closely related to the @xmath23 glauber - ising model , which is perhaps the only non - trivial model where @xmath11 is known exactly .",
    "we study the distribution of the separations between nearest neigbour pairs of persistent sites .",
    "we call this the empty interval distribution @xmath2 , defined as the number of occurences where consecutive persistent sites are separated by distance @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "this quantity is a direct probe of spatial correlations in the distribution of particles . if the particles are distributed at random with some average density @xmath24 , then @xmath25 at all @xmath3 .",
    "any slower mode of decay is indicative of spatial correlations .    in this paper",
    ", we study the time evolution of the size distribution @xmath2 of these empty intervals .",
    "persistence decay is identified with the irreversible coalescence of these intervals .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we write a rate equation for the coalesence of these intervals under the approximation that the lengths of adjacent intervals are uncorrelated ( iia ) .",
    "we give phenomenological arguments about the asymptotically relevant dynamical length scale as well as the coalescence probability .",
    "these arguments , combined with the rate equation gives the dynamic scaling behaviour of @xmath2 at late times @xmath4 .",
    "we compare our predictions with numerical results . in section iii , we use the iia to predict the two - point correlations in the distribution of persistent sites .",
    "the predictions are found to be in agreement with recent numerical results , showing that iia is valid .",
    "in the @xmath1 model , a set of particles are distributed at random on the lattice with average density @xmath26 . over one time step ,",

    ". empty intervals ( which we will call ` interval ' for simplicity henceforth ) are defined as the separations between two consecutive persistent sites . by definition ,",
    "an interval can not contain a persistent site , although it may contain one or more diffusing particles @xmath0 . the total number ( per site ) of intervals of length @xmath3 at time @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath2 and is called the empty interval distribution .    to start with ,",

    "@xmath2 evolves satisfying the following normalisation conditions .",
    "if @xmath34 is the @xmath35-th moment of the distribution , then    @xmath36    the first condition follows from the definition of @xmath2 , the second one implies length conservation and the third condition gives the mean interval size @xmath37 .",
    "the probability distribution of interval lengths is @xmath38 so that @xmath39 .",
    "two neighbouring intervals can coalesce when the persistent site between them is destroyed by a diffusing particle at the boundary of either of the intervals .",
    "note that this coalescence process is irreversible . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only binary coalescence in a single time step where two adjacent intervals of lengths @xmath40 and @xmath41 , separated by a persistent site , coalesce and form a new interval of length @xmath42 when the persistent site is ` killed ' by a particle ( fig .",
    "i ) . to study this process analytically ,",
    "we invoke a mean - field approximation  the lengths of adjacent intervals are treated as uncorrelated random variables with probability distribution @xmath43 .",
    "this is the independent interval approximation ( iia ) , which has been used to study a variety of problems in one dimension@xcite .      assuming that iia is valid , the time evolution of @xmath2 is given by the rate equation    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the probability that two adjacent intervals of lengths @xmath46 and @xmath47 coalesce at time @xmath4 .",
    "the first term in eq.[eq : master ] represents the increase in number of intervals of size @xmath3 through coalescence of smaller intervals , while the second term is the loss term representing the decrease in number when intervals of size @xmath3 merge with other intervals .    to solve the above equation for @xmath2 , one need to know the form of the reaction kernel @xmath45 .",
    "the process of coalescence of intervals involves the destruction of the persistent site in between them by a particle , which can come from either of the intervals .",

    "it is also known that the particle distribution is correlated over length scales @xmath54 , wheras it is completely random over @xmath55@xcite .",
    "so we expect that for @xmath56 , @xmath57 , independent of @xmath35 .",
