    "multi - band observations of galaxies are becoming increasingly important for a coherent understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the increasing availability of wide field surveys at different wavelengths ( e.g. galex , spitzer , 2mass , sdss , 2df ) provides a wealth of data to better constrain the evolution of galaxies by analyzing it from several physical standpoints . in the last decade , wide area surveys have evidenced a strong evolution of some galaxy properties with redshift , particularly those related to star formation and dust attenuation .",
    "in particular , the local star formation rate density was found to be far lower than it was at @xmath4 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ; madau et al . 1996 ; flores et al . 1999 ; hopkins 2004 ) , although there is no clear agreement on the epoch where it was maximum ( heavens et al .",
    "a strong evolution of luminosities with redshift is also suggested by the study of the rest frame ultraviolet ( uv ; arnouts et al .",
    "2005 ) and rest frame infrared ( ir ; xu 2000 ; chary & elbaz 2001 ; le floch et al .",
    "2005 ) luminosity functions at different redshifts .",
    "the overall dust attenuation in star forming galaxies also shows signatures of evolution with redshift .",
    "takeuchi et al . (",
    "2005a ) have reported a strong decrease in the ratio of the ir to uv star formation rate ( sfr ) densities ( @xmath5 ) between @xmath6 and @xmath7 , which can be interpreted as a decrease over this redshift range in the dust attenuation of galaxies averaged over a volume element .",
    "the situation is far from clear when individual galaxies are studied .",
    "buat et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and xu et al .",
    "( 2007 ) report a slightly lower dust attenuation for lirgs at @xmath8 compared to lirgs at @xmath7 which seems not to be true for ulirgs ( xu et al .",
    "burgarella et al .",
    "( 2007 ) reported a lower dust attenuation ( as measured from the ir / uv ratio ) for lbgs at @xmath9 , compared to the sample of uv selected local galaxies of buat et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , and these lbgs are more attenuated than the sample of reddy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) at @xmath10 .",
    "another quantity which has been extensively studied is the specific sfr ( ssfr ) , which is defined as the ratio of the sfr to the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "this ssfr is now used to study the downsizing phenomenon ",
    "i.e. when @xmath11 decreases intense star formation activity becomes limited to less and less massive galaxies  from @xmath12 to present time ( e.g. cowie et al .",
    "1996 ; heavens et al . 2004 ; brinchmann & ellis 2000 ; boselli et al .",
    "2001 ; bauer et al . 2005 ; feulner et al .",
    "high mass galaxies with values of ssfr as high as those of low mass galaxies have been reported in the local universe , most of them being lirgs and/or ulirgs ( hammer et al . 2005 ; iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2006 ; buat et al .",
    "2006 ) , but they are far less numerous than the massive galaxies with negligible star formation activity . another interesting result reported by bell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) is that the ssfr of high mass galaxies was much higher at @xmath13 than in the local universe and could be responsible for the steep decrease in the sfr density from this epoch to the present one .",
    "synthetic templates of star forming galaxies have demonstrated to be powerful tools to derive star formation related properties of galaxies , especially in the wavelength range uv - to - nir ( e.g. leitherer & heckman 1999 ; bruzual & charlot 2003 ; fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) .",
    "furthermore , many efforts have been devoted to model the properties of the dust emission in star forming galaxies ( e.g. dale et al .",
    "2001 ; chary & elbaz 2001 ; rowan - robinson et al .",

    "we derive properties of a sample of uv selected galaxies by fitting multi - band data to a set of grasil ( silva et al .",
    "1998 ) templates in a statistical way , similar to what has been done for other samples of galaxies by using uv - to - optical templates ( e.g. kauffmann et al . 2003 ) or uv - to - optical templates plus a total ir luminosity ( burgarella et al . 2005 ) built from other population synthesis codes .",
    "we obtain mean star formation related properties at different redshift bins and explore the likely evolution of these properties with redshift .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in   2 the multi - band dataset is described .",
    "the main properties of the synthetic models are explained in   3 .",
    "the fitting method and the determination of the parameters are described in   4 and 5 respectively . ",

    "7 . throughout this paper",
    "we will use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath14  km  s@xmath15  mpc@xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "our dataset contains multi - wavelength ( uv to fir ) photometric data of galaxies in the elais fields .",
    "the uv data were taken by galex ( martin et al .",
    "2005a ) and consist of 19 circular frames ( 0.6  deg radius ) in the elaisn1 and elaisn2 fields , observed through two filters with the bandpass centered at 1530  ( fuv ) and 2315  ( nuv ) .",
    "in this paper we use only nuv photometry , since fuv photometry is available only for a few of these frames .",
    "the final frames were the result of the co - add of different observations with typical total exposure times of @xmath18  s. the nuv photometry used in this paper corresponds to the galex second data release ( available at http://galex.stsci.edu/gr2/ ) .",
    "table  [ galex_frames ] shows the coordinates and exposure times of the galex frames used in this work .",
    "the optical to fir data correspond to the spitzer wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) survey and consist of 12-band photometry : @xmath19 taken at int2.5 m with the wfc ; 3.6@xmath20m,4.5@xmath20m,5.8@xmath20m,8.0@xmath20 m from spitzer / irac ; and 24@xmath20m,70@xmath20m,160@xmath20 m from spitzer / mips .",
    "in addition , photometric redshifts are provided for all the galaxies on the list . throughout this paper ,",
    "the merged catalog ( version june 2005 , rowan - robinson , private communication ) was used .",
    "details on the photometry of the swire sources and on the quality of the photometric redshifts are given in rowan - robinson et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter rr05 ) .",
    "this work intends to study the properties of a uv selected sample of galaxies so we focused on the galex frames and selected all the sources with @xmath21  mag .",
    "sources located out of the inner 0.5  degree radius from the center of the galex frames were rejected since going to larger distances from the center can introduce spurious detections and ghosts that often appear close to the border .",
    "the angular resolution of the galex frames ( fwhm @xmath22  ) does not allow a proper star / galaxy separation , thus a cross - correlation between the uv and swire catalogs was performed .",
    "all the galex sources for which a single swire source ( classified galaxy in the @xmath23 and @xmath24 bands ) is present in a circle of a 2  radius were included in our sample . in order to avoid confused detections due to the different angular resolution of the galex and ( swire ) optical frames , those uv sources for which more than one optical detection was present within a circle of radius 6  were excluded from the final sample . in this way , a magnitude limited uv selected sample of galaxies free of confusion effects was built .",
    "both , the 6  isolation condition previously mentioned and the cross - correlation with the swire catalog may prevent a pure uv selection of our sample due to two reasons : ( a ) we may lose closely interacting galaxies and mergers which are either not resolved in the nuv frames ( but they do in the swire catalog ) or are so close that they break the 6  isolation condition ; and ( b ) the swire catalog contains only sources which were detected at both @xmath24 and 3.6@xmath20 m , which means that our final sample could lack blue galaxies included in our original nuv list but not detected either at @xmath24 or at 3.6@xmath20 m",
    ". however , the completeness limits at 3.6@xmath20 m ( 3.7@xmath20jy ) and @xmath24 ( 23  vega mag ) are much deeper than our nuv survey so including only swire sources classified as galaxies does not introduce any bias in the sample ( see xu et al .",
    "2007 for a discussion on this point ) . also shown in figure  [ counts ] are the nuv counts derived from our sample compared to those of xu et al .",
    "as can be seen , both sets of counts are consistent within the errors .",
    "thus , we conclude that the selection procedure does not include significant biases and for practical reasons , our uv selected sample can be considered complete down to @xmath25  abmag .    in the end we selected 6980 galaxies with ( photometric ) redshifts in the interval @xmath0 .",
    "there are several reasons for this redshift restriction : firstly , the relative uncertainty of the photometric redshifts increases as they approach 0 ( see rr05 for details ) , which will surely induce large uncertainties in the derived parameters dependent on redshift ; secondly , buat et al . (",
    "2006 ) have already analyzed the properties of a uv selected sample of galaxies at @xmath26 ; finally , going to higher values of redshift would increase the number of non detections , mainly at ir wavelengths , and this fact would hamper our analysis .",
    "figure  [ histo_red ] shows the redshift distribution of our sample galaxies and table  [ comple ] the fractions of detected galaxies at all the available bands .",
    "although a uv selected sample of galaxies is expected to be dominated by star forming galaxies , we can not neglect the possibility of some contamination due to the presence of agns . in order to estimate the fraction of agns",
    ", we use the classification of rr05 . in that paper",
    "the authors fitted the data using a set of 8 empirical optical - mir templates corresponding to e , sab , sbc , scd , sdm , sburst , agn1 and agn2 .",
    "figure  [ tem_opt ] shows the distribution of their best fit templates for our 6980 galaxies .",
    "as can be seen , only about 0.4% of the galaxies were classified as agn by rr05 .",
    "in addition , less than 4% of the galaxies were classified as e , the rest of them being classified as spirals or starbursts .",
    "this result supports the fact that from the optical point of view our sample is dominated by star forming galaxies , with very low contamination from agns and ellipticals .",
    "a set of synthetic templates of seds were computed with the code grasil .",
    "this code treats with particular care the effects of a dusty interstellar medium for different geometries of the dust and stars and is coupled with a chemical evolution code ( che_evo ) that takes into account in a consistent way the chemical evolution of the galaxy and the star formation history .",
    "this code describes one - zone open models depending only on time , including the infall of primordial gas .",
    "a more detailed description of this code can be found in silva et al .",
    "although grasil allows the variation of a large set of free parameters ( see silva et al .",
    "1998 for a detailed description of the code ) , to build our grid of templates only a small subset of parameters were varied ( silva , private communication ) .",
    "the values spanned by the free parameters were chosen so that they cover the values proposed by silva et al .",
    "( 1998 ) to reproduce the seds of star forming galaxies of different hubble types in the local universe ( see silva et al .",
    "1998 for details on fits to spiral and starburst galaxies ) .",
    "* the sfr was assumed to follow a schmidt - type law of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the gas mass at any time , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is a free parameter varying from @xmath31 to @xmath32 .",
    "* gas is continuously infalling at a rate proportional to @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a free parameter taking values from 0.1 to 21.6  gyr .",
    "these values extend above and below the typical values found for the milky way by boissier & prantzos ( 1999 ) : @xmath35  gyr at @xmath36  kpc , and @xmath37  gyr at @xmath38  kpc .",
    "grasil does not allow us to vary infall rates with the distance to the center of the galaxy , so single values are adopted for each model .",
    "* grasil also allows the addition at any time of an analytical extra star formation law ( simulating a burst of star formation ) combined with a schmidt law .",
    "we chose an exponentially declining functional form with declining timescale equal to 50  myr .",
    "for comparison , kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and salim et al .",
    "( 2005 ) use bursts of constant intensity between 30 and 300  myr after the beginning of the burst .",
    "four intensities of the burst were allowed in our work , corresponding to 0.33% , 1% , 3% and 9% of the total mass infall .",
    "* grasil assumes two components of the interstellar medium ( ism ) : the molecular clouds  containing the young stars and a dense ism  , and the diffuse gas ( cirrus )  containing stars that escaped from the molecular clouds ( free stars ) and a diffuse ism . the typical time required to escape the molecular clouds , @xmath39 , is also a free parameter that we let vary from 1 to @xmath40  yr , a value consistent with the one used by charlot & fall ( 2000 ) and panuzzo et al .",
    "an escape time of @xmath41  yr is able to reproduce the seds of some local spiral galaxies ( silva et al .",
    "the optical depth of the molecular clouds , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the mass and radii of the molecular clouds respectively , was taken as another free parameter in our set of templates .",
    "we fixed @xmath45  pc and let @xmath46 vary from @xmath47 to @xmath48  m@xmath49 .",
    "these values are close to the ones measured by rosolowsky et al .",

    "grasil allows us to stop the evolution of the galaxy at any time , so that galaxies of different ages can be simulated .",
    "we assumed that all galaxies are coeval with an age of @xmath50  gyr .",
    "for the redshift interval selected in this work , and given that seds are almost insensitive to small age differences , we produced models of 8 and 12  gyr . *",
    "the inclination angle of the galaxies may play a role in the observed sed of a galaxy , since the more inclined a galaxy is , the more attenuated it appears at uv and optical wavelengths .",
    "this may result in an incorrect derivation of the dust attenuation and star formation related parameters .",
    "although we lack available information on the inclination angles for our galaxies , we generated models corresponding to inclination angles of 15@xmath51 , 45@xmath51 and 75@xmath51 .",
    "in all our models , stars and gas are distributed following exponential disks with scale length 4  kpc and scale height 0.4  kpc .",
    "these values are of the order of the ones reported for large samples of spiral galaxies ( de jong et al .",
    "1996 ; yoachim & dalcanton 2006 ) although other authors report slightly higher values for the scale height ( barteldrees & dettmar 1994 ) .",
    "the assumed fraction of molecular gas is 50% , which is rather high but still reasonable for star forming galaxies ( boselli et al . 2002 ) .",
    "finally , the dust to gas ratio is assumed to be proportional to the metallicity and normalized to the milky way value at solar metallicity .",
    "our database is composed of a total of 5127 templates .",
    "table  [ templates ] lists the free parameters of the templates used in this paper .",
    "the evaluation of the total ir luminosity between 8 and 1000@xmath20 m ( @xmath52 ) is a potential source of uncertainty , mainly when almost no detections at fir wavelengths and detections at 24@xmath20 m for only about half of the sources are available , as is the case for our dataset .",
    "for this reason , we prefer to be consistent with previous observational results and we restrict our models to those which satisfy the following relations : @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the monochromatic luminosities at 8 , 25 and 60@xmath20 m respectively .",
    "these three observational constraints have been reported by caputi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and takeuchi et al .",
    "( 2005b ) and hold over several orders of magnitude . in order to account for the dispersions found around these relations , we allow models to deviate by a factor of 3 above and below these average relations . we note that whereas two of these relations are found for local galaxies ( takeuchi et al .",
    "2005b ) , the one by caputi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) holds for galaxies at @xmath59 .",
    "thus , by applying these local relations to our models we assume that the ir seds are suitable to estimate the total ir luminosities of higher redshift galaxies , as seems to be the case ( egami et al .",
    "2004 ; le floch et al . 2005 ; marcillac et al .",
    "2006 ) .    in order to show how our models reproduce the seds of the sample galaxies from the uv up to the ir , in figures  [ gr_ri_z0p25 ] to [ nuvg_gr_z0p25 ]",
    "several observed color - color plots for the galaxies and for the templates at different redshifts are presented .",
    "the observed colors involving only optical bands ( figure  [ gr_ri_z0p25 ] ) are properly reproduced by the models at any redshift .",
    "the fraction of galaxies located at distances larger than 0.2  mag from any template is lower than 3% at all redshifts . concerning the observed colors involving optical and ir data ( figure  [ gr_r3p6_z0p25 ] ) the situation is quite similar , with less than 4% of the galaxies more distant than 0.2  mag to any template .",
    "however , the situation is less favourable for the observed colors involving the nuv fluxes , as is shown in figure  [ nuvg_gr_z0p25 ] . in this case , the fraction of galaxies showing @xmath60 colors not reproduced by the models to an accuracy of 0.2  mag increases from 5% for @xmath61 $ ] to 25% for @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy between data and models is not clear . a careful revision of the most extreme cases yields nuv fluxes much larger ( compared to their optical fluxes ) than those expected for star forming galaxies .",
    "the median nuv fluxes of the discrepant galaxies are similar to that of the total sample , so photometric uncertainties can be discarded as the only reason for this effect . in any case , the total number of discrepant galaxies is less than 10% , therefore most of the galaxies can be properly fitted by the models .",

    "the distributions of galaxies in region ( b ) , are consistent with being drawn from the same population at the 95% confidence level , so no evolution with redshift is reported for them .",
    "figure  [ histo_lbol](a ) shows that the histograms of @xmath83 for region ( a ) are shifted towards higher values as redshift decreases , which suggests that low total luminosity galaxies  region ( a )  with low values of @xmath83 become scarce at low values of @xmath11 .",
    "this decreasing presence of galaxies with low @xmath83 as redshift decreases is not seen for high total luminosity galaxies  region ( b )  as the kolmogorov - smirnov test states and figure  [ histo_lbol](b ) suggests .",
    "the evolution of the dust attenuation with the stellar mass is also studied .",
    "figure  [ mstar_lirlfuv ] shows @xmath3 vs. @xmath83 at different redshifts is also studied .",
    "again we are only limited by our uv selection because the rest of the relevant parameters ( @xmath3 , @xmath52 ) are derived from the templates after fitting to the observational data .",
    "the only limit in figure  [ mstar_lirlfuv ] at a given redshift is a minimum @xmath3 associated to the minimum @xmath76 imposed by the uv selection .",
    "thus , the distribution of stellar masses represented in this figure corresponds to that of a uv selected sample and does not intend to be complete down to any value of @xmath3 .    in figure  [ mstar_lirlfuv_mean ]",
    "the volume weighted average @xmath3 vs. @xmath83 at the different redshifts is shown .",
    "the average and standard deviation ( corresponding to the error bars in the figure ) values have been estimated as in buat et al . (",
    "2006 ) :    @xmath101    and @xmath102 where @xmath103 for galaxy @xmath104 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath83 increases with stellar mass at all redshifts for galaxies with @xmath105  m@xmath49 .",
    "a galaxy with @xmath106  m@xmath49 shows @xmath83 a factor of @xmath107 higher at @xmath108 than at @xmath109 . this difference is lower for a galaxy with @xmath110  m@xmath49 , a factor of @xmath111 . for galaxies with @xmath1  m@xmath49",
    "the trend seems to flatten and @xmath83 reaches an almost constant value with redshift .",
    "the plot also shows that for galaxies more massive than @xmath112 the evolutionary trend of @xmath83 seems to invert in the sense that it decreases with redshift . whether this effect is real or not is still to be confirmed since the statistics are scarce for this last mass bin .",
    "a tentative explanation of this evolution of @xmath83 with the stellar mass could be associated with the total dust content of star forming galaxies , which is linked to the metallicity .",
    "a mass  metallicity relation has been reported at different redshifts in the sense that more massive galaxies are also more metal rich ( zaritsky et al .",
    "1994 , tremonti et al .",
    "we also find that at a fixed stellar mass , the dust attenuation increases as redshift decreases .",
    "this result is consistent with the findings of savaglio et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and erb et al .",
    "( 2006 ) that for a given stellar mass , galaxies were less metallic at high redshift than they are at present time .",
    "this result suggests a mass dependent rate of chemical enrichment for galaxies that can be explained by invoking a mass dependent star formation history .",
    "in fact , n - body simulations by brooks et al .",
    "( 2007 ) claim that low star formation efficiencies are required for low mass galaxies in order to explain the mass  metallicity relation .",
    "we can estimate the star formation efficiency of our galaxies through the fitted parameters of grasil .",
    "the @xmath30 parameter is the main driver of the sfr when we assume a schmidt - type law ( eq .  1 ) .",
    "low values of @xmath30 allow a fairly flat sfh until the present epoch .",
    "on the contrary , high values of @xmath30 imply a very intense star formation activity in the first epochs of a galaxy followed by a steep decrease of the sfr due to a quick exhaustion of the gas reservoir .",
    "this decrease in the sfr of massive galaxies has already been reported by bell et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , juneau et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and pannella et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for different samples of galaxies from @xmath113 to present time .",
    "figure  [ mstar_nu ] shows the relation between m * and @xmath30 for our galaxies .",
    "it is apparent that low mass galaxies show lower values of @xmath30 while the opposite holds for high mass galaxies . with this downsizing picture in mind",
    "we can explain the differential evolution of dust attenuation as partially linked to the sfh of galaxies : high mass galaxies experience a first epoch of intense star formation activity , thus they will efficiently increase their metal ( and dust ) content . as the sfr begins to decline up to the present epoch the metal enrichment becomes slower as does the dust production .",
    "conversely , low mass galaxies show almost constant star formation efficiencies , which translate into moderate but continuously increasing chemical enrichment and dust production .",
    "to illustrate this hypothesis the volume weighted metallicity evolution for different bins of m * is shown in figure  [ zeta_mass ] .",
    "metallicities have been computed by the chemical evolutionary code che_evo coupled to grasil in a consistent way with the rest of the parameters , and we remind the reader that in our models the dust to gas fraction was assumed to be proportional to metallicity . as can be seen , whereas for galaxies with @xmath114 $ ] the metallicity increases by a factor of @xmath115 from @xmath108 to @xmath109 , for galaxies with @xmath116 $ ] the increasing factor is @xmath117 .",
    "thus the evolution of @xmath83 observed in figure  [ mstar_lirlfuv_mean ] could be understood in terms of an evolution of metallicity .",
    "the specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) is defined as @xmath118 , that is , the ratio of the current sfr to the total stellar mass produced throughout the galaxy s lifetime .",
    "it is related to the birthrate parameter @xmath119 ( defined as @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is the averaged sfr throughout the galaxy s lifetime ) , but it does not depend on the timescale required to build all the stellar mass . if we assume that the sfr of the galaxy will remain almost constant for a long period of time , the ssfr is equivalent to the inverse of the time required by a galaxy to double its stellar mass .",
    "figure  [ mstar_ssfr ] shows the ssfr as a function of the stellar mass .",
    "the observational limits are indicated with dashed lines .",
    "the limits correspond to the minimum stellar mass and sfr allowed for each @xmath76 of our sample .",
    "the horizontal lines in each panel indicate the ssfr required for a galaxy to double its stellar mass from each epoch to present time assuming constant sfr . it is found that less massive galaxies tend to have a larger ssfr , consistent with the scenario already reported by several authors ( cowie et al .",

    ", the ssfr is found to decrease with redshift .",
    "the slope of the variation of the ssfr with m * as well as the rate of decline of ssfr with @xmath11 for different stellar masses are clues to understand the origin of the downsizing process .",
    "we find a shallower variation of ssfr versus m * ( i.e. a larger ssfr for massive galaxies ) as compared to other works aimed at studying the evolution of the ssfr - m * variation and covering ( at least ) the same redshift range ( e.g. feulner et al .",
    "2005 , bauer et al .",
    "2005 , zheng et al .",
    "2007 ) . from figure  [ mstar_ssfr_volumen ] ,",
    "the ssfr is also found to decrease by a larger factor for massive galaxies than for low mass ones from @xmath122 to @xmath7 . as an example",
    ", the ssfr lowers by a factor of @xmath117 from @xmath123 to @xmath124 for galaxies more massive than @xmath125  m@xmath49 , whereas this factor is of the order of 4 for galaxies with @xmath126  m@xmath49 .",
    "this result differs from the recent findings of zheng et al .",
    "( 2007 ) who conclude a similar decrease of ssfr with redshift for all stellar masses from @xmath127 to present time .",
    "in this respect , the wavelength at which samples are selected may introduce some bias on the obtained results . to illustrate this point ,",
    "figure  [ secuencia ] shows @xmath3 vs. rest frame @xmath128 for our galaxies .",
    "the lines separating the red and blue sequences at the different redshifts ( from bell et al .",
    "2007 ) are shown in separated panels .",
    "as can be seen , the majority of our galaxies belong to the blue sequence at all redshifts and almost no signs of any color bimodality are found ( e.g. strateva et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the uv selection applied to our sample .",
    "contrary to that , the sample of elbaz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) selected at rest frame optical wavelengths shows a clear bimodality in the color magnitude plot .",
    "the same is found by bell et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for their sample selected at optical magnitudes .",
    "these authors also show that red galaxies show a steeper relation between @xmath3 and ssfr than blue ones . from a general point of view",
    ", care should be taken when comparing star formation related properties from samples selected with different criteria since the results will depend on the fraction of red to blue galaxies of each sample .",
    "in particular , our results show that uv selected samples are extremely efficient at selecting blue galaxies .",
    "however , as has been shown in previous papers ( buat et al . 2005 ; iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2006 ) , a complete view of the evolution of star forming galaxies would require a sample of galaxies containing both the bright ( uv ) and dark ( ir ) sides of star formation .",
    "in this paper a study has been performed on the properties of a sample of uv selected galaxies at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the properties were inferred from the fit to a grid of synthetic models constructed with the code grasil through a bayesian analysis .",
    "most of the galaxies fit reasonably well to the models , which indicates that a schmidt - type law combined with recent bursts of star formation properly reproduces the observed seds of galaxies at this redshift range .",
    "it was found that , whereas low luminosity galaxies with low attenuation were significantly more numerous at high redshifts , this result is not seen for high luminosity galaxies . in the same way , dust attenuation is found to increase with decreasing redshift for galaxies with low @xmath3 , but this trend seems to disappear for galaxies with @xmath129 .",
    "this result is consistent with a mass dependent evolution of the dust to gas ratio , and thus of metallicity , which could be driven by a mass dependent star formation history of galaxies : the most massive galaxies have formed most of their stars by @xmath13 and thus their metallicity would not significantly change from @xmath122 to @xmath130 , and likewise their dust content .",
    "the opposite is found to hold for low mass galaxies , which experience a larger increase in metallicity over the same period , producing the reported evolution in the dust attenuation .",
    "the ssfr were found to decrease with increasing stellar mass , as has been known for many years ( e.g. cowie et al .",
    "1996 ) , and the trend holds at all redshifts explored in this work . assuming constant sfrs , the fraction of galaxies able to double their stellar masses from their epoch to the present time decreases with redshift . at @xmath131",
    "most of the galaxies with @xmath132 are above the doubling ",
    "mass line whereas the opposite is true for such massive galaxies at @xmath133",
    ". a shallower decrease of the ssfr with increasing stellar mass is found than reported in previously published studies in the same redshift range and based on visible - nir selections .",
    "this difference is likely to be due to the sample selections : whereas samples selected at optical / ir wavelengths include galaxies belonging to both the blue and red sequences , our uv selection is dominated by blue ( star forming ) galaxies .",
