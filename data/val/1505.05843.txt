    "determining the chemical composition of stars is one of the primary goals of astrophysics .",
    "such investigations help us to better understand the chemical enrichment of the galaxy and to make some assumptions about the mechanisms involved in element evolution in the interstellar medium , and in stellar atmospheres in particular @xcite . while studying the sun , the problem of the abundances of certain atoms necessitated a model to explain this .",
    "it was finally explained with the introduction of the pp- and cno- cycles in the interior of the sun .",
    "but this was not enough to explain the presence of large amounts of helium .",
    "the next step in studying the evolution of elements was the introduction of nucleosynthesis theory .",
    "modern scientific understanding is that chemical elements were formed as a result of the processes occurring in stars , leading to evolutionary changes of their physical conditions .",
    "therefore , the problem of nuclide formation is also closely related to the issue of the evolution of stars and planetary system .",
    "recently jenkins et al .",
    "@xcite announced the discovery of a low - mass planet orbiting the super hd77338 as part of our ongoing calan - hertfordshire extrasolar planet search @xcite .",
    "the best - fit planet solution has an orbital period of 5.7361 @xmath4 0.0015 days and with a radial velocity semi - amplitude of only 5.96@xmath41.74  ms@xmath5 , giving a minimum mass of @xmath6  m@xmath7 .",
    "the best - fit eccentricity from this solution is 0.09@xmath8 , and is in the agreement with results of a bayesian analysis and a periodogram analysis .    according to modern theory ,",
    "the formation of the nucleus of chemical elements from carbon to iron is the result of thermonuclear reactions involving he , c , o , ne and si in stars .",
    "after the depletion of hydrogen reserves , a star s core starts running a 3@xmath9 reaction , where it produces a number of elements as a result of the following transformations : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "+ after reaching a specific threshold temperature , carbon begins fusing with the formation of ne , na and mg :    @xmath13 , + @xmath14 , + @xmath15 .",
    "+ aluminum can then be produced by : @xmath16 .",
    "+ the combustion reaction of oxygen is a dual - channel process and causes the presence of al , s , p , si and mg . one of the channels is : + @xmath17 , + @xmath18 , + @xmath19 , + with continuous temperature growth , silicon burning is initiated .",
    "this process is described by a number of reactions . as a result",
    "we can receive , for example , ar , ni , s , etc .",
    "@xmath20 , after two @xmath21 decays , turns into @xmath22 .",
    "it is the final stage of the fusion of nuclides in massive stars , which forms the nucleus of the iron group .",
    "+ the production of heavy elements is provided by other mechanisms .",
    "they are called s- and r- processes .    * s - process or slow neutron capture : formation of heavier nuclei by lighter nuclei through successive neutron capture .",
    "the original element in the s - process is @xmath22 .",
    "the reaction chain ends with @xmath23 .",
    "it is thought that s - processes occur mostly in stars on the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "for the s - process to run , an important condition is the ability to produce neutrons .",
    "the main neutron source reactions are : @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "example of s - process reactions are : @xmath26    elements heavier than h and he are usually called metals in astrophysics . their concentration is significantly less , relative to hydrogen and helium , but they are the source of thousands of spectral lines originating from a star s atmosphere .",
    "the abundance of iron depends on a stars age and on its position in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "metal - rich stars are also known to be rich in orbiting giant exoplanets .",
    "high metallicity appears to be a major ingredient in the formation of planets through core accretion @xcite . +",
    "hd 77338 is one of the most metal - rich stars in the sample of @xcite and in the local solar neighborhood in general .",
    "its spectral type is given as k0iv in the hipparcos main catalogue @xcite .",
    "however , is not a subgiant , as labeled in hipparcos @xcite , its mass and radius are smaller than the sun s : m = 0.93 @xmath27 0.05 m@xmath28 , r = 0.88 @xmath27 0.04 r@xmath28 .",
    "a parallax of 24.54 @xmath27 1.06 mas for hd 77338 means the star is located at a distance of 40.75 @xmath4 1.76 pc .",
    "its effective temperature and surface gravity were found @xmath29 = 5370 @xmath27 80 k , log@xmath30 = 4.52 @xmath27 0.06 @xcite .",
    "more stellar parameters for hd 77338 and detailed information about its planetary system are in @xcite .",
    "using the simbad database one can find information on the previous assessments of abundances in the atmosphere of hd 77338 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) . in most cases",
    "the authors only determine the metallicity of the star , i.e. the iron abundance . in turn , we recomputed the abundances of many elements which show significant absorption lines in the observed spectrum of .",
    ".simbad s list of previous assessments of abundances in the atmosphere of hd 77338 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table  [ tab2 ] we present our results for 12 different ionic species .",
    "we compare our abundances with the solar values , obtained using a model atmosphere of 5777/4.44/0.00 .",
    "they are in good agreement with each other .",
    "[ fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] show the line profiles of cr and mg calculated using a @xmath31 = 0.75 km / s .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we show the dependence of [ x / h ] on atomic number of each element for every iteration .",
    "the presence of errors can be explained by the presence of noise in the selected spectral lines , along with only having a small number of lines to work with for some elements . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we present the dependence of [ x / fe ] for the final iteration , where different elements are shown using different plotting shapes depending on their mechanism of formation .",
    "we determined abundances for 12 ionic species in the atmosphere of the sun and the metal - rich exoplanet host star hd 77338 .",
    "our values for the solar abundances are in good agreement with results from previous authors , proving the validity of our method .",
    "we used the solar spectrum as a reference to select the proper list of absorption lines to be used later in the analysis of the spectrum .",
    "our [ x / h ] correlates well with the condensation temperature of the ions ( @xmath32 ) , see discussion in @xcite .",
    "this may indicate the presence of a common shell ( in the past ) and can be an additional criterion for the existence of a planetary system around metal - rich stars .",
    "we also computed @xmath33 for both stars .",
    "it is worth noting that we determined all parameters in the framework of a fully self - consistent approach ( see @xcite for more details ) . in general , lines of mn",
    ", cu can not be used to obtain @xmath33 because these lines usually have several close components , but in our case the parameter @xmath34 was used to adjust theoretical profiles to get the proper fits to the observed special features .",
    "we believe that fits to fe i lines provide reasonable measures of the rotational velocity .",
    "our results show that the abundances of most elements in the atmosphere can be described well by the overall metallicity . however , we found an overabundance of some of the iron peak elements ( e.g. mn , cu ) .",
    "interestingly , cu is an element formed through the s - process and its abundance follows that of fe , whereas zn and elements formed through the p - process , e.g. ni ( see http://www.mao.kiev.ua/staff/yp/txt/prs.png ) , show a noticeable overabundance compared to iron",
    ". it would be interesting to compare these results for with other metal rich stars to see if this is a common trend for super metal - rich stars .",
