    "structural credit risk models such as the first - passage - time models proposed by or are widely used in the analysis of defaultable corporate securities . in these models , a firm defaults if a random process @xmath0 representing the firm s asset value hits some threshold @xmath1 that is typically linked to value of the firm s liabilities .",
    "first - passage - time models offer an intuitive economic interpretation of the default event .",
    "however , in the practical application of these models a number of difficulties arise : to begin with , it might be difficult for investors in secondary markets to assess precisely the value of the firm s assets .",
    "moreover , for tractability reasons @xmath0 is frequently modelled as a diffusion process . in that case",
    "the default time @xmath2 is a predictable stopping time , which leads to unrealistically low values for short - term credit spreads . for these reasons",
    "proposed a model where secondary markets have only incomplete information on the asset value @xmath0 .",
    "more precisely they consider the situation where the market obtains at discrete time points @xmath3 a noisy accounting report of the form @xmath4 ; moreover , the market knows the default history of the firm .",
    "duffie and lando show that in this setting the default time @xmath2 admits an intensity that is proportional to the derivative of the conditional density of the asset value at the default threshold @xmath1 .",
    "this well - known result provides an interesting link between structural and reduced - form models .",
    "moreover , the result shows that by introducing incomplete information it is possible to construct structural models where short - term credit spreads take reasonable values .",
    "the subsequent work of discusses the pricing of the firm s equity in structural models with unobservable asset value .",
    "moreover , it is shown that the valuation of the firm s equity and debt leads to a stochastic filtering problem : one needs to determine the conditional distribution of the current asset value @xmath5 given the @xmath6-field @xmath7 representing the information available to the market at time @xmath8 .",
    "consider this problem in the setup of duffie and lando where new information on the asset value arrives only at discrete points in time .",
    "working with a markov - chain approximation approximation for @xmath0 they derive a recursive updating rule for the conditional distribution of the approximating markov chain via elementary bayesian updating ; the discrete nature of the information - arrival is crucial for their arguments .    neither nor study the price dynamics of traded securities under incomplete information .",
    "hence in these papers it is not possible to analyze the pricing and the hedging of derivative securities such as options on corporate bonds or on the stock .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is therefore to develop a proper theory of derivative asset analysis for structural credit risk models under incomplete information .",
    "more precisely , we make the following contributions .",
    "first , in order to obtain realistic price dynamics for the traded securities , we model the noisy observations of the asset value by a continuous time process of the form @xmath9 for some brownian motion @xmath10 independent of @xmath0 . we show that this leads to price processes with non - zero instantaneous volatility , whereas the discrete information arrival considered by duffie and lando or frey and schmidt generates asset prices that evolve deterministically between the news - arrival dates .",
    "moreover , modeling @xmath11 as a continuous time processes is in line with the standard literature on stochastic filtering such as .",
    "second , we show that in order to derive the price dynamics of traded securities we need to determine the dynamics of the conditional distribution of @xmath5 given @xmath12 . this is a challenging stochastic filtering problem , since under full observation , the default time @xmath2 is predictable .",
    "hence standard filtering techniques for point process observations such as the results from do not apply .",
    "we therefore transform the original problem to a new filtering problem where the observations consist only of the noisy asset information ; the signal process in this new problem is on the other hand given by the asset value process stopped at the first exit time of the solvency region @xmath13 . using results of on the filtering of stopped diffusion processes we derive a stochastic partial differential equation ( spde ) for the conditional density of @xmath5 given @xmath12 , denoted @xmath14 , and we discuss the numerical solution of this spde via a galerkin approximation . extending to our more general information structure ,",
    "we show that @xmath2 admits an intensity process @xmath15 such that the intensity at time @xmath8 is proportional to the spatial derivative of @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "armed with these results we finally study derivative asset analysis in our setup : we identify the price dynamics of the traded securities ; we consider the pricing of options on traded assets ; we derive risk - minimizing dynamic hedging strategies for these claims , and we discuss model calibration .",
    "the paper closes with a small simulation study illustrating the theoretical results .",
    "incomplete information and filtering methods have been used before in the analysis of credit risk .",
    "structural models with incomplete information were considered among others by , , , , and .",
    "the last contribution is related to the present paper . working in a similar setup as ours",
    ", cetin uses probabilistic arguments to establish the existence of a default intensity in the market filtration , and he derives the corresponding filter equations . he does not discuss the existence of the conditional density @xmath14 and financial applications are discussed only in a peripheral manner . from a purely mathematical point of view our paper is also closely related to who deal with the filtering of partially observed diffusions up to the first exit time of a domain .",
    "the relation between our results and those of krylov and wang are best explained once the mathematical details of our setup have been introduced , and we refer to section  [ sec : filtering ] , remark  [ rem : krylov ] for a deeper discussion of similarities and differences between the two papers .",
    "reduced - form credit risk models with incomplete information have been considered previously by , and , among others .",
    "the modelling philosophy of the present paper is inspired by , but the mathematical analysis differs substantially .",
    "in particular , in the default times of the firms under consideration do admit an intensity under full information . hence the filtering problem that arises in the pricing of credit derivatives can be addressed via a straightforward application of the innovations",
    "approach to nonlinear filtering .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we introduce the model ; the relation between traded securities and stochastic filtering is discussed in section  [ sec : pricing - basic - securities ] ; section  [ sec : filtering ] is concerned with the stochastic filtering of the asset value ; in section  [ sec : dynamics ] we derive the dynamics of corporate securities ; section  [ sec : applications ] is concerned with derivative asset analysis ; the results of numerical experiments are given in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",

    "more precisely , the set of traded securities consists so - called _ basic debt securities _ and of the stock of the firm .",
    "we now describe the payoff stream of these securities in more detail .",
    "first we refer to an asset as a _ basic debt security _ if its cash - flow stream can be expressed as a linear combination of the following two building blocks    * a _ survival claim _ with generic maturity date @xmath103 .",

    "using iterated conditional expectations we get that @xmath113 by the markov property of @xmath0 , for basic debt securities and for the stock the inner conditional expectation can be expressed as a function of time and of the current asset value @xmath5 , that is @xmath114 see below for details . the function @xmath115 is called the _ full - information value _ of the security . in section  [ sec : filtering ]",

    "second , in order to derive the price dynamics of traded securities under the risk - neutral measure @xmath20 we determine the dynamics of @xmath121 using filtering methods ; this gives the dynamics of the pre - default value @xmath122 of the traded securities .",
    "this approach is akin to the use of factor models in term structure modelling where prices of traded securities are used to estimate the current value of the factor process and where bond price dynamics are derived from the dynamics of the factor process . in fact , in section  [ subsec : derivatives ] it will be shown that in our setup the price at time @xmath8 of a non - path - dependent option on traded assets is a function of @xmath121 so that our model can be viewed as factor model with infinite - dimensional factor process @xmath121 .",
    "note that the modelling approach outlined above leads to filtering problems under the risk - neutral measure @xmath20 and that it is not necessary to associate @xmath11 with publicly observable economic data ; @xmath11 is simply an abstract representation of the continuously released economic information on the asset value .",
    "this differs from the ` classical ' application of stochastic filtering in statistical inference .",
    "a typical problem in the latter context would be as follows : the process @xmath11 is identified with a specific set of economic data that contains noisy information of @xmath0 and filtering techniques are employed to estimate the conditional distribution of @xmath5 under the historical measure @xmath123 given the observed trajectories of @xmath11 , @xmath78 and @xmath76 up to time @xmath8 .",
    "such an approach could be used to estimate the firm s real - world default probability , similar in spirit to the well - known public firm edf model  @xcite .",
