    "spin liquid phases are some of the most interesting phases known to exist theoretically .",
    "however they are hard to achieve experimentally because interactions usually favor ordered phases . to achieve spin liquid we have to frustrate these interactions .",
    "triangular lattice provides a natural way to do this . for the nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic heisenberg model",
    "the frustration is not strong enough and the ground state is ordered .",
    "however , the order is weak , and it is likely that in the presence of appropriate additional interactions , spin liquid phases arise .",
    "this work is motivated by the layered organic compound .@xcite it contains et molecules that pair up , each pair lies on sites of triangular lattice and has one electron less then the full filling .",
    "the material at ambient pressure is an insulator .",
    "thus it is effectively a spin 1/2 antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice . while the heisenberg exchange @xmath7  k , the system shows no signs of ordering down to @xmath8  mk making it a good candidate for the spin liquid .",
    "there are likely additional interactions among spins , especially ring exchanges that are thought to be responsible for driving the system into the spin liquid.@xcite what makes the appearance of such interactions natural is that under moderate pressure the  undergoes a transition to a superconductor at low temperature ( and a metal at higher temperature ) , so there are significant virtual charge fluctuations present already in the insulator at ambient pressure.@xcite crudely , we can think of the system as a half - filled hubbard model close to the mott insulator - metal transition , and we can estimate that the ring exchange interactions in the effective spin model are strong , enough to destroy the magnetic order .",
    "@xcite an alternative explanation of the insulator in terms of inhomogeneous electron localization has also been suggested .",
    "@xcite    the spin liquid phase remains enigmatic .",
    "thermodynamic measurements show many gapless excitations in this charge insulator  at least as many as in a metal .",
    "one appealing proposal that captures some of the observed phenomenology is a state with spinon fermi surface .",
    "@xcite other scenarios have also been suggested , @xcite particularly with the view towards low temperatures .",
    "we are specifically interested in the @xmath0c nmr measurements of the knight shifts,@xcite and what we can learn from these for the material and the spin liquid .",
    "the measurements effectively give a histogram of local magnetic susceptibility and are therefore a good probe of the magnetic properties .",
    "the experiment shows strong broadening of such histogram as one lowers the temperature .",
    "the width of the peak broadens by about a factor of 40 as the temperature is lowered from 250  k to roughly 1  k and saturates as the temperature is lowered further .",
    "the distribution of local susceptibilities can be produced by disorder , since the susceptibility can have various values as a function of distance from say an impurity .",
    "it is hard to imagine other mechanism producing a distribution ( except spin glass , but no such behavior is observed ) .",
    "therefore in this paper we investigate the effects of disorder on the spin system .",
    "unfortunately , not much is known about the impurities and their role in the insulating  at ambient pressure . at high pressure of 0.8  gpa ,",
    "the material is a relatively clean metal with @xmath9 and observable shubnikov - dehaas oscillations .",
    "it is believed that the cu@xmath10 impurity concentration is very low,@xcite less than 0.01% .",
    "there are quite possibly additional sources of disorder such as different local environments coming from different conformations of the et molecules , @xcite or from disorder in the insulating anion layers such as the disordered ( cn)@xmath11 group.@xcite analyzing the nmr experiments can then provide some understanding of the disorder , its strength , and role in the insulator phase . taking up the mott insulator picture as one viable candidate , where the insulator is primarily driven by electron - electron interactions",
    ", we set out to study models of non - magnetic disorder in a spin-1/2 system on the triangular lattice .",
    "we study progressively different kinds of disorder and analyze what each predicts about the local susceptibilities in turn .",
    "this paper consists of two separate approaches : one , the high temperature series expansion , and the other , low temperature analysis assuming the system forms a spin liquid .",
    "high temperature series expansion is rather restricted by the range of temperatures and the types of models it can study , but for those models it gives exact results .",
    "we are able to calculate local susceptibilities of the nearest neighbor heisenberg model on an arbitrary graph where all exchange couplings are the same .",
    "in particular , we can study triangular lattice with a missing site , with a boundary , or in the presence of a finite density of missing sites .",
    "the missing sites are models of nonmagnetic impurities , while the boundary is a model of grain boundary .",
    "we can go down to temperature of roughly @xmath4 . in this range",
    ", the experiments already see broadening of the knight shift distribution by about a factor of two and thus we can compare the calculated results to the experiments . of course , the real material has interactions beyond the nearest neighbor since it is a spin liquid , but rough estimate can be made , especially given that multi - spin exchanges are less important at high temperatures .    at low temperatures we assume phenomenologically the system forms a spin liquid with fermi sea of spinons ( stabilized by additional interactions ) .",
    "we first analyze this in mean field where it reduces to free fermions hopping on the triangular lattice .",
    "the spin liquid can naturally accommodate nonmagnetic disorder in the spin model by the corresponding changes in the spinon hopping amplitudes .",
    "the full theory also contains a dynamical u(1 ) gauge field , @xcite but this is hard to analyze directly . instead , to go beyond mean field we study wavefunctions obtained by gutzwiller projection of the mean field states .",
    "in one dimension , this can capture the full theory , while in two dimensions this is only an approximation but a reasonable one and dealing directly with physical spins .",
    "overall , we find that the local susceptibility decays rather quickly near an impurity and at small impurity densities such as @xmath12 of cu our results are very far from explaining the experimental data  they would produce very sharp histograms as most of the sites are in the bulk . in the spin liquid phase",
    ", the local susceptibility has an oscillatory @xmath13 component that decays with a power law envelope away from defects , so the impurities can be felt at larger distances , but the overall amplitude that we find is still small .",
    "we then studied the system at high temperature near a boundary and in the presence of a larger density of missing sites .",
    "we also studied the system at low temperature in the mean field near a boundary , in the presence of a larger density of missing sites , and in the presence of random disorder on bonds which is either uniform or localized at a fraction of bonds . from this analysis",
    "it appears that the most likely scenario is the case of relatively large density of point - like disorder , where the linewidths broaden with lowering the temperature until the correlation length becomes comparable to the typical distance between defects .",
    "a puzzling feature is that with such fixed disorder we can not reproduce the observed strong temperature dependence of the nmr lines as the temperatures are lowered further . on the other hand , such models in the metallic phase where we considered electrons with random on - site potentials match reasonably with the experiments under pressure , where the nmr linewidths remain unchanged with temperature.@xcite it could be also that the effective strength of disorder increases as the temperature is lowered in the insulator , perhaps because of the vanishing screening of charged impurities .",
    "better understanding of the disorder in the  system is clearly needed .    a new triangular lattice spin liquid material etme@xmath3sb[pd(dmit)@xmath2]@xmath2 , ref .",
    ", has rather similar phenomenology to that of the  and also appears to have significant nmr line broadening , which may thus be a common feature of gapless spin liquids .",
    "it would be interesting to compare both systems more .",
    "finally we would like to mention that we have performed similar analysis on kagome antiferromagnet addressing the nmr line broadening in the candidate spin liquid material zncu@xmath3(oh)@xmath15cl@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite there , the disorder is relatively well understood experimentally and is estimated to be about @xmath16 vacancies .",
    "our calculations@xcite in this case compare sensibly with the experiment .",
    "in what follows , we calculate local susceptibility in spin models with nonmagnetic disorder .",
    "to set the stage , we summarize the main experimental findings in the form convenient for judging theoretical results .",
    "a direct comparison with the experiments is to look at the width of the local susceptibility histograms relative to the average susceptibility . in the model calculations the bulk susceptibility is roughly the location of the histogram peak , while in the experimental plots we should also be aware of the chemical shifts .",
    "the referencing to the average susceptibility is justified since in the  this remains roughly unchanged around @xmath17  emu / mol in a wide temperature range between 300  k and 30  k and then decreases somewhat to a value around @xmath18  emu / mol at 1  k. also , the bulk values can be quantitatively reproduced by suitable choices of the model parameters such as @xmath19 in the high - temperature series study@xcite or the spinon hopping amplitude in the spin liquid model ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : sl ] ) .",
    "show the nmr lines plotted versus shifts from tetramethylsilane ( tms ) , in parts per million ( ppm ) .",
    "for the more strongly coupled @xmath0c whose hyperfine coupling constant is @xmath20  tesla/(@xmath21  dimer ) , the susceptibility of @xmath17  emu / mol corresponds to @xmath22  ppm knight shift .",
    "thus a 20  ppm shift corresponds to roughly a 10% relative change in the susceptibility at higher temperatures and a somewhat larger relative change at lower temperatures .",
    "reading from the experiments , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the line measured in such relative terms increases from about 10% at 300  k to about 20 - 30% at 50  k to about 50 - 60% at 10  k , and then increases steeply to about 300% at 1  k and saturates around this value at still lower temperatures .",
    "one can appreciate the dramatic broadening directly from the line shapes in refs .  , where the distance of this line from the origin sets a natural scale since the knight shift and the chemical shift are comparable .",
    "( note that to see the inhomogeneous knight shifts over the intrinsic linewidths the experiments are done in large fields of order 8  tesla ; this may be inducing more significant ground state modifications , while in this work we focus on the linear response susceptibilities and their distributions . )",
    "we note that the broadening first sets in gradually coming from high temperatures .",
    "the line is already 20 - 30% broad at @xmath23 , which we can hope to understand quantitatively using reliable high - temperature series approach .",
    "it further broadens by about a factor of two to three in the region 50  k to 5 - 10  k where we expect the spin liquid approach to become applicable .",
    "we now present these two studies .",
    "we consider spin @xmath24 nearest neighbor anti - ferromagnetic heisenberg model on triangular lattice .",
    "local spin susceptibility at site @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "we calculate @xmath28 s in the high temperature series expansions in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities treated as missing sites ( vacancies ) , and also near an open boundary which is a model for a grain boundary .",
    "the expansion is performed to the 12-th order in @xmath19 ( or 13-th order in @xmath29 ) using the linked cluster expansion.@xcite the outline of the procedure is as follows .",
    "we generate all abstract graphs up to desired size .",
    "then we generate all subgraphs of these graphs , keeping track of the location of each subgraph in the graph .",
    "we calculate the local susceptibility for each graph at each point of the graph .",
    "then we subtract all the subgraphs of each graph as needed in the linked cluster expansion to get the contribution this graph would give when embedded into lattice . the local susceptibility on any lattice",
    "can be calculated by creating all possible embeddings of all graphs and adding their contributions at every site . in this general formulation",
    "the lattice does no need to be regular , it can be any connected graph .",
    "in particular this procedure applies to the triangular lattice with a missing site , with a finite density of missing sites , or with a boundary . in practice ,",
    "for the single impurity case , we consider all the graphs containing the impurity and subtract their contribution from the uniform susceptibility .",
    "similar procedure is used in the case with the boundary . in the end , we obtain exact @xmath29 series expansion for the system with such disorder.@xcite    after obtaining the series , we extend it beyond the radius of convergence using the method of pade approximants .",
    "we use [ 5,6 ] , [ 5,7 ] , [ 6,6 ] , [ 6,7 ] and expand in variable @xmath30 where @xmath31 is usually 0.08 as in ref .  .",
    "depending on @xmath31 one might get a pole in the expression , and hence divergence in susceptibility even at relatively large temperature .",
    "this usually happens say in one of the approximants while the others still overlap . at low enough temperatures they start diverging and we take that as a point where the approximation stops being valid .",
    "different values of @xmath31 are tried , and sometimes it is possible to tune to a value where all the curves overlap completely to a much lower temperature , but that is a pathology , probably indicating that the polynomials are all the same . for other values of @xmath31",
    "the curves usually start to diverge from each other at around the same temperature .",
    "the coefficients of the susceptibility of the first five nearest neighbors near the impurity are in table  [ tab_local_susc ] .",
    "the corresponding local susceptibilities along with the uniform susceptibility are plotted in figure  [ fig_local_susc_hight ] .",
    "we see that the local susceptibility decays to the uniform one in few lattice spacings .",
    "this is consistent with calculated very short correlation length in ref .  .",
    "the deviation of the near - neighbor local susceptibility from the uniform value reaches roughly @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "[ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     =    we see that the ratio of the local susceptibility to the uniform one is somewhat larger for the first neighbor here than in the single vacancy case and more importantly the temperature dependence is stronger .",
    "furthermore , the line impurity is an extended object , so a much larger number of sites is affected .",
    "we do not know how common such grain boundaries are in the  material to make predictions for the experiment .",
    "however , as in the case with vacancies , we see that down to @xmath34 only the first few @xmath35 near the boundary deviate significantly from the bulk value .",
    "thus to explain the experimental lines with such defects we would require a large density of them .",
    "the  system does not order down to temperatures as low as @xmath8  mk , but has a @xmath7  k. thus it is a good candidate for spin liquid . among su(2)-invariant spin liquids constructed using fermionic spinons , the uniform spin liquid has the lowest variational energy in the relevant model with ring exchanges.@xcite it consists of spinons hopping on triangular lattice with no fluxes and thus having fermi surface . in the full theory ,",
    "the spinons are coupled to a u(1 ) gauge field .",
    "@xcite this is hard to solve directly . in order to make progress we solve the problem in the mean field theory ignoring the gauge field and obtaining a system of free fermions hopping on the triangular lattice .",
    "we also go beyond mean field by using gutzwiller projection .",
    "specifically , in the mean field , we consider free fermions hopping on the triangular lattice in the presence of a missing site , a line boundary , a finite density of missing sites , and also a random distribution of hopping amplitudes .",
    "these are models of non - magnetic disorder in terms of what the spinons see .    if @xmath36 is the set of single - particle wavefunctions , it is easy to show that the local susceptibility at temperature @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fermi function @xmath40 . in each model of impurities ,",
    "we obtain the wavefunctions and use this formula to obtain the local susceptibility .",
    "we consider various kinds of disorder in turn .",
    "we present the results , a very basic discussion , and leave proper discussion of the possible connection to the  to a later section .",
    "below we keep the spinon hopping @xmath41 fixed and vary the temperature , and the presented susceptibilities are in units of @xmath42 . in a more systematic calculation , the spinon hopping amplitudes would need to be found self - consistently for a given spin hamiltonian and temperature @xmath37 . in the clean system ,",
    "the self - consistent @xmath41 vanishes above some temperature of order @xmath19 ( e.g. , in the renormalized mean field scheme this temperature is @xmath43 ) .",
    "when @xmath41 becomes non - zero , this signals that the system becomes correlated paramagnet , and the spinon mean field is one attempt to capture the growing local correlations . below the onset temperature , the self - consistent @xmath41 quickly approaches the zero - temperature value , and it is this regime that we are describing when keeping @xmath41 fixed . we can estimate the spinon hopping amplitude in the renormalized mean field scheme as @xmath44 .",
    "the free fermion susceptibility on the half - filled triangular lattice with such @xmath45k would be @xmath46  emu / mol , which is about a factor of 2 - 3 larger than the experimental values , but is reasonable given the serious approximations in such calculations .",
    "we further discuss the self - consistent approach in the case with random bond disorder in sec .",
    "[ subsec : randombonds ] . before that in the examples below",
    ", we introduce the disorder into the spinon problem by hand , either by simply removing the links to vacancy sites , or by taking randomly distributed bonds .      in this case",
    "we find the mean field wavefunctions numerically by exact diagonalization for system sizes up to @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting local susceptibility curves for several neighbors of the vacancy are in figure  [ fig_local_susc_freef ] .",
    "=    precise curves for the susceptibility are hard to obtain at low temperatures because of the factor @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_chi_freef ] ) , which becomes increasingly sharp as @xmath49 .",
    "thus fewer and fewer states near the chemical potential contribute and eventually the results are polluted by finite size effects .",
    "nevertheless , we can go to sufficiently low temperatures with our system sizes , and the results in fig .",

    "=    this distribution converges to a zero temperature distribution .",
    "we can obtain some intuition about the long distance behavior from a calculation treating the non - magnetic impurity as a perturbation .",
    "the result is @xmath52 here @xmath53 is the fermi surface location where the group velocity points in the observation direction @xmath54 , while the phase @xmath55 depends on the impurity type and strength ( just as in the case of friedel oscillations in metals ) .",

    "one interesting thing to notice is that there is seemingly much longer wavelength along the @xmath58 direction than @xmath59 .",

    "as an example , for @xmath65 the correlation length is only @xmath66 .",
    "finally , we would like to know if this distribution , with one impurity per 10000 , can roughly give the observed spectral lines in the  material .",
    "the answer is no , and the histograms of @xmath28 are still negligibly narrow .      in the clean system with the boundary we can write all wavefunctions explicitly .",
    "the resulting susceptibilities are shown in figure  [ fig_line_susc_freef ] for the first five neighbors as a function of temperature and in figure  [ fig_line_susc_freef_xdep ] for fixed @xmath67 as a function of the distance from the boundary .",

    "this depends on the size of the grain  in the present model , the distance between boundaries . to show an example",

    "we find that this is indeed the case for the following simple choice : take @xmath84 of bonds to have one value and @xmath16 to have twice as large value ( results not shown ) .",
    "the fact that point - like disorder spreads the peak upon lowering temperature can be understood as follows .",
    "as we lower @xmath37 the correlation length @xmath72 grows and more and more sites start to `` feel '' the impurities and have susceptibility substantially different from the bulk value .",

    "rather quickly below this temperature the spinon hopping becomes large and comparable to the zero - temperature limit .",

    "calculating histogram of susceptibilities for this distribution gives roughly the same result as calculating it for the box distribution of @xmath91 s of the same relative width as that of @xmath88 .",

    "first , our high - temperature series study shows that the local susceptibility near non - magnetic impurities such as vacancies or grain boundaries can deviate sizably from the bulk value .",
    "we studied specifically the heisenberg model with vacancies and obtained quantitatively accurate results down to @xmath34 . even at this low temperature ,",
    "the local susceptibility is modified perceptibly only within few lattice spacings of the defects , cf .  figs .",
    "[ fig_local_susc_hight ] and [ fig_line_susc_hight ] . on the other hand , the @xmath0c",
    "nmr experiments show broadening that develops gradually from high temperatures ; the linewidth roughly doubles going from @xmath129  k down to @xmath130  k , at which the fwhm already corresponds to about 20 - 30% of the bulk susceptibility . in our study",
    ", the few close neighbors of the defects show similar deviation in @xmath106 . however , for a small density of defects , which was our initial assumption , essentially all sites would be sufficiently away from impurities and we would not be able to obtain comparably broad histograms .",
    "we studied vacancies as a model of local nonmagnetic disorder , but we do not expect significant changes for other types of disorder such as random bonds .",
    "the heisenberg model is also not entirely adequate at @xmath68 , where multi - spin exchanges likely affect the ground state , but the role of such terms in a nominally spin model is less important at higher temperatures .",
    "the heisenberg model is thus a reasonable choice at such temperatures and was already used successfully to understand the bulk spin susceptibility.@xcite from the high - temperature study with defects , we are led to ask if there is more disorder in the system than originally thought . to be able to reproduce the @xmath131  k lines , we seem to need the disorder strength comparable to that of few percent vacancy concentration",
    "unfortunately , the way the high - temperature series work , we can not study directly more realistic models of disorder such as random bonds , but our work with vacancies gives a rough idea .",
    "next , we considered the spin liquid with spinon fermi surface as a plausible description of the correlated paramagnet in the temperature range below 50 - 100 k and down to few kelvin .",
    "this is a serious assumption , and even within it we can do quantitative calculations only in the mean field approximation , supplemented by gutzwiller renormalizations .",
    "proceeding nevertheless , in such spin liquid at low temperatures , @xmath132 decays with slow power laws away from defects , cf .",
    "mean field eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chiloc_asymptote])@xcite and ( [ eq : chiloc_boundary_asymptote ] ) , and many sites can be potentially affected by impurities .",
    "however , quantitative aspects appear to be such that we would not get visibly broadened histograms even at @xmath68 unless there is a significant density of impurities .",
    "if we postulate a sizable disorder , we can get @xmath106 histograms comparable to the experimental ones in the temperature range 50 to 10 k. we find that the variation with temperature depends on the type of disorder .",
    "if the disorder is uniformly spread , e.g. , all bonds are random in some range , the peak stops broadening at a relatively high temperature of about half the overall spinon hopping amplitude . on the other hand , for a more point - like disorder , the peak keeps broadening to much lower temperatures .",
    "thus , if the disorder strength is fixed , in order to get significant temperature dependence of the linewidth in the spinon analysis we would need a point - like disorder .",
    "the free fermion mean field applies directly to the metallic side of the phase diagram of the , which appears for pressures above @xmath133  gpa .",
    "the mean field fermions are now the electrons themselves .",
    "what is observed@xcite are essentially temperature - independent @xmath0c nmr lines . as a reasonable type of disorder in this case we took a random distribution of the chemical potentials .",
    "specifically , for a box distribution @xmath134 $ ] , which gives a reasonably large @xmath124 , we find sensible and temperature - independent @xmath106 histograms . on the other hand , making the disorder more point - like , we find that the histograms broaden as we lower the temperature .",
    "thus on the metallic side the nmr lines suggest a uniformly spread disorder .    returning to the mott insulator side",
    ", it appears that there is more disorder here than in the same system on the metallic side .",
    "furthermore , if the disorder is fixed as is reasonable in the metal , the metallic side suggests it is uniform and not producing the broadening of the lines , and so this should also be the case on the mott insulator side , which contradicts the experiments . however , let us assume for a moment that the disorder is point - like .",
    "the peak in fig .",
    "[ fig_triang_ff_susc_n60 ] produced for @xmath16 vacancies broadens by about a factor of two or three in the range @xmath135 to @xmath136 . using @xmath45  k , in the experiment this correspond to the range @xmath130  k to 5  k where we see broadening by about a factor of three which is thus a reasonable agreement .",
    "as mentioned , we do nt expect much broadening below @xmath136 because the correlation length is already about ten lattice spacings which is comparable to the distance between impurities in this example .",
    "however the experiment shows very strong broadening beyond that .",
    "it might be that the origin of the broadening is not disorder and that our spin liquid picture is not adequate and some other phase is emerging at low temperatures , perhaps with incipient magnetic order.@xcite there is a way to explain the observed phenomena within spin liquid picture , but it seems to require that the disorder strength effectively grows as the temperature is lowered .",
    "below we speculate on how this may come about , but more experimental input is needed .",
    "one source of disorder mentioned in the literature for the ( et)-based organic superconductors is ethylene group disorder.@xcite this was particularly discussed for the @xmath1-(et)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br material , where significant sample to sample variations and cooling rate dependence were observed .",
    "however , recent studies@xcite suggest that the amount of such disorder in the @xmath1-(et)@xmath2cu[n(cn)@xmath2]br is small at low temperatures and that perhaps the insulating polymeric layer is involved.@xcite    for the spin liquid material , literature@xcite mentions that one of the ( cn)@xmath11 groups in each unit cell is orientationally disordered and that such structural disorder can generate random electrostatic potential throughout the lattice.@xcite if such disorder is indeed involved , the question is then why it does not have comparable pronounced effects on the metallic side .",
    "one possible explanation is good screening of charged impurities in the metal and progressively weaker and eventually absent screening in the mott insulator .",
    "for example , in the metallic phase , the thomas - fermi screening length is small , @xmath137   , where we estimated the density of states at the fermi level by @xmath138 , @xmath139  mev is the electron hopping amplitude , and @xmath140  @xmath141 is the 3d volume per triangular lattice site . on the insulator side ,",
    "an accurate calculation is harder to make . using semiconductor language",
    ", we can estimate @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the number of thermally excited charge carriers .",
    "the resistivity of the insulator at ambient pressure increases by about four orders of magnitude when the temperature is decreased from room down to 25 k. taking this as an order of magnitude measure of the change in the density of carriers , we get @xmath144   , which is about several lattice spacings .",
    "so one scenario is that the charged disorder is still well screened at room temperature but gradually becomes more visible below 100 to 50 k , with the screening essentially absent below about 10 to 5 k. it might be that this type of disorder is more point like , which further enhances the broadening of the @xmath106 histogram on the insulator side , but is screened on the metallic side where only weak and more uniformly spread disorder remains that does not cause significant histogram broadening at lower temperatures . in appendix  [ app : randomj ] , we briefly discuss how the charged disorder in the electronic system may translate to that in the spin model for the insulator .    at present , we do not know how to estimate the strength of disorder in the system and whether the above scenario is reasonable .",
    "unlike the metallic phase , we can not use the electrical resistivity as a measure of impurity scattering .",
    "we want to remark though that if the disorder is not too strong so that the spin-1/2 model with say random couplings is applicable , our spin liquid construction is still a viable candidate for the ground state . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : randombonds ] , we can accommodate the bond disorder by adjusting spinon hopping amplitudes , which are now non - uniform . from the point of view of spinons",
    ", they are now scattered by this disorder .",
    "interestingly , if the corresponding elastic mean free path is sufficiently small , the thermodynamics of the spinon - gauge system with such diffusive spinons differs from the clean case .",
    "@xcite for example , the specific heat behaves as @xmath145 as opposed to the clean system @xmath146 , while the thermal conductivity behaves as @xmath147 as opposed to @xmath148 .",
