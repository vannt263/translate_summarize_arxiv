    "systems of self - propelled particles ( spp ) , which exhibit an interaction mechanism that favors velocity alignment of neighboring particles , often display collective behaviors like swarming and clustering .",
    "there are many examples for this swarming behavior , ranging from systems of microscopic particles ( sperm , bacteria , nano - rods ) to systems of macroscopic objects ( birds , fish ) .    since the pioneering simulation work of vicsek et al .",
    "@xcite , spp systems have attracted a lot of interest at the theoretical @xcite and computational @xcite level .",
    "typically , in simulation models of swarm behavior , point - like agents move with an imposed non - zero velocity and tend to align their direction of motion with others in a prescribed neighborhood @xcite .",
    "although the alignment mechanism may differ from one model to the other , the basic properties of swarm behavior are quite universal @xcite .",
    "upon variation of parameters such as particle density , particle velocity , or environmental noise , the system can undergo a transition from a disordered state , where the average total velocity or orientation vanishes , to a nematically ordered state . near the transition point , the cluster - size probability density function is characterized by a power - law decay @xcite . for intermediate densities , phase separation into regions of different density and",
    "band formation has been found @xcite .",
    "self - propelled motion is common in biological systems at micro- or mesoscopic length scales , such as suspensions of bacteria , like _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite and _ bacillus subtilis _",
    "@xcite , or tissue cells ( keratocytes ) @xcite , whose sizes are all on the micrometers scale . a special class of biological systems are rod - like self - propelled particles ( rspp ) , for example myxobacteria ( approximately @xmath0 long ) @xcite",
    ". when starved , myxobacteria are elongated to an average aspect ratio of approximately 1:7 , glide on a substrate along their long axis and undergo a process of alignment , rippling , streaming and aggregation that culminates in a three - dimensional fruiting body .",
    "a model , which takes into account the exchange of a morphogen during cell - cell contact and a preferred cell motion in the direction of largest morphogen concentration , has been designed to describe the streaming and two - stage aggregation of myxobacteria @xcite .",
    "sperm ( with a length of about @xmath1 ) @xcite and nematodes @xcite ( about @xmath2 long ) employ a sinusoidal undulation of their slender bodies to push the fluid backwards and to propel themselves forward .",
    "large train - like clusters of wood mouse sperm @xcite are believed to result in greater thrust forces to move more efficiently through a highly viscous environment .",
    "the wood mouse sperm has a hook - like structure at its head , by which it can be hitched to the mid - part or the tail of a neighboring cell for robust cooperation .",
    "however , nematodes which do not have hook structures , also display a pronounced tendency to adhere to each other in a film of water , to form assemblies consisting of many organisms , and to exhibit a striking co - ordinated movement @xcite .",
    "also , sea urchin sperm organize into a hexagonal pattern of rotating vortices at surfaces @xcite .",
    "a nice physical realization of self - propelled rods ( spr ) are bimetallic nano - rods consisting of long pt and au segments @xcite .",
    "the rods , about @xmath3 in diameter and @xmath4 long , move autonomously in an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions by catalyzing the formation of oxygen at the pt end .",
    "they move predominantly in the direction of the pt end , with a velocity depending on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide .",
    "when a gradient of the hydrogen peroxide concentration is imposed , the rods exhibit directed motion towards regions of higher concentrations through active diffusion @xcite .",
    "a related system is a fluidized monolayer of macroscopic rods in the nematic liquid crystalline phase @xcite .",
    "the rods confined between two hard walls are energized by an external vertical vibration , and gain kinetic energy through frequent collisions with the floor and the ceiling of the container .",
    "long - lived giant number fluctuations are found , which shows that simple contact can give rise to flocking , coherent swirling motion and large - scale inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "however , in this experiment , the rods do not have a preferred direction of motion .",
    "all of these examples of self - propelled particles employ different propulsion mechanisms and have different interactions . however , their swarm behavior , such as flocking , streaming and clustering , is surprisingly similar .",
    "the common characteristic of these systems is their rod - like structures and their quasi - two - dimensional active motion .",
    "myxobacteria glide on surfaces @xcite , while sperm and nematodes gather at substrates @xcite . in suspensions of rod - like particles in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "volume exclusion favors the alignment of rods . at high densities ,",
    "it stabilizes a nematic state characterized by long - range orientational order @xcite .",
    "while constant - velocity polar point particles interacting locally by nematic alignment in the presence of noise have been studied intensively in recent years @xcite , much less is known theoretically about the behavior of elongated particles with volume exclusion , or about the collective behavior of swimmers with hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "previous simulation studies of self - propelled rods ( spr ) in two dimensions show that self - propelled motion enhances the tendency for nematic ordering @xcite , as well as aggregation and clustering @xcite .",
    "also , rods have an increased probability to be located near surfaces ( depending on their velocity , length and thermal noise ) @xcite and form hedgehog - like clusters at surfaces @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two regimes of clustering have be distinguished by their unimodal or bimodal weighted cluster - size distribution functions ; however , the system contained a relatively small number of particles compared to those employed in simulation studies of swarming of spps .",
    "continuum equations for the description of spr systems have been derived recently within a mean - field approximation @xcite .",
    "this theory predicts that hard - core interactions are insufficient to generate a macroscopically polarized state , because they can not distinguish the two ends of a rod , and makes interesting predictions for the fluctuations in the nematic and isotropic state ( such as a crossover from diffusive to propagating density fluctuations ) .",
    "however , the mean - field approximation of volume exclusion has the limitation of omitting correlation effects , and thus works best for slowly varying density distributions .",
    "in addition , hydrodynamic interactions between rspp have so far been largely neglected .",
    "these interactions depend on the type of self - propulsion , where  pullers \" repel and  pushers \" attract each other @xcite .",
    "nematic suspensions of swimming rod - like pushers are found to be unstable at long wavelengths as a result of hydrodynamic fluctuations @xcite . for sperm and flagella",
    ", it has been shown theoretically that the hydrodynamic coupling synchronizes the phases of their sinusoidal beating tails @xcite . also , the hydrodynamic interaction between these microswimmers implies attraction and cluster formation @xcite ; similarly , it makes an essential contribution to the capturing of sperm near walls @xcite .",
    "however , the relative importance of directed self - propulsion , particle shape , volume exclusion , and hydrodynamic interactions to the emergence of swarm behavior remains unclear .    in this paper",
    ", we employ a model of hard rods with strict volume exclusions and simulate large systems containing at least 1000 particles .",
    "we focus on rspp systems at a density below the isotropic - nematic transition of brownian rods .",
    "we employ a model consisting of rigid spr performing an overdamped translational motion in two dimensions , and analyze the resulting cluster - size probability density distribution , cluster configurations and lifetimes .",
    "three types of cluster - size probability density distribution functions allow to distinguish three different states , and to construct a phase diagram as a function of particle density and environmental noise . as a special case of rspp with an explicit propulsion mechanism ,",
    "we investigate a suspension of flagella , which move by sinusoidal beating of their body in a two - dimensional fluid .",
    "the motion of the surrounding fluid is described by particle - based mesoscopic simulation method called multi - particle collision dynamics ( mpc ) @xcite .",
    "this method has been shown to capture the full hydrodynamics and flow behavior of complex fluids over a wide range of reynolds numbers very well @xcite . by comparing the results for spr and flagella , we elucidate the contribution of hydrodynamic interactions to the swarm behavior .",
