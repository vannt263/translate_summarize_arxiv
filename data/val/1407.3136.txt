    "astrophysical jets as highly collimated beams of high velocity material and outflows of less degree of collimation and lower speed are an ubiquitous phenomenon in a variety of astrophysical sources .",
    "the role of magnetic fields in the realm of jets and accretion disks can not be underestimated .",
    "it is crucial for the launching , acceleration , and collimation of jets ( see , e.g. ) .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the physical problem , the exact time evolution and geometry of these processes is still under debate .",
    "jets and outflows from young stellar objects ( yso ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) clearly affect their environment , and , thus , at the same time the formation process of the objects that are launching them ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , in order to quantify the feedback phenomenon - namely to specify how much mass , angular momentum , and energy is being ejected into the surrounding via the outflow channel - it is essential to model the physics in the innermost launching area of the disk - jet system with a high resolution .",
    "it is commonly accepted that ejection and accretion are tightly connected to each other .",
    "the study of these phenomena is motivated also by the observed correlation between accretion and ejection signatures @xcite .",
    "our paper deals exactly with these topics - we will provide a relation between actual magnetization within the disk , and the ejection to accretion ratio for mass and energy .",
    "the first numerical simulations of this kind were presented by @xcite , who demonstrated how an outflow can be self - consistently launched out of the accretion disk , acclerated to high velocity and collimated in a narrow beam . later studied in particular the impact of a central stellar wind on the accretion disk magnetic field inclination .",
    "the work by revealed the great importance of the underlying disk diffusivity , namely the strength of diffusivity and its directional anisotropy .",
    "studying two limits of rather high and low diffusivity , and keeping the same ( about equipartition ) magnetic field strength and field structure , the authors found that a steady state of the simulation could not be reached for an arbitrary combination of these parameters .",
    "@xcite in particular found that the efficiency of the launching mechanism is strongly dependent on the disk magnetization .",
    "a common assumption was that in order to launch jets , the magnetic field should be rather strong , somewhat about the equipartition value .",
    "this question was investigated in detail by , demonstrating that even with a weak magnetization of @xmath0 jets could be driven .",
    "so far , the general mechanism of jet launching from magnetized disks have been studied by a number of authors . however , due to the complexity of the problem , the combined action of the various processes engaged could not be easily disentangled .",
    "another problem arises if only a short - term evolution of the system is considered , as this will be strongly dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "what is somewhat complicating the interpretation of simulations in the literature is that usually the model setup is categorized by the _ initial _",
    "parameters , and not by the _",
    "actual _ quantities such as the actual disk magnetization , accretion velocity etc . at a certain evolutionary time .",
    "the latter was first discussed by @xcite , however , the parameter space applied in those simulations was rather limited . in the present study",
    "we will show that it is the actual disk properties , in particular the disk magnetization , that govern the accretion and ejection .",
    "accretion disks are considered to be highly turbulent for any degree of the disk magnetization .",
    "the source of the turbulence is still debated , however , a great variety of unstable modes in magnetized accretion disks exists @xcite . in case of moderately magnetized disks ,",
    "the main candidate is the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "highly magnetized disks are subject to the parker instability and the trans - slow alfvn continuum modes @xcite .",
    "the puzzling question is what is the effective diffusivity and viscosity the disk turbulence provides , and how can these effects be properly implemented under the mean field approach .",
    "as shown by @xcite and later adapted by , the turbulent energy and angular momentum flux is dominated by the magnetic stress rather than the reynolds stress .",
    "thus , in the presence of a moderately strong magnetic field the reynolds stress becomes less important . in order to disentangle the complex behaviour and keep the simulations more simple ,",
    "we explore only non - viscous disks .    considering the accretion - ejection scenario ,",
    "we are convinced that before any general relation between physical quantities can be claimed , it is essential that the system itself has dynamically evolved over a sufficiently extended period of time .",
    "we have therefore evolved our simulations for at least 10.000 dynamical times .",
    "we will show that such a long simulation requires that the advective and diffusive processes have to be well in balance .    in our paper",
    "we apply the following approach .",
    "first , we consider the standard diffusivity model ( see e.g. ) . after having obtained a near equilibrium solution with advection and diffusion in balance",
    ", we closely examine the state of the system .",
    "essentially , we will argue that it is the balance between diffusion and advection that governs the strength of the _ actual _ disk magnetization .",
    "the latter appears to be the key ingredient for the evolution of the whole system .",
    "exploring a wide range of the actual disk magnetization allows us to derive a general correlation between the actual disk magnetization and major quantities of the disk - jet system , such as the mass and energy ejection efficiencies .",
    "we also present a model setup which is well suited for a long - term evolution study of the jet launching problem .",
    "the use of spherical geometry provides a high resolution in the inner region of the disk - the site of jet launching , and a low resolution for the outer regions , where the physical processes typically evolve on much longer time scales .",
    "our paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the numerical setup , the initial and boundary conditions of our simulations . in section 3 we discuss our reference simulation , that is characterized by the balance between advection and diffusion , and uses the standard diffusivity model . in section 4",
    "we present a detailed analysis of jet launching disks , revealing the major role of the disk magnetization in the disk - jet evolution . in section 5",
    "we discuss simulations applying a new diffusivity model that essentially overcomes the accretion instability observed in the previous simulations .",
    "this allows us to follow substantially longer the evolution of the disk - jet system .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section 6",
    "we apply the mhd code pluto @xcite , version 4.0 , solving the time - dependent , resistive mhd equations on a spherical grid @xmath1 .",
    "we refer to @xmath2 as cylindrical coordinates .",

    "the electric current density is denoted by @xmath16 . as shown by @xcite , cooling may indeed play a role for jet launching , influencing both jet density and velocity . for the sake of simplicity we set the cooling term equal to ohmic heating , @xmath17 .",
    "thus all generated heat is instantly radiated away .",
    "the magnetic field evolution is governed by the induction equation @xmath18    our simulations are performed in 2d axisymmetry applying spherical coordinates .",
    "we use the harten - lax - van leer ( hll ) riemann solver together with a third - order order runge - kutta scheme for time evolution and the ppm ( piecewise parabolic method ) reconstruction of @xcite for spatial integration .",
    "the magnetic field evolution follows the method of constrained transport @xcite .",
    "no physical scales are introduced in the equations above .",
    "the results of our simulations will be presented in non - dimensional units .",
    "we normalize all variables , namely @xmath19 , to their values at the inner disk radius @xmath20 .",
    "lengths are given in units of @xmath21 , corresponding to inner disk radius .",

    "accretion requires corresponding torques to be sustained and since there is no initial poloidal current defined , @xmath72 = 0 ( that takes time to build up from a weak poloidal field ) , a non - zero initial velocity will only lead to extra oscillations .",

    "accretion disks are considered to be highly turbulent , subject to the magneto - rotational instability ( mri ) in moderately magnetized disks @xcite , and the parker instability for stronger magnetized disks .",

    "a strong magnetic field may become buoyant , leading to the parker instability . while the mri is confined within the disk , the parker instability operates closer to the surface of the disk where the toroidal magnetic field is stronger .    in order to extrapolate the results from a self - consistent",
    ", local treatment of turbulence to the mean field approach is not straightforward . in the local treatment",
    "the extraction of angular momentum is due to both turbulence - operating on small scales - and torques by the mean magnetic field on large scales .",
    "thus , removal of angular momentum goes hand in hand with destroying of the turbulent magnetic field or the effective magnetic diffusivity . in case of the mean field approach",
    ", there is no small scale turbulence and , thus , no angular momentum removal by local turbulent motions .",
    "here , the diffusivity plays only a role for leveling out the magnetic field gradient , thus setting the overall structure of the magnetic field .",

    "the relation between the mean magnetic field and the effective torques , and the diffusivity and viscosity that turbulence provides .",
    "we believe that when moving from a local turbulence approach to the mean field approach , the relevance of the model should be approved by the relevance of the magnetic field distribution itself , and not by the diffusivity model .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that the magnetic field strength and structure of real accretion disks are also not known .",
    "therefore , when considering any simulation results , always the diffusivity model applied should be taken into account .",
    "a self - consistent study of the origin of the turbulence is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "we therefore prescribe a certain model of the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "we apply an @xmath115-prescription ( @xcite ) for the magnetic diffusivity , implicitly assuming that the diffusivity has a turbulent origin .",
    "the diffusivity profile may extend up to one disk height above the disk surface ( figure  [ fig : main_profiles ] ) .",

    "numerical models with zero net magnetic field usually provide low numerical values @xmath121 , reaching at most @xmath122 @xcite . on the other hand , numerical modelling of the mri applying",
    "a non - zero net magnetic field @xcite indicate substantially higher values , @xmath123 , with a corresponding magnetization @xmath124 .",
    "obviously , different functions of @xmath125 will lead to different evolution .",
    "we start from the well - known model for magnetic diffusivity applied by many authors before , @xmath126 by applying @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the alfvn speed , and @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 are the magnetization , the adiabatic sound speed and the local disk height , respectively , measured at the disk midplane .",
    "we evolve @xmath119 and @xmath130 in time , but for the sake of simplicity we keep @xmath131 and @xmath118 constant in time , thus equal to the initial distribution .",
    "the main reason is to avoid additional feedback , which favors the accretion instability ( see below , or e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "our test simulations evolving the disk height in time , in fact indicate the rise of such instability earlier than in case of a fixed - in - time disk diffusivity aspect ratio .      in general , the diffusivity tensor has diagonal non - zero components , @xmath132 where we denote @xmath133 as the _ poloidal _ magnetic diffusivity , and @xmath134 as the _ toroidal _ magnetic diffusivity , respectively .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath135 quantifies the different strength of diffusivity in poloidal and toroidal directions .    in the literature",
    "it is common to assume @xmath136 of order the of unity . considering viscous disks ,",
    "showed that there is a theoretical limit for @xmath134 , namely @xmath137 .",
    "highly resolved disk simulations indeed suggest @xmath138 , implying that the toroidal field component is typically diffusing faster than the poloidal component .",
    "the majority of simulations in the literature consider a magnetic field strength in equipartition with the gas pressure .",
    "however , studying also weakly magnetized disks , we find that there also exists an upper limit for the anisotropy parameter , above which the simulations show an irregular behaviour .",
    "on the other hand , it was pointed out by several authors ( see e.g. ) that in case of a very low anisotropy parameter ( thus , a weak toroidal diffusivity ) the simulations might suffer from instabilities caused by strong pinching forces .",
    "nonetheless , the existence of an upper limit for the anisotropy parameter was so far obscured by other processes .    assuming a steady state and combining the poloidal component of the diffusion equation , @xmath139 , with the relation for the mach number @xmath140 ( see below , @xcite ) , an interrelation between the toroidal and poloidal electric currents can be derived , @xmath141 this relation has been proven to approximately hold for all of our simulations , thus indicating that a steady state has indeed been reached .",
    "since the only free parameter in this relation is @xmath142 , the choice of @xmath142 governs the ratio of the electric current components .    as shown previously the toroidal component of the induction equation",
    "can be written as @xmath143 ( here expressed for spherical coordinates ) , where @xmath144 is computed at the disk midplane .",
    "this equation essentially states that the induction of the toroidal magnetic field component ( from twisting the poloidal component ) is being balanced by the diffusion through the disk midplane and by escape of the flux through the disk surface .",
    "we emphasize that we do _ not _ neglect the @xmath145 term , considering the assumption of a thin disk @xcite , as we find it of key importance in our simulations , in particular in the regime of a moderately strong magnetic field , @xmath146 .",
    "assuming that the induction of the magnetic field is primarily due to radial gradients , the radial component of the magnetic field can be approximated by a power law , @xmath147 , and equation [ eq : etjr ] may be transformed into @xmath148 , or @xmath149 where @xmath150 is denoted as the ejection mach number , where @xmath151 is measured at the disk surface .",
    "using relation [ eq : jrjphi ] between the poloidal and toroidal electric currents and defining the curvature part of the toroidal current @xmath152 , one may derive a constraint for the anisotropy parameter , @xmath153    any magnetic field geometry which is outwardly bent and has a decreasing field strength in outward direction has to satisfy this relation , as @xmath154 consists of two positive terms , the gradient and the curvature . in cases",
    "where the vertical velocity term can be neglected ( e.g. for a very weak magnetic field with @xmath155 ) , the anisotropy parameter is @xmath156 , which for our choice of @xmath142 is about 0.4 . by probing the @xmath136 parameter space we found that in order to obtain a stable accretion - outflow configuration for weakly magnetized disks",
    ", the @xmath136 should be in the range @xmath157 .",
    "we therefore decided to apply @xmath158 for all of our simulations .",
    "we note that in simulations applying an anisotropy parameter @xmath159 , we faced the problem that the poloidal magnetic field lines were  moving  rapidly , such that the bending of the field lines along the disk midplane was actually inverted .",
    "this is a result of the combined effects of a strong outward diffusion and low torques at the midplane . on the other hand , in case of a rather low anisotropy parameter , the accretion is rapid and the jet does establish a steady behaviour .",
    "the reason why the commonly chosen anisotropy @xmath160 leads to a steady behaviour is rather simple .",
    "as the disk magnetization grows during advection , the ejection mach number grows as well ( we find that @xmath161 saturating at a level of 0.8 , see below ) .",
    "thus in case of a high disk magnetization - usually assumed in the literature - the above mentioned upper limit for the anisotropy parameter is satisfied . in case of weak magnetic field simulations , performed e.g. by ,",
    "this limit is most likely satisfied by additional viscous torques .      in the introduction section",
    "we have already discussed the literature of accretion - ejection simulations . here",
    "we want to explicitly emphasize specific details in which our simulations differ from previous works .    *",
    "a spherical grid has been applied , offering the opportunity of a much larger domain size as well as much higher resolution _ in the inner part _ of the disk .",
    "a new set of boundary conditions is used that is adapted to the spherical grid .",
    "* we were able to explore a continuous range of simulation parameters .",
    "in particular we were aiming to disentangle interrelations between the _ actual _ flow parameters , rather than an interrelation to the initial values . * altogether , our model setup allows very long term simulations on a large grid - so far we have run simulations for approximately @xmath162 time units for a standard diffusivity model , and more than @xmath163 time units for our modified strong diffusivity model .",
    "* we allow the inflow ( into the coronal region ) density to vary in time , thus keeping the ratio between the inflow and the disk densities @xmath164 the same as initially .",
    "we have explored a vast range of the parameter space that covers the majority of simulations performed in the literature ( see table  [ tbl : compar ] ) .",
    "similar to all these papers we assume a thin disk @xmath55 .",

    "second , with our long - term evolution simulations we were able to investigate the interrelation between the _ actual _ disk properties such magnetization , the ejection to accretion ratios of mass and energy , jet velocity , and others .",
    "this has not been done in the past , as most papers have compared the _ initial _ parameters of the simulations .",
    "as shown by @xcite both the magnetization and diffusivity may substantially change during the disk evolution , and the parameters for the initial setup @xmath171 or @xmath119 are not sufficient to characterize the disk - jet system .    in order to uniquely specify the _",
    "initial conditions _ for the simulation , we prescribe a number of non - dimensional characteristic parameters . the _ initial _",

    "the _ initial _ strength and structure of the magnetic field is set by @xmath171 and @xmath63 , respectively . in all simulations",
    "we have chosen @xmath172 .",
    "the initial disk magnetization does not play a major role in the _ jet launching _ process , but it is responsible for the overall disk torques .",
    "the main reason is that the magnetization in the inner disk , from which the main jet is being launched , changes very quickly .",

    "after some 1000 revolutions , the inner parts of the disk - outflow reaches a quasi steady state .",
    "however , it takes much longer time for the outer parts to reach such a state .",
    "the outflow , initiated already at early times and constantly accelerated , finally reaches super - fast magnetosonic speed .",

    "can be re - established very well by our approach . using a spherical setup ,",
    "the resolution in the inner part of the disk is higher than in the literature , and the simulations run substantially longer than any other simulation published before .",
    "our simulations behave very robust .",
    "we believe that there are two main reasons for that .",
    "first , the spherical geometry does well resolve the inner part of the disk , from which the dominant part of the jet is launched , but smooths out the small scale perturbations in the outer disk . by that , perturbations arising throughout the disk are diminished .",
    "second , our choice for the diffusivity parameter @xmath142 allows to evolve the simulations into a quasi steady state in which advection is balanced by diffusion .",
    "however , even with such an optimized numerical setup ( the reference setup ) our simulations show some irregular behaviour typically at about 30,000 time units .",
    "the reason is that since the current diffusivity model is prone to the accretion instability ( see @xcite , and section below ) , the simulations are always in a state of marginal stability . as a consequence ,",
    "the simulations evolve into a state of either high or low magnetization . in case of high magnetization the structure of the inner disk",
    "is being drastically changed and current model of diffusivity can not be applied . in the opposite case of weak magnetization stable jets can not be sustained .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss different components of the disk - jet system and the jet launching and acceleration mechanism .",
    "we define how we measure certain disk properties , such as the location of the disk surface or the mass fluxes in the physically different areas .",
    "we explore the role of the diffusivity , the strength and geometry of the magnetic field in respect to the outflow and accretion rates .",
    "we define the disk surface as a surface where the _ radial velocity changes sign_. in a steady state the area where the radial velocity and the magnetic torque changes sign is almost identical .",
    "figure [ fig : def_struct ] shows the typical structure of the disk - jet system .",
    "several , physically different regions can be distinguished - the inflow area , the jet acceleration area , the launching area , and the accretion domain .",
    "these are separated by colored lines .",
    "white and black lines mark the disk surface that separates disk and corona regions .",
    "two other lines separate the accretion , launching and acceleration areas .",
    "we define the _ accretion region _ as the area where velocity is mainly radial , @xmath181 , and the _ acceleration region _ as the area where the flow velocity is parallel to the magnetic field , @xmath182 . as the _ launching area _",
    "we characterize the region in between .    in our simulations ,",
    "the position of the disk surface as defined above remains about constant in time .",
    "this confirms our choice of the control volume ( see below ) and our choice to fix the diffusive scale height during the simulation .    according to our boundary conditions we prescribe a weak inflow into the region between the inner disk radius and the rotational axis .",
    "this inflow provides the matter content as well as the pressure balance along the rotational axis .",
    "the astrophysical motivation can be the presence of a central stellar magnetic field or a stellar wind . in figure",
    "[ fig : def_struct ] the inflow area is the area between the rotational axis and the red line that marks the magnetic field line rooted in the inner disk radius at the midplane . in all figures below the magnetic field line closest to",
    "the axis always corresponds to the magnetic field line anchored at the inner disk radius .",
    "here we briefly comment on the jet launching mechanism in our reference simulation that is - as in previous simulations - the blandford - payne magneto - centrifugal driving .            as demonstrated above ( see figure  [ fig : def_struct ] ) , the magnetic torque @xmath183 changes sign on the disk surface .",
    "it is negative in the disk and positive in the corona .",
    "thus , the magnetic field configuration established extracts angular momentum from the disk .",
    "the angular momentum extraction relies on the induced toroidal magnetic field component which plays a key role in transferring the angular momentum @xmath184 .",
    "gaining angular momentum , the material that is loaded to the field lines from the accretion disk is pushed outwards by the centrifugal force .    in order to illustrate the acceleration process",
    ", we show the magnitude of lorentz force with respect to the thermal pressure and centrifugal forces .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_forces ] shows the contours where the perpendicular and parallel components of the lorentz force are equal to the perpendicular and parallel components of pressure and centrifugal force , respectively . in the accretion disk both the pressure and the centrifugal forces dominate the poloidal component of the lorentz force . below the disk surface",
    "the lorentz force ( toroidal component ) extracts the angular momentum from the disk .",
    "since the lorentz force increases along the outflow , it is worth to check the decomposed lorentz force components @xmath185 in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "the ratio between toroidal and parallel components of the magnetic field , @xmath186 is shown in figure  [ fig : def_btbp ] .",
    "we see that the centrifugal force is stronger in the inner area of the disk rather than in the outer parts of the disk . at the sonic surface ,",
    "the lorentz force overcomes the pressure forces . from this point on the main acceleration force is the centrifugal force .",
    "further along the outflow - between the alfvn surface and the fast surface - the lorentz force becomes the main accelerating force .",
    "we now explore the mass flux evolution namely the accretion and ejection rates .    in @xmath32-direction",
    "the control volume is enclosed by the disk surface ( as defined above ) @xmath187 and the disk midplane .",
    "the two other surfaces which enclose the control volume are marked by @xmath188 and @xmath189 , and correspond to the vertical arcs at the innermost disk radius ( @xmath190 ) and at any other radius @xmath43 .",
    "the control volume defined by these surfaces is denoted by @xmath191 .",
    "thus , the disk mass enclosed by a radius @xmath43 follows from @xmath192 while the mass accretion rate at a certain radius @xmath43 is @xmath193 and the mass ejection rate is integrated along the disk surface , @xmath194    the mass accretion rate is defined positive if it increases the mass in the control volume .",
    "the mass ejection rate is defined positive if it decreases the mass of the control volume .",
    "the factor of two in front of the integrals takes into account the fact that only one hemisphere is treated .",
    "note also a minus sign in front of the integrals .",
    "it is common to introduce the ejection index @xmath195 which is based on the mass conservation law for a steady solution .",
    "it basically measures the steepness of the radial profile of the accretion rate along the midplane . setting the outer radius to @xmath196 and the inner radius to unity , the ejection index interrelates ejection and accretion ,",
    "@xmath197    we obtain the ejection index by a linear approximation of @xmath198 within @xmath199 $ ] the higher the ejection index , the higher the fraction of accreted matter being ejected within a given radius , and the less matter reaches the inner boundary . for our reference simulation @xmath200 at @xmath201 .",
    "although the disk continuously loses mass ( figure  [ fig : def_massflux ] ) , after dynamical times 1000 - 2000 the disk mass loss is much smaller that the corresponding ejection and accretion rates .",
    "we therefore state that the simulation evolves through a series of quasi steady states .",
    "we find that a continuous disk mass loss is a typical feature of a simulation like our reference simulation .",
    "this is because the mass accretion from outside some outer disk radius is not able to sustain the mass which is lost by accretion and ejection within this radius .",
    "we also find that the standard diffusivity model typically leads to a _ magnetic field _",
    "distribution in the disk that is almost constant in time ( not in space ) .",
    "these two facts result in an increase of the disk magnetization in the inner disk , that in turn leads to a more rapid accretion in the inner disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_massflux ] shows the time evolution of the mass accretion and ejection rates .",
    "note also the general decrease of the mass fluxes over time , which is a direct consequence of the decrease of the disk mass .",
    "the behaviour and actual values of the mass fluxes are typical to the literature values .",
    "one should notice two distinct features of the mass fluxes .",
    "first , the higher integration volume , the higher the mass ejection rate .",
    "second , in jet launching disks the mass accretion rate must increase with the radius . these plots also indicate that the evolution of the system can be seen as a consecutive evolution through a series of quasi steady states .      here",
    "we discuss simulations , investigating the influence of the initial magnetic field bending parameter @xmath63 .",
    "we have varied @xmath63 from 0.2 ( strongly inclined ) to 0.9 ( almost vertical ) .",
    "our main result is that , although the simulations evolve slightly different initially , on the long - term evolution they are almost indistinguishable .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_m ] shows the time evolution of the ejection to accretion mass flux ratio .",
    "the fluxes are again computed for the control volume extending to @xmath202 .",
    "it seems to take a few 1000 dynamical time steps for the simulation to lose the memory of the initial magnetic field configuration , but at @xmath203 convergence has been obviously reached .",
    "this is also true for the fluxes of angular momentum and energy , and holds as well for the corresponding flux ratios .",
    "the reason why the simulations convergence into a single - specific - configuration is the fact that it is mainly the diffusivity model that governs the evolution of the magnetic field evolution . when we start the simulations with the same initial magnetic field strength at the midplane , this results in exactly the same magnetic diffusivity profile .",
    "since we explore rather weak magnetic fields ( weaker than the equipartition field ) , the underlying disk structure can not be changed substantially by the lorentz force . in contrary",
    ", the magnetic field distribution adjusts itself in accordance with the diffusivity model , which has the same vertical profile ab initio .",
    "the convergence we observe for these simulations , starting from an initial magnetic field with different bending , again confirms the reliability of our model in general .",
    ".,width=302 ]      here , we briefly present example results of the resolution study .",
    "we have performed simulations with a grid resolution of ( 0.5 , 0.75 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0)-times our standard resolution of 128 cells per quadrant , corresponding to ( 64 , 96 , 128 , 192 , 256 ) cells per quadrant , or approximately ( 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 ) cells per disk height @xmath57 .",
    "note that once the resolution in @xmath32-direction and the radial extent of the disk is chosen , the resolution in @xmath43-direction is uniquely determined ( see section  [ sec : numgrid ] ) .    for the resolution study all simulations were performed up to typically 10,000 time units .",
    "figure  [ fig : res_all ] shows snapshots of some of these simulations . essentially , we see an almost identical disk - outflow structure , indicating that numerical convergence has indeed been reached .",
    "figure  [ fig : res_tmx ] shows the time evolution of the mass ejection to accretion ratio , again integrated throughout the control volume @xmath204 , for simulations of a different resolution .",
    "we notice two particular issues .",
    "first , all curves bunch together at the mass ejection - to - accretion ratio of about @xmath205 , indicating convergence of the simulations ( this is also true for other flux ratios ) .",
    "second , the simulation with the highest resolution show some intermittent behaviour ( see figure  [ fig : res_all ] ) .",
    "this might be related to the spatial reconstruction in non - cartesian coordinates close to the symmetry axis or to the ability to resolve more detailed structures .",
    "we conclude that for the resolution chosen our simulations have converged for the launching region .",
    "note that although the spherical grid is beneficial for disk and outflow launching studies , mainly due to the higher resolution of the inner disk , its application to the jet propagation further away from the jet source is limited because of the lack of resolution at larger radii .",
    "in the following we investigate a number of physical processes of jet launching by comparing different simulations similar to the reference simulation .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the evolution of our reference simulation can be seen as a sequence of quasi - steady states .",
    "the slow , but constant decrease of the disk mass eventually leads to the change of the disk magnetization .",
    "this is more prominent in the inner part of the disk , whereas the magnetization of the outer disk does not change too much .",
    "this feature brings the opportunity of studying the disk and jet quantities with respect to the _ actual _ disk magnetization .    in this section",
    "we present a set of simulations similar to our reference simulation , however applying a slightly different choice of parameters .",
    "the reference simulation was chosen such that diffusive processes are in balance with advective processes .",
    "now , by choosing a slightly different diffusivity parameter @xmath142 , these processes now are out of the balance .",
    "this leads either to further faster advection or diffusion of the magnetic field . naturally , in case of lower @xmath142 , advection dominates , and , thus , magnetization grows , leading to even faster advection . in the opposite case ,",
    "the disk magnetization decreases .",
    "this approach allows us to study the evolution of the accretion - ejection in a very general way .",
    "each of the simulations applied has started from the same initial conditions , however , it now follows a different evolutionary track and finally evolves into a quite different state of the system .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_xevol ] shows the time evolution of the disk mass , the average magnetization of the inner disk ( averaged between @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) , and the jet speed here defined as    @xmath208    the maximum jet speed obtained at @xmath209 , considering only those magnetic field lines rooted in the disk .",
    "we emphasize that the jet speed as computed here is only an extrapolation of the terminal jet speed ( at infinity ) .",
    "the general behaviour of the disk is as follows .",
    "first , the different simulations behave rather similar . after some time",
    "they start to differ from each other . at",
    "later stages the disks and their outflows arrive at definitely different dynamical states .",
    "the exact times at which this happens , depends of course on the radius for which we examine of the disk properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_xevol ] shows this evolution in the disk and jet quantities for the inner disk .",
    "therefore the time when simulations start showing differences is rather small , about few hundred dynamical time steps .    since we start the simulation with _ no _ accretion , initially diffusion is not in balance .",
    "however , electric currents are induced quickly within the disk , and subsequent angular momentum transport results in accretion .",
    "depending on the value of diffusivity parameter @xmath142 the system results either in advection - dominated regime ( for @xmath210 ) , or diffusion dominated regime ( @xmath211 ) . in principle",
    "an equilibrium situation is possible in which these two processes are in balance . in case of @xmath212 ,",
    "the diffusivity parameter for an equilibrium situation is around @xmath175 .",
    "we will refer to the _ critial _ diffusivity parameter @xmath213 as the one corresponding to the equilibrium state when advection and diffusion balance each other .",
    "generally , the lower the diffusivity , the stronger the advection and thus the resulting magnetization .",
    "we confirm @xcite finding that in case of a strong magnetic field with @xmath214 the disk structure changes substantially - the disk becomes much thinner in the inner region of the disk .",
    "a stronger magnetic field exerts a stronger torque on the disk , leading to a faster accretion rate .",
    "thus , at some point in time the accretion velocity becomes supersonic , @xmath215 .",
    "we consider this as the limit for applying our magnetic diffusivity model .    as clearly visible from the figures discussed above , for the present setup",
    "the current diffusivity model ( equation  [ eq : stdiff ] ) is only marginally stable - all deviations from the critical diffusivity will be further amplified .",
    "if magnetic diffusion dominates the disk , the magnetic field becomes weaker and weaker unless at about @xmath216 the jet outflow can not be sustained anymore . on the other hand , a weaker diffusivity leads to a faster accretion that also results in a runaway process .",
    "one way to circumvent this problem is to apply a different model for the diffusivity , namely @xmath125 ( see section  [ sec : strong ] ) .",
    "as might be easily seen from figure  [ fig : def_xevol ] , ongoing disk mass depletion in most cases leads to a higher degree of disk magnetization , a process which happens faster for less diffusive , thus higher advective simulations .",
    "a change in magnetization may substantially changes the dynamics of the disk .",
    "the stronger magnetization , for example , leads to higher jet speed .",
    "one might notice the deviation in the behaviour of the jet terminal speed for the low value of @xmath142 .",
    "we believe that this results from the position where we calculate the terminal speed - for this case the jet accelerates even further out and the asymptotic velocity is not reached at @xmath217 for low @xmath142 ( or highly magnetized ) case and is still in a process of transforming the magnetic energy into kinetic . in a follow - up paper we will discuss the terminal jet speed much more detail , demonstrating that already for a moderately weak magnetic field , @xmath218 , the terminal jet speed reaches unity .    in summary , we state that it is the _ actual magnetization _ in the disk that governs ejection and accretion and that is directly linked to various disk - jet quantities .      here",
    "we present the analysis of the angular momentum and energy transport in our simulations .",
    "it is common to explore the angular momentum and energy transport by means of their fluxes through a control volume .",
    "we define the accretion angular momentum flux @xmath219 as the sum of kinetic and magnetic parts , keeping the same control volume as for the mass fluxes ( see appendix [ app : fluxes ] ) .",
    "( from down to up),width=302 ]        figure  [ fig : comp_jjet ] shows the time evolution of the jet angular momentum flux for a number of simulations .",
    "we divide them in in three different groups distinguished by their _ initial _ magnetization , @xmath220 .",
    "different lines within each group represent simulations with different diffusivity parameter @xmath142 .",
    "the jet angular momentum flux is calculated through the upper part of the control volume , thus up to r = 10 .",
    "as expected , the stronger the overall magnetic field strength is in the disk , the stronger torque it exerts , and thus the higher angular momentum fluxes we find .",
    "although the magnetic diffusivity parameter @xmath142 differs within each group of lines ( marked by different colors ) , the total torque measured for the corresponding simulations is about the same .",
    "this comes from the fact that the total torque is set by the global magnetic field .",
    "thus , the evolution of the total torque is mainly set by the initial conditions .",
    "we note that the simulations applying a strong initial magnetic field ( represented by the upper bundle of curves in figure  [ fig : comp_jjet ] ) have been interrupted earlier compared to usual evolution times . for these cases",
    "the inner part of the disk became highly magnetized .",
    "the strong magnetic field changes the inner disk structure such that our model for the magnetic diffusivity can not be applied anymore .",
    "this is simply because the actual scale height of the disk significantly decreases and does no longer coincide with the initial disk surface .",
    "the case of strong magnetic fields we consider as being beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the underlying turbulence might be significantly suppressed as well .    in accordance with previous works ( see e.g. ) we find that the ratio of angular momentum extracted by the jet to that provided by the disk accretion is always close to , but slightly larger than unity , @xmath221 @xmath2221 .",
    "the main reason is that the accretion rate in the outer part of the disk is too low to compete with a strong mass loss by the disk wind at these radii .",
    "we define the accretion energy flux ( accretion power ) as the sum of the mechanical ( kinetic and gravitational ) , magnetic , and thermal energy fluxes , @xmath223 and , similarly , the jet energy flux ( jet power ) by @xmath224 in contrast to the angular momentum flux , most of the energy flux is being released from the inner part of the disk .",
    "this makes the energy flux very sensitive to the conditions in the inner disk .",
    "indeed , figure  [ fig : def_b_ejet ] shows that the power liberated by the jet strongly depends on the diffusivity parameter , which is the main agent for governing the magnetic field strength .",
    "a weaker diffusivity parameter @xmath142 leads to a higher magnetization , and , thus a higher jet power .",
    "the same is true for the accretion power .",
    "we further find that the ratio of energy fluxes , namely the ratio of the jet to accretion energy flux , is always close , but slightly lower than unity .",
    "this is also in accordance with .    in this section",
    "we have provided some evidence that it is the _ actual _ magnetization in the disk which governs the fluxes of mass , energy and angular momentum . in the next section",
    "we show how exactly these fluxes are connected to magnetization .      in a steady state , diffusion and advection balance .",
    "advection of the magnetic flux in principle increases the magnetic field strength , predominantly in the inner disk . in contrary",
    ", the diffusion smooths out the magnetic field gradient .",
    "therefore , the diffusivity model applied is a key ingredient for these processes , directly influencing the disk structure and evolution .    in the following analysis",
    "we will not focus on the profile or the magnitude of the magnetic diffusivity , but concentrate on the resulting magnetization and its time evolution . as discussed above , by changing the magnetic diffusivity parameter @xmath142 we are able to explore how the actual disk magnetization influences various properties of the disk - jet system .    for each parameter run performed , we measure the _ actual _ physical variables in the disk - jet system , such as the _ time - dependent _ mean magnetization , accretion fluxes , jet fluxes , or the accretion mach number .",
    "naturally , the _ actual _ value of a certain property has evolved from the initial value during the simulation . with mean value",
    "we denote the values averaged over a small area of the inner disk , @xmath225 all mean quantities discussed are averaged over the inner disk midplane from @xmath206 to @xmath226 .",
    "the choice of the averaging area is motivated as follows .",
    "first , in order to avoid any influence of the inner accretion boundary we have moved the inner integration radius about 10 grid cells away from it .",
    "second , we are interested to examine the inner part of the disk , since it is the region where the magnetization is changing predominantly and it is the launching area for the most energetic part of the jet .",
    "third , we want to avoid large magnetic gradients affecting our averaging area .",
    "although most of jet energy is launched from region broader than this small area , the area is seen as representative .",
    "we emphasize that the profiles of the jet power along the disk surface are similar for all simulations . in all cases we investigated , we find that the _ general _ behaviour of the physical outflow or disk quantities with respect to underlying disk magnetization does not depend on the area where the averaging is done ( neither on the location nor on the size ) .    keeping all other parameters the same , we have carried out simulations varying the initial magnetization @xmath227 and the strength of the magnetic diffusivity @xmath142 . for all our simulations , starting with different initial magnetization , @xmath228 , @xmath229 , @xmath230 , we find that the interrelation between the different jet or disk quantities and the disk magnetization , is essentially the same .",
    "we therefore present only one group of simulations , namely that with @xmath229 .",
    "although the initial magnetic field strength differs , we can already suspect at this point that it is the _ actual _ rather than the initial strength of the magnetic field in the disk that governs the disk accretion and ejection of the jet , and , thus , playing the major role in the launching process .",
    "this has not yet been discussed in the literature so far , as most publication parametrize their simulations by the initial parameters .",
    "an exception might be @xcite , who pointed out substantial changes in the disk plasma beta during the time evolution . while the initial magnetization does not play a leading role for the launching process",
    ", it is , as was previously shown , responsible for the magnitude of overall torque exerted on the disk .",
    "an interesting representation of the evolution of the main disk - jet quantities are ( @xmath231)-plots , where x stands for the examining variable .",
    "note , that in these plots the time evolution is hidden .",
    "as it was shown by @xcite , there is a link between the mean accretion mach number and the disk magnetization . in our terms",
    "this relation can be expressed as @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the magnetic shear , @xmath234 and where the plus sign denotes a variable estimated on the disk surface .",
    "note that in our case there is no viscous contribution and the factor @xmath235 appears in the relation since the accretion mach number is calculated using adiabatic sound speed .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_b_mumr ] shows that setting @xmath233 to constant @xmath236 ( thus @xmath237 ) is a good first approximation , especially for the strong magnetization cases .",
    "as we will see in the next section , in case of a weak magnetic field the magnetic shear @xmath233 behaves far from being constant .",
    "the closer examination of the magnetic shear @xmath233 reveals a presence of two different jet launching regimes .    .",
    "the linear approximation @xmath237 is shown by the dashed black line . , width=302 ]      a tight relation exists between the magnetic shear @xmath233 and the ratio between the toroidal and poloidal magnetic field components .",
    "we define the magnetic shear @xmath233 by the radial electric current at the disk midplane , since it does not require to apply the notation of the disk surface , which , in case of a strong magnetic field , might change by up to 40 percent .",
    "note , that the magnetic shear is the first derivative of the accretion mach number with respect to the magnetization .",
    "therefore it shows the growth rate of the local mach number or steepness of the curve .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_mujbx ] shows the magnetic shear with respect to the underlying inner disk magnetization .",
    "we see that the magnetic shear behaves in two different ways - in case of low magnetization , @xmath238 , the magnetic shear is substantially higher in comparison to the case of high magnetization , @xmath239 .",
    "the explanation is straightforward : there is a turning point concerning the generation of the toroidal magnetic field versus flux losses through the disk surface ( by the outflow ) . to understand",
    "this one needs to set apart the generation processes of the toroidal magnetic field from the loss processes .",
    "the rate of the generation of the magnetic field in keplerian disks is primarily set by the structure of the magnetic field and is rather constant in case of a quasi steady state on the other hand , the outflow speed ( through the disk surface ) is highly dependent on the actual disk magnetization . in case of a weak magnetization",
    "the outflow speed is rather small , which makes it possible to sustain a stronger magnetic shear . a strong disk magnetization results in a fast outflow , thus setting the maximum limit for the magnetic shear .",
    "the magnetic shear has a great impact on the outflow launching .",
    "we confirm this finding by presenting the mass and energy ejection and accretion fluxes .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_mumx ] shows the ratio of the mass ejection rate , @xmath240 , to the accretion rate , both averaged over the same area . obviously , the ejection efficiency is higher for weaker magnetized disks .",
    "this is easy to understand considering equation  [ eq : btbp ] . in case of a weak magnetic field ,",
    "the strong magnetic shear ( the high toroidal to poloidal magnetic field ratio ) leads to faster poloidal acceleration , caused by the force component parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "this force also extracts the matter from the disk . in case of a strong disk magnetization ,",
    "the acceleration of a matter is primarily supported by the centrifugal force .",
    "we note that studying the ejection index ( calculated within an area @xmath241 ) with respect to the mean disk magnetization leads to very similar results , that is a saturation to values of about 0.35 - 0.40 in case of a high magnetization and a significant increase in case of a low magnetization .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_muex ] shows the ratio of the energy ejection density to the average accretion energy , computed in the same way as for the mass fluxes .",
    "compared to the mass fluxes , the energies show the opposite behaviour - the ejection to accretion power is increasing function with magnetization .",
    "this is a highly important relation , since it relates two observables .",
    "note that following our findings , there is not a fixed value for the ratio between jet and accretion power .",
    "this should be considered when comparing observational results to the theory .",
    "essentially , this result shows the general importance of the magnetic energy flux compared to the mechanical energy .",
    "the mechanical energy flux is always negative , while the magnetic energy flux is positive . in case of a strong magnetic field",
    "our results are similar to , namely that magnetic energy flux dominating the mechanical flux .",
    "we also see a saturation of the flux ratio in case of a moderately strong magnetization .",
    "we find that in a weak magnetization case the energy flux ratio can be very small .",
    "we also find that the ejection mach number , equation  [ eq : ejmach ] , increases almost linearly with magnetization .",
    "essentially , the _ general _ behaviour of the mass and energy flux ratios does depend on the averaging area or its position .",
    "the accretion power ( see appendix , equation  [ eq : accpow ] ) is mainly determined by the accretion rate at the inner disk radius . assuming a typical scale height for the mass accretion as @xmath242 , the accretion power can be estimated considering the magnetic shear and the actual magnetization of the disk , @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the unit power ( see appendix  [ app : units ] ) .    in case of strongly magnetized disks",
    "one can assume that the magnetic shear is approximately constant @xmath245 , and this relation transforms into @xmath246 .",
    "note that this result connects two essential quantities - the accretion power which manifests itself by the accretion luminosity to the disk magnetization , which is intrinsically hidden from the observations .",
    "in this section we discuss the commonly used diffusivity model and the reasons why we think that it fails in case of very long - term simulations , in particular when treating weakly magnetized disks . in order to overcome this problem - the accretion instability - we propose another magnetic diffusivity model .",
    "this new model enables us to simulate the evolution of the disk - jet system for much longer times .",
    "the simple idea that the induction of the magnetic flux in steady state is compensated by the flux losses , both by diffusion and magnetic flux escape through the disk surface , becomes hardly applicable in case of a weak magnetic field . as discussed previously ( see section  [ sec : andiff ] ) , in order to keep the magnetic field distribution properly bent , the magnetic diffusivity parameter @xmath142 must be linked to the anisotropy parameter @xmath136 . equation  [ eq : curv ] was obtained considering the standard magnetic diffusivity model .",
    "a more general relation can be derived assuming a curvature of the magnetic field of about 0.5 , that is the mean curvature of the initial field distribution ( see equation  [ eq : bpot ] ) , @xmath247 solving this inequality for @xmath119 and assuming @xmath248 , we find @xmath249 where @xmath250 , and @xmath251 in our simulations .",
    "this relation shows that in order to keep the disk magnetic field properly bent , the @xmath119 should behave differently in the two limits of magnetization . a linear relation to the magnetization in case of a strong magnetic field , and proportional to the square root of magnetization in case of a weak field . in case of a strong deviation from this relation ,",
    "the magnetic field structure will be substantially affected , resulting in a high field inclination ( for @xmath252 ) , or a strong outward bending ( for @xmath253 ) .",
    ".,width=302 ]    for equation [ eq : asslim ] we have implicitly assumed a linear relation between the ejection mach number ( at the disk surface ) and the magnetization . in fact",
    "our simulations approve such an interrelation .",
    "figure  [ fig : def_mumx ] shows that for a moderately strong magnetic field , there is a linear relation between the ejection mach number and underlying disk magnetization .",
    "this behaviour is also consistent with ejection to accretion mass flux ratio we haqve discussed above .    as a consequence of equation  [ eq : jrjphi ] ,",
    "the @xmath119 plays a direct role in determining the strength of the poloidal electric current with respect to the toroidal current .",
    "we find in our simulations that in order to sustain jets , the ratio of the poloidal to the toroidal current should be sufficiently high ( about 15 ) .",
    "the difficulty in performing simulations of weakly magnetized outflows is that the specific torques may _ increase _ towards the disk surface area , just because of the low densities over there .",
    "this will lead to a layered accretion along the disk surface , and , thus , much lower accretion along the midplane .",
    "although this might be a relevant process in reality , our numerical setup is not suited for the treatment of such a configuration .",
    "the standard , commonly used magnetic diffusivity model is parametrized by two constants , @xmath142 and @xmath136 . in general , choosing a high anisotropy parameter @xmath136 implies a low diffusivity parameter @xmath142 .",
    "together , this will lead to a decrease in the poloidal electric current and an increase in the toroidal current ( see equation  [ eq : jrjphi ] ) .",
    "thus , the resulting torque will not be sufficient to brake the dense matter along the midplane , and will lead to layered accretion .",
    "an anisotropy parameter lower than unity has proven to lead to a smoother time evolution , since it allows for stronger poloidal currents at the midplane , and , thus , a mass accretion which is developed over the full disk height .",
    "another option to have @xmath254 would be to modify the vertical diffusivity profile such that it reaches the maximum not at the disk midplane , but at the disk surface .",
    "this would also help to develop a strong electric current in the disk midplane .      here",
    ", we discuss another problem , which the standard diffusivity model is prone to .",
    "as previously shown , most of the simulations suffer from the mass loss from the disk , leading to the increase of the magnetization .",
    "however , the increase of the magnetization further amplifies the mass loss .",
    "this is known as the accretion instability , first studied by @xcite , and later confirmed for more general cases @xcite .",
    "if , on the other hand , the diffusivity is too high ( chosen by a high @xmath142 parameter ) , inevitable diffusion of the magnetic field will lead to the situation that a jet can not be sustained anymore .",
    "we like to emphasize that the main reason for the increase of magnetization is the mass loss , but not the actual magnetic field amplification .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the accretion instability , namely , a lack of sufficient feedback that could bring the accretion system back to a stable state .",
    "in other words , in order to run long - term simulations one needs to apply a diffusivity model that provides a stronger feedback to the diffusivity profile than the standard choice @xmath255 .",
    "the direct consequence of the accretion instability is that the magnetization increases towards the center .",
    "it is easy to show that the behaviour of the magnetization has to be opposite . in accretion disks producing outflows",
    ", the mass accretion rate must naturally increase with radius . assuming a radial self - similarity of the disk and taking into account that the accretion mach number is linearly related to the magnetization and that @xmath256 , one derives @xmath257 where @xmath195 is the ejection index and @xmath47 represent the power law index of a physical quantity @xmath42 . considering that magnetized disks are very efficient in producing outflows , @xmath258",
    ", one may expect @xmath259 to be positive ( if @xmath260 ) , thus , an increasing function with radius .",
    "the disk structure itself can be re - arranged such that @xmath261 , that eventually will satisfy the relation [ eq : muxics ] .",
    "this is indeed what we find .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that this equation is a rough estimate and might be subject to the different disk physics involved .",
    "if the magnetic torque is not the only supporter of the accretion as in case of viscous simulations of the above presented relation might be relaxed .",
    "however , the similar analysis can be performed to set the limit of the magnetization with respect to other quantities .      in this section",
    "we present a diffusivity model , which does not suffer from the accretion instability .",
    "although the standard diffusivity model gave us an opportunity to probe a wider parameter space , it is not applicable for very long - term studies .",
    "we emphasize that the transition from the a direct simulation of turbulence to the mean field approach , which lacks the small scales by design , is indeed subtle .",
    "so far , in the literature , the jet launching problem is addressed without considering the origin of the magnetic field by a dynamo .",
    "therefore , the only way of amplifying the magnetic field is by advection ( or stretching in case of a toroidal field ) .",
    "there is also no intrinsic angular momentum transport by the turbulence itself .",
    "the only term we need to model when applying a small scale turbulence , is the effective magnetic diffusivity .",
    "this might have surprising consequences . in order to suppress the turbulence",
    ", one should rather _ amplify _ the effective diffusivity - leading to a stronger decay of the magnetic field and resembling the quenching of diffusivity ( or dynamo ) - rather than decrease it - leading to stronger advection and thus an amplification of the magnetic field .",
    "the main motivation of our new model for the diffusivity - is to consider stronger feedback by the disk magnetization .",
    "we overcome the accretion instability by assuming a stronger dependence of @xmath119 on the magnetization , @xmath262 where we choose @xmath263 and @xmath264 . here",
    "we keep the previous overall form and constants , indicating that both models are the same at the magnetization @xmath171 .",
    "a quadratic dependence on @xmath129 was chosen in order to amplify the feedback . choosing a lower power than two might have revealed other complications , for example a feedback too weak to work fast enough , and",
    "keep @xmath119 under the constraint of equation  [ eq : asslim ] .",
    "we will refer to this diffusivity model as _ strong diffusivity model_.      applying our strong diffusivity model enables us to overcome the accretion instability . as a result",
    ", we were able to perform our simulations for _ much _ longer times , reaching evolutionary time steps of @xmath265 which corresponds to approximately 25,000 revolutions at the inner disk orbit .",
    "figure  [ fig : mu2_cocoon ] shows the typical computation domain and the initial dynamics of the system . as usual , the evolution starts with the propagation of the toroidal alfvn wave , resulting in a propagating cocoon . at this point ,",
    "the innermost area ( @xmath266 ) has reached a quasi steady state , while the outer part has not even slightly moved from the initial state .",
    "figure [ fig : mu2_big ] presents the same simulation at a later state when a strong outflow has been developed .",
    "notice the difference between the inner part , @xmath267 and the outer part , @xmath268 .",
    "the inner part has already relaxed to a steady state , while the outer region shows rapid accretion and ejection patterns .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the new diffusivity model .",
    "the logic behind implementing the enhanced feedback is valid only when the accumulation of the flux is possible .",
    "the initial imbalance between advection and diffusion in the outer part leads to a rapid advection of the magnetic flux to the inner disk . as a result",
    ", the rapid accretion further leads to higher inclination angles of the magnetic field ( smaller angle with respect to the disk surface ) .",
    "this results in a higher efficiency for the toroidal magnetic field induction , thus leading to even more rapid accretion and ejection .",
    "figure [ fig : mu2_tevol ] shows a long term evolution on a small sub - grid of the simulation with our strong diffusivity model . as can be seen , until time @xmath269 only a small fraction of the disk has dynamically evolved ( up to @xmath270 ) , while at later times also the outer parts of the disk do reach a new dynamic state .",
    "a steady outflow establishes from the whole disk surface ( shown on this sub - grid ) , and reaches super - fast magnetosonic speed .",
    "note that the positions of the critical mhd surfaces are constant in time , which is a further signature of a steady state .",
    "the outflow reaches maximum velocities typically of the order of 100 @xmath271 for yso , or 70,000 @xmath271 in case of agn . concerning observationally relevant scales ,",
    "our simulations compare to the following numbers .",
    "our numerical grid is comparable to 150au for yso , and 0.14pc in case of agn physically more meaningful is the grid size where our simulation has reached a steady state .",
    "that is a size comparable to 25 au for yso , and 5000 au in case of agn , but can be extended by running the simulations longer .",
    "the dynamical time scale of 150,000 time units ( or 25,000 disk orbits ) corresponds to about 550 years in case of yso and about 200 years in case of agn .",
    "typical accretion rates of our simulations are @xmath272 for yso , and @xmath273 in case of agn , but one has to keep in mind that these values depend not only on the intrinsic scaling of central mass and inner disk radius , but also on the scaling of density .",
    "therefore , we herewith present the most extended and longest mhd simulations of jet launching obtained so far - connecting the jet launching area close to the central object with the asymptotic domain which is accessible by observations .    although a spherical grid is computationally very efficient and may allow to extend the computational domain to almost any radius , in reality its application for the jet launching simulations is somewhat limited .",
    "there are two reasons for that .",
    "first , it takes obviously much longer time for the outer disk areas to evolve into a new dynamical steady state .",
    "thus , outer disk will remain close to the initial state of the simulation for quite some time .",
    "second , and a more severe drawback is the lack of resolution for the asymptotic jet . for example , for distances @xmath274 along the rotational axis , the jet radius of about @xmath275 can be resolved only by about 5 grid cells ( applying our typical resolution ) .",
    "we therefore restrict our computational domain for such grid size to about @xmath276 .",
    "the above mentioned resolution issue is in fact one of the advantages for using cylindrical coordinates for jet formation simulations .                      by design , the purpose of our strong diffusivity model was to avoiding the accretion instability . as a consequence of this application ,",
    "magnetization profile does not decrease with radius ( see figure  [ fig : comp_mu ] ) although both simulations ( with standard and strong diffusivity model ) start from the same initial disk magnetization , the disk evolution results in a quite different magnetization distribution . the standard diffusivity model ( our reference simulation from above )",
    "results in a magnetization profile decreasing with radius .",
    "in contrast , for the strong diffusivity model a rather flat magnetization profile emerges . in non - viscous simulations , assuming radial self - similarity , a flat ( or not decreasing with radius ) profile is essential for sustaining a continuous accretion flow at any given radius .",
    "as soon as a steady state is reached , the evolutionary track for this simulation is represented by a simple dot in all ( @xmath231)-diagrams ( at least from 1000 to 150,000 time units ) .",
    "the mean inner disk magnetization is @xmath277 .",
    "we find that this simulation fits to every relation presented above , such as mass and energy flux ratios , or magnetic shear , that were derived applied a standard diffusivity model .",
    "in other words , the aforementioned dots belong to the curves drawn in the ( @xmath231)-diagrams .",
    "there are several distinct features one can derive from the resulting magnetic field structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : mu2_btbp ] shows the toroidal to poloidal magnetic field component ratio .",
    "taking into account that the disk magnetization ( calculated from poloidal component only ) is uniform , three different regions can be distinguished .",
    "the first region is between the midplane and the disk surface where the toroidal magnetic field reaches its maximum and the torques change sign .",
    "the second region is between the disk surface and the alfvn surface where the ratio of the field components is quite constant .",
    "the third region is beyond the alfvn surface when the poloidal component of the magnetic field becoming weak enough to keep a rigid magnetic field structure and toroidal component starts to dominate the poloidal one .            .",
    ", width=302 ]      in this subsection we further explore the disk structure in a steady state . in figure",
    "[ fig : mu2_profiles ] we present the radial profiles of certain magnetohydrodynamical variables along the midplane .",
    "we show the profiles derived from our numerical simulations with thier approximations by power laws , and compare them to the initial distribution .",
    "these radial profiles are obtained along the disk midplane , however , they also hold at least for one disk semi - height",
    ". the thetoidal profiles that normalized to the corresponding midplane value ( not shown here ) almost coincide with each other , indicating that the assumption of a self - similar disk is in fact reasonable , though different power indexes should be used .",
    "in particular , figure  [ fig : mu2_profiles ] shows how the disk structure evolves from a certain initial power law distribution into another power law profile .",
    "we see distinct power law profiles for radii up to @xmath278 .",
    "this corresponds to the area where the disk evolution has reached a steady state . for very small radii @xmath279",
    "we also see a deviation from a power law profile , that we consider as a boundary effect .    at time",
    "@xmath280 , we find the following numerical values for the power law coefficients @xmath47 for the different variables at the midplane @xmath281 .",
    "the disk rotation remains keplerian throughout the whole time evolution , thus @xmath282 .",
    "the radial profiles for density and gas pressure slightly change from their initial distribution .",
    "the density power low index changes from @xmath283 to @xmath284 , while for the pressure it changes from @xmath285 to @xmath286 . for the accretion velocity",
    "we find a profile of @xmath287 , and @xmath288 for the magnetic field . as a consequence ,",
    "the profile for the magnetization remains about constant @xmath289 .",
    "the accretion velocity remains subsonic over the whole disk with an accretion mach number of @xmath290 .",
    "following and considering the mass accretion @xmath291 it is easy to get the ejection index @xmath292 .",
    "this is in accordance with previous work @xcite .",
    "our strong diffusivity model , equation  [ eq : strongdiff ] , does not _ necessarily _ lead to a flat magnetization profile .",
    "the model does not directly force the magnetization to be uniformly distributed - in opposite , the profile is expected to be outwardly increasing . as we previously showed the magnetization profile is linked to the ejection index and it has to be positive if the sound speed stays as initially distributed .",
    "what we found is that the disk hydrodynamics changes such that the magnetization of the disk remains flat , thus satisfying equation  [ eq : muxics ] .",
    "another way of reasoning is the following . in case of a flat magnetization profile the result of the simulation is not sensitive to the diffusivity model anymore . in other words ,",
    "it is possible to switch back from the new diffusivity model to the standard model when the radial magnetization profile is uniform ( along the midplane ) .",
    "however , the diffusivity parameter @xmath142 has to be correspondingly re - normalized .",
    "the only substantial deviation from a uniform profile is in the innermost disk , which might be influenced by the boundary condition .",
    "in fact , we performed such a test simulation , switching back from strong diffusivity to standard diffusivity model .",
    "as expected , the accretion instability starts to manifest itself similarly as before , leading to the typical magnetization profile ( increasing towards the center ) .",
    "however , it takes much longer time to substantially affect the outer parts of the disk .",
    "the steady state solution achieved when using our strong diffusivity model , perfectly fits to the results obtained by the standard model ( shown previously as a dot on the plots ) .",
    "this actually approves our understanding that the main agent in driving outflows is the _ actual _ magnetization , and that the magnetic diffusivity is only the _ mediator _ through which the magnetic field structure is being governed .",
    "a self - consistent treatment of turbulence is not feasible yet in the context of outflow launching .",
    "therefore , what should be considered at first place , is the resulting magnetic field strength and distribution , but not the diffusivity model itself .",
    "we have presented results of mhd simulations investigating the launching of jets and outflows from a magnetically diffusive accretion disk .",
    "the time evolution of the disk structure is self - consistently taken into account .",
    "the simulations are performed in axisymmetry applying the mhd code pluto 4.0 .",
    "in contrast to previous work we have applied a _",
    "spherical _ coordinate system and numerical grid , which implies substantial benefits concerning the numerical resolution and the stability ( in time evolution ) of the simulations .    in particular",
    ", we have obtained the following results .",
    "\\(1 ) our numerical setup in spherical coordinates for disk - jet related problems is very robust .",
    "the use of spherical geometry in the context of the outflow launching can not be underestimated .",
    "it allows to study the launching of outflows for very long time ( more than 150,000 time units ) on highly resolved ( up to 24 cells per disk height ) and at the same time very large ( 1500 @xmath293 ) domains . on the other hand",
    ", a spherical grid somewhat limits the study of jet propagation , since the resolution far from the origin becomes low . the rather low resolution in the outer disk region , where the dynamical timescales are long , helps to smooth out small - scale disturbances , thus helping in establishing a steady state .",
    "\\(2 ) our study has approved a robust disk - outflow structure , however for the highest resolution the evolution is prone to have some more fluctuations .",
    "the ability to evolve the disk for very long time disentangles the complex interrelations between the essential quantities for the jet launching .",
    "those are the disk actual magnetization ( at a certain time and averaged for a certain location ) , the mass , energy and angular momentum fluxes , and the jet terminal velocity .",
    "our main result is that it is the _ actual _ rather than the initial disk magnetization that plays a key role for the jet formation and directly affects the accretion power .",
    "the value of the _ initial _ magnetization can fail to properly characterize the disk - jet properties , but sets the overall jet torque and the disk s magnetic reservoir .",
    "this becomes obvious for very weakly magnetized disks ( @xmath294 ) . in this case , when choosing a low magnetic diffusivity , the magnetic flux can still be accumulated to a high magnetization in the inner disk .",
    "we find that the actual magnetization necessary for sustaining a stable jet is of order of @xmath295 , in accordance with .",
    "\\(4 ) we showed that the ejection mach number in case of moderately strong magnetization ( @xmath296 ) is linearly related with respect to the disk magnetization .",
    "this is indeed consistent with the linear to magnetization mass ejection to accretion relation .",
    "the mass ejection index ( the ratio between ejection and accretion ) is about 0.3 and thus similar to the literature values .",
    "\\(5 ) we found that in case of uniform magnetization , the mhd disk quantities show a self - similar structure , i.e. resulting in approximately the same vertical profile , and a radial power law distribution . in case of the strong diffusivity model we have presented the corresponding power law indices for all mhd quantities ,",
    "although we believe that these power law indices may directly depend on the actual strength of the magnetization .",
    "this would be a natural consequence of the ejection index being a function of magnetization as well .",
    "\\(6 ) we showed that there are two principally different regimes for outflow launching , complementary to each other . in case of weak magnetic fields ( below @xmath297 )",
    "we see signatures of a strong magnetic shear , which results in less powerful , but more efficient ( higher ejection index ) outflows . in case of a higher magnetization ,",
    "the magnetic shear , the ejection efficiency and the energy ejection to accretion flux ratio do not strongly depend on the magnetization    \\(7 ) we found the upper theoretical limit for the parameter specifying the anisotropy @xmath136 in the magnetic diffusivity in case of the standard diffusivity model , essentially depending on the actual magnetization in the disk . in the limit of low magnetization",
    "the anisotropy parameter must satisfy @xmath298 .",
    "\\(8 ) we showed that in non - viscous steady state , assuming radial self - similarity , the magnetization profile should be non - decreasing function of radius . in steady state",
    ", jet launching disks must have a radially increasing profile of the mass accretion rate .",
    "this is a requirement of a positive ejection index .",
    "taking into account that i ) the accretion mach number is proportional to the magnetization and ii ) assuming that the radial profile of the sound speed does not strongly deviate from keplerian , we showed that the index of the magnetization profile is non - negative .",
    "this is paper i in a series of papers , that studies the long term evolution of outflow - generating disks . in two follow - up papers we will present the i ) connection of the jet properties ( the potential observables ) with the underlying disk quantities , and we will ii ) extend the present setup to simulations including a disk magnetic field that is self - generated by a mean - field dynamo .",

    "we appreciate many helpful discussions with andrea mignone and also competent suggestions by the unknown referee .",
    "the simulations were performed on the theo cluster of max planck institute for astronomy .",
    "this work was partly financed by the sfb 881 of the german science foundation dfg .",
    "here we write up the typical normalization to be used to apply our code units to different astrophysical jet - launching objects , such as young stellar objects ( yso ) , and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",

    "<S> the time evolution of the disk structure is self - consistently taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to previous works we have applied _ spherical _ coordinates for the numerical grid , implying substantial benefits concerning the numerical resolution and the stability of the simulation . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the new setup we were able to run simulations for more than 150,000 dynamical times on a domain extending 1500 inner disk radii with a resolution of up to 24 cells per disk height in the inner disk . depending on the disk magnetization , jet launching occurs in two different but complementary regimes - jets driven predominantly by centrifugal or magnetic forces . these regimes differ in the ejection efficiency concerning mass , energy and angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is the _ actual _ disk magnetization and not so much the initial magnetization which describes the disk - jet evolution best . considering the actual disk magnetization we also find that simulations starting with different initial magnetization evolve in a similar - typical - way as due to advection and diffusion the magnetic flux in the disk evolves in time . exploring a new , modified diffusivity model we confirm the self - similar structure of the global jet - launching disk , obtaining power laws for the radial profiles of the disk physical variables such as density , magnetic field strength , or accretion velocity . </S>"
