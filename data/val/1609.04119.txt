    "transmission through noisy communication channels is a key problem of information theory .",
    "when the quantum nature of information carriers is taken into account , their interaction with the noisy environment is properly described in terms of quantum channels . the classical capacity ,",
    "i.e. , the maximal rate of errorless transmission of classical information via a quantum channel is one of the important figures of merit . in general , finding this quantity is a highly non - trivial optimization problem .",
    "nevertheless , this problem was recently solved for a wide class of quantum channels with a gaussian noise  ( so - called gaussian quantum channels )  @xcite which are good models of common physical systems such as free space or fiber optics communications ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the gaussian quantum channels attracted much attention in the last decades  @xcite ; however , only a few results on their classical capacity were known  @xcite .",
    "one of the attempts to approach this problem was to restrict the search for optimal states and encodings by gaussian states and gaussian distributions  @xcite .",
    "the solution of such reduced optimization problem gives the so - called gaussian classical capacity  @xcite which was actively studied during the last years  @xcite .",
    "although the gaussian capacity is _ a priori _ a lower bound on the actual capacity this quantity is of great interest in practice , because the gaussian states are more accessible in experimental realizations .",
    "recently , the progress in finding the gaussian capacity became even more important because it was proved that the classical capacity of bosonic gaussian quantum channels with thermal noise is indeed achieved by gaussian ensembles of ( pure ) gaussian input states  @xcite .",
    "if input energy is sufficiently high , this result also leads to finding the classical capacity in the case of squeezed thermal noise  @xcite .",
    "in both cases the calculations were technically performed in terms of the gaussian capacity .",
    "however , the equivalence of the gaussian and classical capacity is not yet known for small input energies .",
    "the study of gaussian capacity in this region  @xcite provides a way to find a lower bound on the classical capacity with the hope that equivalence of this bound and the ( actual ) classical capacity will be eventually proven as well .",
    "in addition , the analysis of the properties of the gaussian capacity may give a further insight helping to find such a proof .",
    "in this work we focus on the gaussian classical capacity of single - mode gaussian quantum channels and calculate the one - shot ( or single - letter ) gaussian capacity of the fiducial channel  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that this is equivalent to finding the gaussian capacity of an arbitrary single - mode gaussian channel  @xcite .",
    "this equivalence is based on the fact that any single - mode gaussian channel can be expressed as the fiducial channel preceded by a rotation and followed by a symplectic transformation ( in some cases  only if a proper limit is also taken ) .",
    "we also go beyond the known results on the gaussian capacity and present the solution which is valid for all values of input energy .",
    "then , we analyze the obtained gaussian capacity as a function of the channel parameters . in particular , we find its rich behavior as a function of the noise squeezing .",
    "the present work generalizes previous results obtained for the single - mode lossy ( or attenuation )  @xcite and additive noise  @xcite gaussian channels .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec : chgauss ] , we briefly review gaussian quantum states and gaussian channels . in section  [ sec : capgauss ]",
    ", we introduce the single - mode fiducial gaussian channel and calculate its gaussian capacity . in this calculation",
    "we use a _ _ frequency representation__-representation introduced in  @xcite for lossy channel . ] for the covariance matrices to get a better insight about the physical meaning of the solution . in section  [ sec : chpara ] , the behavior of the capacity as a function of the channel parameters is analyzed .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the results .",
    "quantum mechanics in continuous variables can be introduced as weyl calculus on the system s phase space @xmath0  @xcite ( below we consider only single - mode case , i.e. , 1-d harmonic oscillator ) . in this representation a quantum state",
    "is specified by its wigner function @xmath1 [ @xmath2 is a vector of canonical variables @xmath3 and  @xmath4 , which is a weyl symbol of the density operator @xmath5 acting on the hilbert space and @xmath6 belonging to @xmath7 is @xmath8 = i$ ] ( @xmath9 ) , and normalization of a wigner function is @xmath10 . ] @xmath11 .",
    "a gaussian probability density density @xmath12 with the mean @xmath13 is the wigner function of a quantum state if @xmath14 is a quantum covariance matrix ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , i.e. , its symplectic eigenvalue @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "such quantum states are called gaussian .",
    "since their higher momenta are functions of the first two , these states are completely specified by the mean value @xmath13 and the covariance matrix @xmath14 .",
    "the gaussian channel @xmath17 is defined as a completely positive trace preserving map ( cptp ) which maps gaussian states to gaussian states @xcite .",
    "its action on the first two momenta of any state is completely defined by the real matrix @xmath18 , a displacement @xmath19 and the real , symmetric and positive matrix @xmath20 , where @xmath20 can be considered as the covariance matrix of an _ effective noise_. the three parameters determine the action of @xmath17 on an input state with displacement @xmath21 and covariance matrix @xmath22 leading to the output state determined by displacement @xmath23 and covariance matrix @xmath24 , i.e. @xcite @xmath25 if the input state is gaussian , given by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , then the output state of the channel is also a gaussian state given by @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in order to satisfy the conditions of a cptp map @xmath26 has to satisfy @xcite @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the symplectic matrix @xmath29 in the following , the parameters @xmath30 will be of a particular interest because @xmath31 may be considered as a channel transmissivity ( if @xmath32 ) or amplification gain ( if @xmath33 ) , while @xmath34 characterizes the added noise .",
    "note that any single - mode covariance matrix @xmath35 can be diagonalized by a symplectic transformation corresponding to a rotation in the phase space which preserves the _",
    "symplectic eigenvalue _",
    "@xmath15 , as well as the degree of squeezing of the state : @xmath36 here the parameter @xmath37 accounts for the amount of squeezing of the state with cm @xmath35 and @xmath38 the meaning of the coefficient @xmath39 will be clear if we compare it with the number of photons @xmath40 defined as the expectation value of the number operator @xmath41 which it takes in the state @xmath42 .",
    "the number of photons is related to the energy of the state given by the trace of its covariance matrix as follows @xmath43=\\frac{1}{2}({\\mathrm{tr}}[{\\bm{v}}]-1).\\ ] ] for a thermal state , i.e. @xmath44 , equations and imply that @xmath45 .",
    "furthermore , let us notice that for arbitrary @xmath37 the covariance matrix @xmath35 in the diagonal form is identical ( up to dimensional factors made of @xmath46 ) to the covariance matrix ( expressed in natural units ) of a thermal single - mode state of @xmath47 photons and _ optical frequency _",
    "( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "inspired by this similarity we call @xmath47 the number of _ thermal photons _ and @xmath37 the `` frequency '' of the state",
    ". thus all pure states have zero temperature and zero thermal photons , @xmath48 .",
    "although in our case @xmath37 does not represent any optical frequency the similarity has a deep physical root .",
    "indeed , given the number of thermal photons @xmath47 , the energy of the state is determined by both the optical frequency and the degree of squeezing .    the symplectic eigenvalue @xmath49 and the number of thermal photons @xmath47 of the covariance matrix @xmath35 of a single mode state are important parameters in what follows since they can be used to calculate the von neumann entropy of gaussian states .",

    "then , any cm @xmath35 of the form can be transformed by a symplectic ( squeezing ) transformation to the cm of a thermal state ( @xmath44 ) with the same number of thermal photons @xmath47 as the initial @xmath35 . noting that this transformation corresponds to a unitary transformation of the corresponding density operator which preserves the von neumann entropy",
    ", we recover a well known fact that the von neumann entropy of any single - mode gaussian state is a function of the number of thermal photons @xmath47 given by eq .",
    "the one - shot ( single - letter ) _ gaussian capacity _ is the maximal transmission rate of classical information when we are restricted to the use of gaussian input states and gaussian encodings such that different uses of the channel are not correlated .",
    "the energy constraint is always imposed on the input state because the unconstrained capacity is trivially infinite . the recently proven additivity conjecture together with the proof of the minimum output entropy conjecture ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) assert that the gaussian capacity is the classical capacity for phase - insensitive gaussian channels ( in case of squeezed gaussian noise this holds if the input energy exceeds a certain threshold ) .",
    "however , in the absence of the full proof embracing all gaussian channels and the entire input energy regime we distinguish the gaussian capacity @xmath54 from the classical capacity @xmath55 .",
    "the former reads  @xcite : @xmath56=2{\\bar{n}}+1\\}}\\chi_g,\\\\          \\chi_g & = g\\left({\\bar{m}_{\\rm out}}\\right)-g\\left({m_{\\rm out}}\\right ) .",

    "the explicit dependence of the gaussian capacity on @xmath58 .",
    "the average ( modulated ) input state with cm @xmath57 is realized by a gaussian distribution of the displacements of pure gaussian states with the same cm @xmath22 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "that is why entropies which enter the general formula for the capacity are expressed in terms of functions of thermal photons @xmath59 and @xmath60 corresponding to the _ output _ and _ modulated output states _ with cm @xmath24 and @xmath61 given by @xmath62 , \\quad { \\bar{{\\bm{v}}}_{\\rm out}}={\\phi}[{\\bar{{\\bm{v}}}_{\\rm in}}].\\ ] ] the input energy constraint is expressed in terms of the mean number of photons @xmath58 in the modulated input state .",
    "we showed in  @xcite that the problem of calculating the gaussian capacity of an arbitrary gaussian channel @xmath17 can be reduced to calculating the capacity of a _ fiducial _ gaussian channel @xmath63 , which is defined in our parametrization by @xmath64 where parameter @xmath34 is a function of @xmath31 , namely , @xmath65 note that @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond to the perfect transmission channel .",
    "otherwise , @xmath68 corresponds to a lossy channel , @xmath66 a classical additive noise channel , @xmath69 an amplification channel , and @xmath70 a phase - conjugating channel .",
    "although in the case of the classical additive noise channel the cm of the noise @xmath71 defined in strictly speaking does not correspond to a valid `` state '' of the environment , we will loosely apply the term `` squeezing '' parameter to @xmath72 for all channels .",
    "the solution of the optimization problem has already been obtained and intensively discussed for the lossy channel and classical additive noise channel ( see  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively ) . in the present paper",
    "we generalize those results to the most general single - mode gaussian channel .    in eq .",
    "one has to maximize over the two covariance matrices @xmath22 and @xmath57 with the energy constraint @xmath58 stated in eq .  , and",
    "the constraint that the input state is pure , i.e. @xmath73 we can straightforwardly use theorem 1 of  @xcite ( since the resulting equations are of the same form ) to conclude that the optimal covariance matrices @xmath22 and @xmath57 are diagonal in the same basis as the _ effective noise _ cm @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , in the following any covariance matrix @xmath35 will be considered to be diagonal . as a consequence ,",
    "the cm of the optimal output state and optimal modulated output state read @xmath74 where @xmath75 now we present the solution to the optimization problem stated in eq .  .",
    "first , we derive a solution that will only be valid above an input energy threshold , and secondly , we present the solution for input energies below this threshold .",
    "we start from an obvious bound on the gaussian capacity , which follows from eq .",

    "this idea was used , for example , in @xcite . however , by considering implications of the energy constraint in , which @xmath57 should respect , we will find the limitations of this method .",
    "let us start by finding the maximum of the first term of eq .",
    "using the fact that the two terms are independent .",
    "since @xmath77 is a monotonously increasing function it is sufficient to maximize its argument in order maximize its value .",
    "we can express the argument @xmath60 in the first term of in terms of the mean number of photons @xmath78 of the modulated output state , i.e. @xmath79 -1\\right ) .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ] then , since @xmath78 is fixed for a given number of input photons @xmath58 and channel parameters @xmath31 , @xmath34 , and @xmath72 ( see eq .  ) the only free parameter in @xmath60 is the frequency @xmath80 of the modulated output state .",
    "its optimal value , which maximizes @xmath60 in eq .  , is easily found : @xmath81 which implies that @xmath82 this corresponds to the well - known fact that given a finite energy the thermal state maximizes the von neumann entropy .",
    "next we find the minimum of the second term on the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "in the same way as we maximized the first term by maximizing the argument @xmath60 , it is enough here to minimize the argument @xmath59 .",
    "the number of thermal photons at the output @xmath59 can be expressed in terms of the input frequency @xmath83 from definitions and , where @xmath83 is the only free parameter .",
    "then it is straightforward to find that the value of @xmath59 is minimized when the squeezing parameter of the input state is equal to the one of the noise @xmath84 in terms of frequencies one may say that the input and environment modes are `` in resonance '' .",
    "this also means that the optimal input state should have the same squeezing as the state of the environment .",
    "together with the uniform distribution of energy between the quadratures of the modulated output ( thermal ) state this is also a single - mode form of _ quantum water - filling _ ; a type of solution found also in multimode problems , which corresponds to equal variances of all quadratures of all modes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "using eq .",
    "we can express @xmath59 which corresponds to this solution in a simple form @xmath85 together with eqs .",
    "- this implies furthermore , that the input and the output state are `` in resonance '' as well , i.e. @xmath86    the cm of the modulated input state can be expressed from the obtained results using the equation @xmath87 which directly follows from eq .  .",
    "then the number of thermal photons @xmath88 and the frequency @xmath89 are obtained following definitions and from the cm @xmath57 and the input energy constraint in the form @xmath90 after several steps we obtain @xmath91 and @xmath92    here we should make an important note that the modulated state with cm @xmath57 is obtained by averaging over displacements of the input letter state with cm @xmath22 and therefore , the right hand side of eq",
    ".   should be a positive definite matrix .",
    "this requirement together with eqs .   and",
    "can be jointly satisfied by some @xmath22 and @xmath57 only if the input energy is above the following threshold : @xmath93 - \\frac{1}{2}.\\ ] ] hence , only for @xmath94 , the covariance matrices @xmath22 and @xmath57 found above determine the input letter state and modulated average input state which saturate the upper bound on the gaussian capacity , and therefore realize the gaussian capacity .",
    "this shows the limitation of the attempt to minimize and maximize terms in eq .   independently .    using the results obtained above we can express in a closed form the gaussian capacity of the fiducial channel as a function of the channel parameters and the input energy constraint : inserting into eq .",

    "and we can easily recover the well - known solution for thermal noise ( @xmath96 ) , which implies @xmath97 and @xmath98 meaning that the optimal encoding corresponds to a displacement of coherent input states for so - called _ thermal _ or _ phase - insensitive _ channels ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thanks to the recently proven minimum output entropy conjecture @xcite eq .",
    "provides not only the gaussian capacity but the classical capacity for an arbitrary single - mode gaussian channel @xmath17 as proven in @xcite , i.e. @xmath99      now we derive the solution for the case when the input energy is not enough to satisfy the water - filling solution .",
    "up to now a solution for this case is known only for the lossy @xcite and additive noise channels @xcite .    by definition of @xmath100",
    "the condition @xmath101 implies that eqs .   and could only be satisfied if ( at least ) one of the diagonal terms of the difference @xmath102 was negative .",
    "however , this would be unphysical because @xmath57 is the cm of a state which is a mixture of states with cm @xmath22 .",
    "this means that the formal maximum of eq .",
    "lays outside the physically admissible region of optimization parameters and therefore the real ( physically admissible ) maximum lays in fact at the boundary of this region .",
    "this boundary is formed by the modulated input cm @xmath57 with ( at least ) one diagonal term being equal to the corresponding diagonal term of the non - modulated input cm @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the optimal encoding only uses one of the two quadratures for information transmission ( modulating neither of them is clearly not optimal ) . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the @xmath103-quadrature of the noise is squeezed and therefore @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , we chose the ( more noisy ) @xmath3-quadrature to be no longer modulated:@xmath105 and argue below why this choice is optimal .    since below the input energy threshold , there is no valid @xmath22 and @xmath57 which saturate independently the minimum and maximum of , we have to maximize the whole expression on the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "therefor we use in the following the method of lagrange multipliers .    note that for the case @xmath94 the optimization problem can be formulated in terms of the three parameters @xmath83 , @xmath89 and @xmath88 satisfying the input energy constraint   [ where furthermore , only pure input states are considered , see eq .  ] .    for the case",
    "@xmath101 we can use the new constraint given by eq .   to express @xmath88 in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath89 , which together with eq .",

    "with respect to the pair of variables @xmath83 , @xmath80 .",
    "in addition , we will replace the input energy constraint @xmath58 by the output energy constraint @xmath78 which is equivalent to the original one for fixed channel parameters @xmath107 as one can see in eq .  .",

    "an extremum of the lagrangian fulfills @xmath110 where the gradient reads @xmath111 before taking the derivatives , recall the condition @xmath112 , which implies eq .   and therefore @xmath113",

    "was simplified using eq .  .",
    "by equalizing the right hand side of eq .   to zero we recover the bose - einstein statistics for the amount of _ thermal photons _ in the modulated output state @xmath116 which means that the multiplier @xmath117 can be regarded as an _ inverse temperature _ of the state .",

    "was already derived previously in by several authors @xcite , and in particular , for the lossy channel with phase sensitive noise in  @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of the lagrange multiplier @xmath117 as an inverse temperature ( intensive parameter ) becomes more meaningful in the case of an `` ensemble '' , which in our case corresponds to a set of parallel single - mode channels with a priori different noises @xcite .",
