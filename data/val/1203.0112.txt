    "the initial state comes into play , because it determines probabilities for such dynamical conditions to be satisfied . in the present work ,",
    "we analyze the ability of a specific proposal for the initial state , the no boundary wave function of hartle and hawking in this respect .",
    "to be precise , we are calculating approximate probabilities for the field to find itself as a sharply peaked wave packet at various locations in the potential .",
    "these can then be used for further dynamical considerations because such a wave packet then evolves further according to the classical equations of motion and may get trapped by a local minimum , or roll in an unstable direction forever . in the following ,",
    "we describe the moduli stabilization problem and the no boundary proposal in more detail .",

    "einstein gravity is not renormalizable ; while , if we introduce string theory , then all quantum corrections can be manifestly finite . however , to obtain a consistent quantum theory , ( super ) string theory requires ten dimensions .    a rather traditional approach to reducing dimensions is to compactify extra dimensions .",
    "it is known that a calabi - yau manifold can maintain supersymmetry , so that it can be possible to obtain a four - dimensional effective supersymmetric action .",
    "another approach is not to compactify extra dimensions , and to stipulate that we are attached to a d - brane ; extra dimensions can be sufficiently large , or extra dimensions can be warped so that all gauge fields can be confined on three - branes .",
    "the latter approach is a viable and interesting idea , but the existence of such a brane combination and a metric ansatz should be explained in the context of string theory .    in terms of a bottom - up approach ,",
    "the traditional compactifying scenario is rather rigorous .",
    "however , there is a well known problem , that of _ moduli stabilization_. when we compactify extra dimensions to a compact manifold , there are continuous degrees of freedom that determine the size or shape of the compact manifold . after integrating out the extra dimensions ,",
    "the degrees of freedom become a number of fields in the four - dimensional effective action , the moduli fields .",
    "there is no fundamental mechanism to stabilize these fields , and thus no fundamental mechanism keep the size and shape of the compactified manifolds fixed .",
    "of course , one may believe that the fields can be initially fixed to have a certain value .",
    "however , there is no way to prohibit the movement of the fields during an evolution of the universe , and then it becomes very strange to see a stable compactified universe at the present time .",
    "a solution of this problem requires at least two conditions to be satisfied :    1 .",
    "all moduli fields must have potentials and the potentials must have local minima .",
    "if the potential has a non - compact region in which the sign of the slope is negative ( ` run - away region ' ) the probability for the system to end up in this region should be strictly smaller than one .",
    "the best - known mechanism for satisfying the first condition is the so - called _ flux compactification _ @xcite , which we will discuss in the next paragraph . in this article , for a given toy model of flux compactification",

    "the natural tendency of moduli fields is to collapse so that they tend to become smaller and smaller .",
    "however , the existence of flux tends to enlarge the size of the manifold .",
    "so , there can be a stable equilibrium , in which two forces  collapsing and repulsing  cancel each other .",
    "this flux compactification is an important mechanism to stabilize moduli fields .",
    "however , the properties of the induced potential now become important , in particular the potential energies at the local minima .",
    "anti de sitter vacua are quite natural in string theory , but our universe is not described by anti de sitter space . to obtain a de sitter vacuum ,",
    "one has to violate supersymmetry .",
    "one successive model to violate supersymmetry and to obtain a de sitter vacuum is the model of kachru , kallosh , linde , and trivedi @xcite . in their model , they introduced d3-branes and anti d3-branes .",
    "since they require tadpole cancelation , the only quantum effects in their calculation are non - perturbative .",
    "they violate supersymmetry and eventually lift up the potential from anti de sitter to de sitter .",
    "the level of uplift is determined by the number of anti d3-branes .",
    "the number of anti d3-branes is a free parameter , and hence each value of the vacuum can be chosen arbitrarily .",
    "as the number of fluxes changes , so does the allowed vacuum energy .",
    "the number of vacua can be huge , so that there is effectively a continuous spectrum of cosmological constants ( so called _ discrituum _",
    "@xcite ) .    in this article",
    ", we study a simple model ( halliwell @xcite and blanco - pillado , schwartz - perlov , and vilenkin @xcite ) , which we will call the hbsv model . let us begin with the six - dimensional action : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are coordinates , @xmath4 is the six - dimensional cosmological constant , and @xmath5 is the field strength tensor of the maxwell field . now , assuming the metric ansatz @xmath6 and the maxwell field @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 $ ] and the compactified coordinates are just a sphere @xmath10 $ ] , we obtain four - dimensional effective action after integration out : @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in this article , we choose the four - dimensional planck units @xmath15 .",

    "the former property is useful to explain the moduli stabilization problem and the latter is useful to understand the basic nature of huge numbers of flux vacua , the so - called cosmic landscape .",

    "each different flux can be approximated by some fields , so that each vacuum corresponds to different field values according to the complex potential of the fields .",
    "then , tunneling from one vacuum to another vacuum can be described by the tunneling of a scalar field with a certain potential .",
    "the huge number of different vacua that can be approximated by the potential of a scalar field is called by the _ cosmic landscape_.    the huge number of different vacua can be on the order of @xmath17 .",

    "therefore , the cosmic landscape can explain that there can be a huge number of different universes .",
    "however , this does not necessarily imply that such universes should exist .",
    "to realize a vacuum of the landscape , susskind considered the eternal inflation .",
    "since an eternal inflation would never end , at a certain time , tunneling will realize _ all _ possible vacua , as pocket universes .",
    "the totality of pocket universes are called the _ multiverse _ , and , by definition , the multiverse has infinite volume and is formed by an infinite number of all possible pocket universes .    if the multiverse picture becomes a concrete scientific hypothesis , it can assign probabilities to each pocket universe @xcite .",

    "can it have implications for the measure problem of the multiverse ?",
    "at least , hartle , hawking , and hertog @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite believed so , and they argued that the no - boundary wave function does not prefer a multiverse @xcite@xcite , and even though there is eternal inflation , the no - boundary measure is still meaningful and it will give some expectations about the multiverse @xcite@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , some authors have believed that the expectation of the no - boundary proposal is contradictory with the multiverse picture @xcite@xcite and hence the wave function of the universe is not useful to understand the nature of the multiverse measure .",

    "in addition , since we live in a de sitter universe , the further requirements are natural :    * various vacuum expectation values , including positive vacuum energy , should be allowed , and hence lead to a cosmic landscape . * with a view to observations , a small positive cosmological constant and a sufficent inflationary history should be preferred .",

    "in this paper , we investigate the no - boundary measure in string theory : in the context of moduli stabilization , flux compactification , and cosmic landscape .",
    "the simple model that compactifies @xmath0d to @xmath1d ( hbsv model ) is used as a concrete toy model .",
    "section  [ sec : sym ] : : :    to study fuzzy instantons , the study of the tachyonic potential around    the local maximum is very important . if the ratio between the negative    mass square @xmath214 and the vacuum energy    @xmath204 decreases , then we observe slowly - rolling fuzzy    instantons . in this case",
    ", the probability depends on the initial    conditions .",
    "we call this case _ slow - rolling fuzzy instantons_. on the    other hand , if the ratio sufficiently increases , the field relatively    quickly moves and hence the dependence on the initial conditions    disappears .",

    "these two observations are applied to the hbsv model : classical histories are allowed only for the local maximum , and the probability will not crucially depend on the initial conditions ( fast - rolling fuzzy instantons ) .",
    "therefore , _ the no - boundary measure can explain the stabilization of the hbsv model_. moreover , we can assert the _ a priori _ probability of the cosmological constant .",
    "it naturally prefers to be anti de sitter , but a zero cosmological constant is not a special or singular region .    finally , we try to generalize to the context of the cosmic landscape .",
    "perhaps , the no - boundary measure extremely prefers anti de sitter to de sitter .",
    "this can be a fundamental property of the no - boundary measure .",
    "if we believe the principle that _ a probability of a given gravitational system is determined by the entropy , which is the same as the euclidean action _ , then it will be a natural consequence .    however , this crucially depends on the details of the potential and the choice of the boundary condition of the universe .",
    "thus , we are not ready to conclude with definite results , or to say for certain whether the no - boundary measure is consistent with string theory or not . we have already obtained some evidence that the no - boundary measure partly explains the stabilization of the moduli fields and the dilaton field @xcite .",
