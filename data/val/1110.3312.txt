    "a new class of young emission line galaxies , named green peas @xcite , was recently discovered by volunteers in the galaxy zoo project @xcite .",
    "they are particularly interesting because of their small size and their extraordinarily large [ oiii ] equivalent width ( up to @xmath41000  ; see fig .",
    "[ sdss ] ) , which indicates a large population of hot young stars .",
    "they turn out to be low mass galaxies ( m@xmath5 @xmath6 ) with high star formation rates ( @xmath7 @xmath8 ) .",
    "hence they have some of the the highest specific star formation rates of up to @xmath9 @xmath10 were obtained by @xcite .",
    "typical peas have @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . ] seen in the local universe .",
    "this indicates very short stellar mass doubling times ( @xmath14yrs , which is @xmath15 times the hubble time ) , whereas typical star forming galaxies have stellar mass doubling times comparable to the hubble time . due to their small reddening ( @xmath16 ) and luminous uv emission this class of star forming galaxies is similar to uv luminous galaxies observed at high redshift ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "their relatively low metallicities ( log[o / h ] + 12 @xmath48.7 ) and locations in under - dense environments suggest that peas started building their stellar content at @xmath17 by processes similar to those experienced by high redshift lyman-@xmath18 emitters and lyman break galaxies . it has been suggested by @xcite that peas may have systematically larger [ n / o ] ratios , and therefore potentially even lower metallicity than reported by @xcite .",
    "though unresolved by the sdss , requiring typical angular sizes @xmath191  which gives physical sizes @xmath195 kpc , some peas had serendipitous hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations .",
    "their patchy irregular appearance in resolved hst snapshots possibly due to compact star forming regions @xcite , mimics the morphologies of high redshift galaxies .",
    "given high star formation rates , peas are expected to host a large number of supernovae .",
    "supernovae accelerate electrons to high energies , which may then emit synchrotron radiation in radio bands .",
    "we have performed a stacking experiment with archival very large array ( vla ) first @xcite data at 1.4 ghz to demonstrate that their fluxes are systematically different from those of usual starburst galaxies but are statistically akin to those of lbgs , which have systematically lower fluxes than local starbursts at a given star formation rate @xcite .",
    "we have followed up three peas with deep observations at 0.6 ghz using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . in this letter",
    "we establish and discuss the properties of peas as a new class of sub - millijansky sources in the ghz radio sky .",
    "we use theoretical considerations to show that these radio detections imply large magnetic fields for peas .",
    "this raises puzzling questions about the origin and evolution of magnetic fields in young galaxies .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "radio emission from most normal galaxies is due to synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons and free - free emission of ionized hydrogen ( hii ) regions .",
    "both of are produced by massive stars ( @xmath20 ) which end their bright but short lives ( @xmath21 yr ) in supernovae . during their lifetimes these stars",
    "ionize the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) and create hii regions .",
    "shocks produced by supernovae accelerate a majority of the relativistic electrons in normal galaxies .",
    "these electrons have short lifetimes ( @xmath22 yr ) ; hence radio emission in a normal galaxy traces recent star formation activity .",
    "the non thermal radio brightness of a typical star forming galaxy is given by @xcite as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is luminosity distance in mpc .",
    "variations in the normalization of the nonthermal synchrotron emission are traced by @xmath25 , which is @xmath26 for the milky way and local starbursts @xcite . with high star formation rates ,",
    "young star forming galaxies like lbgs and peas are expected to have some nonthermal radio emission . however , to date no direct radio emission has been reported . in lbgs , stacking techniques @xcite have been used to overcome large distances . with peas",
    ", we have a local sample to search for their radio emission both by stacking existing vla data ( section [ vla ] ) and by additional observations with gmrt ( section [ gmrtobs ] ) .     detection threshold ( in mjy ) and",
    "signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for a simulated stacking experiment with n brightest peas .",
    "note that the snr rises and then falls with n , so stacking all available peas is not optimal .",
    "we stack @xmath27 peas in this work .",
    "highest estimated fluxes for peas fall just short of the vla first survey threshold of @xmath26 mjy @xcite at 1.4 ghz , so they need to be detected by stacking .",
    "see @xcite for extensive discussion of techniques for stacking first images to detect sources below the survey threshold .",
    "here we use a summation based approach , rather than a median based approach , as this gives higher signal to noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "this is because , the convergence of the sample mean to the population mean is unbiased and faster than the convergence of the sample median to the population median @xcite .",
    "conventional wisdom suggests that summing up n images of faint objects produces a increase in snr by @xmath28 this implies that stacking all available objects is the best strategy .",
    "however , this strategy can be bettered if some flux estimate is available .",
    "we estimate the expected fluxes of all 80 spectroscopically identified star forming peas from @xcite using eq [ eq : nth2 ] with @xmath29 in a flat @xmath30cdm cosmology with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , with star formation rates derived from their optical spectra ( see figure [ sdss ] ) .",
    "in this situation it is best to stack the n galaxies with the highest expected fluxes . in figure [ snr ]",
    "we show that the snr rises rapidly in the range @xmath33 and falls off slowly beyond @xmath34 .",
    "we therefore stack @xmath35 ( the nearest power of 2 ) of the brightest expected peas .",
    "the images of these @xmath36 regions were cut out and summed in pairs , with this process being repeatedly applied to the resulting @xmath37 maps until the final map ( fig . [ first ] ) was obtained .",
    "this was done to avoid a sequential summation , which results in the addition of large floating point numbers with small ones in the latter steps , leading to accumulation of rounding errors . in our method , the numbers being added are always comparable",
    ". the final image ( fig . [ first ] ) has noise which is well described by a gaussian with @xmath38 mjy .",
    "the stacked total flux is found to be @xmath39 mjy instead of the expected @xmath40 mjy for @xmath29 , summed over all n peas using eq [ eq : nth2 ] for a standard starburst template .",
    "the probability of a statistical fluctuation of this size and larger is @xmath41 .",
    "this indicates that the average radio fluxes of peas are systematically suppressed , compared to usual starburst galaxies , by a factor of @xmath42 .",
    "thus , as in lbgs @xcite , peas have a comparable but systematically lower flux when compared to local starbursts .    .",
    "the unresolved @xmath43 source in the centre is due to the peas .",
    "the only other significant detection , the resolved source to the right of the image , is due to the unrelated _ first j133926.7 + 151655_. ]    [ first ]",
    "the result from stacking demands confirmation at other frequencies , especially in terms of direct radio detection of peas . hence , we targeted the 3 most promising candidates , with expected fluxes at the mjy level , using deep gmrt observations .",
    "we detect two of them as unresolved point sources and put an upper limit on the third .",
    "these results show that not all peas may be characterized by a single @xmath25 .",
    "observations with @xmath44 hours of on - source time for each pea , were carried out at 617 mhz ( bandwidth 32mhz , split into 512 channels ) .",
    "visibility data have been analyzed using astronomical image processing system ( aips ) @xcite .",
    "initial calibrations of the data were done using various flux calibrators and phase calibrators ( see table [ gmrt ] ) .",
    "the flux calibrators were observed at the beginning and the end of the respective observations in order to fix the antennae gains .",
    "the phase calibrators , chosen within @xmath45 of the source position on the sky , were observed every half an hour to calibrate the phase drift due to ionospheric effects .",
    "the data were edited for the removal of bad antennae , baselines and any radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "the data were binned into seven channels to maximize snr without compromising on chromatic aberration .",
    "target visibilities were extracted from gain and bandpass calibrated data .",
    "the task imagr was used on this data to obtain a preliminary dirty map .",
    "cleaning was done to remove the beam pattern for all @xmath46 and brighter sources . repeated self calibration and cleaning was done till it yielded consistent solutions",
    ". the source flux was then extracted with the task jmfit from the final map , with a typical resolution of @xmath47  .",

    "relativistic electrons produce bulk of the ghz radio emission in star forming galaxies",
    ". they must remain confined long enough in the galaxy s magnetic field to significantly contribute to the radio emission .",
    "we use the criteria derived here , to constrain the characteristic magnetic fields in section [ magdiff ] .",
    "these electrons traveling at speeds close to that of light get scattered by the galaxy s magnetic field .",
    "their diffusion coefficient is determined by the structure of the magnetic field .",
    "we assume following @xcite that the field structure is comprised of domains of radius @xmath57 ( typically 0.3 kpc according to @xcite ) with randomly oriented magnetic field @xmath58 in each of these domains .",
    "for the range of feasible electron energies , the larmor radius is smaller than the magnetic coherence length , thereby providing an energy independent diffusion coefficient @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the diffusion timescale for relativistic electrons to escape from a typical pea of size 3 kpc @xcite , is @xmath60 this can be compared to the timescales of radiative processes to gauge their relative importance .",
    "electrons may lose their energy before diffusing out of a galaxy via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering .",
    "an explanation of the systematically lower fluxes of the lbgs suggested by @xcite , is ic cooling of relativistic electrons scattering off cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "if this is indeed the cause , the effect should be negligible for peas as the cmb radiation density in the universe has fallen off considerably in the epoch between lbgs ( @xmath1 ) and peas ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "electrons can lose their energy through ic .",
    "ic has the same dependence on the photon energy density as synchrotron has on the magnetic field energy density @xcite .",
    "this implies the ic energy loss timescale ; @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the energy density in radiation or photons .    for ic losses to be significant",
    ", @xmath63 has to be comparable to @xmath64 .",
    "this condition gives the required @xmath62 as @xmath65 the energy density of the cmb photons is given by @xmath66 this gives the time scale for ic losses against cmb photons as @xmath67 comparing this to @xmath64 , we get the redshift , at which the electrons lose a significant fraction of their energy to cmb photons , as @xmath68 this may be a significant effect for very high redshift ( @xmath69 ) galaxies . thus cmb ic cooling of relativistic electrons may have a role in explaining the systematic lowering of lbg radio fluxes .",
    "however it can not have any significant role in the case of peas which are at @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite suggested that radio emission from compact starbursts in ultra - luminous infrared galaxies may be suppressed due to ic losses against the radiation energy density produced by its own young stellar population . comparing the ic loss timescale to the electron diffusion timescale",
    ", we have obtained the required energy density in eq .",
    "the typical value of @xmath62 , required for ic losses to significantly suppress the synchrotron flux at ghz frequencies , is much larger than the milky way value of @xmath70 but less than the higher values of upto @xmath71 which are seen by @xcite in compact starbursts .",
    "so it is possible that some peas may have suppressed radio fluxes as a result of ic losses against their own radiation density leading to a wide range of observed values for @xmath25 .",
    "one out of three peas observed by gmrt showed no detectable flux ( table [ gmrt ] ) .",
    "we therefore estimate @xmath62 in this galaxy from its sdss spectra , applying appropriate bolometric correction for a starburst galaxy .",
    "we find an @xmath72 which rules out ic cooling of electrons as the cause for suppression of radio luminosity .",
    "hence the upper limit of flux from this object allows us to limit the magnetic field using the diffusion and equipartition arguments .",
    "to explain the observed radio emission from peas as synchrotron loss from electrons , the magnetic field must be large so that electrons lose enough energy before they diffuse out .",
    "this can be used to constrain magnetic fields in peas .",
    "since cmb ic can not account for the systematic lowering of pea radio fluxes we explore another explanation suggested by @xcite for the suppression of lbg fluxes .",
    "cosmic rays may diffuse easily from systematically smaller galaxies in the early universe before they can lose their energy via synchrotron emission .",
    "since peas are of sizes comparable to lbgs @xcite this effect should be observable in peas .",
    "here we use the observed radio emission to derive the magnetic field of a pea , by comparing the electron diffusion @xcite and synchrotron energy loss timescales @xcite .",
    "thus we get a magnetic field required to explain the observed radio flux ; @xmath73 where the magnetic coherence length @xmath57 has a typical value of 0.3 kpc @xcite . using @xmath42 at @xmath74 ghz ( from stacking experiment ) and characteristic size @xcite @xmath75 of 3 kpc",
    ", we obtain a typical magnetic field of @xmath76 .",
    "thus the electron diffusion argument provides us with a direct estimate of the characteristic magnetic field in peas .",
    "we show here that the previous estimate of magnetic field does not lead to absurd energy requirements .",
    "an independent estimate of magnetic field can be obtained from energy minimization considerations .",
    "the so called _ equipartition magnetic field _ can be estimated by minimizing total energy invoked in relativistic particles and magnetic fields , in order to explain the observed flux .",
    "the magnetic field corresponding to the minimum energy condition of @xcite in a synchrotron plasma can be derived from radio observations .",
    "we follow the derivation of @xcite with the typical value of the cosmic ray proton / electron energy ratio @xcite @xmath77 , and a typical spectral index of @xmath78 @xcite for the radio spectrum , to derive the equipartition magnetic field as @xmath79 if the actual magnetic field is different from this value , the energy required to explain the synchrotron emission goes up very rapidly .",
    "it has been argued by @xcite that the real magnetic field is limited to differ at most by an order of magnitude above and below the equipartition value derived in this manner . from the stacking experiment the mean flux of the peas",
    "is @xmath80 mjy .",
    "while they are unresolved at vla first resolution , serendipitous hst observations @xcite provide their characteristic size as 3 kpc ( where @xmath81 is @xmath82 kpc at their typical redshift ) .",
    "this fixes the characteristic equipartition magnetic field of peas at @xmath83 .",
    "the surprising agreement between the estimates of pea magnetic fields derived from two independent methods , points to a characteristic magnetic field of @xmath84 which is comparable to or even larger than the average milky way value of @xmath85 .",
    "we report the first radio detection of peas and show that this discovery implies large magnetic fields in peas , using reasonable assumptions about cosmic ray diffusion and total energy considerations .    given that the peas are very young galaxies ( around one hundredth the @xmath86 yr age of the milky way ) the discovery of radio emission and the implied @xmath87 g magnetic fields is a striking result .",
    "present day magnetic fields are thought to be the result of amplification of seed fields ( @xmath88 ) by dynamo action @xcite over the galaxy s lifetime .",
    "these models for the growth of magnetic fields have e - folding times @xcite of @xmath89 yr .",
    "they produce 20 @xcite to 50 @xcite e - folds of an efficient dynamo during the lifetime of the milky way .",
    "hence , they can only play a small role in amplifying the pregalactic @xcite magnetic fields within the age of a pea .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that galaxy - wide @xmath3 level magnetic fields may be generated by magnetized plasma produced in jets from a central compact object .",
    "even this is unlikely as we are considering only the star forming peas and not the seyfert peas .",
    "our results strongly favor the suggestion from @xcite that seed fields were amplified significantly by turbulence ( up to @xmath3 level pregalactic fields ) as protogalaxies and similar substructures formed .",
    "as peas are close analogs to lbgs it seems likely that young primeval galaxies could have had strong enough magnetic fields to seed the intergalactic magnetic field @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested by @xcite that magnetic fields may play a crucial role in star formation . observed magnetic fields in nearby galaxies scale slowly with the sfr @xcite but it is likely that magnetic fields strongly affect the star formation efficiency @xcite . in such a scenario , presence of strong pregalactic magnetic fields may be the reason why peas have started to produce stars at such a large rate .",
    "most theoretical and computational studies of reionization era assume lack of dynamically significant magnetic fields , during formation of first stars .",
    "our results may require a rethinking of this assumption , in presence of @xmath3 level pregalactic magnetic fields . a detailed study of processes at work in peas in the nearby universe , will help us understand magnetic field amplification in early galaxies , its role in star formation , supernova feedback and cosmic ray acceleration .",
