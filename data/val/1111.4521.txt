    "the gp - b experiment aims at testing in earth orbit two predictions of einstein s general relativity using precision gyroscopes .",
    "this idea was independently proposed by pugh @xcite and schiff @xcite @xcite in 1960 .",
    "both of these authors pointed out that according to the general theory of relativity , the angular momentum axis of a gyroscope in orbit about the earth will precess about a direction normal to the orbital plane due to the gravitational interaction of the spinning gyroscope with its orbital motion , and simultaneously about the direction of the earth s rotation axis due to the interaction of the spinning gyroscope with the angular momentum of the earth .",
    "the first effect is known as the geodetic effect , and the second is known as the frame - dragging effect . on a 640 km polar orbit , the gyroscope drift rate due to the orbital motion about the earth is 6.6 arcsec / yr ( 32 @xmath6rad / yr ) , while the orbital average drift rate due to the earth s angular momentum is 0.041 arcsec / yr ( 0.20 @xmath6rad / yr ) .",
    "gp - b uses four gyroscopes spinning in a quasi torque - free environment and placed inside a drag - free satellite .",
    "the orientation of the gyroscopes is known thanks to an on - board telescope pointing towards a distant guide star , whose orientation with respect to an extra - galactic source is known . furthermore , the satellite rolls about the telescope axis . as the orientation of the satellite with respect to an inertial reference frame",
    "is nonetheless known , reference frames linked to the satellite are qualified as inertial throughout this paper .",
    "gp - b s scientific goal can be fulfilled by measuring the orientation of the gyroscope s spin axis with respect to the satellite .",
    "the gyroscopes are superconductive , which allows tracking of the orientation of their angular velocity vectors .",
    "indeed , a spinning , superconducting body creates a magnetic dipole parallel to its spin axis , the london moment @xcite @xcite .",
    "this magnetic dipole is then an excellent indicator of the direction of the instantaneous spin axis . since the gyroscopes are almost perfectly spherical and uniform ( @xmath7 ) , the spin axis direction is a very good indicator of the direction of the angular momentum .",
    "low - noise superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometers are thus used to measure the magnetic flux through a pick - up loop placed around each gyroscope created by the london moment plus a contribution due to a magnetic field trapped in the rotor .",
    "the squid signal is proportional to the magnetic flux through the pick - up loop .",
    "the squid output is an analog signal which , on board the satellite , is split into a low frequency ( lf ) channel  which contains the london moment contribution  and a high frequency ( hf ) channel . both hf and lf channels pass through a @xmath8 hz low pass analog filter .",
    "the lf channels then passes through an additional 4 hz analog low pass filter and an additional gain stage . in this paper , we are only concerned about the hf channel , which is sampled at @xmath5 hz and digitized with a 16 bit adc with a range of @xmath9  10  v. this adc provides a resolution higher than the signal - to - noise ratio which is @xmath10 near the gyroscope spin frequency .",
    "we refer to this digitized high resolution signal as the `` hf squid signal '' .    when each gyroscope transitioned below its critical temperature , the flux due to the residual magnetic field surrounding it before the transition was trapped on its surface , forming a large number of small magnetic sources .",
    "these sources are called fluxons , and can be pictured as rigidly linked to the surface of the body , as shown for instance in @xcite .",
    "a consequence is that the fluxons exactly follow the motion of the body and create modulations , on the order of a few volts , at a frequency close to the spin frequency of the gyroscope : these modulations constitute the hf signal .",
    "the hf squid signal is sent intermittently in the form of 1.86 second long stretches that we refer to as `` snapshots '' .",
    "each snapshot contains 4096 points .",
    "we also have access to this signal in the form of fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) performed at regular intervals on the squid signal by the on - board cpu .",
    "the fft is applied every 10 seconds to sets of 4096 points of raw data , and a compacted form of its output is sent to the ground .",
    "an on - board fft algorithm is applied to @xmath4 second - long stretches of hf squid signal and can thus resolve frequencies @xmath11 sec = @xmath12 hz apart .",
    "this frequency resolution , called a bin , is poor : the fft data is thus further processed .",
    "this additional processing is performed on the ground , and requires computing the fft at a few frequencies .",
    "the value of the fft at the first five harmonics of the signal frequency and the one corresponding to the @xmath13 hz calibration signal are thus telemetered .",
    "in addition , the value of the fft at the two bins adjacent to each one of these six frequencies are also sent down , as well as the zero - frequency term . for each @xmath4 second - long data stretch",
    ", the on - board fft algorithm thus provides 19 data points .",
    "since the high frequency data is sampled at @xmath5 hz , the initial data stretch contains @xmath14 points and so does its fft , so transmitting 19 data points is a dramatic reduction in bandwidth .",
    "additionally , raw snapshots of the squid signal are also sent down on an irregular but frequent basis .",
    "these snapshots also consist of @xmath4 second - long data stretches sampled at @xmath5 hz .",
    "an example of the time history of a portion a snapshot is provided in the upper pane figure [ fig : snapshot ] , while the fft of the entire shapshot is shown in the lower pane .",
    "( color online ) snapshot ( time - series and spectrum ) for gyroscope 1 , taken november 10 , 2004 , width=377 ]    in this paper , we describe the method that was used to determine the frequency of this hf signal , and therefore the rotor spin speed , with a resolution better than @xmath2 nhz .",
    "this was critical for the gp - b data analysis because it allowed the time - varying readout scale factor to be determined to 1 part in @xmath15 , the orientation of the spin axis with respect to the spacecraft to be determined to @xmath16 3 marcsec in 1 orbit , and the gyroscopes relativistic drift rates to be determined to @xmath17 marcsec / yr @xcite .",
    "the time - varying scale factor is caused by the trapped flux contribution to the magnetic flux through the pick - up loop , which varies at the rotor spin @xmath9 spacecraft roll frequency , the rotor polhode frequency and at low frequency . with an accurate estimate of the rotor polhode and the estimate of the rotor spin speed to 30 nhz ( discussed here ) the body - fixed orientation of the gyroscope rotor with respect to the spacecraft",
    "was determined with an accuracy of @xmath16 1 deg throughout the entire science mission , lasting 1 year .",
    "this information was necessary to determine the distribution of trapped flux on the surface of the rotor and the time varying readout scale factor @xcite .    before delving into the 3 successive frequency estimation algorithms ,",
    "we introduce notations specific to the gp - b experiment in order to explain the relationship between the gyroscope motion and the squid signal .",
    "we then describe how frequency interpolation and phase differencing , a time - domain technique , were applied to the fft data to achieve a 5 @xmath6hz frequency resolution .",
    "we then show that this result was checked using the snapshot data .",
    "variations of these first two techniques are known and their accuracy in determining monotone signals in the presence of gaussian white noise and simple systematic effects have been studied @xcite .",
    "finally , we show how the snapshot data and the result of the phase differencing were used to run the algorithm developed by the authors which allowed a 5 parts in @xmath0 accuracy in frequency determination .",
    "as the fluxons attached to the gyroscope move with it , hf modulations are created in the squid signal .",
    "the fluxons create a body - fixed distribution of potential : a model for this distribution can thus be written in body - fixed frame , for instance using a spherical harmonics expansion @xcite .",
    "the squid measurement however takes place in the satellite frame - which , as explained above , is considered inertial .",
    "therefore , if the appropriate set of euler rotations is applied to rotate the body - fixed frame into the inertial frame , it is possible to express the hf squid signal as a function of the coefficients of the model of the magnetic potential distribution .",
    "the vectors @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the principal inertia axes of the gyroscope and define an orthonormal body - fixed reference frame .",
    "we call @xmath21 an orthonormal inertial reference frame such that @xmath22 is aligned with the angular momentum @xmath23 of the gyroscope .",
    "the angular momentum is inertially fixed as the gyroscopes are in torque - free motion .",
    "these notations are shown in figure [ fig : bfif_part3 ] .",
    "the first euler rotation from @xmath24 to @xmath21 is an azimuthal rotation by an angle @xmath25 .",
    "this rotation transforms @xmath24 into a reference frame @xmath26 whose @xmath27 axis is aligned with @xmath20 . a polar rotation by an angle @xmath28 is then applied : the new reference frame @xmath29 is such that its third axis @xmath30 is aligned with the angular momentum . the third euler angle @xmath31 measures the angle by which the gyroscope has spun about @xmath23 since a fixed time origin : a rotation of angle @xmath32 about @xmath23 is thus also needed to obtain the inertial reference frame @xmath21 .",
    "consequently , the frequency at which any fluxon passes through the pick up loop is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the polhode frequency , such that @xmath35 .",
    "as the modulations in the hf squid signal are due to the motion of the fluxons with respect to the pick - up loop , the frequency @xmath1 of this signal is thus given by :    @xmath36    an expression for @xmath37 can be obtained from @xcite , formulas 89.4 and 90.4 :    @xmath38,\\ ] ]    where the characteristic , @xmath39 , and the elliptic modulus , @xmath40 , only depend on the moments of inertia @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the rescaled time,@xmath44 , depends on the three moments of inertia and the angular momentum , @xmath45 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath46 is the jacobi elliptic integral referred to as `` sinus amplitude '' and defined by : @xmath47 the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : first_dotphis ] ) is the larger by a factor of @xmath48 , and the second term is a modulation at twice the polhode frequency .",
    "the three euler rotations are summarized in the definition of the spin axis @xmath49 : @xmath50 the spin frequency @xmath51 is thus    @xmath52    as @xmath53 and @xmath54 can be as large as @xmath34 which is on the order of @xmath3 mhz on all gyroscopes @xcite , @xmath37 lies within @xmath3 mhz of the spin frequency @xmath51 and is thus on the order of 100 hz .",
    "the hf squid signal frequency @xmath1 is thus close to the spin frequency @xmath51 .",
    "the first two steps of the frequency determination method presented in this paper are applied to the hf squid signal in order to determine @xmath1 .",
    "the third step of the frequency determination method presented in this paper thus aims at determining @xmath37 with a @xmath17 nhz resolution . in @xcite , a procedure",
    "is given to measure the polhode frequency @xmath34 with a @xmath55 nhz accuracy .",
    "note that this represents an accuracy of 1 part in @xmath15 as the polhode frequency is on the order of 0.1 mhz .",
    "therefore , from ( [ eqn : fz ] ) , an absolute accuracy better than 30 nhz in the the determination of the frequency @xmath1 of the hf squid signal can be achieved . in relative terms , the claimed accuracy of the frequency @xmath1 determination is thus on the order of 5 part in @xmath0 .",
    "by interpolating the fft data , it is possible to go beyond the @xmath12 hz frequency resolution and to determine the frequency with a @xmath56 mhz precision .",
    "this method is well known and has been used for several decades @xcite .",
    "it consists of approximating the signal by a pure sine around its main frequency , and finding the frequency of such a sine if it had the same amplitude diagram as the fft of the signal .",
    "we now give a mathematical description of this method .    as the interpolation is applied to the fft data which is itself computed using short stretches of squid signal , we neglect the polhode harmonics in this description .",
    "we show , without loss of generality , how frequency interpolation is implemented for a single frequency signal .",
    "let @xmath57 be our signal , so that @xmath58 its discrete fourier transform is : @xmath59 }      { \\sin [ 2\\pi(f - f_z)\\delta t / 2]}\\right ] \\nonumber\\\\    & & + \\frac{a_s}{2 } e^{-i\\delta\\phi } e^{-i 2\\pi(f + f_z )      \\delta t \\frac{n - 1}{2 } }      \\left [ \\frac{\\sin\\left [ 2\\pi(f + f_z)\\delta t n /       2\\right]}{\\sin\\left [ 2\\pi(f + f_z)\\delta",
    "t / 2\\right]}\\right ]     \\label{eqn : full_fourier_cos}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where : @xmath60 is the time between two consecutive samples ( @xmath61 sec for a @xmath5 hz sampling rate ) , @xmath62 is the number of points in the fft , n@xmath60 is then the total snapshot duration , @xmath63 is the bin frequency , @xmath64 is the frequency at which the fft is computed , @xmath65 is the signal amplitude and @xmath66 is the phase shift .    near",
    "the hf signal s frequency , @xmath67 , so the first term in ( [ eqn : full_fourier_cos ] ) is dominant and we neglect the second one .",
    "since the fft is discrete , we only obtain its values at multiples of the bin frequency @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned above , we have at our disposal the value of the fft at the central bin and at the two adjacent bins .",
    "let s define the integer @xmath69 such that @xmath70 is the multiple of @xmath68 closest to the signal frequency @xmath1 .",
    "we note :      as implied by eq .",
    "[ eqn : x_n ] , the term @xmath84 here is @xmath85 at most , since near the main peak the signal frequency , @xmath1 , is at worst one frequency bin away from @xmath70 . from these relations , we derive two formulas for the frequency @xmath1 of the hf squid signal , depending on the sign of @xmath76 . for @xmath86 :",

    "indeed , the frequency computed by this method typically showed a @xmath95 @xmath6hz spread , as shown on figure [ fig : interp_output ] .    the result derived in ( [ eqn : omeg_interp ] )",
    "was obtained for the simple case of a signal with only one harmonic .",
    "however , the hf signal contains many harmonics of its main frequency , and as explained in @xcite , the odd harmonics have a significantly larger amplitude .",
    "the interpolation procedure is therefore separately applied to the fundamental frequency , @xmath1 , as well as to the @xmath96 and @xmath97 harmonics of the fft data .",
    "the results from each of those 3 interpolations are then averaged in order to obtain a determination of the signal frequency @xmath1 .",
    "results for a 6-hour long data stretch for gyroscope 1 are shown in figure [ fig : interp_output ] .",
    "( color online ) frequency @xmath1 from interpolation , gyroscope 1 , aug .",
    "19 2004 , width=321 ]    the formula ( [ eqn : omeg_interp ] ) for the signal s frequency is valid when no window is applied .",
    "applying windows to a signal consists of multiplying it by a carefully chosen function -for example , a sine square- so the frequency components away from the main frequency are attenuated @xcite . in the case of the windowed signal ,",
    "the analytical expression of @xmath1 is more complex but the principle of the derivation remains exactly the same .",
    "the interpolation method relies on the use of the amplitude of each independent fft and , in practice , yields a @xmath56 mhz or better frequency resolution .",
    "we now present an additional method called phase differencing that uses the phase of the peak fft bin , which is the one closest to the frequency of interest , at two different times .",
    "this method yields more than two additional orders of magnitude in frequency resolution .",
    "phase differencing consists of using a precise measurement of the change in the phase of the fft computed on two distinct 1.86 second - long data stretches . knowing the time elapsed between the two data stretches",
    ", we can determine the signal frequency .",
    "however , to resolve the @xmath98 ambiguity , an initial estimate of this frequency is necessary .",
    "indeed , let @xmath99 be the phase of the fft obtained at time @xmath100 and @xmath101 the phase of the fft obtained at time @xmath102 .",
    "we can assume that the frequency @xmath1 of the signal is constant if @xmath100 and @xmath102 are close ( we indeed show later that the characteristic time of the decay in @xmath1 is 7,000 - 25,700 years , depending on the gyroscope ) .",
    "we then have :    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is an integer such that @xmath105 is between 0 and 2@xmath106 .",
    "we then need to know the value of @xmath104 in order to extract the frequency @xmath1 from the previous equation .",
    "this requires knowing an estimate @xmath107 of the signal frequency so that : @xmath108.\\ ] ] the value of @xmath104 then has to be chosen to ensure condition ( [ eqn : f_est_cond ] ) .",
    "in order for @xmath104 to be known , @xmath107 must lie within @xmath109 hz of the real value @xmath64 since @xmath110 sec .",
    "this resolution is easily achieved by the interpolation algorithm .",
    "furthermore , this @xmath109 hz requirement is more stringent than the @xmath12 hz precision of the fft : the result of the interpolation is thus needed to carry out the phase differencing .",
    "then , once @xmath104 is computed , equation ( [ eqn : f_est ] ) can trivially be solved for the signal frequency @xmath1 .",
    "this new estimate has a very good precision .",
    "indeed , the phase is known with a conservative error of 10 arcsec ( @xmath111 rad ) , which at the gyroscope spin speed corresponds to a timing error of approximately @xmath112 sec , which may be compared to the short - term on - board clock accuracy of approximately @xmath113 sec .",
    "the main error term is thus the phase measurement , and for a @xmath114 sec interval , we obtain a precision better than 5 @xmath6hz .",
    "figure [ fig : phs_diff_output ] shows the extra resolution that can be achieved with phase differencing .",
    "it should be compared with figure [ fig : interp_output ] , which only shows the output of the interpolation on the same data stretch .",

    "indeed , we used a simple model for the hf signal @xmath115 which only takes into account the harmonics of @xmath1 , whereas harmonics of the polhode frequency also contribute to the signal s spectrum .",
    "these frequencies then leak into our current measurement of @xmath1 . the model introduced in the last section of this article takes into account all the frequency components of the hf signal , and yields an estimate of @xmath1 free of large variations at polhode frequency .    as a conclusion , by interpolating each fft and using phase differencing between ffts",
    ", we can obtain an estimate of the signal frequency with an error of a few @xmath6hz .",
    "we have thus gained 5 orders of magnitude as compared to the fft bin width of @xmath12 hz .",
    "furthermore , this determination only relies on estimates of the fft for a small number of frequencies being transmitted from the spacecraft .",
    "it then has the double advantage of requiring little bandwidth and using less on - board cpu time , since the interpolation and the phase differencing are carried out on the ground .",
