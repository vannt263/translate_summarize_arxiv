    "we note that the equation of of state ( [ w2 ] ) for dark energy is known from observables only without specifying any lagrangian .    in sec .",
    "[ app ] we have applied our reconstruction formula for several forms of lagrangian density : ( i ) @xmath62 , ( ii ) @xmath63 and ( iii ) @xmath64 where @xmath66 is an arbitrary function . in the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) reconstruction equations can be decomposed into two contributions coming from a kinematic term and a potential term .",
    "hence the potentials of such theories can be obtained together with the coupling @xmath3 once the evolution of @xmath13 and @xmath153 is known .",
    "the case ( iii ) corresponds to the lagrangian density for the existence of scaling solutions .",
    "one can check the existence of scaling solutions if we evaluate the r.h.s .",

    "we studied two dark energy scenarios in the absence of the coupling @xmath3 ( a ) tachyon and ( b ) generalised ghost condensate . in the case",
    "( a ) the equation of state for the tachyon field is constrained to be @xmath59 , which means that the prior ( [ weak ] ) needs to be imposed . in fig .",
    "[ tachyon ] we plotted one example for the reconstruction of the tachyon potential .",
    "the model ( b ) allows a possibility to cross the cosmological - constant boundary : @xmath17 .",
    "we carried out the reconstruction of this model by using the best - fit values coming from the gold dataset .",
    "the result is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ geghost ] , which shows that the field behaves as a phantom for the redshift @xmath154 .    in sec .",
    "[ rela ] we presented a lagrangian in generalised einstein theories which gives rise to the coupling @xmath3 by a conformal transformation to einstein frame .",
    "for example , nonminimal coupling @xmath135 is directly related with @xmath3 as given in eq .",
    "( [ xievo ] ) .",
    "this allows a possibility to determine the strength of the nonminimal coupling from observational data of @xmath13 and @xmath16 .    for the moment",
    "we have not yet obtained the accurate evolution of @xmath16 from observations of clustering .",
    "we only know the total amount of growth between the decoupling epoch and present .",
    "this is associated with the fact that all probes of clustering are plagued by a bias problem .",
    "however upcoming galaxy surveys such as kaos , lsst and panstars will pin down the matter power spectrum to exquisite accuracy , allowing the ultimate measurement of the power spectrum . by that time we should have an excellent understanding of bias and",
    "will be able to obtain the time - evolution of @xmath5 .",
    "we hope that this will provide us an exciting possibility to reveal the origin of dark energy .",
