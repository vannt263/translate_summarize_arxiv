    "have been obtained using molecular dynamics ( md ) computer simulations , in which the spatial coordinates of particles as a function of time are calculated  @xcite .",
    "more recently , experimental studies of colloids have used confocal microscopy to track individual particles  @xcite , thus generating the same type of data on microscopic particle motions as is obtained from simulations . for studying the glass transition",
    ", simulations and colloid experiments therefore serve as important model systems in which the implications of theory can be directly tested .    in both simulations and colloid experiments ,",
    "fluids have been studied in which the particle size is polydisperse . in simulations ,",
    "size polydispersity is often introduced to prevent crystallization of the deeply supercooled liquid ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . in colloid experiments , some degree of polydispersity is always present , and depends on the process by which colloid particles are produced . to characterize the polydispersity of colloids ,",

    "polydispersity can then be quantified by the value of the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 .    in most experimental studies of colloids",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) a system is regarded as effectively monodisperse if @xmath6 . for many properties , such as the average liquid structure ,",
    "this is a good approximation .",
    "however , dynamical properties , especially at the microscopic level , may depend sensitively on the nature of microscopic structural fluctuations , and so may be affected by even small polydispersities .",
    "in addition , size polydispersity in real colloids leads inevitably to a polydispersity of mass .",
    "however , some models of polydisperse liquids and colloids consist of systems in which particle size varies , but not particle mass  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we seek to isolate and quantify the role of size and mass polydispersity on the dynamics of a simple liquid system , in particular to assess the need to incorporate mass polydispersity when simulating the dynamics of realistic systems having size polydispersity .",
    "to do so , we conduct md simulations of a system of particles interacting via the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , polydisperse with respect to both mass and size , as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "our results show that a range of dynamical properties ( the diffusion coefficient , the velocity autocorrelation function , and the non - gaussian parameter ) of a polydisperse fluid are systematically shifted from the corresponding monodisperse case .",
    "we discuss the implications of these results for observations of `` dynamical heterogeneity '' in simulations  @xcite and in colloid experiments  @xcite .",
    "since our aim is to study generic effects of polydispersity on liquid dynamics , we chose the well - studied lj potential to model interparticle interactions .",
    "the lj potential is popular for simulations of simple liquids , and there exist many studies to which to compare our results .    in simulations of colloids , the colloidal particles",
    "are often modeled as hard spheres , and for many cases this a good approximation .",
    "however , interactions among colloidal particles can take other forms , and can be explicitly controlled , for example , by attaching soluble polymer chains by one end to the particle surface to generate repulsion , or by adding nonadsorbing soluble polymers to the suspension to produce attraction  @xcite . though the present work is motivated by the recent experiments studying the dynamics of colloidal particles , we do not address the question of how the behavior of a colloidal system depends on the shape of the interparticle interaction potential .",

    "[ gensize ] . in the case of real colloids , the behavior of @xmath73 as @xmath84 is complicated by the fact that solvent - induced hydrodynamic forces among particles potentially introduce strong , short - time - scale correlations of particle velocities , invalidating the free - particle assumption that is the basis of eq",
    ".  [ gauss ] . the large difference between the behavior of @xmath106 found for these systems , and that predicted by eq .",

    ", we find that the peak value of @xmath73 increases with @xmath7 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath73 has been shown  @xcite to correlate to the degree of dynamical heterogeneity present in the system : that is , transient , spatially correlated groups of particles whose characteristic structural relaxation time differs from the mean .",
    "our results therefore suggest that dynamical heterogeneity , prominently observed at lower @xmath28 and higher @xmath134 than studied here , may be enhanced as polydispersity increases .",
    "one source of this enhancement may be the influence of mass polydispersity on spontaneously occurring density fluctuations , that in turn control the development of dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "in general , the occurrence and quantification of dynamical heterogeneity in a polydisperse system is likely to be more complicated than in a monodisperse ( or even bi - disperse ) system . at the same time , since we observe a slowing of the dynamics with increasing polydispersity , the dynamical heterogeneity may be more prominent and longer - lived in a polydisperse system , and so may facilitate the study of these complex structures .    in summary",
    ", we have illustrated that a system of particles with polydispersity of both mass and size is a more realistic model ( compared to models without mass polydispersity ) for studying the dynamics of colloids in md simulations .",
    "our results show that typical polydispersities found in real systems can induce an influence of the order of 10% on dynamical properties .",
    "this is a small effect for studies , such as those near a glass transition , where relaxation times may vary by several orders of magnitude . at the same time , knowledge of the amount and direction of the impact of polydispersity on dynamics",
    "is required because polydispersity is so commonly found in systems studied both in simulations and experiments .",
    "this knowledge is also crucial for precise tests of theories , particularly those formulated for perfectly monodisperse systems .",
    "we also note that our results can be tested experimentally in colloids by deliberately varying the polydispersity of the studied colloidal system",
    ". indeed , by varying @xmath7 alone it might be possible to study an `` isothermal - isochoric glass transition '' ( i.e. a glass transition at both fixed @xmath28 and @xmath26 ) by setting up an appropriate series of colloidal systems where the polydispersity is progressively increased .",
