    "for all terms and definitions , not defined specifically in this paper , we refer to @xcite . unless mentioned otherwise , all graphs considered here are simple , finite , connected and non - trivial .    the researches on graph labeling problems attracted wide interest among researchers after the introduction of the concept of number valuations of graphs in @xcite .",
    "motivated from the problems in social interactions in social networks , a set - analogue of number valuations of graphs , called set - valuations of graphs , has been introduced in @xcite . since then , a lot of researches have been taken place on both number valuations and set - valuations of graphs .",

    "a graph @xmath2 which admits a set - labeling ( or set - indexer ) is called an _ set - labeled graph _ ( or _ set - indexed graph _ ) .",
    "further fundamental and consequent studies on set - valuations and set - indexers of graphs , can be seen in @xcite .",
    "the binary operation of set - labels used in @xcite , is the symmetric difference @xmath12 of sets .",
    "later , the notions of integer additive set - labeling and sumset labeling of graphs have been introduced in @xcite , by using sumset operation of sets instead of symmetric difference of sets , and studies on graphs which admit these types of set - labelings are appeared in subsequent literature .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to introduce another two types of set - valuations",
    ". in which the binary operations are union and intersection of sets . in these types of set - labelings",
    "the set labels of edges are the union or intersection of the set labels of their end vertices .",

    "the proof follows exactly as in the previous theorem .",
    "in this paper , the notions of two types of set - labeling of graphs have been introduced and certain properties and characteristics of graphs which admit these types of set - labels have been discussed .",
    "more problems in this area are still open .",
