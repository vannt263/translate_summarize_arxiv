    "the contribution from the @xmath77 state comes out [ fig . [ fig:3](a ) ] due to the finite fermi distribution function in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : density ] ) for @xmath84 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath80 increases in the core region as shown in fig . [ fig:3](b ) . at @xmath85 , which is larger than the energy of @xmath77 ,",
    "the electron density is almost uniform due to the contribution from the @xmath77 state .",
    "the vortex charge is then reduced strongly at high temperatures as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) .",
    "next we discuss the u - vortex .",
    "contrary to the c - vortex , the @xmath78 bound state in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) can contribute to the electron density at all temperatures , since this state is located at zero energy .",
    "as the consequence , the electron density for the u - vortex is almost uniform . in the u - vortex case we find very small temperature dependence in the electron density , since the @xmath78 state is located at zero energy and participates in the energy excitations with the same rate at all temperatures .",
    "we note that the electron density for the u - vortex is very similar to that for the c - vortex at @xmath85 , where the @xmath77 state is occupied .",
    "we conclude that the appearance of the vortex charge depends on the position of the @xmath75 bound state relative to the temperature . in the conventional @xmath2-wave case",
    ", the vortex charge always appears at sufficiently low temperatures , @xcite which is similar to the c - vortex result .",
    "let us mention the effect of charge screening .",
    "we show the total electron density @xmath79 and contribution from extended states @xmath81 for two cases , where charge screening is taken into account or not ( see fig . [ fig:4 ] ) . in the no charge screening case ,",
    "the contribution from extended states @xmath81 is small at the vortex core .",
    "the total electron density @xmath79 is then decreased , resulting in larger vortex charge .",
    "note that the scalar potential in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : bdg2]g ) is zero ( @xmath86 ) for no charge screening ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "therefore the scalar potential does not work to screen the vortex charge . on the other hand ,",
    "when the charge screening turns on , quasiparticles respond to the vortex charge via the scalar potential @xmath88 in the bdg equation ( [ eqn : bdg2]a)-([eqn : bdg2]c ) .",
    "@xmath81 is then increased to cancel the vortex charge . in contract to the extended state , electron density of the bound states @xmath80 does not exhibit difference between the charge screening and no screening cases . since the bound states are localized around the vortex core , their wave function hardly modulate , while the extended states do easily .",
    "hence the extended states quickly respond to the electric field and they screen the vortex charge .",
    "however , there still remains the substantial vortex charge .",
    "we discuss the effect of magnetic field .",
    "the chern - simons physics @xcite and bernoulli effect @xcite take place in the presence of magnetic field . to see this effect we compare the two results , where @xmath89 is present or ignored ( no magnetic field ) .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath88 is taken into account for both cases .",
    "our result shows that the effect of the magnetic field is too small to be seen .",
    "thus we find that the vortex charge is mainly determined by the microscopic quasiparticles structure , which reflects the phase winding of the chiral pairing .",
    "figure [ fig:5 ] shows a schematic picture of the energy spectrum of vortex bound states for various winding pairings .",
    "the lowest - lying state appears at the symmetric position of @xmath76 and @xmath90 due to the relation ( [ eqn : symmetry ] ) , where @xmath76 and @xmath90 are the angular momenta of @xmath25 and @xmath43 , respectively . for the c - vortex",
    "the bound state energy is positive for @xmath75 , while it is negative or zero for the u - vortex .",
    "therefore the c - vortex is always charged up at low temperatures , while the u - vortex is not .",
    "thus the vortex charge can be discussed in terms of the vortex bound states for all types of chiral pairings .",
    "similarly , we can understand that the @xmath2-wave ( zero winding ) vortex is charged up .",
    "@xcite    finally let us discuss non - chiral pairings , such as @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93-waves .",
    "these states are all gapless and it is reported that there is no bound states for the @xmath93-wave . @xcite",
    "since the system is anisotropic in this case , the energy eigenstates are not classified by the angular momentum .",
    "therefore the above argument for the vortex charging is difficult to apply to this case .",
    "however , our result implies that the detailed quasiparticle structure in the vortex core is important for the vortex charging effect even in the gapless pairing cases .",
    "in conclusion , we have solved the problem of a single @xmath0-wave vortex self - consistently within the bogoliubov - de gennes theory . the full self - consistent calculation including both charge and current screenings was performed for the first time to investigate vortex problems .",
    "due to the time reversal symmetry breaking , there are two types of vortices .",
    "we found a substantial vortex charge in the c - vortex case , while the vortex charge is suppressed for u - vortex .",
    "we conclude that the vortex charging effects are mainly determined by the local quasiparticle structure around the vortex core , reflecting the chiral @xmath0-wave paring .",
    "especially the lowest vortex bound state is very important for the charging effect at low temperatures .    in a real sample",
    "we can expect two types ( @xmath32 ) of domains .",
    "therefore we expect both c and u - vortices in the presence of an external magnetic field . in domains , where the c - vortex is realized , an electronic field",
    "is induced due to the vortex charge .",
    "therefore the charge of the c - vortex can be detected .",
    "if we use a field cooled sample , a single domain forming the u - vortex is realized all over the sample , since the u - vortex is energetically favorable .",
    "@xcite in this case it is difficult to find a signal from the u - vortex , since the charge of the u - vortex is much smaller than the c - vortex one .",
    "thus we can distinguish the two types of c and u - vortices .",

    "the vortex charge can induce lattice distortion and it scatters neutrons .",
    "it is reported that a polarized neutron scattering can be used to detect the vortex charge .",

    "<S> quasiparticle states around a single vortex in a @xmath0-wave superconductor are studied on the basis of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory , where both charge and current screenings are taken into account . due to the violation of time reversal symmetry , </S>",
    "<S> there are two types of vortices which are distinguished by their winding orientations relative to the angular momentum of the chiral cooper pair . </S>",
    "<S> the bdg solution shows that the charges of the two types of vortices are quite different , reflecting the rotating cooper pair of the @xmath0-wave paring state . </S>"
