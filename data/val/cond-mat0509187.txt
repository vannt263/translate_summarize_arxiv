    "the scaling limit of many two - dimensional critical lattice models and growth models encountered in statistical physics may be described in terms of fractals .",

    "stochastic loewner evolution @xcite ( also described as schramm - loewner evolution and abbreviated as sle ) is a rigorous mathematical tool for producing and studying stochastic conformally invariant curves in the plane ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for review ) .",
    "it was conjectured , therefore , that sle is a description of such statistical systems .",
    "in several special cases this conjecture has been rigorously proven .",
    "sle is based on the loewner equation taken from complex analysis @xcite .",
    "this equation contains a driving ( or forcing ) function , @xmath5 , which determines all the properties of sle .",
    "a few reasonable requirements constrain the choice of this function to a scaled brownian motion , which leaves only one free parameter .",
    "one of these requirements ( that the forcing function is continuous ) ensures that the curves produced by sle do not exhibit branching , thus leaving many systems , such as branching polymers , out of the picture . in this paper",
    ", we generalize sle by dropping the demand that the forcing stochastic function be continuous , but keeping the requirement of stationary and statistically - independent increments .",
    "this leads to a much broader class of forcing processes including , in particular , the so called lvy processes @xcite .",
    "this generalization might be a useful description of tree - like stochastic growth .",
    "standard sle has been studied in various geometries under the names of chordal , radial and other kinds of sle s . in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to the chordal situation ( growth in the upper half plane ) .",
    "we believe that our generalized sle in a radial geometry may be relevant for description of the diffusion - limited aggregation , and plan to study it in a separate publication .    in the next section ,",
    "we define and describe the problem , in terms of the parameters which define the forcing .",
    "the forcing includes both a scaled brownian motion and a stable lvy process .",
    "the parameters are @xmath0 , which sets the normalization of the brownian term , @xmath6 which sets the normalization of the lvy term , and @xmath1 which determines its shape .",
    "this qualitative section ends with numerical simulations of the traces , the geometrical structures generated by the sle .",
    "the final section of the paper gives the analysis of the short - distance properties of the traces showing both analytically and numerically that the traces have qualitative change in behavior as @xmath0 and @xmath1 each pass though critical values , respectively at four and one .",

    "the accompanying large - scale features ( which may be different for different geometries ) will be the subject of a subsequent paper .",
    "we point out that most of the statements about the behavior of objects related to sle and its generalizations are probabilistic , and typically appended by qualifiers `` almost surely '' or `` with probability one '' in mathematical literature .",

    "( [ sleu ] ) but maintain the functional composition property , we may only discard the requirement of continuity of the forcing @xmath5 but keep its increments to be stationary and statistically independent .",
    "this leads to a broad class of stochastic processes , including the so called lvy processes @xcite , also called lvy flights in physics literature @xcite .",

    "the noise realization for these two pictures is the same , multiplied by an appropriate @xmath0 .",
    "as is well known @xcite,@xcite , the trace does not touch itself for @xmath83 , but does so for @xmath84 .",
    "the figures show these contrasting behaviors .    for figures [ picm07][picm13 ] we approximate sle with lvy flights using the method in @xcite .",
    "as expected , these figures show branching structures produced by the discontinuous jumps .",
    "the figures suggest that a forcing consisting solely of discontinuous jumps does not produce any self - intersections .",
    "figures [ pick2m07][pick6m07 ] show the combined effects of jumps and brownian motion . exactly the same noise realizations have been used as in the previous four figures .",

    "the trace consists of branches which look like the ones produced by the loewner equation with constant forcing .",

    "it is well known @xcite that the standard brownian sle process is qualitatively different in its behavior in the three different intervals @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 . in the first interval the sle trace forms a fractal that neither touches itself nor the real line ( see figure [ pick2 ] ) . in the second interval",
    "the trace touches itself and the real line ( see figure [ pick6 ] ) . for large enough time it will touch down arbitrarily far from the origin . eventually it will surround and swallow up any point on the real line no matter how far it is from the origin . in the third , all points on the real line are surrounded sequentially , but also the trace fills in all the surrounded areas .",
    "this kind of behavior is not discussed here .",
    "the different behaviors for different values of @xmath0 are described as different phases of sle , basically because the behavior in each interval is qualitatively different from that in the others .",
    "the difference is topological in character .",
    "it can be seen in both the small- and the large - scale features of the trace . here",
    "we shall discuss phases of the model containing both brownian and lvy forcing , but concentrate mostly on small - scale features of touching and near - touching .",
    "notice that the events when the trace touches the real line and the previously existing parts of itself , are equivalent in the statistical sense , which follows from the stationary increments of the forcing and the composition property of conformal maps .",
    "since the driving force @xmath5 is stationary and sle is defined by a first - order differential equation , we have the statistical identity @xmath100 consider the trace grown up to a time @xmath101 .",
    "the part of the trace that developed earlier ( up to time @xmath102 ) can be mapped to the real axis by @xmath103 .",
    "then the event of the growing hull swallowing ( or coming arbitrarily close to swallowing ) a point somewhere on its previously grown boundary is statistically equivalent to the event of the hull swallowing ( or almost swallowing ) a point on the real axis , and the probabilities of such events should be the same .",
    "therefore , to determine the probability of swallowing for points anywhere on the boundary of the hull , it is enough to determine the probability of swallowing only for the points on the real axis .",
    "this was initially argued for purely brownian sle , and remains valid here .",
    "the main tool that we will use to determine phase transitions in sle is dynkin s formula @xcite .",
    "it can be written for a generic stochastic process ( not necessarily lvy ) , but we will restrict it to lvy processes and stochastic integrals of them , that is , processes @xmath104 defined by a langevin - like equation @xmath105 with any drift function @xmath106 .",

    "note that we may solve ( [ zero mode ] ) with any boundary condition : any non - constant solution is sufficient . in the brownian case",
    "this equation is differential and easy to solve .",
