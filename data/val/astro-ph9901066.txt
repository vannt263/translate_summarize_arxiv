    "a study of the spectral evolution of a radiation field caused by compton scattering on an electron gas was first published by kompaneets .",
    "he obtained the kinetic equation describing the evolution of an isotropic and homogenous radiation field in an infinite , homogenous , thermal and nearly nonrelativistic electron gas .",
    "the kompaneets equation was later extended to include a non - homogenous radiation field in a plane parallel atmosphere @xcite .",
    "more recently the extension to arbitrarily high orders in frequency and temperature has been discussed @xcite .    compton scattering of polarized radiation was studied by chandrasekhar in the zero temperature limit . stark attempted to extend this work to nonzero temperatures .",
    "he obtained radiative transfer equations for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 stokes parameters for low frequency radiation scattered on a hot , nearly nonrelativistic thermal electron gas , including induced scattering and assuming an axisymmetric radiation field .",
    "the equations were derived by expanding to first order in @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is photon energy , @xmath5 is thermal energy and @xmath6 is the electron rest energy .",
    "the fully relativistic equations for all four stokes parameters were obtained by nagirner and poutanen and further extended to include induced scattering by nagirner .",
    "these equations are very complicated and hard to use in practice .",
    "therefore , when working with low frequencies and electron velocities , a simplified form is preferred .",
    "nagirner did also reduce the fully relativistic equations in this limit , to the same order as stark .    however , when the simplified equations of nagirner are integrated assuming an axisymmetric field , the result is very different from the equations obtained by stark .",
    "the two sets of equations are supposed to describe the same phenomenon , but several terms disagree .",
    "to make the situation even more confusing , the equations in the russian original paper by nagirner are different from those in the english translation @xcite . as we show in this paper , the reason for the disagreements is that some relativistic corrections to the rotation angles between different polarization bases were neglected by stark .",
    "some small integration errors in both papers also contribute to the differences .",
    "in this paper we present the correct radiative transfer equations for polarized radiation in an electron gas to first order in @xmath3 and @xmath2 [ equation ( [ eq : boltzmann3 ] ) ] .",
    "the equations are derived from the boltzmann collisional equation .",
    "the special case of an axisymmetric field is considered [ equations ( [ eq : i ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) ] .",
    "we then extend the equations to include a moving electron gas , to second order in gas velocity [ equation ( [ eq : complete ] ) ] .",
    "the transfer equations for compton scattering of low frequency radiation on a relatively hot electron gas is of high importance in cosmology .",
    "clusters of galaxies contain a hot electron gas , and the cosmic background radiation is changed because of compton scattering on this gas .",
    "this is the so called sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sz effect ) @xcite .",
    "this effect together with x - ray data of clusters of galaxies is used e.g. to measure the hubble constant . the sz - effect for a moving electron gas @xcite",
    "can be used to measure peculiar velocities of clusters .",
    "such measurements have so far only used the intensity of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) .",
    "upcoming satellite experiments like _ map _ and _ planck _ will try to measure polarization in the cbr . therefore the equations describing the change in the stokes parameters of the cbr caused by compton scattering in clusters [ equations ( [ eq : boltzmann3 ] ) and ( [ eq : complete ] ) in this paper ] will be important .",
    "we investigate if there is any temperature or velocity dependent polarization produced .",
    "we also briefly discuss scattering of radiation from extended radio sources in the cluster on the intracluster gas and possible polarization produced from this effect .    here",
    "we derive the radiative transfer equations , starting in section [ sect : restframe ] with the boltzmann collisional equations in the rest frame of an electron . using lorentz transformations",
    ", we transform the equations to the rest frame of the electron gas , and then expand to second order in electron velocity and first order in @xmath3 , before averaging over electron velocities ( section [ sect : integration ] ) .",
    "the final result is presented in equation ( [ eq : boltzmann3 ] ) .",
    "we use different bases for the stokes vector in the electron rest frame and in the rest frame of the gas .",
    "in section [ sect : bases ] we discuss the transformation between these two bases . in section [",
    "sect : symmetry ] , the equations are integrated in the case of an axisymmetric field to compare with the equations of stark [ equations ( [ eq : i ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) ] .",
    "then , in section [ sect : moving ] , equation ( [ eq : boltzmann3 ] ) is extended to a moving electron gas .",
    "we derive the radiative transfer equations to second order in gas velocity [ equation ( [ eq : complete ] ) ] .",
    "finally , applications of the formalism deduced in the previous sections to the sz effect is discussed in section [ sect : sz ] . in the conclusions ,",
    "we discuss the flaws in the previously published results . throughout this paper , the relativistic quantum system of units , in which the electron mass , speed of light and planck s constant are given by @xmath7 ,",
    "in this section , we study the evolution of a beam of polarized radiation in the ` system frame ' , in which the mean momentum of the electrons in the gas is zero . in this frame we introduce a fixed coordinate system @xmath8 with arbitrary directions of the axes . a photon beam in the direction",
    "@xmath9 ( see fig . [",

    "[ fig : photonco ] ] and @xmath21 is an infinitesimal solid angle .",
    "the direction unit vector @xmath22 gives the direction of the photon beam and @xmath23 is the angle between two photons which have angles @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the electron velocity @xmath17 .",
    "the boltzmann collisional equation describes the change of @xmath26 caused by scattering on particles with velocity @xmath27 @xcite . in the rest frame",
    "the equation takes the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number of photons per phase space volume scattered into the beam @xmath31 and out of it , respectively from each scattering . assuming an isotropic electron gas , the number of electrons with velocity @xmath27 is given by the electron distribution function @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the electron density in the rest frame .",
    "next , we assume that the distribution function can be written as @xmath34 , which in the system frame is @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is normalised as @xmath37 .",
    "going to the system frame , using the lorentz transformations [ equation ( [ eq : lorentz ] ) ] above , we find that @xmath38    the rate of scattering from one photon beam @xmath39 into @xmath31 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the scattering matrix in the rest frame , given by @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45    the klein - nishina cross section @xmath46 is given by @xmath47,\\ ] ]    where @xmath48 is the thompson cross section . the matrices transform between different polarization bases as discussed in the next section .",
    "the more photons there are in the state @xmath31 , the more likely it is that photons are scattered into this state .",
    "this fact ( induced scattering ) is included by the factor @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is given by @xcite @xmath51 the incoming and outgoing frequencies are related by the usual formula for the compton frequency shift , @xmath52 the rate of scattering out of the beam @xmath31 is @xcite @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "note that the spontanous scattering term ( the first term on the right hand side ) in this equation contains the klein - nishina cross section and * not * the scattering matrix .",
    "this is because of the isotropy of the medium @xcite .",
    "the cross section @xmath55 and the scattering matrix @xmath56 are given by equation ( [ eq : r ] ) and ( [ eq : rm ] ) , except that @xmath57 and @xmath58 are replaced by @xmath59 and @xmath57 respectively .",

    "so far , the polarization vector basis has not been considered .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath43 describes the scattering of photons @xmath65 in a certain polarization basis which we call the ` scattering basis ' .",
    "this basis is dependent on the photons and electrons involved in each scattering event @xcite , and is therefore unconvenient when considering several scatterings .",
    "we wish to describe the polarization relative to the fixed set of axes @xmath8 in the system frame .",
    "when we use the vector @xmath66 in this frame , we use a polarization basis which we call the ` system basis ' . in this basis , the stokes parameters are measured relative to the meridian planes . the matrix @xmath67 rotates the vector @xmath66 from the system basis to the scattering basis , so that the matrix @xmath43 can be applied .",
    "then @xmath68 rotates back to the system basis @xcite .",
    "a stokes vector can be rotated from one basis to another with the rotation matrix @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the rotation angle of the polarization basis vectors . using the notation of chandrasekhar",
    ", we write @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the rotation angles in the rest frame of the electron . these angles must be transformed to the system frame and expanded to second order in electron velocity .",
    "we wish to express @xmath74 and @xmath75 in terms of the zeroth order rotation angles @xmath76 and @xmath77 used by chandrasekhar .",
    "we separate the factors which are dependent on electron directions ( which we call @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) from @xmath76 and @xmath77 which are not .",
    "this enables us , as will be shown in the next section , to collect all dependency on electron directions ( which we average over ) in one matrix , making the integration in section [ sect : integration ] easier .",
    "the lorentz transformed rotation angles are given by @xcite : @xmath80 here the following definitions were used : @xmath81 where @xmath25 is the angle between the photon @xmath82 and the electron velocity @xmath17 .",

    "the angles @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the zeroth order rotation angles given by chandrasekhar , @xmath84",
    "the next step is to average over alle possible electron directions by integrating the right side of equation ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) over @xmath85 from @xmath86 to @xmath87 and @xmath88 from @xmath86 to @xmath89 and divide by @xmath89 . before integrating ,",
    "all terms are expanded to second order in @xmath27 and first order in @xmath11 .",
    "expanding to second order in @xmath27 is equivalent to first order in @xmath2 when using a maxwellian distribution function for the electrons .",
    "we expand @xmath90 and @xmath91 near @xmath92 and @xmath93 : @xmath94 where we redefine @xmath95 . using the lorentz transformation equations ( [ eq : lorentz ] ) , @xmath96 and @xmath97",

    "the quantities @xmath99 and @xmath100 are expanded instead of @xmath78 and @xmath79 for reasons which will become obvious .",
    "the rotation matrices @xmath68 and @xmath67 contain cosine and sine of the angles @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",

    "the matrices are now independent of electron directions , so they can be treated as constants in the integration .",
    "next , we insert the expanded expressions into equation ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) and use the relation ( which can be found from geometric considerations ) @xmath108 finally , @xmath109 is used to integrate over @xmath88 and @xmath85 .",
    "then we average over velocities , using a non relativistic maxwellian distribution , @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath112 is the temperature of the gas . remembering that @xmath113 and @xmath114 where @xmath115 we find that @xmath116\\nonumber\\\\    & & -2\\tau{\\mbox{$\\mathbfss{l}$}}(\\pi - i_2){\\mbox{$\\mathbfss{c}$}}{\\mbox{$\\mathbfss{l}$}}(-i_1){\\tilde{n}}'\\nonumber\\\\   & & + 2(1-\\mu)\\nu{\\mbox{$\\mathbfss{n}$}}{\\mbox{$\\mathbfss{l}$}}(\\pi - i_2){\\mbox{$\\mathbfss{b}$}}{\\mbox{$\\mathbfss{l}$}}(-i_1)\\biggl[2{\\tilde{n}}'+ \\nu\\left({\\frac{\\partial { \\tilde{n}}'}{\\partial \\nu}}\\right)\\biggr]\\biggr\\}d\\omega',\\nonumber\\\\   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath117 and @xmath118 matrices are defined in appendix [ app : matrices ] .",
    "these are the radiative transfer equations for all four stokes parameters in a rather hot thermal isotropic electron gas ( first order in @xmath2 ) for low frequency ( first order in @xmath3 ) radiation in the rest frame of the electron gas . if the equation for the i - stokes parameter is integrated assuming no dependency on angles in the radiation field @xmath66 ( isotropic radiation field ) we recover the kompaneets equation @xcite .",
    "now the field @xmath66 is assumed homogenous and symmetric about the @xmath119-axis , so there is no @xmath120 dependence . with this symmetry , there is no @xmath121-polarization , so only the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the stokes vector are considered .",

    "in sections [ sect : bases ] and [ sect : integration ] we transformed the boltzmann collisional equations from the rest frame of the electron [ equation ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) ] to the rest frame of the electron gas .",
    "now we obtain the equations in a frame of reference where the electron gas is moving . in this frame",
    "the electrons have a common nonzero mean velocity .",
    "therefore , we now have to make a transformation from the rest frame of the electron to a frame where the electron has a velocity which is a sum of the thermal velocity ( the velocity in the rest frame of the electron gas ) and the velocity of the gas .",
    "we expand to second order in thermal velocity ( @xmath27 ) and electron gas velocity ( @xmath138 ) . to this order ,",
    "relativistic addition of velocities reduces to @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the total electron velocity observed from the moving frame , @xmath17 is the velocity in the rest frame of the gas ( thermal velocity ) and @xmath141 is the velocity of the gas observed in the moving frame . using spherical coordinates , we add each of the components to get @xmath142 where @xmath143 , @xmath144 . here",
    "@xmath145 are the angles between the total velocity vector and the photon , @xmath20 are the angles between the electron velocity and the photon in the rest frame of the gas and @xmath146 are the angles between the gas velocity and the photon .",
    "we follow the same steps that we used to obtain the equations in the rest frame of the electron gas .",
    "the difference is that we now transform to a frame where the electron velocity is @xmath139 instad of @xmath17 .",
    "so , in equation ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) and in the expanded quantities [ equation ( [ eq : expanded ] ) ] , we have to make the following replacements [ using equations ( [ eq : addvel ] ) ] : @xmath147 where @xmath148 . making these replacements",
    ", we write the right hand side of equation ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) as @xmath149 where the f - functions are just collections of terms proportional to different orders of @xmath27 .",
    "when averaging over electron velocities , the term @xmath150 disappears since @xmath151 by definition .",
    "this is important , because the terms that are left are just a sum of terms dependent on gas velocity ( @xmath152 ) and terms dependent on thermal velocity ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "there are no cross terms dependent on both !",
    "so in the radiative transfer equations for a moving electron gas , the part dependent on temperature ( thermal velocity ) and the part dependent on gas velocity are independent .",
    "this simplifies the calculations since one can calculate the terms dependent on thermal velocity and the terms dependent on gas velocity separately .",
    "the terms containing the gas temperature can be found assuming that the gas velocity is zero , and similarly the terms dependent on gas velocity can be found assuming that the temperature is zero .",
    "then the different terms can be added to get the complete radiative transfer equations for a moving electron gas with nonzero temperature .",
    "we now find the terms dependent on gas velocity assuming the temperature to be zero .",
    "going back to the boltzmann collisional equation in the rest frame of an electron [ equations ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) ] , one has to transform all quantities to the frame of reference where the electron has a velocity @xmath141 .",
    "this is exactly what was done previously , except that one has to replace @xmath154 with @xmath155 in all the expressions and expansions used , since the only velocity now is the gas velocity .",
    "since there is no averaging over electron velocities and directions this time ( the electron gas has a constant velocity which all the electrons are following ) , one can change to a coordinate system in which the expressions and calculations are more easy .",
    "previously , a coordinate system @xmath8 with arbitrary axes was introduced .",
    "the incoming and outgoing photon directions were described with polar and azimuthal angles @xmath156 and @xmath157 with respect to this coordinate system .",
    "but since the directions of the axes were arbitrary , one can chose the @xmath119-axis to be in the direction of the gas velocity . with this choice of @xmath119-axis , the angle @xmath158 between the @xmath119-axis and",
    "the photon is just the angle @xmath148 between the photon and electron .",
    "the azimuthal angles are still called @xmath120 and @xmath159 for the photons with frequency @xmath11 , and @xmath160 . with this choice of axes ,",
    "the change @xmath161 and @xmath162 is made everywhere in the equations .",
    "the correction factors @xmath163 and @xmath164 from the lorentz transformations of the angles @xmath76 and @xmath77 need special attention .",
    "these are expressed ( see appendix [ app : expansions ] ) through the angle @xmath88 .",
    "that was a convenient angle when there was an integration over electron directions .",
    "now however , there is only an integration over incoming photon directions ( note that @xmath165 with the current choice of axes ) , so the angle @xmath166 is a better choice than @xmath88 .",
    "the following relations between @xmath88 and @xmath166 can be found from geometrical considerations : @xmath167    since there is no integration over electron velocities , it is now easy to find the equations describing the radiative transfer of polarized radiation in a moving zero temperature electron gas .",
    "all that is necessary is to put the expanded lorentz transformed quantities ( appendix [ app : expansions ] ) into the boltzmann equation ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) , and replace @xmath168 in the way described above .",

    "this time @xmath184 is not isotropic since the radiation is only coming from some angles .",
    "a more detalied study is necessary to determine if the change of polarization of radiation from a radio source can be used to determine density and temperature of the cluster gas .",
    "finally we consider the kinematic sz effect which is the change of the background radiation because of scattering on a moving cluster gas .",
    "this time we assume that the temperature of the gas is zero . again",
    ", using equation ( [ eq : complete ] ) , we find to first order in optical depth using an initial planck function : @xmath188 where @xmath189 .",
    "the first equation is just the formula for the kinematic sz effect which was given by sunyaev & zeldovich without derivation .",
    "the second equation shows that some polarization is produced from the kinematic effect .",
    "the degree of polarization is proportional to the tangential velocity component of the cluster .",
    "this result was also given by sunyaev & zeldovich , again without deductions .",
    "the second result can be used to determine the tangential velocity of clusters of galaxies , but at the moment the polarization degree produced ( about @xmath190 is too small to be observed .",
    "in equations ( [ eq : boltzmann3 ] ) we have obtained the radiative transfer equations for the stokes parameters to first order in @xmath3 and @xmath2 . comparing these to those obtained by nagirner , some small differences are seen . comparing the radiative transfer equations for an axisymmetric field [ equations ( [ eq : i ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) ] with those obtained by stark , we find several disagreements . however , setting @xmath191 , studying only the intensity of radiation , the equations actually agree .",
    "this indicates that the difference has to do with polarization , and indeed , in the paper of stark , we find that the zeroth order rotation angles @xmath76 and @xmath77 were used instead of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the relativistic corrections to these angles were neglected , which , as is seen from the taylor expansion , is altering the integration substantially . including these corrections , the equations in the paper of stark become identical to those obtained here [ equations ( [ eq : i ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) ] , except for the induced scattering terms . by carefully performing the last integration in that paper , we find that the induced scattering terms also agree with what we have derived here .    manipulating the equations in the paper of nagirner before integration , it is possible to show that they agree with equation ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) of this paper .",
    "so there has to be an error somewhere in his integration . and",
    "indeed , by correcting the misprints in the integration , we find full agreement with the results presented here .",
    "so our equations ( [ eq : boltzmann3 ] ) correct the errors of stark and nagirner .",
    "we also transformed the equations to a frame where the electron gas is moving [ equations ( [ eq : complete ] ) ] . in this frame",
    "the equations were derived to second order in gas velocity .",
    "the transfer equations were tested by showing that they give zero polarization produced from the thermal sz effect to first order in optical depth .",
    "we also showed that polarization from the kinematic sz effect is very small.the formalism developed here can probably be used to study polarization of radiation from radio sources in the cluster upon scattering with the intracluster medium .",
    "we thank mark birkinshaw for suggesting the study of polarization in the sz - effect and juri poutanen for help and comments .",
    "we also thank the research council of norway for a travel grant .",
