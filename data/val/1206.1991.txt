    "at asymptotically high temperature ( @xmath4 ) strongly interacting matter , described by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , behaves like an almost free gas of quarks and gluons .",
    "excitations of the medium in this temperature range are well described by dispersion relations of free quarks and gluons .",
    "as @xmath4 is lowered , the temperature - dependent running coupling constant , @xmath5 , increases and the excitation spectra of the elementary quark and gluon fields are modified .",
    "eventually they deviate substantially from those of free particles .",
    "in particular at those low temperatures close but above the qcd phase transition , @xmath0 , at which experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite found evidence for the existence of strong correlations in hot and dense matter , it is of interest to understand the fate of the elementary excitations , their quasi - particle properties and the structure of dispersion relations .",
    "> from leading - order resummed perturbation theory it is known that collective excitations of the quark and gluon fields acquire mass gaps ( thermal masses ) and decay rates proportional to @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively @xcite . since at leading order the decay rates in units of @xmath4 parametrically grow faster than the thermal masses as @xmath4 is lowered , it is navely expected that quasi - particle modes of these fields cease to exist at low temperatures at which @xmath5 is large , even in the deconfined phase . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimentally observed quark number scaling of elliptic flow suggests the existence of quasi - particles having quark quantum numbers at the early stage of fireballs created in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "also the behavior of quark number susceptibilities and higher - order cumulants of quark number fluctuations , calculated in lattice qcd , suggests the existence of quasi - particles even near @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "one of the striking features of the quasi - particle excitations of quarks , found in leading order perturbation theory , is that the in - medium quark dispersion relation splits into two branches , the normal and plasmino modes @xcite .",
    "moreover , the latter has a non - trivial minimum at non - vanishing momentum of order @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "such a spectrum of fermions is , in fact , quite common . in the weak coupling and high @xmath4 limit it",
    "is realized not only for qcd , but also in a wide class of models where the fermion couples to a boson .",
    "away from this limiting situation the fermion spectrum has been investigated in various theoretical settings @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation made in these studies is that the fermion spectrum exhibits a variety of structures depending on parameters of the system .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out that the fermion spectrum has a multi - peak structure when the mass of bosons that couple to the fermion is comparable with @xmath4 @xcite : in addition to the normal and plasmino peaks having thermal masses , there appears an additional , third dispersion which crosses the origin of the energy - momentum plane .",
    "the existence of such a multi - peak structure is also suggested in refs .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate the fate of this third branch in the quark spectrum in the non - perturbative region near but above @xmath0 .    in order to gain insight into the quasi - particle nature of quarks in the non - perturbative region ,",
    "analyses of the spectral properties of quarks have recently been carried out on the lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations , performed in the quenched approximation of qcd in landau gauge @xcite for @xmath8 , indicated that a plasmino mode with a distinctively different dispersion relation contributes to the quark spectral function in addition to the normal mode even at temperatures close to @xmath0 . in the chiral limit",
    "these modes have identical quasi - particle masses that are , in the range of temperature analyzed , approximately proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "it is notable that similar results have been reported in the analysis of the quark spectrum with schwinger - dyson equations @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd calculations presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , showed that the quasi - particle masses and dispersion relations of quarks are quite sensitive to finite volume ( @xmath9 ) effects .",
    "the quark thermal mass drops as the aspect ratio @xmath10 increases , and it does not converge at the value on the largest lattice in refs .",
    "@xcite with @xmath11 , while the lattice spacing @xmath12 used in these studies was found to be fine enough to suppress lattice discretization effects .",
    "the origin of such a strong @xmath9 dependence is well understood in terms of discretization effects in momentum space . for @xmath11",

    ", we use the two - pole ansatz as in the previous studies @xcite .",
    "we show that this ansatz reproduces the lattice correlator well on the largest lattice over rather wide ranges of bare quark masses and momenta .",
    "we use the new large volume results to improve the extrapolation of the thermal quark mass values to the infinite volume limit . we obtain a value which is about @xmath16 smaller in magnitude than the one obtained in the earlier analysis",
    ". the large spatial volume also allows one to directly analyze the momentum dependence of excitation spectra in more detail .",
    "we show that the dispersion relation for the plasmino mode obtained with the two - pole ansatz has a minimum at non - zero momentum .",
    "to clarify physical consequences for the quark spectral function that can be extracted from the analysis with the two - pole ansatz , we also take a closer look at the euclidean quark correlator on the lattice .",
    "we show that with the present statistics the two - pole ansatz can give small @xmath17 even if the quark spectral function does not consist solely of two peaks .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that the analysis performed by us for finite ranges of parameters indicates the existence of quasi - particle peaks corresponding to the normal and plasmino modes having thermal masses near but above @xmath0 .    at @xmath1",
    ", we find that on about half of the gauge configurations the quark correlator shows an enhancement deviating from the generic behavior near the chiral limit .",
    "we show that this behavior is sensitive to the chirality of the quark propagator and argue that it is expected to arise from gauge configurations with non - trivial topology which are still abundant at this value of the temperature .",

    "we note that a similar result is obtained from the analysis of the quark spectrum in the schwinger - dyson approach @xcite .",
    "the decrease of @xmath24 for large momentum shows that the plasmino mode ceases to exist as @xmath42 becomes larger .    at asymptotically high temperatures the quark spectrum",

    "it also suggests that in our current analysis the normal mode is quantitatively much better under control than the plasmino branch .",
    "nonetheless , some qualitative features on the quark spectrum can be extracted from our results .",

    "next , the momentum dependences of the peak positions in @xmath51 can be constrained by general properties of the spectral function . using the relation eq .",

    "<S> temporal quark correlation functions are analyzed in quenched lattice qcd for two values of temperature above the critical temperature ( @xmath0 ) for deconfinement , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> a two - pole ansatz for the quark spectral function is used to determine the bare quark mass and the momentum dependence of excitation spectra on large lattices of size up to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the quark correlator on these parameters as well as the finite volume dependence of the excitation energies are analyzed in detail in order to examine the reliability of our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest the existence of quasi - particle peaks in the quark spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore find evidence that the dispersion relation of the plasmino mode has a minimum at non - zero momentum even in the non - perturbative region near @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also elaborate on the enhancement of the quark correlator near the chiral limit which is observed at @xmath1 on about half of the gauge configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this to the presence of near zero - modes of the fermion matrix that are associated with non - trivial topology of the gauge configurations . </S>"
