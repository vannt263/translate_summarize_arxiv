    "multipactoring and the ece have been detrimental to the functioning of onboard space devices as well as klystrons and accelerators . in the latter ,",
    "the ece was characterized and dealt with at the cern isr ( intersecting storage rings ) @xcite . with the construction of high current colliders ,",
    "e.g. , the b factories , or accelerators producing a high amount of photons per ( e@xmath0 , h@xmath0 ) bunch , multipacting and the ece are again being studied extensively @xcite .",
    "methods to suppress multipacting or the formation of electron cloud ( ec ) are still similar to the ones used for radio frequency ( rf ) components .",
    "one can allow the secondary electron to be produced and then get rid of them afterwards .",
    "for example by the use of electron clearing electrodes or , by use of low magnetic field solenoids that return the secondary electrons to the surfaces from which they have been produced .",
    "when photons are responsible for the creation of the ec , it is also possible to confine the photoelectrons to a place which is non - detrimental to the accelerator , for example in an ante - chamber .",
    "finally , one may modify the surface to produce less than one secondary electron per incident electron .",
    "this can be done , for example , by using a rough surface , by using an emission suppressing coating , or by cleaning the surface in - situ ( thermal treatment , plasma glow discharge etc ... ) to remove high sey adsorbed gas and oxide layers .",
    "these remedies can also be mixed together to give the best results for solving the problem in an existing machine or to be applied in a forthcoming accelerator where the ece problem is expected to occur .",
    "of course , lowering the circulating beam intensity can retard cloud formation but that also affects luminosity . in this summary ,",
    "we report sey measurements obtained at slac on flat surfaces , aluminium , tin , tizrv non evaporable getter ( neg ) and ticn .",
    "the system used to measure the sey is shown in fig.[figsketchsetup ] . the experimental methodology used to measure",
    "the secondary electron yield has been described in @xcite    1 analysis chamber - 2 loadlock chamber    3 sample plate entry - 4 sample transfer plate    5 rack and pinion travel - 6 sample plate stage    7 xyz@xmath1 omniax@xmath2 manipulator - 8 sample on xyz@xmath1    9 electrostatic energy analyzer - 10 x - ray source    11 sey / sem electron gun - 12 microfocus ion gun    13 sputter ion gun - 14 to pressure gauges and rga    15 to vacuum pumps - 16 gate valve    the sey ( @xmath3 ) definition is the number of electrons leaving the surface over the number of incident electrons ( primary electrons ) , which becomes @xmath4 . with @xmath5 the primary electrons and @xmath6 the total sample current being the difference between the primary and secondary electron current .",
    "a natural method for reducing the sey of a material is thermal heating .",
    "usually this is achieved during an in - situ bakeout . however , to be efficient the bake should be above 150@xmath7c .",
    "nevertheless , any increase of surface temperature has an effect on the sey @xcite . on some materials like cu or ag , certain oxides have an sey below that of the atomically clean metal .",
    "hence , growing an in - situ oxide by heating the surface , in presence of oxygen , is also a possibility @xcite .",
    "many examples can be found in the literature , and an excellent summary is available @xcite .",
    "another way of processing a surface to lower its sey is to expose it to energetic particles : photons , electrons or ions .",
    "usually the sey of metals obtained after exposure to energetic particles is close to that of an atomically clean surface .",
    "this trend seems also not to be observed in the case of exposure to very energetic ions , mev range per nucleons @xcite .    in the laboratory",
    "we have quantified the reduction of the sey as a function of electron or ion bombardment . by ion bombardment we mean an ion beam , not a plasma glow discharge .",
    "a plasma glow discharge is very effective in cleaning the surface in a few minutes , but plasma gas pressure required for a stable discharge is above a mtorr @xcite .",
    "moreover , performing an in - situ glow discharge of in an accelerator vacuum beam pipe is far from trivial .",
    "tin and activated tizrv getter coatings are good candidates for suppressing the ece .",
    "tin coating is known to have a sey max ( @xmath8 ) below or close to 1 when freshly deposited @xcite . however",
    ", when the `` as - deposited '' film is exposed to air , its sey maximum varies between 1.5 to 2.7 @xcite .",
    "sputtering of air exposed tin by ar@xmath0 ions or exposing it to a high dose of electrons will return @xmath8 to around 1 @xcite .    in the ece",
    "the energy gain of the secondary electrons is typically lower than 300  ev . in the case of the international linear collider ( ilc )",
    "positron damping ring , the average energy was computed to be 130 ev @xcite .",
    "the effect of 130  ev electron conditioning on the sey and @xmath8 are shown in fig.[figseylblall ] and [ figseymaxelectron ] , respectively .",
    "it can be seen that after a surface has been cleaned by a bake ( fig.[figseylblall ] ) or by electron conditioning the sey will increase even when the surface is left under a good vacuum ( 5.10@xmath9 torr ) , fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] .",
    "any scrubbed or `` clean '' surface will adsorb molecules from the residual gas .",
    "the increase of the sey is linked to the oxidation of the surface by the presence of oxygen atoms in these molecules .",
    "this was directly verified by observing the evolution of the xps ( x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ) carbon spectrum of tizrv during exposure to residual gas @xcite .    during the passage of the circulating positron beam",
    ", ions will be created from the residual gas .",
    "their energy , for the ilc damping rings , is less than 200  ev .",
    "bombardment from these ions can also contribute to sey reduction . to probe this effect ,",
    "we have submitted three surfaces to ion bombardment .",
    "the results are summarized in table.[tabseyiondose ] .",
    "the experimental parameters are described in @xcite .",
    "energy@xmath10 & dose @xmath11 + ticn & h@xmath12 & 1.29 & 280 & 1.11 + tin & n@xmath12 & 1.09 & 260 & 3.39 + tizrv & n@xmath12 & 1.15 & 300 & 2.29 +    [ tabseyiondose ]    comparing the effect of conditioning to tin , a gas - saturated tizrv neg was conditioned with a 130  ev electron beam , fig.[figseymaxelectron ] , and to a 250  ev ion beam , table.[tabseyiondose ] .",
    "an n@xmath13 ion dose of 0.96  @xmath14c / mm@xmath15 reduces @xmath8 from 1.45 to 1.18 , further exposure up to 2.29  @xmath14c / mm@xmath15 , causes only a @xmath8 decrease from 1.18 to 1.15 @xcite .",
    "aluminium is one of the common metal used in fabricating the accelerator vacuum chambers .",
    "the sey of atomically clean al ranks among the best material with a @xmath8 around 1 .",
    "clean al is extremely reactive to oxygen , however , upon air exposure , it will form a thick oxide with a @xmath8 well above 2 @xcite . as discussed earlier",
    ", electron conditioning will bring the @xmath8 of the metal to its atomically clean value .",
    "we repeated that measurement with oxidized aluminium . in the laboratory , we conditioned three different air - exposed technical aluminium surfaces and observed that the sey decreases at first and then re - increases .",
    "results shown in fig.[figseyalu ] are similar for the two other samples @xcite .    during conditioning the xps spectra",
    "show the c1s peak shifting toward lower binding energy ( be ) ) , signaling reduction of the oxide surface . with further conditioning ,",
    "the trend stops and the peak broadens .",
    "atomically clean al shows one peak at 73  ev ( metallic ) and another , al@xmath12o@xmath16 , at 76  ev .",
    "two of our samples show this double peak structure .",
    "thus , during conditioning , the peaks evolve from oxide to clean al and then reverse again .",
    "the third sample was extremely oxidized but , again , the broad peak shifted to lower be and then broadened further , consistent with the other samples @xcite .",
    "activated getter surfaces @xcite , like st707@xmath17 , tizr and tizrv have a @xmath8 below 1.3 @xcite .",
    "they also provide linearly - distributed pumping capacity .",
    "the main interest in tizrv coating over the other neg alloys is that its activation temperature is lowest , 180@xmath7c @xcite . during residual gas pumping the sey of neg increases ( fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] ) , just as it does for initially - clean tin .",
    "the sey increase of neg was followed with xps measurement by monitoring the evolution of the carbon peak @xcite .",
    "significantly , during residual gas atmosphere saturation of neg , the @xmath8 exceeds 1.3 , the maximum value obtained when saturating neg with individual common residual gases present in an accelerator environment @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is seen for a freshly activated neg as well as from a 11.2  mc / mm@xmath15 electron conditioned surface , fig.[figseymaxvacuum ] .",
    "this suggests that fast saturation by a single species is different from slow saturation by multiple species , i.e. , that time may play a role or co - adsorption of multiple species , may enhance the surface oxidation mechanism , as it can be seen in some surfaces @xcite .",
    "the residual gas composition of a baked uhv is mainly composed of h@xmath12 which readily diffuses into the neg , co , co@xmath12 , h@xmath12o , and ch@xmath18 which is negligibly - pumped by tizrv @xcite .",
    "the co - adsorption of the three oxidizing species enhances oxidation , similar to an air - oxidation , compared to oxides formed by dosing with a single specie .",
    "thicker surface oxide has generally higher sey .",
    "the process involved in building this thick oxide might be somewhat equivalent to cryogenic co - adsorption @xcite .",
    "it is planned to test this hypothesis in our setup .",
    "we have investigated a series of flat surface materials for suppressing the ece .",
    "the most promising remedies are ti - based coatings .",
    "tin has historically been the choice for successfully reducing multipacting . upon conditioning exposure to low energy ions or electrons ,",
    "its atmosphere - oxidized surface @xmath8 returns to 1 .",
    "ticn was developed as an oxidation - resistant replacement for tin ; however , it behaves similarly to tin .",
    "another coating option is low temperature activated neg , tizrv . following an activating - bake",
    ", its @xmath8 is 1.2 . as a bonus ,",
    "neg coating provides distributed beam chamber wall pumping . while pumping toward film gas saturation , the @xmath8 increases . to return the sey to low value and restore the pumping capacity ,",
    "the film can be thermally re - activated multiple times .",
    "the sey of the surface itself may also be restored by electron or ion bombardment , which will also recreate some surface pumping capacity .",
    "technical al surfaces were investigated under electron exposure .",
    "we found that @xmath8 will not go consistently below 1.8 .",
    "however , the behaviour at very large doses , above 3.10@xmath19  @xmath20 , was not measured .",
    "the sey may increase further , stabilize or oscillate .    in an accelerator environment ,",
    "synchrotron radiation , ions and electrons not only desorb molecules but also produce electrons which can lead to the formation of the ec .",
    "as we have seen , electron exposure is very efficient in reducing the sey .",
    "however , as the ec conditions the surface , the number of secondary electrons diminishes , hence the ec can oscillate between being on or off .",
    "nevertheless , photons and ions directly created by the beam may ensure that an ec does not develop , but only direct measurements in beam chambers will confirm this @xcite .",
    "most of the thin film sample were graciously produced by d. lee and a. wolski at lbnl , p. he and h.c hseuh at bnl .",
    "our first tizrv getter was produced at cern , thanks to v. ruzinov of the est group ."
