    "the study of graphs and trees , i.e.  objects ( or _ vertices _ ) with pairwise relations ( or _ edges _ ) between them , has a long and distinguished history throughout nearly all the sciences . in computer science , graphs , trees and their study",
    "are closely connected , e.g.  with sorting and search algorithms @xcite ; in chemistry the wiener number is a topological index intimately correlated with , e.g. , chemical and physical properties of alkane molecules @xcite . in physics , graphs are equally ubiquitous , not least because of their immediate usefulness for systematic perturbation calculations in quantum field theories @xcite . in mathematics ,",
    "graph theory is in itself an accepted branch of mainstream research and graphs are a central part of the field of discrete mathematics @xcite .",
    "an important concept that appears in all these fields is the _ distance _ in a graph , i.e.  the number of edges connecting two vertices @xcite . for trees ,",
    "i.e.  undirected graphs in which any two vertices are connected by only one path , various results exist @xcite , for example , that compute the distance from the top of the tree to its leaves .",
    "tree - like structures have recently also become more prominent in quantum physics of interacting particles with the advent of so - called tensor network methods @xcite .",
    "these provide elegant and powerful tools for the simulation of low dimensional quantum many - body systems . in a recent publication @xcite",
    "we show that certain correlation functions and measures of quantum entanglement can be constructed by a holographic distance and connectivity dependence along a tree network connecting certain leaves @xcite . in these quantum systems ,",
    "the leaves are ordered according to their physical position , for example the location of magnetic ions in a quantum wire .",
    "this ordering imposes a new restriction on the tree itself and the lengths which become important are leaf - to - leaf distances across the ordered tree .",
    "we emphasize that these distances therefore correspond to quite different measures than those studied in the various sciences mentioned before .",
    "we also note that in tensor networks the leaf - to - leaf distance is referred to as the _ path length _ @xcite , but in graph theory this term usually refers to the sum of the levels of each of the vertices in the tree @xcite .    in the present work",
    ", we shall concentrate on full and complete trees that have the same structure as regular tree tensor networks @xcite .",
    "we derive the average leaf - to - leaf distances for varying leaf separation with leaves ordered in a one - dimensional line as shown e.g.  in fig .",
    "[ fig - binarytree](a ) for a binary tree .",
    "\\(a )   ( b )     [ fig - binarytree ]    the method is then generalized to @xmath0-ary trees and the moments of the leaf - to - leaf distances .",
    "explicit analytical results are derived for finite and infinite trees .",
    "we also consider the case of periodic trees .",
    "we then illustrate how such properties may arise in the field of tensor networks .",
    "last , we numerically study the case of incomplete random trees , which is closest related to the tree tensor networks considered in ref .  @xcite .",
    "let us start by considering the complete binary tree shown in figure [ fig - binarytree](a ) .",
    "it is a connected graph where each vertex is @xmath2-valent and there are no loops .",
    "the _ root node _ is the vertex with just two degrees at the top of figure [ fig - binarytree](a ) .",
    "the rest of the vertices each have two _ child _ nodes and one parent .",
    "a _ leaf node _ has no children .",
    "the _ depth _ of the tree denotes the number of vertices from the root node with the root node at depth zero . with these definitions ,",
    "a binary tree is _ complete _ or _ perfect _ if all of the leaf nodes are at the same depth and all the levels are completely filled .",
    "we now denote by the _ level _ , @xmath3 , a complete set of vertices that have the same depth .",
    "these are enumerated with the root level as @xmath4 .",
    "we will refer to a _ level @xmath3 tree _ as a complete tree where the leaves are at level @xmath3 .",
    "the _ leaf - to - leaf distance _ , @xmath5 , is the number of edges that are passed to go from one leaf node to another ( cp .",

    "let us now impose an _ order _ on the tree of figure [ fig - binarytree](a ) such that the leaves are enumerated from left to right to indicate position values , @xmath6 , for leaf @xmath7 .",
    "then we can define a leaf _ separation _",
    "@xmath8 for any pair of leaves @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is equivalent to the notion of distance on a one - dimensional physical lattice .",
    "let the _ length _ @xmath10 be the length of the lattice , i.e.  number of leaf nodes .",
    "then for such a complete binary tree , we have @xmath11",
    ".    clearly , there are many pairs of leaves separated by @xmath1 from each other ( cp .",
    "figure [ fig - binarytree](a ) ) .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the set of all corresponding leaf - to - leaf distances .",
    "we now want to calculate the average leaf - to - leaf distance @xmath13 from the set @xmath12 .",
    "we first note that for a level @xmath3 tree the number of possible paths with separation @xmath1 is @xmath14 . in figure",
    "[ fig - binarytree - maximalpaths](b ) , we see that any complete level @xmath3 tree can be decomposed into two level @xmath15 sub - trees each of which contains @xmath16 leaves .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the sum of all possible leaf - to - leaf distances encoded in the set @xmath12 .",
    "the structure of the decomposition in figure [ fig - binarytree - maximalpaths](b ) suggests that we need to distinguish two classes of separations @xmath1 .",
    "first , for @xmath18 , paths are either completely contained within each of the two level @xmath15 trees or they bridge from the left level @xmath15 tree to the right level @xmath15 tree .",
    "those which are completely contained sum to @xmath19 . for those paths with separation @xmath1 that bridge across the two level @xmath20 trees , there are @xmath1 of such paths and each path has lengths @xmath21 .",

    "when @xmath1 becomes larger than the sub - tree size the leaf - to - leaf distance can no longer be @xmath54 but always larger , so there is a cusp where this distance is removed from the possibilities .",

    "the distances of these paths is solely determined by @xmath3 irrespective of the number of children and hence remains @xmath23 .",

    "( a ) ( b )    [ fig : alltrees_9 ] [ fig - binary - random ]    we see in figure [ fig - binary - random](a ) that , similar to the complete binary trees considered in the section [ sec - binary - averagepathlength ] , the leaf - to - leaf distances increase with @xmath1 until they reach a maximal value . unlike the complete tree in figure [ fig - bin - lr](a )",
    ", they start to decrease rapidly beyond this point .",
    "we also see that for such small trees , we are still far from the infinite complete tree result @xmath184 of equation ( [ eqn - ana - lq - inf ] ) .",
    "finally , we also see that when we choose @xmath185 random binary trees from the @xmath186 possible such trees at @xmath187 that the average leaf - to - leaf distances for each @xmath1 is still distinguishably different from an exact summation of all leaf - to - leaf distances .",

    "this result is then generalized to a complete tree where each vertex has any finite number of children .",
    "in addition to the mean leaf - to - leaf distance , it is found that the raw moments of the distribution of leaf - to - leaf distances have an analytic form that can be expressed in a concise way in terms of the hurwitz - lerch zeta function .",
    "these findings are calculated for open trees , where the leaves form an open line , periodic trees , where the leaves form a circle , and infinite trees , which is the limit where the number of levels , @xmath3 , goes to infinity .",
    "each of these results has a concise form and characteristic features due to the self - similarity of the trees .",
    "we believe that these results provide a useful insight into the structure of the regular tree graphs that are relevant for the field of tensor networks @xcite .",
    "we also note that leaf - to - leaf distances computed here are qualitatively similar , but quantitatively different from those for random - spin chains @xcite .",
