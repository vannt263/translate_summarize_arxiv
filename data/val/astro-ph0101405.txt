    "the purpose of this paper is to better constrain the slope of the ",
    "relation using recently published data .",

    "this difficulty probably arises from the relatively large distance of the seyfert galaxies ( @xmath47  mpc ) , compared with the nearby normal galaxies ( @xmath48  mpc ) , which makes it hard to obtain an accurate bulge + disk + point source decomposition .",

    "following the derivation in eqs.2 - 4 for the combined sample fit ( eq.7 ) gives ( m_bh / m_bulge)=0.54(m_bulge / m_)-8.56 .",

    "however , the projection of the core fundamental plane on the @xmath90 plane ( the `` faber - jackson '' relation ) is much flatter than assumed by ferrarese & merritt .",
    "for example , nelson & whittle ( 1996 ) find @xmath91 in seyfert galaxies , and inspection of the g00 sample suggests a similar relation ( see also fig.4b in faber et al . ) .",
    "the ferrarese & merritt relation then implies @xmath92 , while the g00 relation , @xmath93 , implies @xmath94 , both of which are comparable to the nonlinear slopes found here .",

    "relation for their sample of active galaxies , with /=0.25% . specifically",
    ", they find a slope of @xmath95 in the bulge magnitude vs. log  plane , which corresponds to a slope of @xmath96 [ @xmath97 in log  vs. bulge magnitude , consistent with the slope of @xmath98 found here for the combined sample of quasars and seyfert galaxies (  2.3.2 ) .",
    "however , they then assume @xmath99@xmath100 , as infered by jorgensen , franx & kjaergaard ( 1996 ) from their gunn - r study of elliptical galaxies in nearby rich clusters .",
    "this slope then leads to @xmath101 , consistent with a linear relation .",
    "however , the magorrian et al .",
    "dependence , @xmath99@xmath102 , is more appropriate here since it was determined directly by modeling the stellar dynamics , rather than through scaling relations ( dressler et al .",
    "1987 ) , it is deduced in the @xmath103 band , consistent with our use of @xmath28 , and it is based on a sample of nearby galaxies which partly overlaps the g00 sample .      the large scatter in the ",
    "relation was noted by many aothors .",
    "below we suggest that this may be due to relatively few anomalous galaxies .",
    "for example ,",
    "ngc  4342 deviates significantly from the ",
    "relation , being 3 magnitudes fainter than expected for its  ( fig.1a ) . similarly , ngc  4486b with @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( magorrian et al . ) , is 4 magnitudes fainter than expected ( see also fig.1 in l98 ) .",
    "faber et al .",
    "noted that ngc  4486b deviates significantly from the core fundamental plane relation , being 4 magnitudes fainter than expected for its central velocity dispersion of @xmath106  km  s@xmath16 at @xmath105 ( their fig.4b ) .",
    "ngc  4342 , with @xmath107  km  s@xmath16 and @xmath108 , is also similarly offset from the core fundamental plane .",
    "faber ( 1973 ) suggested that these offset galaxies are `` tightly bound cores of normal elliptical galaxies whose outer regions have been stripped away in tidal interactions with more massive companions '' .",
    "these anomalous galaxies would then have a @xmath9 which corresponds to their original , but a lower current .",
    "this may explain why they are outliers in the ",
    "relation , but not in the @xmath9 relation , as found by g00 and ferrarese & merritt .",
    "exclusion of galaxies which do not follow the core fundamental plane may significantly reduce the scatter in the   relation .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to point out that the relation appears to be nonlinear , with /  increasing from @xmath4% in the least luminous bulges with detected black holes ( @xmath5 ) to @xmath2% in bright ellipticals ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the slopes of the @xmath9 relation found by g00 and ferrarese & merritt , together with the faber - jackson relation , also indicate a nonlinear   relation , as do the low upper limits on  in late type spirals . the larger scatter in the   relation , compared with the @xmath9 relation , may be due to relatively few anomalous galaxies which do not follow the core fundamental plane relation .",
    "forthcoming systematic hst determinations of  in large samples of nearby galaxies ( e.g. marconi et al .",
    "2000 ) , and  determinations in large samples of active galaxies , will allow to establish the slope , scatter , and nature of outliers in the   relation .",
    "late type spirals , and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. laor 2000 ) would be especially important since they are expected to have particularly low , and thus provide the strongest leverage on the strength and slope of the ",
