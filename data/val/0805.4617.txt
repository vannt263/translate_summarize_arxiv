    "coulomb crystal formation is among the most exciting cooperative phenomena in charged particle systems and has been observed in a variety of fields , including ultracold ions in paul and penning traps @xcite , electrons and excitons in semiconductor quantum dots @xcite and bilayers @xcite .",
    "coulomb crystallization occurs also in classical and quantum two - component systems such as electron - ion or electron - hole plasmas @xcite or laser cooled expanding plasmas @xcite , for a recent overview see @xcite .",
    "of particular recent interest has been crystallization of charged microspheres in complex plasmas in two dimensions @xcite , as well as in three dimensions @xcite since here the structure and dynamics of the individual particles is directly visible or recordable by standard ccd cameras , e.g. @xcite . + from the theoretical side , the shell structure of spherically confined coulomb crystals has been analyzed in great detail by computer simulations , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "more accurate data including metastable states have recently been presented @xcite resulting in a very good understanding of these systems . however ,",
    "in dusty plasmas the interaction of the two particles forming a crystal is screened by the surrounding electrons and ions which has a significant influence on the crystal structure . in @xcite",
    "it was shown , by comparison with experiments , that the pair interaction is well described by an isotropic yukawa potential and shell configurations for various values of the screening strength have been presented .",
    "it was found that screening leads to a cluster compression , a change of the average density profile @xcite and to an enhanced population of the inner shells .",
    "yet a detailed understanding of how these shell occupation changes proceed is still missing .",
    "this is the goal of the present paper .",
    "+ here we present a detailed analysis of the ground state configurations of mesoscopic clusters interacting via an isotropic yukawa potential containing @xmath1 to @xmath2 particles in a wide range of screening parameters @xmath3 .",
    "while the general trend that with increased @xmath4 particles move inward is confirmed , we observe several anomalies which are due to symmetry effects : 1 . upon @xmath4 increase",
    "two particles move to the inner shell at once .",
    "2 . when the particle number is increased by one at a fixed @xmath4 one particle move from the inner to the outer shell and 3 . at very large @xmath4 there exist cases of reentrent shell fillings : one particle returns from the inner to the outer shell .",
    "we consider @xmath0 identical yukawa interacting classical particles with mass @xmath5 and charge @xmath6 in a three - dimensionsal isotropic harmonic confinement potential described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 this model has been found close to the experimental situation under which spherical dust crystals form @xcite . in the simulations we use dimensionless length and energy variables by introducing the units @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . +",
    "this model was already used to find the ground state configurations and their energies for coulomb interaction in @xcite .",
    "here we extended the investigation to the ground states of finite yukawa systems . to obtain the ground states we perform extensive molecular dynamics simulation using a standard simulated annealing technique , e.g.@xcite .",
    "this is done by slowing down the particles by some friction in every time step , starting from a random configuration .",
    "a stable state is reached when the dimensionless force on each particle is zero ( less than @xmath10 in the calculations ) .",
    "it was observed previously for coulomb systems that there exist different states with the same shell configuration , which differ with respect to the particle arrangement within the shells ( fine structure ) @xcite . here ,",
    "these energy differences which are less than @xmath11 in dimensionless units will not be resolved since this would blow up the whole analysis and we record only the energetically lowest shell configurations for a given value of @xmath4 .",
    "metastable states with a different shell configuration are sometimes energetically very close to the ground state .",
    "also , their number is increasing approximately exponentially with @xmath0 @xcite which requires special care in the numerical approach , in particular in the choice of the cooling speed .",
    "also , for given parameters , the cooling process has to be repeated sufficiently often . in the present calculations",
    ", we typically used @xmath12-@xmath13 independent runs for every set of @xmath14 . while this does not guarantee that the true ground state is found",
    "it does ensure a sufficiently high probability that no other state with lower energy exists . as an independent tool to verify the results we performed for a number of cases standard metropolis monte carlo simulations .    we simulated particle numbers from @xmath1 to @xmath2 and screenings from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the screening parameter was changed in steps of @xmath17 .",
    "when for some @xmath0 a configuration change at some critical @xmath4 was detected , the calculation around this point was repeated with a substantial smaller @xmath4 step to ensure an accuracy of @xmath18 .",
    "the choice of this interval of screening parameters is motivated by the situation of typical dusty plasma experiments where @xmath4 is around @xmath19 .",
    "besides , it is of theoretical interest what will be the asymptotic shell configuration in the limit of a very short range interaction . to this end we also analyzed the ground state at @xmath20 and recorded structural transitions occuring between @xmath21 and @xmath20 .",
    "a typical simulation result is shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] where we plot the total energy per particle for the cluster @xmath22 in the range of @xmath23 .",
    "as one can see the energy decreases rapidly with @xmath4 by approximately one order of magnitude , due to the reduction of the pair interaction strength . the same behavior is observed for other particle numbers , as shown for @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and , for @xmath25 , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . due to the exponential dependence on the distance",
    "one may wonder if the energy decrease with @xmath4 follows an exponential law as well as is the case in macroscopic one - component yukawa plasmas , e.g. @xcite .",

    "the vertical blue dashed line denotes the screening from which the configuration @xmath28 begins to occur in the simulations .",
    "the configuration @xmath26 is present in the complete range of screening .",
    "the inset shows the energy difference per particle of these two configurations in a small range of screening parameters around the critical value , where the ground state shell configuration changes from @xmath26 to @xmath28 .",
    "the critical value is indicated by the vertical black dashed line in the figure as well as in the inset.,width=272 ]    the simplest fit for the ground state total energy per particle has the form @xmath29 and uses three @xmath4 independent free parameters which are functions of the particle number . in the analyzed range of @xmath0 this dependence",
    "is found to be close to @xmath30 , for the two energies @xmath31 and @xmath32 , whereas the effective length @xmath33 in the exponent scales approximately as @xmath34 . using the exact results for the ground state energies per particle from the molecular dynamics simulations we obtain the following best fit for the three coefficients : @xmath35 in the coulomb limit this fit reduces to @xmath36 this fit is useful to understand the main trends in the analyzed parameter range and reproduces the simulation data within several percent .",

    "( [ eq3 ] ) , compared to the exact results from md simulations , and the relative error @xmath37 , for some examples . [ cols=\"^,^,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , there are six remarkable cases which violate this trend : @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "consider first the total particle number @xmath39 .",
    "this case is interesting because it is the only case where the central configuration @xmath40 is part of the ground state , apart from the cluster with @xmath41 at screenings @xmath42 .",
    "this arrangement does otherwise not occur because the clusters prefer the platonic body with @xmath41 particles on the inner shell ( closed shell configuration ) . here",
    "the configuration @xmath43 becomes the ground state at @xmath44 and remains the ground state for larger screening .    in the other five cases we observed , at @xmath45 , several stationary states which differed",
    "only very little in their energies .",
    "we , therefore , performed molecular dynamics simulations using separately each of these states as an input at @xmath45 and then decreased the screening slightly , letting the system relax into a new stationary state , often with the same configuration and symmetry .",
    "this way we could be certain to follow all metastable states and independently record their energy dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "the above five cases fall into two groups which differ with respect to the cluster symmetry . for the first",
    ", i.e. @xmath46 , the cluster decreases the number of particles on the inner shell when the screening is increased between @xmath16 to @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting new ground state configuration contains again a platonic body on the inner shell .",

    "[ fig6 ] . here , first the second shell popluation increases by one , at @xmath69 , according to @xmath70 .",
    "further increase of screening makes a third configuration more favorable which has even two particles less on the second shell : the configuration @xmath71 becomes the ground state again at @xmath72 which again is a consequence of the high symmetry ( closed shell configuration ) .",

    "particle moves to the inner shell until at @xmath53 this transition is reversed ( the only difference for @xmath55 is that there is an additional ground state configuration between these two critical screenings ) : one particle moves outward and the original configuration with fewer particles on the inner shell is restored which remains the ground state for all larger values of @xmath4 .",
    "this contradiction to the general trend ( of increasing the inner shell population with increased screening ) , together with the reappearance of a ground state configuration , will be called `` anomaly of the third kind '' .",
    "the complete set of these cases can be found in tab .",

    "the reentrance of these ground state configurations at large screening are in all cases not different in their symmetry compared to the ground state configurations below @xmath52 , they have the same number of nearest neighbors and same shape of the voronoi cells , with only their length scale strongly reduced due to the weaker interaction force .",
    "in general , the restored ground state configurations consist of platonic bodies on the inner shell , except for the case of @xmath50 . here , the ground state configuration changes from @xmath75 to @xmath76 at a screening value of @xmath77 and back to @xmath75 at a screening value of @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath79 particles on the inner shell are not a platonic body and , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it is not a common configuration compared to @xmath80 or @xmath81 particles in the center .",
    "nevertheless , this can be understood by looking at the outer shell .",
    "the @xmath82 particles are placed on the edges of an icosaeder which results in a highly symmetric configuration for the outer shell .",
    "the goal of this paper was to present , for the first time , a detailed analysis of the ground state shell configurations of yukawa clusters in a parabolic shperical confinement over a broad range of screening parameters @xmath83 .",
    "this allowed us to analyze the structural transitions occuring when the pair interaction changes from long range , in the coulomb case , to short range , at the largest values of @xmath4 .",
    "focusing on a finite range of particle numbers , @xmath84 we presented a complete overview on all existing changes of the shell configurations for @xmath85 . for larger @xmath4",
    "we also noted the cases where the configurations are different at @xmath21 and @xmath20 ( we can not rule out that , in this range , there occur transtions in addition to those given ) .",
    "the general trend observed earlier @xcite was confirmed : with increased screening , more particles tend to populate the inner shell(s ) of the cluster giving rise to an average density profile which decreases increasingly fast towards the edge @xcite .",
    "there are , however , three non - trivial deviations ( `` anomalies '' ) from this shell filling sequence which were analyzed : 1 . ) upon @xmath4 increase two particles move to ( one of ) the inner shell(s ) at once",
    "when the particle number is increased by one , at a fixed @xmath4 , one particle moves from the inner to the outer shell and 3 . ) at very large @xmath4 there exist cases of reentrent shell fillings : one particle returns from the inner to the outer shell .",
    "these anomalies are , in most cases , dictated by symmetry properties of the corresponding state which allow to lower the total energy .",
    "our results are expected to be useful also for experiments with dusty plasmas and allow us to predict interesting parameter ranges which give information on the effect of symmetry on the structure of mesoscopic systems . in current experiments on spherical dust crystals performed at the universities kiel and greifswald @xcite typical values of the screening parameter",
    "are in the range of @xmath86 .",
    "while this gives access only to a small part of the analyzed parameters where no reentrant shell fillings ( third anomaly ) occur , still the first two effects should be observable . while the experiments on small clusters do not necessarily reveal the ground state configurations , since often metastable states occur with a higher probability @xcite the prediction of parameters where two states have the same energy is of practical interest for the analysis of potential energy barriers and intershell transitions .",
