    "the spectral radius of infinite planar graphs , in particular for tesselations of the hyperbolic plane , is of great interest in harmonic analysis .",
    "we refer to @xcite and to @xcite for an overview .",
    "tessellations , whose graphs are regular of degree @xmath30 , may have the spectral radius as large as @xmath30",
    ". however , this happens precisely when the graph is _ amenable _ ( cf . ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is also equivalent to the condition that the random walk on the graph is recurrent .",
    "this case is well understood . however , in the case of the tessellations of the hyperbolic plane ( or more general _",
    "cantor spheres _ , see @xcite ) the random walk is transient ( dodziuk @xcite ) , the isoperimetric number ( or the cheeger constant ) is positive @xcite , and the spectral radius is strictly smaller than @xmath30",
    ". it can be as small as @xmath34 ( in the case of the @xmath30-regular tree ) .",
    "quantitative relationship between these notions is provided via cheeger inequality ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus surprising that the exact values for the spectral radius of regular tessellations of the hyperbolic plane are not known .",

    "the second structure are extensions of other structures by adding a bounded number of new vertices or adding so - called `` vortices '' to the surface structure .",
    "this is somewhat technical and we will not consider it at this point . the last structure is related to `` tree - like decompositions '' and , in particular , gives rise to the family of graphs of bounded tree - width .",
    "these graphs are degenerate in the sense that they can be reduced to the empty graph by successively removing vertices of small degree .",
    "one can prove similar bounds on the spectral radius as presented in this paper , but the detailed analysis requires additional work and we leave details for future work .",
