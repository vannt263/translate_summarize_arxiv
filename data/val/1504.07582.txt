    "the simplest relativistic generalization of the schrdinger equation is the `` square root klein - gordon equation '' : @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is the wave function in momentum space representation and @xmath4 is the relativistic hamiltonian ; @xmath5 .",
    "this equation can be rewritten in position space representation as follow : @xmath6 the above equation , sometimes called `` salpeter '' equation .",
    "this equation and its integral representations can be uniquely derived from following simple assumptions : ( 1 ) the equation has the first order of time . ( 2 ) the equation is linear . ( 3 ) the equation leads to relativistic dispersion relation for plane waves ( in other words , being consistent with de broglie relations ) .",
    "the history of the square root klein - gordon equation ( srkg equation ) goes back to the early years of relativistic quantum mechanics . in the 1927 weyl",
    "proposed the operator @xmath7 for the formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "but he did not expand his idea as a comprehensive theory and also other pioneers of quantum mechanics used different methods for the formulation relativistic quantum mechanics which led to other wave equations such as dirac and klein - gordon equations . on the other hand , although the srkg equation lacks proper theoretical characteristics and even gets rid of some difficulties that other relativistic wave equations have ( such as klein paradox and `` zitterbewegung '' ) , but higher order derivatives in this equation makes it look more complicated than the other quantum wave equations ; therefore it attracted less attention during the historical development of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "but after derivation of this equation from bethe - salpeter formalism @xcite , it was more attention . in this regard , in the recent years , theoretical characteristics and integral representations of this equation have been attracting special attention @xcite .",
    "also , this equation has been successfully used in description of several relativistic problems and phenomena ; such as relativistic harmonic oscillator @xcite , waves in relativistic quantum plasma @xcite , relativistic ( quark ) bound states @xcite , and the relativistic bohmian mechanics @xcite .",
    "we particularly note the consistency of the results of this equation with the experimental spectrum of mesonic atoms @xcite .",
    "in addition , since this equation is of first order with respect to time , there is the possibility of using the born interpretation , @xmath0 , for the interpretation of the wave function and as a result it avoid of negative probability problem of the klein - gordon equation . in this regard , k. kowalski and j. rembielinski derived , the position born s probability density and its corresponding current density in the momentum representation as follow @xcite :    @xmath8    @xmath9    in which the `` velocity '' , @xmath10 defined as @xmath11 . this very possibility of a probabilistic interpretation of the wave function has been often the stimulus to using this equation . on the other hand ,",
    "the lorentz invariance of the srkg equation has always been under discussion because of its high derivatives , in fact checking lorentz invariance of this equation is complicated and can not be specified easily .",
    "therefor sometimes because of the inequality of time and space derivatives , this equation has been mistakenly accepted as a frame dependent equation and incompatible with special relativity @xcite .",
    "but it has been shown that if the wave function is scalar this equation is lorentz invariant ( in the absence of interactions ) @xcite .",
    "but we need to pay attention that born rule , @xmath12 , is inconsistent with assuming the wave function as scalar .",
    "because the position probability density is the first component of the probability current four - vector and can not be scalar . on the other word , because of the relativistic length contraction , the probability density can not be scalar .",
    "hence , born rule ( eq.([3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) ) can not be a proper interpretation for the scalar wave function .",
    "in fact in the rest of this article we will show even if the wave function is not scalar , born rule will still not be proper for the probabilistic interpretation of the wave function .",
    "it means that no transformation will be found for the wave function in a way to cause born probability density and born current densities(eq.([3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) ) become altogether as one four - vector .",
    "so , the born rule must be modified to conform with lorentz symmetry .",
    "in this regard , we find a proper relativistic modification of the born rule for scalar wave function ( spin 0 particles ) in the section ( i ) and for spin 1/2 particles in the section ( ii ) .",
    "we propose the relativistic generalization of the born rule as follows : @xmath13 in which @xmath14 , is defined as : @xmath15 the expression ( [ 5 ] ) is the simplest covariant generalization of the eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) and eq.([4 ] ) .",
    "in fact by means of direct ( and also long ) calculation , we can see that @xmath16 is actually a four - vector and as a result,@xmath17 is a four - vector as well - of course if the wave function be scalar(see section ii ) .",
    "it can also be simply shown that @xmath17 ( as was defined above ) satisfies the continuity equation .",
    "it is obvious that the first component of the @xmath17specify the relativistic generalization of the born rule in the momentum representation : @xmath18 the question that arises at this point is whether the definition ( [ 7 ] ) lead to a positive definite probability density . for answering this question , we note that the coefficient @xmath19 in the expression ( [ 7 ] ) can be separated as follow : @xmath20 where @xmath21.through the aid of this separation , the position probability density can be derived in position space representation as follow : @xmath22\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is compton wavelength ; @xmath24 .",
    "so eq.([7 ] ) leads to a positive - definite probability density .",
    "it is clear that in non- relativistic limit , @xmath25 , the equation ( 9 ) reduce to born rule , @xmath26 .",
    "in addition , if @xmath27 then @xmath28 and the expression ( [ 7 ] ) gives the non - relativistic expression ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "it means that whenever the width of wave packet in momentum space is small in comparison with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , deviation of @xmath31 from @xmath32 will be negligible . as a result , based on uncertainty relations , deviation of @xmath31 from @xmath32",
    "is considerable only if the width of wave packet is smaller than the compton wavelength @xmath33 . to see this fact explicitly ,",
    "we plot the relativistic ( eq.([9 ] ) ) and nonrelativistic ( born rule ) probability density for a particle in one dimensional infinite square well potential . from fig .",
    "( 1 ) it is obvious that if the width of the box , @xmath34 , is greater than the compton wavelength of the particle , @xmath23 , the diagram of the relativistic probability density , @xmath31 , will be coincident with the diagram of the born probability density , @xmath35 ; and whenever the width of the box is smaller than the compton wavelength then @xmath31 will deviates from @xmath35 .",
    "in fact if@xmath36 then the probability of the particle s presence in the box will be uniform(see figure.1 ) .     ; red diagrams represent the relativistic probability density,@xmath31 , for the first excited state n=2 of particle in infinite potential well .",
    "the diagram is drawn considering different width of the box : ( a)@xmath37 , ( b)@xmath38 and ( c)@xmath39 . ]",
    "particle and spin @xmath72 particle in one dimensional box .",
    "the ( dashed ) green line represents born probability density , the blue line represent @xmath69 and the red line represent the @xmath82 .",
    "the wave function of particle is considered as @xmath83 which @xmath84 is the width of the box and we consider @xmath85 . ]",
    "in this article we have introduced relativistic generalization for the born rule for particles with zero and half spins .",
    "therefore it seems that the srkg equation with the appropriate interpretation of the wave function can be adapted to use for particles having various spins .",
