    "search for supersymmetry ( susy ) is an important task for the lhc .",
    "the current null search results indicate that the susy breaking scale may be far above the weak scale and hence we must tolerate some extent of unnaturalness .",
    "however , for the explanation of dark matter relic density and the unification of gauge couplings , the electroweak gauginos and higgsinos ( collectively called electroweakinos ) can not be too heavy and should be accessible in the upcoming runs of the lhc @xcite .",
    "search for these electroweakinos at the lhc is rather challenging and has been recently intensively studied @xcite .",
    "for example , when the lightest electroweakinos have compressed mass spectrum , their pair productions through drell - yan processes only give missing energy and an extra jet or gauge boson is needed for the detection @xcite .",
    "another type of productions of electroweakinos at the lhc is vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , which is shown quite promising despite of small cross sections @xcite .",
    "these vbf productions naturally produce two highly energetic quark jets with large dijet invariant mass in the forward and backward regions of the detector @xcite .",
    "an important feature of vbf is the absence of color exchange between these two jets , which leads to a reduction of gluon emission in the central region .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of typical qcd backgrounds . due to this feature",
    ", the vbf processes have been studied for producing electroweakinos @xcite and the higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "note that in the vbf productions of electroweakinos at the lhc , e.g. , the dominant channel @xmath3 , in order to have a sizable cross section , the lightest electroweakinos ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) must be wino - like and have compressed mass spectrum , which gives a signal of two jets plus missing energy in the general framework of minimal supersymmetric model with r - parity . in the multi - sector susy breaking scenario , however , both @xmath4 and @xmath5 can decay to visible particles plus pseudo - goldstino inside the detector and then the vbf production @xmath3 will give rather different signals .",
    "such multi - sector susy breaking scenario refers to susy breaking in more than one hidden sector , in which one goldstino will become the longitudinal component of gravitino and other orthogonal states will become the physical pseudo - goldstinos .",
    "unconstrained by the supercurrent , the couplings of the pseudo - goldstinos could be large enough to have intriguing phenomenology @xcite . in our previous work @xcite we investigated the drell - yan productions of the lightest electroweakinos followed by the decays to pseudo - goldstino at the lhc . in this work",
    "we extend the study to the vbf productions of electroweakinos .",
    "the structure of this note is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we briefly describe the neutralino and chargino decays to pseudo - goldstino , and then perform the monte carlo simulations for the signal and backgrounds of their vbf productions at the lhc .",
    "finally our conclusions are given in section iii .",
    "we now recapitulate our scenario ( for a detailed description , see our previous work @xcite ) .",
    "our scenario is that susy is broken in two hidden sectors , in which the sector with a low susy breaking scale gives very small contribution to the soft gaugino masses . in this scenario",
    "the pseudo - goldstino ( @xmath6 ) couplings to the photon and transverse @xmath7-boson are suppressed while its interaction with higgs and longitudinal gauge bosons are enhanced comparing to ordinary gravitino .",
    "so a light neutral higgsino can decay to a higgs boson or @xmath7-boson plus @xmath6 while a light charged higgsino can only decay to a @xmath8-boson plus @xmath6 ( because the charged higgs is usually heavier than the light charged higgsino ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dia1 ] . in the vbf productions ,",
    "the chargino ( @xmath9 ) and neutralino ( @xmath5 ) must be wino - like in order for a sizable production rate .",
    "such a wino - like neutralino can have a decay @xmath10 through its mixing with the neutral higgsino , while the wino - like chargino can have a decay @xmath11 through two insertions .",
    "since the two insertions may lead to a rather small decay width , the gravitino ( goldstino ) channel @xmath12 can be comparable .",
    "considering the gravitino and pseudo - goldstino have the same collider signature ( missing energy ) , we only consider the pseudo - goldstino decay channel .     and",
    "higgsino @xmath13 in the two - sector susy breaking scenario .",
    "]    as in our previous work @xcite , we can start the analysis from the effective interaction between pseudo - goldstino , chargino and neutralino @xmath14 , \\label{eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 with @xmath16 being the susy breaking scales in two hidden sectors , @xmath17 with @xmath18 and @xmath19 the soft masses for the chiral fields . with fixed parameters @xmath20 and all the couplings @xmath21 ,",
    "the decay width of neutralino or chargino into pseudo - goldstino is of the order @xmath22 gev and the decay length is about @xmath23 cm which means that the decays will occur inside the detector . as shown in fig .  2 of @xcite , the lightest electroweakinos decay dominantly to pseudo - goldstino and in our calculation we the assume such a decay has a branching of 100% .      for neutralino / chargino productions through vbf processes , we focus on the pair production of a neutralino and a chargino .",
    "the representative feynman diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "note that apart from these pure vbf processes , some non - vbf processes could also provide the same final states .",
    "for instance , the higher order qcd effects in the drell - yan productions of neutralino and chargino could also give contributions because of the hard emission of partons from the initial states . in our calculation , we consider the full set of diagrams and employ kinematic constraints to reduce the contribution from non - vbf processes .",
    "the main feature of vbf processes is the presence of two jets produced in the forward and backward regions at the detector and with large pseudo - rapidity separation between them .",
    "they also must be hard enough in order to create a pair of neutralino and chargino .",
    "therefore , we calculate the cross sections by characterizing the signal in terms of the following selections :    * the two jets in the forward / backward regions , labeled as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , must satisfy the requirement @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "* we accept the jets with @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 .",
    "* the invariant mass of these two jets should be large , @xmath30 gev .",
    "14 tev and 8 tev . ]",
    "now we discuss the productions of neutralinos and charginos through vbf . in our study ,",
    "the squarks , sleptons , gluino and non - sm higgs bosons are assumed too heavy to be inaccessible .",
    "we fix the mass of the sm - like higgs boson at 125 gev . for the parameter space in the neutralino / chargino sector ,",
    "we focus on the region in which the lightest neutralino and chargino are wino - like because only the wino - like neutralino and chargino can be sizably produced via the vbf processes at the lhc @xcite .    for the wino - like neutralino and chargino , they are produced through the vbf channel @xmath31 in our numerical calculation",
    "we choose the same benchmark scenario as in @xcite : @xmath32 note that our results are not sensitive to the value of @xmath33 because the wino - like neutralino and chargino are produced in vbf processes dominantly via the gauge couplings .",
    "the value of @xmath33 can only have effects through the higgsino component which is small in a wino - like neutralino or chargino .",
    "on the other hand , since the neutralino and chargino produced in vbf processes are wino - like , their masses are mainly determined by the value of @xmath34 .",
    "so for a lower value of @xmath34 ( while being consistent with current lhc and lep limits ) , the neutralino and chargino are lighter , whose production rate is larger and the statistical significance can be higher .",
    "we first calculate their cross sections at the partonic level using the package madgraph5 @xcite and employ these cuts ( a)-(c ) for the two jets .",
    "the results at the lhc with @xmath35 tev and @xmath36 tev are displayed in fig .",
    "we check our results with calchep @xcite and find agreements . the results in fig .",
    "[ dia3 ] show that the largest cross sections come from @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the cross sections at 8 tev lhc are approximately 7 - 8 times smaller than 14 tev lhc .",
    "therefore , we consider the these two channels at the 14 tev lhc in the following analysis .",
    "we also check the higgsino - like and bino - like neutralino / chargino and find that their production cross sections are much smaller than the wino - like case .",
    "first we focus on the @xmath39 production . as we discussed earlier , in our scenario",
    "the lightest chargino @xmath40 decays to a pseudo - goldstino plus a @xmath8-boson and the lightest neutralino @xmath5 decays to a pseudo - goldstino plus a higgs boson .",
    "thus the signal of this production is a single lepton and two bottom quarks associated with two energetic light jets and large missing transverse energy : @xmath41 the dominant sm backgrounds are from the production of top quark pair with semi - leptonic decays of top quarks .",
    "the di - leptonic decays of top pair could also fake the signal when the @xmath42 lepton decays hadronically .",
    "in addition , the single top production and @xmath8+jets may also mimic the signal .",
    "the jets from these backgrounds are less energetic and more central in the detector , which are different from the signal .",
    "therefore , the vbf selection cuts could reduce them effectively",
    ". the productions of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) via vbf processes with the @xmath8-boson decaying leptonically and the vector boson decaying to a pair of quarks could also fake the signal .",
    "the missing energy in all these backgrounds come from neutrinos .",
    "but for the signal process , the pseudo - goldstino @xmath6 escapes the detector and leads to large missing energy .",
    "so the @xmath45 cut could further reduce these backgrounds . besides , the top pair production associated with a @xmath7-boson and the production of @xmath46 via vbf process could also fake the signal . due to smaller cross sections than other backgrounds",
    ", we do not consider them in this work .",
    "we use madgraph5 @xcite to generate the signal and background events . for our signal events generation , the effective lagrangian in eq .",
    "[ eff ] is implemented in feynrules @xcite and then passed to madgraph5 via the ufo model file @xcite .",
    "we apply pythia @xcite for parton shower and hadronization , delphes @xcite with the atlas detector for the fast detector simulations .",
    "the mlm scheme @xcite is used to match our matrix element with parton shower .",
    "jets are clustered employing fastjet @xcite with anti-@xmath47 algorithm @xcite using the radius parameter @xmath48 .",
    "finally , we employ madanalysis5 @xcite to perform sample analysis .     and @xmath45 distributions for the signal @xmath49 and background processes after vbf selections at the lhc with @xmath50  tev .",
    "for the signal we fixed the relevant mass parameters as @xmath51  gev , @xmath52  tev , @xmath53  tev.,title=\"fig : \" ] and @xmath45 distributions for the signal @xmath49 and background processes after vbf selections at the lhc with @xmath50  tev .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    as we discussed earlier , we must first impose the vbf selections to make the vbf processes dominant .",
    "then we present some kinematic distributions in order to get some other efficient cuts . in fig .",
    "[ figetmt ] , we display the normalized distribution of @xmath45 and transverse mass @xmath54 for the signal and background processes at the lhc with @xmath50 tev , where the @xmath55 is defined as @xmath56},\\ ] ] with @xmath57 standing for the azimuthal angle difference between the lepton and the missing energy .",
    "these distributions show that requiring a lower cut of about 150 gev for @xmath45 and 100 gev for @xmath54 could be effective to reduce the backgrounds .",
    "note that we have checked the vbf selection efficiency is @xmath58 for @xmath59jets background .",
    "in fig .  [ figwjj ] , we present the @xmath45 and @xmath54 distributions for signal and @xmath59 jets background before vbf selections",
    ". we can find that the @xmath45 and @xmath54 cuts can almost remove the @xmath59jets background .",
    "thus we neglect it in the following analysis . based on the above discussion",
    ", we summary our event selections in our final state analysis :    * vbf selections : we require at least four jets with @xmath60 gev in @xmath61 .",
    "there must also be one pair of light jets @xmath62 satisfying ; ( i ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; ( ii ) @xmath63 gev ; ( iii ) @xmath64 gev . * lepton selection : only one lepton with @xmath65 gev and @xmath66",

    "they have interpreted their results in the context of a simplified model , where they assumed the lightest neutralino ( @xmath72 ) is bino - like while the second lightest neutralino ( @xmath73 ) and the lightest chargino ( @xmath74 ) are wino - like ( their masses are approximately degenerate @xmath75 ) .",
    "they searched the production @xmath76 ( with 100@xmath67 branching ratios ) by employing the @xmath77 channel .",
    "the limit was found to be @xmath78 200 gev @xcite and 300 gev @xcite for @xmath79 30 gev .",
    "it means that in our scenario the benchmark point @xmath80 gev may have been excluded for @xmath81 gev and survive for @xmath82 gev and 80 gev .    before concluding , we make some comments .",
    "our simulations above are just to demonstrate that our scenario are possiblly accessible at the high - luminosity lhc . more dedicated selections of the signal from the backgrounds may improve the significance , which should be considered in the future experimental search .",
    "( 2 ) in our study we focused on mssm , while in other low energy susy models the pseudo - goldstino may also have similar new decay channels which deserve searches .",
    "the multi - sector susy breaking scenario predicts pseudo - goldstino , which can couple to the visible sector more strongly than the ordinary gravitino .",
    "then the lightest electroweakinos can decay to a pseudo - goldstino plus a @xmath7-boson , higgs boson or @xmath8-boson . in our previous work @xcite we investigated the drell - yan productions of the lightest electroweakinos followed by the decays to pseudo - goldstino at the lhc . in this work we extended the study to the vbf productions of electroweakinos . from the monte carlo simulations we found that the largest rate channel @xmath83 can have a statistical significance above @xmath2 at the 14 tev lhc with an luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath84 , while the second largest rate channel @xmath85 is not accessible .",
    "finally we point out that in our study we considered the decays of electroweakinos to a pseudo - goldstino , i.e. , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "our results are approximately applicable to other scenarios which predict a light singlet invisible particle ( @xmath88 ) as long as the decays @xmath89 and @xmath90 happen inside the detector . for example , in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model , the singlino - like lightest neutralino can be as light as a few gev @xcite and thus similar decays can happen for the chargino / neutralino .",
