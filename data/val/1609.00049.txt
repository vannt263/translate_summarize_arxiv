    "gromov - witten invariants naively count the number of ( pseudo)-holomorphic curves of a given symplectic manifold possibly with certain prescribed conditions . indeed ,",
    "when the curve class is primitive , one can slightly perturb the almost complex structure such that all the pseudo - holomorphic curves are fredholm regular .",
    "however , multiple covers of holomorphic curves occur when the curve classes are not primitive . in this situation ,",
    "multiple covers appear and the associated moduli spaces can have the dimension higher then the expected dimension .",
    "in particular , multiple covers cause transversality difficulties .",
    "the definition of gromov - witten invariants will involve the techniques of virtual fundamental cycles and referred as the `` virtual counting '' of holomorphic curves .",
    "the gromov - witten invariants are usually rational numbers due to the appearance of automorphisms of the holomorphic curves .",
    "it is not clear that what is the geometric meaning of these rational numbers and their relation with the `` counting '' of the holomorphic curves in the target calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "part of the gopakumar - vafa conjecture lights up a way to explain these numbers geometrically : one can rearrange the generating function of the gromov - witten invariants @xmath0 of genus @xmath1 and degree @xmath2 on a calabi - yau @xmath3-fold as follows : @xmath4 then the numbers @xmath5 , which contains the equivalent information as teh gromov - witten invariants , magically become integers",
    ". in particular , one has the following transformation for @xmath6 gromov - witten invariants @xmath7 and the integer invariants @xmath8 , @xmath9 which is usually known as the aspinwall - morrison formula @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "similar viewpoint also appears in taubes work , which relates the gromov invariants and seiberg - witten invariants @xcite .",
    "one may also try to consider the open string analogue gromov - witten invariants by naively counting riemann surfaces with boundaries inside a symplectic manifolds and certain boundary condition .",
    "similarly to the original situation , there are compactified moduli spaces of holomorphic curves with boundaries .",
    "however , the relevant compactified moduli spaces generally admit real codimension one boundaries and thus make the virtual fundamental classes not well - defined . as a consequence , the open gromov - witten invariants are usually only defined case by case . especially for the case when the target spaces are compact calabi - yau manifolds , the open gromov - witten invariants are defined in two cases in the literature : the target space admits an anti - symplectic involution and the lagrangian is the fixed locus @xcite . or the target space is a symplectic calabi - yau @xmath3-fold and the lagrangian is a homological @xmath3-sphere @xcite .",
    "if we restrict ourselves to calabi - yau @xmath10-folds , the k3 surfaces , then there is another difficulty arising from the dimension reason .",
    "the virtual dimension of the moduli spaces of holomorphic discs in a k3 surface and lagrangian boundary condition is minus one .",
    "in other words , there is no holomorphic discs in a k3 surface with respect to the generic almost complex structures .",
    "therefore , even the issue of real codimension boundary of the moduli space mentioned above can be resolved , we will expect the invariant to be zero .",
    "similar to the idea of reduced gromov - witten invariants , the author @xcite introduces an auxiliary @xmath11-parameter family of complex structures on the k3 surfaces and consider the moduli space of holomorphc discs in such @xmath11-parameter family .",
    "although the new moduli space is topologically the same as the original one , the naturally equipped kuranishi structures are different .",
    "one may view the procedure as a symplectic analogue of changing tangent - obstruction theory for defining the reduced gromov - witten invariants in algebraic geometry . in the paper @xcite , the author mainly studies the case when the situation when the boundaries of the holomorphic discs are not homologous to zero . in this case , the special lagrangian boundary conditions behave like certain stability conditions and there will be wall - crossing phenomenon similar to donaldson - thomas invariants when the lagrangian boundary conditions are changing .    in this paper , we will study the case when the boundary of the holomorhpic discs are homologous to the zero class . in this case , the bubbling phenomenon does nt really contribute to the wall - crossing formula for the reduced open gromov - witten invariants .",
    "however , another kind of real codimension one boundaries of the moduli spaces appear : the pseudo - holomorphic discs may degenerate to pseudo - holomorphic spheres with a marked points hitting the lagrangian submanifold . therefore , the corresponding reduced open gromov - witten invariants will jump when certain parameter vary and can be resembled from the closed reduced gromov - witten invariants @xcite@xcite .",
    "using the multiple cover formula of reduced gromov - witten invariants of genus zero @xcite , we derive the multiple cover formula for holomorhpic discs , as predicted in @xcite@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section two , we review the basic knowledge of hyperkhler manifold and holomorphic discs in twistor family . in section three , we define the reduced open gromov - witten invariants and study its wall - crossing formula . as a corollary , we derive the multiple cover formula for reduced open gromov - witten invariants via the wall - crossing formula .",
