    "the ocean of an accreting neutron star is composed of a variety of elements with atomic number z = 6 and larger , formed by nuclear burning of the accreted hydrogen and helium at low densities .",
    "the term ocean refers to the fact that the coulomb interaction energy between ions is greater than the thermal energy , such that the ions behave like a liquid .",
    "the ocean is of interest as the site of long duration thermonuclear flashes such as superbursts ( cumming & bildsten 2001 ; strohmayer & brown 2002 ; kuulkers 2004 ) and intermediate duration bursts ( in  t zand et al .",
    "2005 ; cumming et al .",
    "2006 ) , non - radial oscillations ( bildsten & cutler 1995 ; piro & bildsten 2005 ) , and because the matter in the ocean eventually solidifies as it is compressed to higher densities by ongoing accretion , and so determines the thermal , mechanical and compositional properties of the neutron star crust ( haensel & zdunik 1990 ; brown & bildsten 1998 ; schatz et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "at the base of the ocean , matter freezes as it is compressed by continuing accretion , becoming part of the solid crust .",
    "horowitz et al . ( 2007 ) carried out molecular dynamics simulations of the freezing of a mixture of 17 species taken from a calculation of rp - process hydrogen and helium burning and hence representative of the kind of mixture expected to make up the ocean of an accreting neutron star ( schatz et al .",
    "2001 ; gupta et al .",
    "they found that this mixture underwent chemical separation during crystallization , such that light elements ( charge number @xmath1 ) were preferentially left behind in the liquid , whereas heavier elements were preferentially incorporated into the solid . in a previous paper ( medin & cumming 2010 , hereafter paper i )",
    "we showed that this result can be understood by generalizing previous work using fits to the free energies of the liquid and solid states of binary and tertiary plasmas .    in this paper",
    ", we address the implications of chemical separation for the structure and composition of the ocean .",
    "horowitz et al . ( 2007 ) raised the question of what the steady - state ocean would look like , since the matter entering the crust is enriched in certain elements compared to others , and therefore different from the mean ocean composition .",
    "we investigate this question here , and argue that the retention of light elements in the liquid acts as a source of buoyancy that drives a slow but continual mixing of the ocean , enriching it substantially in light elements and leading to a relatively uniform composition with depth .",
    "the steady state arises as the ocean enriches in light elements to the point where the composition of the solid that forms upon freezing matches the composition of matter entering the top of the ocean .",
    "one motivation for studying this problem comes from models for superbursts which involve thermally - unstable carbon burning in the deep ocean of the neutron star ( cumming & bildsten 2001 ; strohmayer & brown 2002 ) . the energy release in these very long duration thermonuclear flashes , inferred from fitting their lightcurves ( cumming et al .",
    "2006 ) , corresponds to carbon fractions of @xmath2 .",
    "this has been challenging to produce in models of the nuclear burning of the accreted hydrogen and helium . if the hydrogen and helium burn unstably , the amount of carbon produced is @xmath3 ( woosley et al .",
    "2004 ) , and whereas stable burning can produce large carbon fractions ( schatz et al .",
    "2003 ) , time - dependent models do not show stable burning at the @xmath4 eddington accretion rates of superburst sources ( although observationally , superburst sources show evidence that much of the accreted material may not burn in type i bursts ; in  t zand et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "perhaps even more problematic than making enough carbon is that carbon ignition models for superbursts require large ocean temperatures @xmath5 at the ignition depth , which are difficult to achieve in standard models of crust heating ( e.g. , cumming et al .",
    "2006 ; keek et al .",
    "similarly , brown & cumming ( 2009 ) inferred a large inwards heat flux in the outer crust of the transiently - accreting neutron stars mxb 1659 - 29 and ks 1731 - 260 by fitting their cooling curves in quiescence .",
    "both of these observations imply an additional heating source in the outer crust or ocean is needed . in this paper",
    ", we begin to address the question of to what extent chemical separation could enrich the ocean in carbon and other light elements , or provide a heat source that could alleviate some of the difficulty of matching the observations of superbursts and transient cooling .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : mixing ] by reviewing the physics of chemical separation , and discussing the timescales on which accretion , crystallization , diffusion , sedimentation , and convection occur , leading us to a picture of compositionally - driven convection . in ",
    "[ sec : convect ] we calculate the structure of the steady - state ocean for two simplified models : first , accretion of a two - component mixture composed of se and either o or fe ; and second , accretion of a mixture of h and he which then burns to produce these heavier - element mixtures . in  [ sec : therm ] we consider the effect of the mixing on the thermal profile , and calculate the heating of the ocean due to the convective transport of light elements outwards . finally , in ",

    "again , in order to reach steady state , the base of the ocean must adjust its composition until it is significantly enriched in light elements compared to the composition at the top of the ocean .      to see how the ocean is able to adjust its composition profile to achieve steady state ,",
    "we first note that solid particles crystallize and sediment out rapidly compared to the accretion timescale on which matter is compressed .",
    "the accretion time is @xmath36 or t_accr = 3.2  yrs = 7.2  ( ) ^4/3()^-1  yrs , [ eq : taccr ] where @xmath37 is the pressure scale height , @xmath38 is the column depth , @xmath39 is the local accretion rate per unit area and in the last step we use the fact that the pressure in the ocean is dominated by relativistic degenerate electrons .",
    "we scale to a typical rate @xmath40 ( to set the scale note that the eddington rate is @xmath41 ) .",
    "we choose the gravity @xmath42 corresponding to a @xmath43 , @xmath44 neutron star .",
    "first , consider crystallization .",
    "the nucleation rate , the rate at which solid clusters of a size large enough to be stable are formed , is not currently well understood .",
    "theory typically predicts nucleation rates orders of magnitude smaller than experiment or simulations indicate ( see vehkamki 2006 ) . for an ocp for example , the nucleation rate at @xmath45 from the theoretical model of ichimaru et al .",
    "( 1983 ) is @xmath46 of its value from the simulation of daligault ( 2006b ) .",

    "( 1983 ) results , we find that the amount of undercooling necessary for the nucleation rate to become comparable to the accretion rate is @xmath48 , but given that the theory underpredicts the simulation results , the amount of undercooling required is probably much less than this . additionally , at the base of the ocean solid clusters do not need to wait for nucleation sites to form but can crystallize on the existing crust .",
    "once a cluster forms it increases in size at the crystallization velocity which is of order @xmath49 ( e.g. , kelton , greer , & thompson 1983 ) , where @xmath50 is the mean ion spacing and @xmath51 is the ion plasma frequency given by @xmath52 . in a multicomponent plasma crystal growth",
    "is slower , since as a solid cluster grows chemical separation means that the liquid surrounding the cluster is depleted more and more of the particles necessary to form the solid .",
    "the crystallization rate therefore depends on the rate at which diffusion can replenish the depleted particles . in a liquid with @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the _ average _ coulomb coupling constant , the diffusion coefficient for species @xmath17 is d 8 ( ) ^2/3 _",

    "therefore as soon as the mixture encounters the liquidus line in the phase diagram , we expect solid particles to rapidly form and grow .",
    "once formed , the solid particles will quickly sediment out .",
    "we estimate the sedimentation velocity for solid clusters following bildsten & hall ( 2001 ) and brown et al .",
    "the sedimentation velocity is given by the einstein relation v_sed a_sn_s m_pg , [ eq : vsed ] where @xmath59 is the contrast between @xmath60 for the solid particles and the background fluid .",

    "[ eq : nscrit ] note that the simple nature of our estimates means that there are considerable uncertainties in the crystallization and sedimentation velocities we find here . despite this , however , the timescale for a cluster to grow to a size @xmath66 is so short that the conclusion that the solid particles rapidly fall out of the ocean seems inescapable .    setting @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nscrit ] ) provides an estimate of when relative separation of light and heavy elements ( without forming solid clusters ) is expected to occur .",
    "this gives @xmath68 , below the accretion rates of persistent lmxbs or most transient lmxbs in outburst .",
    "however , separation of light and heavy elements is something that should be considered during quiescent periods in transient accretors ( brown et al . 2002 ) or at low accretion rates ( peng , brown , & truran 2007 ) .      after the solid particles form and sediment out ,",
    "the fluid left behind is lighter than the fluid immediately above it and so will have a tendency to buoyantly rise .",
    "this is counteracted by the thermal profile , which is stably stratified in the absence of a composition gradient such that a rising fluid element will be colder than its surroundings and will tend to sink back down .",
    "a measure of the buoyancy is the convective discriminant @xmath69 , which is related to the brunt - visl frequency @xmath70 ( cox 1980 ) .",

    "we generalize to more than two species in the next section .    in steady state the composition profile is lighter with increasing depth : @xmath86 .",
    "such a profile will not lead to convection as long as the gradient is small enough that the destabilizing effect of the composition profile is compensated by the thermal buoyancy represented by the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a ] ) .",

    "as accretion continues , light elements are continually deposited at the base of the ocean and must be transported upwards by convection .",
    "we expect therefore that the composition gradient will adjust to be close to but slight greater than @xmath88 so as to result in the required convective flux of composition @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the incoming composition and @xmath91 is the composition at the base of the ocean ( that results in freezing of solid with mass fraction @xmath90 )",

    "the mass fraction differs from its surroundings by an amount @xmath96 , implying that there is a flux of composition f_x ~v_conv .",

    "another piece of physics that could potentially play a role is diffusion .",
    "inwards diffusion of composition will occur down the composition gradient @xmath115 , and in principle if efficient enough could mediate the need for convection .",
    "the diffusive flux is much smaller than the convective flux , however . to see this",

    "we also note that our conclusion that the ocean is convectively unstable depends on the slope of the liquidus curve in the phase diagram . in all of the cases",
    "we have considered , the composition profile that would exist if the ocean followed the liquidus curve as fluid elements move to higher pressure is too steep to be maintained by thermal buoyancy .",
    "if this were not the case , a different picture would result : the composition in the ocean at a given pressure would correspond to the composition of the liquidus curve at each depth , and a steady hail of solid particles would fall through the ocean to the solid crust at the base . given the phase diagrams for two- and three - component plasmas we have calculated",
    ", however , this situation appears not to arise .",
    "we therefore expect that the ocean adjusts its composition from @xmath90 at the top to @xmath91 at the base with a mixing zone in which the gradient is @xmath113 . because this gradient is very shallow in the deep",

    "we investigate this in the next section with detailed models of the steady - state ocean , and find that the entire ocean is expected to undergo mixing all the way up to the layer of light elements that supplies the ocean with new material through nuclear burning .",
    "the shallow gradient also means that there is a nearly uniform composition throughout the bulk of the ocean , which is set by the phase diagram at the freezing point .",

    "we have explored the consequences of chemical separation in the ocean of accreting neutron stars . given the rapid timescales for nucleation , growth , and sedimentation of solid particles ,",

    "the conclusions are that the entire ocean is mixed , with a composition gradient @xmath246 $ ] that is very shallow in the bulk of the ocean where the electrons are relativistically degenerate ( @xmath247 ) .",
    "the composition profile is therefore rather uniform and enhanced in light elements compared to the composition produced by nuclear burning of the accreted light elements at the top of the ocean .",
    "for example , for the largest charge ratio we considered , a mixture of o and se , only 2% oxygen by mass was added to the ocean by nuclear burning , but the ocean itself is enriched in steady state to almost 40% by mass of oxygen ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tcp ] ) , set by the phase diagram for the o - se mixture .",
    "accompanying the outwards transport of light elements is an inwards transport of heat . in ",
    "[ sec : therm ] , we argued that the ocean will evolve to a steady - state in which the convective heat flux is balanced by an outwards conductive flux .",
    "the effect of chemical separation is therefore to add a contribution to the outwards conductive heat flux in the ocean , steepening the temperature gradient . for the o - se case",
    ", we find a heat flux of 0.2  mev per nucleon at the base of the ocean , comparable to the flux expected from the crust . the heating is smaller for an fe - se ocean , which has a smaller contrast in composition between the two species .",
    "however , only a small amount of oxygen in the material entering the ocean is required to generate significant heating . in the o - se case we considered ,",
    "only 2% of the incoming mass is oxygen , compared to 40% following enrichment .",
    "therefore , in an ocean consisting of many species , even a small amount of light element entering the ocean could lead to significant heating through its enrichment .",
    "we are currently investigating the phase diagrams of multicomponent mixtures to assess the level of heating in that case .",
    "an immediate application of our results is to superbursts . following horowitz et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and paper i , we chose oxygen as the light element for our example in this paper , but we have calculated models with carbon as the light element with similar results .",
    "carbon enrichment through chemical separation at the base of the ocean , and subsequent upward mixing , could bring the carbon mass fraction @xmath248 at the superburst ignition depth to within the required range @xmath249@xmath237 inferred from observations .",
    "similarly , the heating associated with chemical separation will help to bring the temperature of the ocean up to the required ignition temperatures of @xmath250@xmath251 .",
    "questions still remain , however , such as whether this picture could match the observed recurrence times .",
    "the hotter ocean could also drive a heat flux into the outer crust , explaining the inverted temperature gradient found by brown & cumming ( 2009 ) in cooling transients .",
    "time - dependent calculations of the evolution of the ocean are in progress to address these issues .",
    "compositionally - driven convection is important in cooling white dwarfs as well .",
    "the main difference between convection in the cores of cooling white dwarfs and in the oceans of accreting neutron stars is that in the white dwarf case a given mass element crosses the liquidus curve and crystallizes because the star cools , not because the element is pushed inwards .",
    "the similarities between these two systems are numerous .",
    "for example , the convectively stable composition gradient in the white dwarf interior is @xmath252 , nearly the same as the gradient in the neutron star ocean ; the white dwarf crystallization rate , @xmath253 , is also similar ( mochkovitch 1983 ) .",
    "therefore , we expect that much of our analysis and calculation from the present paper is applicable to the white dwarf case .",
    "another situation in which compositionally - driven convection is important is in the earth s core , in which chemical separation at the boundary between the liquid outer core and solid inner core drives convection in the outer core and provides an energy source for the earth s dynamo ( stevenson 1981 ) .",
    "there are interesting differences between the earth s core and the neutron star ocean , however .",
    "first , the thermal gradient @xmath137 required to carry away the latent heat from the earth s inner - outer core boundary is significant , and exceeds @xmath254 , so that the latent heat drives thermal convection .",
    "second , in the earth s core @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the liquidus temperature gradient ( how the melting temperature varies with pressure ) .",
    "this allows the boundary between the inner and outer core to be at the melting temperature , but the outer core with an adiabatic profile remains above the melting temperature .",
    "therefore a fluid thermally convecting outer core is possible ( loper & roberts 1977 ; stevenson 1980 ; the opposite was proposed by higgins & kennedy 1971 in what became known as the `` core paradox '' ) . in the neutron star ocean , however , @xmath257 : equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) shows that for fixed @xmath27 , @xmath258 so that @xmath259 ; whereas using the results of dewitt & slattery ( 2003 ) to calculate coulomb corrections we find @xmath260 with a weak @xmath27 dependence near the melting point",
    ". this means that the entire ocean could never be thermally convective and remain liquid .",
    "the steady - state convective velocity is larger than the accretion velocity by a factor @xmath261 , where @xmath262 is the required change in composition across the ocean .",
    "because the marginally - stable composition gradient in the ocean is very small , this factor is much greater than unity ; in the deep ocean , this factor is of order 100 .",
    "however , the corresponding velocity is still extremely slow such that additional processes that we have not considered here could change the picture we have put forward . for example , an extremely weak magnetic field ( only about @xmath263 at the base of the ocean ) would have an energy density comparable to the kinetic energy of the flow .",
    "the dipole magnetic fields of accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries are believed to be @xmath264 and stronger horizontal field components would not be surprising , e.g. due to screening currents ( cumming , zweibel , & bildsten 2001 ) or winding due to differential rotation and subsequent instabilities ( piro & bildsten 2007 ) . on a rotating star , eddington - sweet circulation in the ocean would have a timescale @xmath265 where @xmath266 is the break - up spin frequency .",
    "this timescale could be hundreds of days for a thermal time of days at the base of the ocean and @xmath267 , comparable to the convective turnover time .",
    "further work is needed to investigate how rotational circulation or magnetic stresses would affect the models presented here .",
    "the steady state we have been discussing is one in which the unstable composition gradient in the ocean is balanced by the stable temperature gradient , such that the ocean is only marginally unstable to convection .",
    "we find , however , that under certain conditions ( e.g. , @xmath268 ) the top of the ocean is thermally unstable to convection : the temperature gradient must satisfy @xmath269 in order to conduct away the large flux from the crust . in this case , either the convective velocity must be very large at the top of the ocean , or the unstable temperature gradient must be balanced by a _",
    "stable _ composition gradient .",
    "the latter scenario is inconsistent with the two - component models of  [ sub:2cp ] , where the fraction of the light element increases with depth ; but could be consistent with the multicomponent models of  [ sub:3cp ] if the fraction of hydrogen - helium drops faster than oxygen or iron rises .",
    "we are currently studying the time - dependent case to understand what happens when @xmath207 .",
    "in addition to oceans with thermally - driven convection , there are several other scenarios that are likely to lead to interesting time dependence of the mixing zone .",
    "for example , in transients in quiescence ( see , e.g. , shternin et al .",
    "2007 ; brown & cumming 2009 ) the mixing zone relaxes on a timescale comparable to the convective turnover time [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : tconv ] ) ] , about a month in the deep ocean .",
    "mixing also occurs as the star cools after an accretion episode ; the bulk of the ocean will solidify after a few days of cooling and will undergo chemical separation and further convection .",
    "either of these effects could lead to late - time energy release , and provide a further observational test of the conditions in the ocean .",
