    "until recently , the _ quantum chaos theory _ was mainly related to few - body physics . on the other hand , in real physical systems such as many - electron atoms and heavy nuclei ,",
    "the origin of complex behavior is quite strong interaction between many particles . to deal with such systems ,",
    "famous statistical approach has been developed which is based on the _ random  matrix theory _ ( rmt ) ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea of this approach is to forget about a detailed description of the motion and to treat these systems statistically having in mind that the interaction between particles is so complex and strong that generic properties are expected to emerge .",
    "simplest models of the rmt are full random matrices of a given symmetry , the latter was shown to have a direct link with underlying symmetries of physical systems .",
    "one of the main results of the rmt is the prediction of a specific kind of correlations in the energy spectra of complex quantum systems . among many characteristics of these correlations ,",
    "the most popular is the distribution of spacings between nearest energy levels in the spectra .",
    "exact analytical expression of this distribution is very complicated , instead , one uses the so - called wigner - dyson ( wd ) surmise ( quite simple expression which gives a very good approximation to the exact result ) . a distinctive property of this _ wd - distribution _ is the repulsion between neighboring levels in the spectra , the degree of this repulsion ( linear , quadratic or quartic ) depends on the symmetry of random matrices . in fact ,",
    "such type of repulsion was observed experimentally very long ago ( first experimental observation is reported in ref.@xcite for the energy spectra of heavy nuclei ) , and discussed in many theoretical works .",
    "after this prediction of the rmt , the wd - distribution has been confirmed to occur in heavy nuclei and many - electron atoms , see references in @xcite .",
    "later on , it was found also in dynamical systems with chaotic behavior in the classical limit , famous examples are the so - called billiards ( see for example , @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", it was understood that chaotic properties of quantum systems are generic for both disordered models ( when the randomness of matrix elements is postulated from the beginning ) and dynamical systems for which the pseudo - randomness appears as a result of special conditions , the latter are convenient to explain by comparing with the classical limit .",
    "thus , one can say that limiting properties of quantum chaos in the case when all regular dynamical effects are neglected , are described by the rmt .",
    "as one can see , the rmt can give a proper description of a system ( mainly , the properties of energy spectra ) only locally , in a restricted region of energy spectra .",
    "indeed , the rmt can not give any global energy dependence neither for the energy spectrum nor for eigenstates , it is parameter - independent theory . in this sense ,",
    "the conventional rmt ( ensembles of fully random matrices ) is very restricted and , for example , it can not be directly applied to such important phenomena as the localization of eigenstates in disordered models .",
    "this is why new approaches in the rmt have been developed by imposing internal structure of random matrices .",
    "the most known example is the so - called _ band random matrices _ ( brm ) , or random matrices with a band - like structure ( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . inside the band ,",
    "the matrix elements are assumed to be random and independent , and outside the band matrix elements are set to zero .",
    "the brm - ensemble has been recently studied in details both numerically and theoretically , and much is now known about the structure of eigenstates and spectrum statistics for both infinite and finite matrices .",
    "the application of this kind of matrices in physics is very broad . in particular , they have been used to describe dynamical localization in dynamical systems with time - periodic perturbation ( paradigmatic model is the kicked rotor @xcite ) , and the localization of eigenstates in quasi-1d disordered models in solid state physics @xcite .",
    "another class of band random matrices has been introduced very long ago by wigner in ref.@xcite .",
    "the structure of these _ wigner band random matrices _ ( wbrm ) is characterized by the _",
    "leading diagonal _ with reordered ( in an increasing way ) values , plus random and independent off - diagonal elements inside the band of size @xmath0 this type of matrices is much closer to physical realistic systems , compared to the standard full random matrices .",
    "one can suggest that the original motivation of wigner for the study of these matrices was a close correspondence to hamiltonians of complex nuclei , which are typically described by the mean - field part @xmath1 ( leading diagonal ) and the residual interaction @xmath2 of the finite energy range ( off - diagonal matrix elements inside the band ) .",
    "the main interest of wigner was the quantity which nowadays is known as the _ strength function _ or _ local density of states _",
    "this quantity is extremely important when describing the spread of energy , initially concentrated in a specific state of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath1 , between all other states due to the internal interaction @xmath2 . in particular",
    ", it was analytically shown that this function has the form of the lorentzian if interaction is sufficiently ( but not extremely ) large .",
    "this result is fundamental and it is used in very different applications .",
    "however , in spite of the success of the standard rmt  and its modern developments , the strong assumption of randomness of matrix elements , as well as a specific ( band ) structure of matrices do not allow to relate such matrices directly to realistic many - particle hamiltonians .",
    "one of the important reasons is that the underlying structure of realistic hamiltonian matrices results from the single - particle spectrum and _ two - body interaction _ between particles . in order to understand the role of @xmath3body ( random ) interaction ,",
    "a new ensemble of matrices has been suggested ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . in this approach",
    "the matrices arise as a result of construction from the single - particle basis , provided random character of the @xmath3body interaction .",
    "the study of this ensemble of matrices have shown that even when the interaction @xmath2 is very strong and the influence of the leading diagonal may be neglected , there are serious differences from the standard rmt . in particular , it was discovered that for the two - body interaction , @xmath4 , the spectral fluctuations are different from those predicted by the rmt , although the distribution of spacing between nearest levels has the form similar to the wd - distribution .",
    "it was shown that full random matrices occur when the rank of interaction is very large , @xmath5    due to very serious mathematical problems these _ two - body random interaction _ ( tbri ) matrices were forgotten for quite a long time , and only recently they have been used in the context of quantum chaos . in these lectures ,",
    "the author gives a review of recent results obtained for the tbri - model in collaboration with the co - authors .",
    "main attention is paid to a novel approach developed in @xcite , which is based on the chaotic structure of eigenstates in a given basis of unperturbed many - particle states .",
    "this approach allows to relate statistical properties of exact eigenstates in many - body representation directly to properties of single - particle operators , in the first line , to the occupation number distribution of single - particle states .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section 2.1 the structure of the tbri - matrices",
    "is discussed in details .",
    "it was explained how these matrices are constructed from single - particle states and what are properties of matrix elements in many - body representation , also , the comparison is made with full random matrices .",
    "a particular point is that in spite of complete randomness and independence of two - body matrix elements , off - diagonal matrix elements of many - particle hamiltonian matrices have underlying correlations which are due to a two - body nature of interaction .    in section 2.2 generic properties of density of states and level spacing distribution",
    "are briefly discussed , although they are not the main interest of the study .",
    "section 2.3 deals with the structure of exact eigenstates in dependence on the interaction strength and excitation energy .",
    "the notion of the average shape of the eigenstates ( @xmath6_function _ ) is introduced and discussed in details since the structure of chaotic eigenstates plays a basic role in the approach . in next section 2.4 the structure of the strength function",
    "is considered and compared with that of exact eigenstates .",
    "main attention is paid to the conditions under which this form is the lorentzian , and how this form changes with an increase of interaction strength . in section 2.5",
    "very recent analytical results are discussed , which are obtained for the shape of the strength function in the tbri - model for any strength of interaction .",
    "section 2.6 is devoted to non - statistical properties of this model .",
    "specifically , it is shown that some quantities can not be described in a statistical way , in spite of completely random character of the two - body interaction .",
    "next section 3.1 starts with the discussion of the basic relation between the structure of exact eigenstates and the _ distribution of occupation numbers _ ( don ) .",
    "it is shown that the average shape of eigenstates plays a crucial role for this distribution and practically determines mean values of single - particle operators .",
    "in next section 3.2 the relevance of the don for isolated systems , to the standard canonical distribution is discussed .",
    "it is shown how the canonical distribution emerges in isolated systems with an increase of the number of interacting particles . in next section 3.3 the problem of the fermi - dirac distribution",
    "is considered for the tbri - model of interacting fermi - particles , in particular , conditions under which this distribution occurs in isolated systems are analyzed .",
    "an important problem of the statistical description of the occupation number distribution is considered in section 3.4 .",
    "an analytical approach has been developed in order to obtain the don in the case of statistical equilibrium which results from the chaotic structure of eigenstates .",
    "this approach is valid even for small number of particles , in the case when the don differs from the fermi - dirac distribution . in next section 3.5",
    "another approach is suggested for the description of the don , in the case when its form is of the fermi - dirac type .",
    "it was shown how the don can be obtained by a proper renormalization of the total energy of a system , originated from the interaction between particles .",
    "general discussion of the meaning of temperature in isolated systems of finite number of particles is the content of section 3.6 .",
    "the main point is that for small number of particles different definitions of temperature give different results .",
    "therefore , is it of interest to compare these definitions and to understand their meanings , if any .",
    "finally , in section 3.7 main results are summarized for the transition to chaos and equilibrium in the tbri - model in dependence on the interaction strength . in last section 4",
    "it is briefly shown how the developed approach can be applied to dynamical systems .",
    "the model we discuss here deals with hamiltonians which can be separated in two parts , @xmath7 where @xmath8 describes the `` unperturbed '' part and @xmath2 stands for the interaction between particles or between different degrees of freedom . in order to study statistical properties of such models we assume in the following that the interaction is completely random .",
    "in contrast with standard approach of the rmt where matrix elements of @xmath2 are taken as random variables , we would like to keep an important physical property of real systems and to take into account that the interaction is of the two - body nature .",
    "therefore , we start with the single - particle hamiltonian which refers @xmath9 non - interacting particles occupying @xmath10 single - particles levels , and assume that the matrix elements of the _ two - body interaction _ @xmath11 are independent random variables . here ,",
    "the indices @xmath12 indicate initial @xmath13 and final @xmath14 single - particle states coupled by the interaction .",
    "in what follows we consider fermi - particles , however , the approach can be easily extended to bose - particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the slater determinant basis the unperturbed part has simple form @xmath15 and the perturbation can be represented as @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the energy of a particle , corresponding to the single - particle state @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20are creation - annihilation operators . with these notations , exact eigenstates @xmath21 of the total hamiltonian @xmath22 ( _ compound states )",
    "_ can be expressed in terms of eigenstates @xmath23 of the unperturbed part @xmath8 ( _ basis states ) _ as follows     _ @xmath24 _ where _ @xmath25 _ is the @xmath26 component of the compound state _ @xmath27 _ in the unperturbed basis .",
    "these components determine the important quantity which will be discussed in great details below , the _ occupation numbers _",
    "@xmath28 ,    @xmath29    with @xmath30 as the occupation number operator . for fermi - particles the occupation number @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32or @xmath33 depending on whether any of the particles in the basis state @xmath34 occupies or not the single - particle state @xmath18 .",
    "as one can see , our model is described in terms of many - particles basis states @xmath35 and exact ( compound ) states @xmath36 which are constructed from the single - particle states @xmath37 and two - body matrix elements @xmath11 . in what follows",
    "we assume that the basis states are reordered in an increasing way for the total energy @xmath38 with an increase of the index @xmath39 .",
    "this way of the ordering of the unperturbed basis is crucial for the analytical description of chaotic compound states which are formed by the interaction between many basis states , see below .",
    "the size @xmath40 of the basis for the many - particles hamiltonian @xmath22 can be found from the combinatorics : if any single - particle state can be occupied by one particle only , one can get @xmath41 where @xmath10 is the number of single - particle states ( _ orbitals _ ) . the latter estimate in ( [ nsize ] ) shows that total number of many - particle states increases very fast ( exponentially ) with an increase of the number of particles and orbitals .",
    "for example , for @xmath42 and @xmath43 the size of the @xmath44matrix is @xmath45 .",
    "the model with these parameters has been studied in great details in @xcite and compared with direct computations of the ce atom @xcite . for this atom",
    "there are @xmath43 valence electrons , and the core can be effectively described by the hartree - fock method .",
    "this method has been used @xcite in order to calculate the basis set of single - particle relativistic states with energies @xmath17 as well as the matrix elements @xmath11 of interaction between valence electrons .",
    "the ce atom is known to have good statistical properties , and this was the reason in @xcite to compare direct calculations with the simplest model ( [ h],[h0],[v ] ) we are going to discuss . in spite of the fact that this model does not take into account the momentum ( it depends only on the energy and for this reason can be treated as `` zero - dimensional '' , it turns out to be instructive for the comparison of the real ( _ dynamical _ ) ce atom with the two - body random interaction model ( _ tbri - model _ ) described above ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "in what follows , for the single - particle energies @xmath17 we take a non - degenerate spectrum with constant mean level spacing @xmath46 which , without the loss of generality can be taken @xmath47 .",
    "the unperturbed single - particle spectrum has been chosen at random , or according to the expression @xmath48 ( the results are statistically the same ) .",
    "as one can see , the model is defined by four parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath50 which is the variance of two - body random matrix elements ( we assume that the distribution of these elements is the gaussian with the zero mean ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) with ( [ h0 ] ) and ( [ v ] ) is of general form , it appears in many physical applications such as when describing complex atoms , nuclei , atomic clusters etc .",
    "in fact , the form of @xmath22 discussed above is known as the _ mean field approximation _ for complex quantum systems of interacting particles . in this description , the unperturbed part @xmath8 represents the zero - order mean field for the excited states with the ground state @xmath51 , and the _ residual _ two - body interaction is given by @xmath2 . therefore , the single - particle levels @xmath17 in such applications are , in fact , renormalized quasi - particle energies ( see details , for example , in @xcite ) .",
    "the considered here model does not take into account such physical effects as momentum dependence , pairing effects and others , however , it contains the main effects of quantum chaos and is very effective for the understanding generic features of complex systems .",
    "moreover , as was pointed out , the approach we discuss below , can be extended for _ dynamical _ quantum systems which exhibits _",
    "complex behavior_.    from the view point of dynamical systems when the complexity of the behavior appears as a result of _ dynamical chaos _ ( both for the systems with or without _ the classical limit _ ) , the separation of the total hamiltonian in two parts is well defined physical procedure .",
    "specifically , the approach is expected to be valid if the second part @xmath2 is as `` random '' as possible . in other words",
    ", one should find such separation that the perturbation has no strong regular part , the latter should be embedded into the `` unperturbed '' hamiltonian @xmath8 . in this way , the compound states may be treated , for sufficiently strong perturbation , as chaotic superposition of simple basis states .",
    "as is well known , such a situation is typical for many - electron atoms and heavy nuclei .",
    "indeed , the number of basis states ( number @xmath52 of _ principal components _ ) is known to be about @xmath53 for excited nuclei , and @xmath54 in excited rare - earth or actinide atoms .    by assuming the complete randomness of two - body elements in our models , we avoid the influence of any regular effects .",
    "therefore , our goal is to explore statistical properties of the model in its strongest `` chaotic '' limit .",
    "one should stress that the answer is far from being trivial since the many - body hamiltonian @xmath22 turns out to be quite different from standard random matrix ensembles of the rmt and , as will be shown , some important quantities can not be described statistically .    it should be noted that the tbri - model we discuss here , for the first time was analyzed long ago ( see @xcite , also , the review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the original interest was related to the fact that for standard random matrices the density of states has the famous _ semicircle _ form , in contrast with physical systems for which the rmt was addressed ( complex nuclei ) . moreover , the density of states for many - body systems increases very fast , and has nothing to do with the semicircle even on a local scale .",
    "therefore , the natural question is to understand what is missed in the rmt .",
    "for this reason , another ensemble of matrices has been suggested which takes into account @xmath3body interaction between particles .",
    "the theoretical study has been shown that , indeed , fully random matrices of the kind considered in the standard rmt , formally correspond to the case @xmath55 .",
    "on the other hand , with decrease of @xmath23 , the density of states tends to the gaussian form .",
    "the latter form is closer to reality and on a local scale , the density may be treated as the realistic one .",
    "another question which has been under close investigation , is the role of @xmath23-body interaction on the spectrum statistics , see discussion below .",
    "for some reason , these studies have not been extended until recently , when the role of two - body interaction in different applications was questioned in the context of quantum chaos .",
    "unlike the previous studies , below we pay the main attention to chaotic properties of eigenstates , and to the problem of how these properties can be linked to the properties of single - particle operators , such as the _ occupation number _ _",
    "distribution_.      let us start with the structure of the hamiltonian @xmath22 in the chosen basis .",
    "for this , one should construct matrix elements @xmath56 which correspond to the coupling between basis states @xmath21 and @xmath57 due to the interaction @xmath2 .",
    "one can immediately see that the number @xmath58of independent matrix elements @xmath11 of the two - body interaction is much less than the total number @xmath59 of the ( symmetric ) matrix elements @xmath60 .",
    "it is very important that due to a two - body character of the interaction , the matrix elements @xmath60 are non - zero only when basis states @xmath21 and @xmath61 differ by no more than two occupied single - particle states . in order to count the total number @xmath62 of non - zero matrix elements @xmath60 for the fixed @xmath63",
    ", we separately count the numbers @xmath64 of non - zero matrix elements which correspond to the transition between the basis states which differ by the positions of none , one and two particles , respectively , @xmath65 as a result , the total number @xmath62 in each line of the matrix is @xmath66 where the last estimate is given for large number of particles and orbitals , @xmath67 . comparing @xmath62 with @xmath68 defined by eq.([nsize ] ) , one can see that the matrix @xmath22 is _ sparse _",
    "( only for @xmath69 there is no forbidden transitions and the matrix is full ) .",
    "the presence of many zeros in the matrix means that , in a sense , there are strong correlations between matrix elements since the position of zeros are fixed for any random choice of the two - body random matrix elements .",
    "it should by pointed out that the sparsity increases with an increase of the number of particles , therefore , the more particles ( and orbitals ) , the less relative number of non - zero elements .",
    "this fact is important for the description of such systems by the random matrix approach .",
    "one should remind that in the standard rmt , the _ sparsity _ is not taken into account at all .",
    "the sparsity of the matrix for @xmath42 and @xmath43 is shown in fig.1 where black points correspond to non - zero elements .",
    "first , one can see that the density of zero elements increases when moving away from the principal diagonal .",
    "second , the positions of non - zero matrix elements are correlated , there are some curves along which the density is high , this reflects the two - body nature of interaction .",
    "in contrast with full random matrices of the standard rmt , the influence of the off - diagonal elements depends on the distance from the principal diagonal . to illustrate this peculiarity",
    ", we averaged the modulo of the off - diagonal matrix elements over blocks of the fixed size @xmath70 in such a way that instead of the matrix of the size @xmath71 we have the reduced size @xmath72 .",
    "the result is shown in fig.2 where only off - diagonal terms are presented .",
    "as one can see , the amplitude of these effective matrix elements decreases when moving away from the diagonal .",
    "this means that the effective intensity of the off - diagonal terms far from the diagonal is less than of those close to the diagonal . in some sense",
    ", one can treat the structure of the hamiltonian as the _ band - like _ , although it is clear that the amplitude of the averaged matrix elements decays quite slowly .",
    "now , let us analyze non - zero off - diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath60 .",
    "according to the definition ( [ v ] ) , any of these elements is just a sum of one or more two - body matrix elements .",
    "when the basis states @xmath73 and @xmath57 differ by one occupied orbital , @xmath74 , the matrix element @xmath60 is the sum of @xmath75 two - body matrix elements , @xmath76 here the last equality is given in order to show that among other matrix elements @xmath77 there are such elements which differ from @xmath60 by the last term only and the sum of @xmath78is exactly the same @xcite , @xmath79 with @xmath80 .",
    "this happens for those basis states whose many - particle energies differ by the energy difference corresponding to the move one particle from the orbital @xmath81 to the orbital @xmath82 , @xmath83 one can see that these matrix elements , strictly speaking , can not be treated as completely independent variables .",
    "therefore , if one averages over the ensemble of matrices @xmath60 which constructed from different sets of two - body random elements , the correlations for such elements remain , @xmath84 .",
    "the more striking result arises when considering matrix elements @xmath60 which correspond to the coupling between those basis states @xmath73 and @xmath57 which differ by two occupied orbitals , @xmath74 .",
    "these matrix elements are equal to the corresponding single two - body matrix elements , in other words , there is only one term in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) , @xmath85 .",
    "these matrix elements correspond to the move of two particles from the orbitals @xmath86 to other orbitals @xmath87 . at the same time",
    ", the rest of particles ( @xmath88 particles ) can occupy different @xmath89 orbitals .",
    "therefore , the same matrix element stands for other basis states @xmath90 and @xmath91 with the same move of two particles , thus , @xmath92 . as a result , among matrix elements of the hamiltonian matrix @xmath60",
    "there are equal matrix elements , although they are chosen randomly from the ensemble of two - body random matrices .",
    "this non - trivial fact indicates that , in spite of completely random character of the two - body interaction , the ( non - zero ) matrix elements of the many - body hamiltonian are not completely independent variables !",
    "the role of the above underlying correlations which are due to a two - body character of the interaction , is an interesting and important problem ( see @xcite ) , we will discuss some results in section 2.6 . here",
    ", we would like to show that these correlations can be easily detected by the study of the distribution of matrix elements @xmath60 . for this ,",
    "let us take the ensemble of the hamiltonians @xmath93 with different two - body random matrix elements @xmath94 keeping all other parameters .",
    "then , for any fixed values @xmath63 and @xmath95 , we can find numerically the distribution of non - zero matrix elements @xmath96 .",
    "finally , we normalize each of these distributions to their variances and make the summation .",
    "the resulting normalized distribution is shown in fig.3 .",
    "the envelope of this distribution looks like the gaussian , however , the deviations are _ non - statistical _ ones which can be easily seen by the @xmath97-test ( for some bins of the histogram , the difference is more than @xmath98 standard deviations ) .",
    "as was pointed out , the density of states @xmath99for the two - body random model was found to have the gaussian form @xcite .",
    "rigorous proof is given for the limit case of a very large number of particles and orbitals .",
    "however , even for relatively small values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 the distribution is very close to the gaussian , see fig.4 .",
    "it is known that the density of realistic physical systems such as complex atoms and heavy nuclei can be approximated as @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the ground energy .",
    "therefore , the simplest model of the two - body interaction does not give exact correspondence to a real density , however , it reproduces very fast increase of the density with the energy .",
    "one should note that for full random matrices of the standard rmt , the density has the semicircle form which is very far from the reality .",
    "it is clear that in order to compare statistical properties of our hamiltonian @xmath96 with those of complex quantum systems , one should use the left part of the energy spectrum since the decrease of the density in the right part is due to artificial cut - off of the single - particle spectrum ( finite values of @xmath10 ) .",
    "the interesting question is about the type of fluctuations in the energy spectrum of the tbri - model in comparison with those predicted by the rmt .",
    "a particular interest is the distribution of normalized spacings @xmath102 between nearest energy levels . for standard random matrices",
    "the rmt reveals specific kind of the distribution known as the _ wigner - dyson distribution_. in particular , for symmetric real random matrices ( the so - called , gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices ) , the level spacing distribution @xmath103 with a high accuracy can be described by the following form , @xmath104 where @xmath105 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for the limit case of a very strong interaction , when one can neglect the influence of the mean field ( or , the same , without the leading diagonal in the hamiltonian @xmath60 ) , the form of @xmath106 turns out to be quite close to the expression ( [ ps ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , when studying the distribution of spacings between the levels @xmath107 and @xmath108 with @xmath109 , the difference between the result of the rmt and the tbri - ensemble is noticeable and increases with @xmath23 .",
    "this means that the level spacing distribution @xmath106 is quite insensitive quantity of spectral correlations and does not `` feel '' the difference of tbri - matrices from the full random matrices .    in physical applications ,",
    "the interaction @xmath110 is typically of the same order as the `` unperturbed '' hamiltonian @xmath8 since in the mean field approximation the term @xmath8 absorbs regular part of the interaction and @xmath111 is the ( chaotic ) part of the interaction which can not be included in @xmath112 .",
    "however , there are many cases when the interaction is weak compared to @xmath113 , therefore , the important question is how spectral fluctuations , in particular , the level spacing distribution , depend on the interaction and on total energy @xmath107 .",
    "the origin of the wigner - dyson distribution ( [ ps ] ) is related to the onset of chaos in the exact eigenstates ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in standard random matrices",
    "the wd - distribution occurs for any energy since all eigenstates are completely random ( their components are distributed according to the gaussian distribution for large size of the matrices ) .    experimental data for complex atoms @xcite,@xcite and heavy nuclei @xcite ( see also references in @xcite ) agree with the wigner - dyson statistics .",
    "the wd - distribution has been also observed in numerical calculations for the ce atom @xcite and the nuclear shell - model @xcite .    in the tbri - model",
    ", the randomness of the components of eigenstates is different for different eigenstates .",
    "this fact influences the spectrum statistics if one average over a large part on energy spectrum . in fig.5",
    "the level spacing distribution for the tbri - model is shown for the parameters which may be compared with the ce atom thoroughly studied in @xcite , @xmath114 .",
    "the average over @xmath115 different matrices @xmath96 has been done in order to have representative statistics .",
    "all but @xmath116 levels from the spectrum edges have been taken into account . by searching the structure of eigenstates",
    ", one can see that all eigenstates seem to be quite random ( see examples below ) .",
    "however , one can detect clear non - statistical ( regular ) deviation from the wd - distribution which should be treated as quite strong , having in mind insensitive character of @xmath117 .",
    "this result may be regarded as an indication of not strong enough interaction between particles .",
    "detailed study of the onset of the wd - distribution in the tbri model has been recently performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our main interest in this section is in the structure of exact eigenstates .",
    "the choice of the unperturbed basis , reordered in increasing energy , allows us to understand what happens with an increase of the interaction . in the standard perturbation theory the natural parameter which controls",
    "the intensity of the perturbation is the ratio @xmath118 of the interaction to the mean level spacing @xmath119between the unperturbed energy levels .",
    "since the value of @xmath119 is defined by the total density of states , @xmath120 , one can expect that our control parameter is @xmath121 .",
    "however , in @xcite it was shown that due to a two - body character of interaction , the correct parameter is different . indeed , in the first order of the perturbation theory , the interaction couples not all unperturbed states but those basis states which correspond to the shift of not more than two particles .",
    "this means that the density of states which are coupled by the two - body interaction is much less than the total density @xmath122 .",
    "therefore , the correct mean level spacing @xmath123 that has to be compared with the interaction @xmath124 , is much larger than @xmath125 .",
    "if the interaction is very weak , @xmath126 , the standard perturbation theory can be applied . in this case",
    "any of the eigenstates in the unperturbed basis has the form of the delta - function ( originated from the unperturbed state @xmath127 ) plus small admixture of other components with amplitudes decreasing as @xmath128 , therefore , the _ number of principal components _ is small , @xmath129 .",
    "in this case one can speak about _ perturbative localization _ of eigenstates in the unperturbed basis .",
    "this situation is quite typical for eigenstates corresponding to low energies , in the energy region where the density of states is small .    with an increase of perturbation ( or when passing to higher eigenstates for the fixed @xmath130 )",
    ", the number @xmath52 of principal components with essentially large amplitudes @xmath131 increases and can be very large , @xmath132 , even if @xmath124 is less than @xmath133 .",
    "such a situation occurs when @xmath134 , see details in @xcite .",
    "in such a case the structure of eigenstates is `` chaotic '' , however , there are many `` holes '' inside such eigenstates in a given basis . therefore , in spite of large number of components , these _ sparse eigenstates _ are non - ergodic , which leads to _ non - gaussian statistics_. namely , the fluctuations of the components @xmath135 can be extremely large and statistical description is not valid .",
    "one should stress that in this case the number of principal components can not be estimated as @xmath136 , as is typically assumed in the literature ( here @xmath137 is an effective `` size '' of the eigenstates in unperturbed energy representation , see below ) .",
    "when the interaction is relatively strong , @xmath138 , specific transition occurs from non - ergodic to ergodic eigenstates .",
    "this transition has been discovered in @xcite by considering the flow of the energy in the fock - space of excited states .",
    "for very large number of particles this transition is sharp and may be compared with the anderson transition in solid state models ( see for example details in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the condition @xmath139 can be considered as the transition to chaos inside compound eigenstates , thus , allowing to describe the model in a statistical way , see below .",
    "an example of such chaotic eigenstates is given in fig.6 for the parameters related to the ce atom .",
    "one can see that for large excitation energy ( @xmath9 is the number of exact eigenstates reordered in increasing energy @xmath140 ) , the eigenstates look more extended ( delocalized ) in the unperturbed basis .",
    "it is interesting to note that they look very similar to the eigenstates of the ce atom , obtained in the direct quantum computation based on the hartree - fock method @xcite .",
    "for the first time , chaotic structure of eigenstates of the ce atom has been revealed in @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss how to quantitatively characterize chaotic eigenstates .",
    "first , we introduce the matrix @xmath141 constructed from the exact eigenstates @xmath142 corresponding to the energy @xmath140 . in",
    "what follows , we use the notations which refer low indices to the basis states , and upper indices to the exact ( compound ) eigenstates .",
    "thus , the structure of eigenstates is given by the dependence @xmath143 on @xmath95 for fixed values of @xmath9 .",
    "on the other hand , if we fix the index @xmath95 and explore the dependence @xmath144 on @xmath9 , one can understand how the unperturbed state @xmath57 is coupled to other basis states due to the interaction .",
    "the latter quantity is very important since it gives the information about the spread of the energy , initially concentrated in a specific basis state @xmath145 when switching on the interaction .",
    "the envelope of this function @xmath144 in the energy representation is known as _ strength function _ or _ local spectral density of states _ ( ldos ) and will be discussed in details in next section.@xmath146    from fig.6 one can conclude that when the number of principal components is large , @xmath147 , such eigenstates may be treated as random superposition of components @xmath148 , although they do not occupy the whole unperturbed basis .",
    "the gaussian character of the fluctuations of @xmath149 depending on the indices @xmath95 or @xmath9 , has been revealed in @xcite for the ce atom , thus allowing to treat the exact eigenstates of a dynamical systems , as _",
    "chaotic eigenstates_.    the size of the basis which they occupy can be associated with the `` size '' of eigenstates , or , with the _ localization length_. as is known , the notion of the localization length is very important in solid state applications , when studying the eigenstates of disordered models in infinite basis in the position representation . in such applications the localization length @xmath150 is defined via exponential decrease of the square of the amplitude of eigenstates . for the finite basis",
    ", the definition of the localization length can be generalized in a way described in @xcite .",
    "following to @xcite we define here two localization lengths , namely , the `` _ entropy localization length _ '' @xmath151 , and the localization length @xmath152associated with the so - called _ participation ratio_. the first one is defined by the expression @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the mean `` _ entropy _ '' of eigenstates , @xmath155 and @xmath156 is the normalization constant which is equal approximately to @xmath157 in the case of pure gaussian fluctuations of @xmath158 ( see details e.g. in @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath159 is the number of eigenstates which are taken for the average .",
    "this can be the number of eigenstates of one matrix @xmath60 taken from a small energy window , or the number of eigenstates for the fixed @xmath9 , computed from different matrices @xmath96 with different realization of disorder in two - body matrix elements .",
    "the second definition is commonly used in solid state applications ( see e.g. @xcite ) . assuming the gaussian character of fluctuations of the components of eigenstates , the localization length @xmath160 is defined by @xmath161 in the above expressions ( [ lh ] , [ lipr ] ) the factors @xmath157 and @xmath162",
    "are , in fact , normalizing coefficients which provide , in the limit case of completely extended and gaussian eigenstates in the finite basis of the size @xmath40 , the `` maximal '' value of the localization length @xmath163 . in other extreme case of a strong ( exponential ) localization in the unperturbed basis , the above two localization lengths are proportional to that found from the tails of eigenstates ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of the localization lengths @xmath151 and @xmath160 on the basis number and energy of exact eigenstates is given in fig.7a - b .",
    "the average over @xmath164 matrices @xmath60 with different realizations of two - body matrix elements has been taken , in order to smooth strong fluctuations in the value of localization lengths of individual eigenstates .",
    "the above definitions of localization length can be taken for the estimate of a number of principal components @xmath52 , and can be associated with the degree of `` chaoticity '' of compound eigenstates .",
    "the data of fig.7 show quite good correspondence with direct computations @xcite performed for the ce atom , for which the localization length @xmath151 was found to be about @xmath165 . comparing fig.7b with fig.4 of the density of states @xmath166",
    ", one can see the similarity .",
    "this fact can be understood from the simplest estimate of @xmath52 as a total number of ( basis ) states defined by the `` width '' @xmath167 , the latter can be approximated as the mean - square - root of the distribution @xmath143 for the fixed @xmath9 , @xmath168 one should stress that this expression is valid for ergodic eigenstates ( @xmath169 ) and shows the proportionality of @xmath52 to the density . as for the width @xmath137",
    ", it is approximately independent of the excitation energy , see below .",
    "eq.([entropy ] ) reflects general relation between the number of principal components @xmath52 and the _ entropy of eigenstates _ , @xmath170 where @xmath171 stands for any reasonable definition of the entropy . in application to shell models of complex nuclei",
    "this relation has been studied in great details in @xcite . combining eq.([sef ] ) with eq.([npcg ] ) , one can get @xmath172 in contrast to the density of states , the width @xmath173 is a weakly dependent function of the energy .",
    "therefore , the entropy @xmath174 found from exact eigenstates practically coincides with the thermodynamical entropy , the fact which was mentioned for the first time in @xcite .      in this section",
    "we discuss the properties of the _ strength function _ which is defined as @xmath175 here @xmath148 are the components of eigenstates @xmath142 (  compound  states ) of the total hamiltonian @xmath22 given in the unperturbed basis @xmath57 , and @xmath140 is the energy associated with the state @xmath142 . the sum is taken over a number of eigenstates @xmath176 chosen from a small energy window centered at the energy @xmath177 .",
    "one can see that this function @xmath178 is originated from the same matrix @xmath143 which has been introduced in previous section when discussing the structure of exact eigenstates .",
    "indeed , an exact eigenstate is characterized by the dependence @xmath179 on @xmath95 for the fixed value @xmath9 ( associated with the energy @xmath180 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the strength function is characterized by the same function @xmath143 when index @xmath95 is fixed and we are interested in the dependence on the energy @xmath181 due to the relation between @xmath182 and @xmath9 therefore , @xmath183 here we have introduced the @xmath6_function _ @xmath184 which gives the envelope of @xmath143 in dependence on the indices @xmath95 and @xmath9 ( the bar stands for the average inside small windows centered at @xmath95 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "in fact , the strength function is the ( smooth ) representation of a ( simple ) basis state @xmath57 in terms of exact eigenstates .",
    "this function is very important since it can be measured experimentally .",
    "it contains an information about the internal interaction between unperturbed states .",
    "namely , it shows how the unperturbed state @xmath57 is coupled to the exact states @xmath142 due to the interaction .",
    "an effective width of this function ( _ spreading width _ ) defines the energy range associated with the `` life time '' of an unperturbed state @xmath142 if initially one excites specific basis state .    in solid state models",
    "the role of the unperturbed energy in eq.([ldos ] ) plays the position @xmath95 of an electron and the function @xmath185 has the meaning of the electron density of states for the fixed position @xmath95 . for this reason",
    "this function is known in solid state physics as the _ local density of states _ ( ldos ) .",
    "one can see that if ( apart from fluctuations ) @xmath143 is independent of the position ( or , in our application , the energy of compound state ) , it reduces to the total density of states , @xmath186 .also , if the total density of states is constant , @xmath187 @xmath188 , the dependence of the ldos on @xmath95 is of the form @xmath189 .",
    "this means that the form of the ldos is the same for any @xmath95 . in our case of strong dependence of the density of states on the energy ,",
    "the form of the ldos is quite complicated , see next section .",
    "normalized to the mean energy level spacing , the strength function @xmath190 determines an effective number @xmath52 of principal components of compound states @xmath191 which are present in the basis state @xmath192 .",
    "similar to the analysis of the structure of the eigenstates in dependence on the interaction , one can understand that for a very weak interaction @xmath193 the ldos  is a delta - like function with a very small admixture of other components which can be found by the standard perturbation theory . with an increase of the interaction , the number of principal components increases and",
    "can be very large .",
    "however , if the interaction is not strong enough @xcite , @xmath194 the ldos  is sparsed , with extremely large fluctuations of components , see details in ref.@xcite . in order to have ergodic ldos , one needs to have the perturbation large enough , @xmath195(for a large number of particles this transition is sharp and , in fact , one needs the weaker condition , @xmath196 , see details in @xcite ) .    for",
    "@xmath197 the ldos  turns out to be ergodic and thransition to chaos occurs @xcite , therefore , statistical description of the model is valid .",
    "few examples of the ldos for the tbri - model are given in fig.8 for the parameters of the ce atom .",
    "one can see strong dependence of the shape of the ldos  on the position of basis state @xmath198 in the energy spectrum .",
    "before we start with the discussion of analytical results , it is important to point out the correspondence between the shape of the ldos , and that of exact eigenstates which have been discussed in previous section .",
    "specifically , from the analysis of the structure of the eigenstate matrix @xmath199 one can expect the similarity between the ldos  and shape of the eigenstates .",
    "for the first time such a similarity has been observed when studying band random matrix ensembles @xcite .",
    "moreover , the detailed study of some dynamical models @xcite have revealed that even when the shapes of the ldos and efs seem to be completely different , after a proper rescaling which involves both unperturbed and perturbed energy spectrum , both shapes are very similar . in order to compare characteristics of the ldos  and",
    "efs , in fig.9 the dependence of the entropy localization length on the energy is shown for both the ldos  and efs . apart from strong fluctuations ( which are due to a chaotic nature of the components @xmath148 ) , in general , the dependencies @xmath200 look very similar .",
    "the problem of the correspondence between shapes of the ldos and efs is still open , however , from the studies made up to now ( see also @xcite ) , one can conclude that if the width of the perturbed spectrum is of the same order as the unperturbed one ( or , the same , the perturbation is not very larger ) , one can expect that both shapes are very close to each other .",
    "the importance of this problem of similarity for the shapes of the ldos and efs will be clear in next section when we discuss the relation between the shape of the ef and generic properties of the occupation number distribution .",
    "for the first time the form of the ldos in random matrix theory has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where band random matrix ensemble has been considered .",
    "the matrices were assumed to consist of the diagonal part @xmath8 in the form of reordered numbers @xmath201 ( thus , the unperturbed level density is constant , @xmath202 ) , and the perturbation @xmath130 with the random independent off - diagonal matrix elements for @xmath203 . outside the band of size @xmath204 matrix elements are zeros .",
    "the distribution of the off - diagonal matrix elements is characterized by the zero mean , @xmath205 and the variance @xmath206 for this model , the relevant parameter was found to be    @xmath207    wigner analytically proved @xcite that for relatively strong perturbation , @xmath208 in the limit @xmath209 ( when the influence of the main diagonal @xmath210 is strong ) the form of the ldos is the lorentzian ,    @xmath211    which is nowadays known as the _ breit - wigner _ ( bw ) form .",
    "here @xmath212 is the spreading width which is half - width of the distribution ( [ bw ] ) , @xmath213 and the energy @xmath214 refers to the center of the distribution . in other limit",
    "@xmath215 the influence of the unperturbed part @xmath1 can be neglected and the shape of the ldos  tends to the shape of the total density of states of band random matrices without the leading diagonal @xmath216 , which is the semicircle .",
    "recently , the shape of the ldos has been studied rigorously for a more general distribution of the off - diagonal elements @xmath217 in the wigner band random matrix model ( wbrm ) .",
    "namely , the variance of random matrix elements is taken to depend on the distance @xmath218 from the principal diagonal according to an envelope function @xmath219 which , for @xmath220 , decreases sufficiently fast ( see details in @xcite ) . in this case the effective band size @xmath221 is defined by the second moment of the function @xmath219 .",
    "another important generalization of ref.@xcite is related to the sparsity inside the band , which can be defined as a relative number of zero elements in each line of the matrix . as was shown above ,",
    "such a sparsity , which is due to the two - body nature of the interaction between the particles , is important for statistical properties of compound states .",
    "the bw - form of the ldos also occurs in a more general model describing the interaction of an unperturbed state with a large set of complex states , see details in the book @xcite .",
    "it also appears for dynamical systems with complex behavior , such as the ce atom @xcite , the @xmath222 shell model @xcite , as well as in random models in application to solid state physics @xcite .    for a long time",
    "it was believed that the ldos for complex physical systems has the universal energy dependence described by the bw - distribution ( [ bw ] ) . however , when studying the structure of the ldos  and efs of the ce atom , it was observed some deviation from the bw - shape for large distance from the center . by applying the wbrm , in @xcite",
    "it was analytically shown that the shape of the ldos is highly non - universal for energies larger than the effective size of the band in the energy representation , @xmath223 ( in what follows by @xmath224 we mean the distance from the center @xmath225 of the distribution , @xmath226 ) , see also numerical data in @xcite .",
    "namely , outside this range , the tails of the ldos are highly non - trivial , decaying very fast ( even faster than the exponent ) when @xmath227 .",
    "therefore , the range of parameters for which the form of ldos has the bw - form in the wbrm - model , is given by the condition @xcite which can be written as    @xmath228    here , the left - hand - side of the inequality is related to non - perturbative character of the coupling since the perturbation should couple many unperturbed states .",
    "the condition ( [ range2 ] ) turns out to be of generic and can be applied to real physical systems .",
    "moreover , it can be used to find the effective band - width @xmath229 of interaction when other definitions of @xmath221 are obscure . in the tbri - model with many interacting particles the band - width is very large ( practically it is infinite ) , and does not play any role in many solid state applications . on the contrary , in application to complex atoms and nuclei",
    ", the number of particles above the fermi level is relatively small ( four particles in the ce atom and 12 particles in the @xmath230 shell models ) , and this effect can be important .",
    "it should be pointed out that the bw - dependence has infinite second moment . at the same time , in any physical application the second moment is always finite and is defined by the sum of the square of the off - diagonal elements .",
    "this fact results in non - lorentzian tails of the ldos .",
    "the important question is about the shape of the ldos for a strong interaction , when the condition ( [ range2 ] ) violates , @xmath231 . since in the mean field approximation the `` regular '' part of the interaction",
    "is included in the mean field , very often the interaction @xmath2 is compared with the unperturbed part @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , this situation when the shape of the ldos  is very different from the bw - form , is quite physical . in order to understand what happens in this case , it is useful to study how the transition from the bw - form to the semicircle occurs in the wbrm - model . as was pointed out ,",
    "the semicircle form itself is unphysical and appears when neglecting the unperturbed part @xmath8 .",
    "however , the form of the ldos in the transition region seems to be of quite generic .",
    "numerical data in refs.@xcite,@xcite for the wbrm - model have shown that for the case when @xmath232 the form of the ldos can be approximately described by the gaussian .",
    "the same fact has been observed and discussed in refs.@xcite when studying eigenstates and ldos for shell model of nuclei . since in the latter application",
    "the band size of the interaction is not well defined , it is better to introduce one more parameter , in addition to the half - width @xmath233 .",
    "as was shown in ref.@xcite , in general , the form of the ldos can be effectively described by two independent parameters , @xmath234 and @xmath235 where the latter is defined via the variance of the ldos , @xmath236 in the symmetric case ( in the tbri - model , at the center of the spectrum ) , @xmath225 coincides with the unperturbed energy , @xmath237 .",
    "then , if the parameter @xmath238 is much less than @xmath239 , the shape @xmath240 of the ldos is the bw - dependence ( [ bw ] ) and @xmath238 has the meaning of the half - width of the distribution @xmath241 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath242 , the form of the ldos is approximately the gaussian , @xmath243 detailed numerical study @xcite of the form of the ldos in the region @xmath242 have shown that the ldos  coincides with the gaussian with a very high accuracy .",
    "it is important to stress that in this case , the parameter @xmath238 has nothing to do with the half - width @xmath244 of the ldos , the latter is proportional to the mean - square - root @xmath245 of the gaussian , @xmath246 ( see also discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "note that the gaussian form typically occurs in `` statistical spectroscopy '' @xcite when neglecting the mean field term @xmath8 in eq.([h ] ) .",
    "one should note that sometimes the fact that the ldos can deviate from the bw - form due to the influence of the finiteness of @xmath235 , is missing in the literature .",
    "it is important that the center and variance of the ldos can be explicitly expressed via diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements respectively @xcite .",
    "indeed , the center is defined by@xmath247 @xmath248 where the relation @xmath249 is used for exact eigenstates .",
    "correspondingly , the variance can be obtained from the matrix elements of @xmath250 , @xmath251 for the tbri - model the sum of the off - diagonal elements for any fixed value of @xmath252 can be evaluated exactly @xcite , @xmath253 where the expressions ( [ k123 ] ) have been used for @xmath254and @xmath255 , and @xmath256 is the variance of the off - diagonal matrix elements .",
    "one can see that with an increase of the interaction , the half - width of the ldos changes from the quadratic dependence @xmath257 to the linear one , @xmath258 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the variance of the ldos for fermi - particles does not depend on the index @xmath95 which stands for a specific basis state , therefore , @xmath259      very recently , the form of the ldos for the tbri - model has been analytically found in @xcite for any strength of perturbation . in this section",
    "we discuss the approach of @xcite and the obtained results .",
    "we would like to stress that our aim is to find the ldos in terms of matrix elements of the total hamiltonian @xmath60 , without its diagonalization . to start with ,",
    "let us rewrite the general expression for the ldos in the form    @xmath260    where @xmath261 is the total energy of the system ( energy of an exact eigenstate ) .",
    "as was pointed out , the @xmath6function gives the shapes of both exact eigenstates and strength functions depending on what is fixed , the total energy @xmath262 or the unperturbed one , @xmath263 .",
    "the method used in @xcite is an extension of the approach developed in @xcite , which takes into account specific structure of the hamiltonian tbri - matrix .",
    "specifically , first , we fix some basis component @xmath35 and diagonalize the hamiltonian matrix without this component .",
    "then the problem is reduced to the interaction of this component with exact eigenstates @xmath264 which are statistically described by the matrix components @xmath265 . in the spirit of the approach of ref.@xcite",
    "let us introduce a small energy window @xmath266 which will be used for an average over the total energy inside this interval . as a result , the set of equations for the ldos can be written in the following form , @xmath267 where @xmath268 is some function which can be associated with the half - width of the distribution @xmath269 , for the case when the energy dependence is weak , @xmath270 .",
    "the energy shift @xmath271 for the basis state @xmath34 , @xmath272 is due to the asymmetry of the perturbation , if the energy @xmath273is not at the center of the spectrum .",
    "this shift is just the modified second order correction to the unperturbed energy level . for the calculation of the shape of the eigenvector @xmath274 one should substitute the exact energy @xmath275",
    "then , if the interaction is not very strong , in the evaluation of the above equations the difference @xmath276 can be neglected .",
    "one should stress that the summation in the above equations is performed over exact states .",
    "since the exact eigenstates are unknown , one should express everything in terms of the basis states only . to do this , we express exact eigenstates @xmath274 through the basis components , @xmath277 in previous sections",
    "it was argued that for large number of principal components , @xmath278and sufficiently strong interaction @xmath196 , the components @xmath279 can be treated as random variables , therefore , the second term in ( [ vki ] ) vanishes after averaging .",
    "substitution of eq .",
    "( [ vki ] ) into eqs.([gamma ] , [ delta ] ) gives @xmath280 @xmath281 where the integral is taken as the principal value .",
    "last equality is valid in the approximation of slow variation of @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "the equations for @xmath284 and @xmath285 allow to calculate the strength function ( [ ffbw ] ) from the unperturbed energy spectrum and matrix elements of the total hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "now we have the set of equations ( [ ffbw],[gammaf],[deltaf ] ) which , in principal , give the solution for the ldos @xmath286 and can be solved numerically . however , for relatively large number of particles ( practically , for @xmath287 ) , one can find an approximate analytical solution of the problem @xcite . by analyzing these equations , in @xcite",
    "it was proved that the condition of the self - consistent solution for the ldos ( or the same , when the shape of the ldos exists as a smooth function of the energy ) , is just the condition for the onset of chaos in the tbri - model , @xmath288 , discussed in previous sections .",
    "more specifically , for a very strong interaction , @xmath289 the number @xmath290 of effectively large terms in the sums is large , @xmath291 , fluctuations of @xmath137 are small , @xmath292 and eq .",

    "the matrix element @xmath386 , otherwise , it is zero .",
    "therefore , in fact , the sum in ( [ sd ] ) is a single sum , with a number of items less than @xmath40 , @xmath387 where the sum @xmath388 runs over the specified @xmath63 .",
    "analogously , eq . ( [ sc ] ) can be written as the double sum over @xmath63 and @xmath95 specified as above , @xmath389 where @xmath390 is a function of @xmath95 , @xmath391 .",
    "note that the energies of the basis states and their primed partners are connected as @xmath392 .",
    "one can expect that maximal values of the sum ( [ ssd ] ) and ( [ ssc ] ) correspond to the terms for which @xmath393components are principal components of the eigenstates .",
    "this means that mean square of the matrix element @xmath394 is maximal when the operator @xmath395 couples the principal components of the state @xmath396 with those of @xmath397 , i.e. for @xmath398 @xmath399 .",
    "far from the maximum ( @xmath400 ) a principal component of one state , say , @xmath401 , is coupled to a small component @xmath23 of the other state @xmath402 ( @xmath403 . the latter case is simpler to consider analytically , since the admixture of a small component in the eigenstate can be found via the standard perturbation theory .",
    "this approach reveals the origin of the correlations in the sum @xmath380 , eq .",
    "( [ ssc ] ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath404 is a small component of the eigenstate @xmath405 , then it can be expressed as a perturbation theory admixture to the principle components .",

    "since the basis states @xmath416 and @xmath417 must differ by the same two orbitals , we have @xmath418 ( note that @xmath419 , since both states @xmath384 and @xmath413 contain @xmath420 and do not contain @xmath82 , whereas @xmath416 and latexmath:[$%    @xmath81 ) .",
    "therefore , the averages over the non - zero matrix elements between such pairs of states give @xmath422 .",

    "this means that it indeed suppresses the transition amplitudes off - resonance ( see figs.13 - 14 ) .",
    "for @xmath440 the ratio @xmath441 approaches its limit value @xmath442 .",
    "it is easy to obtain from eq .",
    "( [ final ] ) that for @xmath443 @xmath444    thus , surprisingly , the role of the correlation contribution increases with the number of particles .",
    "this result is supported by numerical data reported in ref.@xcite . in fig.14",
    "one can see that the suppression of the matrix elements @xmath445 due to the correlation term at the tails , is quite strong , numerical ratio is @xmath446 vs. @xmath447 obtained from eq.([final ] ) ; this should be compared with the case @xmath448 for which numerical value is @xmath449 see details in @xcite .",
    "the correlation contribution should be even more important in compound nuclei , where @xmath450 .",
    "this case can be modeled by the parameters @xmath451 , @xmath452 ; then we have @xmath453 , or , equivalently , @xmath454 , which means that the correlations suppress the squared element @xmath455 between compound states by a factor of @xmath162 ( far from its maximum ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the existence of correlations due to the perturbation theory admixtures of small components to the chaotic eigenstates , which leads to a non - zero value of @xmath380 ( [ ssc ] ) , is indeed non - trivial .",
    "for example , if one examines the sum of eq .",
    "( [ ssc ] ) as a function of @xmath63 and @xmath95 , it would be hard to guess that the sum itself is essentially non - zero , since positive and negative values of @xmath456 seem to be equally frequent , and have roughly the same magnitude , see fig.15 .",
    "however , in spite of apparent random character of the terms @xmath457 , its mean value turns out to be non - zero and is of the same order as the diagonal term @xmath381 . since @xmath458 ( see below ) , the suppression of @xmath459 at the tails should be accompanied by correlational enhancement of the matrix elements near the maximum ( for @xmath460 ) .",
    "thus , we come to the important conclusion : even for a random two - body interaction , the correlations produce some sort of a `` _ correlation resonance _ '' in the distribution of the squared matrix elements @xmath461",
    ". one should note that this increase of the correlation effects in the matrix elements of a perturbation can be explained by the increased correlations between the hamiltonian matrix elements when the number of particles and orbitals increases ( @xmath462 .    in a similar way one can estimate the size of the correlation contribution @xmath463 near the maximum of the @xmath464 distribution ( at @xmath465 @xcite . @xmath466 ~.\\ ] ] comparing the values of the ratio @xmath467 at the maximum and at the tail in fig.13 ( @xmath468 ) , one can see that indeed , @xmath469 . for larger @xmath9 and @xmath10 the correlation enhancement factor asymptotically reaches its maximal value of @xmath470 .",
    "this numerical example shows the enhancement of @xmath471 with respect to @xmath381 at the maximum even greater in size than that predicted by eq .",
    "( [ estimate ] ) .",
    "this is not too surprising since in eqs .",
    "( [ bw])([estimate ] ) we estimated the average value of @xmath472 over an interval @xmath473 around the maximum rather than the peak value at the maximum .",
    "let us now come back to the distribution of occupation numbers defined by eq.([ns ] ) .",
    "it gives the probability that one of @xmath9 particles occupies an orbital @xmath474 specified by the one - particle state @xmath18 , for the fixed exact ( compound ) state @xmath264 . according to this expression ,",
    "this probability can be found by projecting the state @xmath264 onto the basis of unperturbed states , for which the relation between the positions of all particles in the single - particle basis and specific many - particle basis state is known by the construction of the latter .",
    "one can see that the probability @xmath475 is the sum of probabilities over number of basis states which construct the exact state . for fermi - particles ,",
    "only one particle can occupy an orbital , this is why the occupation number @xmath476 or @xmath340 .",
    "it is clear that for chaotic eigenstates the @xmath477distribution is a fluctuating function of the total energy @xmath478 of a system , due to fluctuations of the components @xmath25 of eigenstates . in order to obtain a smooth dependence",
    ", one should make an average over a small energy window centered at @xmath479 , which is in the spirit of conventional statistical mechanics for systems in the contact with the thermostat .",
    "in fact , such an average is a kind of microcanonical averaging since it is done for the fixed total energy @xmath261 of a system .",
    "therefore , in what follows , by the @xmath477_distribution _ we assume the averaged distribution , @xmath480 where the @xmath6function discussed in previous section is used .",
    "we are going to show that the @xmath477 distribution plays essential role in the statistical approach to finite systems of interaction particles .",
    "our interest to this quantity is of two - fold .",
    "first , the knowledge of the distribution of occupation numbers gives the possibility to calculate mean value of any single particle operator @xmath481 .",
    "here @xmath482 are diagonal matrix elements of a single - particle operator @xmath366 , which very often can be found easily since they refer single - particle physics . for quantum systems with complex behavior ,",
    "the non - trivial part is the @xmath6function which absorbs the result of the two - body interaction between many basis states .",
    "the important point is that in order to find the distribution of occupation numbers , there is no need to know exactly eigenstates of the system . instead",
    ", the shape of eigenstates in the energy representation is needed , which is defined by the @xmath6function .",
    "thus , if we know this function and properties of the unperturbed system , one can relate statistical properties of chaotic systems to single - particle quantities .",
    "moreover , the variance of the distribution of non - diagonal elements of @xmath159 , describing transition amplitudes between `` chaotic '' compound states due to a weak external perturbation , can be also expressed through to the occupation numbers @xmath28 .",
    "this variance is important from experimental point of view , for example , for the estimate of an enhancement of a weak interaction ( which refers , for example , the parity violation in atoms and nuclei ) , see details in @xcite .",
    "second , the form of the distribution of occupation numbers is interesting itself .",
    "one of important questions which arises in this respect , is whether the standard fermi - dirac and bose - einstein distributions occur for isolated systems of finite number of particle .",
    "if they occur , then , under what conditions and how they can be described ? one can suggest that the role of the interaction between particles is crucial since this is the only reason to result in a complex behavior ( chaos ) of a system , and the latter is the mechanism for the statistical equilibrium .",
    "another non - trivial question relates to the meaning of temperature for isolated systems .",
    "the study of the @xmath477distribution gives a new insight on these and other problems .",
    "for the analytical treatment it is convenient to represent the @xmath477distribution in the following form , @xmath483 here the function @xmath484 is the part of the @xmath6function , which non - trivially depends on the difference @xmath485 between the unperturbed energy @xmath263 only .",
    "namely , we omitted the normalization term @xmath486 since the summation in eq.([nalpha ] ) runs over the unperturbed energy , @xmath487 .",
    "thus , the denominator appears due to the normalization .",
    "this form ( [ nalpha ] ) allows one to introduce a kind of the _ partition function _ ,",
    "@xmath488 which is entirely determined by the shape of chaotic eigenfunctions .    the above expression ( [ nalpha ] ) gives a possibility of the statistical description of complex systems .",
    "indeed , as was mentioned above , the shape of the @xmath6 function has universal features and can be often described analytically .",
    "therefore , in practice there is no need to diagonalize huge hamiltonian matrix of a many - body system in order to find statistical averages .",
    "we would like again to stress that the summation in ( [ nalpha ] ) is carried out over unperturbed energies @xmath263 defined by the mean field , rather than over the energies of exact eigenstates in the standard canonical distribution . as a result",
    ", the distribution of occupation numbers can be derived analytically ( see below ) even for few interacting particles , in a situation when the standard fermi - dirac distribution does not occur .",
    "let us now compare the @xmath477distribution ( [ nalpha ] ) with occupation numbers given by the standard _",
    "canonical distribution _",
    "@xcite , @xmath489 here @xmath490 is the temperature of a heat bath and the index @xmath63 stands for exact eigenstates .",
    "the important difference between the @xmath477 distribution ( [ nalpha ] ) and the canonical distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) is that in eq .",

    "the nondiagonal matrix elements of the interaction are not taken into account , one can expect that the distribution of occupation numbers defined by these equations gives a correct result if the interaction is weak enough ( ideal gas approximation ) .",
    "however , below it will be shown that , in fact , even for strong interaction the fermi - dirac distribution can be also valid if the total energy @xmath261 is rescaled in a proper way , by taking into account the increase of the temperature due to statistical effects of the ( random ) interaction .",
    "one should also note that the above consideration is similar to the standard derivation ( see e.g. @xcite ) of the fermi - dirac distribution from the canonical distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) for the case of many non - interacting particles ( ideal gas ) .",

    "the distribution of occupation numbers has been derived without any reference to the temperature , from the @xmath6function and properties of the unperturbed system",
    ". however , the @xmath477distribution in fig.16 seems to have a fermi - dirac form .",

    "in such a derivation , the presence of the thermostat is assumed , actually , in order to have statistical equilibrium in the system .",
    "indeed , for an isolated systems with large @xmath591 , any extremely weak interaction with an environment results in strong statistical properties of a system . using modern language",
    ", one can speak about the _ onset of chaos _ due to this interaction .",
    "in fact , the weakness of the coupling to the heat bath gives the possibility to treat the gas of particles as an ideal gas .",
    "it is well known , that in this case one can write the following equations , @xmath592 where @xmath9 and @xmath224 are total number of particles and total energy , and @xmath28 is assumed to have fermi - dirac form , @xmath593    when in an isolated system described by the tbri - model , the number of particles is very large , the above equations result in the fd - distribution , see section 3.3 .",

    "it was argued that in the case of random interaction , this term absorbs statistical increase of the energy and gives the correct result for the @xmath477distribution .",
    "in fact , this assumption is based on a deep equivalence between the _ external chaos _ originated by the heat bath in the case of open systems , and _ internal chaos _ due to a random character of the interaction .",
    "therefore , it was assumed that random interaction and chaos in closed systems plays the role of a heat bath .    in order to find analytically the shift @xmath600",
    ", one needs to consider the structure of exact eigenstates in the unperturbed basis , in particular , to find the shift between the energy of an exact eigenstates and the mean energy of the components of the same eigenstate @xcite .",
    "since the density of states rapidly increases with the energy @xmath261 , the number of higher basis states admixed to an eigenstate due to the interaction is larger than the number of lower basis states . as a result , the mean energy @xmath601 of the components in an exact eigenstate @xmath21 is higher than the eigenvalue @xmath479 corresponding to this eigenstate ( we consider here the eigenstates in the lower part of the spectrum ) .",
    "there is another effect which decreases the value of @xmath602 , see ( [ eki ] ) , which remains even if the density of states does not depend on the energy .",
    "this second effect is due to repulsion between energy levels , according to which the eigenvalues move down for this part of the spectrum , therefore , the difference between @xmath602 and @xmath603 increases due to the interaction .",
    "the second effect also shifts the `` center '' of the @xmath6function .",
    "one should stress that all effects leading to the above shift of the energy are automatically taken into account in the relation ( [ eki ] ) .",
    "thus , one can analytically calculate this shift @xmath604 from the equation ( [ eki ] ) . for this",

    "thus , to find correct values for the occupation numbers in the fermi - dirac distribution , we should solve eqs.([newfd ] ) with @xmath599 defined by eq.([delfinal ] ) .",

    "the comparison of these data ( circles in fig.20 ) with eq .",
    "( [ delfinal ] ) ( straight full line ) shows reasonable agreement , if to neglect strong fluctuations around the global dependence .",
    "these fluctuations are due to fluctuations in the components of specific exact eigenstates @xmath36 ( note , that the presented data correspond to individual eigenstates , without any additional averaging ) .",
    "in previous section it was shown that if the @xmath477distribution for finite number of particles in the tbri - model has the from of the fermi - dirac distribution , it can be found from the modified eq.([newfd ] ) .",
    "these equations also determine the parameters @xmath607 and @xmath608 which may be associated with the `` _ chemical potential _ '' and `` _ temperature _ '' for an isolated system .",
    "one can see , that due to the shift @xmath609 of the total energy in eq.([newfd ] ) , there is a corresponding shift of the temperature @xmath610 .",
    "it is important to note that in systems with infinite number of particles , all definitions of temperature give the same result .",
    "in contrast to this , for finite number of particles different definitions give different results .",
    "let us , first , start with the standard definition of temperature ,    @xmath611    where @xmath612 is the thermodynamical entropy ,    @xmath613    and @xmath614 is the density of states .",
    "in fact , this definition of the _ thermodynamical temperature _ stems from the estimate of the position of maximum of the canonical averaging function @xmath615 , see ( [ fi ] ) , if we assume that the position of its maximum @xmath616 coincides with the energy @xmath261 of a system .",
    "one should stress that in the above definition @xmath614 is the total density of states , therefore , the interaction is essentially taken into account .",

    "the averaging is performed over the canonical distribution ( [ gibbs ] ) . since the width @xmath513 of the canonical averaging function @xmath504 is not zero , the two definitions of the temperature , ( [ ttnew ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) give , in principal , different values .",
    "indeed , in the case of the gaussian form of @xmath614 the value of @xmath618 given by ( [ ttnew ] ) takes the form ( see also @xcite ) , @xmath619 where @xmath225 and @xmath297 are the center and the width of the total density @xmath620    on the other hand , direct evaluation of the relation ( [ energy ] ) leads to the following definition of the _ canonical temperature _ , @xmath621 here , the shift @xmath266 is approximately given by the expression @xmath622\\ ] ] where @xmath623 one can see that the shift @xmath266 itself depends on the temperature , it is proportional to the width @xmath624@xmath297 of the function @xmath625 . in the above expressions , @xmath626 and @xmath627 are the low and upper edges of the energy spectrum . note that the relation @xmath628 occurs at the center of the spectrum , therefore , at the center the temperature diverges and in the upper part of the spectrum is negative .",
    "this fact is typical for systems with bounded spectrum , for example , for spin systems .",
    "in fact , the tbri - model ( [ h ] ) with finite number @xmath10 of orbitals can be treated as a model for one open shell in atoms , nuclei , clusters , etc . however , in realistic many - body systems there are always higher shells which contribute to the density of states for higher energy .",
    "thus , the density of states @xmath614 is a monotonic function which results in the positive temperature .",
    "for such physical applications , the model ( [ h ] ) with finite number of orbitals is reasonable in the lower part of the energy spectrum where the influence of higher shells can be neglected .",
    "one can also see that the difference between the two equations of state @xmath629 defined by eqs.([ttherm ] ) and ( [ tcan ] ) , disappears for highly excited eigenstates ( for which @xmath630 or in large systems with @xmath535 .",

    "since it is directly related to the shift of total energy , @xmath639 , one can get , @xmath640 therefore , statistical effects of random interaction can be directly related to the increase of temperature of a system , @xmath641 .",
    "one of the important questions deals with thermodynamical description of isolated systems of interacting particles . in any thermodynamical approach",
    "one needs to define , in a consistent way , such quantities as entropy , temperature and equation of state .",
    "this problem has been recently discussed @xcite in application to shell models of heavy nuclei . in particular , it was shown that for a realistic residual interaction different definitions of temperatures give the same result .",
    "let us now summarize the discussed above results for the tbri - model in what concerns transition to chaos and thermalization .",
    "the latter term is not defined for isolated systems , our suggestion is to treat `` _ thermalization _ '' as the onset of _ statistical equilibrium_. the latter allows to give a reasonable statistical description and may be used to find thermodynamical description .",
    "depending on the strength of ( two - body ) interaction between particles , one can fix different situations in the model . first region ( i ) refers _ strong ( perturbative ) localization .",
    "_ this occurs when the interaction is very weak , @xmath126 and standard perturbation theory gives correct result . in this case",
    "exact eigenstates have only few relatively large components ( @xmath642 , in other words , the eigenstates are strongly localized in the unperturbed basis .",
    "this situation is quite typical for lowest eigenstates ( where the density of states is small ) even if for higher energies the eigenstates can be considered as very `` chaotic '' ones ( @xmath643 .",

    "sparsed_. as a result , the number of principal components can not be estimates as @xmath646 , as is typically assumed in the literature . in this case the energy width @xmath137 of both the ldosand eigenstates can be approximately describe as @xmath647 . in fig.17",
    "it is shown how the distribution of occupation numbers @xmath28 looks like for the tbri - model ( [ h ] ) with @xmath43 particles and @xmath42 orbitals and very weak perturbation @xmath648 .",
    "one can see that the distribution of occupation numbers has nothing to do with the fermi - dirac distribution ( full diamonds ) , it turns out to be even the non - monotonic function of the energy @xmath17 of orbitals ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "note that the averaging procedure used in fig.17 can not wash out strong fluctuations in occupation numbers @xmath28 .    with further increase of the interaction , where @xmath147 and @xmath649 , the region ( iii ) of the _ statistical equilibrium _ emerges .",
    "in this region the fluctuations of eigenstate components @xmath25 are of the gaussian form @xcite and one can introduce the @xmath6function ( [ nalpha ] ) as the shape of exact eigenstates in the unperturbed energy basis .",
    "correspondingly , the fluctuations of the occupations numbers @xmath28 are small in accordance with the central limit theorem , @xmath650 for @xmath651 .",
    "one should stress that in this region the value of @xmath52 is given by the common estimate , @xmath652 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath477distribution changes slightly when changing the energy of a system .",
    "such a situation can be naturally related to the _ onset of thermal equilibrium _ , though the form of the distribution @xmath28 can be quite different from the fermi - dirac distribution . in this case",
    ", the @xmath6distribution allows for a correct description of an actual distribution of occupation numbers in isolated quantum systems of interacting particles .",
    "one can see that the equilibrium distribution for the occupation numbers arises for much weaker condition compared to that needed for the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "since the energy interval @xmath123 between directly coupled basis states is small , it is enough to have a relatively weak residual interaction @xmath653 in order to have the equilibrium distribution ( note , that the value of @xmath123 decreases rapidly with the excitation energy ) .",
    "next region ( iv ) is where the _ canonical distribution _ ( [ gibbs ] ) occurs ; for this case in addition to the equilibrium , one needs to have large number of particles , @xmath654 if , also , the condition @xmath655 is fulfilled , the standard fermi - dirac distribution is valid with a proper shift of the total energy due to the interaction , see section 3.5 . typically , this region is associated with the onset of the canonical thermalization ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in practice , the condition ( iv ) of the canonical thermalization is not easy to satisfy in realistic systems like atoms or nuclei since @xmath9 in the above estimates is , in fact , the number of `` active '' particles ( number of particles in a valence shell ) rather than the total number of particles . thus , the description based on the @xmath6distribution ( [ nalpha ] ) which does not require the canonical thermalization condition ( iv ) , is more accurate .",
    "the above statements are confirmed by the direct numerical study of the two - body random interaction model @xcite with few particles when changing the interaction strength @xmath656 if , instead , we increase the number of particles keeping the interaction small , @xmath657 , the distribution ( [ nalpha ] ) tends to the fermi - dirac one as it is expected for the ideal gas , see @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have discussed a novel approach to isolated systems of finite number of interacting particles .",
    "the goal of this approach is a direct relation between the average shape of exact eigenstates ( @xmath6function ) , and the distribution @xmath658of occupation numbers of single - particle levels . from this relation",
    "one can see that there is no need to know exactly the eigenstates , instead , if these eigenstates are chaotic ( random superposition of a very large number of components of basis states ) , the @xmath6function absorbs statistical effects of interaction between particles and determines the form of the @xmath477distribution .",
    "therefore , the structure of chaotic eigenstates in dependence on the model parameters , is the central question in this approach .",
    "the results discussed above relate to the tbri - model for which all two - body matrix elements are assumed to be random and independent variables .",
    "this assumption was made in order to study limiting statistical properties of this model .",
    "in particular , it was shown that even in this limit case of completely random ( two - body ) interaction , the hamiltonian matrix in many - particle representation can not be treated as the random matrix , therefore , the rmt is , strictly speaking , not valid . however , under some conditions exact eigenstates turn out to be quite random and statistical approach is correct , however , one should take into account the form of eigenstates in a given basis of unperturbed part @xmath8 .",
    "another reason for the study of this tbri - model , is that it is very convenient for the demonstration of the developed approach . in this case",
    "there are no any effects of regular motion in the system , and many of analytical estimates can be obtained in a clear way . in particular ,",
    "it was shown how to calculate the @xmath477 distribution from the shape of eigenstates , provided the unperturbed spectrum of energy is known .",
    "one can stress that in this way one can analytically obtain the @xmath477distribution which can have the form very different from the standard fermi - dirac distribution . on the other hand , for sufficiently large interaction",
    "the @xmath659distribution is of the fermi - dirac form , therefore , it is convenient to introduce an effective `` temperature '' and `` chemical potential '' which give correct description of actual @xmath477distribution in terms of the fermi - dirac distribution . to do this",
    ", one needs to find the shift of the total energy which formally comes into equations determining the fd - distribution .",
    "one should stress that this shift is directly related to the @xmath6function and can be found analytically .",
    "now , we would like to point out that the approach discussed in this paper for the tbri - model is of generic and can be applied both for random and dynamical interaction .",
    "one of the most interesting problems is the application of the approach to dynamical systems with the well - defined classical limit . in this situation",
    "exact eigenstates in the corresponding quantum model can be expected to appear when two conditions are fulfilled .",
    "the first one is the strong chaos in the classical counterpart , and the second is the semi - classical limit ( which is typically equivalent to a high energy of a system ) . under these two conditions , eigenstates of quantum model",
    "have many components and these components may be treated as pseudo - random , thus leading to a statistical equilibrium in the system and possibility to apply the suggested approach .    in refs.@xcite two quantum dynamical systems have been studied and compared to their classical limits . in both cases the main results refer the region of parameters where the classical motion is strongly chaotic .",
    "one of the important questions which was under close investigation is the quantum - classical correspondence for the @xmath6function and the ldos . as was pointed out in ref.@xcite , there is a quite clear and easy way for finding _",

    "the interaction between particles is embedded in @xmath662which is assumed to result in chaotic behavior of the ( total ) system .",
    "note that the same consideration is valid if instead of particles we mean different degrees of freedom for one particle .",

    "since the total hamiltonian is chaotic , there is no problem with the choice of initial conditions @xmath665 , any choice gives the same result if one computes for sufficiently large time .",
    "when time is running , let us collect the values of _ unperturbed _ hamiltonian @xmath666 for fixed values @xmath667 and construct the distribution of energies @xmath668 along the ( chaotic ) trajectory of the _ total _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath22 .",
    "in such a way , one can get some distribution @xmath669 . comparing with the quantum model",
    ", one can see that this function @xmath670 is the classical analog of the @xmath6function which is the average shape of eigenstates in energy representation .",
    "indeed , any of exact eigenstates corresponds to a fixed total energy @xmath671 and it is represented in the unperturbed basis of @xmath8 , in fact , @xmath6function is the ( average ) projection of exact eigenstate onto the set of unperturbed ones .",
    "thus , one can expect that for chaotic eigenstates in a deep semiclassical region the two above quantities , classical and quantum ones , correspond to each other .",
    "on the other hand , one can consider the complimentary situation .",
    "let us fix the _ unperturbed _ energy @xmath101 and compute a trajectory @xmath672 which belongs to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath673 similar to the previous case , let us put this unperturbed trajectory into the total hamiltonian @xmath663 and collect the values of total energy @xmath674 along the unperturbed trajectory for discrete values of time . in this way one can find the distribution @xmath675 which now should be compared with the ldos in the corresponding quantum model .",
    "however , in this case one should be careful and make an average over many initial conditions @xmath665 with the same energy @xmath676 , if the unperturbed hamiltonian is regular .",
    "in fact , the above two classical distributions @xmath677 and @xmath675 determine the ergodic measure of energy shells , the first one , when projecting the phase space surface of @xmath93 onto @xmath8 , and in the second one , the surface of @xmath1 onto @xmath22 ( see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "numerical data for two different dynamical models have shown amazingly good correspondence between the @xmath6function and the ldos , and their classical counterparts , see details in refs.@xcite .",
    "recently , few other systems have been studied both in classical and quantum representations , and again , very good correspondence has been numerically found in the semiclassical region .",
    "these data confirm the theoretical predictions , and seems to be very important in view of future developments of the semiclassical theory of dynamical chaotic systems .",
    "it is important to point out that the above correspondence opens a new way for the _ semi - quantal _ description of quantum system , when the form of the @xmath6function is taken from a classical model and used in order to find distribution of occupation numbers @xmath658of single - particle levels in the corresponding quantum system @xcite .",
    "another interesting problem which has been studied in dynamical systems , is the distribution of occupation numbers and the possibility of its analytical description in the same way as it was done for the tbri - model ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most interesting results obtained numerically , is that the canonical distribution occurs in an isolated ( dynamical ) system of only two interacting spin - particles , if one randomize the _ non - zero elements _ of the interaction @xmath2 as close as possible to the dynamical constrains of the model .",
    "this means that random interaction indeed plays a role of the heat bath and allows to use statistical and thermodynamical description for isolated systems .",
