    "the high lattice thermal conductivity @xcite of two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene and other carbon nanostructures has stimulated intensive studies to understand phonon transport in them @xcite .",
    "apart from holding great prospects for thermal management applications in nanoelectronic devices , graphene also serves as a benchmark for investigating fundamental questions regarding thermal transport in low - dimensional systems .",
    "anomalous thermal transport , such as logarithmic divergence of thermal conductivity with respect to system size , has been long predicted for 2d lattice models @xcite and it has been debated whether or not this divergence can occur in graphene @xcite .",
    "it has also been predicted that hydrodynamic phonon transport can occur in graphene in a much wider temperature range than in three - dimensional materials @xcite .",
    "moreover , effects of external conditions such as strain on the thermal transport in graphene have also attracted much attention @xcite .",
    "because of the small anharmonicity in graphene , lattice dynamics methods based on perturbative treatments @xcite have been successfully used to study thermal transport in graphene . on the other hand , molecular dynamics ( md ) based methods , which are nonperturbative , are also a valuable tool , especially in cases where the lattice dynamics - based methods are difficult to apply .",

    "there have been intensive efforts in developing md - based methods for studying spectrally decomposed properties @xcite , but most of them are targeted for general materials .",
    "one exception is the method by gill - comeau and lewis @xcite , where the total thermal conductivity is decomposed into a single - particle component and a collective one , the latter being crucial to materials in which the non - resistive normal ( non - umklapp ) scattering is important , which is the case for graphene @xcite .    here",
    ", we introduce an extension to the emd and nemd methods which is particularly useful for 2d materials . specifically , we decompose the microscopic heat current into in - plane and out - of - plane parts , which are connected directly to the dynamics of the in - plane and the out - of - plane ( flexural ) phonons .",
    "simulations based on this decomposition allow us to elegantly explore the effective time and length scales of phonon transport in strained as well as in unstrained graphene .",
    "our results suggest that the thermal conductivity in unstrained pristine graphene is finite but diverges logarithmically when a sufficiently large tensile strain is applied . combining the in - out decomposition and spectral decomposition ,",
    "we find that the acoustic flexural phonon branch is responsible for the divergence of the thermal conductivity in pristine graphene under uni - axial tensile strain .",

    "our results show clearly that the slow convergence of the thermal conductivity is due to the flexural phonons : the convergence of @xmath85 takes a few ns , while @xmath86 converges within a few hundred ps .",
