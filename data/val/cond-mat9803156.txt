    "bloch oscillations@xcite of a quantum state in a periodic one - dimensional structure can be characterized as an _",
    "response to a _ constant _ force .",
    "the phenomenon is a remarkable example of the counter - intuitive nature of quantum mechanics .",
    "not only does the particle oscillate in response to a static and homogeneous force , but the amplitude of the oscillation is _ inversely _ proportional to the magnitude of the force .    the prototypical system in which to observe bloch oscillations ( bo ) has historically been a band electron in an external electric field.@xcite in the absence of inelastic scattering and interband ( zener ) transitions , the electron , in momentum space , continually traverses the brillouin zone . upon reaching a zone boundary ,",
    "the electron is reflected to the opposite boundary and thereby reverses its momentum . in real space ,",
    "the motion is likewise periodic  a constant force thus produces oscillatory motion .",
    "but the existence of bo has been controversial ever since its theoretical prediction many decades ago ( ref .",
    "contains an early review ) .",
    "the controversy surrounding the theory was largely concerned with the use , or rather the misuse , of bloch s theorem in systems where the lattice periodicity was explicitly broken by a constant external field .",
    "experiments were not conclusive because , in these early times , bulk solids were the only systems available .",
    "their bandwidths , however , are typically too large , the lattice constants too small , and the inelastic scattering so frequent that the phase coherence of the particle state , essential for the existence of bo , is rapidly destroyed .",
    "however , with the advent of semiconductor heterostructures  in particular layered superlattices with large lattice constants , and thus small bandwidths , which allow many coherent bo before phase coherence is lost  the debate about bo seems to be settled .",
    "recent experiments now provide convincing evidence that bo of electrons can indeed occur .",
    "this confirmation comes from the detection of the coherent radiation emitted as ensembles of electrons execute bo.@xcite there is also work which directly measures the physical displacement of electrons in superlattices as they oscillate.@xcite    the search for bo has not been limited to electrons .",
    "recently , the effect was observed with ultra - cold atoms placed in an optical standing wave.@xcite the standing wave served as the periodic potential , and a force was simulated by accelerating this periodic potential .",
    "the momentum distribution of the atoms had the time dependence expected from the theory of bo .",
    "current studies of bo are moving beyond the establishment of their existence . in atom - optical systems ,",
    "bo are being used to test other aspects of quantum theory .",
    "for example , nonexponential decay of unstable systems was very recently observed in the same systems used to observe bo and the wannier - stark ladder.@xcite in electronic systems , bo are being studied as a means of producing fast emitters of coherent radiation .",
    "the radiation emitted by the oscillating charges can be tuned over a wide range of frequencies simply by changing the electric field strength .",
    "typical wavelengths are in the submillimeter range .    an entirely different class of systems in which such coherence phenomena can be expected",
    "are magnetic systems , which brings us to the main subject of this work .",
    "it has been pointed out recently that bo should exist in purely magnetic systems  in the quantum dynamics of domain walls with soliton - like behavior.@xcite this proposal for magnetic bo was based on a semiclassical treatment@xcite of the quantum dynamics of extended domain walls moving in a periodic potential and containing a large number of spins @xmath2 , with @xmath3 . in the present work , we shall extend this investigation to the fully quantum mechanical regime of anisotropic spin-1/2 chains and demonstrate that bo occur in the quantum dynamics of elementary excitations such as spin solitons .",
    "such solitons represent the extreme limit of a magnetic domain wall with a width of only one lattice constant .",
    "in contrast to the cases mentioned above ( electrons and atoms ) , magnetic bo are an inherently many - body effect . the soliton motion is a cooperative phenomenon resulting from spin - spin interaction .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that magnetic bo share many properties with their electronic counterpart .",
    "a remarkable feature of magnetic bo is that they give rise to oscillations of the magnetization at a bloch frequency which can be continuously varied by an external magnetic field .",
    "thus , besides being of fundamental interest , bo of magnetic solitons may also prove relevant for applications since they provide a natural source of _ magnetic _ dipole radiation  typically in the microwave regime .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define and discuss the one - soliton approximation in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath4 applied along the easy axis , thereby extending the zero - field results obtained previously for antiferromagnets ( afms)@xcite and for ferromagnets ( fms).@xcite we show that the external @xmath4 field localizes the eigenstates of the bloch band and discretizes the spectrum into a set of equally spaced levels which we call the wannier - zeeman ladder ( wzl ) , in analogy to the wannier - stark ladder in electronic systems .",
    "we mention several spin - models capable of supporting bo , but our main focus is on ising - like fm chains with biaxial anisotropy  a model which accurately describes compounds such as@xcite @xmath5 .",
    "we then go on to discuss the spin correlation functions and calculate the wave vector and frequency dependent dynamical structure factor @xmath0 for two cases : zero and finite magnetic fields . for finite magnetic fields ,",
    "the structure factor consists of peaks at frequencies corresponding to integer multiples of the bloch frequency .",
    "these frequencies are typically in the ghz range .",
    "this result means that , for example , neutron scattering measurements on samples in thermal equilibrium can be used to observe the wzl .",
    "in zero magnetic field , we obtain a structure factor for fms that is very similar in form to the one obtained for afms,@xcite apart from a wave - vector dependence that reflects the difference in magnetic ordering between fms and afms . after a brief digression on the @xmath6 limit",
    ", we turn to an investigation of specific materials which are promising candidates in which to observe bo of magnetic solitons .",
    "we focus on one particular ising - like fm,@xcite @xmath7 , which appears to be the best characterized of the ones we have identified .",
    "other materials , though less well characterized , are potentially better candidates",
    ". finally , we close with a summary of the main results , along with an outlook on future directions .",
    "in the following we concentrate on one - dimensional ising - like magnets with nearest - neighbor exchange interactions @xmath8 and in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "the general anisotropic spin hamiltonian is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes lattice sites and @xmath12 denotes cartesian coordinates .",
    "the exchange constants @xmath8 are either positive ( fms ) or negative ( afms ) , with @xmath13 . thus , the ( ising ) easy - axis is along the @xmath14-axis . in systems with such a strong easy - axis , domain walls , or solitons ( we shall use these terms interchangeably ) ,",
    "are well defined . at sufficiently low temperatures ,",
    "the system is in its ground state : ferromagnetic order for fms , and nel order for afms .",
    "the excitations consist of domain walls . in a pure ising chain ( @xmath15 ) with zero field",
    "( @xmath16 ) , the spectrum consists of discrete energy levels , where each level corresponds to states with a fixed number of domain walls .",
    "if , as is usually the case , there are additional exchange couplings in the directions transverse to the ising axis ( @xmath17 or @xmath18 ) , then the degeneracy is lifted .",
    "the energy spectrum consists of a series of continuua separated by gaps .",
    "each continuum consists of states with a fixed number of domain walls .",
    "the one - soliton approximation considers only the lowest band and neglects all transitions to higher bands .",
    "the spectrum described in the preceding paragraph has been verified numerically@xcite for the anisotropic @xmath19-@xmath20 model ; for very large anisotropy ( near the ising limit ) , isolated bands with large gaps were observed , with the gap tending to zero as the isotropic limit was approached .",
    "the one - soliton approximation was used by villain@xcite in his pioneering work on spin-1/2 solitons in ising - like afm chains .",
    "the result of his calculation  the existence of a dispersive soliton mode ( the villain mode ) below the two particle continuum  was further verified by theoretical@xcite and numerical@xcite work , inelastic neutron scattering experiments on the ising - like afms @xmath21 ( refs .  ) and @xmath22 ( refs .  ) , as well as electron spin resonance,@xcite nuclear magnetic resonance,@xcite and optical@xcite experiments .",
    "analytic work guided by physical reasoning , exact numerical work on finite systems , and experimental work on real physical systems all point to the existence of the villain mode and thus justify the one - soliton approximation .",
    "what then are the conditions necessary for the villain mode to exist ?",
    "two conditions should be met .",
    "first , a large easy - axis is required ; the system must be near the ising limit .",
    "this ensures not only that domain walls are well - defined excitations , but also that states with different numbers of domain walls are well separated in energy .",
    "second , the domain walls must have dynamics .",
    "it is the dynamics of the domain walls which induce the band structure . in a pure ising chain , for example ,",
    "a localized domain wall is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian and therefore has no dynamics",
    ". the villain mode does not exist in pure ising chains .",
    "most of the existing work has focused so far on afms , and only recently has it been pointed out that dispersive soliton modes can also exist in ising - like fms@xcite and other spin chains , as discussed next .      in view of the candidate materials to be identified in sec .",
    "[ sec - exp ] , we focus mainly on spin-1/2 fms with a hamiltonian given by  ( [ eq-h.general ] ) with @xmath23.@xcite we consider a static and homogeneous field @xmath24 along the @xmath14-axis ( the ising direction ) and rewrite the hamiltonian in a more suggestive form :    [ eq-h.primary ] @xmath25",
    "@xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28    where @xmath29 are the usual raising and lowering operators . in preparation for the one - soliton approximation , we introduce the one - soliton states @xmath30 , defined by @xmath31 the right - hand sides are expressed in the @xmath32-basis . here , @xmath33 denotes the soliton position ( @xmath34 corresponds to the center of the spin chain ) , and @xmath35 is the charge of the soliton .",
    "we can define the soliton position , charge , and translation operators@xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 respectively  as @xmath39 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are hermitian operators , whereas @xmath40 is unitary with @xmath41 .",
    "the one - soliton approximation is tantamount to considering our system as containing one domain wall and discarding those terms in  ( [ eq-h.primary ] ) which create additional solitons .",
    "for example , @xmath42 in  ( [ eq-h.perp ] ) should be discarded because these terms will always create solitons , but @xmath43 in  ( [ eq - h.a ] ) contains terms which translate the soliton by two sites , which will be identified with @xmath44 and @xmath45 . projecting  ( [ eq-h.primary ] ) onto the one - soliton subspace , we therefore obtain @xmath46 where we have dropped the hats over the operators , and are measuring energy relative to the fully polarized ( ferromagnetic ) state .",
    "the band width @xmath47 is different from zero only if @xmath48 , in contrast to afms or alternate field configurations ( see below ) . in what follows",
    ", we shall work in a fixed charge sector .",
    "thus , @xmath49 is effectively a constant and we will put @xmath50 to be definite . equation  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) is then formally equivalent to a single - band tight - binding model of an electron in an external electric field .",
    "solitons play the role of electrons , and a magnetic field the role of the electric field .",
    "we can now go on to discuss the eigenstates and energy spectrum , both of which are qualitatively very different in the finite- and zero - field regimes respectively .",
    "bloch oscillations can be derived either semiclassically from the zero - field solution , or fully quantum - mechanically from the finite - field solutions .",
    "we discuss each of these in turn .      we will first consider the known physics in zero external field in order to make contact with previous work on afms,@xcite fms,@xcite as well as with semiclassical derivations of bo .",
    "for @xmath51 , and with periodic boundary conditions , the eigenstates of  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) describing the soliton are extended bloch states labeled by the wave vector @xmath52 : @xmath53 here , we have set the lattice constant @xmath54 equal to one .",
    "the periodic dispersion relation resulting from these eigenstates is given by@xcite @xmath55 this is the ferromagnetic analog of villain s result@xcite for afms .",
    "as mentioned below , villain s result for the bandwidth @xmath47 contains the sum , rather than the difference , of the transverse couplings .",
    "semiclassically , we can reproduce the derivation of bo as it is given in conventional electronic treatments.@xcite in the absence of scattering , the effect of the field - dependent term @xmath56 in  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) is to drive the soliton through the band .",
    "the velocity @xmath57 of this motion is found by differentiating  ( [ eq - disp ] ) with respect to @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "the wave vector @xmath52 acquires a time dependence through the force @xmath58 .",
    "integrating @xmath59 over time then yields the semiclassical bloch oscillations . if @xmath60 denotes the soliton position , then @xmath61 with the bloch amplitude @xmath62 and the bloch angular frequency @xmath63 given by @xmath64      we can compare the above semiclassical derivation of bo with a fully quantum treatment by keeping a nonzero magnetic field in the hamiltonian right from the outset . for a spin-1/2 chain with @xmath65 sites , and with @xmath66 , we can exactly diagonalize  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) to yield energy eigenstates    [ eq - eigen ] @xmath67 @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the ordinary bessel function of order @xmath11 , and we have dropped the label @xmath50 in the state vectors . the state @xmath70 is _ localized _ about the lattice site @xmath71 in the sense that @xmath72 for arbitrary @xmath71 .",
    "we have thus chosen vanishing boundary conditions  a reasonable choice for localized states . the degree of localization",
    "is given by the argument of the bessel function ( see  ( [ eq-bessel.asympt ] ) below ) ; strong fields act to localize the states .",
    "for example , if @xmath73 , then @xmath74 , and only the @xmath75 term contributes to the sum in  ( [ eq - eigen ] ) since @xmath76 .",
    "the eigenstate is therefore strongly localized . as the field decreases , the wavepacket spreads .",
    "the eigenstates at finite @xmath24 are wannier - like states and are thus qualitatively different from the extended bloch states at zero field .",
    "this difference is also reflected in the energy spectrum : @xmath77 \\nonumber\\\\&= & \\sum_n     \\left [ \\delta \\left ( c_{m , n-2 } + c_{m , n+2 } \\right ) + b",
    "n c_{m , n }     \\right ] \\left| n \\right\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\&= & \\sum_n \\left [ \\delta     \\frac{2}{\\alpha } \\left(\\frac{m - n}{2}\\right ) c_{m , n } + b n c_{m , n }     \\right ] \\left| n \\right\\rangle = b m \\sum_n c_{m , n } \\left|",
    "n     \\right\\rangle = b m \\left| e_m \\right\\rangle,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and thus @xmath78 the important first term on the third line in  ( [ eigenvalue.eq ] ) was obtained using the bessel function identity@xcite @xmath79 the spectrum @xmath80 is _",
    "discrete_. it consists of a series of equally spaced levels with an energy - level spacing given by @xmath24 .",
    "the analog of this spectrum for electronic systems is known as the wannier - stark ladder .",
    "hence , for magnetic solitons , the term wannier-_zeeman _ ladder ( wzl ) seems appropriate and we shall adopt this term below .",
    "the states @xmath81 are exact eigenstates only up to boundary terms :    [ eq - corr ] @xmath82 where a typical boundary term is given by @xmath83    for large @xmath84 and finite @xmath24 ( hence finite @xmath12 ) , these boundary terms are negligible contributions .",
    "the soliton dynamics are not expected to depend on the boundary conditions for sufficiently large chains , especially since the soliton eigenstates @xmath85 are strongly localized by the field . for @xmath86 , and fixed , finite @xmath12 , the bessel function in  ( [ eq-corr.term ] ) can be replaced by its asymptotic form@xcite @xmath87 and therefore decays as @xmath88 , _ provided _ the argument @xmath12 remains fixed at some finite value .",
    "if @xmath89 , and assuming @xmath12 is indeed fixed , then the correction terms in  ( [ eq - corr ] ) can be neglected so long as the center of the eigenstate wavepacket is not near the boundaries of the chain .",
    "exact numerical diagonalization of finite chains ( see below ) indicates that the states @xmath90 can be considered eigenstates everywhere except at a small , @xmath24-dependent boundary layer on either end of the chain .",
    "the correction terms can hence be considered surface effects which become negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "more severe problems arise in the limit of vanishing field ( @xmath91 ) . in this limit , the above asymptotic form of the bessel functions can not be used since now _ both _ the order of the bessel function ( @xmath92 ) as well as its argument ( @xmath93 ) diverge .",
    "the appropriate asymptotic form for @xmath94 depends on the ratio @xmath95 ; for both @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we have@xcite @xmath98 this expression reduces to  ( [ eq-bessel.asympt ] ) in the limit @xmath99 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq - besselasym ] ) shows that @xmath94 is negligible _ only if _ @xmath100 .",
    "this effectively implies that no matter how large the system size becomes , there will always be a field sufficiently small , such that the present framework fails . in practice , this becomes problematic only when discussing the `` villain limit '' of vanishing field , where , in any case , soliton collisions must explicitly be considered ( see below ) .",
    "another approach is to compare the analytic spectrum @xmath101 with that obtained by numerically diagonalizing finite chains ( using @xmath102 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig-eig.plot](a ) , we plot the results for @xmath103 .",
    "this shows that for such fields , our analytic expressions are quite good and can be used with confidence .",
    "by contrast , fig .",
    "[ fig-eig.plot](b ) shows a comparison of numeric and analytic results for @xmath104 .",
    "we see here that the width of the boundary layer has increased greatly .",
    "( the boundary layer consists of those points which deviate substantially from the linear analytic result .",
    "in fig .  [",
    "fig-eig.plot](a ) , the boundary layer is not discernible . )",
    "the boundary layer is not a function of @xmath84 .",
    "it is a function of @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath84 increases with @xmath24 fixed , the boundary layer therefore becomes less and less important .",
    "nevertheless , as @xmath24 tends to zero , the boundary layer increases until eventually the present framework of localized eigenfunctions must be abandoned .",
    "this is our first indication of the problems associated with the @xmath105 limit .",
    "we shall return to this limit below in connection with the calculation of the dynamical structure factor . for most of this paper ,",
    "however , we shall consider either sufficiently large fields such that fig .",
    "[ fig-eig.plot](a ) is the relevant scenario , or zero fields , where a dispersive mode with bloch - like extended states is the correct description .",
    "these are the two experimentally relevant regions within the one - soliton approximation .    =    assuming a sufficiently large field ( in the sense of the previous paragraph ) and neglecting surface effects",
    ", the spectrum of  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) is the wzl , @xmath101 .",
    "the presence of the magnetic field thus destroys the continuous band structure of  ( [ eq - disp ] ) and replaces it with an evenly - spaced ladder of energy levels , with the spacing between adjacent levels given by @xmath24 . how are bo manifested within this fully quantum - mechanical framework ? to compare with the semiclassical result of  ( [ eq - sem.x ] ) and  ( [ eq-ba.bf ] ) , we should specify an initial state and compute the expectation value of @xmath36 as a function of time .",
    "let us keep the initial state arbitrary and write @xmath106 .",
    "then , @xmath107 where re denotes the real part . if we assume , for example , that all @xmath108 are real , and also that @xmath109 , then the oscillating piece of  ( [ eq-qm.mag ] ) is identical to the oscillating piece of  ( [ eq - sem.x ] ) .",
    "however , if we take as the initial state one which is completely localized at one lattice site , @xmath110 , then the oscillating piece identically vanishes .",
    "this situation corresponds to the state vector evolving symmetrically about both sides of the initial position @xmath71 in a sort of breather state .",
    "thus , the behavior depends sensitively upon the initial conditions .",
    "semiclassically , we have seen that bo result from the soliton being pushed unscattered through the band and undergoing bragg reflection at the zone boundary . by contrast , in a full quantum treatment , bo result from the time evolution of a state which is not a ( wannier - zeeman ) eigenstate of the hamiltonian .",
    "the frequency of oscillation is given by twice the energy between adjacent states .",
    "this is a result of the fact that  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) , with @xmath51 , contains an intrinsic periodicity of _ two _ lattice constants , which also accounts for the fact that the brillouin zone is halved , as shown by  ( [ eq - disp ] ) .",
    "this effect can be understood semiclassically in terms of the berry phase of the spins and is a result of the spin parity ( see ref .   for more details ) .",
    "finally , we note that bo are a many - body effect which should be distinguished from larmor precession of uncoupled spins in an external field .",
    "the former yields an oscillating magnetic moment along the direction of the applied field whereas the latter yields oscillations in directions transverse to the field .",
    "we have focused on biaxial fms because the materials we have identified as candidates for observing bo are all biaxial fms . in the next subsection , we show that bo of magnetic solitons can also exist in uniaxial fms ( @xmath111 ) if the field is tilted away from the ising - axis .",
    "we also show that bo exist in anisotropic afms if an inhomogeneous field is applied .",
    "it is not necessary to have a biaxial fm in order to create bo .",
    "in fact , a uniaxial fm ( @xmath111 ) may be preferable because the band width can then be externally controlled .",
    "for example , consider  ( [ eq-h.general ] ) with ferromagnetic couplings , with @xmath111 , and with a homogeneous magnetic field along both the @xmath19- and @xmath14-axes ( @xmath14 is still the ising axis ) . the hamiltonian is almost the same as  ( [ eq-h.primary ] ) ; the differences are that @xmath43 now vanishes ( because @xmath111 ) and there is a new term coming from the field in the @xmath19 direction : @xmath112 this term gives hopping by one site .",
    "the one - soliton hamiltonian is @xmath113 which is practically identical to  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) .",
    "thus , uniaxial fms exhibit the wzl if the external field is tilted away from the ising axis .",
    "the important difference between this and the biaxial case is that now the strength of _ both _ terms are adjustable externally .",
    "the energy eigenvalues here are as in  ( [ eq-ws.ladder ] ) , but the eigenstates are replaced by @xmath114 although some of the materials we will identify in the following sections are reported to have only uniaxial anisotropy , the material which seems to the best characterized , and for which we provide the most detailed analysis , is one which is reported to be a fm with biaxial anisotropy .",
    "it is more difficult to achieve bo in afms because of the local nel order .",
    "we mentioned above that bo can be viewed , at least semiclassically , as the result of applying a force on a particle in a band .",
    "how can one apply a force to an antiferromagnetic domain wall ?",
    "the force is given by @xmath115 . if the external field @xmath116 is homogeneous , then the force quickly averages to zero over the chain .",
    "however , applying an _ inhomogeneous _ field produces a net force .",
    "equation  ( [ eq-h.primary ] ) can still be used , but the couplings are now negative , and @xmath117 must be slightly altered to reflect the inhomogeneity of the field : @xmath118 the one - soliton states must also be redefined . rather than  ( [ eq - mn ] ) , we should write @xmath119 the charge @xmath49 can be defined by the first spin at the end of the chain:@xcite @xmath120 for spin - up , and @xmath121 for spin - down .",
    "now it is @xmath43 in  ( [ eq - h.a ] ) which will always create additional solitons ( and thus should be discarded in the one - soliton approximation ) .",
    "conversely , @xmath42 translates solitons . as a specific example",
    ", we can take a magnetic field along the easy axis that linearly increases along the chain axis : @xmath122 ( such a field satisfies maxwell s equation @xmath123 ) .",
    "projecting down to the one - soliton sector , we obtain @xmath124 this hamiltonian is again similar to  ( [ eq - h1sol ] ) .",
    "the spectrum again consists of the wzl , but due to the antiferromagnetism , the dependence of the spectrum on the position variable @xmath71 is slightly altered : @xmath125 the eigenstates are also very similar to  ( [ eq - eigen ] ) .",
    "only @xmath12 must be slightly changed , again to reflect the antiferromagnetism : @xmath126 thus , much of what follows applies also to afms where the anisotropy can be either uniaxial or biaxial .",
    "one must only replace the homogeneous field with a linearly increasing field .    in most of what follows",
    ", we shall consider biaxial fms with static and homogeneous fields .",
    "the present subsection , however , shows that the same analysis can be carried over , almost without change , to uniaxial fms and to biaxial and uniaxial afms .      here",
    ", we briefly touch on the conditions necessary to observe bo in physical systems .",
    "this discussion will have to remain rather vague , as it requires a detailed knowledge of specific material properties and , based on that , further theoretical investigations .",
    "still , we can list a few essential conditions in general terms , which are very similar to the ones studied in the context of mesoscopic effects in electronic systems.@xcite    first , there should be no zener transitions ( interband tunneling ) .",
    "the soliton oscillates only when it is reflected from one zone boundary to the opposite one within the same band .",
    "if the force on the soliton is too strong , it will gain so much energy at the top of the band that it will tunnel into a higher energy band .",
    "this tunneling will produce classical linear motion , rather than the quantum mechanical bo .",
    "such transitions can be neglected if the bloch frequency is much larger than the zener transition rate .",
    "this effectively puts an upper bound on the field driving the particle . in the present context , it means that the exchange constant @xmath127 along the easy axis , a measure of the band gap , should be much larger than the magnetic field @xmath24 .",
    "second , there should be no inelastic scattering .",
    "such events occur , for example , by emission and absorption of phonons , or via soliton - soliton interaction .",
    "inelastic scattering may destroy the phase coherent motion of the particles necessary for bo to occur .",
    "a detailed investigation into the nature and especially the magnitude of the spin - lattice coupling in the spin - chains we shall be discussing below is beyond the scope of the present work , and is , in any case , probably a matter best determined experimentally ( e.g. from the measured line - width in the structure factor ) .",
    "it is known , however , that the spin - lattice couplings are far weaker than the analogous charge - lattice couplings .",
    "also , if the soliton density is low enough , soliton - soliton interactions , being typically of short - range nature , can be neglected and the results of band theory are still valid . in ising - like spin chains , a low - density requirement implies that the temperature should be less than the exchange coupling @xmath128 .",
    "again this can be typically satisfied .",
    "finally , elastic scattering , such as scattering from static random impurities , may also be a problem ( although typically less restrictive ) .",
    "here , one should consider the anderson localization length induced by random disorder in low - dimensional systems .",
    "this length , which is on the order of the elastic mean free path of the propagating quasiparticle@xcite ( in the present case , the soliton ) , should be greater than the bloch amplitude , which places a lower bound on the @xmath4 field driving the soliton .",
    "however , since the bloch amplitude can typically be on the order of the lattice constant , this poses no severe constraints .",
    "although the above conditions are demanding , it is quite encouraging that the presence of extended states of dispersive solitons ( i.e. the villain mode ) has been established experimentally in ising - like antiferromagnets.@xcite this suggests that , at least for certain spin - chains , inelastic scattering and disorder can be neglected to first approximation . in the end , the inelastic mean free time @xmath129 should be compared with the bloch frequency @xmath63 .",

    "for the parameters given in table  [ tab - tink ] , this puts a restriction on the field strength of @xmath333 .",
    "for example , if we apply a 0.81 tesla field  comfortably below this upper bound",
    " then the bloch amplitude and frequency are given from  ( [ eq-ba.bf ] ) as @xmath334 this amplitude is small enough to impede the destructive influence of any scattering events , and the frequency falls within the capabilities of neutron scattering .",
    "this is therefore an encouraging result .    due to the antiferromagnetic interchain couplings @xmath335 and @xmath336 , the material undergoes a three - dimensional ordering transition at about 17k .",
    "below this temperature , and in zero external field , there still exists ferromagnetic order within each chain , but the chains are ordered antiferromagnetically with respect to each other . as the field is turned on",
    "there are successive transitions from antiferromagnetic , to ferrimagnetic , and finally to ferromagnetic order at fields @xmath337 and @xmath338 respectively . at all times",
    ", the intrachain order is ferromagnetic .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig - phases ] , where we also list the interchain coupling values@xcite and the critical fields.@xcite    = 8.5 cm    when determining the bloch amplitude and frequency , one should also include these internal fields .",
    "for example , a bloch amplitude of one lattice constant , which results from a _ total _ field of @xmath339 t , can be realized in all three phases when these internal fields are taken into account .",
    "explicitly , we have ( for @xmath340 t )    @xmath341    @xmath342    @xmath343    the notation @xmath344 , for example , denotes the total field at a chain with spin down , where `` down '' is defined as being opposite to the external field .",
    "thus , in the ferromagnetic phase , all chains are spin up . in fig .",
    "[ fig - bloch ] we plot the resulting predictions for the bloch frequency and ( inverse ) bloch amplitude as a function of external field in all three phases .",
    "= 8.5 cm    the antiferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic phases show two curves because these phases have both spin up and spin down chains , and these chains each feel a different field .",
    "the dotted horizontal lines are bounds , outside of which the results become equivocal ; near the upper bound , the total field becomes comparable to the ising exchange constant @xmath127 ; near the lower bound , the amplitude becomes too large , so that scattering effects should probably be taken into account .",
    "there is however , a fairly large intermediate range of over 400ghz where the effect should be noticeable .",
    "we hope the present work can motivate some experimental investigation into this material which seems to have disappeared from the attention of contemporary research .",
    "another material we wish to mention here is @xmath345 ( ref .  ) .",
    "this material differs from the one above only by the spacer material ",
    "pyridine molecules rather than water .",
    "pyridine is a larger molecule than water and so the magnetic chains are further apart by about a factor of 1.7 ( 9.4versus 5.5  for the water spacer ) .",
    "this material is thus a better one - dimensional material than @xmath330 .",
    "the three dimensional ordering temperature is about 5.4 times smaller than it is in @xmath346 ( 3.17k rather than 17k ) .",
    "the material parameters are summarized in table  [ tab - tink ] .",
    "because the experimental work on this material seems less extensive than that on @xmath5 , we have not made any predictions for bo in this material .",
    "but due to the reduced three - dimensional ordering temperature , this material should be a better candidate for observing bo and the wzl .",
    "even if there really is no transverse anisotropy ( @xmath347 ) , bo could still be induced by simply applying a transverse field in addition to the one along the ising - axis ( see sec .  [ sec - fm ] ) .",
    "most of the preceding paragraph applies even more emphatically to the final two materials listed in table  [ tab - tink ] , particularly to fetac.@xcite the small magnitude of the interchain couplings and the lower three - dimensional ordering temperature indicate that these materials may be quite suitable for bo .",
    "we have again chosen not to provide predictions for this compound since we believe further material characterization is necessary .    in summary ,",
    "we have shown in this section that there are a number of materials which may exhibit a dispersive soliton mode as well as bo .",
    "we have not discussed any afm chains because we have been unable to identify any with the appropriate material parameters such that the bloch frequency and amplitude fall within experimentally accessible regimes . should any such chains exist , sec .  [ sec - afm ] shows that bo may exist under an applied inhomogeneous magnetic field .",
    "in this work , we have shown that bo of magnetic solitons occur in anisotropic spin-1/2 chains .",
    "although we have focused primarily on biaxial ising - like fms , we have shown that bo can also occur in uniaxial fms by applying a transverse field in addition to the longitudinal field .",
    "we have also shown that bo may exist in ising - like afms by applying an inhomogeneous field .",
    "we have been mainly envisioning a neutron scattering experiment in this work because the dynamical structure factor shows clear evidence of the wzl ; it contains sharp peaks at integer multiples of the bloch frequency . at zero wave vector ,",
    "all the peaks vanish except for the one at zero frequency and those at the bloch frequency @xmath348 .",
    "thus , a measurement of the magnetization autocorrelation function ( magnetic susceptibility ) about the bloch frequency should also detect the wzl .",
    "several materials are promising candidates for observing bo and the wzl .",
    "we have chosen to focus our estimates on the one - dimensional salt @xmath330 .",
    "although this material is not an ideal one - dimensional substance ( better ones have been identified above ) , bo of amplitude one lattice constant ( about 3.6 ) and frequency of about 154ghz are possible with applied fields of a few tesla .",
    "the other materials we have mentioned are less well characterized than the one just described .",
    "however , the much smaller interchain coupling indicates that they are better one - dimensional samples  a statement further supported by their three - dimensional ordering temperature , which is much lower than @xmath7 .",
    "it is possible that these materials contain only uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "if so , bo can be achieved by tilting the external field away from the ising axis .",
    "a question we are currently investigating is what effect soliton - soliton interactions have on the wzl , as well as the related question on the influence of the higher - soliton states .",
    "the wzl and bo should survive if the number of solitons is conserved . in ref .",
    ", a study is presented of soliton dynamics in the two - soliton sector ( but in zero applied field ) .",
    "if one enforces periodic boundary conditions , then only even numbers of solitons can exist .",
    "but quantities calculated in the thermodynamic limit should be independent of the boundary conditions employed .",
    "therefore , as expected , this work found practically the same result for the dynamical structure factor as villain did working in the one - soliton sector .",
    "however , the two - soliton sector brings with it an opportunity to directly detect the _ coherent oscillation of solitons_. for example , two solitons can form a bound state which should be identified as a magnon in spin-1/2 chains .",
    "multiple magnon bound states can then be formed in which a cluster of adjacent spins are all flipped relative to the majority of the ferromagnetically aligned spins in the chain .",
    "indeed , these are precisely the excitations measured in the work of ref .   which concerns the optical excitation of multiple - magnon bound states .",
    "an enticing scenario exists if the ends of these clusters also undergo bloch oscillation . rather than having these excitations thermally created , as we have been assuming above , one can then optically create these excitations _ coherently _ by infrared radiation .",
    "the resulting bloch oscillations will then also be coherent , and this may be detected , for example , by looking for coherent emission of magnetic dipole radiation in the microwave regime . in this scenario ,",
    "the magnetic bloch oscillator is an emitter of coherent microwave radiation .",
    "this is essentially the analog of the electronic bo experiments , were the charge carriers are optically excited with visible light , and the electron dipole oscillations radiate in the submillimeter regime .",
    "there are no exciton effects in our spin chains and so the detection of the magnetic radiation would be a clear signal of magnetic bloch oscillations",
    ". this intriguing problem will be the subject of a future publication .",
