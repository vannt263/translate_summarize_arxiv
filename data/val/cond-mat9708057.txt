    "investigations of the decay rate of metastable states have a long history , going back to kramers@xcite who calculated the lifetime of a classical trapped particle separated from the true equilibrium state by a high potential barrier .",

    "let @xmath7 denote the coordinates of the system under consideration depending in general on imaginary time @xmath8 and spatial variables @xmath9 within the semiclassical approximation the decay rate at a temperature @xmath10 is determined by the contribution of the trajectories close to the one extremizing the euclidean action and satisfying the periodicity condition @xmath11 in the high - temperature regime the function extremizing the action is time independent and , consequently , the activation barrier in the arrhenius law @xmath12 does not depend on the dynamic properties of the system , meanwhile the bounce solution at low temperatures is time - dependent and the dynamics enters .",
    "at some temperature @xmath0 the transition from the time - independent to the time - dependent solution occurs . in some cases",
    "the bounce solution just below the crossover point can be written in the form    @xmath13    where the function @xmath14 is considered to be small .",
    "such an assumption leads to an action @xmath15 with a continuous first derivative in the crossover point ( see fig .  1 ) .",

    "we deal with a first - order transition : it can be shown that the first derivative of @xmath15 has a jump at the transition point ( see fig .  2 ) and",
    "the expansion @xmath18 is not valid .    strictly speaking ,",
    "even if we deal with a first - order transition in a tunneling problem , there is a narrow crossover region from one solution to another because contributions originate from several saddle points and we need to take into account all of them .",

    "the above physics can be easily realized .",
    "consider a given function @xmath54 for a trapped particle . then there",
    "exist infinitely many potentials reproducing @xmath54 as their oscillation times @xcite . a simple way to obtain a non - monotonous behavior is to choose a function @xmath54 with one minimum . for more complicated nonmonotonous dependences the system can exhibit several transitions . in general",

    "however , for dissipative systems one can not use the energy as it is no more a conserved quantity . in this case",
    "we can parametrize the periodic imaginary time solutions of the equation of motion by the amplitude @xmath82 of the oscillations : the amplitude @xmath82 quantifies the difference between the thermal and the weakly time - dependent solutions in the vicinity of the thermal saddle - point solution ( later we will show how to define such a notion as the `` amplitude '' for any metastable system ) .",
    "it can be easily understood that if @xmath83 is not a monotonous function of the amplitude , the system exhibits a first - order transition : starting from the zero temperature bounce solution the period @xmath84 decreases with increasing temperature .",

    "it turns out that a general expression for @xmath83 can be obtained for a wide class of systems .    at high temperatures the saddle - point solution is time - independent .",
    "let us slightly perturb this solution and calculate its oscillation time in the vicinity of the point @xmath87 we suppose that the imaginary time lagrangian @xmath89 of the system under consideration can be written in the form @xmath90 where the term @xmath91 is responsible for the dynamical properties of the system and @xmath92 is the potential energy .",
