    "in the ` standard ' scenario the spectrum of gamma  ray bursts ( grbs ) is interpreted as synchrotron / inverse compton radiation from relativistic electrons accelerated in internal shocks within a relativistic outflow ( rees & mszros 1994 ) .",
    "the majority of the observed spectral and temporal grb properties are fairly well interpreted within this framework .",
    "however , the nature of the prompt emission remains one of the most interesting unresolved problems related to grb events .",
    "in particular , the spectral parameter ( e.g. in the band s parametric representation , band et al . 1993 ) which is most constraining for the emission models of grbs is the low energy power law photon index @xmath2 .",
    "synchrotron radiation from isotropic particle distributions ( katz 1994 ) , as well as alternative scenarios ( see e.g. lloyd & petrosian 2002 ; mszros & rees 2000 ; granot , piran & sari 2000 ; ghisellini , celotti & lazzati 2000 ) predict limits on @xmath2 which are consistent with at most 70 per cent of the analyzed grb spectra ( e.g. preece et al . 2000 ) .",
    "radiation mechanisms other than synchrotron have been proposed : they involve comptonization of a thermal photon / particle distributions , e.g. compton drag model ( lazzati et al .",
    "2000 ) or quasi - thermal comptonization model ( ghisellini & celotti 1999 ; rees & mszros 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , the time ",
    "resolved spectral analysis revealed that the spectrum evolves with time ( e.g. ford et al .",
    "1995 ; preece et al",
    "this might indicate an evolution of the physical conditions of the plasma , or that various emission processes dominate at different times and/or that the spectral evolution is directly related to the central engine physics .",
    "ghirlanda , celotti , ghisellini ( 2003 ) [ gcg03 hereafter ] , focusing on the time resolved spectral analysis of a handful of extremely hard grb spectra , enlightened the difficulties of non - thermal models in accounting for them and suggested that in some bursts the initial emission phase could have a thermal character .",
    "more recently , ryde ( 2004 ) [ r04 hereafter ] studied a few grbs with very hard spectra , discussing the observed emission in terms of two spectral components , i.e. a black body and a power - law , which showed relative variable strengths throughout the burst durations .",
    "in fact , in the standard grb model ( e.g. mszros & rees 2000 ; daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ) a thermal spectrum is predicted to appear when the fireball becomes transparent ( see the above references for alternative scenarios ) .",
    "initial thermal emission does not exclude the presence of a non  thermal contribution due to the development of internal shocks within the fireball .",
    "therefore , we should expect to find grbs where both thermal and non - thermal components are present and might evolve differently due to their different origins ( e.g. rees & mszros 2004 ) .",
    "in this paper we report the finding ( by chance ) of a new hard burst , grb 990413 , which is particularly interesting for its spectral and temporal properties .",
    "the emission of grb  990413 is consistent with thermal black body spectrum also after the initial phase and differently from the other cases of `` thermal bursts '' , its light curve shows a high level of variability .",
    "the finest time resolved spectral analysis reveals the presence of an underlying non - thermal emission component and shows that the spectral evolution of the thermal and non  thermal components is correlated with the light curve variability .",
    "we present the overall characteristics and the time integrated properties of grb 990413 in sections 2 and 3 .",
    "the analysis and results on its spectral evolution and its correlation with the observed light curve variability are the content of sections 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "grb 990413 was detected by batsectlg / index.html ] .",
    "it has a total fluence of @xmath3 erg @xmath4 in the energy range @xmath5 kev .",
    "its duration is t@xmath6 s and its peak flux ( integrated in the range 50 - 300 kev ) is @xmath7 phot @xmath4 s@xmath8 , reached @xmath9 s after the trigger .",
    "these duration and peak flux are consistent with those typical of the long batse grb population ( e.g. paciesas 1999 ) . the 64 ms resolution time profile integrated over the four batse energy channels ( i.e. for energies @xmath5 kev ) consists of two separate broad pulses ( fig .  1 , top ) with superimposed substructures of width @xmath10 per cent of the main pulse width .",
    "the broad pulses ( visually examined ) span over the time intervals 0 - 8 s and 10 - 14 s after the trigger .",
    "the spectral analysis was performed on the high energy resolution burst ( herb ) data , which are typically composed by 120 energy channel spectra distributed in the range @xmath11 kev , and have a rate ",
    "dependent accumulation time .",
    "the spectra were selected from the most illuminated large area detector ( lad # 5 ) in order to have the highest signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) ( e.g. band et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the background spectrum was estimated as the average spectrum over two time intervals before and after the burst trigger ( 2070 s and 19 s , respectively ) .    the count spectrum , accumulated over the grb total duration of 14 s after the burst trigger ,",
    "was fitted with the band model , i.e. parametrized by a smoothly connected double power - law with low and high energy spectral indices @xmath2 and @xmath12 , and a break energy @xmath13 ( band et al . 1993 , preece et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this model fit resulted in @xmath14 for 95 d.o.f .",
    ", with an extremely hard low energy spectral slope , i.e. @xmath15 and an unconstrained @xmath12 due to the low signal above @xmath16 kev .",
    "we adopted therefore the comp model , i.e. a power law with a high energy exponential cutoff @xmath17 , to fit the spectrum ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "with this model the reduced @xmath18 for 96 d.o.f .",
    "was formally obtained ; the comp model best fit also indicated a very hard low energy spectral component , with photon spectral index @xmath19 , and an e - folding energy @xmath20 kev , which corresponds to a peak energy @xmath21 kev in the @xmath22 spectrum .",
    "as a possible test of the consistency with the synchrotron model , we also fitted the spectrum with a comp model with frozen low energy spectral photon index @xmath23 , i.e. the limiting value of the optically thin synchrotron emission ( tavani 1996 ) .",
    "the fit resulted in a reduced @xmath24 for 97 d.o.f .",
    ", rejecting the model at 99.9 per cent confidence level .    given the extreme hardness of the low energy spectral component , we fitted the time integrated spectrum of grb  990413 with a black body model ( bb ) . the best fit ( @xmath25=1.27 for 97 d.o.f . )",
    "corresponds to a temperature @xmath26 kev , i.e. a peak energy @xmath27196 kev .",
    "this value is consistent with the few hundred kev peak energies found in the other 10 grbs found ( so far ) to be consistent with thermal spectra ( gcg03 and r04 ) .",
    "we also note that , although the grb spectrum is well fitted by a bb model , its low energy slope is slightly steeper than the rayleigh  jeans extrapolation in the low energy domain ( i.e. @xmath28 ) , as already indicated by the best comp fit which gives @xmath29 .",
    "following the procedure described in gcg03 we also tested the robustness of the spectral fits . to this aim : 1 ) we performed the fits reducing the energy range at the high energy end to assess whether the characteristic exponential cutoff energy of the comp model might determine a hard low energy spectral component and we found that @xmath2 did not significantly change within the confidence interval centered around the above best fit value ; 2 ) we examined the ( null ) influence of different background spectra by choosing different time intervals to compute the average background ; 3 ) we used the data from the second ranked lad ( # 7 ) .",
    "the spectral fit resulted in a still positive , but less steep @xmath2=0.29@xmath30 . because of the lower s / n ratio , in this case @xmath31=1.61 for 97 d.o.f . ;",
    "4 ) as a check of the possible dependence on the detector response , we used the detector response matrix ( drm ) corresponding to another grb to fit the spectrum of grb 990413 .",
    "to this purpose we searched for a grb with approximately the same angle of incidence and sky position and adopted its drm to fit the spectrum of grb 990413 .",
    "the fit with the comp model gives @xmath32 , with @xmath33=1.26 for 97 d.o.f .",
    "we conclude that the result that grb 990413 has an extremely hard low energy spectrum , consistent with a bb model , is indeed robust .",
    "as well known the grb spectrum typically evolves in time with no unique behavior .",
    "the spectral evolution is evident in all of the three spectral parameters , i.e. low and high energy spectral slopes and peak energy .",
    "for instance , the asymptotic @xmath2 evolves in 58 per cent of the bursts ( crider et al 1997 ) .",
    "also the grbs with a thermal spectrum show evidence of a spectral evolution which is well described by the best fit temperature .",
    "gcg03 found that in their 5 grbs the bb temperature , after an initial constant phase ( of few tenths of a second ) , evolves as @xmath34 .",
    "a slightly steeper decay , @xmath35 , was found in other 5 ` thermal ' bursts by r04 .",
    "the luminosity evolution instead does not show a unique behavior .",
    "we performed a time resolved spectral analysis using herb data ( see table  1 ) , covering the time interval @xmath36 s after the trigger time , for a total of 5 spectra with similar integration time ( @xmath37 1.2 s each , except the last one ) .",
    "we fitted them with both the comp and the bb model .",
    "the results are shown in table  1 .",
    "the reduced @xmath38 is acceptable in almost all cases ( a possibly larger value is found only for the last spectrum which is indeed characterized by a lower s / n ) .",
    "the typical values @xmath2 for the comp model are similar to that found from the analysis of the time integrated spectrum ( i.e. @xmath39 - sec .  2 ) .",
    "only the second spectrum shows a slightly softer low energy spectral component ( see sec .  3 for a possible explanation ) .",
    "the peak spectral energy @xmath40 decreases from an initial value of @xmath41 kev to @xmath42 kev in the late time spectrum , indicating a typical hard - to - soft evolution .    in fig .  1 ( middle and bottom panels ) we report the evolution of the spectral parameters of the bb fit ( see @xmath43 in tab",
    "the bb flux ( integrated in the fit energy range ) is nearly constant for the initial 2.36 s and then decreases approximately as @xmath44 .",
    "the temperature evolution is instead well described by @xmath45 ( solid line in the bottom panel of fig .  1 ) .",
    "this behavior fully agrees with what found by gcg03 for their set of ` thermal ' grbs .",

    "we integrated the spectra in time bins tracking the ` peaks ' and dips of the light curve ; the selected time intervals are shown in fig .  3 , top panel , and reported in the first column of table  2 .    for all the spectra , in 15 selected time intervals , we first tested the bb model , and found that it does still give acceptable fits , except for those corresponding to the 4 ` dips ' identified in the light curve . in these latter cases we found that the spectrum is best fitted by a single power - law ( pl ) model .",
    "this appears to suggest the presence of a second non  thermal spectral component .",
    "indeed the known grbs with evidence of thermal spectra exhibit a smooth , continuous evolution in time , from an initial thermal phase to a non - thermal one ( gcg03 ) and a double model fit , i.e. bb+pl , has been used by r04 .",
    "we thus systematically analyzed all the 15 spectra with both the bb and the pl model ( separately and jointly ) and report the results in tab .  2 and graphically in fig .",

    "in the previous section it has been shown that the spectral components ( thermal and non  thermal ) present in grb  990413 appear to be correlated to the variability of its light curve . in this respect grb  990413",
    "presents a new , unique phenomenology .",
    "the light curves of the other 10 ` thermal ' bursts are qualitatively smoother than that of grb  990413 which is instead similar to the majority of grbs . in this section",
    "we quantitatively assess these statements by comparing the variability of grb  990413 with that of typical non  thermal bursts and with the small sample of the thermal grbs .    in order to evaluate the observed variability we applied the method proposed by fenimore @xmath88 ramirez - ruiz ( 2000 ) .",
    "we computed the variability as @xmath89 where c@xmath90 are the source photon counts ( at 64 ms resolution ) ; @xmath91 is the number of time bins with a signal @xmath92 above the background ; c@xmath93 is the number of peak counts used for normalization ; @xmath94c@xmath95 are the counts smoothed with the boxcar window of width @xmath96 .",
    "the choice of the time interval for smoothing was determined by the average ( observed ) thermal phase duration , i.e. @xmath96 is comparable or shorter than the time interval in which the thermal spectra were observed ( clearly longer time scales would not reflect the fast fluctuations that we want to sample ) .",
    "we performed several tests and the optimal choice was found to be @xmath96 = 3 s. as the observed time history should be corrected for the cosmological time dilation , we also verified how the result would change if a burst was placed at a typical redshift @xmath97=1 : we found - applying the correction as defined in fenimore @xmath88 ramirez - ruiz ( 2000 ) - that the variability changes by less than 10 per cent ( the major effect is produced by variations in the smoothing time window ) .    as the uncertainties on the measured variability @xmath98 ( see reichart et al .",
    "2001 for the detailed procedure to estimate them ) strongly depend on the brightness of the event , for the comparison between grb  990413 and a larger set of bursts we computed @xmath98 for a sample of 217 batse grbs of comparable durations ( t@xmath9910 s ) and peak fluxes ( 3.7 phot s@xmath8 @xmath100 p@xmath101 30.7 phot s@xmath8 @xmath4 ) .",
    "this latter range includes the fluxes measured for grb  990413 and the bursts analyzed in gcg03 .",
    "the results are shown in figure 5 : the variablity of grb  990413 is clearly similar to the majority of the grbs in the sample , while it exceeds ( by a factor @xmath37 10 in @xmath98 ) the rest of the ` thermal ' bursts .",
    "we verified that this does not depend on the choice of @xmath96 , and found that the variability of grb  990413 increases proportionally to the length of the smoothing timescale with respect to the other hard - thermal bursts .",
    "the 5 grbs analyzed by r04 have lower peak fluxes and for the given smoothing time scale ( @xmath96=3 s ) their variability ranges from @xmath102 to @xmath103 ( although with large uncertainties due to the low s / n ) , i.e. lower than that of grb  990413 .",
    "we presented the time integrated and the time resolved spectral analysis of the long duration ( 14 s ) double peaked batse burst grb  990413 that was found to have an extremely hard spectrum .",
    "our analysis indicates that ( i ) the average spectrum is consistent with thermal emission with typical temperature @xmath104 kev , comparable to the other 10 thermal bursts , and ( ii ) the spectral evolution of this component is consistent with what found for the thermal grbs , i.e @xmath105 .    however , we find evidence that a second non  thermal component contributes to the spectrum during the main pulse , in correspondence with the highly variable phase . a combined model ( thermal + non  thermal ) has been fitted to the time resolved spectra , showing that : ( i ) the non  thermal component is present only for about 1 s during the long ( 14 s ) burst , ( ii ) its slope does not evolve in time and indicates a hard spectrum and ( iii ) it dominates the flux only in correspondence of the minima ( ` dips ' ) of the grb light curve , while the thermal component dominates for all of the rest of the burst duration .    in the standard grb",
    "fireball model thermal emission is expected from the expanding fireball when it becomes transparent and typically before the non - thermal particle acceleration in internal shocks occurs .",
    "this scenario for the two emission phases can account for an initial thermal spectrum evolving into a non  thermal one , as observed in the 10 grbs studied by gcg03 and r04 .",
    "grb  990413 , besides the hard - thermal component , revealed a non  thermal contribution still during the ( possibly ) photospheric phase .",
    "moreover , this component is associated with the rapid temporal variability ( @xmath98=0.016 ) that is a result , in the internal shock scenario , of the velocity distribution of the colliding shells within the relativistic outflow .",
    "therefore , any model aimed at accounting for the spectral properties of grb  990413 needs to allow for the possibility of developing internal shocks ( or other forms of dissipation ) inside the photosphere ( e.g. daigne & mochkovitch 2002 ; rees & meszaros 2004 ) , and has to reproduce consistently the evolution of their relative contributions .",
    "the presence of rapid dips during a thermal dominated phase is also interesting . among the possible",
    "causes two appear quite plausible : ( i ) there might be inhomogeneities in the fireball optical depth ( at the time of transparency ) ; ( ii ) the dips directly trace the central engine intermittence in energy injection and launching of the fireball ( the dips duration still largely exceed the typical timescales associated with the fireball formation ) .",
    "while it is not easy to estimate the percentage of grbs which may show a detectable thermal component , the fact that grb  990413 was found independently of its spectral properties may indicate that this phenomenology is more common than known so far .",
    "it should be noticed that the at the brightness level of grb 990413 , the consistency of the spectrum with such a black - body like component is not due to low signal - to - noise ratio .    a detailed numerical calculation of the ` transition ' to transparency and the formation of internal shocks might clarify the relative roles of the two different radiative regimes and provide information on the fireball physical parameters ( lorentz factor distribution of the shells , baryon loading ) .",
