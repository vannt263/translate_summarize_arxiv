    "at temperatures below the muon mass and above @xmath5 mev , the universe is filled by a plasma of photons , electrons , positrons , and neutrinos , kept in thermodynamical equilibrium by the electroweak interactions .",
    "as the temperature drops below this value , the rate of weak interactions starts to be comparable with the universe expansion rate , and neutrinos decouple from the electromagnetic @xmath6 plasma . for most practical purposes ,",
    "it is accurate enough to consider the freeze - out of neutrinos as fully achieved at temperatures of about @xmath7 mev . in this limit neutrinos",
    "do not share any entropy release from @xmath1 annihilations , once the temperature drops further , below the electron mass .",
    "assuming that all the entropy produced by the annihilations is transferred to photons , their temperature @xmath8 is increased with respect to the neutrino temperature by the well known factor @xmath9 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "actually more accurate calculations show that neutrinos are still slightly interacting with the electromagnetic plasma and thus receive a small portion of the entropy from @xmath1 annihilations  @xcite .",
    "neutrinos with higher momenta are more heated , since , in the relevant range of energies , weak interactions get stronger with rising energy .",
    "this produces a momentum dependent distortion in the neutrino spectra from the equilibrium fermi  dirac behaviour .    a further , though smaller , effect on @xmath10",
    "is induced by finite temperature qed corrections to the electromagnetic plasma .",
    "in fact electromagnetic interactions modify the @xmath1 and @xmath11 dispersion relations , and thus the energy density and pressure of the plasma .",
    "more precisely , the energy density is lowered so that the @xmath1 annihilation phase releases less entropy with respect to the non - interacting particle limit calculation .",
    "since most of this energy ends up into photons , this decrease results in a smaller @xmath10 ratio @xcite .",
    "while any direct observation of the actual distortions in the neutrino distributions is out of question , nevertheless we can hope that the increase of the total energy of the relic neutrinos may have a sizeable effect on the expansion rate of the universe . the energy density stored in relativistic species , @xmath12 ,",
    "is customarily given in terms of the so - called _ effective number of neutrino species _",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 , through the relation @xmath13 \\ , \\rho_\\gamma \\,\\ , , \\label{neff}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the energy density of photons , whose value today is known from the measurement of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature .",
    "( [ neff ] ) can be also written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the energy density of a single specie of massless neutrino with an equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution , and @xmath17 is the photon energy density in the instantaneous neutrino decoupling approximation .",
    "the normalization of @xmath0 is such that it gives @xmath18 in the standard case of three families of massless neutrinos , in the limit of an instantaneous decoupling . in principle",
    ", @xmath19 can receive contribution from other relativistic relics with energy density @xmath20 as well . in the following",
    "we will mostly restrict our analysis to the standard case , but we will further consider this more general framework in section 4 .    as we will discuss below , when considered separately , the non instantaneous neutrino decoupling gives @xmath21",
    "@xcite , while qed effects contribute for about @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "could the two effects be added linearly , they therefore would produce a final value @xmath23 .",
    "recently , these effects have been reconsidered in  @xcite .",
    "this work combines the results for the non instantaneous neutrino decoupling obtained by a numerical calculation in @xcite and then replacing the ratio @xmath24 with the value obtained by considering qed corrections .",
    "this procedure may provide a good estimate , but it is worth pointing out that , since qed effects modify several points of the boltzmann equations describing neutrino decoupling , it is advisable to study any possible interplay of the two effects",
    ". actually a precision calculation of this kind , where both these effects are included at the same time , is still lacking , and it is the aim of the present paper .",
    "we will show that this interplay ends up in a @xmath25 smaller total correction to @xmath19 than what would be obtained by simply adding the two contributions .",
    "we also notice that the calculation of  @xcite seems to underestimate .",
    "this can be easily understood by noticing that in  @xcite it is found a final ratio @xmath10 closer to @xmath26 than what obtained in  @xcite . ]",
    "the corrections from non instantaneous neutrino decoupling with respect to the result found in @xcite .",
    "our analysis is based on a numerical code described in @xcite , which has been modified to take into account qed finite temperature effects .    from the observational point of view",
    "the effects considered in this paper are too small to influence big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , since they produce a change in the @xmath27he mass fraction , @xmath28  @xcite , which is smaller than the actual theoretical , @xmath29 @xcite , and experimental , @xmath30 @xcite , uncertainties on this quantity .",
    "this change is actually slightly larger when one takes into account the effect of flavour neutrino oscillations , as recently shown in @xcite .",
    "more promisingly , they might be detected via future precision cmb anisotropy measurements at high multipoles , since cosmic variance prevents their resolution on scales probed by present balloon experiments . according to a recent analysis @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , cmb temperature measurements by the planck satellite experiment will be able to provide a measure of the relativistic energy density with a precision of about @xmath31 , without any strong prior on the other cosmic parameters .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in  @xcite , the situation is more promising if polarization measurements will be available , and some stronger priors are imposed on other cosmological parameters , enforced for example by independent measurements . in this case , @xmath32 would be determined with an accuracy comparable or , according to  @xcite , even higher than the order of magnitude of the effects we are here considering .",
    "we notice that in the cmb data analysis the presence of a non vanishing @xmath33 is already considered with , for example , a recommended default value for three massless active neutrinos @xmath4 in the cmbfast code @xcite .",
    "a precise check of this important parameter is therefore mandatory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : nuheating ] we summarize the set of equations and our numerical approach to compute the neutrino distortion due to their incomplete decoupling during the @xmath1 annihilation phase . in section [ sec : qed ] we also consider the corrections to the equation of state of @xmath2 and @xmath11 plasma due to qed effects at finite temperature , showing how these effects modify the numerical computation of section [ sec : nuheating ] , and we present our results .",
    "we also discuss the general case of extra relativistic degrees of freedom and of massive active neutrinos in section [ sec : extra ] .",
    "finally our conclusions are reported in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "the effects of non - instantaneous neutrino decoupling have been addressed in several studies , either based on analytical methods  @xcite , on numerical analysis with some simplifying approximations @xcite , or finally on full numerical computations , which solve the boltzmann equations until neutrinos are completely decoupled @xcite .",
    "the procedure is easily summarized . following the notation of  @xcite , a convenient choice for the _ time _ variable is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the scale factor of the universe ( chosen to have dimension of length ) and @xmath36 some reference mass , taken to be the electron mass as in  @xcite .",
    "we also introduce the dimensionless comoving momentum @xmath37 , and the rescaled photon temperature @xmath38 . in this notation",
    ", the boltzmann equations for the neutrino distributions can be written in the form @xmath39 \\,\\ , , \\label{boltz}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the hubble parameter , while @xmath41 represents the collisional integral , in momentum space @xmath42 , for the single neutrino specie @xmath43 , and is a functional of all neutrinos and electron / positron distributions are kept in thermodynamical equilibrium with @xmath11 by the electromagnetic interactions , they have fermi  dirac distributions and share the same temperature of photons , @xmath8 .",
    "we neglect the completely irrelevant @xmath1 asymmetry . ] . for the processes of interest ( see  @xcite for the detailed calculation ) , some of the integrations appearing in the @xmath41 can be analytically performed , and the collisional integrals can be reduced to two - dimensional integrals . in the range of temperatures we are interested in , electron neutrinos experience charged current interactions due to the presence of @xmath1 in the thermal bath , while all active neutrino flavours interact via neutral current interactions .",
    "for this reason , the nonequilibrium corrections to the distribution function @xmath44 are different from those of the other two neutrino species @xmath45 ( @xmath46 denoting both @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .    the two boltzmann equations for @xmath44 and @xmath45 must be supplemented by the continuity equation @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the energy density and pressure of the @xmath54 plasma .",
    "( [ energy ] ) can be rewritten as an evolution equation for the quantity @xmath55 which gives the ratio @xmath10 . in case of instantaneous neutrino decoupling , the asymptotic value of @xmath56 , denoted by @xmath57 , results to be the well - known value @xmath58 .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite the unknown neutrino distributions are parametrized as @xmath59   \\ , , \\label{expan}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 are orthonormal polynomials with respect to the fermi function weight @xmath61 by substituting eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ boltz ] ) , one gets @xmath62 \\,\\ , . \\label{eqc}\\ ] ] since at high temperature the neutrinos are in thermal equilibrium , the initial condition for the coefficients is @xmath63 .    to perform the numerical computation it is necessary to truncate the infinite series in eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) at some finite value @xmath64 , where the choice of @xmath64 depends on the accuracy we do require on the results ; it is found in  @xcite that @xmath65 gives an accuracy of about @xmath66 in the neutrino distortions . in this case , the asymptotic value found for @xmath56 , denoted by @xmath67 , slightly differs from the instantaneous decoupling result @xmath68 @xmath69 the final neutrino distribution functions show a non thermal behaviour due to the presence of non vanishing ripple terms .",
    "having fixed @xmath65 , we rewrite the expression of eq .",
    "( [ expan ] ) in the form @xmath70 and report the final values for the coefficients @xmath71 in table [ coeff ] . by using eq .",
    "( [ simple - expan ] ) it is now immediate to compute the additional contribution to the neutrino energy density due to incomplete decoupling . defining    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we now consider the possibility that , at the stage of neutrino decoupling , there are extra relativistic degrees of freedom , provided by some @xmath72 field excitations , which are assumed to have a thermal distribution with some temperature @xmath73 .",
    "their contribution @xmath20 to the total energy density of the universe can be parametrized in terms of an additional contribution @xmath32 in the effective number of neutrinos , as defined in eq .",
    "( [ neff - def ] ) @xmath74 where @xmath75 and we have defined @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter @xmath77 depends on the spin ( @xmath78 for a real scalar , @xmath79 for a weyl spinor , etc . ) as well as on the additional internal degrees of freedom of the @xmath72 particles .",
    "notice that if the @xmath72 excitations have decoupled between @xmath80 and @xmath1 annihilation phases we simply have @xmath81 .",
    "for an earlier decoupling we have instead @xmath82 .",
    "the presence of @xmath20 , apart from introducing a new contribution to @xmath0 , slightly affects the results obtained in the previous sections , namely the relative change of neutrino energy density @xmath83 induced by incomplete neutrino decoupling , as well as the asymptotic photon temperature @xmath67 . in fact since their energy density increases the expansion rate of the universe , we expect @xmath84 to decrease with growing @xmath85 , and the ratio @xmath86 to become closer to unity , since neutrino decoupling process starts at earlier times .",
    "if we denote with @xmath87 and @xmath88 the new values for these parameters as functions of @xmath85 we therefore have @xmath89 since we are interested to those contributions to @xmath0 corresponding to species which are relativistic for temperatures in the @xmath90 range , we can severely bound @xmath32 using the results from bbn , which leads to the conservative bound @xmath91 ( see for example @xcite for a recent analysis ) . using our numerical code",
    "we have evaluated how @xmath92 and @xmath93 change when @xmath85 varies in the range @xmath94 . in this interval , with an accuracy of @xmath95 on @xmath0 , we find @xmath96 with @xmath97 and where now both @xmath86 and @xmath98 in this expression are those reported in the last column of table 3 , i.e. with @xmath99 .",
    "the changes of these parameters with @xmath85 is encoded in an additional term , which is weighted by the small parameter @xmath100 .",
    "it should be clear from what we said before that only species which are relativistic at the neutrino decoupling , down to the @xmath2 annihilation stage , contributes for this extra term .",
    "it is known that the effective number of neutrinos at later stages , as for example at recombination , is much less constrained from data @xcite and it is still possible the case that energy density in the form of relativistic plasma may be injected only well after the big bang nucleosynthesis epoch .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath0 may well be rather different at the cmb and bbn epochs . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ neffxapprox ] ) at recombination reads @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the contribution of species which are relativistic at the bbn and neutrino decoupling , and recombination epochs , respectively .",
    "we finally consider the case of massive active neutrinos .",
    "this nowadays plausible scenario affects , in general , both the expectations for cmb anisotropy and large scale structure formation .",
    "as it is seems more and more clear from neutrino experiments on solar and atmospheric neutrinos , it is unlikely that neutrino mass differences may be greater than @xmath104 ev @xcite , unless we enlarge the standard scenario introducing sterile neutrino states . at the same time , it is also quite well established from tritium decay data that @xmath105 mass is bound to be smaller or , at most , of the order of @xmath106 ev .",
    "it is therefore clear that in this scenario all neutrino masses are completely negligible as far as their decoupling is concerned .",
    "however if their values is as large as @xmath107 ev , they start to be relevant as the temperature approaches the range relevant for cmb , and the presence of a finite mass modify of course the neutrino contribution to @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to consider how the effects of incomplete decoupling and qed thermal effects studied in the previous section would now affect the neutrino energy density .",
    "this is conveniently parametrized by the ( time dependent ) quantity @xmath108 which is defined as in section 2 , but for a neutrino with a finite mass @xmath109 .",
    "since for @xmath110 ev active neutrino are fully relativistic for temperatures of the order of @xmath90 , so we can still take at the @xmath1 annihilation phase the results of section 3 , it is easy to see that @xmath111 is given by @xmath112    in figure 1 , we plot @xmath113 for the reference choice @xmath114 ev , using the coefficients @xmath71 of table 2 .",
    "the @xmath46 range corresponds to a variation of the temperature from @xmath115 kev till @xmath116 ev .",
    "we see that the effect of incomplete decoupling and qed plasma masses for @xmath1 and @xmath11 on neutrino energy density decreases as the temperature becomes comparable with the value of the neutrino mass .",
    "notice that , from ( [ deltarhomass ] ) , at very low values of @xmath8 , when the neutrino energy is dominated by the mass term , @xmath117 reaches an asymptotic value , which is given by the change in the neutrino number density due to the above effects , normalized with the number density for a pure thermal fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "in this paper we have considered how the two effects due to incomplete neutrino decoupling and qed corrections to the @xmath1 and photon plasma equation of state affect the effective neutrino degrees of freedom , a crucial parameter for many cosmological observables .",
    "the main result of our analysis , which have been carried out by numerically solving the set of boltzmann equations describing neutrino decoupling , is a value for @xmath118 , for the standard case of three active neutrino flavours .",
    "the issue is certainly not new , but we hope our study will contribute to reach a better accuracy in the theoretical determination of relativistic energy density of the universe . in particular we have stressed that there is quite an interesting interplay between the two effects we have considered , so that at the level of accuracy of @xmath119 on @xmath0 , their corrections to the neutrino energy density can not be naively summed as they were fully independent .",
    "we have also considered the less standard scenario of extra species contributing to @xmath0 , and how they affect the calculation of the thermal distortion of neutrino distribution , as well as the final value for photon temperature after the @xmath1 annihilation phase .    despite of the smallness of the corrections",
    "we have been concerned with in this paper , nevertheless a careful analysis of data on the cmb anisotropy spectrum at large multipoles may be able in the near future to reveal their effects . estimated sensitivity of planck satellite experiment to relativistic energy density is at least of the order of @xmath120 , but it is strongly improved , @xmath121 @xcite , when including polarization measurements and strong priors .",
