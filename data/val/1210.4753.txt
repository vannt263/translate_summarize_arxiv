    "in the celebrated paper @xcite of seymour , motivated by the pluperfect and ( weak ) perfect graph theorems for the set covering problem by fulkerson and lovsz , he introduced the concept of so - called `` the max - flow - min - cut property '' of clutters , which is the packing counterpart of the totally dual integrality built in the perfection .",
    "that is , a clutter @xmath6 has the _ max - flow - min - cut property _ ( the mfmc property , for short ) if , for its clutter matrix @xmath7 , the linear system @xmath8 is totally dual integral .",
    "( a matrix inequality @xmath9 ( resp . to @xmath10 ) is called _ totally dual integral _ if the linear program @xmath11 ( resp . to @xmath12 ) has an integral optimal dual solution @xmath13 for every integral cost vector @xmath14 for which the above linear program has a finite optimum . ) in the case of the anti - blocking polytope of a clutter matrix , its integrality and the totally dual integrality of its linear system are coincident with the perfection .",
    "seymour also pointed out that this `` obvious analog '' of the set covering problem is false for the set packing problem , because there exists a non - mfmc clutter @xmath15 whose blocking polyhedron @xmath16 is integral ( i.e. _ ideal _ ) . on the other hand",
    ", he proved that this @xmath17 is the only ideal binary clutter which is minimally non - mfmc as the meaning of clutter minor .",
    "a clutter @xmath6 has the _ packing property _",
    "_ packs _ ) if the both sides of the linear programming equation @xmath18 have optimal solution integral vectors @xmath19 and @xmath13 for all cost vectors @xmath20 with components equal to @xmath21 or @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "when @xmath23 ) .",
    "lehman @xcite proved that the packing property implies the idealness .",
    "however , the converse is false because the ideal clutter @xmath17 does not pack and hence does not have the packing property . by definition ,",
    "the mfmc property implies the packing property .",
    "but how about the converse ?",
    "in 1993 , conforti and cornujols @xcite proposed the following famous conjecture .",
    "[ c&c ] a clutter has the packing property if and only if it has the mfmc property .    despite its natural appearance ,",
    "this conjecture is very difficult and still open .",
    "the existing approaches can be classified roughly into two categories :    the first category is to find a clutter class for which the conjecture is affirmative ( or , if possible , false ) .",
    "conjecture[c&c ] holds for the binary clutters @xcite , the diadic clutters @xcite , the clutter of circuits of a digraph @xcite , the clutter of cycles in an undirected graph @xcite , the broken circuit clutter of two - dimension affine convex geometries @xcite , the ehrhart clutters @xcite , and so on",
    ". however , for the almost all of them , except for the case of the binary clutters shown in the seymour s initial paper @xcite , the mfmc property is coincident with not only the packing property but also the idealness . in other words , there are only minimally non - ideal excluded clutter minors for these classes to have the mfmc property",
    ". of course , there are several known clutter classes , other than the binary clutters , on which the packing property is not coincident with the idealness .",
    "( it is well known that the clutter of dijoins @xcite falls into the case .",
    "see also @xcite for another example . ) however , as far as the authors know , conjecture[c&c ] seems unsettled even if restricted to each of these classes . to begin with , there are so few clutter classes on which the packing property is characterized by the set of minimally excluded minors which inevitably includes some ideal clutters ( again , see @xcite ) .",
    "the second category is to investigate `` the packing property '' itself and extract key nature of the concept by which we can prove or disprove the conjecture .",
    "the first essential step on this line was achieved by cornujols , guenin and margot @xcite . starting with the discovery of @xmath17 @xcite ,",
    "there have been found numerous ( and several infinite families of ) ideal minimally non - packing clutters until today ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all of these existing clutters have the common property : the blocking number is @xmath24 for all of them .",
    "cornujols , guenin and margot @xcite conjectured that the converse is also true .",
    "[ c&g&m ] the blocking number of every ideal minimally non - packing clutter is @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , they proved that the above conjecture implies conjecture[c&c ] .    in this paper",
    ", the authors will provide a framework to attack conjecture[c&g&m ] .",
    "tilde core _ of an ideal minimally non - packing clutter @xmath6 is the maximal set of hyperedges of @xmath6 such that every minimum transversal of @xmath6 has a unique common element with each of the hyperedges .",
    "as the concept of the _ core _ has greatly developed the theory of minimally non - ideal clutters ( see @xcite for details ) , the concept of the tilde core may have similar impact to the theory of ideal minimally non - packing clutters .",
    "actually , cornujols , guenin and margot @xcite proved that several key features of the ideal minimally non - packing clutters are controlled by their tilde cores .",
    "the authors will develop their idea to a framework to check whether a given clutter can be a tilde core of an ideal minimally non - packing clutter or not .",
    "this framework is useful not only for the search of counterexamples but also to prove the conjecture .",
    "we demonstrate this by applying our framework to the case of a special clutter , namely , the combinatorial affine planes .",
    "we show that every combinatorial affine plane whose blocking number is at least 3 can not be a tilde core of any ideal minimally non - packing clutter ( theorem [ thm : affinenon ] ) . in connection with this",
    ", we should note that whether a combinatorial projective plane except for the fano plane @xmath25 can be a core of a minimally non - ideal clutter or not is a famous open question of the theory of minimally non - ideal clutters ( see question@xmath26 in @xcite ) .",
    "we consider conjecture [ c&g&m ] in this paper .",
    "that is , we consider the ( non-)existence problem of an ideal minimally non - packing clutter of blocking number at least 3 .",
    "we propose a new framework to attack the conjecture .",
    "let @xmath27 be a finite ground set of clutters throughout this paper .",
    "@xmath1 denotes the set of hyperedges in a clutter @xmath2 each of which intersects any minimum transversal in exactly one element .",
    "a tilde clutter @xmath1 was first introduced in cornujols , guenin and margot @xcite .",
    "that paper gave necessary conditions for @xmath2 to be an ideal minimally non - packing clutter in terms of @xmath1 . in our paper , we develop their idea .",
    "we contrive tractable necessary conditions for @xmath2 to be an ideal minimally non - packing clutter in terms of @xmath1 . by our approach , clutters that we have to consider are restricted .",
    "we divide the ( non-)existence problem of an ideal minimally non - packing clutter @xmath3 as in conjecture [ c&g&m ] into two steps . in the first step ( section [ sec : tilde ] ) , we give necessary conditions for @xmath4 when @xmath5 is an ideal minimally non - packing clutter .",
    "we call a clutter satisfying the conditions in the step 1 a precore clutter . in the second step ( section [ sec : solution ] ) , for a precore clutter @xmath2 , we consider whether @xmath2 has an ideal minimally non - packing clutter @xmath3 with @xmath4",
    ". since the necessary conditions in step 1 are rather strong , clutters that we have to consider are much confined .",
    "however , we found a several classes of precore clutters .",
    "when we try to find a counterexample or prove the conjecture , we have only to consider the problem for each precore clutter @xmath2 .",
    "that is , it is the problem for @xmath2 to have an ideal non - minimally non - packing clutter @xmath3 with @xmath4 . starting with a ( rather vague ) task to find a counterexample to conjecture [ c&g&m ] , here , we obtain a tractable concrete problem whether a given clutter @xmath2 has an ideal non - minimally non - packing clutter @xmath3 with @xmath4 or not .",
    "section [ sec : tilde ] is devoted to step 1 .",
    "for an ideal non - packing clutter @xmath3 , we present several necessary conditions of @xmath28 : the integral blocking condition , tilde - invariance , the integrality of @xmath29 , and non - separability ( theorem [ thm : step1 ] ) .",
    "the integral blocking condition is defined as the coincidence of the fractional packing number and the blocking number .",
    "this condition is a fundamental condition as a premise of an argument . a clutter @xmath2 satisfying the integral blocking condition is called tilde - invariant if @xmath30 holds . for an ideal clutter @xmath2 , @xmath1 is tilde - invariant .",

    "the minimum transversals define the affine hull of @xmath32 and some non - minimum transversals define facets of @xmath32 . by observing these transversals carefully",
    ", we can derive useful information from them .",
    "cornujols , guenin and margot @xcite proved that deleting all the elements on a hyperedge of an ideal minimally non - packing clutter decreases the blocking number by at least two .",
    "we call such a condition hyperedge - nonseparability",
