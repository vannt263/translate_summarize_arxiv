    "according to the current standard cosmological model , the dynamics of the universe would be dominated by two unknown components : dark - matter ( dm ) , responsible for structure formation , and dark - energy ( de ) , that causes the accelerated expansion .",
    "although there are several candidates for both dm and de , there is still no evidence of either of them in laboratory physics . from the point of view of simplicity",
    ", it would be interesting to explore the possibility that a single component plays the role of both de and dm , reducing from two to one the unknown constituents of the universe .",
    "a model that provides a single description of de and dm through unifying - dark - matteror simply quartessence @xcite has attracted a lot of interest recently . a prototype of this model is given by the quartessence chaplygin model ( qcm ) @xcite .    both the background and linear fluctuations were extensively studied for qcm , and were compared to observational data .",
    "the generalized chaplygin gas ( as quartessence ) appears to be compatible with all available data regarding the expansion history ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . for adiabatic perturbations ,",
    "a linear analysis was done for the cmb @xcite  and lss @xcite . in this case , only qcm models close to the `` @xmath0cdm limit '' are allowed .",
    "recently , it was shown that problems ( pointed out in @xcite ) , such as the existence of instabilities and oscillations in the matter power spectrum of qcm , can be avoided if a specific type of intrinsic entropy perturbation is considered .",
    "such non - adiabatic model is consistent with the 2df power spectrum for any value of the model parameters in the permitted interval , as long as the effective shape parameter assumes certain values @xcite .",
    "an averaging problem  was also pointed out as a shortcoming of quartessence @xcite .",
    "however , it is straightforward to show that the above mentioned non - adiabatic quartessence does not suffer this kind of problem @xcite .",
    "thus , up to the present time , we can say that adiabatic quartessence is disfavored by the data , but it is not possible to distinguish non - adiabatic quartessence from concordance models like @xmath1cdm and quintessence using the previously considered observables .",
    "however , as we shall see , measurable differences in the predictions of these models appear clearly in the nonlinear regime , in particular in the skewness of the matter distribution in large scales . in our investigation",
    "we specifically consider three different quartessence models .",
    "all of them have the @xmath1cdm model as a limiting case for the background solution .",
    "the analysis of these three cases indicates that our result should be applicable to more generic quartessence models .    while most studies of the nonlinear regime deal with the clumping of pressureless fluid ( dm ) , in the case of quartessence it is imperative that one includes the effects of pressure .",
    "accordingly , we apply , and somewhat extend to include relativistic pressure , a method for the computation of density cumulants developed in refs . @xcite .",
    "in our approach we consider the following newtonian - like equations @xcite @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 equations ( [ poisson ] ) , ( [ euler ] ) and ( [ cont ] ) are , respectively , the poisson , euler and energy conservation equations , where relativistic effects of pressure ( inertia and active gravitational mass ) have been included . in these equations",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 stand for , the energy density , pressure , velocity field , and gravitational potential of the cosmic fluid , and we take @xmath9 . in the linear regime , for @xmath10 ( see bellow ) , system ( [ poisson]-[cont ] ) gives exactly the same equations as the relativistic perturbation theory in a particular gauge @xcite .",
    "also the ( nonlinear ) energy conservation and the raychadhuri equations derived from this system are formally identical to the general relativistic ones @xcite in this case , which provides a motivation for the above system .",
    "it is useful to split the dynamical variables into their background and inhomogeneus parts , i.e. we write : @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 . here",
    "@xmath15 is the hubble parameter , @xmath16 stands for the scale factor , and the overbar `` @xmath17 '' denotes background ( average ) quantities . introducing comoving coordinates @xmath18 , neglecting shear and vorticity , and taking into account the background equations ( assuming critical density ) , we obtain , after some algebra , the following differential equation for the density contrast @xmath19 ,    @xmath20- { \\delta ' } ^2 \\left [ \\frac{4/3+c_{eff}^2}{1+w+\\delta(1+c_{eff}^2)}\\right]\\nonumber \\right . \\\\ & & \\left . + \\delta \\delta ' \\left [ \\frac{(w - c_{eff}^2)(5 + 3c_{eff}^2)-{c_{eff}^2}'}{1+w+\\delta(1+c_{eff}^2)}\\right]+ \\delta ^2 \\left [ \\frac{3(w - c_{eff}^2){c_{eff}^2 } ' -3(w - c_{eff}^2)^2}{1+w+\\delta(1+c_{eff}^2)}-\\frac32(1 + 3c_{eff}^2)(1+c_{eff}^2)\\right]\\nonumber \\right .",

    "of special interest is the second - order equation .",
    "if we start with gaussian initial conditions , it is associated with the emergence of non - gaussian features in the matter density field .",
    "further , @xmath31 can be related to the skewness of the cosmic field @xcite . in this case ,",
    "the unsmoothed skewness is given by @xmath34 .",
    "we now consider the following quartessence models : @xmath35 when @xmath36 , all the models above have @xmath0cdm as a limiting case for the background . at first and",
    "higher order in perturbation theory , however , these quartessence models with @xmath36 , have distinct behavior as compared to that of dark - matter in @xmath0cdm .    in figs .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 we show contours of constant skewness values at present time for the above models . in our numerical computation , we consider that at @xmath40 , the growing modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 assume the einstein - de sitter behavior : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and such that @xmath43 at that time .",
    "we also include in the figures two curves with constant effective matter density parameter ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) . here , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the present value of the background energy density .",
    "we should expect the region between these two curves to be , roughly , the one allowed by current observational data .",
    "for instance , in @xcite it was shown that , for qcm , constraints from cluster x - ray data ( that are the most restrictive ones ) , essentially correspond to these curves .",
    "the same holds for the other quartessence models . from the figures it is clear that , for all the considered models , the skewness in these regions assumes values between @xmath48",
    "this strongly contrasts with what is expected in @xmath0cdm and quintessence , where one obtains @xmath49 , weakly sensitive to the cosmological parameters @xcite .    at first sight",
    "this difference could be interpreted as an indication that quartessence models are inconsistent with large - scale skewness measurements @xcite .",
    "however , care should be taken when analyzing this issue .",
    "whereas in the discussion above baryons were neglected , measurements of skewness from large - scale galaxy distribution , are based on counting luminous objects , not the dark component . eqs .",
    "( 1)-(5 ) can be easily generalized to include baryons @xcite .",
    "the main outcome is that the quartessence skewness is not substantially affected by the presence of a small amount ( @xmath50 ) of baryons , but on the other hand , the baryonic skewness ( @xmath51 ) is nearly constant with redshift , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , again baryons behave differently from the dark component as in the adiabatic quartessence power - spectrum case @xcite .",
    "we remark that this holds even for @xmath53 .",
    "further investigation is necessary to clarify to what extent do skewness measurements from galaxy distribution constrain quartessence models . although more challenging to observe , a potentially powerful probe is the lensing ( convergence ) skewness @xcite , that is sensitive to both baryons and quartessence . according to @xcite",
    "current lensing observations are still too noisy to allow strong constraints on cosmological parameters . on the other hand , as discussed above , quartessence predictions for the skewness are quite different from @xmath0cdm models and its variants .",
    "thus , we expect that present and upcoming data might discriminate among these two classes of models .    in the present work , we have not quantitatively compared quartessence predictions with observations .",
    "our goal here is more modest ; we essentially use figs .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 to stress out the important fact that non - adiabatic quartessence and concordance models like @xmath0cdm and quintessence could be observationally distinguished by skewness measurements .",
    "we leave this investigation for a future work @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that our results do not apply straightforwardly to quartessence models with a scalar field with , for instance , a non - canonical kinetic term @xcite , but these models have yet to be tested against background and power spectrum data .",
