    "characterising the different forms of correlations shared by the constituents of a composite quantum system is essential for the theoretical understanding and for the operational exploitation of the quantum system itself @xcite .",
    "correlations which can not be amenable to a classical description , in particular , exhibit a rich variety in mixed states of bipartite and multipartite quantum systems .",
    "nowadays , the notion of quantum correlations refers not only to entanglement , but to more general forms of correlations which are conventionally identified with the quantum discord @xcite , and capture for instance the necessary disturbance induced on quantum states by any local measurement ( which is nonzero even in all separable states apart from so - called classical - quantum states ) .",
    "correspondingly , the portion of correlations which are left in the state after a minimally disturbing local measurement can be identified with the classical correlations originally shared by the subsystems .    unlike entanglement , for which a resource theory is well established @xcite , proposals to quantify quantum and classical correlations in this more general paradigm are still relatively scarce , and the mathematical requirements that any such proposal has to obey to be regarded as a valid measure are still to be completely formalised @xcite . yet",
    "an interesting phenomenology associated to these correlations is being uncovered in different physical contexts .",
    "for example , from a foundational perspective the sudden transition from a decay to a plateau regime for classical correlations between a quantum system and its measurement apparatus has been interpreted as characterising the finite - time emergence of the pointer basis in the apparatus  @xcite . moreover , quantum correlations between noninteracting qubits have been shown to dynamically revive despite of decoherence thanks to memory effects of the local environment , independently of the quantum or classical nature of the environment  @xcite .",
    "quantum correlations of ground states also appear to play an important role in the characterisation of exotic phases of quantum many - body systems  @xcite . more generally , from an operational viewpoint various forms of quantum correlations , including and beyond entanglement , can and typically do provide fundamental resources for quantum technologies  @xcite . consequently , rigorously addressing the quantification of correlations is of paramount importance .    the notion of distance defined on the convex set of states of a quantum system",
    "paves the way for several geometric approaches to the quantification of correlations  @xcite .",
    "we refer in particular to refs .",
    "@xcite for a comparison among these approaches with respect to the quantification of quantum correlations . in this paper",
    ", we focus on bipartite systems and we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , according to which the minimum distance between a state @xmath0 and the set of states that do not possess a particular kind of correlations is a quantifier of that kind of correlations .",
    "hence , the minimum distances between the state @xmath0 of a bipartite system and the sets of product , classical - quantum and separable states represent , respectively , the amount of total correlations , quantum correlations and entanglement of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , the minimum distance between the set of closest classical - quantum states to @xmath0 and the set of product states represents the classical correlations of @xmath0 .",
    "this geometric approach to the quantification of correlations manifests several appealing features .",
    "first , it is unifying , thus allowing for a direct comparison among all the above mentioned notions of correlations @xcite .",
    "second , it readily suggests generalisations to the multipartite setting  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we use specifically the bures distance on the set of states to define geometric quantifiers of correlations .",
    "the bures distance is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath0 and @xmath2 are two arbitrary states while @xmath3 is the uhlmann fidelity @xcite @xmath4}^2.\\ ] ] the reason for choosing this distance instead of others stems from its quite peculiar , but desirable , properties .",
    "bures distance is at the same time contractive under completely positive trace - preserving maps , locally riemannian and its metric coincides with the quantum fisher information  @xcite , thus playing a crucial role in high precision interferometry and quantum metrology .",
    "moreover , the minimum bures distance between a state @xmath0 and the set of classical - quantum states is simply related to the maximal success probability in the ambiguous quantum state discrimination of a family of states and prior probabilities depending on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the task of minimal error quantum state discrimination plays a fundamental role both in quantum communication and cryptography and has been realised experimentally using polarised light @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "e.g. , the hilbert - schmidt distance is locally riemannian but not contractive  @xcite , the trace distance is contractive but not locally riemannian  @xcite and the relative entropy , although widely used in information theory , is technically not even a proper distance as it is not symmetric @xcite .    here",
    "we derive closed formulae for classical and total correlations of bell - diagonal states of two qubits according to the bures distance . together with the known corresponding formulae for entanglement  @xcite and discord - type quantum correlations  @xcite , these allow us to gain a complete and unifying view of bures correlations for bell - diagonal states .",
    "we then provide two applications of these results .",
    "we first report the explicit expressions of the bures correlations for two special subclasses of bell - diagonal states , namely werner states and rank-2 bell - diagonal states . finally , we consider a dynamical system made of two independent qubits locally interacting with a bosonic non - dissipative channel and",
    "show that both quantum and classical correlations measured by bures distance can alternatively freeze during the evolution , joining the ranks of other faithful correlation quantifiers @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the freezing analysis was addressed in ref .",
    "@xcite with similar methods for the trace distance , but with a different definition of classical correlations .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : quantumcorrelations ] we review some known results concerning bures quantum correlations and entanglement of bell - diagonal states . in sections",
    "[ sec : classicalcorrelations ] and [ sec : totalcorrelations ] we provide , respectively , the closed formulae for bures classical and total correlations of bell - diagonal states . in section [ sec : examples ] we compute the correlations of two particular classes of bell - diagonal states , i.e. , werner states and rank-2 bell - diagonal states . in section",
    "[ sec : dynamics ] we analyse the dynamics of correlations between two noninteracting qubits initially prepared in a bell - diagonal state and subject to identical local pure dephasing channels .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a summary and outlook .",
    "quantum correlations stem from two peculiar ingredients of quantum mechanics , the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the hilbert space associated to a composite quantum system .",
    "they are completely characterised by entanglement in the case of pure states , whereas in the case of mixed states entanglement constitutes only a part of the quantumness of correlations  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "for any pair of comparable quantifiers of general quantum correlations and entanglement , the quantum correlations of a state should intuitively be always greater or equal to the corresponding entanglement , being equal if the state is pure @xcite .",
    "this is nicely captured by the aforementioned geometric approach .",
    "specifically , in this paper , the quantum correlations of a state @xmath0 are quantified by the minimum bures distance of @xmath0 to the set of classical - quantum states , namely @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the set of classical - quantum states , i.e. states of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 being a probability vector , @xmath9 an orthonormal basis of qubit @xmath10 and @xmath11 any state of qubit @xmath12 and @xmath13 is any of the closest classical - quantum states to @xmath0 .",

    "the class of bd states is particularly interesting : for instance , they include the well - known bell states and werner states @xcite and constitute a resource for entanglement activation and distribution @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proven that , according to the bures distance , one of closest classical - quantum states to a bd state @xmath0 is always a bd classical - quantum state of the form @xmath30 where the index @xmath31 is such that @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 as a result , the closed expression for the quantum correlations of an arbitrary bd state , as quantified by the bures distance , is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 we now make some important remarks .",

    "( [ classicalcorrelationsdefinition ] ) represents an important improvement over previous attempts to quantify classical correlations geometrically @xcite .",
    "in fact , without the inclusion of the additional minimisation over all the closest classical - quantum states to @xmath0 , a measure of classical correlations might be ill - defined , as the distances between each closest classical - quantum state and their respective closest product states can generally differ .",

    "specifically , the dynamics of each qubit and the bosonic reservoir is governed by the following hamiltonian ( @xmath242 ) @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the qubit frequency , @xmath245 the frequencies of the reservoir modes , @xmath246 the pauli operator along the @xmath247-direction , @xmath248 the bosonic annihilation operators , @xmath249 the bosonic creation operators and @xmath250 the coupling constants between the qubit and each reservoir mode .",

    "this particular dynamics leads to paradigmatic _ freezing _ phenomena for both quantum and classical correlations , which can stay constant in certain time intervals despite the state physically changing ; this was originally reported by analysing entropic measures of correlations @xcite .",

    "it is worth noting that classical and quantum correlations exactly coincide at time @xmath270 , which is known as the instant of sudden transition from classical to quantum decoherence @xcite .",
    "this property also happens for correlations quantified by relative entropy @xcite and hilbert - schmidt distance @xcite . for correlations quantified by trace distance , although quantum and classical correlations alternately freeze in the same time intervals as the other measures @xcite , they are generally not coincident at the crossing time @xmath270 .",

    "we proved that the closest bell - diagonal classical - quantum state and the tensor product of the marginals of any bell - diagonal state achieve the infima in the definition of classical correlations .",
    "we have shown that the nearest uncorrelated state to every bell - diagonal state is not always the product of its marginals and that , in general , the total correlations are strictly smaller than the sum of quantum and classical correlations .",
    "these results are in agreement with those obtained with the trace distance @xcite but not with the hilbert - schmidt @xcite and relative entropy distances @xcite .",
    "finally , we have shown that , for two independent qubits under local bosonic pure - dephasing non - markovian channels and suitable initial conditions @xcite , bures distance quantifiers of correlations can also manifest : ( i ) the freezing of quantum correlations before a certain time @xmath270 and the freezing of classical correlations after the same time @xmath270 ; ( ii ) the indefinite freezing of quantum correlations notwithstanding the contemporary occurrence of entanglement sudden death .",
    "another peculiar feature of quantum but not classical geometric correlations , namely the possibility of double sudden changes ( under different dynamical conditions ) as observed theoretically and experimentally for trace distance quantifiers @xcite , has also been theoretically shown to occur for the bures measure of discord @xcite .",
    "overall , with the contributions brought forward by this paper , we have reached a fairly comprehensive understanding of the different components of correlations in generally mixed states of archetypical bipartite systems and their dynamical characteristics .",
    "experimental demonstrations with quantum optics and nuclear magnetic resonance setups @xcite have also verified the predicted resilience of classical and quantum correlations to particular decoherent evolutions .",
    "however , a satisfactory understanding of these phenomena from first principles is still missing .",
    "this is perhaps to be traced back to a still incomplete formalisation for the requirements that measures of classical and general quantum correlations have to satisfy @xcite .",
    "future work will be devoted to the theoretical and experimental understanding of the physical origin of the freezing under nondissipative decoherence common to any known _ bona fide _ measure of quantum correlations before a certain time @xmath270 ( including entropic , trace , bures , and skew - information based measures as studied in @xcite ) , and to any currently known _",
