    "interferometric setups are at the heart of several high - precision measurement schemes , ranging from gravitational wave - detectors to laser gyroscopes and clocks synchronization protocols . in particular ,",
    "a direct detection of gravitational waves is supposed to come from laser - interferometric detectors @xcite , where they induce a measurable variation of the optical paths of the light beams traveling along the arms of an interferometric setup .",
    "inteferometers are usually employed to detect small perturbations , so that detectors must be able to measure distance changes with remarkable precision and any source of noise must be carefully removed .",
    "indeed , recent technological advances in precision lasers , vacuum technology and optical systems had made it possible to greatly reduce classical noise .",
    "however , an unavoidable constraint to the precision with which optical signals can be measured arises from the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the so - called standard quantum limit ( sql ) @xcite , sometimes also referred to as _ shot noise _ , results as a consequence of the uncertainty relations existing for the quantum field operators .    a way to partially circumvent the effects of quantum fluctuations and increase interferometric precision",
    "is to exploit the use of squeezed light @xcite or other nonclassical states of light @xcite , also in the presence of inefficient detectors @xcite .",
    "the implementation of squeezing - enhancement techniques in interferometric detectors has been a great challenge : after a large number of experimental and theoretical studies it has now became possible to take advantage of squeezing @xcite so that the next generation of interferometers will be equipped with quantum technologies .    in order to effectively exploit the potential improvements offered by quantum signals , the statistical analysis of the data should be refined as well . in this context , the key point is to improve the ability of discriminating whether a signal contains instrumental noise only or also a trace of a signal .",
    "this problem , which arises in the form of a hypothesis testing problem @xcite , might be conveniently studied by means of bayesian inference @xcite . however , a bayesian approach may be challenging since it requires the full knowledge of the system under consideration in order to properly introduce a suitable prior , together with a high computational power .",
    "indeed , in a bayesian framework we have to provide explicit models of the signal induced by a perturbation to achieve , after specifying our prior knowledge , the odds ratio of the detection hypothesis over the null hypothesis , corresponding to absence of signal . in this context",
    ", it may happen that the lack of knowledge about the system increases the false alarm probability .",
    "in other words , the posterior odds may favor the alternative hypothesis , i. e. presence of perturbations , even if no signals are actually present in data .",
    "in particular , when a diffuse prior distribution is taken , a bayesian approach to hypothesis testing leads to conflicting evidences compared to a frequentist approach .",
    "such a counterintuitive situation was studied by jeffrey @xcite together with lindley , who first referred to this disagreement as a statistical paradox @xcite .",
    "the relevance of bayesian analysis in interferometry has been recognized since a long time @xcite .",
    "the interest raised for at least three reasons . on the one hand , common interferometric estimators are known to achieve optimal performances only at a specific working point @xcite , thus resulting in interferometric protocols that do not allow the measurement of arbitrary phase shifts . besides , in order to estimate small fluctuations around the working point , the interferometer has to be actively stabilized by the addition of some feedback mechanism @xcite . finally , bayesian estimators have been shown to achieve the asymptotic regime , where they saturate the cramer - rao bound , already with few measurements @xcite , thus representing a convenient choice in any setting where resources are limited or the samples involved in the interferometric setup are fragile .    in this work we address in details the occurrence of the _ lindley paradox _",
    "@xcite in the analysis of data coming from optical interferometry .",
    "the importance of the topic seats in the fact that often , e.g. in the framework of gravitational antennas , each event is of great relevance and should be analyzed in the most refined way as the above mentioned debate concerning cosmological measurements suggests .",
    "more generally , it is often the case that besides the estimation of small fluctuations , interferometric measurements are involved in monitoring a given physical configuration , where the information coming from the experimental data is exploited to statistically discriminate between two hypothesis @xcite . here ,",
    "we first consider homodyne detection , then classical - like mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer , and finally we consider the case of squeezed - enhanced quantum interferometers . for the mz interferometer",
    "we start from the analysis of the ideal case wherein the detectors are perfectly efficient , and a widespread prior is assumed , and then proceed by assessing the realistic case where inefficient detectors and a concentrated prior distribution is employed .",
    "as we will see , the lindley paradox may indeed arise in optical interferometry . here",
    "we show how to mitigate the conflict between the bayesian and frequentist approaches by using suitable priors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ s : lin ] we introduce the notation and illustrate how and when the paradox can arise . in sec .",
    "[ s : hd ] we discuss phase estimation by homodyne detection as a suitable example to illustrate the statistical analysis step by step . in sec .",

    "let us consider a random variable @xmath0 distributed according to a gaussian distribution of unknown mean @xmath1 and known variance @xmath2 .",
    "suppose that we want to test a sharp null hypothesis @xmath3 , corresponding to the prediction @xmath4 , against the alternative hypothesis @xmath5 , corresponding to the diffuse prediction @xmath6 . in a bayesian framework",
    "this is done assigning a priori a probability @xmath7 and a prior distribution @xmath8 to any hypothesis @xmath9 taken into account .",
    "let us denote the priors by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 $ ] . besides , we take @xmath13 to be a dirac s delta function since the null hypothesis involves a single parameter value . as for the probability density @xmath14 , concerning the alternative hypothesis , we assume a normal distribution with variance @xmath15 .",
    "that being said , the posterior probability @xmath16 that the outcome @xmath17 provides evidence of @xmath4 , i. e. confirms the null hypothesis , is evaluated via bayes theorem , which yields ( see [ a : pd ] ) : @xmath18 in order to illustrate the occurrence of the lindley paradox , let us consider the simple case where @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where we have ( see [ a : pd ] for the general case ) @xmath21 \\right\\ } ^{-1 } , % \\nonumber\\\\ % & { } \\stackrel{\\tau\\gg1}{\\simeq } 1-   % \\frac{1-z_0}{z_0}\\,e^{\\frac12 x^2}\\,\\frac1{\\tau}\\ , , \\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which goes to @xmath22 as @xmath23 goes to infinity , no matter the value of the outcome @xmath24 and of the prior probability @xmath25 .",
    "in other words , when the prior distribution for the alternative hypothesis becomes non - informative ( i.e. approaches a flat distribution ) , a bayesian approach awards high odds to the null hypothesis even if the observed value is several standard deviation away from @xmath26 .",
    "this is clearly in contrast with the predictions that any frequentist approach based on sampling theory may provide , not speaking of common sense .",
    "the nature of the paradox , actually the lack of any paradox , has been extensively analyzed @xcite and we are not going to discuss the situation from a statistical point of view , which would be beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "we limit ourselves to notice that the disagreement between the two approaches is basically caused by the fact that the frequentist approach tests one hypothesis without reference to the other , whereas bayesian analysis assess them as alternative one to each other , looking for the one in better agreement with the observations .",
    "we also point out that the paradox is of great generality since the key point for its appearance is the use of a diffuse prior distribution . in the following sections",
    ", we will exhibit three situation of physical interest where the data analysis naturally involves the assignment of a prior , such that a discussion about the occurrence of the paradox is worthwhile .",

    "two detectors measure the photocurrents @xmath31 and @xmath32 , while a differential amplifier determines the _ homodyne photocurrent _ @xmath33 , i.e. the rescaled difference photocurrent @xmath34    homodyne detection provides the measurement of the quadrature operator @xmath35 given by : @xmath36 we point out that the device works properly only if the incoming fields occupy the same spatial mode , have the same frequency @xmath37 and are co - polarized . besides , note that our description refers to ideal photodetectors with quantum efficiency equal to @xmath22 .",
    "this being said , we address homodyne detection as a tool to establish whether the phase of a given initial field has been perturbed or not , e. g. due to interaction with the environment .",
    "in particular , we consider a squeezed state @xmath38 , with @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "that is , we take the impinging beam to be in a pure state given by : @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unitary operators , namely the _ squeezing operator _ and the _ displacement operator _ , whose action in the phase space defined by the observables @xmath35 and @xmath44 is , respectively , an hyperbolic rotation and a translation .",

    "the final state @xmath47 , impinging on the semi - reflecting mirror , is readily obtained using the bch formulas , which yield : @xmath48 the distribution @xmath49 of the outcomes of repeated measurements of @xmath35 performed on radiation prepared in state @xmath47 is a gaussian with expectation value @xmath50 and variance @xmath51 given by : @xmath52 @xmath53 \\ , .",

    "in order to provide a bayesian assessment for @xmath3 we set a value for the prior probability , say @xmath66 , and distribute uniformly the remainder probability @xmath67 over the interval @xmath68 $ ] , where the phase may take values .",
    "on one hand , we are allowed to set such a high value for @xmath25 under the assumption that we are leading an experiment in optimal conditions , any source of noise being taken into account . on the other hand , the choice of a flat prior should not be surprising since we have no idea about the dynamics of a possible interaction : we are equally ( un)expected to measure a small or a large value for the phase shift . eventually , the posterior probability @xmath69 that @xmath54 is is evaluated by the bayes theorem : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , \\label{eq:11}\\ ] ] @xmath72 .",

    "recalling that the null hypothesis corresponds to the condition @xmath54 we get @xmath77 and @xmath78 . by explicit calculations",
    "one can check that for @xmath79 the posterior probability is still over @xmath80 : a bayesian approach leads us to conclude that no phase perturbation actually occurred .",
    "that is , if @xmath81 the bayesian approach provides conflicting evidence with respect to the values obtained by a sampling test : we are in presence of the paradox .",
    "the key point , in the present case as well as in the situation illustrated by lindley , is that the prior is taken to be flat . to this regard",
    "we remark that despite this assumption is somehow consistent from a physical perspective , in practice it turns out that outcomes being several @xmath82 from the expectation value are associated to statistical fluctuations and the null hypothesis keeps on overwhelming any alternative .",
    "for this reason we shall rather conclude that the bayesian approach is somehow misleading if a scarce information about the prior distributions is available , whereas a sampling - theory test better accounts what is really happening .",
    "since our main goal is to address the occurrence of the lindley paradox in interferometry we will not go further in the discussion of this case .",
    "we only notice that here we have a physical example where the paradox unavoidably arises , the assumptions being consistent with the dynamics of the system . from a practical point of view , we notice that the characterization and the calibration of homodyne detectors is one of the building blocks for the robust implementation of quantum tomography of the radiation field @xcite .",
    "in the present section we consider the linear mz interferometer , that allows one to monitor a classical phase parameter via photon counting measurements . a schematic diagram of the detector is shown in fig .",

    "two modes of the radiation field enters the interferometer through a first beam splitter , then a phase difference @xmath1 is inserted between the beams and , finally , the two fields exit through a second beam splitter .",

    "the phase difference @xmath1 will vary and so will do the outcomes of measurements of the operator @xmath91 : once the system has been set in a proper initial working point @xmath26 an outcome @xmath6 shall be associated to a displacement .",
    "hence , the data analysis consists of assessing the probability that an outcome @xmath92 confirms the null hypothesis @xmath3 , corresponding to no phase variation , or the alternative hypothesis @xmath5 that @xmath6 . in this context",
    ", we discuss the possibility of coming across the lindley paradox , paying particular attention to the conditions in which it can arise .      at first",

    "the mean value @xmath97 and variance @xmath98 of the above distribution are given by @xmath99 @xmath100 this result may be easily understood recalling that the number of photons contained in a coherent state follows a poissonian statistics and that the skellam distribution provides the probability density of the difference between two poisson variates .",
    "it is easy to see that for the given input state @xmath47 the minimum value of @xmath88 is obtained for @xmath101 .",

    "we have addressed the occurrence of the so - called lindley paradox in the analysis of data coming from homodyne detection and optical interferometry .",
    "we found that the lindley paradox may indeed occur .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the bayesian approach is somehow misleading if a scarce information about the prior distributions is available , as it happens in the evaluation of the effect of an external perturbation , and sampling - theory should be preferred .",
    "concerning mz interferometers , we have shown that lindley paradox appears both for coherent and squeezed signals and is present for any value of the quantum efficiency of the involved detectors .",
    "on the other hand , the disagreement between bayesian and frequentist approach is less pronounced for increasing noise and may be softened by using a suitable , more localized , priors .    our results , besides being of fundamental interest for interferometry , are of practical significance for quantum state reconstruction , where calibration of homodyne detectors represents a crucial step for the implementation of quantum tomography @xcite .",

    "we perform a measurement of @xmath0 and on the basis of the outcome @xmath24 we want to test which of the two following hypothesis is true @xmath170 we assume to have some prior knowledge on the system , which may be expressed in form of some _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath171 and @xmath172 for the two hypothesis .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 is , in turn , intended to upgrade our knowledge of the system .",
    "given the result @xmath24 , bayes theorem says that @xmath173 for @xmath174 , where @xmath175 is the a priori probability introduced above , @xmath176 is the conditional distribution of the outcomes given a hypothesis , @xmath177 is the overall distribution of the outcomes , independently which hypothesis is actually true , and @xmath178 is the _ a posteriori _ probability of the hypothesis @xmath179 , i.e. the quantity of interest here . using the bayes theorem we may evaluate the a posteriori probabilities , e.g. @xmath180 is given by @xmath181^{-1 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\left[1 + \\frac{1-p(h_0)}{p(h_0 ) } \\frac{p(x|h_1)}{p(x|h_0 ) } \\right]^{-1 } \\ , , \\label{a3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , upon the substitutions @xmath182 and @xmath183 , coincides with eq .",

    "now , in order to evaluate explicitly the posterior distribution we assign some prior distribution @xmath184 to the mean value under the two hypothesis . according to ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) we write @xmath185 and assign the rest of the prior probability as a normal distribution with variance @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath186    it is now straightforward to evaluate the conditional probabilities as @xmath187 which leads to @xmath188^{-1/2 }   \\,e^{-(\\phi-\\phi_0)^2/2(\\sigma^2+\\tau^2)}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] overall , eq .",
