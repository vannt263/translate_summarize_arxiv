    "we consider a system consisting of four atomic ensembles located inside a high - finesse ring cavity .",
    "the cavity is composed of four mirrors that create two modes , called propagating and counter - propagating modes , to which the atomic ensembles are equally coupled .",
    "external pulse lasers that are used to drive the atomic ensembles couple to only a single propagating mode , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "we assume that the atoms are homogeneously distributed inside the ensembles . in this case",
    "only the forward scattering occurs that allows us to neglect the coupling of the atoms to the counter - propagating mode and work in the single mode approximation  @xcite . in other words ,",

    "the second line represents an intensity dependent ( stark ) shift of the atomic energy levels , and the third line represents the interaction between the cavity field and the atomic ensembles .",
    "the essential feature of the effective hamiltonian ( [ e2 ] ) is that the atoms interact dispersively with the cavity mode .",
    "this means that the cavity mode will remain unpopulated during the evolution .",
    "note the presence of nonlinear terms , @xmath46 , analogous to the counter - rotating terms , that will play the crucial role in creation of a squeezed state between the atomic ensembles .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ e2 ] ) is general in the parameter values . in what follows",

    "a standard way to obtain a cv cluster state is to entangle a number of field ( bosonic ) modes .",
    "therefore , we shall work in the field ( bosonic ) representation of the atomic operators and consider a procedure to entangle the corresponding number of the bosonic modes . in this approach , we make use of the holstein - primakoff representation  @xcite that transforms the collective atomic operators into harmonic oscillator annihilation and creation operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 of a single bosonic mode @xmath54 for the procedure considered here of the preparation of the cluster states , the mean number of atoms transferred to the states @xmath7 is expected to be much smaller than the total number of atoms in each ensemble , i.e. , @xmath55 . by expanding the square root in eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) and neglecting terms of the order of @xmath56 , the collective atomic operators can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath57 substituting these expressions into eq .",
    "( [ e2 ] ) and omitting the constant energy terms , we find that the effective hamiltonian can be simplified to the form @xmath58    we now consider the evolution of the system under the effective hamiltonian ( [ e7 ] ) including also a possible loss of photons due to the damping of the cavity mode . if the cavity mode is allowed to decay with a rate @xmath0 , the system then is determined by the density operator @xmath59 whose the time evolution satisfies the master equation @xmath60+l_a\\rho , \\label{e8}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 represents the damping of the field by the cavity decay  @xmath0 . choosing @xmath62 and @xmath63 appropriately allows for the preparation of the system in a desired state that then decays to its steady - state with the rate @xmath0 .",
    "note that we have ignored the damping of the atoms by spontaneous emission due to large detunings assumed in the derivation of the effective hamiltonian  ( [ e7 ] ) .",
    "the spontaneous emission rate due to off - resonant excitation is estimated at the rate @xmath64 that with the experimental values of @xmath65  mhz for a rubidium atom and @xmath66 gives @xmath67  hz .",

    "we will use different sequences of the laser pulses to drive the atomic ensembles and assume that all the atoms are initially in the lowest energy state @xmath6 .",
    "we now proceed to discuss the detailed procedure of the preparation of cv quadripartite cluster states of atomic ensembles located inside a single - mode ring cavity . in particular",

    "[ fig3 ] .        as a preface ,",
    "we briefly discuss how one could distinguish that a given state belongs to the class of cluster states .",
    "simply , a given state is quantified as a cluster state if the quadrature correlations are such that in the limit of infinite squeezing , the state becomes zero eigenstate of a set of quadrature combinations  @xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the position and momentum operators ( quadratures ) of a mode @xmath72 , and the modes @xmath73 are the nearest neighbors @xmath74 of the mode @xmath72 . in what follows , we quantify a given state as a cluster state by evaluating the variances of linear combinations of the momentum and position operators of the involved field modes .",
    "if the variances vanish in the limit of the infinite squeezing then , according to the above definition , a given state is a cluster state .",
    "let us first concentrate on the preparation of a four - mode linear cluster state involving four separate atomic ensembles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "as we shall see , the preparation process depends crucially on the specific choice of the rabi frequencies and phases of the driving laser fields .    in order to unconditionally prepare a linear cluster state involving four separate atomic ensembles and find its explicit form",

    "more concretely , for a cluster state , all the modes @xmath79 should be prepared in a squeezed vacuum state .",
    "we employ the fact that the modes can be separately prepared in the squeezed vacuum state . afterwards ,",

    "this is easy to understand , the master equation ( [ e18 ] ) represents two coupled modes with the cavity mode linearly damped with the rate @xmath0 .",
    "since the remaining modes @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 are decoupled from the mode @xmath87 , they remain in an undetermined state @xmath95 .    in order to estimate the required time to reach the steady state , we calculate eigenvalues of eq .",

    "once all the combined modes @xmath78 are prepared in the corresponding single - mode squeezed vacuum states , the explicit form of the state created can be obtained by reversing the unitary transformation @xmath117 .",

    "it can be done in four steps by appropriately choosing the laser parameters such as phases and intensities . then , by applying an inverse unitary transformation , the pure linear cv entangled state @xmath120 for the four atomic ensembles can be obtained .",
    "the question remains as to whether the state @xmath121 is an example of the linear cv cluster state . to examine this",
    ", we introduce the quadrature amplitude @xmath122 and phase @xmath123 components of the four modes involved , and easily find that the variances of the linear combinations of the components , evaluated according to the definition ( [ e10 ] ) , are @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",

    "having discussed the procedure of creation of a linear cluster state , we now proceed to describe the realization of an entangled cv square cluster state @xmath127 .",
    "the strategy is based on the same procedure used above for the preparation of the cv linear cluster state .",
    "a square cv cluster state may be obtained by performing a unitary transformation @xmath128 to obtain superposition modes determined by the following operators @xmath129    similar to the preparation of the cv linear cluster state for the four separated atomic ensembles , here we can make the interaction between the cavity and the four mode @xmath52 @xmath76 reduce to the coupling between the mode @xmath72 and one of the combined mode @xmath130 in the form of a combined linear mixing process by choosing proper parameters of lasers . after a long - time interaction @xmath99 , the cavity mode @xmath72 and the combined mode @xmath130 will respectively develop into the vacuum state and the squeezed vacuum state @xmath131 due to the cavity dissipation",
