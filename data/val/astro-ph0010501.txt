    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are very luminous objects whose emission is thought to be powered by the release of gravitational potential energy from matter falling into supermassive black holes .",
    "most agn physics beyond that simple statement are a matter of dispute at some level , as are many of the physical differences underlying the observed differences in the spectra of agn .",
    "one reason for at least part of our lack of understanding may be selection effects .",
    "most high - luminosity agn  quasars , with @xmath9  have been selected using rest - frame ultraviolet - optical colors .",
    "thus dust extinction has probably masked some portion of the dominant radio - quiet quasar ( rqq ) population from detection ( webster et al .",
    "important steps toward eliminating this bias are beginning to appear from near - ir selected samples ( e.g. from 2mass ; see cutri et al .",
    ", this volume ) and from x - ray selected samples ( kim & elvis 1999 ) .",
    "radio selection may not sample as distinct a population of agn as once thought , given the lack of bimodality in @xmath10 between rqqs and rlqs seen in the first bright quasar survey ( white et al .",
    "2000 ) , but much deeper radio surveys would be needed to select the majority of radio - quiet agn at redshifts @xmath11 .",
    "another important selection effect is that any single flux - limited sample of agn ( even a near - ir or x - ray selected one ) will exclude high - redshift , low - luminosity objects .",
    "this leads to a degeneracy between the redshift and luminosity dependences of any agn property .",
    "thus , bright quasar surveys need to be accompanied by faint quasar surveys to fill in the @xmath12@xmath13@xmath4 plane and remove the redshift  luminosity degeneracy , and to define the full quasar luminosity function .    at the moment",
    "optical color selection of agn is the method being used to assemble the largest samples of agn , namely 2.5@xmath1410@xmath15 objects from the 2df quasar survey ( 2qz ; boyle et al .",
    ", this volume ) and 10@xmath16 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "moderately deep wide - field optical imaging can provide the data needed for complementary faint color - selected quasar surveys .",
    "several surveys are underway which , despite their small size , will form useful comparisons to the 2df and sdss surveys ( agn will also turn up in faint galaxy surveys such as discussed by le fevre et al . , this volume ) .",
    "the eventual goal for optical quasar studies is to reach @xmath17 at all redshifts @xmath18 .",
    "the big throughput camera on the ctio 4-m ( wittman et al . 1998 ) offered the first opportunity to image the wide fields required for faint quasar surveys at @xmath20 .",
    "a group of quasar enthusiasts  julia kennefick ( caltech ) , pat osmer & eric monier ( ohio state ) , malcolm smith ( ctio ) , richard green ( noao ) and myself  have used the btc for two separate but complementary surveys .    in 19971999",
    ", we obtained 7 deg@xmath21 of @xmath22 imaging data for a big faint quasar survey .",
    "we expect to find @xmath23120 quasars at @xmath24 and @xmath2340 at @xmath25 via followup spectroscopy to @xmath26=23.5 . at these redshifts quasars have redder @xmath27 and bluer @xmath28 colors than the stellar locus .",
    "this survey will define the shape of the quasar luminosity function from @xmath29 at @xmath30 , and its evolution at @xmath31 , with accuracy equal to current knowledge for @xmath32 ( fan et al .",
    "a data paper is nearing submission ( hall et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , and we hope to begin spectroscopy in earnest in 2001 .    a second survey was also begun in 1997 to look for @xmath4@xmath335 quasars using @xmath34 imaging , dubbed btc40 for its coverage of 40 deg@xmath21 ( kennefick et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "a selection criterion of @xmath35 is sensitive to @xmath36 quasars and only the latest m dwarfs .",
    "however , the surface density of these very late m dwarfs is sufficiently high that they dominate candidates selected this way .",
    "thus we added @xmath37 band imaging to the survey to have two colors with which to distinguish @xmath36 quasars from stars .",
    "we expected anywhere from 1 to 25 @xmath36 quasars to @xmath38=22 in the survey .",
    "to date we have spectroscopically confirmed two @xmath39 quasars , but none at @xmath36 .",
    "part of this is the difficulty of following up @xmath40 candidates on 4-m class telescopes .",
    "our @xmath41 quasar surface density agrees with that found in the sdss ( fan et al .",
    "2000 ) , but we hope to extend our spectroscopy to lower luminosities using 8-m class telescopes in the near future .",
    "the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 ) obtained spectra for about 6200 galaxies to a nominal limit of @xmath26=21.5 . as a side benefit it yielded a sample of at least 47 agn with @xmath42 and average @xmath43 ( hall et al .",
    "2000 ) , spectroscopically selected by broad emission lines , nev emission , or feii absorption .",
    "at least 80% of the cnoc2 agn can be recovered by color selection , in agreement with previous , mostly smaller samples for which multiple selection methods were employed .",
    "this does not address the ability of optical flux - limited samples to recover agn which experience significant dust extinction , just the fraction of agn to a given optical flux limit which have colors sufficiently distinct from stars to be identified .",
    "note that @xmath2320% of these agn are classified as resolved or probably resolved ( in cfht seeing ) , a potential selection effect which must be considered in faint quasar surveys which target only unresolved objects .",
    "the cnoc2 agn include several unusual objects : one with a very strong double - peaked mgii emission line , one with the first recognized oiii@xmath53133 broad absorption line , and one with as yet unidentified emission and absorption lines .",
    "the broad emission line subsample of predominantly low - luminosity agn , although small , has some intriguing properties .",
    "it may have a higher incidence of associated mgii and civ absorption , possibly because such absorption is anti - correlated with optical luminosity or is becoming less frequent with cosmic time , or possibly because the sample is not biased against objects reddened by dust associated with the absorbing gas or with resolved spatial structure such as companions , tidal tails or large host galaxies , environments which may be more likely to have extensive gas envelopes which show up as associated absorption .",
    "the quite similar spectra of broad - line agn over a range of @xmath2310@xmath44 in luminosity implies that the parameters determining the emergent spectra scale nearly uniformly with luminosity . for a given line , an anticorrelation of emission line equivalent width with continuum luminosity  a baldwin effect ( beff )",
    " means that the scaling is not exactly homologous for that line . the broad emission line cnoc2 agn subsample has average equivalent widths ( @xmath45 ) for mgii@xmath52798 and ciii]@xmath51909 which agree with the predictions of previous studies of the beff , but as seen in figure 1 , the average @xmath45 for civ@xmath51549 and ly@xmath6 are smaller than predicted by previous studies of the beff at lower redshift",
    "this may imply that the slopes of the civ and ly@xmath6 baldwin effects evolve with redshift , steepening with cosmic time .",
    "other faint agn samples are consistent with these results , namely agn from the cfrs and hdf ( see figure 1 ) , spectroscopically selected agn from the cnoc1 cluster galaxy redshift survey , and low s / n spectra of agn from the deep multicolor survey ( osmer et al .",
    "a similar result was also reported by zitelli et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for civ , and by boyle et al .",
    "( this conference ) for more luminous 2qz quasars .",
    "a current favored model explains the beff as a result of the luminosity dependence of agn continuum spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , wherein more luminous agn have softer ionizing continua ( osmer & shields 1999 ) .",
    "evolution in the beff might indicate evolution with cosmic time of agn seds at a given luminosity , which might arise from evolution in the relation between agn luminosity and black hole mass ( wandel 1999 ) .",
    "however , an earlier model for the civ beff postulated a smaller ionization parameter @xmath46 ( the ratio of ionizing photon to gas densities ) in more luminous agn and predicted no ly@xmath6 beff ( shields & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "a @xmath46-@xmath12 anticorrelation has also been recently suggested on entirely independent grounds , namely to explain reverberation mapping results on a subsample of palomar - green agn ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) . given the theoretical implications , further data on high-@xmath4 low - luminosity agn from well - understood samples is needed to confirm our possible evidence for redshift evolution of the slope of the baldwin effect in ly@xmath6 and civ .",
    "the @xmath22 and @xmath48 color selection techniques used to identify @xmath49 and @xmath50 quasars , respectively , can be extended to @xmath51 quasars using @xmath52 imaging .",
    "we are conducting such a survey using data from the red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs ; gladders & yee 2000 and gladders , this conference ) , a 100 deg@xmath21 @xmath53 survey for @xmath54 galaxy clusters . as a side benefit ,",
    "this survey should yield a sample of several hundred t , l and m7m9 dwarfs .",
    "candidate @xmath51 quasars and brown dwarfs are identified to @xmath55 by requiring @xmath56 ; the only plausible contaminant at such colors is extremely luminous @xmath36 galaxies .",
    "@xmath57-band followup then separates the three populations : t dwarfs have red @xmath58 , l dwarfs have moderate @xmath58 , and @xmath47 quasars have blue @xmath58 ( figure 2 and zheng et al .",
    "2000 ) . in pilot",
    "@xmath57 imaging of 28 targets sparsely sampled from @xmath59 deg@xmath21 , we are 28 for 28 in confirming that our @xmath60 candidates are real and fall within the expected @xmath58 color ranges : 23 have colors of m7l8 dwarfs and 5 of l8 to t dwarfs ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the rcs can reach 22.5 magnitudes fainter than sdss or 2mass in its selection of candidate @xmath47 quasars and l and t dwarfs .",
    "this means fainter quasars ( and more of them ) and cooler brown dwarfs ( on average ) .",
    "the full 100 deg@xmath21 survey could yield anywhere from 0 to @xmath23100 @xmath47 quasars , as well as more than 50 t dwarfs and 450 l dwarfs ( dantona et al .",
    "large surveys of bright quasars need complementary surveys of faint quasars if redshift and luminosity dependences of various quasar properties are to be disentangled .",
    "together these surveys will enable study of the properties and evolution of quasars over the entire optically accessible @xmath18 range .",
    "the bfqs and btc40 surveys are first steps toward large faint quasar surveys , for which 4-m class telescopes can provide imaging and some spectroscopy , but for which 8-m class telescopes are needed for fainter candidates and detailed spectral studies .",
    "the rcs is an excellent database in which to look for low - luminosity @xmath61 quasars , using snapshot near - ir imaging to separate them from very late m , l and t dwarfs with similarly red @xmath62 colors .",
    "comparison of low - luminosity quasars from the cnoc2 survey to high - luminosity quasars at the same redshifts suggests an unexpected variation with redshift of the baldwin effect for civ and ly@xmath6 , illustrating the potential for surprises in the new era of wide - field astronomy .",
