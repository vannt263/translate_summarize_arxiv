    ", the interaction between these single - atom experiments is modelled by a classical field .",
    "although ignoring quantum phase fluctuations in the condensate , the wave nature of atoms is still contained in the gross - pitaevskii equation and dynamical tunnelling is a quantum effect that results from the wave nature of the atoms .",
    "the assumption for a common phase for the whole condensate is well justified for the experimental conditions as the timescales of the experiment and the lattice well depth are sufficiently small .",
    "it will be shown in the following ( see fig .  [ chap12fig25 ] ) that the kinetic energy is typically of the order of  @xmath43 hz which is much larger than the non - linear term in the gross - pitaevskii equation [ grossp ] which is on the order of  400 hz",
    ". the experimental results , in particular dynamical tunnelling could therefore be modelled by a single particle schrdinger equation in a one - dimensional single well with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "theoretical analysis of the dynamical tunnelling experiments will be presented in this paper utilizing numerical solutions of the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "furthermore we will analyze the system parameter space which is spanned by the scaled well depth @xmath44 the modulation parameter @xmath5 and the scaled planck s constant @xmath45 . in fact",
    "variation of the scaled planck s constant in the simulations allows one to move the quantum system towards the classical limit .",
    "the quantum dynamics of a periodically driven hamiltonian system can be described in terms of the eigenstates of the floquet operator @xmath46 , which evolves the system in time by one modulation period . in the semiclassical regime , the floquet eigenstates can be associated with regions of regular and irregular motion of the classical map .",
    "however when @xmath47 is not sufficiently small compared to a typical classical action the phase - space representation of the floquet eigenstates do not necessarily match with some classical ( regular or irregular ) structures@xcite .",
    "however , initial states localized at the stable region around a fixed point in the poincar section can be associated with superpositions of a small number of floquet eigenstates . using this state basis",
    ", one can reveal the analogy of the dynamical tunnelling experiments and conventional tunnelling in a double well system .",
    "two states of opposite parity which can be responsible for the observed dynamical tunnelling phenomenon are identified .",
    "floquet states are stroboscopic eigenstates of the system .",
    "their phase space representation therefore provides a quantum analogue to the classical stroboscopic phase space representation , the poincar map .",
    "only very few states are needed to describe the evolution of a wave packet that is initially strongly localized on a region of regular motion .",
    "a strongly localized wavepacket is used in the experiments ( strongly localized in each well of the standing wave ) making the floquet basis very useful .",
    "in contrast , describing the dynamics in momentum or position representation requires a large number of states so that some of the intuitive understanding which one can obtain in the floquet basis is impossible to gain .",
    "for example , the tunnelling period can be derived from the quasi - eigenenergies of the relevant floquet states , as will be shown below .    for an appropriate choice of parameters the phase space exhibits two period-1 fixed points , which for a suitable poincar section lie on the momentum axis at @xmath48 , as in reference @xcite . for certain values of the scaled well depth @xmath49 and @xmath50modulation parameter @xmath5",
    "there are two dominant floquet states @xmath51 that are localized on both fixed points but are distinguished by being even or odd eigenstates of the parity operator that changes the sign of momentum .",
    "a state localized on just one fixed point is therefore likely to have dominant support on an even or odd superposition of these two floquet states : @xmath52 @xmath53 are the floquet quasienergies .",
    "thus at a time which is @xmath54 times the period of modulation , the state initially localized on @xmath55 , evolves to @xmath56 ignoring an overall phase and defining the separation between floquet quasienergies as @xmath57 one obtains @xmath58 at @xmath59 periods , the state will form the anti - symmetric superposition of floquet states and thus is localized on the other fixed point at @xmath60 . in other words",
    "the atoms have tunnelled from one of the fixed points to the other .",
    "this is reminiscent of barrier tunnelling between two wells , where a particle in one well , in a superposition of symmetric and antisymmetric energy eigenstates , oscillates between wells with a frequency given by the energy difference between the eigenstates .",
    "tunnelling can also occur when the initial state has significant overlap with two non - symmetric states .",
    "for example , if the initial state is localized on two floquet states , one localized inside the classical chaotic region and one inside the region of regular motion , a distinct oscillation in the stroboscopic evolution of the mean momentum may be visible .",
    "the frequency of this tunnelling oscillation depends on the spacing of the corresponding quasi - eigenenergies in the floquet spectrum . in many cases",
    "multiple tunnelling frequencies occur in the stroboscopic evolution of the mean momentum some of which are due to tunnelling between non - symmetric states .",
    "quantum dynamical tunnelling may be defined in that a particle can access a region of phase space in a way that is forbidden by the classical dynamics .",
    "this implies that it crosses a kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) surface @xcite .",
    "the clearest evidence of dynamical tunnelling can be obtained by choosing the scaled planck s constant @xmath45 sufficiently small so that the atomic wavefunction is much smaller than the region of regular motion ( the size of the wave function is given by @xmath45 ) .",
    "furthermore it should be centered inside the region of regular motion . however",
    ", even if the wave packet is larger than the region of regular motion and also populates the classical chaotic region of phase space one can still analyze quantum - classical correspondence and tunnelling .",
    "one assumes a classical probability distribution of point particles with the same size as the quantum wave function and compares the classical evolution of this point particle probability distribution with the quantum evolution of the wave packet . a distinct difference between the two evolutions results from the occurrence of tunnelling assuming that the quantum evolution penetrates a kam surface visibly .      using the gross - pitaevskii equation",
    "one can exactly simulate the experiment because the momentum or position representation is used .",
    "therefore the theoretical simulation can be directly compared with the experimental result .",
    "in contrast floquet states do not have a straightforward experimental intuitive analogue . in the floquet states analysis",
    "one can compare the quasienergy splitting between the tunnelling floquet state with the experimentally measured tunnelling period .",
    "the occurrence of multiple frequencies in the experimentally observed tunnelling oscillations might also be explained with the presence of more than two dominant floquet states , the tunnelling frequencies being the energy splitting between different participating floquet states .",
    "using the gross - pitaevskii approach one can simulate the experiment with high precision .",
    "the same number of populated wells as in the experiment can be used and the turn - on of the standing wave can be simulated using an appropriate turn - on hamiltonian .",
    "therefore one can obtain the correct initial state with high precision .",
    "furthermore the mean - field interaction is simulated which is not contained in the floquet approach .",
    "in this section experimental results that were discussed in a previous paper @xcite are compared with numerical simulations of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation .    in the experiment @xcite the atomic wave function",

    "there is good agreement between experiment and theory as far as the tunnelling period is concerned .",
    "however , the experimentally measured tunnelling amplitude is smaller than the theoretical prediction .    it should be noted that the theoretical simulations do not take account of any possible spatial and temporal variations of the scaled well depth ( eg .",
    "light intensity ) , which could possibly lead to the observed discrepancy .",
    "it was decided to produce simulations without using any free parameters .",
    "however the uncertainty associated with the experiment would allow small variations of the modulation parameter @xmath5 and the scaled well depth @xmath67 there was a 10% uncertainty in the value of the scaled well depth @xmath49 and a 5% uncertainty in the modulation parameter @xmath5 ( all reported uncertainties are 1 s.d .",

    "although the theoretical simulation presented does not show any decay in the mean momentum curve , a slight change of parameters inside the experimental uncertainty can lead to decay which is most likely caused by another dominant floquet state whose presence leads to the occurrence of a beating of the tunnelling oscillations which appears as decay ( and revival on longer time scales ) .",
    "a detailed analysis of the corresponding floquet states and their meaning will be presented in sec .",
    "[ floquetanal ] .",
    "an example of how a change of parameters inside the experimental uncertainty in the simulations can optimize the agreement between theory and experiment is shown in fig .",
    "[ chap12fig9 ] and fig .",
    "[ chap12fig10 ] .",
    "both figures are described in more detail later in this section .",
    "another reason for the observed discrepancy could be the evolution of non - condensed atoms that is not contained in the gp approach and the interaction of non - condensed atoms with the condensate . with a sufficiently long adiabatic turn - on time of the far detuned standing wave the production of non - condensed atoms should be negligible",
