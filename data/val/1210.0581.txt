    "from cosmological observations we know that the current universe is to a good approximation flat , homogeneous and isotropic on large scales @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in standard big bang cosmology this requires an enormous amount of fine - tuning on the initial conditions .",
    "two mechanisms are provided to be possible explanations .",
    "the first is inflation @xcite , a period of accelerated expansion occuring between the big bang and nucleosynthesis .",
    "the second is ekpyrosis @xcite , a period of ultra - slow contraction before big bang / big crunch to an expanding phase .",
    "both mechanisms not only manage to address the standard cosmological puzzles but also have the ability to imprint scale invariant inhomogeneities on superhorizon scales via a causal mechanism @xcite . these inhomogeneities are thought to provide the seeds which later become the temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background and the large scale structure in the universe .",
    "this framework of the cosmological perturbation theory is based on the quantum mechanics of scalar fields , where the relevant observable is the amplitude of the field s fourier modes @xcite . although treated as a quantum mechanical variable",
    ", this amplitude is expected to be stochastic variables , characterized by averages of their products , i.e. , power spectrum .",
    "this interpretation proves to be very accurate in the cmb and large scale structure analyses .",
    "however , in order to make this stochastic interpretation consistent , the density matrix has to be diagonal in the amplitude basis .",
    "this criterion implies that interference terms in the density matrix are highly suppressed and can be neglected @xcite .",
    "interference is associated with the coherence of the system , i.e. , the coherence in the state between different points of configuration space @xcite .",
    "a measure of this is the coherence length which gives the configuration distance over which off - diagonal terms are correlated @xcite .",
    "an isolated system described by the schrdinger equation can not lose its coherence ; a pure state always remains pure .",
    "however , if it is coarse grained , it may evolve from a pure to a mixed state .",
    "one way to realize coarse graining is to let the system interact with an environment @xcite .",
    "the environment consists of all fields whose evolution we are not interested in .",
    "the state of the system is obtained by tracing over all possible states of the environment .",
    "now , even if the state describing system plus environment is pure , the state of the system alone will in general be mixed .    in the literature",
    ", there are various arguments and calculations suggesting that a form of such environment decoherence can indeed occur for inflationary perturbations @xcite .",
    "the coherence length decreases exponentially for wavelengths greater than hubble radius .",
    "thus perturbations become classical once their wavelength exceeds the hubble radius .",
    "all of these results lend support to the usual heuristic derivation of the spectrum of density perturbations in inflationary models . in this paper",
    ", we use a simple model to study whether decoherence can also occur in the ekyprotic phase .",
    "we find that the coherence lengths continue increasing even for the modes outside the horizon .",
    "therefore , the heuristic argument that the modes become classical when they leave the horizon is invalid in the ekyprotic phase and requires more careful inspection .",
    "a crucial question is how to model the environment .",
    "any realistic model will be very complicated and hard to analyze .",
    "however , the basic physics should emerge from the simplest models .",
    "hence , we choose a model @xcite which can be solved exactly : the system is a real massless scalar field @xmath0 , and the environment is taken to be a second massless real scalar field @xmath1 interacting with @xmath0 through their gradients .    the action of system and environment is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the determinant of the background metric which is given by @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the coupling constant describing the interaction between two fields .",
    "note that this lagrangian is quadratic in the derivative of the fields and can hence be diagonalized for which the interaction term disappears and the whole lagrangian becomes a free field theory .",
    "if there is no other field or interaction in our universe , this argument is true .",
    "however , we suppose there is a hidden interaction such that we can only obeserve the first field @xmath0 but not the environment @xmath1 . in other words , we assume the environment and the observed system do not form the diagonal basis .",
    "this assumption is reasonable since any observed scalar fields ( whose reduced density matrix we want ) will interact with gravitational perturbations ( which is a part of the environment ) .",
    "then , the canonical momenta @xmath6 conjugate to the fields @xmath7 , @xmath8 are @xmath9 where `` @xmath10 '' denotes derivative with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "this allows us to write the hamiltonian @xmath12 as @xmath13}\\right\\}\\ ] ] to study decoherence , it is more convenient to use the functional schrdinger picture@xcite .",
    "the commutation relation @xmath14}=i\\delta_{ij}\\delta^3(\\mathbf x-\\mathbf y)$ ] is equivalent to making the replacement @xmath15 .",
    "the wave functional @xmath16 $ ] obeys the schrdinger equation @xmath17 we make a gaussian ansatz for @xmath18 to be able to find the vacuum or ground state solution : @xmath19=\\mathcal n\\exp{\\left[-\\frac 12\\int d^3x d^3y { \\left(\\phi_1(\\mathbf x)\\phi_1(\\mathbf y)+\\phi_2(\\mathbf x)\\phi_2(\\mathbf y)\\right)}a(\\mathbf x,\\mathbf y , \\eta)+2\\phi_1(\\mathbf",

    "we also calculate the reduced density matrix and the corresponding coherence length by summing over one of the fields in all three cases .",
    "our results are that if no interaction is present , the coherence length approaches a constant value .",
    "adding even a small interation will reduce it to zero in either usual inflation or power law inflation case .",
    "since this decoherence starts at hubble crossing , the quantum fluctuations evaluated at @xmath84 give the classical initial density perturbations which become the seeds of inhomogenities of our universe later on .",
    "however , this argument does not work for ekpyrosis whose coherence length never hits zero .",
    "this means the quantum coherence would not disappear even when the modes leave the horizon .",
    "therefore , the heuristic argument that the quantum fluctuation can become classical for superhorizon modes is not valid for ekpyrotic phase .",
    "the implication of our result is that the power spectrum of cmb fluctuations is not directly related to the ekpyrotic phase .",
    "even though at the end of ekpyrosis the scalar field has a scale - invariant power spectrum , it is hard to say anything about what we observe right now , since that depends on the `` classical '' initial density perturbations .",
    "this puts some doubts on the analyses of the cosmological perturbations in the cyclic / ekpyrotic universe .",
    "we derived our results using a very simple model . in principle , if we would like to claim the decoherence phenomenon can not occur in ekpyrosis , we have to consider all kinds of interactions between systems and environment which is almost impossible to do .",
    "however , we believe the basic physics should emerge from simple models",
    ". we can easily generalize our analyses to a massive scalar field , and the results would nt change too much . we could also consider different kinds of interactions , but we will leave it to the future work .    finally , we model the environment with a scalar field , which is convincing but might be an oversimplified assumption .",
    "the environment can also be taken to consist of the short wavelength modes which are coupled to the long wavelength modes via non - linear couplings @xcite .",
    "hence , this might be another possible way to generate decoherence during ekpyrosis .",
