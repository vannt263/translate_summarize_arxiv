    "the emergence of population iii ( pop iii ) stars represents a milestone in cosmic evolution , marking the end of the cosmic dark ages and initiating a process of continuous growth in complexity in an erstwhile simple universe .",
    "pop iii stars started the process of cosmic reionization @xcite and produced the first chemical elements heavier than lithium @xcite .",
    "therefore , the detection of pop iii stars by the upcoming near - infrared ( nir ) surveys has the potential to add a key piece in the cosmic evolution puzzle @xcite .    despite their relevance",
    ", there has been no detection of pop iii stars so far @xcite .",
    "even a search using strong gravitational lensing is very unlikely to succeed @xcite .",
    "hence , the most promising strategy is to probe their deaths as gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and very luminous supernovae ( sne ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is now known that some pop iii stars with at least 50 @xmath2 might explode , and be seen as the most energetic thermonuclear events in the universe , being visible at redshift @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the observation of such events will provide unprecedented insights about the early stages of star formation and the high - end of primordial initial mass function ( imf ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this would allow us to probe _ in situ _ the dawn of the first galaxies .",
    "given its relevance , several attempts have been made to estimate the observability of primordial sne @xcite .    using an analytical model for star formation @xcite",
    "have estimated that the rate for pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) is @xmath4 pisne deg@xmath5 yr@xmath6 above @xmath7 = 15 , while @xcite have found a pisn rate of @xmath8 at @xmath9 and @xmath10 at @xmath11 . using a press - schecter ( p - s ) formalism ,",
    "@xcite found a pisn rate of @xmath12 at @xmath13 .",
    "also , @xcite found that in a hypothetical 1-year survey , the _ james web space telescope _ ( _ jwst _ ) should detect up to thousands of sne ( mostly core - collapse ) per unit redshift at @xmath14 . using pisn light curves ( lcs ) and spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from @xcite and an analytical prescription for the star formation history ( sfh ) ,",
    "@xcite found a sn rate of @xmath15 per near - infrared camera ( nircam ) field of view ( fov ) integrated across @xmath16 . using the same lcs as @xcite , but accounting for star formation rate ( sfr ) feedback effects on the pisn rate based in cosmological simulations , @xcite have estimate an upper limit of @xmath17 pisne per nircam fov at any given time .",
    "they concluded that scarcity and not brightness is the controlling factor in their detectability .",
    "@xcite implemented a fully radiation - hydrodynamical simulation of pisne , which included realistic treatment of circumstellar envelopes and lyman absorption by neutral hydrogen prior to the era of reionization .",
    "they have shown that the _ wide - field infrared survey telescope _ ( _ wfirst _ ) and the _ jwst _ are capable of detecting these explosions out to @xmath11 and 30 , respectively .",
    "pop iii stars in the range @xmath18 have oxygen cores that exceed @xmath19 and are predicted to die as pisne @xcite .",
    "the high thermal energy in this region creates @xmath20 pairs , leading to a contraction that triggers violent thermonuclear burning of o and si and releases a total of @xmath21ergs . according to our current understanding",
    ", the lcs of the most massive pisn are expected to be very luminous ( @xmath22 ergs / sec ) , long - lasting ( @xmath23 1000 days in the sn rest - frame ) , and might be observed by the upcoming nir surveys by the _ jwst_.    there is evidence of 15 - 50 @xmath2 pop iii stars in the fossil abundance record , the ashes of early sne thought to be imprinted on ancient metal - poor stars @xcite .",
    "evidence for the odd - even nucleosynthetic imprint of pop iii pisne has now been found in high - redshift damped lyman @xmath24 absorbers @xcite , and 18 metal - poor stars in the sloan digital sky survey have been selected for spectroscopic follow - up on the suspicion that they too harbor this pattern @xcite .",
    "the hunt for the first generation of stars was further motivated by the discovery of a pisn candidate in environments even less favorable to the formation of massive progenitors than the early universe @xcite .    the rate of pisn production is directly associated with the pop iii sfr , which largely depends on the ability of a primordial gas to cool and condense .",
    "hydrogen molecules ( @xmath25 ) are the primary coolant in primordial gas clouds , but are also sensitive to the soft ultraviolet background ( uvb ) .",
    "hence , the uvb in the @xmath26-disassociating lyman - werner ( lw ) bands easily suppress the star formation inside minihaloes .",
    "self - consistent cosmological simulations are required to properly account for these effects . moreover , the spectral signatures of pisne depend on the stellar and environmental properties , such as radius , internal structure , envelope opacity and metallicity , and full hydro and radiative simulations are necessary to include all these features . finally a complete picture of the observing processes , including the physical characteristics of the source and detailed observation conditions , has to be implemented into an unified framework .",
    "the ultimate goal is to generate synthetic photometric data that can be analyzed in the same way as real data would be .    in an effort to improve the current state of pisn observability forecasts ,",
    "this project combines state - of - the - art cosmological and radiative simulations and detailed modeling of the observational process .",
    "the main steps can be summarized as follows .",
    "( i ) we generate sn events using monte carlo simulations whose probability distribution functions are determined by the pisn rate derived from cosmological simulations .",
    "( ii ) the source frame lc for each event is translated to the observer frame by accounting for intergalactic medium ( igm ) absorption , @xmath27-correction and milky way dust extinction .",
    "( iii ) the observer frame lc is convolved with telescope specifications . on the top of all this ,",
    "we simulate an observational strategy specially designed to find high - redshift sne . at the same time",
    ", the strategy must fit within the planned telescope mission using a reasonable amount of time .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : cosmo_sim ] , we discuss the cosmological simulations and how to derive the pisn rate from them .",
    "we discuss the simulations for the pisn lcs and for igm absorption in sections [ sec : sed ] and [ sec : igm ] , respectively .",
    "the survey implementation and observational strategy simulation are described in sections [ sec : survey ] and [ sec : obs_str ] , respectively . finally , in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we present our conclusions .",
    "we use results from a cosmological @xmath28-body / hydrodynamical simulation based on the the first billion years project @xcite .",
    "the simulation uses a modified version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget @xcite , implemented for the overwhelmingly large simulations ( owls ) project @xcite .",
    "the modifications to gadget include line cooling in photoionization equilibrium for 11 elements ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , fe ) @xcite , prescriptions for sne mechanical feedback and metal enrichment , a full non - equilibrium primordial chemistry network and molecular cooling functions for both @xmath26 and hd @xcite .",
    "the prescriptions for pop iii stellar evolution and chemical feedback track the enrichment of the gas in each of the 11 elements listed above individually @xcite , following the nucleosynthetic metal - free stellar yields @xcite .",
    "we take into account an @xmath29-dissociating lw background , both from proximate sources and from sources outside of our simulation volume",
    ". the simulation uses cosmological ( periodic ) initial conditions within a cubic volume 4 mpc ( comoving ) on a side .",
    "it includes both dark matter ( dm ) and gas , with an sph particle mass of @xmath30 and a dm particle mass of @xmath31 .",
    "the simulation is initiated with an equal number of @xmath32 sph and dm particles , adopting cosmological parameters reported by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ ( wmap ) team @xcite .",
    "star formation inside first generation molecular - cooled galaxies is regulated by two dissociation channels : @xmath33 we include photons from cosmological background lw radiation field as well as from local sources .",
    "this affects the photodestruction rate and is included in the primordial chemical network on - the - fly during the simulation .",
    "we briefly describe these processes , as follows .",
    "* radiation background + the lw flux is computed from the comoving density in stars via a conversion efficiency @xmath34 @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the speed of light , _ h _ is planck constant , @xmath34 is the number of photons emitted in the lw bands per stellar baryon , @xmath37 is the mass of hydrogen and @xmath38 is the mass density in stars .",
    "multiple stellar populations are included in equation ( [ eq : jlw ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath34 is given by the values adopted by @xcite for pop iii stars . for pop ii stars , @xmath39 , which is consistent with @xcite and @xcite . *",
    "local sources + in addition to the lw background , strong spatial and temporal variations in the lw flux can be produced locally by individual stellar sources @xcite .",
    "this effect is included by summing the local lw flux contribution from all star particles .",
    "self - shielding was implemented following the approach suggested by @xcite .      during the simulation ,",
    "the transition from the pop iii to the popii / i regime occurs when the gas metallicity , @xmath40 , surpasses the critical value @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the pop iii imf is assumed to have a salpeter slope @xcite with upper and lower limits given by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath26 photodissociation and the photodetachment of its intermediary @xmath44 significantly decreases the cooling efficiency of the primordial gas , thus reducing the pop iii sfr ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfriii ] , top panel ) and slowing the process of chemical enrichment .",
    "because of the short lifetime of these massive stars , it is usually assumed that their sn rate is proportional to the sfr without any significant time delay .",
    "thus , the pisn rate , @xmath45 , can be estimated by @xmath46 where @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfriii ] , we show the intrinsic rates of pisne ( without account for observational issues ) as seen on the sky .",
    "we have arrived at this rate following the approach of @xcite assuming the above pisn rate .",
    "lw feedback increases the intrinsic rate of pisn events at @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "recent results from @xcite have implied that fewer massive pop iii stars may produce pisn if they rotate fast , thereby increasing the pisn rate adopted here by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "( while we have not included this factor in the main simulation , we do take into account possible sources of uncertainty in appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "the pisn sed simulations account for the interaction of the blast with realistic circumstellar envelopes , the envelope opacity , and lyman @xmath24 absorption by the neutral igm at high redshift .",
    "we consider a set of models spanning masses and metallicities of pop iii stars expected to die as pisne @xcite .",
    "the mass range comprises 150 , 175 , 200 , 225 , and 250 @xmath2 for zero - metallicity stars ( z - series ) and @xmath50 stars ( u - series ) from the zero age main sequence ( table [ tab : whalen_model ] ) .",
    "all u - series stars die as red hypergiants and all z - series stars die as compact blue giants .",
    "nevertheless , most 140 - 260 @xmath2 pop iii stars have convective mixing and die as red stars instead of blue stars .",
    "the progenitor structure was evolved from the zero - age main sequence to the onset of collapse in the one - dimensional lagrangian stellar evolution kepler code @xcite and the sn energy is determined by the amount of burned o and si .",
    "the blast was followed until the end of all nuclear burning , when the shock was still deep inside the star .",
    "the energy generation is estimated with a 19-isotope network up to the point of oxygen depletion in the core and with a 128-isotope quasi - equilibrium network thereafter .",
    "the explosions were mapped in the los alamos _ radiation adaptive grid eulerian _ ( rage ) code @xcite in order to propagate the blast through the interstellar medium .",
    "the extracted gas densities , velocities , temperatures and species mass fractions from rage are then interpolated on to a two - dimensional grid in the spectrum code @xcite , which calculates the sn sed .",

    "sn searches usually require multiple visits to the same area of the sky . the intervals between visits",

    "the total area of the sky to be covered , or how many different fields will be monitored by our search has to be chosen in agreement with the telescope scanning law .",
    "because we expect to observe pisne at high redshift ( @xmath57 ) , these objects will remain in the sky for a long time compared with the low - redshift sn counterpart . despite their faintness ,",
    "the redshift stretch allows us to draw the lc , making only a few observations per year of the same field .",
    "the two observational strategies presented here are fully contained within the _ jwst _ flight plan ( table [ tab : strategy ] ) .",
    "we have also taken into account the fact that _ jwst _ will be able to make simultaneous observations with two filters ( one at lower and another at higher wavelengths ) .",
    "strategy 1 consists of one pointing per year for each of the six reddest filters in nircam ( f115w - f444w ) .",
    "this aims at maximizing our ability to identify these sources as high - redshift objects using non - detection in the bluest filters .",
    "strategy 2 involves three pointings per year separated by two - month gaps for filters f150w and f444w .",
    "its main goal is to define a lc shape for each event , allowing us to better distinguish it from other sn types . in both strategies ,",
    "we use @xmath58 sec exposure time for each pointing , during the total 5-yr telescope mission , corresponding to @xmath59 730h per year of telescope time and a total sky coverage of 0.06 per cent . as a matter of comparison ,",
    "the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos ) obtained a total of @xmath59 1030 h of hubble space telescope time @xcite . combining the information from different filters ,",

    "photometrically , the detection a pisn among plenty of sn types , without redshift information , represents a challenge itself ( fig .",
    "[ fig : types ] ) . given the complexity of photometric classification methods ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we postpone this for future work .    assembling all ingredients described so far",
    ", we were able to generate a catalogue of pisn lcs .",
    "the final step is to define a minimum requirement for a sn to be detected .",
    "based on our goal of identifying these objects as transients , it is crucial to obtain at least a few observations near the lc peak .",
    "therefore , for an object to be considered detected , we demanded at least one epoch before and one epoch after maximum brightness .",
    "we also required the detection of three epochs in at least one filter above background limit . here",
    "we present results for a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) selection cut of s / n@xmath602 in at least one filter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "more restrictive cuts might become infeasible in terms of the _ jwst _ allocation time .",
    "nevertheless , we should point out that the framework described so far is flexible enough to accommodate any observational strategy , sfr , sn sed , and other missions as well .    using the complete framework",
    ", we obtained @xmath61 pisn detections from strategy 1 and @xmath624 pisn from strategy 2 ( averaged over 100 realizations ) , both satisfying s / n@xmath602 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) .",
    "this is a clear indication that the _ jwst _ will be able to observe a handful of pisn , but not without using a significant amount of telescope time . in the two strategies ,",
    "a minimum of one month per year of allocation time is necessary to obtain @xmath59 1 - 2 detections per year .",
    "it should be noted that these predictions are obtained under very conservative assumptions .",
    "accounting for uncertainties in pop iii sfr and imf could increase our results up to @xmath63 detections ( or even more ) for strategies 1 and 2 respectively ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hist2 ] ) .",
    "we show that , given a fixed amount of telescope time , changing the observation strategy might increase the number of detections .",
    "this suggests that strategy 2 , consisting of three pointings per year with only two filters , results in more detections than strategy 1 .",
    "once potential candidates are detected , the brightest sources will be suitable for more detailed follow - ups , thereby placing strong limits on their metal content . for low - metallicity objects , the ratios of oxygen lines to balmer lines , such as [",

    "we have not discussed the minimum requirements ( s / n , number of detections , number of filters , etc . ) needed to photometrically classify these objects for posterior spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "because of to time dilation , the sne lcs last in the sky for a couple of years , requiring an extended survey to detect these objects as transients . the most promising way should be to find these events with an ir mission with a larger fov such as _ euclid _ , and after identifying the interesting candidates , perform a more careful analysis with _",
