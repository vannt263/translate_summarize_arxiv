    "turbulent eddies convecting within the boundary layer of an aerofoil are scattered into sound at the trailing edge .",
    "this , turbulent boundary layer trailing edge noise , is a major source of broadband noise for an aerofoil in a uniform flow .",
    "it is the dominant noise source for large wind turbines  @xcite . for installed fans ,",
    "trailing edge noise corresponds to the minimum achievable noise level  @xcite .",
    "although this paper focuses on trailing edge noise , rotors and propellers are subject to several other noise sources  @xcite . some of these are broadband , for example leading edge noise @xcite due to upstream turbulence , tip vortex induced noise and stall noise  @xcite .",
    "others are tonal , as in the case of : steady loading in the reference frame of the rotor ( @xcite ,  @xcite ) ; periodic unsteady loading produced by stationary distortions in the flow .    trailing edge noise",
    "can be predicted in the time domain by solving the ffowcs - williams & hawkings ( fwh ) equation ( @xcite ) , as demonstrated by  @xcite .",
    "however , this type of prediction requires numerical differentiations and the calculation of retarded times that are computationally expensive .",
    "most importantly , the roles of blade geometry and operating conditions become clearer with the frequency domain formulations that are the subject of this paper .",
    "another key advantage of the frequency domain formulation is that it is more suited for a statistical description of the noise sources .",
    "one of the most successful frequency domain formulations was developed by amiet ( @xcite ) .",
    "assuming knowledge of the pressure fluctuations travelling towards the trailing edge , amiet s formulation gives an analytical expression for the power spectral density in the far field .",
    "this analytical expression makes it efficient and attractive for fast turn - around applications .",
    "it has been applied to numerous applications including low speed fans  ( @xcite ) , helicopters  ( @xcite ) and wind turbines  ( @xcite ) .",
    "although amiet s approach was initially restricted to high frequencies relative to the chord ( @xmath0 ) , it has been extended to lower frequencies ( @xmath1 ) by  @xcite .",
    "the effect of rotation on trailing edge noise modelling was analysed in @xcite and @xcite for a rotor in a uniform flow .",
    "the first step is to estimate the instantaneous power spectral density radiating from the blade , while it is located at a particular azimuthal angle around the hub .",
    "secondly , the power spectra are averaged in time .",
    "the final expression involves a doppler factor of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the source frequency and @xmath4 the frequency of the observed sound .",
    "the exponent @xmath5 takes the value 1 in @xcite , 2 in @xcite and -2 in @xcite .",
    "it is clear that an independent formulation is needed to explain these discrepancies and identify the correct form of schlinker and amiet s theory .",
    "this paper presents a new formulation of trailing edge noise for small rotating blade elements  ( section  [ cha : kim - george - approach ] ) .",
    "it is analogous to the formulations developed by  @xcite for ducted fans , although cascade effects are not taken into account .",
    "the derivation starts with goldstein s  ( @xcite ) expression for loading noise and uses the green s function of @xcite , which incorporates the effect of mean flow , to derive an expression for pressure in the frequency domain .",
    "this expression is then used to derive the instantaneous psd and the time averaged psd .",
    "the new formulations generalize the compact source solution of  @xcite , who used the expression of  @xcite for a rotating point load .",
    "they incorporate an accurate description of the blade rotation , hence of the effect of blade acceleration ; this effect is not taken into account in schlinker and amiet s formulation where the blade is assumed to be in uniform rectilinear motion .",
    "the time averaged formulation can therefore serve to explore the validity of schlinker and amiet s approach .",
    "the derivation of the new formulation was inspired by  @xcite who first compared schlinker and amiet s model with a solution of the fwh equation .",
    "their formulation of schlinker and amiet s model differed significantly from that of  @xcite but was not accompanied by an alternative derivation .",
    "also , they neglected the effect of mean flow and spanwise wavenumber .",
    "both effects are taken into account in our new formulation .",
    "we revisit schlinker and amiet s theory and present simple derivations for some key steps that help to obtain the correct result ( section [ sec : amiets - appr - rotat ] ) .",
    "of particular interest is the derivation showing how a theory derived for a stationary aerofoil can be generalized to an aerofoil in uniform motion .",

    "this allows us to relate the propagation time @xmath217 to @xmath20 and @xmath225 since @xmath227 where we have used the fact that @xmath228 is independent of the reference frame ( see figure  [ fig : reference_frames ] ) .    in general the convected source position @xmath225",
    "is obtained by seeding the flow with a small particle that is released from the source position at emission time and convects at the mach number of the ambient fluid ; @xmath225 corresponds to the position of the particle at reception time . using the reference frame of the observer ( figure  [ fig : reference_frames](a ) ) , we get @xmath229    substituting   into   and taking the square of the result , @xmath230 the above equation leads to a second order polynomial equation in @xmath231 whose solution is given by @xmath232 where @xmath233 denotes the angle between @xmath209 and @xmath20 .      in the reference frame of the blade used in section  [ sec : trailing - edge - noise ] , the @xmath234-axis is pointing spanwise and the @xmath235-axis is pointing chordwise .",

    "a derivation of @xmath167 , extending that of  @xcite to the case of a non - zero angle of attack , is given in appendix  [ sec : chordw - mach - numb ] .",
    "the time averaged psd is obtained by averaging the instantaneous psd , i.e. equation  , over one rotation of the rotor . since the instantaneous psd is a function of source time @xmath22 , the time increment @xmath256 must be expressed in terms of @xmath257 . if @xmath147 is the number of acoustic periods measured at the observer location during @xmath256 then @xmath258 .",
    "the time taken for the source to generate those @xmath147 periods is @xmath259 so @xmath260 .",
    "finally , it is convenient to express @xmath257 in terms of the blade azimuthal angle @xmath261 using the relation @xmath262 .",

    "for example , @xcite initially proposed a value of 1 for the exponent . the same is considered by @xcite .",

    "one divides the blade into small elements along its radius and sums the ( uncorrelated ) noise spectra generated from each element .",
    "limitations and extensions of strip theory are discussed in  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the approximations discussed in section  [ sec : trailing - edge - noise]([sec : discussion ] ) , the thin - blade approximation has been used .",
