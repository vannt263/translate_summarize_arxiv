    "the coulomb glass , a prominent model of disordered systems of localised particles with long - range interaction , has been extensively studied for almost three decades .",
    "it plays an important role as a semi - classical model for dilute impurity bands when quantum interference as well as thermal excitation to the conduction band or from the valence band can be neglected .",
    "various aspects of this model have been investigated since the pioneering works by pollak ( 1970 ) , srinivasan ( 1970 ) , efros and shklovskii ( 1975 ) , and kurosawa and sugimoto ( 1975 ) ; for related reviews see shklovskii and efros ( 1984 ) , efros and shklovskii ( 1985 ) , pollak and ortuo ( 1985 ) , and ortuo _",
    "et al_.  ( 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , this area of research has not lost its attraction , as is shown , for example , by recent studies of aging effects in electric conduction ( vaknin _ et al_.  2000 ) , of the possibility of a phase transition ( grannan and yu 1993 , vojta and schreiber 1994 , daz - snchez _ et al_.  2000b ) , and by combined investigations of dc conductivity and tunnel conductance ( sandow _ et al_.  2001 ) .",
    "an important and characteristic feature of the coulomb glass is the many - valley structure of its configuration space , not only concerning single - particle hops , but also with respect to some classes of more complex excitations . in this respect",
    "it resembles the ising spin glass and other disordered systems , see e.g.  mzard _",
    "et al_.(1987 ) . this configuration - space structure",
    "is related to the existence of a huge number of so - called pseudo - ground states , as was observed in the first numerical coulomb glass simulations ( baranovskii _ et al_.  1976 ) .",
    "the spectrum of these pseudo - ground states has recently been investigated in detail by kogan ( 1998 ) . moreover , the related importance of many - particle excitations is directly illustrated by fig .  3 in schreiber and tenelsen ( 1993 ) .",
    "in particular , the huge number of local minima has been shown to cause a glass like relaxation behaviour ( schreiber _ et al_.  1996 , prez - garrido _",
    "et al_.  1999 ) and non - ergodic effects ( daz - snchez _",
    "et al_.  2000a ) .",
    "however , under certain conditions , also `` equilibrium '' observables can reflect the many - valley character of the configuration space .",
    "we focus here on the specific heat @xmath0 ( heat capacity per site ) , in particular on its temperature dependence @xmath1 for various dimensions @xmath2 .",
    "it has been studied numerically by several groups ( baranovskii _ et al_.  1982 , davies _",
    "et al_.  1982 , davies _ et al_.   1984 , schreiber and tenelsen 1993 , tenelsen and schreiber 1994 , mbius and pollak 1996 , mbius and thomas 1997 ) , mainly by means of the metropolis procedure ( metropolis _ et al_.  1953 ) .",
    "however , this approach is inappropriate in the low - temperature region .",
    "one of the reasons for its failure is a direct consequence of the many - valley structure of the configuration space : the simulations usually get stuck in some local minimum .",
    "consequently , other methods have to be used .",
    "thus , almost complete sets of system states were obtained for the direct calculation of the low-@xmath3 behaviour of @xmath1 by means of different algorithms in schreiber and tenelsen ( 1993 ) , tenelsen and schreiber ( 1994 ) , mbius and pollak ( 1996 ) , mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) , compare also mochena and pollak ( 1991 ) and prez - garrido _",
    "et al_.  ( 1997 ) .",
    "unfortunately , these specific heat studies have so far been restricted to the three - dimensional lattice model .    to obtain an analytical description of @xmath1 , baranovskii _ et al . _  ( 1980 ) considered the excitation from the ground state by independent single - particle hops . in the case of randomly positioned sites ,",
    "the adequacy of this approach was supported by numerical experiments ( baranovskii _ et al . _  1982 ) . however , for the three - dimensional lattice case , mbius and pollak ( 1996 ) showed ( though only for one value of the disorder strength ) that this description considerably underestimates @xmath1 .",
    "the aim of our present work is to study the temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath1 in the general case , considering in particular also that @xmath3 region which is not accessible to usual metropolis simulations .",
    "we have simulated one- to three - dimensional samples with both random and lattice structures , and , in the latter case , we have varied the strength of the disorder . to illuminate the puzzling situation described in the previous paragraph , we have sought for the conditions under which @xmath1 can be understood in terms of independent single - particle hops . for that purposes , the computer code which was developed in mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) for",
    "the three - dimensional lattice case has been rewritten and improved to handle arbitrary structures .",
    "all situations which are to be studied can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where the first sum represents an on - site disorder contribution and the second sum describes the coulomb interaction , see e.g.   shklovskii and efros ( 1984 ) .",
    "the sums are over the @xmath5 sites of the sample . these sites positioned at @xmath6 are arranged either on a lattice ( lattice model ) , or randomly ( random - position model ) , the more realistic case .",
    "the occupation number @xmath7 indicates whether or not site @xmath8 is occupied by one of the mobile charges  note that , in a donor band , @xmath9 corresponds to a missing electron . in the lattice model ,",
    "the @xmath10 describe only the on - site disorder potential ; they are uniformly distributed between @xmath11 and @xmath12 where the parameter @xmath13 characterises the strength of the disorder . in this case , for electroneutrality , background charges @xmath14 are attached to each site where @xmath15 . however , for an n - type impurity band emulated by means of the random - position model , the @xmath10 denote the potentials of the charged acceptors and we have @xmath16 .",
    "elementary charge , spatial density of the @xmath6 , and dielectric constant are all taken to be 1 .    in order to reduce finite - size effects and to exclude the influence of surfaces , we have modified the interaction term in our simulations by imposing periodic boundary conditions and using the minimum image convention ( metropolis _ et al_.  1953 , davies _",
    "et al_.  1982 ) .",
    "thus our sample is an elementary cell in a ( super)lattice , and the interaction energy of two sites is assumed to be determined by the shortest distance within this repeated representation .",
    "moreover , we take into account particle exchange with a reservoir .",
    "that means we consider the grand canonical potential @xmath17 , where the chemical potential @xmath18 , if it is not already fixed by symmetry reasons , is determined by relaxing the closed system before starting the metropolis part of the simulation .",
    "considering the grand canonical ensemble rather than the canonical has several advantages .",
    "correlation times are reduced by emulating in this manner also long - range hops . moreover ,",
    "in particular at high @xmath3 , the influence of finite - size effects is diminished .",
    "however , one must remember that any @xmath3-dependence of @xmath18 may influence @xmath1 , as it does in metals .",
    "we have taken care to exclude such effects in the tests of our code .",
    "in order to treat correlations completely , we have studied the specific heat of the coulomb glass by numerical simulations .",
    "the standard procedure for this is the metropolis algorithm ( metropolis _ et al_.  1953 ) which consists of substituting time averaging for ensemble averaging . for related surveys",
    "see e.g.  binder ( 1984 ) or binder ( 1997 ) , and references therein .",
    "however , in this approach , at low @xmath3 and close to phase transitions , large difficulties arise from diverging correlation times . in the low-@xmath3 case ,",
    "these difficulties are reduced to a large extent by the hybrid algorithm developed in mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) .",
    "this bridges the gap between metropolis simulation and analytical statistical mechanics . in the present work ,",
    "we use an improved version of this procedure .",
    "the difficulties mentioned above are tackled here in two ways following mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) .",
    "first , in order to handle the problem of the great portion of unsuccessful attempts at low @xmath3 , we do not perform random trials of state modifications at discrete time values as in the original metropolis approach .",
    "rather , on a continuous time scale , we focus on the state modifications which are really performed , though each such state investigation is clearly more elaborate than the trials in the standard procedure : to obtain the mean dwell time at the current state , the transition probabilities to all of its neighbours in the configuration space are calculated ; the next state ( in time ) is picked randomly according to the ratios of the various transition probabilities , see mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) .",
    "this approach resembles the n - fold way algorithm ( bortz _ et al_.  1975 ) .",
    "it becomes increasingly advantageous in comparison to the standard metropolis procedure as @xmath3 is lowered .",
    "moreover , problems which can arise from time discretization ( adam _ et al_.  1999 ) are avoided in this way .",
    "second , our hybrid algorithm takes advantage of the fact that thermodynamic averages are independent of the dynamics considered provided only that detailed balance is guaranteed .",
    "thus , in order to reduce the problems arising from the huge number of local minima , it decomposes the configuration space into low- and high - energy parts , and utilises very fast auxiliary transitions additionally introduced between the states in the low - energy part .",
    "therefore , the sample simulated thermalises very rapidly with respect to the low - energy part of the configuration space as soon as its state enters this region : due to the fast auxiliary transitions , the dwell time in this low - energy part as a whole is large in comparison to the dwell time in one of the states contained in it . thus all quantities can be assumed to have the corresponding thermal averages of the low - energy subset of the configuration space while the sample stays in this configuration space region .",
    "moreover , the escape probability from this subset does not depend on the entrance state .",
    "for details we have to refer to mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) . for related approaches",
    "see frantz _",
    "et al_.  ( 1990 ) and krauth and pluchery ( 1994 ) .    in the present work ,",
    "we have modified these ideas in three ways .",
    "we have used an improved algorithm for obtaining an almost complete set of low - energy system states . in mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) , this subset was constructed by first sampling local minima , and then stepwise improving this subset by adding all the low - energy states found during the simulation , see also schreiber and tenelsen ( 1993 ) . here , we have extended the subset construction as introduced in daz - snchez _",
    "et al_.  ( 2000a ) .",
    "that means , we first sample local minima ; then we improve this backbone of the low - energy subset by thermal cycling ( mbius _ et al_.  1997 ) ( one could also compare this optimisation procedure with compaction of a granular medium , such as ground coffee , by shaking ) . finally , we search systematically the surroundings of all low - energy system states that have been found so far for further states ( mbius and pollak 1996 , prez - garrido _ et al_.  1997 ) . also in our new code , we add the states visited during the metropolis simulation to the low - energy states set if their energy is lower than the highest energy value in this subset .",
    "that this happens very seldom in practice , confirms the efficiency of the three - stage low - energy subset construction procedure , described above .",
    "as has often been stressed by mike pollak , see e.g.  the review pollak and ortuo ( 1985 ) , cluster excitations are expected to play an essential role in the low-@xmath3 dynamics of the coulomb glass . in a direct way",
    ", one can include only small , compact clusters into the metropolis dynamics .",
    "unfortunately , due to the long - range character of the interaction , the usual cluster algorithms as proposed in swendsen and wang ( 1987 ) seem not to be applicable .",
    "therefore , we use another approach here : comparing repeatedly small numbers of states from the low - energy subset ( mainly picked randomly ) , we search for groups of sites which change occupation only simultaneously , see kawashima and suzuki ( 1992 ) . these clusters are tabulated and included into the simulation dynamics .",
    "finally , in order to prevent the low-@xmath3 improvements , described above , from slowing down too much the computer code in the high-@xmath3 case , we have introduced a @xmath3 dependent neighbourhood pruning : the number of the transitions included in the metropolis dynamics is appropriately reduced with increasing temperature .",
    "a series of tests has been performed to check and optimise the new code . the quality of the sets of low - energy states was confirmed for various degrees of disorder by series of runs in which we treated the same sample repeatedly .",
    "moreover , we simulated lattice samples without disorder and reproduced the ordered ground states . in these tests ,",
    "when we considered half - filled three - dimensional samples of @xmath19 sites ( @xmath20 integer ) , we observed the nacl structure to be the ground state only for odd @xmath20 . the six - fold degenerate layered structure has slightly lower energies for arbitrary even @xmath20 . at present",
    ", we can not answer the question whether this strange feature of the long - range coulomb interaction is only an artifact of the boundary conditions , or whether it has some physical meaning .",
    "however , it is remarkable in this context that layered structures have been observed in quench simulations of one - component plasmas ( ogata and ichimaru 1989 ) .",
    "additionally , we have considered lattice samples without disorder where only a fraction @xmath21 of the sites is occupied ( @xmath22 integer ) , studied analytically in hunt and pollak ( 1986 ) . for @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , we obtained ground states with layered structure .",
    "we turn now to the discussion of the @xmath1 data obtained in the simulations .",
    "we have compared our results on the random - position model with those obtained previously by baranovskii _",
    "et al_.   ( 1982 ) : we observed very good agreement except for slightly larger peak values in our case .",
    "( in the present study , the smallest considered @xmath3 value is lower than in baranovskii _ et al_.  ( 1982 ) by a factor 16 . ) furthermore , also the comparison with lattice data from mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) showed perfect agreement within the statistical accuracy .",
    "finite - size effects can considerably complicate coulomb glass simulations due to the long - range character of the interaction .",
    "such problems are well - known from the study of the single - particle density of states where the sample size is related to a cut - off energy of the interaction spectrum and thus to a reliability limit in the energy dependence of this density of states ( baranovskii _ et al_.  1979 , mbius _",
    "et al_.  1992 ) . in consequence ,",
    "the thermal smearing of the coulomb gap is connected with a correlation length diverging as @xmath26 ( hunt 1990 ) . however , those correlations and corresponding processes which are essential for the formation of the coulomb gap need not also be the most important for the specific heat .",
    "other state modifications rather than single - particle hops can be far more important for this quantity .",
    "this assertion is suggested by the numerical data from mbius and pollak ( 1996 ) showing that , for @xmath23 , @xmath1 data seem to be reliable down to @xmath3 values far smaller than the cut - off energy of the interaction spectrum .    to illuminate this point ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath1 for various sample sizes in fig .  1",
    ", considering the lattice model with fixed disorder strength with @xmath27 , 2 , and 3 . for @xmath27 ,",
    "the curves for @xmath28 , and 400 sites agree perfectly ( within the statistical accuracy of our data ) above as well as below the cut - off of the interaction energies , @xmath29 , of the smaller sample . on the other hand ,",
    "considerable finite - size effects are present for @xmath30 over the range @xmath31 .",
    "thus the specific heat is mainly determined by short - range single- or multi - particle hops here .",
    "there are large @xmath1 fluctuations in the smaller samples at the lowest @xmath3 values ( tenelsen and schreiber 1994 , mbius and pollak 1996 ) .",
    "these fluctuations seem to be `` localised '' in the big samples .    in the case",
    "@xmath32 , significant finite - size effects are present for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "however , the deviation between the data for samples of 100 and 900 sites is very small , just at the accuracy limit . for @xmath23 ,",
    "finite - size effects are clearly larger than in the previous cases .",
    "however , the results for samples of 512 and 1000 sites agree well with each other .      fig .",
    "1 shows that the finite - size effects , which arise from the coulomb interaction , rise with increasing @xmath2 . to illuminate the interplay of interaction and dimension directly , fig .",
    "2 compares @xmath1 data for various @xmath2 from lattice simulations with fixed disorder strength with the interaction - free case . in the latter situation ,",
    "analytical calculations yield that @xmath36 for @xmath26 and that @xmath37 if @xmath38 , in agreement with the numerical data .",
    "switching on the coulomb interaction causes @xmath0 to decrease at low @xmath3 and to increase at high @xmath3 , the more the larger @xmath2 is . in the low-@xmath3 region",
    ", @xmath1 decreases faster than linear as @xmath39 .",
    "though @xmath1 can not be approximated by a simple power law in the low-@xmath3 region studied , our data raises the question of whether @xmath1 might tend to a linear dependence again if @xmath3 is sufficiently lowered .",
    "the influence of disorder strength is studied in figs .  3 and 4 , showing @xmath40 and @xmath0 , respectively , in dependence on @xmath41 .",
    "the observation that , for high @xmath3 , increasing @xmath13 reflects as some shift of @xmath1 towards higher @xmath3 , which was reported for @xmath42 in mbius and thomas ( 1997 ) , is made here also for @xmath32 and @xmath27 .",
    "however , at low @xmath3 , there is a weaker , but more complicated dependence on the disorder strength . in all cases ,",
    "the random - position model yields broader @xmath1 curves than the lattice model . at low @xmath3",
    ", these data are close to the results obtained for low disorder strength in the lattice model .    a particular feature of @xmath1",
    "is only seen clearly when @xmath0 is plotted on a linear scale as in fig .  4 : in the lattice model , for @xmath43 and @xmath32 as well as @xmath23 , the @xmath1 curve is narrower and considerably higher than for the other @xmath13 values .",
    "the question , whether or not this behaviour might be a precursor of a phase transition for still lower @xmath13 ( grannan and yu 1993 , vojta and schreiber 1994 , daz - snchez _",
    "et al_.  2000b ) can not be answered yet .",
    "corresponding simulations are extremely cpu - time consuming .",
    "finally , we address the question of which processes determine @xmath1 as @xmath26 . to clarify which contributions to the specific heat yield single - particle hops ( sph ) and multi - particle hops , respectively ,",
    "we have calculated the value @xmath44 , which one obtains when considering sphs to be the only relevant , independent excitations of the ground state .",
    "the @xmath3-dependence of the quotient of @xmath44 and of the `` exact '' @xmath1 data is represented in fig .   5 for various @xmath2 and @xmath13 , for the lattice as well as for the random - position model .",
    "the sph approximation obviously begins to fail when @xmath3 is sufficiently increased for a significant number of sites to belong simultaneously to more than one of the excited sphs .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "5 focuses on that region , where the corresponding overlap correction does not exceed @xmath45 ; quotient values for higher @xmath3 , included in certain cases only , show that the breakdown of the above condition is correlated with a qualitative change of the quotient s @xmath3 dependence .",
    "the maximum applicability @xmath3 of the sph approximation decreases with increasing sample size .",
    "therefore , for @xmath27 and 2 , medium sample sizes are considered here .",
    "nevertheless , quotient values could only be obtained for a @xmath3 region which can not be studied by standard metropolis simulations , and , for the random - position model in the case @xmath27 , the applicability region of the sph approximation includes only one data point .",
    "5 shows that the sph approximation , when applicable , clearly underestimates @xmath0 for all but one case ; the random - position model for @xmath27 is the only exception . in more detail , in the two- and three - dimensional lattice models , multi - particle contributions are particularly important for weak disorder . in the random - position model ,",
    "the relevance of multi - particle excitations increases with the dimension .    thus , fig .",
    "5 implies the conclusion that , in agreement with mike pollak s view on the coulomb glass model ( pollak and ortuo 1985 ) , multi - particle processes yield an essential contribution to the specific heat in the low - temperature limit .",
    "part of this study was performed during a stay of am at the california state university , bakersfield .",
    "he thanks the us national science foundation for financing this visit under grant dmr-9803686 , and the colleagues in bakersfield for their hospitality .",
    "moreover , we are much obliged to a. hunt for critical discussions , and to u.  kleinekathfer , s.  kstlmeier , and m.  schreiber for the possibility to perform part of the simulations at workstations of the technische universitt chemnitz , and for various related help ."
