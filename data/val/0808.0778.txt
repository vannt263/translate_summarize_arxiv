    "discovery and application of giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) in metallic thin films marks the beginning of a new era of spintronics.@xcite since then , people begin to exploit electron spin to replace the role of electron charge in electronic devices . as a counterpart of charge current ,",
    "spin current , in which spin - up and spin - down electrons move coherently in opposite directions , has been attracted extensive interests.@xcite various methods were proposed to generate spin current,@xcite and to explore the characteristics of the spin transport . over last few years , search of spin current has made a great of progresses .",
    "it has been generated and detected successfully by various means , such as the optical injection,@xcite the magnetic tunnelling injection,@xcite or the spin hall effect.@xcite all these experiments focus on the optical measurement of spin accumulation near the boundaries of sample or electric measurement of the scattering effect induced by the spin current via spin - orbital coupling .",
    "there are also some proposals to measure spin current or spin polarized current,@xcite e.g. to measure the spin torque while a spin current flowing through a ferromagnetic - nonmagnetic interface,@xcite or to detect the induced electric field by the spin current.@xcite in all these methods , it always involves the optical , magnetic materials or impurities , magnetic field , or spin - orbit interaction . up to now , it is still a challenge to detect the spin current efficiently , which has become a bottleneck of the development of the spintronics .",
    "when a spin current flows through a device , there always exists a spin bias between the two terminals of the device.@xcite a spin bias means that the chemical potentials of the two terminals are spin - dependent ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the spin bias is regarded as the driving force behind the spin current .",
    "when the circuit is open , the spin current has to be zero .",
    "consequently the spin bias usually induce spin accumulation in equilibrium .",
    "when the circuit is connected , a spin current circulates . the relation between spin bias and spin current is very similar with the relation between the charge bias and",
    "charge current . on the charge transport",
    ", people often detect the charge bias to replace the measurement of the charge current .",
    "correspondingly we can also measure the spin bias instead of the spin current . in this paper",
    ", we propose an effective method to detect the spin bias .",
    "the present proposal is a whole electric measurement of spin bias by means of a double quantum dot ( dqd )",
    ". it does not involve any optical or magnetic means , and even the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the spin bias can be detected by measuring the ( charge ) bias .",
    "the dqd can be regarded as an artificial molecule , and the electron numbers in dqd can be controlled very well . in last two decades , the electron transport through the dqd device has been extensively investigated.@xcite dqd has also been proposed as a qubit,@xcite a device to detect various tunnelling rates and spin flip rate,@xcite and so on . here",
    "we propose that a dqd can be applied to measure the spin bias or spin current .",
    "let us first describe the working mechanism of dqd as a detector of spin bias .",
    "consider a dqd coupled into two conducting leads .",
    "suppose a spin bias be applied between the left and right leads .",
    "our task is to measure this spin bias _ experimentally_.",
    "the spin bias is defined as the spin - dependent chemical potentials of the two leads with @xmath0 ( see fig.1).@xcite assume that the left - dot level @xmath1 is set at zero and the right - dot level @xmath2 is at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the intra - dot electron - electron ( e - e ) coulomb interaction .",
    "this particular level position is chosen to demonstrate the physics in our proposal , and is not necessary at all in a general case .",
    "the left dot has a spin - up electron because of @xmath5 , while the right dot , because of @xmath6 , is occupied by a spin - down electron , and its spin - up level is consequently pushed away to the higher energy @xmath7 and is empty ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the spin - up electron can then tunnel from the left lead via the two dots to the right lead ( see fig.1a ) .",
    "oppositely the spin - down electron can hardly flow from the right lead to the left lead because of the pauli exclusion principle and the occupancy of the spin - down level in the right dot ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "this breaks the symmetry of the motion of spin - up and spin - down electrons in a pure spin bias . as a result ,",
    "a ( charge ) current circulates .",
    "this induced current can be measured experimentally , and consequently be applied to measure the spin bias .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the model for the dqd and the general formalism for nonequilibrium keldysh green s function method are presented .",
    "the spin - bias - induced charge current @xmath8 and the electron occupation numbers in the dqd are calculated . in section iii ,",
    "we take the numerical investigation .",
    "the spin - dependent charge stability diagram in terms of the spin bias is obtained . in section iv ,",
    "the induced charge bias in an open circuit is numerically studied .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in section v.",
    "in this section , we present the model hamiltonian of this dqd and the general formalism of keldysh green s function technique for electron transport through the dqd .",
    "the dqd device is modelled by the following hamiltonian , @xmath9where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators of electron with spin @xmath14(@xmath15 in the lead @xmath16(@xmath17 and the dot @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "each dot has a single energy level @xmath18 and an intra - dot e - e interaction @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the inter - dot e - e interaction @xmath20 is also included .",
    "we emphasize that the system does not break the spin su(2 ) symmetry , and the hopping coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 are spin - independent .    following the transport theory of keldysh green s function,@xcite the electron current @xmath23 with the spin @xmath14 from the lead @xmath24 flowing into the dot @xmath16 and the occupation number of electron @xmath25 at the level @xmath26 can be expressed as , @xmath27 \\\\",
    "n_{\\alpha \\sigma } & = & \\langle d_{\\alpha \\sigma } ^{\\dagger } d_{\\alpha \\sigma } \\rangle = -i\\int \\frac{d\\epsilon } { 2\\pi } g_{\\alpha \\alpha \\sigma } ^{<}(\\epsilon ) \\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath29 + 1\\}$ ] is the fermi - dirac distribution of electrons in the leads . because of the spin bias in the two leads , the chemical potentials for spin - up and spin - down electrons are not equal .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) are the standard retarded and the keldysh green s functions of the qds , they are the fourier transformation of @xmath32 , where @xmath33    we first solve the green s functions @xmath34 of the isolated dqds system ( i.e. @xmath35 ) . consider that the spin bias @xmath36 is less than the intra - dot e - e interaction @xmath19 and the two - electron co - tunneling events can be ignored .",
    "@xmath37 are obtained from the equation of motion technique : note21 @xmath38and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 for @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 for @xmath45 and @xmath46 for @xmath47 , @xmath48u_{ex}+i0^{+}$ ] , @xmath49 $ ] , and @xmath50 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath52 is the total occupation number of electron in the dot @xmath16 . after solving @xmath37 of the isolated dqds , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the whole system",
    "can be obtained from dyson and keldysh equations:@xcite @xmath55here the bold face letters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ) represent the @xmath59 matrix , and the self - energies @xmath60 are : @xmath61eqs .",
    "( 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 ) can be solved self - consistently .",
    "the ( charge ) current through the dqd is given by @xmath62    finally it is worth pointing out that the present problem can be solved by other means , for example ,  the rate equation method.@xcite",
    "before presenting numerical results , we emphasize that the spin bias we apply to the dqds device is a pure symmetric one without a ( charge ) bias , i.e. @xmath63.@xcite so if the spontaneously spin - polarized occupations are not induced in the dqd , the charge current @xmath8 must be zero because of the symmetric behaviors for the motion of spin - up electron and the spin - down electron .",
    "for example , in the case of a single quantum dot instead of dqds applied by the pure spin bias , there is no spin polarization in the dot and the current is always zero as the spin up - down symmetry is retained .",
    "so , in the following , we first investigate the stability diagram of spin polarization and the spin - dependent charge density in the dqd .",
    "fig.2a and b present the spin polarizations @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) of the left and right dots versus the levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and fig .",
    "2c presents the occupation number of electron @xmath66.note it is found that these quantities are determined by the relative energy levels of @xmath1 and @xmath67 the spin polarization @xmath68 is indeed non - zero and even quite large ( i.e. near @xmath69 ) in some specific regions .",
    "let us analyze the spin - dependent charge stability diagram ( see fig.3a ) , which gives spin - dependent occupation numbers of electron as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if without the spin bias ( @xmath70 ) , there are four domains @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 in the stability diagram ( see the thin dashed curves in fig.3a ) , with @xmath75 representing @xmath76 and @xmath77 electrons in the left and right dot . this type of charge stability diagram has been observed experimentally,@xcite and is well established .",
    "while the spin bias @xmath36 is turned on and the level @xmath1 or @xmath2 locates between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , in addition of the four old spin - unpolarized domains @xmath75 with a shift @xmath36 of their boundaries shift , there appears four new spin - polarized domains , which are denoted by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 .",
    "the notation @xmath84 , for example , represents an electron of spin - up in the left dot and a spin - unpolarized electron in the right dot .    this spin - dependent charge stability diagram in fig.3a",
    "can be obtained by calculating the electrochemical potentials of the dqd or by analyzing the level s position relative to the spin - dependent chemical potentials @xmath85 .",
    "consider the isolated dqds device with @xmath86 .",
    "( i ) the domain ( 0,1 ) : when the equivalent level @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) of the left dot is higher than @xmath89 and @xmath90 and the right - dot s level @xmath2 satisfies @xmath91 ( see fig.3b ) , the right dot is occupied by a spin - unpolarized electron and the left dot is empty .",
    "( ii ) the domain @xmath80 : while @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( see fig.3c ) , a spin - up electron occupies the left dot and a spin - unpolarized electron is in the right dot .",
    "( iii ) the domain @xmath94 : if @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( see fig.3d ) , the left dot is empty .",
    "for the right dot , a spin - down electron occupies the level @xmath2 because of @xmath97 , then the spin - up level of the right dot is pushed to @xmath98 which is over @xmath99 , and so it is empty .",
    "similarly , the other five domains can also be obtained . in the case of the finite coupling case @xmath100",
    ", the spin - polarized domains slightly extend to the spin - unpolarized domains as illustrated in the thin dotted lines in fig.3a .",
    "numerical results for the spin polarizations @xmath64 ( fig.2a and b ) and the occupation numbers of electrons @xmath66 ( fig.2c ) are in a good agreement with the charge stability diagram in fig.3a .",
    "the eight domains , including four spin - unpolarized and four spin - polarized domains , are clearly visible .",
    "in an alternative way , the stability diagram of fig.3a can also be deduced from the total energy of the dqd system and the electrochemical potentials .",
    "when the isolated dqd is in the states of @xmath101 where @xmath102 or @xmath103 is the index of the electron occupation number in the intra - dot level @xmath104 , its total energy @xmath105 is @xmath106with @xmath107 .",
    "consider the fact that the occupation number in the intra - dot level @xmath104 is mainly effected by the lead ( i.e. electron reservoir ) @xmath104 .",
    "the grand thermodynamic potential @xmath108 at the zero temperature is @xmath109 in the present system , the electron occupation number can change with the levels @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this is a grand canonical ensemble .",
    "then the stablest state is one whose grand thermodynamic potential @xmath108 has the minimal values , and can be found straightforwardly . for the sake of convenience and intuition ,",
    "we introduce the electrochemical potentials @xmath112 , following ref.@xcite .",
    "@xmath113 of the level @xmath104 is well defined , for example , @xmath114 then the stablest states are the maximal values of @xmath115 for which four @xmath116 are less than the corresponding chemical potentials @xmath117 . if two states of @xmath115 , e.g. @xmath118 and @xmath119 satisfy the above four equations , they are assumed to have the same probability to exist . a detailed analysis of @xmath120 versus the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath121 leads to establish the same charge stability diagram as shown in fig.3a .",
    "in fact , the electrochemical potentials @xmath113 are equal to the equivalent levels in the preceding paragraph .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xmath122 in particular , there are only four equivalent levels , which are less than the numbers of @xmath113 .",
    "so it is convenient and intuitive to use the equivalent levels to deduce the stability diagram .    with the spin - polarized stability diagram in mind",
    ", we turn to calculate the ( charge ) current @xmath8 induced by the spin bias .",
    "fig.2d shows the current @xmath8 as a function of the levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the current becomes quite large when both the left and right dots are spin polarized in the case of @xmath123 .",
    "the physical origin of generation of the current has been explained in detail in the introduction and as shown in fig.1 .",
    "we can establish a relation between the charge current and the spin bias in the two leads . in this way",
    ", we can detect the spin bias @xmath36 by measuring the current @xmath8 . in the following",
    "we calculate the current for various parameters .",
    "fig.4a shows the current @xmath8 versus the spin bias @xmath36 for the inter - dot interaction @xmath124 . while @xmath125",
    ", @xmath8 is zero exactly . with the increase of @xmath36 from zero ,",
    "the current @xmath8 first increases , reaches at a maximum , and then drops .",
    "@xmath8 keeps a relatively large value even if @xmath36 is comparable with the e - e interaction energy @xmath126 .",
    "the origin of the drop is that the spin - polarizations in two dots decay while the current flows through the dqds at the large @xmath36 . in the absence of the inter - dot e - e interaction @xmath20 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath127 , the current increases monotonously with the spin bias @xmath36 ( see fig.4b ) . in this case the current @xmath8 and the spin bias @xmath36 have a one - to - one correspondence .",
    "therefore the spin bias @xmath36 can be deduced straightforward from the measured current .",
    "fig.4c shows the current @xmath8 as a function of the right - dot s level @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath98 departs @xmath128 over a few @xmath129 ( e.g. @xmath130 ) , @xmath8 becomes very small because the tunneling process in fig.1a suppresses quickly when @xmath98 is not in alignment with @xmath128 . on the other hand ,",
    "the tunneling process in fig.1a occurs frequently and @xmath8 becomes large when @xmath131 is located near @xmath128 .",
    "however , when @xmath132 , @xmath8 may drop slightly and a dip emerges in the curve of @xmath8-@xmath2 , because the spin - polarization @xmath133 is suppressed at the point .",
    "fig.4d displays the current @xmath8 as a function of temperature @xmath134 . here",
    "@xmath8 depends on the temperature @xmath134 slightly , and is quite large when @xmath135 .",
    "in the preceding section , we calculated the charge current through a dqd induced by a pure spin bias . in an open circuit , the situation will be changed . at the time that a spin bias is turned on",
    ", a charge current will circulate .",
    "for an open circuit , the extra charge will accumulate in the two leads until the system reaches at a balance . as a result",
    "an extra charge bias @xmath136 instead of a charge current will be generated while the charge current vanishes . in this case ,",
    "combination of the the spin bias @xmath36 and the induced charge bias @xmath136 will give the spin - dependent chemical potentials @xmath117 in the two leads    @xmath137    the bias @xmath136 can be determined by the condition of    @xmath138    in equilibrium for an open circuit .",
    "5a and 5b gives the bias @xmath136 and @xmath139 versus the spin bias @xmath36 in the presence and absence of the intra - dot coulomb interaction @xmath20 . @xmath140 and @xmath141 increase monotonously with @xmath36 regardless of the value of @xmath20 .",
    "this is different from the curve of @xmath8-@xmath36 , in which @xmath8 drops down for a large @xmath36 while @xmath142 ( see fig.4a ) .",
    "this illustrates that it is more efficient to measure the induced bias @xmath136 than to measure the induced current @xmath8 .",
    "fig.5c shows the bias @xmath136 as a function of the level @xmath2 .",
    "the bias @xmath140 always has a large value ( e.g. @xmath143 ) , even if @xmath144 is far away from @xmath128 .",
    "notice that the current @xmath8 is relatively small when @xmath145 ( see fig.4c ) .",
    "the transmission coefficient ( or the conductance ) is also very small in this region .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath136 in an open circuit is still large",
    ". therefore the induced bias @xmath136 can be measured in an more extensive region .",
    "fig.5d gives the temperature @xmath134 dependence of the bias @xmath136 , which is almost independent of the temperature @xmath134 .",
    "finally , we emphasize that @xmath141 is usually larger than @xmath146 regardless of the values of the parameters @xmath36 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath134 , etc . in the current technology ,",
    "the bias in the order of @xmath147 is measurable in experiment.@xcite therefore , if the spin bias @xmath36 , i.e. the difference of the spin - up and spin - down chemical potentials @xmath148 , reaches to @xmath149 , the induced bias in the present calculation is large enough to be measured in experiment .",
    "in summary , we investigated the electron transport driven by a spin bias or pure spin current through a non - magnetic dqd . except for the spin - unpolarized domains ,",
    "several spin - polarized domains are found in the stability diagram with respect to the energy levels of two quantum dots .",
    "when both of the left and right dots are spin polarization , a large charge current @xmath8 can be induced by applying of the pure spin bias . in particular , in an open circuit , the charge bias is induced to balance the spin bias , and is measurable in an extensive range of the parameters .",
    "physically , a pure spin bias may drive electrons with different spin in opposite direction .",
    "if the system possesses the left - right symmetry or parity and does not break the time reversal symmetry it will circulate a pure spin current ( or spin accumulation in an open circuit ) . when the energy levels in the two dots are not equal , the left - right symmetry or parity of the system is broken . a spin bias and strong coulomb interaction",
    "can produce two spin polarized states in the two dots as we discussed in the spin - polarized charge stability diagram . as a result",
    "the currents with different spins in opposite directions will not be equal any more .",
    "consequently this pure spin bias generates a charge current through the dqd .",
    "this property may provide a practical approach to detect the spin bias in dqd by measuring the charge bias or charge current .",
