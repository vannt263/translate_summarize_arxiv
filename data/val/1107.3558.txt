    ", the density threshold @xmath57 for clustered star formation probably represents the mean density above which the formation of local density peaks with @xmath132 is favoured in supersonically turbulent gas _ ( see * ? ? ?",
    "+ note that the slope of the msf limit in the @xmath133 space is 1.3 .",
    "neither is the msf limit a relation of constant mean surface density , nor is it a relation of constant mean volume density ( although the model hinges on a volume density threshold for star formation ) .",
    "the one property common to all clumps along the msf limit is the mass of star - forming gas , either on a star - cluster - scale ( @xmath134 , @xmath135 ) , or on a pre - stellar core scale ( @xmath136 , @xmath137 ) .",
    "the analysis of the impact exerted by a tidal field upon star clusters which have expelled their residual star - forming gas has been carried out .",
    "it shows that the time - invariant shape of the young star cluster mass function is robustly reproduced if the mean _ volume _ density of cluster - forming regions ( cfrgs ) is constant . if the mass - radius relation of cfrgs were one of constant mean _ surface _",
    "density , it would lead to the preferential removal of high mass - clusters , which contradicts observational results .",
    "these trends follow from how cfrg volume density and cfrg mass scale with each other .",
    "this stellar - dynamics - based finding is independently confirmed by studies mapping star formation activity in molecular clumps , molecular clouds and galaxies , which all show that star formation is driven by a volume ( number ) density threshold .",
    "that star formation takes place in gas denser than a given number density threshold , @xmath51 , and that molecular clumps are characterized by density gradients allow us to define two distinct regions in molecular clumps : a central dense cfrg , and an outer envelope inert in terms of star formation due to @xmath138 . as a result , properties ( e.g. mass , radius , mean volume densities ) of cfrgs and molecular clumps get dissociated .",
    "building on that picture , i put forward an original explanation for why the mass function of young star clusters is steeper than that of molecular clumps and clouds .",
    "the mass - radius relation of molecular clouds and , possibly , of star - forming clumps , is one of constant mean surface density .",
    "this contrasts with the constant mean volume density inferred for cfrgs .",
    "this difference in slope in their respective mass - radius relations steepens the mass function of cfrgs compared to that of their host - clumps because clumps of higher mass have a lower mean volume density ( hence a smaller fraction of star - forming gas ) at constant mean surface density .",
    "finally , the same model is successfully applied to understand the origin of the massive star formation limit ( msf ) in the mass - size space of molecular structures .",
    "this is shown to be consistent with a _ threshold in star - forming gas mass _ beyond which the star - forming gas reservoir is large enough to allow the formation of massive stars .",
    "specifically , the msf limit is consistent with the formation of a @xmath106-star out of its individual density peak with @xmath139 , or with the formation of a @xmath106-star as a cfrg member with @xmath57 .",
