    "electromagnetic - nuclear moments are one of the most important fundamental properties of a nucleus and provide key information on nuclear structure .",
    "the electromagnetic moments are one - body operators acting on a single nuclear state and are very sensitive to the wave function of a specific nuclear state .",
    "they are complementary to transition moments , which are two body operators acting on two different nuclear states .",
    "recent developments in the production of nuclear spin polarization as well as in the production of radioactive - nuclear beams have made it possible to perform studies on nuclear moments away from the stability line in the nuclear chart .",
    "fast rare isotope beams are considered here and the polarization is produced in projectile - fragmentation @xcite or nucleon pick - up @xcite reactions .",
    "nuclear moments of such unstable nuclei , whose production rates become small as the nuclei move further from the stability line , are measured with the @xmath0-ray detecting nuclear magnetic resonance ( @xmath0-nmr ) technique @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-nmr technique is a highly precise and sensitive technique and requires at least 10@xmath1 spins to generate the nmr signal compared to greater than 10@xmath2 spins in the conventional nmr technique .",
    "this is because the nmr signal in the @xmath0-nmr technique is obtained by detecting the radioactivity from the nucleus , namely from the asymmetric @xmath0-ray angular distribution from the decaying polarized nuclei .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0-nmr technique is widely used in a variety of fields , for example , in research on nuclear structure@xcite , fundamental symmetries of the weak interaction @xcite and condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "measurements of magnetic - dipole moments of unstable nuclei were successfully performed at national superconducting cyclotron laboratory at michigan state university ( nscl / msu ) to study nuclear structure and charge symmetry of mirror nuclei @xcite . as a next step ,",
    "electric quadrupole moment measurements are planned to determine nuclear charge distributions and provide information on the deformation of exotic nuclei .",
    "the challenge in the measurements of quadrupole moments is the small nmr signal scattered over a wide range of radio frequencies ( rf ) due to an electric - quadrupole interaction between the quadrupole moment of nucleus and the electric field gradient .",
    "a strong rotating magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) needs to be applied for an efficient @xmath0-nmr measurement .",
    "the @xmath3 must be maintained over a wide range of transition frequencies and a short period of time .",
    "the latter requirement is established by the short - lived nature of the exotic nucleus of interest .",
    "a @xmath0-ray detecting nuclear quadrupole resonance ( @xmath0-nqr ) system has been developed at nscl based on an existing @xmath0-nmr system @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-nqr technique @xcite is a multiple rf nmr technique used to significantly enhance the small nmr signal .",
    "the potential of this technique was demonstrated , for example , in ref .",
    "the system is especially important for nuclei with low production rates , small polarization and/or large nuclear spin .",
    "the present system enables quick and sequential application of rf scattered over a wide range , with the capability to measure magnetic and quadrupole moments of short - lived radioisotopes produced through intermediate - energy reactions .    the electromagnetic interaction of magnetic and quadrupole moments with external fields is briefly reviewed in section 2 .",
    "the principle of the @xmath0-nqr technique is discussed in section 3 and each component of the system is then detailed in section 4 .",
    "the result of verification tests of the @xmath0-nqr system at nscl is discussed in section 5 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the electromagnetic interaction between nuclear moments and external fields @xcite is given by @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the magnetic moment , @xmath6 is the external dipole - magnetic field , @xmath7 is the nuclear spin , @xmath8 is the quadrupole moment , @xmath9 is the third component of the spin operator and @xmath10 are the raising and lowering operators .",

    "the first term in eq . ( [ eq : energy ] ) gives the @xmath22 magnetic sublevels separated by a fixed energy value determined from the applied dipole - magnetic field and size of the nuclear @xmath23 factor due to the magnetic interaction ( zeeman splitting ) .",
    "these sublevels are further shifted by the electric interaction and the energy spacing between adjacent sublevels is no longer constant .",
    "the 2@xmath7 separate transition frequencies appear as @xmath24 since the transition frequencies correspond to the energy difference between two adjacent energy levels ( @xmath25 ) in eq .",

    "the @xmath0-nqr technique @xcite is an nmr technique used for short - lived @xmath0-decaying nuclei . an asymmetric @xmath0-ray angular distribution from nuclear - spin polarized nuclei is utilized to obtain an nmr signal .",
    "the @xmath0-nqr measurement starts with the production of nuclear - spin polarized nuclei .",
    "the polarized nuclei are then implanted into a single crystal within a dipole magnet for the nuclei to be exposed to well - defined electromagnetic fields .",
    "the application of @xmath3 and further manipulation of nuclear spins induces a change in the asymmetric @xmath0-ray angular distribution from the polarized nuclei .",
    "the asymmetry change is detected as a function of applied rf to deduce the magnetic and/or quadrupole moment .",

    "projectile fragmentation or nucleon pick - up reactions are used to produce the nuclei of interest in a spin - polarized state .",
    "a few percent nuclear polarization is typically realized from these reactions @xcite .",
    "generally , alignment and higher - order tensor polarizations may also be produced , depending on the experimental conditions and the nuclear spin . since the @xmath0-nmr technique is sensitive to the polarization ( and the odd rank of higher - order tensor polarizations ) , only polarization is discussed in this work for simplicity . the nuclear polarization @xmath27 is defined by a linear distribution of populations in energy levels @xmath28 given in eq .",

    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) by @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is a change of polarization between rf on and off .",
    "the polarization change takes the maximum number @xmath37 if transitions among all sublevels are saturated and all populations are equalized by the applied rf .",
    "this gives the maximum nmr signal as @xmath38 .",
    "the magnetic moment is obtained by locating the single resonance frequency corresponding to the larmor frequency , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : frequency ] ) .",
    "the quadrupole moment , on the other hand , is obtained by locating the @xmath39 transition frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ eq : frequency ] ) .",
    "the conventional @xmath0-nmr technique relies on detecting each of these @xmath39 transition frequencies from independent measurements .",
    "a single frequency is applied and the entire range of rf swept .",
    "the nmr signal is significantly smaller than the maximum signal expected from the initial polarization because the application of one transition frequency induces only a partial reduction of initial polarization .",
    "the maximum nmr signal , on the other hand , can be achieved if all @xmath39 transition frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ eq : frequency ] ) are applied , resulting in the total destruction of the initial polarization .",
    "this technique is called the @xmath0-nqr technique .",
    "note that the nucleus of interest is short lived and the rf has to be applied in a period of time shorter than the lifetime of the nucleus . assuming a linear distribution of populations in @xmath28 as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is a nonzero constant , the @xmath0-nqr technique is @xmath43 times more efficient than the conventional @xmath0-nmr technique .",
    "for example , a one - day measurement of the quadrupole moment of an @xmath7 = 3/2 nucleus with the @xmath0-nqr technique would require 300 days of measurement with the conventional @xmath0-nmr technique .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath0-nqr technique with zero external magnetic field @xcite may be a powerful technique to enhance the efficiency of quadrupole moment measurements . at zero magnetic field",
    ", the number of resonance transitions is reduced due to the degeneracy between @xmath44 states , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "the structure of the resonance spectrum becomes simpler than that obtained in the @xmath0-nqr technique with and external dipole - magnetic field .",
    "there is only one transition frequency in the special cases ( @xmath7 = 1 , @xmath45 = 0 or @xmath7 = 3/2 ) for the measurement of quadrupole moment .",
    "however , multiple transition frequencies appear in general cases , where the present @xmath0-nqr system may play an essential role for reasons discussed in this paper .",
    "frequency modulation ( fm ) of each transition frequency is used to search a wide range of electric coupling constants for resonances .",
    "the wide fm is important especially during the initial search for resonances .",
    "the observed polarization after the irradiation time of @xmath3 is given by @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the initial polarization , @xmath48 is the transition probability between two magnetic sub - level populations and @xmath49 is the rf time @xcite . here a long spin - lattice relaxation time is assumed . the applied width of the fm will determine the rf power , namely the required strength of @xmath3 , to efficiently destroy the initial polarization .",
    "the fm is defined by the modulating frequency @xmath50 and time @xmath51 , needed to scan the applied fm , as @xmath52 , where the frequency at time @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 with the initial frequency @xmath55 .",

    "a wide fm compared to the line width of the resonance is assumed to obtain the final approximation .",
    "a wide frequency modulation requires high @xmath3 amplitude to keep a fixed magnitude of the transition probability .",
