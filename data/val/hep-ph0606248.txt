    "we note that this contribution arises from loop momenta of order @xmath9 , and that the precise numerical coefficient can not be obtained without knowing the structure of the theory above this scale .",
    "we therefore follow the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite and employ nda to estimate these high momentum contributions .",
    "we see that the one - loop contribution to the 5d mass term provides a strong constraint on @xmath65 but no constraint on the parameter @xmath66 . in general",
    ", @xmath80 are unrelated parameters in the theory .",
    "if the new physics were to have no specific flavor symmetry / antisymmetry it might be natural for @xmath80 to be of similar magnitude .",
    "alternatively , given the strong constraint on @xmath65 arising from eq.([c+5d ] ) , a sizable magnetic moment requires @xmath81 .",
    "we identify two scenarios , to be discussed below :    * @xmath82 * arbitrary @xmath83      we have seen that the flavor antisymmetric operator @xmath64 does not contribute to the 5d neutrino mass term at 1-loop order ; thus a direct constraint on the magnetic moment is not obtained from the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:5d ] .",
    "however , suppose we had a theory in which the coefficients of @xmath63 and @xmath64 were of similar magnitude , @xmath85 .",

    "we emphasize that eq.([special ] ) is not a model - independent constraint , as in general @xmath63 and @xmath64 are unrelated .",
    "while it might seem natural for the the new physics to generate coefficients of similar size for both operators , we could obtain finite @xmath66 and vanishing @xmath65 ( at tree - level ) by imposing an appropriate flavor symmetry .",
    "we now consider the more general case where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are unrelated , and directly derive constraints on the the coefficient of the flavor antisymmetric operator , @xmath66 .",
    "as the operator @xmath64 is flavor antisymmetric , it must be multiplied by another flavor antisymmetric contribution in order to produce a flavor symmetric mass term .",
    "this can be accomplished through insertion of yukawa couplings in the diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7d ]  @xcite .",
    "this diagram provides a logarithmically divergent contribution to the 7d mass term , given by @xmath87_{\\alpha\\beta } \\simeq \\frac{3 g^2}{16 \\pi^2 } \\frac{m_\\alpha^2 - m_\\beta^2}{v^2 }   \\ln \\frac{\\lambda^2}{m_w^2 } \\left [ c_w^-(\\lambda ) \\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 are the charged lepton masses , and the exact coefficient has been computed using dimensional regularization and renormalized with modified minimal subtraction .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : owminusone ] ) gives the @xmath64 contribution to the neutrino mass from all scales between @xmath9 and the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking to leading log order .",
    "moreover , while all contributions of the type @xmath88 could be resummed using the renormalization group , a study of analogous operator mixing for dirac neutrinos@xcite suggests that it is sufficient to retain only the leading log contribution . using this result  as well as eqs .",
    "( [ munu ] ) and ( [ mnu ] ) to relate @xmath66 and @xmath89 to @xmath90 and @xmath8 respectively  leads to bound ( i ) in table  [ summary ] .",
    "note that this provides a weaker constraint than that in eq.([special ] ) , as it is suppressed by the charged lepton masses , and also only logarithmically dependent on the scale of new physics @xmath9 .",
    "the neutrino magnetic moment operator @xmath64 will also contribute to the 5d mass operator _ via _ two - loop matching of the effective theory onto the full theory at @xmath91 .    an illustrative contribution is shown in fig .  [ fig:2loop ] .",
    "as with the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig:7d ] , we require two yukawa insertions in order to obtain a flavor symmetric result .",
    "this diagram contributes to the 5d mass operator , and we again provide an nda estimate : @xmath92_{\\alpha\\beta } \\simeq   \\frac{g^2}{(16 \\pi^2)^2 } \\frac{m_\\alpha^2 - m_\\beta^2}{v^2 }   \\left [   c_w^- ( \\lambda)\\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}. \\label{5d1}\\ ] ] again , using eqs.([munu ] ) and ( [ mnu ] ) , this leads to bound ( ii ) in table  [ summary ] . in doing so",
    ", we have neglected the running of the operator coefficients from the scale @xmath9 to @xmath93 since the effects are higher order in the gauge couplings and have a negligible numerical impact on our analysis .",
    "compared to 1-loop ( 7d ) case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : owminusone ] ) , the 2-loop ( 5d ) matching leads to a mass contribution that is suppressed by a factor of @xmath94 arising from the additional loop , but enhanced by a factor of @xmath95 arising from the lower operator dimension .",
    "thus , as we increase the new physics scale , @xmath9 , this two - loop constraint rapidly becomes more restrictive and nominally provides a stronger constraint than the 1-loop result once @xmath96 tev .",
    "inclusion of the logarithmic @xmath9-dependence of one - loop mixing implies that the crossover \" scale between the two effects is closer to @xmath97 tev .",
    "unlike the case of the @xmath26 gauge boson , where a flavor symmetric operator @xmath63 exists , the operator @xmath56 is purely flavor antisymmetric .",
    "therefore , it can not contribute to the @xmath54 mass term at one loop . as was noticed in @xcite ,",
    "the one - loop contribution of @xmath56 to the @xmath55 mass term also vanishes .      if we insert @xmath56 in the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig:7d ] , the contribution vanishes , due to the @xmath98 structure of the graph . therefore , to obtain a non - zero contribution to @xmath55 from @xmath56",
    "we require the presence of some non - trivial @xmath98 structure .",
    "this can arise , for instance , from a virtual @xmath99 boson loop as in fig .",
    "[ fig : b2m_2loop ]  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism gives the leading contribution of the operator @xmath56 to the 7d mass term .",
    "the @xmath56 and @xmath57 contributions to the 7d mass term are thus related by @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the weak mixing angle and where the factor on the rhs is due to the additional @xmath26 boson loop .",
    "this additional loop suppression for the @xmath56 contribution results in a significantly weaker neutrino magnetic moment constraint than that obtained above @xmath64 .",
    "the corresponding limit is shown as bound ( iii ) in table  [ summary ] .",
    "however , the leading contribution of @xmath56 to the 5d mass term arises from the same 2-loop matching considerations ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2loop ] ) that we discussed in connection with the @xmath64 operator .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the 5d mass term is the same as that for @xmath57 , except for a factor of @xmath102 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath103_{\\alpha\\beta } \\simeq   \\frac{g'^2}{(16 \\pi^2)^2 } \\frac{m_\\alpha^2 - m_\\beta^2}{v^2 }   \\left [ c_b(\\lambda )   \\right]_{\\alpha\\beta}\\ \\ \\ , \\label{5db}\\ ] ] corresponding to bound ( iv ) in table .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "importantly , this is the strongest constraint on the @xmath56 contribution to the neutrino magnetic moment for any value of @xmath9 .",
    "all the magnetic moment bounds presented in table  [ summary ] contain the factor @xmath104 .",
    "this factor arises from the yukawa insertions that are necessary to obtain flavor symmetric mass terms from the flavor antisymmetric magnetic moment operators .",
    "the strongest constraints are those for the @xmath27 and @xmath28 transition moments , as @xmath105 .",
    "however @xmath106 , so the constraint on the @xmath107 transition moment is much weaker .    in the foregoing analysis",
    ", it was convenient to work in the flavor basis ( where the charged lepton masses are diagonal ) .",
    "however , given @xmath108 , we can use neutrino mixing matrix to determine @xmath109 , where @xmath110 denote neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "rotating the neutrino magnetic moments from the flavor basis to the mass basis gives @xmath111 since most elements of @xmath112 are large , it would be natural to expect that all elements of @xmath109 would be of similar size .",
    "in particular , all elements of @xmath109 will receive a contribution from @xmath113 ( the most weakly constrained element in the flavor basis . )",
    "therefore the @xmath113 constraint will translate into similar limits for all elements of @xmath109 .",
    "we have discussed radiative corrections to the neutrino mass arising from a neutrino magnetic moment coupling . expressing the magnetic moment in terms of effective operators in a model independent fashion required constructing operators containing the @xmath26 and hypercharge gauge bosons , @xmath57 and @xmath56 respectively , rather than working directly with the electromagnetic gauge boson .",
    "we then calculated @xmath0 naturalness bounds arising from the leading order contributions to both the 5d and 7d majorana mass terms .",
    "these bounds are summarized in table  [ summary ] .    at the tev scale , the strongest",
    "bound comes from a 1-loop contribution to the 7d mass term as previously discussed in  @xcite [ limit ( i ) in table  [ summary ] ] .",

    "the bound on the @xmath107 transition moment is weaker than current experimental limits .",
    "however , we have shown that 2-loop contributions to the 5d mass term always provide the strongest bound on @xmath115 [ limit ( iv ) in table  [ summary ] ] and also provides the strongest bound on @xmath114 provided @xmath31 tev [ limit ( ii ) in table  [ summary ] ] .",
    "we have estimated this contribution  associated with matching the effective theory onto the ( unspecified ) full theory at high scales  using nda .",
