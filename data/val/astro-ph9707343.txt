    "cosmological cold dark matter theories of structure formation in the universe via hierarchical merging are in some difficulty .",
    "recent high - resolution cosmological n - body simulations ( navarro et al . 1996a , 1997 ) have substantially improved our understanding of the equilibrium density profiles which dark matter halos achieve when formed through hierarchical clustering .",
    "it has been shown that the violent , collisionless dynamical relaxation processes during the formation phase of dark matter halos lead to equilibrium profiles that have similar shapes , independent of halo mass , initial density fluctuation spectrum , and adopted cosmological model .",
    "all dark matter profiles can be well fit by the simple formulae for density and mass : @xmath0 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the density of the dark matter halo evaluated at the scale radius @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the characteristic mass ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( or @xmath1 ) are free parameters .",
    "@xmath3 is a function of the total virial mass @xmath4 inside the virial radius @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath5 denotes the radius inside which the averaged overdensity of dark matter is 200 times the critical density of the universe .",
    "the simulations also show that , for any particular cosmology , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are strongly correlated : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is approximately 1.4 for low - mass dark matter halos as considered in this paper .",
    "low - mass halos are denser than more massive systems .",
    "this results from the fact that lower mass halos form earlier , at times when the universe is significantly denser .",
    "dark matter halos therefore represent a 1-parameter family , being completely described by equation 1 and their virial mass @xmath4 or virial radius @xmath5 .",
    "the universal profile has been verified by simulations to halo masses as small as @xmath9 but there is no reason to believe that these results would not be valid for halos which are even one order of magnitude lower in mass .",
    "substantial progress has also been made within the past decade on the observational front .",
    "the observations show that the rotation curves of low - luminosity disk galaxies and low - surface brightness galaxies are strongly dark matter - dominated ( persic & salucci 1988 , 1990 , puche & carignan 1991 , broeils 1992 , persic et al .",
    "1996 , de blok et al .",
    "the spherically - averaged mass distributions @xmath10 can be derived from the measured circular velocity distributions @xmath11 of gaseous galactic disks .",
    "subtraction of the contributions by the visible components gives the dark matter mass profiles @xmath12 or the corresponding dark matter rotation curves @xmath13 .",
    "given these theoretical and observational developments , an important question arises as to whether the theoretically predicted rotation curves , determined by equation 1 , are in agreement with the observations .",
    "the low - surface brightness dwarf galaxy ddo 154 has one of the most extended and best - studied dark matter halo rotation curves ( carignan & freeman 1988 , carignan & beaulieu 1989 , carignan & purton 1997 ) , with a precise decomposition into contributions from stars , gas and dark matter .",
    "it is also one of the most gas - rich systems known with an inner stellar disk component of mass @xmath14 and an extended hi disk with scale radius of @xmath15 kpc and mass of approximately @xmath16 ( carignan & beaulieu 1989 ) .",
    "the shape of the rotation curve , even in the innermost regions , is completely dominated by the dark matter halo with a total mass within @xmath5 of about @xmath17 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "ddo 154 is a good candidate with which to test cosmological models .",
    "1 ( upper panel ) shows the dark matter rotation curve of ddo 154 and compares it with the profiles predicted from cosmological models .",
    "the stellar disk and the hi contribution ( carignan & freeman 1988 ) have been subtracted , adopting a stellar mass - to - light ratio of ( m / l@xmath18)@xmath19 = 1 .",
    "the error bars indicate the uncertainties in the observations .",
    "note that the data extends out to 21 disk scale lengths and that the rotation curve clearly decreases beyond 5 kpc .",
    "the thick dashed and dotted curves fit the theoretically predicted rotation curves as determined by equation 1 to the innermost and outermost regions , respectively . fitting the inner regions ( dotted curve , labeled a ) is well known to pose a problem ( flores & primack 1994 , moore 1994 , burkert 1995 ) as the theoretical models predict a central @xmath20 density cusp , whereas the observed velocity profile indicates a large isothermal core with a constant density . as a result ,",
    "the theoretical models lead to far more mass in the innermost region than is seen .",
    "it has been suggested that this discrepancy could be solved by assuming secular processes ( e.g. violent galactic winds ) in the baryonic component ( navarro et al .",
    "1996b ) which could also affect the innermost parts of dark matter halos .",
    "however a similar problem exists in the outermost regions . whereas the observed dark matter rotation curve clearly decreases beyond 5 kpc ,",
    "the theoretically predicted universal profile fit leads to a very massive and extended halo ( @xmath21 kpc , where @xmath22 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath23 mpc@xmath23 ) with a rotation curve that increases beyond 8 kpc .",
    "the outer regions certainly can not be affected by secular mass loss involving a baryonic component , and a different explanation must be sought . the dashed line in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 ( labeled b ) shows a fit to the outer rotation curve of ddo 154 . in this case",
    "the dark matter excess in the inner regions is unacceptably large.approximately @xmath24 in dark matter would have to be moved from the inner 2 kpc into the region between 2 kpc and 4 kpc to explain the discrepancy between the observed inner rotation curve and the predicted one .",
    "this is far more than would be expected as a result of secular processes .",
    "figure 2 compares the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 ( see equation 1 ) , derived from fitting the inner or outer rotation curve of ddo 154 with the standard , cluster - normalized cdm predictions ( navarro et al 1996a , 1997 ) .",
    "note that both fits require pairs of parameter values which are not in agreement with theory . in order to lie within the expected parameter range one would have to choose values for @xmath3 and @xmath2 which do not fit the rotation curve , either in the inner or in the outer regime .",
    "what is wrong with either cdm or with the failure to fit the rotation curve of ddo 154 ? there is accumulating evidence that the cdm models can account for many aspects of large - scale structure and therefore should not be dismissed .",
    "errors in determining the rotation curve of ddo 154 are equally unlikely due to its very regular velocity field from which @xmath11 can be derived and unambiguously corrected for warping . as described above , secular processes can not explain the discrepancy .",
    "there also can not exist much more mass in the hi disk , e.g. in @xmath25 , as such a massive disk would be gravitationally unstable and would efficiently form molecular clouds and stars , in contradiction to the observations .",
    "we propose , that in addition to the cdm dark matter halo which can be represented by the one - parameter family of universal profiles , ddo 154 contains a second dark but compact baryonic component whose presence we infer in order to explain the observed rotation curve . because of the arguments mentioned above , this new component can not be gaseous and located in the disk .",
    "we identify it with a _ spheroidal distribution of massive compact baryonic objects , machos _ , located in the inner regions of the dark matter halo .",
    "there is in fact ample room for such a subdominant baryonic component , relative to the massive dark halos of the standard cdm theory in the form of machos .",
    "primordial nucleosynthesis requires a baryonic component of @xmath26 ( kurki - suonio , jedamzik & mathews 1997 , copi , schramm & turner 1995 ) whereas the observed value for stellar and gaseous components in disks lies in the range of @xmath27 ( persic & salucci 1992 , note that @xmath28 for ddo 154 , assuming @xmath29 ) . where are all these additional baryons ?",
    "most of them should be found in galaxies unless winds have strongly depleted all the initial baryons during the protogalaxy phase . even if protogalactic winds have occurred , as is suggested by theory and observation , it is unlikely that all of the baryons that are not in the disk would have been lost .",
    "the recent macho experiments ( alcock et al . 1996 ) demonstrate that there indeed exists a substantial baryonic component in a more extended , spheroidal distribution in the milky way , at least between the sun and the lmc , in addition to the observed stellar and gaseous baryonic components .",
    "it is likely that a similar , yet hitherto unobserved , component also exists in ddo 154 .",
    "the mass distribution @xmath30 of the proposed spheroidal dark baryonic component is determined by @xmath31 which is the difference in total mass inside a radius @xmath32 as expected from the dark matter rotation curve @xmath33 and the dark matter mass @xmath34 inside @xmath32 .",
    "we consider two extreme possibilities for determining @xmath35 .",
    "one possibility is just to adopt the universal profile predicted by hierarchical infall models ( equation 1 ) : @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the baryonic dark component formed at the same time or even earlier than the extended dark halo . in the opposite limit we imagine that the macho spheroid formed after the extended dark halo profile was established . in this case , if the dark baryonic component is of comparable mass inside a certain radius , the dark halo within this radius will undergo adiabatic contraction . for simplicity we will assume spherical symmetry and a formation timescale of the macho halo which is long compared to the dynamical timescale of the dark halo . in this case",
    "the corrected dark matter mass profile is determined by ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath37 where @xmath12 is determined by equation 1 and @xmath38 inserting @xmath39 ( equation 3 ) into equation 4 and choosing values for @xmath3 and @xmath2 , one can determine iteratively the adiabatically contracted dark matter mass profile @xmath34 and @xmath30 .",
    "our approach seems at first sight a very contrived solution to the problem of the rotation curve , as we attribute the discrepancy between observations and theory to a third , invisible component which introduces an extra degree of freedom .",
    "how can this idea be tested ? there",
    "exist in fact very strong constraints on the shape of @xmath30 , which must be fulfilled in order for our model to be physically correct .",
    "first of all , the total mass distribution of the dark spheroid has to be positive everywhere and increase monotonically with increasing radius , up to a maximum radius @xmath40 beyond which it has to remain constant .",
    "second , the density of the spheroid @xmath41 must decrease monotonically with increasing radius .",
    "these constraints require that the dark matter rotation curve lies everywhere below the observed rotation curve .",
    "dark matter fits like the curves labeled a and b in the upper panel of fig .",
    "1 are ruled out .",
    "@xmath40 could in principle lie outside the observed radius regime .",
    "however for ddo 154 the measured rotation curve extends out to 21 disk scale lengths .",
    "we identify the dark spheroid with an intermediate baryonic component that presumably formed during the dissipative protogalactic collapse phase , and which should therefore be more centrally concentrated than the dark matter halo .",
    "the rotation curve of ddo 154 clearly decreases outside 5 kpc , and this indicates that a large fraction of its mass lies at smaller radii . as the dark matter halo dominates the total mass in the outer regions , we expect that the mass distribution of the baryonic spheroid becomes constant and equal to its total mass @xmath42 at a radius @xmath43 kpc .",
    "note that the radial dependence of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is given by the observations and equation 1 .",
    "it is therefore not trivial that the difference of the terms on the right hand side of equation 3 gives a profile which meets all of the constraints mentioned above , even if the dark matter scale parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 are treated as free parameters .",
    "we have indeed found such a solution , however only for very special values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , values which for the models with and without adiabatic contraction lie within the small shaded and dark regions of figure 2 , respectively .",
    "these sets of solutions uniquely determine the total mass of the spheroid @xmath42 , and hence , via equation 2 , the total mass @xmath4 of the dark matter halo .",
    "the solid lines in the upper and lower panels of figure 1 provide an excellent fit to the rotation curve , adopting our macho model with the non - baryonic dark matter halo parameters fixed at @xmath46 and @xmath47 kpc for the case without adiabatic contraction and @xmath48 and @xmath49 kpc if adiabatic contraction is included .",
    "the inserts within figure 2 show the mass and density profiles of the dark baryonic spheroid and the dark matter halo without and with adiabatic contraction .",
    "note that in the former case without adiabatic contraction , the macho component would dominate the inner mass and density distribution , whereas in the latter case the baryonic and non - baryonic halos have comparable masses in the inner region .",
    "for all acceptable models we find @xmath50 kpc , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the density profiles of the macho component can be well approximated by an isothermal sphere with a constant velocity dispersion of @xmath53 km / s .",
    "there exists an additional independent constraint in order for our model to be acceptable within the framework of standard cosmology : @xmath3 and @xmath2 must follow the tight relationship , predicted by cosmological models . indeed , figure 2 shows that the values which have to be adopted in order to give a physically correct mass distribution overlap with the parameter space of values expected from standard cosmology , in contrast to the one - component dark matter fits ( starred points ) .",
    "moreover , as we identify the dark spheroid with the missing baryonic component , early universe nucleosynthesis requires that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the total visible mass of ddo 154 . for the areas of possible solutions",
    "we find a dark - to - luminous mass fraction of approximately 6 , in agreement with the expectations .",
    "note that an arbitrary choice of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath39 would almost certainly fail to meet all of these constraints .",
    "the excellent agreement of our model with the predictions from cosmological models of structure formation and primordial nucleosynthesis provides additional evidence for the presence of a dark baryonic component in ddo 154 .",
    "our three component model of luminous baryons in a disk configuration , and machos and cold dark matter in a spheroidal distribution , can reconcile the most detailed observations of a rotation curve to date with the hierarchical clustering theory of galaxy formation .",
    "this might be the first ( indirect ) detection of a macho component in another galaxy .",
    "it also has allowed us to study in detail for the first time the internal density distribution of a dark baryonic spheroid due to the excellent high - resolution data of ddo 154 s rotation curve .",
    "the structure of the macho spheroid in ddo 154 is surprisingly similar to the macho halo of the milky way , the existence and mass of which has been inferred from a completely different method : gravitational microlensing events of stars in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "alcock et al . ( 1996 , 1997 ) find for the galaxy that within 50 kpc ( 14 disk scale lengths ) the total masses of machos and dark matter are comparable and of order @xmath56 .",
    "this is 4 to 5 times the mass of the galactic disk ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "the dark baryonic spheroid of ddo 154 also extends out to 14 disk scale lengths at which radius the mass of the macho halo is again similar to the mass of the dark matter halo , with , in this case , a mass of order @xmath58 .",
    "the inferred macho mass is also of order 5 times the mass of the hi disk .",
    "this agreement in the relative mixture of dark matter , machos and disk material indicates that these components formed in both galaxies from a similar continuous dynamical process , with the macho spheroid representing a presumably dissipative component intermediate between the collisionless non - baryonic dark halo and the strongly collisional , dissipation - dominated , rotationally - supported disk .",
    "this might provide an explanation for the puzzling observational result that disk galaxies have universal rotation curves ( casertano & van gorkom 1991 , rubin et al .",
    "1985 , persic et al . 1996 ) , requiring a connection between their galactic disks and their dark spheroidal components .",
    "universal rotation curves would be expected for galaxies of any mass where the relative mass and radius ratios between the dark matter halo , the macho halo and the disk are universal numbers .",
    "our results indicate that the baryonic component of ddo154 and probably also of other disk galaxies consists of two components , a spheroidal macho component which represents about 22% of the total mass and a visible disk component with only 4% of the total mass .",
    "the total baryon fraction in galaxies is then of the order of a quarter of the total mass , a value which is higher than expected from the primordial nucleosynthesis predictions if the relative mixture of baryonic and non - baryonic matter is universal .",
    "this baryon segregation could result from dissipative processes during the formation of halos which concentrate the baryons relative to the nondissipative dark matter .",
    "the origin of two separate baryonic components , namely a dominant dark spheroidal component and a disk component , is an interesting and yet unsolved theoretical puzzle which could provide important information on the dissipative formation history and evolution of galaxies .",
