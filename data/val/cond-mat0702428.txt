    "the significant advancement in creating and probing excitonic states in quantum dots @xcite and newly developed techniques which allow quantum coupling between excitonic states to be continuously varied by external electric fields @xcite has provided rapid progress in the field of solid - state quantum computation . in the case of two coupled quantum dot systems , exciton - exciton dipole interactions give rise to diagonal terms which allows quantum logic to be performed via ultra - fast laser pulses on time scales less than calculated decoherence times@xcite .",
    "related studies @xcite have suggested the importance of the frster energy transfer process in producing entangled excitonic states and using external electric fields to achieve critical logic gate actions .",
    "dipole - dipole interaction was first proposed by frster@xcite and further extended by dexter@xcite as a mechanism of energy transfer in which excitonic wavefunctions localized at different quantum dots do not overlap .",
    "other than the actual generation of entangled excitonic qubit states , the successful implementation of quantum logic systems depends critically on the decoherence properties of the qubits .",
    "decoherence due to enviromental factors such as phonons and impurities is inevitable and is regarded as a major drawback in solid - state devices .",
    "several strategies such as decoherence - free subspaces @xcite , optimal control techniques @xcite and immunization processes @xcite have been proposed to counter the detrimental effects of decoherence .",
    "geometric quantum computation has gained increased status as a robust fault - tolerant scheme in recent years @xcite .",
    "the geometric phase component ( berry phase ) of the phase shift in quantum states relies solely on the global geometry of the path executed during cyclical evolution and hence is manifestly gauge invariant and consequently insensitive to stochastic operation errors @xcite .",
    "it is not immediately clear however whether these proposals invoke other routes which facilitate decoherence and if so the role played by various system parameters in minimizing errors during logic gate operations .",
    "hence there is a need to scrutinize the various intrinsic processes and in particular phonon induced types in order to achieve fault tolerant quantum switches .",
    "the interaction of charge carriers with acoustic phonons arises mainly from deformation - potential and piezoelectric coupling in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "theoretical estimates by fedichkin at al @xcite show that the error rate due to acoustic phonons may be a major factor limiting qubit performance , in agreement with experimental results @xcite of a qubit system implemented using a double - dot gaas / algaas system with a two dimensional electron gas .",
    "electron - phonon interaction has been shown be significant in gaas / inas quantum dots compared to the bulk system of the same material leading to the formation of polarons @xcite . in another work , jacak and coworkers have studied the significance of relaxation of electrons surrounded by a cloud of phonons due to the anharmonic interaction of optical phonons with acoustic phonons in gaas / inas quantum dot systems @xcite .",
    "a recent study @xcite has considered the possibility of localization@xcite in which an electron state delocalized over two quantum dots is converted into a mixture of two classical - like localized states and consequently loses its coherence to the surrounding reservoir of phonons .",

    "the loss of coherence due to charge carrier movements during oscillations between the different qubit states is unavoidable , and therefore we aim to closely examine this critical mode of decoherence in this work .",
    "we model this route of degradation in the purity and entanglement of qubit states to proceed via a one - phonon assisted oscillation of qubit states leading to relaxation as well as dephasing of the qubit states . in order to obtain explicit results",

    "an earlier work @xcite has examined the coupling of the frster coupled quantum dot system to the external environment consisting of a single radiation mode and the associated spontaneous emission and decay processes .",
    "we are unaware of other detailed studies of phonon mediated interactions involving excitonic qubit states in frster coupled quantum dots .",
    "it is not immediately clear whether decoherence phenomenon is dominated by relaxation or pure dephasing process and the extend to which the outcome is affected by the nature of qubit - phonon coupling during a cycle of logic gate operation .",
    "the subtle difference between relaxation and pure dephasing of entangled systems has to be emphasized . while relaxation brings about shifts in the population of qubits states with one state favored over another , pure dephasing process results in changes in the energy difference between qubit states with the population of qubit states remaining intact .",
    "while both processes lead to decoherence of the entangled system , we aim to examine the various parameters affecting the two inherent sources of dissipation in this work .",
    "our approach undertaken here can be extended to other designs of coupled dot qubit systems such as the electrically controlled charge qubit in the double quantum dot system or the double impurity semiconductor systems @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a quantum system exposed to an environment is best described by the reduced density matrix for which approximation techniques @xcite have been developed to describe the quantum state evolution at times determined by the environmental noise .",
    "non - markovian stochastic schrodinger equations @xcite , lindblad @xcite and redfield master equations @xcite have been independently used to investigate the dynamics of open quantum system in contact with noisy environments . in a recent work ,",
    "braun @xcite showed that two qubits not interacting directly but which are in contact with a common environment can become entangled and the entanglement may last for a long time depending the strength of coupling and environmental conditions .",
    "these results are similar to those obtained by ficek et al @xcite who studied a system of two suitably prepared atoms immersed in a vacuum field .",
    "the term `` sudden death '' has been coined in an earlier work @xcite to describe the process in which two initially entangled atoms which become noninteracting later become completely disentangled in relatively short times .",

    ", we investigate the dynamical behaviour of entanglement of excitons coupled to two phonon baths associated with deformation - potential and piezoelectric coupling in the absence of a direct channel of interaction , i.e the frster interaction is switched off by control of external electric fields .",
    "we follow the approach of tolkunov et al @xcite in which the degree of loss of coherence is determined by the decay of of the off - diagonal terms of the reduced density matrix .",
