    "in molecular solids the energy scales of translation , rotation , and vibration can be expected to be of different orders of magnitude . in the solid hydrogens",
    "@xcite , the rotational lines are clearly distinct from the spectral signatures of the translations and rotations . for a large pressure interval in such systems models of coupled rigid rotors are sufficient to understand the general features of phase transitions in particular those of the orientational kind . in this work",
    "we refer to such systems as orientational crystals .",
    "there exist systems in both two and three dimensions which can be thought of as orientational crystals .",
    "two dimensional examples are physisorbed molecules on inert surfaces , such as n@xmath0 or h@xmath0 and its isotopes on graphite or boron - nitride .",
    "the former can be approximated by a model of planar rotors , known as the anisotropic planar rotor ( apr ) model  @xcite .",
    "this model exhibits an orientational order - disorder phase transition from an orientationally disordered state to the orientationally ordered herringbone structure . in n@xmath0 on a graphite surface",
    "this transition takes place at 30 k  @xcite , well below the liquid - solid ordering temperature of 47 k  @xcite .",
    "while the classical apr model accounts for the orientational ordering , a more quantitative description of the system necessitates the inclusion of quantum effects  @xcite .",
    "also , models of coupled quantum planar rotors are useful in describing other systems , such as granular superconductors  @xcite and more recently the bosonic hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional examples are the solid phases of the hydrogens and different isotopes .",
    "the behavior of the hydrogens is generally made more complex by the fact that ortho - para conversion times are slow on the time - scale of rotations ( in the pressure ranges considered here @xmath1gpa )  @xcite , hence it is a reasonable approximation to take the ortho - para ratio to be a fixed parameter  @xcite .",
    "the existence of ortho and para species is due to the coupling of nuclear spins and the rotational quantum numbers characterizing a particular molecule . for the h@xmath0 molecule a rotation of angle @xmath2 corresponds to an exchange of the constituent atoms , hence the wavefunction has to be anti - symmetric in such a rotation . since the h atoms are of spin @xmath3 , the possible spin states of the molecule as a whole are three symmetric and one anti - symmetric spin state .",
    "to preserve the overall antisymmetry of the wavefunction the symmetric spin states couple with anti - symmetric spatial states ( odd angular momentum or odd-@xmath4 ) and the anti - symmetric spin states couple with symmetric spatial states ( even-@xmath4 ) . in hd , where the atoms are indistinguishable",
    "all angular momentum states are allowed ( all-@xmath4 ) . in d@xmath0",
    "the constituent atoms are bosons , hence the wavefunction has to be symmetric .",
    "however this leads to a qualitatively similar situation : here symmetric(anti - symmetric ) spin - states are even-@xmath4(odd-@xmath4 ) .",
    "the orientational ordering properties of odd-@xmath4 , even-@xmath4 , and all-@xmath4 systems show striking differences .",
    "odd-@xmath4 systems show orientational ordering in the ground state , whereas even-@xmath4 systems order at higher pressures . at low pressures and low temperatures the even-@xmath4 systems",
    "can be thought of as spheres .",
    "an interesting anomalous feature that was first predicted for all-@xmath4 systems is the _ reentrant _ phase diagram . upon cooling , in certain pressure ranges , the system orders orientationally due to a decrease in thermal fluctuations .",
    "in the reentrant region , the orientationally ordered phase is destroyed by quantum fluctuations ( also know as quantum melting ) .",
    "this effect was first predicted in the mean - field phase diagram of the all-@xmath4 hydrogen system ( hd )  @xcite , and experimentally verified thereafter  @xcite .    for the quantum generalization of the apr model ( qapr )",
    "the system corresponding to the all@xmath5 case also shows reentrance .",
    "this was first predicted by mean - field theory  @xcite , and then verified via quantum monte carlo calculations  @xcite as well as quantum monte carlo calculations analyzed via finite size scaling  @xcite .",
    "reentrance was also found in the corresponding model of granular superconductors  @xcite .",
    ".,width=264,height=188 ]    recently a set of studies  @xcite have suggested that if the thermal equilibrium distribution of the ortho - para ratio is reached then reentrance can occur in the homonuclear systems h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 .",
    "this conclusion is supported by experimental evidence  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we give an overview of the mean - field theory of phase transitions in coupled rotors with particular attention to the issues of reentrance , other quantum anomalies , and meta - stability .",

    "we show that the dipolar potential does not exhibit the reentrance anomaly , whereas the quadrupolar one does .",
    "the phase transition turns out to be second order in all cases except for the linear rotors in a quadrupolar potential where it is first order .",
    "we also investigate the effects of the crystal field : in the case of the linear rotor model with quadrupolar potentials the crystal field causes the appearance of critical points which separate lines of the phase diagram where the transition is first order from regions where there is no phase transition , but simply a continuous change of the order parameter  @xcite .",
    "we show that the range over which meta - stable states ( which accompany a first - order phase transition ) depends on the crystal field : as it is increased this region becomes smaller , and disappears when the phase transition itself disappears .",
    "we also analyze the behaviour of the entropy in all cases .",
    "the model we study in this section is described by the hamiltonian @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 denote the rotational constant , the coupling constant , and the strength of the crystal field respectively , and where the sum @xmath10 runs over nearest neighbors .",

    "the phase diagrams separate the orientationally disordered phase ( at lower values of the coupling constant ) from the orientationally ordered phase .",

    "the states are obtained after diagonalizing the hamiltonian ( in the corresponding classical system the sum in the expression for the entropy is an integral over the angles , and the probability is a function of the angles as well ) .",
    "as the lowest state , which dominates the behaviour of the system at low temperatures ( i.e. has the highest probability ) , corresponds to a disordered state , it is not surprising that the entropy decreases and that simultanously the system disorders . in the state - space",
    "to which the probabilities in the entropy expression refer the number of possible states does in fact decrease ( i.e. in that sense the system orders ) , however the states themselves are disordered in real space .",
    "in some sense this picture is similar to bose - einstein condensation  @xcite , where the single lowest state becomes populated ( and which corresponds to a state that is spatially disordered ) , with the important difference that here the state is not a collective state .",

    "it can also be argued that the entropy anomaly is a natural consequence of quantum mechanics : the entropy decreases with temperature , as a single state begins to dominate , but this single state is a delocalized one ( zero angular momentum state ) , hence it is disordered ."
