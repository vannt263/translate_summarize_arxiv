    "research on wave propagation phenomena in periodic media has been very active during many decades .",
    "the topics and applications include for example photonic crystals , meta - materials , bragg gratings of surface plasmon polariton waveguides , energy harvesting in piezoelectric materials as well as surface wave propagation in periodic channels , which is the subject of this paper .",
    "a standard mathematical approach consists of linearisation and posing a spectral problem for an elliptic , hopefully self - adjoint , equation or system .",
    "early on it was noticed that waves propagating in periodic media have spectra with allowed bands separated by forbidden frequency gaps .",
    "this phenomenon was first discussed by lord rayleigh @xcite .",
    "it has also attracted some interest in coastal engineering because it provides a possible means of protection against wave damages @xcite , for example by varying the bottom topography by periodic arrangements of sandbars .",
    "the existence of forbidden frequencies is conventionally related to bragg reflection of water waves by periodic structures . here , bragg reflection is an enhanced reflection which occurs when the wavelength of an incident surface wave is approximately twice the wavelength of the periodic structure .",
    "this mechanism works , if the waves are relatively long so that the depth changes can effect them @xcite .",
    "a similar phenomenon may also happen , when waves are propagating along a channel with periodically varying width .",
    "in @xcite , and later @xcite , the authors studied a channel , the wall of which had a periodic stepped structure . using resonant interaction theory they were able to verify that significant wave reflection could occur .",
    "these results are based on the assumption of small wall irregularities .",
    "gaps in the continuous spectrum for equations or systems in unbounded waveguides have been studied in many papers , and we refer to @xcite for an introduction to the topic . in @xcite",
    "the authors studied the linear elasticity system and proved the existence of arbitrarily ( though still finitely ) many gaps , the number of them depending on a small geometric parameter ; the approach is similar to section 3.1 , below , and the result is analogous to corollary [ cor3.2 ] . in the setting of the linear water - wave problem ,",
    "spectral gaps have been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , though the point of view is different from the present work .    in this paper",
    "we consider surface wave propagation using the linear water wave equation with spectral steklov boundary condition on the free water surface , see the equations  , which are called the original problem here .",
    "the water - filled domain @xmath4 forms an unbounded periodic channel consisting of infinitely many identical bounded containers connected by apertures of width @xmath5 , see figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the first results , theorem [ th3.1 ] and corollary [ cor3.2 ] show that the essential spectrum @xmath6 of the original problem ( which is expected to be non - empty due to the unboundedness of the domain ) has gaps , and the number of them can be made arbitrarily large depending on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "an explanation of this phenomenon can be outlined rather simply using the floquet - bloch theory , though a lot of technicalities will eventually be involved .",
    "namely , if @xmath7 , the domain becomes a disjoint union of infinitely many bounded containers , and the water - wave problem reduces to a problem on a bounded domain ( we call it the limit problem ) , hence it has a discrete spectrum consisting of an increasing sequence of eigenvalues @xmath8 . on the other hand , for @xmath9 , one can use the gelfand transform to render the original problem into another bounded domain problem depending on the additional parameter @xmath10 . for each fixed @xmath11",
    "this problem again has a sequence of eigenvalues @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , by results of @xcite , @xcite , theorem 3.4.6 , and @xcite , theorem 2.1 , the essential spectrum @xmath6 of the problem  equals @xmath13 where the sets @xmath14 are subintervals of the positive real axis , or bands of the spectrum .",
    "( for the use of this so called bloch spectrum in other problems , see for example @xcite , or @xcite . ) in general , those bands may overlap making @xmath6 connected , but in theorem [ th3.1 ] we obtain asymptotic estimates for the lower and upper endpoints of @xmath14 : we show that @xmath15 for all @xmath16 and @xmath11 and for some constants @xmath17 . in view of this implies the existence of a spectral gap between @xmath14 and @xmath18 for small @xmath19 and @xmath16 such that @xmath20 .",
    "however , since the estimates depend also on @xmath16 , we can only open a gap for finitely many @xmath16 , though the number of gaps tends to infinity as @xmath1 .    the asymptotic position ( as @xmath1 ) of the gaps",
    "is determined more accurately in theorems [ th4.5 ] and [ cor4.6 ] : those main results state that @xmath21 where the numbers @xmath22 depend linearly on the three dimensional capacity of the set @xmath23 .",
    "this result also ensures that in case @xmath24 the bands @xmath14 do not degenerate into single points , which means that the spectrum of the original problem indeed has a genuine band - gap structure .",
    "facts concerning the numbers @xmath25 , @xmath26 are discussed after theorem [ cor4.6 ] .    as for the structure of this paper ,",
    "we recall in section [ sec:1.2 ] the exact formulation of the linear water - wave problem , its variational formulation as well as the parameter dependent problem arising from the gelfand transform , and the limit problem .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] contains the formal asymptotic analysis which relates the spectral properties of the original problem with the limit problem and which is rigorously justified in secion [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the main results , theorems [ th3.1 ] , [ th4.5 ] and [ cor4.6 ] as well as corollary [ cor3.2 ] are also given in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the proofs are based on the max - min principle and construction of suitable test functions adjusted to the geometric characteristics of the domains under study .",
    "the authors want to thank prof .",
    "sergey a. nazarov for many discussions on the topic of this work .",
    "let us proceed with the exact formulation of the problem .",
    "we consider an infinite periodic channel @xmath4 ( see ) , consisting of water containers connected by small apertures of diameter @xmath3 .",
    "the coordinates of the points in the channel are denoted by @xmath27 , and @xmath28 stands for the projection of @xmath29 to the plane @xmath30 .",
    "we choose the coordinate system in such a way that the axis of the channel is in @xmath31-direction and the free surface is in the plane @xmath32 .",
    "we describe the geometric assumptions on the periodicity cell in detail , as well as some related technical tools including the cut - off funcions .",
    "let us denote by @xmath33 a domain with a lipschitz boundary and compact closure such that its intersections with @xmath30- and @xmath34-planes are simply connected planar domains with positive area and contain the points @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37 , respectively ; these points are fixed throughout the paper .",
    "then the periodicity cell and its translates are defined by setting ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) @xmath38 furthermore , we assume that the set @xmath39 is a bounded planar domain containing the origin @xmath40 and that the boundary @xmath41 is at least @xmath42-smooth .",
    "we assume that @xmath23 is so small that the set @xmath43 is contained in @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we define the apertures between the container walls as the sets @xmath46 it is plain that @xmath47 for @xmath48 for all @xmath49 , by the choice of @xmath50 .",
    "we shall need at several places a cut - off function @xmath51 which is equal to one in a neighbourhood of the set @xmath52 and vanishes outside another compact neighbourhood of @xmath52 .",
    "more precisely , we require that @xmath53 ( this is possible by the specifications made on @xmath23 ) and @xmath54 vanishes , if @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath57 , when @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , denoting @xmath59 , it follows from the above specifications that @xmath60 , if @xmath61 ; in particular @xmath62 vanishes on the free water surface @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we shall need the scaled cut - off functions @xmath64 it is plain that also @xmath65 vanishes on @xmath63 for @xmath49 and that @xmath66 for @xmath48 , @xmath67 .",
    "the periodic water channel is defined by @xmath68 and it will be the main object of our investigation . the free surface of the channel is denoted by @xmath69 , and the wall and bottom part of the boundary is @xmath70 .",

    "the spectral problem ( [ problem])([b - cond ] ) can be transformed into a family of spectral problems in the periodicity cell using the gelfand transform .",
    "we briefly recall its definition : @xmath106 where @xmath107 on the left while @xmath108 and @xmath109 on the right .",
