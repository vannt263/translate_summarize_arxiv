    "this is probably the case here as well .",
    "the direction of the flow at its end and close to the source appear to be the same , thus it might be delineating one period , assuming that the changes are periodic , e.g.  caused by a companion star . assuming a typical tangential flow velocity of about 200km / s , the distance from the source to the outermost part of the flow ( 1.8pc ) translates to a period of about 9000yr .",
    "if we assume that the wiggle of the jet is simply caused by periodic changes of the source position in a binary orbit ( see e.g.  fendt & zinnecker 1998 ) , this period would imply a separation of the binary components of order 1000au or a few arcsec at the distance to orion .",
    "however , the apparent widening of both outflow lobes with distance from the source and the large amplitude of the wiggles can not be explained by simply shifting around the outflow source in any reasonable binary orbit , and rather suggest a precessing outflow than just a moving source .",
    "a precessing jet would be caused by a precessing disk , which would be expected in a binary system with non - coplanar disk and orbital planes .",
    "following the arguments given by terquem et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , a precession period of 9000years implies a binary separation ( very roughly ) on the order 10 to 100au , corresponding to angular separations of the order 0.1 arcsec in orion .",
    "it should be possible to resolve separations of a few arcsec or a few tenths of an arcsec with existing or future instruments in the mid - infrared and millimetre wavelength ranges , allowing a test of the above assumptions .",
    "alternatively , we may simply see a poorly collimated outflow , possibly also responsible for exciting the faint features to the west of and , with the brighter h@xmath2 features only imitating a bending flow , or illuminating particular parts of a large outflow cavity . in this respect",
    "it is also interesting to note that the luminosity of the driving source is rather high ( @xmath27 , compared to @xmath28 in ) , possibly suggesting that may be an intermediate - mass young stellar object .",
    "the outflow may thus give further support to the suggestion that flows from intermediate- and high - mass protostars might be systematically less well collimated than those from their low - mass counterparts , as is seen e.g. in ( davis & smith 1996 ) , ( shepherd et al .",
    "1998 ) , the molecular outflow in the core ( shepherd et al.1997 ) , and ( mccaughrean & dent , in prep . ) .",
    "note however that davis et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that flows from high mass protostars may nevertheless be driven by collimated jets like their low mass counterparts .",
    "the driving source of the outflow appears to be = .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of this source is suggestive of a class0 type object ( @xmath2990 , see fig .",
    "[ sedl1641s3mms ] ) , although its detection at the shorter iras wavelengths and its association with a small near - infrared nebulosity suggests that it may be approaching the classi stage .",
    "using data from our wide - field infrared imaging search for h@xmath2 jets in the molecular cloud , we have demonstrated that parsec - scale jets can be found at infrared wavelengths . in particular ,",
    "the previously known features , , and are found to be connected by several newly discovered h@xmath2 features into one large flow . a second large flow is found to consist of the previously known co outflow and the redshifted lobe of the co outflow containing .",
    "again , the full extent of this flow is revealed by infrared imaging . in both cases",
    ", we also found deeply embedded millimetre continuum sources which we suggest to be class0 protostars driving the flows .",
    "finally , we have shown that the southern lobe of the flow , which is traced by h@xmath2 emission , may extend over at least 4pc , i.e.  over a similar length as the northern lobe , which is traced by optically visible hh - objects .",
    "we suggest that the known molecular outflow lobe ( originally thought to be driven by ) is connected to this giant flow .    besides the three flows discussed in this paper , other giant flows are known in .",
    "in addition to the prototype system ( bally & devine 1994 ; eislffel & mundt 1997 ; devine et al .",
    "1997 ) , the system probably belongs to this class of objects ( ogura 1995 ) .",
    "some flows in the region also seem to extend over large distances , including the flow ( reipurth et al .",
    "1997 ) and the h@xmath2 flow j of yu et al .",
    "evidence for further large - scale flows from the cluster is reported by reipurth et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and mader et al .",
    "the discovery of so many giant flows in a single cloud appears to indicate that giant flows are not exceptionally rare systems , but may indeed be more the rule than previously thought .",
    "the redshifted lobes of the and the flows are both seen to be associated with substantial amounts of relatively slow moving molecular gas as traced by the co emission over most of their length .",
    "the molecular gas has probably been entrained more or less in situ , not at the base of the flows .",
    "this implies that both flows plough through the dense gas of the cloud itself , not through the rather thin medium around the cloud like most of the optically - visible giant hh flows .",
    "thus the flows from these two protostars alone are seen to affect a significant volume of the cloud .",
    "this gives additional support to the idea that flows from young low mass stars may play an important role in the dynamical evolution of a cloud and for the regulation of star formation , not only on small scales ( disruption of the cloud cores associated with the protostar driving the flow ) , but also on large scales ( injection of momentum , excitation of turbulence , stabilisation of the cloud against collapse ) .",
    "however , a more complete discussion of that point is deferred to a future paper based on the complete h@xmath2 survey for protostellar jets in orion .",
    "the sources of the two newly recognized giant flows , and , are both deeply embedded , bright at 1.3 mm , very red at iras wavelengths , and qualify as class0 protostars ; only one of them ( ) appears to be associated with a small , faint near - infrared nebulosity .",
    "similar behaviour is found for most of the orion parsec - scale flows , implying that the most pronounced large - scale herbig - haro and h@xmath2 flows are driven by very young objects , typically infrared classi and even class0 type objects .",
    "thus the largest and presumably most energetic outflows are associated with the youngest objects , not the more evolved objects like optically - visible ttauri stars .    many thanks are due to frank bertoldi , ernst kreysa , karl menten , frdrique motte , bernd weferling , and robert zylka for their help during the pico veleta observing run and first aid in reducing the 1.3 mm data .",
    "thanks are also due to the referee , chris davis , for his comments which helped to strengthen some points .",
