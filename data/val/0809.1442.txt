    "this formalism has been extended to massless quarks  @xcite and supersymmetric theories  @xcite .",
    "while recursive methods  @xcite tend to lead to more compact analytical expressions and better numerical performance  @xcite , the csw rules have been useful in several respects such as one - loop calculations in supersymmetric  @xcite and non - supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite and the investigation of multiple collinear and soft limits in qcd  @xcite .",
    "since the csw rules were originally motivated by arguments from twistor - string theory  @xcite , they were thought to be limited mainly to massless particles , although extensions to currents with single color - neutral external massive particles , i.e. electroweak gauge bosons  @xcite or higgs bosons  @xcite , have been found .",
    "however , both for phenomenological and theoretical reasons it is interesting to explore how far these rules can be extended to massive , colored particles , for instance massive quarks such as the top quark .",
    "meanwhile several field theoretical derivations of the csw rules independent of twistor strings have been given  @xcite .",
    "particular interesting for the extension towards massive particles are derivations of the csw rules based on field redefinitions in the framework of light - cone gauge yang - mills  @xcite or the lift of the yang - mills action to twistor space  @xcite .",
    "both of these action - based methods have been used to construct csw rules for a propagating massive , colored scalar @xmath1  @xcite . in this derivation the same field redefinition that results in the csw rules for massless scalars was applied for a massive scalar . as a result",
    "the transformation of the scalar mass - term gives rise to a tower of vertices with only positive helicity gluons @xmath2 while the remaining vertices are identical to those of massless scalars  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the vertex   involves only ` holomorphic ' spinor - products and therefore allows a twistor - space interpretation of scattering amplitudes with massive scalars  @xcite that is not obvious from the explicit results of on - shell scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the new vertex   for massive scalars is proportional to the mass suggests the possibility of constructing a systematic expansion of scattering amplitudes in the mass .",
    "the leading term was discussed in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the csw rules have been used  @xcite to simplify the proof of on - shell recursion relations for massive scalars  @xcite .    in this paper the approach of  @xcite is extended to massive quarks , using the same field redefinitions obtained recently in the derivation of csw rules for massless quarks  @xcite .",
    "the csw vertices for massive quarks derived in this paper are related to the massive scalar vertex   by the same relations implied by the application of supersymmetric ward identities  ( susy - wis )  @xcite to scattering amplitudes with massive quarks and scalars  @xcite .",
    "a similar approach to csw rules for massive quarks was proposed in  @xcite where a complication related to the external polarization spinors of massive quarks was encountered . as a result , scattering amplitudes for massive quarks with a given helicity had to be obtained by adding different amplitudes of the fields appearing in the lagrangian . in the present paper",
    "it is shown how to avoid these complications by an appropriate choice of the quantization axis of the massive - quark spin .",
    "the rules are also shown to generalize to amplitudes with several quark flavors of different masses .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . as the canonical transformation method proposed in  @xcite",
    "is based on the light - cone gauge , section  [ sec : light - cone ] reviews the light - cone treatment of massive quarks , slightly generalizing the treatment given in  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that an appropriate choice of external spinors can be used to arrive at a one - to - one relation between the dynamical degrees of freedom present in the light - cone gauge lagrangian and the external spin - states , avoiding the complication encountered in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting feynman rules are shown to be equivalent to those obtained earlier in a diagrammatic approach  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : derive ] derives the csw vertices for massive quarks and discusses some features of the resulting diagrammatics , after summarizing the field redefinitions  @xcite utilized in the derivation .",
    "some examples for the application of the rules are given in section  [ sec : applications ] , together with a discussion of the structure of all - multiplicity amplitudes with a pair of massive quarks and an arbitrary number of positive helicity gluons and one negative helicity gluon .",
    "finally the extension of the rules to amplitudes with several quark - flavors of different masses is discussed .",
