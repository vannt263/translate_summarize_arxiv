    "the inflationary mechanism is still the most popular alternative to solve the main problems of the standard cosmology : the flatness , homogeneity , horizon and isotropy problems . but this mechanism is not the only one .",
    "the ekpyrotic mechanism manages to solve these problems by means of a previous phase of contraction before the current phase of expansion ( see @xcite for a review ) . in this slow contraction phase ,",
    "the universe is dominated by a stiff fluid with a determined equation of state ( eos ) : @xmath0 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are pressure and energy density , respectively ) . with this fluid ,",
    "the universe became flat , homogeneous and isotropic before the expansion phase , and the seeds of the structure formation were generated during this contraction phase .",
    "these seeds , generated by quantum fluctuations , are nearly scale - invariant and are in agreement with the latest data @xcite",
    ".    among the researches of the ekpyrotic universe , there exists the belief that this mechanism solves the problems of the standard cosmology as well as avoids the problems of the inflationary paradigm @xcite . according to these researches , the inflationary mechanism has two important problems : the initial conditions and multiverse - unpredictability . on the other hand",
    ", the ekpyrotic cosmology does not have both problems andwith the aid of other ingredients , for example , the galileon cosmology and ghost condensate @xcitemanages to avoid another issue in standard cosmology : the problem of the initial singularity . as we can see , the ekpyrotic cosmology offers us an interesting option to the inflation .",
    "moreover , the ekpyrotic cosmology may be extended to a cyclic cosmology . in this cyclic scenario @xcite ,",
    "one has a endless sequence where the universe expands and contracts .",
    "there is no beginning for the timetherefore , the problem of initial conditions is solved in this extended version .",
    "the ekpyrotic mechanism is able to remove debris generated in a previous cycle , such as black holes ( bhs ) .",
    "thus the existence of such a mechanism is crucial to build cyclic cosmologies .",
    "any modern scientific cosmology has the isotropy as a feature . from the beginning of the modernity",
    ", the cosmology assumes that there is no favourite place or direction in the universe ( contrary to both the plato s cosmology in his _ timaeus _ and the aristotle s view in _ on the heavens _ ) .",
    "the physics , from this time , describes the universe as isotropic at large scales .",
    "hence , the current scientific cosmology , an einsteinian cosmology , is assumed to be isotropic .    in this work , by using a determined approach , we intend to show that bhs supported by an isotropic fluid exclude an eos given by the ekpyrotic phase . from the mechanism developed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and generalized in @xcite , we study , using the schwarzschild metric as ansatz , the family of deformed bhs with spherical symmetry supported by an isotropic fluid obtained in @xcite .",
    "we point out that these solutions are forbidden when supported by a stiff fluid ( @xmath3 )",
    ". this result may be interpreted as an indirect indication of the ekpyrotic phase as a period that removes inhomogeneities , anisotropies and debris of a previous cosmic phase in cyclic cosmologies that use the ekpyrotic mechanism .",
    "the structure of this paper is presented in the following : in section 2 we presented the ekpyrotic mechanism and its main features ; in section 3 we show the solutions , supported by a isotropic fluid , constructed by means of deformations in the schwarzschild solution ; in section 4 , the final remarks .",
    "we adopt the metric signature @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the newtonian constant , and @xmath7 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "such as the standard big bang cosmology , the ekpyrotic cosmology assumes a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric as a solution of the gravitational field equations to describe the spacetime fabric . in the first version @xcite , a brane world model was used .",
    "but , some years later , a four - dimensional version , an effective model , was introduced in @xcite . assuming the flrw metric @xmath8,\\label{frlw}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the scale factor , which depends on the cosmic time @xmath10",
    ", @xmath11 determines the spatial curvature ( @xmath12 flat universe ; @xmath13 open universe ; @xmath14 closed universe ) , and the cosmic matter - energy content is described by a perfect fluid @xmath15 , the generalized friedmann equation reads @xmath16 with @xmath17 , where dot represents a derivative w.r.t .",
    "time @xmath10 ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 mean the energy densities of non - relativistic matter ( including dark matter ) and radiation , respectively .",
    "the term which depends on the @xmath20 indicates the energy density of anisotropies .",
    "lastly , @xmath21 denotes the energy density of the scalar field that generates the ekpyrotic phase  interpreted as a perfect fluid in the friedmann equation .",
    "such a field has the action @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the metric determinant , and an eos written as @xmath24 typically , the potential is given by @xmath25 , with @xmath26 and @xmath7 playing the role of constants .",
    "a very steep potential of this type produces an eos for the ekpyrotic phase with a dominant fluid given by @xmath27 .",
    "such a matter content is dominant in eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) during a contraction phase ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) .",
    "the term that describes the anisotropies , @xmath30 is not dominant over the last term in eq .",
    "( [ friedmann ] ) .",
    "then , the slow contraction phase , where the stiff fluid is dominant over other matter contents , produces a homogeneous and isotropic universe , free of the belinsky - khalatnikov - lifshitz ( bkl ) instabilities , before the current expansion phase .",
    "the authors in @xcite have shown that the ekpyrotic mechanism works even when the initial conditions of this slow contraction phase are highly inhomogeneous and anisotropic .    however , the standard ekpyrotic mechanism with one scalar field is considered tachyonically unstable ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to solve this problem , another scalar field",
    "is introduced to generate a stable mechanism with nearly scale - invariant perturbations and small non - gaussianity @xcite .    in the next section",
    ", we will show how to build bh solutions supported by an isotropic fluid . to obtain these bhs , the approach which deforms bhs will be presented .",
    "contrary to the work @xcite , in this work , we do not study the initial conditions of the ekpyrotic phase and its evolution . in this article , we assume an isotropic fluid ( as a linear constraint in the deformation approach ) and show that an ekpyrotic phase does not support these deformed bhs .",
    "that is , an isotropic universe with eos @xmath3 , or an ekpyrotic phase where the universe is already isotropic ( close to the bounce ) , does not support the deformed geometries .",
    "the novel part of this work is the use of the deformation approach to show these results .",
    "it is possible to build isotropic bh solutions by means of deformations . from the standard singular solutions , such as schwarzschild ,",
    "reissner - nordstrm , schwarzschild-(a)-ds and others @xcite , and regular solutions @xcite , at linear level , deformed bhs are obtained by imposing a linear constraint in the energy - momentum tensor ( the approach was generalized in @xcite , where other constraints were used ) .",
    "these deformed solutions are close to the standards bhs .",
