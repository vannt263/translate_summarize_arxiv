    "phase - space representations of quantum mechanics play an increasingly important role in several branches of physics , including quantum optics and atomic physics .",
    "the principal reason for this is the conceptual possibility these representations give for viewing the position and momentum characteristics of a quantum state in the same picture .",
    "phase space is often useful for the description of stationary states , and it has become a natural background for describing the quantum - mechanical time evolution of wavepackets , for both matter waves and electromagnetic waves .",
    "several phase - space representations have been discussed in the literature , but one of them  the so - called weyl - wigner representation  has come to play the role of a canonical phase - space representation , because of its simplicity @xcite . in accordance with this , we shall exclusively consider the weyl - wigner representation in the following .",
    "we consider this phase - space representation to be a representation in its own right . in previous work",
    "@xcite we have justified this statement by analyzing and solving the phase - space differential equations that the wigner functions must satisfy . in particular , we have stressed that the wigner functions may be determined directly from these equations , without reference to wavefunctions ",
    "although it is in general easier to determine them from the wavefunctions .",
    "the fact that the phase - space description is a representation in its own right makes it relevant to apply physical intuition to the form and behavior of the wigner functions , just as physical intuition may be applied to the form and behavior of wavefunctions .",
    "when we do this , we discover that our understanding of quantum states becomes enlarged , because the two types of intuition may work differently and therefore supplement each other .    in the present investigation",
    "which , for the sake of generality , is carried out in @xmath0 dimensions , we consider quantum states referred to a center @xmath1 .",
    "we focus , in particular , on the evaluation of the angular momentum and the kinetic energy of such states . in the familiar picture based on wavefunctions ,",
    "these quantities are calculated as the expectation values of operators . in the phase - space picture",
    "they are calculated by taking averages of dynamical phase - space functions with wigner distribution functions .",
    "performing the two calculations with care will , of course , lead to the same result . yet",
    ", a comparison between the detailed features of the two descriptions leads to some interesting and physically important observations .",
    "this was already noted in our previous work on the wigner function for the ground state of the hydrogen atom @xcite , in which we touched on a pedagogical dilemma which , for instance , has bothered writers of elementary textbooks @xcite : how does one bring the fact that the angular momentum in the bohr orbit is non - zero into accordance with the fact that the angular momentum in the schrdinger picture is zero ?",
    "we referred to this dilemma as the _ angular - momentum dilemma _ and showed that it could be resolved by noting that the mapping of the operator @xmath2 to phase space produces the phase - space function @xmath3 rather than just @xmath4 .    in the following ,",
    "we generalize this result to @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "in addition , we derive parallel but more faceted relations for kinetic - energy quantities , likewise in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we discuss these results and show that the separation of kinetic energy into a radial and an angular part may be done in two physically meaningful ways .",
    "one is suggested by the form of the operators in the wave - function picture , the other by classical - like dynamical functions in the phase - space picture .",
    "the relation between the two variants of radial and angular kinetic energies is tied to the weyl correspondence rule and is , therefore , well defined .",
    "we illustrate the conceptual difference between the two types of kinetic - energy separation by two important examples in three dimensions .",
    "one is the simplest possible time - dependent state of a free particle , the other is the stationary ground state of the hydrogen atom . for the first example , we find that the phase - space induced separation of the kinetic energy into a radial and an angular part depends on time in an intuitively simple way , whereas the operator - based separation is independent of time .",
    "for the ground state of the hydrogen atom , the operator - based separation leads to an angular kinetic energy of zero , whereas the phase - space induced separation classifies the whole kinetic energy as angular kinetic energy .",
    "this striking difference between the results of the two types of separation is well reflected in the form of the wavefunction versus the form of the wigner function .",
    "it illustrates in a perfect way how the physical richness that is hidden in the simplest state of the simplest atom can only be seen by looking at the state from different angles .",
    "it also illustrates the intricate way in which the roots of classical mechanics are buried in the quantum - mechanical soil .",
    "the paper , which is intended to be reasonably self contained , is organized in the following way : in sec .  [ hc ]",
    "we give a brief overview of hyperspherical coordinates and the central - field form of wavefunctions in @xmath0 dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ amke ] we define the angular momentum and perform the operator - based separation of the kinetic energy into a radial and an angular part .",

    ", one writes @xmath22 , where the @xmath23 s are @xmath0 functions of @xmath24 angular coordinates .",
    "both the angles and the @xmath23 s may be chosen in different ways , but a choice similar to the following one is generally used , albeit with varying notation for the angles : @xmath25 with ( @xmath26 ) , ( @xmath27 ) , ( @xmath28 ) ,  , ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "a similar representation may , of course , be set up for the vector @xmath30 in momentum space .",
    "for the volume element in position space we have the expression @xmath31 where the solid - angle element @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 integrating over all angles gives the total solid angle : @xmath34    wavefunctions of the central - field problem are conveniently referred to basis functions of the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a collective notation for the angular coordinates @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a hyperspherical harmonic .",
    "the hyperspherical harmonics were introduced and extensively studied by green @xcite and hill @xcite .",
    "they have also been much studied by later authors .",
    "( see , in particular , the comprehensive presentations by sommerfeld @xcite , louck @xcite and avery @xcite . )",
    "the hyperspherical harmonics are eigenfunctions of the operator @xmath2 which represents the square of the total angular momentum and is defined below .",
    "the angular - momentum tensor in @xmath0 dimensions is defined by the operators @xmath39 the square of the total angular momentum is @xmath40 where the prime indicates that the double sum excludes terms for which @xmath41 .",
    "the angular - momentum operators are independent of @xmath11 .",
    "they merely depend upon the angular coordinates .",
    "we shall now separate the kinetic - energy operator @xmath42 into two distinctive parts . to accomplish this in a manner that eases the subsequent transition to the phase - space representation , we begin by decomposing the @xmath0-dimensional unit matrix @xmath43 as follows : @xmath44 the matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 are defined by the relations @xmath47 and @xmath48 or , @xmath49 and , for instance , @xmath50    adopting a dyadic notation , we may then write @xmath51 next , we note that @xmath52 and @xmath53 hence , the kinetic - energy operator may be written @xmath54 where @xmath55 has the form @xmath56 it represents the radial kinetic energy",

    "( [ hs ] ) that the definition of hyperspherical coordinates implies that @xmath63 using this , and the commutation relations between the components of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , turns the expression ( [ ta ] ) into the following forms @xmath66 these are familiar expressions .",
    "let @xmath67 be a normalized position - space wavefunction , @xmath68 further , let @xmath69 be some operator acting on @xmath70 .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath69 in the state @xmath70 is then @xmath71 when @xmath69 is hermitian , @xmath72 is real .",
    "another way to evaluate the expectation value ( [ expect ] ) is by introducing the @xmath73-dimensional @xmath74 phase space , and then use the expression @xmath75 here , @xmath76 is the wigner function corresponding to the wavefunction @xmath67 , and @xmath77 is the dynamical phase - space function corresponding to the operator @xmath69 . for a hermitian operator @xmath77",
    "the wigner function @xmath76 is always real , but may take negative values .",
    "its integral over phase space is , however , always equal to 1 , @xmath78 it has the particle density @xmath79 and the momentum density @xmath80 as marginal densities :    @xmath81    the wigner function is defined as follows @xcite @xmath82 if the operator @xmath69 is of the form @xmath83 , then @xmath77 will be simply @xmath84 .",
    "otherwise , the noncommutativity between @xmath85 and @xmath65 will come into play .",
    "the transformation involved is the weyl transformation @xcite .",

    "similarly , the subscript 2 is used with operators that only act on the second function in the product .",
    "we denote the weyl transform of the operator @xmath94 by @xmath95 .",
    "it is simply given by @xmath96 in analogy with eq .",
    "( [ l2 ] ) we introduce the dynamical phase - space function @xmath97 this function is , however , not the weyl transform of @xmath2 .    to determine the actual weyl transform of @xmath2",
    ", we first determine the weyl transform of the operator @xmath98 .",
    "we do this by invoking the relation ( [ star ] ) , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 both equal to @xmath95 .",
    "it is found that only the three first terms in the expansion of the exponential operator contribute to the result .",
    "the weyl transform of @xmath98 is thus found to be @xmath101 .",
    "we express the result as the mapping @xmath102 from this , we get for the square of the total angular momentum : @xmath103 this is the generalisation of the result for @xmath104 that we gave in the introduction .",
    "hence we have , for a state described by the wavefunction @xmath67 and the wigner function @xmath76 , that @xmath105 to put this and the other relations above into perspective , let us distinguish between two equally well defined angular momenta .",
    "one of these goes naturally with the wavefunction description .",
    "the other goes naturally with the phase - space description . the first angular momentum , which we shall call the @xmath5 ( _ quantum _ ) angular momentum , is defined by the operators @xmath94 and @xmath2 .",
    "the other angular momentum we shall call the @xmath6 ( _ classical - like _ ) angular momentum .",
    "it is defined by the dynamical phase - space functions @xmath95 and @xmath106 .",
    "the two angular momenta are connected by relations like that of eq .",
    "( [ l2qc ] ) , but the kinds of intuition one may attach to them are quite different .",
    "thus , the @xmath5 angular momentum is primarily an algebraic , or group - theoretical concept .",
    "the @xmath94 operators are generators of infinitesimal rotations , and their eigenvalues describe the possible behavior of a given state under rotations .",
    "an @xmath107-state in a three - dimensional world , with its zero - eigenvalue of @xmath2 , is for instance invariant under a rotation about any axis through the origin .",
    "this is what the eigenvalue of @xmath2 tells us .",
    "the position - space wavefunction @xmath67 is independent of angles , and hence it predicts all directions of @xmath64 to be equally probable . if we prefer to describe the state by its momentum - space wavefunction @xmath108 then this wavefunction is independent of angles about the origin of momentum space . hence , all directions of @xmath30 are also equally probable .",
    "but one can not talk about a coupling between the directions of @xmath64 and @xmath30 in this description .",
    "the expression for the @xmath6 angular momentum is , on the other hand , just the classical angular - momentum expression for particle motion relative to the center @xmath1 .",
    "thus , it provides a measure of the relative direction of @xmath64 and @xmath30 with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "this directional correlation , which is not directly apparent from the wavefunction , is manifestly present in the wigner function .",
    "it leads to a non - zero @xmath6 angular momentum even if the @xmath5 angular momentum vanishes .",
    "this is in complete accordance with the general relation ( [ qcang ] ) .",
    "the weyl transform of the kinetic - energy operator @xmath42 given by the expression ( [ t ] ) , is simply @xmath109 to separate it into a classical - like radial part , @xmath110 , and a classical - like angular part , @xmath111 , we note that the resolution of the identity matrix given by eq .",
    "( [ resolve ] ) also holds in phase space .",
    "hence , we may also write @xmath112 but now the components of @xmath30 commute with the components of @xmath64 , and the analogue of eq .  ( [ tab ] ) becomes @xmath113 with @xmath106 given by eq .",
    "( [ lambda2 ] ) .",
    "the phase - space version of the radial kinetic energy is consequently @xmath114 the last expression is obtained by putting @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the angle between @xmath64 and @xmath30 .",
    "the angular kinetic energy is @xmath117 the validity of the last expression is simplest verified by noting that @xmath118 .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath110 is not the weyl transform of @xmath55 , nor is @xmath111 the weyl transform of @xmath57 . to determine the actual weyl transforms of @xmath55 and @xmath57 requires repeated applications of the relation ( [ star ] ) to the expressions ( [ ta ] ) and ( [ tb ] ) .",
    "we find , after some tedious algebra : @xmath119 and @xmath120    the relation ( [ mapta ] ) between the radial kinetic energies might also have been obtained from the relation ( [ ta2 ] ) by exploiting the following interesting relations : @xmath121 and @xmath122 where @xmath59 is the operator defined by eq .",
    "( [ pr ] ) .",
    "these relations may again be derived by repeated application of the expression ( [ star ] ) for the star product .",
    "we shall now apply the results of this and the previous section to two important examples .",
    "in this section we consider a minimum - uncertainty state in three dimensions .",
    "the wavefunction for such a state is @xmath123 at a chosen initial time @xmath124 .",
    "the corresponding wigner function has the form @xmath125    let us write down the wigner function at a later time @xmath126 under the assumption that we are dealing with a free particle .",
    "we then know that the wigner function will evolve in time in exactly the same way as a classical phase - space distribution , that is , it will develop according to the classical liouville equation @xcite .",
    "thus , the expression for @xmath127 may be obtained from that for @xmath128 by simply replacing @xmath64 by @xmath129 . in this way",
    "we get @xmath130 where @xmath131 since @xmath132 , where @xmath116 is the angle between the vectors @xmath64 and @xmath30 , the wigner function ( [ w3at ] ) only depends on the three coordinates @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath116 .",
    "it is independent of the three euler angles that determine the orientation of the @xmath74 cross in phase space .",
    "this independence of the euler angles expresses the overall rotational invariance of the state , that is , it signifies that the @xmath5 angular momentum is zero at all times .",
    "however , evaluating the average of @xmath106 with the wigner functions ( [ w3a0 ] ) and ( [ w3at ] ) gives @xmath133 , as it should according to the relation ( [ qcang ] ) .",
    "we note that all angles between @xmath64 and @xmath30 are equally probable at @xmath124 , whereas small values of @xmath116 are favored for large values of @xmath126 .",
    "thus , the correlation between @xmath64 and @xmath30 depends on @xmath126 .",
    "such a statement would be impossible to defend in the wavefunction picture .",
    "however , in the phase - space picture it is very meaningful .",
    "for at @xmath124 , the wigner function ( [ w3at ] ) is concentrated about the origin of phase space .",
    "but in the course of time , phase space points with non - zero values of @xmath13 will move to points with larger values of @xmath11 , with @xmath64 and @xmath30 becoming more and more parallel .",
    "but this just amounts to small values of @xmath116 being favored for large values of @xmath126 , as in the expression ( [ w3at ] ) .",
    "this behavior is also reflected in the expectation values of the radial and angular parts of the kinetic energy as a function of time , but only in the phase - space picture .",
    "it is readily verified that the total kinetic energy associated with the wavefunction ( [ psi3a0 ] ) has the value @xmath134 it is , of course , independent of @xmath126 . and",
    "since @xmath135 represents an @xmath107 state , the expectation value of the @xmath57 of eq .",
    "( [ tb ] ) is zero at all times .",
    "thus we have : @xmath136 for all @xmath126 .    in the phase - space picture",
    ", we must average the dynamical phase - space functions @xmath137 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 with the phase - space function([w3at ] ) .",
    "we denote the resulting energies by @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively : @xmath141 @xmath142 and @xmath143 we have , of course , that @xmath144    rather than evaluating the expressions ( [ t3rad ] ) and ( [ t3ang ] ) by direct integration , we may proceed in the following analytical way : according to eqs .",
    "( [ mapta ] ) and ( [ maptb ] ) , with @xmath104 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the weyl transforms of the operators @xmath145 and @xmath146 respectively .",
    "hence , we merely have to modify the values in ( [ tcab ] ) with the expectation value of @xmath147 to get the values of @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "evaluating this value by averaging @xmath147 with the wigner function ( [ w3at ] ) gives @xmath148 hence , we get @xmath149 thus , the classical - like kinetic energy is purely radial for very large values of @xmath126 .",
    "however , at @xmath124 only one third of the kinetic energy is radial , corresponding to the value @xmath150 .",
    "the angular kinetic energy is twice as large .",
    "this reflects the fact that @xmath64 and @xmath30 are entirely uncorrelated at @xmath124 , so that @xmath30 is twice as likely to be perpendicular to @xmath64 as being parallel to @xmath64 .",
    "the energies @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , as functions of @xmath126 .",
    "having studied a free - particle case , we shall next consider a bound - state case , namely , the ground state of the three - dimensional hydrogen atom . the wavefunction is now @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the bohr radius , @xmath153 @xmath18 is the electron mass ( we treat the nucleus as being infinitely heavy ) , and @xmath154 is the magnitude of the elementary charge .",
    "the state considered is a stationary state , and the wigner function is accordingly independent of time . as in the previous example",
    ", we are dealing with an @xmath107 state , so the wigner function is again independent of the euler angles that determine the orientation of the @xmath74 cross , but it does depend on the angle @xmath116 between @xmath64 and @xmath30 , and in fact in a more complicated manner than in the expression ( [ w3at ] ) . in addition , the wigner function for the hydrogen atom takes both positive and negative values , whereas the wigner function ( [ w3at ] ) is non - negative at all times .",
    "we have made a detailed study of the wigner function for the hydrogen atom in @xcite .",
    "our results were , _",
    "inter alia _ , presented as a series of contour maps for different @xmath116 values .",
    "these maps showed that the wigner function is everywhere positive in what we called the dominant subspace , that is , the part of phase space in which @xmath64 and @xmath30 are perpendicular ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "it is , in particular , large in the part of this subspace obtained by putting @xmath156 and @xmath157 .",
    "this is the region of phase space to which the ground - state motion was restricted in early quantum mechanics @xcite , since a bohr orbit ( in position space ) is just a circle with radius @xmath152 , in which the electron is supposed to move with the constant momentum @xmath158 . for other angles than @xmath155 ,",
    "the wigner function develops negative regions .",
    "it is , in particular , strongly oscillating around the value zero for small angles and angles approaching @xmath159 .",
    "we shall now see that this pronounced correlation between the directions of @xmath64 and @xmath30 is strongly reflected in the partitioning of the kinetic energy .",
    "the kinetic energy associated with the wavefunction ( [ psih ] ) has the value @xmath160 and since @xmath67 represents an @xmath107 state we have , in analogy with the expressions ( [ tcab ] ) : @xmath161 the relations ( [ taa ] ) and ( [ tbb ] ) still hold , and it is readily found that @xmath162 the analogue of ( [ caltab ] ) becomes therefore @xmath163    this is a remarkable result .",
    "for it shows that , in the phase - space representation , the radial kinetic energy vanishes .",
    "the kinetic energy is purely angular .",
    "this is of course in complete harmony with a picture in which the electron primarily revolves around the nucleus rather than moving in the radial direction .",
    "the cases studied in this section and the previous one have both been for @xmath107 states .",
    "the expressions we have derived in the first six sections are , however , valid for any state independent of its angular momentum , but the interesting effects are most pronounced for the @xmath107 states . with a minor exception , the derived expressions are also valid for any dimension @xmath0 . a few comments concerning dimensions different from three are , therefore , in order .",
    "the minor exception mentioned above has to do with zero - angular - momentum states for @xmath164 .",
    "the relations ( [ mapta ] ) and ( [ maptb ] ) suggest that the separation of the kinetic energy into a radial part and an angular part is invariant under the weyl transformation for @xmath164 .",
    "this is , however , not quite true",
    ". one must be aware that taking expectation values with the expressions ( [ mapta ] ) and ( [ maptb ] ) involves taking expectation values of @xmath165 , and such expectation values are undefined for wavefunctions that stay finite at @xmath166 in a two - dimensional world .",
    "this is because the volume element ( [ dv ] ) only contains @xmath11 to the first power for @xmath164 .",
    "hence , one can not exploit operator relations like those of eqs .",
    "( [ taa ] ) and ( [ tbb ] ) for zero - angular - momentum states .",
    "this , however , does not reduce the significance of the dynamical phase - space functions @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "it just implies that the radial and angular kinetic energies @xmath139 and @xmath140 associated with them must be evaluated directly by averaging with the wigner function , using the two - dimensional version of the expressions ( [ t3rad ] ) and ( [ t3ang ] ) .",
    "for the two - dimensional equivalent of the wigner function ( [ w3at ] ) this produces a @xmath126 dependence of the kinetic energies similar to that in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with the difference that the kinetic energy is equally distributed on its radial and angular components at @xmath124 .",
    "this difference was to be expected since there is only one perpendicular direction to @xmath64 in two dimensions .    concerning the hydrogen atom , it is interesting to note that the above conclusions for the ground state of the hydrogen atom in three dimensions remain valid for other values of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , the kinetic energy is purely radial in the wavefunction picture , but purely angular in the phase - space picture .",
    "the ground - state wavefunction for the @xmath0 dimensional hydrogen atom has the general form @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the total solid angle ( [ sd ] ) and @xmath169 the ground - state kinetic energy is @xmath170 and for @xmath171 exactly the same value is found for the expectation value of the @xmath0 dependent term in ( [ mapta ] ) and ( [ maptb ] ) .",
    "this confirms that the classical - like kinetic energy is , in fact , purely angular for @xmath171 .    for @xmath164 , we can again not draw on expressions like those of eqs .",

    "doing so shows that also for @xmath164 , the classical - like kinetic energy is purely angular .",
    "the said integrations over phase space are far from simple to perform , because the wigner function for the hydrogen atom can not be evaluated analytically @xcite .",

    "this suggests that only for the coulomb potential is the classical - like kinetic energy purely angular .",
    "the linear combinations of gaussians used to prepare fig .  [ fig2 ] were determined by the variational principle , following the prescription given in reference @xcite . in that work",
    ", we made explicit studies of the wigner function for the @xmath0 dimensional hydrogen atom and presented contour curves for selected values of @xmath0 .",
    "these contour maps show , _ inter alia _",
    ", that the oscillations between negative and positive values of the wigner function become weaker and weaker for higher @xmath0 values .",
    "we may therefore say that the phase - space distributions become more classical as the dimensionality @xmath0 increase .",
    "the problem of separating the kinetic energy of a particle moving in a central field into a radial part and an angular part has not attracted much attention in the past .",
    "it has been tacitly assumed that the separation offered by the wavefunction picture was the only sensible one . in the present paper",
    "we have challenged this view by putting focus upon the separation offered by the phase - space picture .",
    "this separation is equally well defined .",
    "in contrast to the former , it throws much light on the correlation between the directions of the position vector @xmath64 and the momentum vector @xmath30 .",
    "there is no way of discussing this correlation in the wavefunction picture .",
    "the most amazing result of our analysis is probably our finding that the kinetic energy in the ground state of the hydrogen atom is purely radial in the wavefunction picture , and purely angular in the phase - space picture .",
    "this finding , which relates to arbitrary dimensions , reflects the great difference in the kind of intuition one may apply within the two pictures .",
    "this difference is also well illustrated by focusing upon the angular momentum . in the wavefunction picture",
    ", the angular momentum primarily refers to the behavior of the state under rotations . in the phase - space picture",
    "it also refers to the correlation between the directions of @xmath64 and @xmath30 .    to properly understand a quantum system one must look at it from different angles .",
    "the present paper shows once again that the phase - space picture is a fruitful supplement to the wavefunction picture .",
