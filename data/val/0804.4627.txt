    "the first investigations of the coherent population trapping ( cpt ) effect were performed theoretically and experimentally in the seventies @xcite . in accordance with these early works , the cpt effect is due to a coherence between ground states caused by the interaction with a quasi resonant , two - frequency and coherent light field .",
    "cpt and related effects ( such as electromagnetically induced transparency @xcite and absorption @xcite ) have an impact on both , the atomic system state and the light beam propagation through the media .",
    "cpt resonances with a narrow linewidth can be recorded in the simplest case in quantum systems with two long - lived ground states and one excited state coupled by a dichromatic coherent light field . in this configuration",
    "the quantum system is prepared in a non absorbing state ( the dark state ) .",
    "the energy levels in such a configuration are arranged similar to the greek letter @xmath3 ( so called @xmath3-system ) and can be found , for instance , in alkali atoms . in the experiment",
    "cpt resonances are recorded by varying the frequency difference of two spectral electromagnetic field components around the value of the frequency splitting of the ground states .",
    "the properties of the cpt resonances can be exploited in a wide range of applications such as atomic magnetometry @xcite , atomic frequency standards @xcite , pulse delaying and compression for optical memory @xcite .",
    "the problem in the use of cpt effect in those applications is its low strength : often the dark state induces only a small variation in the light trasmitted throught the atomic sample . to overcome this limitation",
    "recently several novel light - atom interaction schemes were proposed @xcite . in particular in work @xcite the authors show that a significant enhancement of the cpt effect can be obtained in the so - called lin@xmath2lin cpt configuration . here two co - propagating linearly polarized laser waves with parallel linear polarization vectors are resonant with the transitions to @xmath4p@xmath5 f@xmath6 of the @xmath0rb isotope .",
    "a detailed analysis of the two - photon @xmath3 transition process shows that in a lin@xmath2lin cpt configuration the cpt resonance depends critically on the excited state hyperfine structure ( hfs ) @xcite , in a way different to that of the well known cpt resonance obtained by a circularly polarized laser field @xcite . in the case of circularly and linearly polarized laser field",
    "the dark state arise from a vectorial ( @xmath7=0 ) and quadrupolar coupling ( @xmath7=2 ) , respectively .",
    "a theoretical study of four - level system describing the cpt resonance depending on the structure of the ground and excited atomic levels has been published in @xcite .",
    "the interest of these systems relies to the possibility of controlling its optical properties via the quantum interference arising between two dark states , for instance , by means of the phases of the laser fields @xcite or the local phase of the dark states @xcite . in the present work we study the behavior of the lin@xmath2lin cpt resonance occurring within the manifold of the hyperfine transitions of the @xmath0rb d@xmath1 line . in our case",
    "the cpt resonance depends on the structure of the excited hyperfine states and it is described in detail in section [ sec : model ] with the model developed for the data interpretation .",
    "we analyze the lin@xmath2lin cpt resonances as a function of the laser detuning and the homogeneous broadening ( in section [ sec : result1 ] ) , which depends on the pressure broadening ( due to the buffer gas in the cell ) and the laser linewidth .",
    "note that the evaluation of the laser linewidth influence on the dark states is crucial for applications and has not been investigated much so far . a theoretical study of the laser linewidth effects on cpt resonance for achieving selective excitation of atoms ( with application in laser cooling and quantum computing ) is presented in reference @xcite ; while in @xcite the author has demonstrated with his model a scheme that allows large time delay for large bandwidth optical pulse .",
    "we perform our studies with two different light sources : a pair of phase - locked ( pl ) extended cavity diode lasers ( ecdls ) and a current modulated vertical cavity surface emitting diode laser ( vcsel ) .",
    "the pl - ecdls have , in good approximation , pure dichromatic fields with a narrow linewidth . on the contrary",
    ", the modulated vcsel has a multi - frequency spectrum with broader linewidth .",
    "a detailed discussion of the laser sources and the experimental setup is presented in section [ sec : setup ] .      in the last years",
    "many efforts has been steered into the realization of compact cpt - based atomic clocks @xcite .",
    "the cpt excitation scheme usually used is based on the interaction of cs or rb atoms with a circularly polarized laser field , i.e. either @xmath9 or @xmath10 transitions are induced by the two frequency components of the driving laser field ( in the following called @xmath11-@xmath11 cpt ) . a typical excitation scheme in case of the manifold of hyperfine transitions within the @xmath0rb d@xmath1 ( the same case we will discuss for the lin@xmath8lin configuration ) is illustrated in figure [ fig : sigma - sigma - cpt ] . here",
    ", a weak magnetic field of few tens of @xmath12 t oriented in laser propagation direction , is applied to lift the degeneracy of the zeeman sublevels . in this configuration",
    "the resonance used as reference in frequency standard applications is the coherent superposition of the sublevels @xmath13 and @xmath14 being in first order not sensitive to magnetic fields .",
    "the problem of this interaction scheme relies on the fact that the state @xmath15 is not involved in the excitation process . as a consequence ,",
    "the optical pumping effect caused by the isotropic spontaneous decay of the excited states accumulates the population into this _ idle state _ which , thus , represents a loss mechanism for the clock reference resonance .",
    "this leads ( especially at higher laser intensities and low buffer gas pressure ) to a reduced signal / noise ratio because most of state population is concentrated in those zeeman sublevels with highest ( lowest ) @xmath16 quantum numbers .    on the contrary , in case of a lin@xmath8lin cpt configuration ( discussed in section [ sec : model ] ) no idle states are present and the state population is concentrated symmetrically around the zeeman sublevel with quantum number @xmath17 .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively because there is no transfer of net angular momentum from the linear polarized light to the atoms in the excitation process .",
    "thus a better signal - to - noise ratio is expected especially in the case of higher laser intensities and low buffer gas pressures .",
    "this characteristic makes the lin@xmath8lin cpt resonance a valid candidate for high performance compact atomic clock ( a detailed study is presented in @xcite ) .",
    "a model based on the density matrix approach has been used for the data interpretation and has been described in detail in reference @xcite . here",
    "we report on the basic approach and we give an intuitive picture of the results essential for our discussion .",

    "the gas cell becomes optically thick .",
    "the consequence is that the density matrix elements ( and with them the dark states ) are functions of the light intensity along the optical path .",
    "modeling of such a coupled behavior is rather complicated because , strictly speaking , the effects of propagation determined by the maxwell equations are strongly coupled with the density matrix equations of the quantum system .",
    "our experiments are performed with an optically thick @xmath0rb vapor cell .",
    "therefore in the model the optical path is divided in a set of subsequent parts .",
    "assuming constant electrical fields ( @xmath38 ) in each thin layer the density matrix is calculated .",
    "finally the maxwell equations for the slowly varying e - field amplitude and phase @xcite , are used to calculate the variations of the e - fields within the layer .",
    "thereafter the density matrix of the next layer is determined by using the new e - field derived from the previous layer .",
    "this procedure is repeated for all subsequent parts . in the numerical calculations we do nt take into account modifications of the transverse intensity distribution .",
    "nevertheless , this simple phenomenological approach allows us to reproduce the experimental results ( see section [ sec : result1 ] ) . in the following the ground and excited state zeeman sublevels",
    "are called @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath39 and @xmath40 belong to different hyperfine ground states and a dark state can be created when the two transitions , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , are excited simultaneously .",
    "if the laser field intensity is much lower than the saturation limit for each optical transition and the cell is optically thin , the total excited state population @xmath33 is proportional to the light power absorbed ( c.f . equation [ eq2a ] ) .",

    "the excitation of this transition by a laser light field of linewidth @xmath64 , results in an homogeneous broadened profile that can be described with a lorentzian curve of linewidth @xmath49 ( figure [ fig : hombrod ] ) .",

    "if different @xmath73 transitions are excited , g@xmath70 characterizes the contribution of each transition to the total excitation process .",
    "now we extend the previous consideration made for a single optical transition to a dark state .",
    "the necessary condition for creating the dark state is that the transitions from both ground states @xmath74 and @xmath75 towards the same excited level @xmath76 are simultaneously excited by two coherent electromagnetic field components , i.e. the relative frequency jitter of the electromagnetic field components is negligible .",
    "this condition is fulfilled either in the vcsel and in the pl - ecdls ( see section [ sec : setup ] ) .",

    "since the light fields are both co - propagating the doppler broadening of the cpt resonance is due to the @xmath150 ghz difference frequency .",
    "note , that - in the case of a buffer gas cell - the micro - wave doppler effect is strongly reduced by the dicke narrowing @xcite because the atoms are confined within a volume much smaller than the @xmath151 cm wavelength corresponding to the @xmath150 ghz frequency . at a temperature of @xmath152c",

    "is measured for a laser detuning @xmath188 ( transitions towards f@xmath6 ) and @xmath189 mhz ( transitions towards f@xmath91 ) respectively .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite the cpt resonance arising from the group of transitions towards f@xmath91 is broader than the one arising from transitions towards f@xmath6 .",
    "but , interestingly , negligible differences in the width @xmath174 are observed for cpt resonances prepared by the pl ecdl system .    to quantify the influence of the each dark state contributing to the cpt resonance , in section [ sec : model ] the coefficients",
    "g@xmath79 have been introduced . in the two upper plots of figure [ fig : avsd ] ,",

    "refers to the un - perturbed group of transitions toward f@xmath6 ( evacuated cell ) ; and the dotted lines represent the maxima of absorption for f@xmath6 ( @xmath191 mhz ) and f@xmath91 ( @xmath192 mhz ) in the cell containing p@xmath177 kpa ( collisional shift is @xmath193 ghz k ( kpa)@xmath194 @xcite ) . for each laser system",
    ", we observe that a@xmath185 shows two relative maxima which are both shifted with respect to the two maxima of absorption in the cell .",
    "in particular the maxima of a@xmath185 coincide with the maximum and the minimum value of @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "note that in general the dark state @xmath195 is affected by the losses due to the one - photon transitions towards to the outermost excited levels @xmath4p@xmath5 f@xmath91 , m@xmath196 ( see figure [ fig : linlin ] ) .",
    "for this reason when @xmath197 the resulting lin@xmath2lin cpt resonance is smaller than the one for @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "the values of a@xmath185 noticeably decrease when the light sources ( pl - ecdls or vcsel ) are tuned between the two group of transitions .",
    "in fact we showed that the dark states prepared via different excited hyperfine sublevels interfere destructively , and , if their involvements into excitation process are equal , i.e. @xmath199 , the cpt resonance vanishes .",
    "similar effect has been discussed in the case of two zeeman sublevels belonging to the same hyperfine manifold in @xcite . moreover , by comparing the left and right part of figure [ fig : avsd ] , we can observe that the a@xmath185 maximum recorded in the experiments using pl - ecdls is larger than the a@xmath185 maximum obtained with the modulated vcsel .",
    "the measured behavior of a@xmath185 vs. @xmath143 is well reproduced by the model calculations .",
    "in particular - at the experimental conditions referring to figure [ fig : avsd ] - the @xmath200 coefficients calculated for pl - ecdls are bigger than these coefficients calculated for the modulated vcsel , either for @xmath112 and @xmath159 .    the behavior of the @xmath11-@xmath11 cpt resonance amplitude , width and position as a function of the laser detuning @xmath143 is studied in a higher pressured buffer gas cell ( @xmath201 kpa of neon ) by the authors in @xcite . as anticipated in section [ intro ]",
    "the dark states obtained by interactions with linearly and circularly polarized are intrinsically different . in the case of",
    "circularly polarized light fields , the dark states arise from a vectorial coupling ( @xmath202 ) and no quantum interference occurs @xcite .",
    "this different nature of the lin@xmath8lin and @xmath11-@xmath11 cpt is shown in figure [ fig : comp ] . here",
    ", the master laser ( determining the laser detuning @xmath143 ) of the pl - ecdls is tuned at the crossover resonance between the transitions : f@xmath203f@xmath79= 1 and f@xmath203f@xmath79= 2 . in case of the lin@xmath8lin",
    "cpt the resonance amplitude @xmath173 is strongly suppressed because both dark states - via the excited states f@xmath79= 1 and f@xmath79= 2 - have equal strengths @xmath139 and interfere destructively ( c.f .",
    "figure [ fig : avsd ] ) . unlike , in case of @xmath11-@xmath11 cpt such a destructive interference is not observable due to the specific phase relation of the rabi frequencies .",
    "the previous results allows us to predict the influence of the homogeneous broadening @xmath49 ( equation [ eq : gammafirst ] ) on the lin@xmath2lin cpt resonance . in practice",
    "we compare the experiments performed with pl - ecdls and modulated vcsel in a selected @xmath0rb cells containing @xmath146 kpa of n@xmath145 for a fixed value of the laser detuning . in this section",
    "we compare the dark state prepared with the two lasers systems in two @xmath0rb cell with different relevant pressure n@xmath145 .",
    "in particular we study the case of detuning @xmath188 , when the master laser of the pl - ecdls is stabilized .",
    "under such conditions a pl - laser linewidth @xmath204 of @xmath205 mhz is achieved , i.e. it is @xmath206 times narrower than the vcsel linewidth ( @xmath164 mhz ) .",
    "figure [ fig : avsi ] shows the cpt resonance amplitude ( a@xmath185 ) versus the resonant laser power for @xmath0rb cells with p@xmath177 kpa and p@xmath207 kpa , figure [ fig : avsi](a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "the main difference between the experiments performed with those cells is the relation of the collisional broadening in each cell and the vcsel linewidth . for p@xmath177 kpa ,",
    "the collisional broadening contribution @xmath208 mhz is smaller than the linewidth of the vcsel ( @xmath209 ) . on the contrary , for p@xmath207",
    "kpa @xmath178 is @xmath210 mhz , i.e. about @xmath159 times of @xmath211 . in both cases",
    ", @xmath178 is much bigger than the pl - laser linewidth ( @xmath212 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : avsi ] ( a ) and ( b ) the solid points refer to the experiments performed with the modulated vcsel and the pl - ecdls , respectively .",
    "the solid lines show the results of the theoretical model ( c.f sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] ) , which are in good quantitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "we observe that the difference in a@xmath185 obtained with the two laser systems is large in ( a ) while it is reduced , and almost negligible , for i@xmath213 mw/@xmath214 , in ( b ) .",
    "to explain the observed behavior we first note that in reference @xcite the authors showed a reduction of the cpt resonance amplitude when the laser linewidth is larger than the pressure broadening for the dark states created via the interaction with circularly polarized laser light .",
    "they explained this results by considering that the dark state is excited in atoms belonging to several velocity classes .",
    "this argument is still valid , of course , in the case of lin@xmath2lin excitation , but can only partially explain our results . in the previous parts of this communication we have demonstrated that in the case of dark state arising from a quadrupolar coupling ( @xmath215 ) the excited state hyperfine structure must be taken into account for each @xmath143 . under quadrupolar coupling conditions",
    "the phase relations of all rabi frequencies , involved within the excitation scheme , plays a major role . using the formalism developed in our model",
    ", we can conclude that for intensities lower than the saturation of the optical transitions , when @xmath216 ( condition satisfied in figure [ fig : avsi ] ( b ) ) , it is possible to obtain the same @xmath190 ratio for the two laser systems .",
    "it is possible , then , to find experimental conditions in which the amplitude of the lin@xmath2lin cpt resonance , a@xmath185 , is independent of the laser linewidth . on the contrary , when @xmath217 ( condition satisfied in figure [ fig : avsi](a ) )",
    ", the laser linewidth plays an important role : the ratio @xmath190 for experiments with the modulated vcsel is smaller than @xmath190 for the pl - ecdls .",
    "we can not appreciate the influence of the laser linewidth in the cpt linewidth ( @xmath218 ) . for both laser sources ,",
    "@xmath218 increases linearly with the laser intensity in the same range of values .",
    "the values of @xmath174 extrapolated to zero laser intensities , are @xmath219 khz and @xmath220 khz for the cell with @xmath146 kpa and @xmath147 kpa buffer gas pressure respectively , mainly caused by collisional broadening effects @xcite .",
    "we present a study the cpt resonance prepared in lin@xmath2lin configuration , focusing our attention to the signal between ground state zeeman sublevels such as m@xmath221 , which is a good candidate for compact and high performance atomic clocks .",
    "this interaction scheme is characterized by quantum interference between dark states prepared through the two excited hyperfine states .",
    "a model is developed taking into account the multi - level structure of the atomic system and the linewidth of the lasers .",
    "we study the signal as a function of the laser detuning , i.e. the excited state hyperfine structure . by comparing the model and the experimental results we can quantify the influence of each dark state on the lin@xmath2lin cpt resonance .",
