    ". the crystal binding energy can be parametrically small , causing it to melt under quantum fluctuations and/or temperature .",

    "the original skyrme model supports this descriptive although it suffers from the inherent shortcomings of the higher order chiral terms at high density  @xcite . the chiral holographic approaches to qcd support the crystal structure in the large number of colors limit without the shortcomings of the skyrme model  @xcite .",
    "the crystal is found to melt at relatively small temperatures by the lindemann criterion , resulting into a holographic liquid of instantons at low density and dyons at higher densities .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to think that the cold and dense inhomogeneous phase gives way to a homogeneous phase under the effects of temperature .    the purpose of this work is to address issues in relation to the dense and hot homogeneous baryonic phase using the ( bottom - up ) holographic approach .",

    "recently , a variant of this construction was suggested in  @xcite whereby the dilaton field is directly tied to the running of the gauge coupling in the yang - mills theory .",
