    "force - free magnetic fields are of great importance to our understanding of many astrophysical plasmas . in the solar corona , for example , where magnetic energy in general dominates over the kinetic , thermal , and gravitational energy , the magnetic field is typically considered to be approximately force free .",
    "a force - free magnetic field @xmath0 satisfies @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the current density . in general @xmath3 , but if @xmath4 is either spatially uniform or zero we distinguish linear - force - free fields or potential fields , respectively .",
    "two magnetic fields on the same domain are said to be _ topologically equivalent _ if one can be obtained from the other by means of a smooth ( continuously differentiable ) deformation .",
    "the topology of a magnetic field in a magnetically closed volume is therefore specified by the orientation and mutual linkage of all field lines .",
    "this encompasses the presence of field nulls ( points at which @xmath5 ) and separator fields lines linking such nulls . during an ideal evolution of the magnetic field ( which includes the evolution of @xmath0 in an ideal plasma ) , this topology is preserved ( for a detailed discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when the volume under consideration is not magnetically closed ",
    "i.e.  when field lines thread the boundaries of the volume  then one must refer to the topology with respect to some external reference field . in this case ,",
    "conservation of the topology requires that the mapping of field lines from one boundary of the domain to another is fixed or follows some ideal evolution of the external field ",
    "in addition to the preservation of field line linkage and numbers of null points .    explaining how the solar corona is heated to temperatures of millions of degrees kelvin above that of the solar surface is a long - standing and fundamental problem in solar physics .",
    "one leading , though still controversial , mechanism is the  topological dissipation \" model put forward by @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the assertion that if one chooses a magnetic field of a given topology , then in most cases no smooth force - free equilibrium corresponding to that topology exists .",
    "therefore the lowest energy state will in general be a force - free field containing tangential discontinuities , i.e.  current sheets .",
    "since the alfv ' en transit time along a loop is much shorter than timescales associated with the convective motions in the photosphere , it is argued that the coronal field evolves through a sequence of ( approximate ) force - free states .",
    "as the boundary driving continually changes the topology of the field , one will inevitably arrive at a topology for which no smooth force - free state exists , leading to the formation of current sheets .",
    "of course in the real coronal plasma the small but finite resistivity means that the truly discontinuous state is never reached , but once length scales are sufficiently small the current will be dissipated , accompanied by magnetic reconnection and a change of topology .",
    "one reason that the topological dissipation mechanism has stimulated",
    "so much debate is that so far no - one has been able to construct a general proof for or against it .",
    "many studies have tackled different aspects of the problem using both theoretical and numerical techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a series of recent studies have attempted to place the hypothesis on a firmer theoretical footing by considering ",
    "topologically untwisted \" force - free fields @xcite  which according to the authors definition equate with potential fields in the case of a closed , bounded , simply - connected domain .",
    "in particular , @xcite ( hereafter referred to as jl09 ) considered the compression or expansion of a magnetic field that is initially potential and is line - tied between two perfectly conducting plates . the normal component of the field is taken to be non - zero only on these two line - tied plates , and the system is perturbed by moving the two line - tied boundaries either closer to or further from one another .",
    "jl09 argue that since the field is topologically untwisted , and since no twist has been applied via the boundary perturbation , then the field must remain topologically untwisted , i.e.  it must remain potential .",
    "they go on to present specific examples where they calculate the new potential field in the compressed ( or expanded ) volume and demonstrate that its topology is not the same as that of the initial field .",
    "thus , they argue , if a relaxation ensues in which the topology is preserved , current sheets must form .",
    "we note that this type of finite - amplitude compression is rather different from the original parker mechanism , which invoked only random , small - amplitude footpoint motions tangential to the line - tied boundaries . in the study of jl09 ,",
    "the choice of a compression of the volume was simply a method envisaged by the authors to generate a domain and magnetic topology that are inconsistent with the existence of a smooth equilibrium .",
    "it is worth noting that the formation of current singularities in response to the compression of a force - free field was also considered by @xcite .",
    "however , they considered a scenario in which the magnetic field was one - dimensional , and of infinite extent , being tangential to the perfectly conducting boundaries .",
    "there have been two criticisms made of the jl09 argument .",
    "first , @xcite presented a specific counter - example in which the magnetic field , once compressed , did not lead to a potential field with current sheets , but rather to a smooth force - free field with non - zero current .",
    "this they demonstrated in the linear regime by using an expansion scheme , and also numerically in the non - linear regime .",
    "however , @xcite have pointed out that this example does not contradict their theory , since the magnetic field considered by @xcite is two - dimensional , being unbounded in the invariant direction .",
    "@xcite have also raised an objection against the argument of jl09 .",
    "they consider the same geometry as jl09 , and assert that one step in the jl09 argument is flawed . in particular , they draw attention to the fact that the assumption that the compressed magnetic field must remain topologically untwisted is based on an intuitive rather than a firm theoretical basis . indeed , they argue that the field must not remain potential ( topologically untwisted ) , but must develop large - scale finite currents .    in this study , we use a direct approach to investigate the question as to whether current singularities form during an ideal relaxation .",
    "we take a given potential magnetic field over a closed 3d domain as initial condition , deform the domain by compressing / expanding it by some chosen factor , and then numerically relax the magnetic field towards a state with @xmath6 .",
    "we then analyse the properties of the magnetic field and current density obtained in the final state of the relaxation .",
    "in one particular example , we take as an initial condition the magnetic field without null points discussed by jl09 .",
    "we describe the numerical method in section [ method ] , then present our results in section [ results ] and a discussion in section [ discuss ] .",
    "we use a 3d lagrangian relaxation scheme ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which takes advantage of the fact that , due to the frozen - in field condition , the evolution of the vector field @xmath7 is described by exactly the same equation as the evolution of the line element @xmath8 joining two lagrangian fluid particles ( @xmath0 is the magnetic field and @xmath9 the mass density ) .",
    "specifically , @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the material derivative and @xmath12 the plasma velocity .",
    "since we are only interested in the final equilibrium configuration , and not in the evolution to it , we determine the relaxed state using a fictitious damping force .",
    "specifically , the evolution of the locations ( @xmath13 ) of the fluid particles  which are used as grid points in our lagrangian approach  is determined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimensionless current density .",
    "this is equivalent to neglecting inertial effects and introducing a frictional force into the momentum equation , where the coefficient of friction is set to 1 .",
    "such a choice has the advantage of eliminating the wave properties of the plasma while guaranteeing a monotonic decay of the total energy .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the path taken in the relaxation affects neither the final equilibrium attained nor its stability properties @xcite .    during the relaxation process",
    ", fluid elements are evolved according to equation ( [ momentum ] ) , while we fix the locations of the fluid elements on all boundaries to impose line - tying of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic flux , magnetic helicity , and @xmath16 are automatically conserved in the relaxation .",
    "thus , if the initial magnetic field satisfies @xmath17 , this will always remain satisfied .",
    "the numerical scheme is implicit and unconditionally stable , meaning that the computational cost of the simulations need not be prohibitive .",
    "the purpose of this study is to search for the formation of tangential discontinuities ",
    "current sheets  in the relaxed field .",
    "while such current sheets can not be explicitly represented on a discrete numerical grid , there are certain signatures that are indicative of the presence of singular structures in the magnetic field represented by the discretisation .",
    "one indication of a potentially singular current layer would be the presence of current structures with thickness down to the grid scale .",
    "in addition , we expect that local quantities such as the current density may diverge with increasing numerical resolution at certain points in the domain . by contrast",
    ", the integrated current should remain constant as the resolution is varied , since this may be determined by a line integral ( via amp ` ere s law ) over a circuit far from the current buildup . on the basis of a one - dimensional analysis it is expected that the divergence of the current density with increasing resolution should take the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is of order unity and @xmath20 is the numerical resolution which defines the initial grid spacing according to @xmath21 @xcite . in particular , for a one - dimensional collapse with a lagrangian mesh @xcite showed that one expects a power - law exponent @xmath22 . such a power - law scaling has also been observed for more complex singular structures in 2d and 3d in previous studies employing a lagrangian approach @xcite , for which typically @xmath23 .",
    "we first consider the three - dimensional potential magnetic field without null points discussed by jl09 ( see section 3.5.1 of their paper ) . this magnetic field is defined in cylindrical polar",
    "coordinates @xmath24 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the first root of the derivative of the 1st - order bessel function @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "the authors consider this field over the domain @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "all field lines enter the volume at @xmath31 and exit at @xmath32 , and are assumed to be line - tied at these two planes .",
    "since the numerical method we use is based on a cartesian geometry , we consider this field , before any deformation , over the domain @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "we focus in what follows on the behaviour within @xmath35 .",
    "it has been checked that the influence of the side boundaries does not affect the behaviour of the system within this region , as discussed below .",
    "we then compress / expand the domain in the @xmath36-direction in a linear fashion to disturb the magnetic field from equilibrium , before beginning the relaxation .",
    "below we present results based on a compression by factor 1.25 such that the field is contained within @xmath37 .",
    "however , we have repeated the relaxation both for expansions , and for compressions up to a factor of 6.67 ( such that @xmath38 ) and obtained qualitatively the same results .",
    "( for stronger compressions the relaxation scheme does not converge and so no conclusions can be drawn . )    at @xmath39 the peak value of the lorentz force @xmath40 in the domain is around 1.15 .",
    "we run the relaxation scheme as described above until this peak value falls below some threshold , here chosen to be @xmath41 ( at which point @xmath42 and @xmath43 )",
    ". this value can be further decreased , but the qualitative results of the study remain the same .",

    "the very small differences observed progressively decrease as we increase the grid resolution of our simulations .",
    "we now consider an initial magnetic field that shares many properties with that described in section [ janseexsec ] above , but which contains a magnetic null point .",
    "we construct this potential field by superimposing onto a uniform background field a magnetic point source  the point source is located outside the numerical domain so that the field within the domain is still physically plausible .",

    "note that we do not use the potential field with a null presented by jl09 .",
    "their field is more difficult to study with our numerical method since the field does not thread the top of the box , meaning that @xmath69 is much stronger near the base , and in addition the null is located very close to the base .",
    "we consider the magnetic field defined above to be more closely analogous to the fields without nulls presented in section [ nonullsec ] , in that the field threads both @xmath36-boundaries .",

    "this leads to a peak lorentz force in the domain with value around 5 .",
    "we then run the relaxation scheme until such time as @xmath74 everywhere in the domain , and take the resulting field as the relaxed state .",
    "in contrast to the field without nulls , there are clear signatures of current sheets in the relaxed state .",
    "first , a thin layer of intense current is found to form with thickness on the grid scale .",
    "this current layer is focussed at the null point , and spreads along the separatrix surface , as shown in figure [ jnull ] .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite who investigated the perturbation of a simple linear null point magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the local structure around the null is very similar ( see the inset of figure [ jnull](a ) ) , in that a local collapse of the spine and fan towards one another forms a current sheet centred on the null , with the current vector directed locally perpendicular to the plane of collapse @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the current density within the sheet is found to diverge as the numerical resolution @xmath44 is increased . in figure [ scalenull ]",
    "we plot the peak current ( found in the vicinity of the null ) and the integrated current through the @xmath75 plane .",
    "it is clear that while the integrated current approaches a constant value , the peak current shows a power law dependence on @xmath44 , consistent with the presence of an underlying singularity .",
    "the dashed line in figure [ scalenull ] indicates a scaling relation @xmath76 , which is in line with the results of @xcite who considered only a linear null point field .",
    "we speculate that the minor departures from the exact power law scaling for the peak current stem from the null being located at different proximities to the nearest grid point for different values of @xmath44 .",
    "plane ( circles ) as a function of the numerical resolution @xmath44 , for the relaxed state of the field containing a null point ( eq .",
    "( [ nulleq ] ) ) .",
    "the dashed line has a gradient of 1.33 . ]",
    "the results presented above clearly demonstrate that the formation of current sheets in response to the compression ( or expansion ) of a potential magnetic field is by no means a certainty .",
    "when the field contains one or more null points and associated separatrix surfaces , then current sheets are likely to form .",
    "this is because the lowest energy state for the compressed ( expanded ) field will in general have different quantities of magnetic flux within different ` topological domains ' ( whose boundaries are the separatrices ) , while during the ideal evolution a transfer of flux between these domains is prohibited . there are no such restrictions in the absence of nulls , and our results suggest that in general a force - free field with a finite but spatially - distributed current is accessible under an ideal relaxation .",
    "indeed , @xcite has proven that in the absence of null points , force - free fields do exist in the vicinity of the potential field , i.e.  for sufficiently small @xmath4 ( though the proof does not provide any numerical estimate for how small @xmath4 should be ) .",
    "we note that the finite - amplitude compression of a magnetic field in the manner described herein is rather different to the original mechanism of spontaneous current sheet formation put forward by parker to explain solar coronal heating . in the study of jl09 ,",
    "the choice of a compression of the domain was simply a method to generate a domain and magnetic topology that are inconsistent with the existence of a smooth equilibrium .",
    "however , we have shown that in the absence of null points , no such inconsistency arises .",
    "the reason for the breakdown of the argument made by jl09 has been discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "in particular , the assumption made by jl09 , based on intuitive arguments , that a topologically untwisted magnetic field must be potential , is shown to be incorrect .",
    "we have demonstrated that the resolution of the change of connectivity seen by jl09 is not that space - filling current sheets form in the relaxed state , but that a large spatially - diffuse current develops .",
    "we have in addition applied our relaxation technique to the magnetic field presented by @xcite  which also contains no null points .",
    "again , large - scale diffuse current concentrations were observed in the relaxed state , confirming their analysis .",
    "we note that the present implementation of the relaxation negates the objections regarding this counter - example put forward by @xcite , who asserted that the field did not conform to the geometry considered in their theory based on the fact that it had infinite extent in the invariant direction .",
    "however , here we enclosed the field in a finite box ( line - tied on all boundaries , such that during the relaxation the field becomes fully three - dimensional ) , and have obtained a smooth solution for the relaxed magnetic field that shows good agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the conditions under which singular current sheets form during the ideal relaxation of a magnetic field remain unknown .",
    "what we have demonstrated here is that , in general , the simple compression or expansion of a potential magnetic field without null points does not lead to a lowest energy state containing singular current sheets .",
    "it is likely that there are certain potential magnetic fields that contain no null points or separatrices but that would develop tangential discontinuities when perturbed , for example by a compression , and then ideally relaxed .",
    "it would be a major theoretical breakthrough to understand what additional properties of the magnetic field are required for this to occur .",

    "it should be noted that numerical roundoff errors can in principal mean that the value obtained by the numerical method for the level of the @xmath77 force does not always provide an accurate measure of the proximity of the field to force - free equilibrium .",
    "the error in the evaluation of @xmath77 tends to build as the grid deformation becomes stronger , as discussed by @xcite .",
