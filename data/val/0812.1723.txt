    "@xcite moreover , a sign change of the exciton @xmath0-factor is very desirable in quantum information processing and thus there is a strong interest in quantum dots having a zero @xmath0-factor due to the structure of the dot . to investigate the size , shape and composition dependence of the electron , hole and exciton @xmath0-factor , theoretical investigations using the * k@xmath2p * approximation @xcite as well as tight binding calculations",

    "the self - assembly process of quantum dots gives rise to a distribution in size , shape and composition of the dots and therefore leads to a dot to dot variation of @xmath1 .",
    "this opens the possibility to utilize the growth conditions to engineer @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite however , up to now experiments on inas / gaas qds did not reveal a strong correlation between emission energy and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    we have performed photoluminescence ( pl ) measurements on a large number of single inas / inp quantum dots in order to investigate the energy dependence of @xmath1 and its dependence on the structural properties of individual quantum dots . in this paper we will demonstrate strong correlations between @xmath1 , the diamagnetic shift and the emission energy of the inas / inp quantum dots . eventually , the size dependence of @xmath1 will lead to a sign change of @xmath1 .",
    "the observed correlations can be explained well by the theoretical trends discussed in ref . .",
    "furthermore , we will analyse the anisotropy splitting of these dots and correlate this to the height and lateral size of the dots . as the pl of the inas / inp quantum dots is tunable to 1.55@xmath3 m @xcite ,",
    "our results show that @xmath0-factor engineering is also feasible at telecommunication wavelengths .",
    "our quantum dots are grown by metal - organic vapor - phase epitaxy ( movpe ) .",
    "a layer of 100 nm of inp has been grown on a @xmath4-doped inp ( 100 ) substrate with a two degrees miscut towards the [ 110 ] direction .",
    "two monolayers ( ml ) of gaas were deposited as an interlayer , thereby reducing the as / p exchange reaction . on top of this interlayer",

    "the quantum dot layer is capped by 200 nm of inp . for atomic force microscopy ( afm ) a layer of surface quantum dots was grown under the same conditions . from the afm measurements we find an average height of the dots of ( 2@xmath51)nm and a dot diameter of ( 34@xmath55)nm .",

    "a multiple peak structure is observed consisting of 9 peaks .",
    "the peak positions at @xmath6k are indicated by the dotted lines .",

    "quantum dots having the smallest height have luminescence around peak p1.,width=330 ]    the sample is characterized by temperature dependent pl measurements performed on a large ensemble of dots .",
    "the quantum dots are excited by a laser operating at 532 nm and with a spot size of @xmath74mm@xmath8 .",
    "the macro pl is detected by an ingaas array detector up to 1550 nm and with an insb single channel detector above 1400 nm .",

    "these spectra are plotted by matching at 1450 nm the spectra obtained by both detectors . instead of a single gaussian distribution , characteristic for highly homogeneous quantum dots , a series of peaks ( p1-p9 ) is observed .",
    "the spectrum at @xmath6k displays strong similarities with the ones reported in refs . and",
    "; the peaks were identified as quantum dots with discrete height differences of 1 ml and the dots were modeled accordingly . in the same way we attribute the different peaks to a multimodal height distribution of our dots .",
    "quantum dots emitting around p9 at the low energy side of the spectrum have the largest height , whereas dots emitting at the high energy side have the smallest height .",
    "the width of the peaks is due to the dot to dot variation of the diameter and composition .",

    "the height was measured and the resulting distribution is shown in fig . [ figure2](c ) .",
    "the quantum dots best resemble circular discs , as depicted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure2](a ) , and therefore the height of the dot is independent of where the dot is cleaved .",
    "the height distribution shows that we have quantum dots with heights varying between 5 and 15ml , which matches quite well with the 9 peaks we observe in the macro pl .",
    "a height of 5ml would then correspond to dots belonging to macro pl peak p1 .",
    "moreover , most dots have a height between 7 - 9ml corresponding to the part of the pl spectrum which is most intense ( p3-p5 ) .",

    "@xcite the gaas interlayer is not located between the inas dot and the inp substrate , but the inas dots are rather embedded in the gaas layer . although the gaas layer suppresses the as / p exchange reaction , the actual role of this layer in the growth of these dots is still a matter of further investigation .",
    "there appears to be no strong intermixing of ga and p inside the quantum dot and therefore we conclude that our dots consist of almost pure inas . for all the studied dots comparable compositions are found .",

    "@xcite the reduced strain in inas / inp quantum dots relative to inas / gaas quantum dots reduces the splitting of the heavy - hole and light - hole band edges in the dot , and thus there is more light - hole character in the highest - energy hole state of an inas / inp quantum dot than in that of an inas / gaas quantum dot . as the light - hole @xmath0-factor is less negative than the heavy - hole @xmath0-factor , this effect leads to less negative @xmath24 s in inas / inp dots than in inas / gaas dots .",
    "smaller dots also have smaller light - hole character in the highest - energy hole state , due to the differing effects of confinement on the heavy and light hole energies , and thus smaller quantum dots have more negative @xmath24 s than larger quantum dots , as seen in the measured @xmath1 trend .",

    "[ figure7](b ) , dots having a smaller height , i.e. larger @xmath13 , have in general a larger anisotropy splitting .",
    "we believe this is due to the fact that for quantum dots of lower height the exciton wave functions are more squeezed in the lateral directions",
