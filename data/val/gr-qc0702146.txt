    "the ligo - geo - virgo - tama network of broadband ground - based laser interferometers , aimed at detecting gravitational waves in the high - frequency band @xmath0@xmath1 hz , is already operating at or near its initial design sensitivities . in the next decade , lisa ( the laser interferometer space antenna ) will open up the low - frequency gravitational - wave window ( @xmath20.1 hz ) .    among the most important sources of gravitational waves for lisa are extreme - mass - ratio inspirals ( emris ) , which are systems in which a small object ( with mass @xmath3 ) orbits a supermassive black hole or other central body ( boson star @xcite@xcite or soliton star @xcite or naked singularity or ... ) with mass @xmath4 .",
    "recently , brown and collaborators @xcite have estimated that advanced detectors in ligo ( the laser interferometric gravitational - wave observatory ) may detect up to @xmath5 _ intermediate mass ratio inspirals _ ( imris ) , which are analogous to emris but have less massive central bodies ( masses @xmath6 in the range of @xmath7 ) .",
    "thorne has conjectured that the waves from an emri or imri contain , encoded in themselves ( at least in principle ) : ( i ) the spacetime geometry ( metric ) of the massive central body , ( ii ) the tidal coupling ( evolving rate of energy and angular momentum exchange ) between the orbiting object and the central body , and ( iii ) the evolving orbital elements . this conjecture ( which has been partially proved ;",
    "see below ) has motivated placing emris high on lisa s list of target sources @xcite , and has motivated research to : ( a ) prove thorne s conjecture with the widest generality possible , or , if it is false , determine what information actually _ is _ encoded in the emri and imri waves @xcite@xcite ; ( b ) develop data analysis techniques for searching for emri and imri waves in lisa @xcite@xcite and ligo @xcite data ; ( c ) scope out the accuracy with which lisa and ligo can extract the encoded information from emri and imri waves ( and if the central body appears to be a black hole , the accuracy with which its properties agree with those of a hole )  @xcite@xcite ; and ( d ) develop data analysis techniques for extracting the waves information @xcite .",
    "fintan ryan @xcite has proved a theorem that is an important step toward verifying thorne s conjecture .",
    "specifically , he has proved that it is possible in principle to recover the full spacetime geometry from emri waves under the following assumptions : i ) the central body is general - relativistic , stationary , axisymmetric , reflection - symmetric , and asymptotically - flat ( sarsaf ) , ii ) the small object travels on a nearly circular and nearly equatorial orbit , and iii ) there is no tidal coupling .",
    "moreover , ryan has shown that the multipole moments that determine the spacetime geometry are _ redundantly _ encoded in the gravitational waves and can be extracted using _ either _ of the two precession frequencies ( about a circular orbit and about the equatorial plane ) _ or _ the waves phase evolution .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize ryan s theorem .",
    "we retain assumptions ( i ) and ( ii ) ( sarsaf spacetime and nearly circular , nearly equatorial orbit ) but relax assumption ( iii ) by allowing for a small amount of tidal coupling .",
    "we show that in this case , thorne s conjecture is nearly correct : the waves encode not only the central body s metric but also the evolving orbital elements and ( in a sense slightly different from thorne s conjecture ) the evolving tidal coupling .",
    "( assumption ( ii ) , that the orbit is nearly circular and nearly equatorial , is relaxed in a companion paper by li @xcite ) .",
    "motivated by the result of fang and lovelace @xcite that the only unambiguous part of the tidal coupling is the time - dependent , dissipative portion ( at least when the central body is a non - spinning black hole and the orbit is large and circular ) , we characterize the tidal coupling by the rates of energy and angular momentum exchange between the central body and the orbiting object , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "one can still use ryan s algorithm for the precession frequencies to recover the central body s spacetime geometry .",
    "then , by making use of the observed ( time - independent ) spacetime geometry and the measured , evolving amplitudes associated with the precession frequencies , one can also recover from the emri waves the evolving orbital parameters . having relied on non - dissipative aspects of the waves to deduce the spacetime geometry and orbit",
    ", one can then  as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : tidalcoupling]use the waves dissipation - induced phase evolution to deduce the tidal coupling .    in our somewhat delicate discussion of deducing the tidal coupling ( sec .",
    "[ sec : tidalcoupling ] ) , we begin by noting that the sum of the power radiated to infinity and the power fed into the central body via tidal coupling , @xmath13 is equal to the power lost from the orbit , which can be deduced from the waves observed phase evolution .",
    "the central body influences this observed @xmath14 in two ways : ( i ) by generating a nonzero @xmath15 , the quantity that interests us , and ( ii ) by very slightly altering @xmath16 . to help quantify these two body influences , in sec .",

    "this measured / deduced body influence on the total energy loss consists of two tiny pieces : the power that actually goes into the body via tidal coupling , @xmath15 , and the body s tiny influence on the power radiated to infinity , @xmath19 : @xmath20    in principle ( as described above ) , from the observational data plus general - relativity theory we know the body s influence on the total energy loss @xmath21 with complete precision .",

    "_ we let a small object with mass @xmath38 move about the central body in a nearly circular , nearly equatorial orbit .    for precisely circular , equatorial , geodesic motion , the waves obviously have a single fundamental frequency @xmath39 that is associated with the circular motion @xmath40 .",
    "when the geodesic orbit is slightly nonradial , it is easy to show that its radius @xmath31 undergoes periodic motion with some angular frequency @xmath41 ; and when slightly nonequatorial , its vertical coordinate @xmath42 undergoes periodic motion with another angular frequency @xmath43 .",
    "these geodesic motions give rise to gravitational waves that are triperiodic : a discrete spectrum with frequencies equal to @xmath39 , @xmath41 , @xmath43 , and their sums and differences ( see ref .",

    "the frequency difference @xmath44 shows up as an orbital periapsis precession , and @xmath45 as an orbital plane precession ; these precessions produce corresponding modulations of the gravitational waveforms .",
    "in our case , the orbits are not geodesics ; they evolve due to gravitational radiation reaction .",
    "because of the extreme mass ratio , the radiation reaction can be described by the adiabatic approximation . in this approximation ,",
    "on the timescale of an orbital period , the small object moves very nearly along a geodesic of the central body s gravitational field . on a timescale",
    "much larger than the orbital period , the object moves from one geodesic to another as it loses energy and angular momentum to gravitational radiation .",
    "it follows that the three frequencies @xmath46 each evolve with time on the radiation reaction timescale which is much longer than the orbital periods .    in principle",
    ", a large amount of information can be encoded in the time evolution of the waves three fundamental frequencies @xmath47 and the complex amplitudes ( amplitudes and phases ) of the various spectral components .",
    "the largest amplitudes are likely to be those for the second harmonic of @xmath39 and for the two precessions , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 .",
    "we shall call these the primary - frequency component , and the precessional components of the waves . to simplify our prose , we shall refer to @xmath41 and @xmath43 as the `` precession frequencies '' even though the actual frequencies of precession are @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thorne s conjecture can be expressed mathematically as the claim that these time evolving frequencies and amplitudes encode fully and separably ,    1 .",

    "ryan s theorem  @xcite states that , if there is no tidal coupling , then all the sarsaf moments @xmath57 are encoded in the time evolving frequencies fully , separably , and redundantly .",
    "ryan did not explicitly address the encoding of the three orbital elements @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , their encoding is an almost trivial extension of his analysis :    specifically , ryan noticed that the three fundamental frequencies are independent of @xmath58 and @xmath59 to first order in these small quantities , i.e. , they are functions solely of the moments and the semi - latus rectum @xmath60",

    "we now drop ryan s restriction of no tidal coupling .",
    "this does not alter eqs .   for @xmath41 and @xmath43 as functions of @xmath24 ,",
    "i.e. of the orbital frequency @xmath39 , since all three frequencies only depend on the geodesic motion and hence only depend on the multipole moments @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",
    "the evolution of the frequencies , _ as functions of time , will _",
    "depend on the tidal coupling .",
    "more generally , we can divide the physical quantities of our analysis into two categories : i ) `` static : '' those quantities related to the geodesic motion of the orbiting object , and ii ) `` dynamic : '' those quantities related to the inspiral of the object ( i.e. , to the evolving rate at which the object moves from geodesic to geodesic ) .",
    "all static quantities are independent of tidal coupling and all dynamic quantities depend on it .",
    "this suggests that ryan s analysis can be extended to include tidal coupling .",
    "first , the static quantities can be used to deduce the the central body s multipole moments , just as in ryan s original argument as sketched above .",
    "then , the dynamic quantities , combined with knowledge of the spacetime metric , can be used to extract tidal - coupling information .",
    "this extension is discussed in the following subsections .",
    "following ryan , we characterize the phase evolution of emri waves by the number of primary - frequency cycles of waves per logarithmic frequency interval , as a function of the primary waves slowly increasing frequency @xmath72 .",
    "this quantity can be written as ( eq .  ( 4 ) of ref .",

    "so long as tidal coupling is negligible , then , the spacetime multipole moments can be determined redundantly from _ either _ @xmath74 [ eq .  ( [ dnnbi ] ) ] _ or _ the periapse precession frequency @xmath79 _ or _ the orbital - plane precession frequency @xmath80 [ eqs .",

    "when tidal coupling effects are included , the redundancy is broken .",
    "the multipole moments @xmath81 can still [ eq .  ( [ eq : precessionfreqs ] ) ] be determined from @xmath82 , while ( as the following discussion shows ) , the tidal coupling can be determined from @xmath81 and @xmath74 .    as a preliminary to discussing this ,",
    "we explain why it is sufficient , in analyzing tidal coupling , to focus on energy exchange between the orbit , the body and the waves , and ignore angular momentum exchange .",
    "since the body is in a ( nearly ) circular , geodesic orbit , changes in its orbital energy and angular momentum are related by    @xmath83    aside from second - order corrections due to the slight orbital ellipticity and inclination angle .",
    "our entire analysis is restricted to first - order corrections , so those second - order corrections are negligible .",
    "similarly , since the energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity are carried by the primary waves , with angular frequency @xmath84 ( aside from negligible contributions from the precessions , which are second order in the ellipticity and inclination ) , each graviton carries an energy @xmath85 and an angular momentum @xmath86 ( with this last 2 being the graviton spin ) .",
    "therefore , the energy and angular momentum radiated to infinity are related by @xmath87 conservation of energy and of angular momentum , together with eqs.([eq : elorbit ] ) and ( [ eq : elinfty ] ) , then imply that @xmath88 [ eomegal ]    for the energy and angular momentum deposited in the body by tidal coupling .",

    "the total rate that energy is lost from the orbit ( which then goes to infinity and the body ) is related to the phase evolution @xmath74 by @xmath89 the phase evolution @xmath90 and the primary frequency @xmath91 are known from observation , and , after using the precession frequencies to compute the spacetime metric ( sec .",

    "( [ dotetotal ] ) can be determined from observed quantities , which means that @xmath14 is measurable .",
    "another measurable quantity , we claim , is the rate that energy would be lost from the orbit if the body s structure had no influence .",

    "( [ dotetotal ] ) ] @xmath97 knowing the moments as a function of frequency from measurements of the precessions , @xmath98 can be computed from the moments via ryan s phasing relation past leading order ) . by extending ryan s calculation to higher post - newtonian orders , the terms omitted from eq .",
    "( [ dnnbi ] ) can be written explicitly . ]",
    "( [ dnnbi ] ) , and , as we have seen , @xmath92 can also be computed from the observations ; so @xmath99 is , indeed , observable , as claimed . therefore the influence of the body s structure on the orbit s total energy loss @xmath100 is also observable .",
    "this body influence on the total energy loss consists of two parts : the energy that goes into the body via tidal coupling , @xmath15 , and a tiny body - influenced modification of the rate that the waves carry energy to infinity @xmath101 where @xmath102    thorne conjectured that the energy exchange due to tidal coupling , @xmath15 , would be observable .",
    "we doubt very much that it is , since in general we see no way to determine the relative contributions of @xmath15 and @xmath22 to the observed total body influence @xmath21 .",
    "the best one can do , in general , in validating thorne s conjecture , is to extract the central body s total influence on the orbital energy loss , @xmath21 .",
    "however , in the special case of a body that is exceedingly compact , we can do better , as we shall explain in the next subsection .      consider a central body sufficiently compact that gravity near its surface blue shifts the orbiting object s tidal field , making it appear like ingoing gravitational waves as seen by stationary observers .",
    "this is the case , for example , when the central body is a black hole .",
    "then , we claim , the ratio @xmath104 is very small : @xmath105 where @xmath25 is a large number , very likely 5 . for lisa ,",
    "almost all of the wave cycles used in extracting information from the waves will be from radii where @xmath106 so @xmath107 .",
    "for example , for a kerr black hole , if the spin parameter is @xmath108 , then at the innermost stable circular orbit , @xmath109 .",
    "consequently , almost all of the measured @xmath21 will go into the body itself via tidal coupling , so @xmath15 will be measured to good accuracy .",
    "to understand our claim that @xmath110 for some large @xmath25 , consider a central body whose external metric is that of a kerr black hole . in this case , one can use the teukolsky formalism @xcite ( first - order perturbation theory in the mass ratio @xmath111 ) to compute the energies radiated to infinity and tidally coupled into the central body .",
    "we have carried out that teukolsky analysis for general @xmath112 and present the details for the special case @xmath113 in the appendix . here",
    "we explain the underlying physics .",
    "we begin with some preliminaries :    we need only consider the primary - frequency waves , @xmath114 , since they account for all the energy loss and transfer , up to corrections second order in the eccentricity @xmath58 and inclination angle @xmath59 .",
    "this means , correspondingly , that we can restrict ourselves to a precisely circular and equatorial orbit .",
    "the waves and tidal coupling then have predominantly spheroidal harmonic order @xmath115 and frequency @xmath91 ( angular frequency @xmath116 ) .",
    "since we only want to know , to within factors of order unity , the ratio @xmath117 , it will be sufficient to restrict ourselves to these dominant @xmath118 @xmath119 perturbations .    in the teukolsky formalism",
    ", these perturbations are embodied in a radial `` wave function '' that can be normalized in a variety of different ways .",
    "the usual normalization , based on the newman - penrose field @xmath120 , is bad for physical insight because it treats outgoing waves and ingoing waves quite differently ; see the appendix .",
    "one normalization that treats them on the same footing sets the radial wave function equal to that of the tidal gravitational field ( `` electric - type '' components of the weyl or riemann curvature tensor ) measured by `` zero - angular - momentum '' observers , zamos ( a family of observers , each of whom resides at fixed radius @xmath121 and polar angle @xmath122 ) .",
    "we shall denote that tidal field [ with @xmath123spheroidal harmonic ) factored out so the field is complex , not real ] by @xmath124 .",
    "another , closely related normalization for the radial wave function sets its modulus squared equal to the rate of flow of energy .",
    "we shall denote this choice by @xmath125 . at large radii , @xmath126 , where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the dimensionless gravitational wave fields ; so",
    "the radiated energy is @xmath129 , which tells us that @xmath130 . near the body s surface ( i.e. near where the horizon would be if the body were a kerr black hole ) ,",
    "the energy flux is @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the kerr - metric lapse function , which goes to zero at the horizon radius .",
    "( the zamos divergently large outward speed , relative to infalling observers , causes them to see a divergently large tidal field ; the factor @xmath133 corrects for that divergence ; see , e.g. , the discussion in sec .",
    "vi.c.2 of @xcite . )",
    "thus , in order to ensure that the power flow is the square of the renormalized radial wave function , @xmath134 we must renormalize the zamo - measured tidal field @xmath124 by @xmath135    with these preliminaries finished , we can give our physical argument for eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratiovn ] ) in terms of the radial wave function @xmath125 .",

    "if the central body is a kerr black hole , then the boundary condition on @xmath125 at its surface ( the horizon ) is purely downgoing waves , and at infinity , purely outgoing waves .",
    "the ratio of downgoing power at the horizon to outgoing power at infinity has the standard kerr values @xcite@xcite : @xmath136 if the hole s spin angular velocity @xmath137 is much less than the orbital angular velocity @xmath39 ; and @xmath138 if @xmath139 .",
    "( here we have used the _ no - body - influence _",
    "notation @xmath17 for the outgoing power because a central black hole s internal structure is unable to influence the waves radiated to infinity . )",
    "correspondingly , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : dotepsi ] ) , the ratio of the downgoing field at the horizon @xmath140 to the outgoing field at infinity @xmath141 is @xmath142 this suppression of the downgoing field relative to the outgoing is due , mathematically , to a reflective effective potential in the wave equation that @xmath125 satisfies ( fig .  [ fig : psi ] ) .",
    "physically , it is due to coupling of the field @xmath125 to the central body s spacetime curvature",
    ".    now suppose the central body is not a black hole , but some other object so compact that its surface is well beneath the peak of the effective potential .",
    "this mathematical assumption is equivalent to our physical assumption that the zamos see the downgoing field @xmath140 so strongly blue shifted by the central body s gravity that it looks like radiation . the only way , then , that the central body can influence the energy radiated to infinity is to reflect a portion of this downgoing radiation back upward .",
    "mathematically , this corresponds to replacing the black hole s downgoing boundary condition by @xmath143 at some chosen radius just above the body s surface . here",
    "@xmath140 and @xmath144 are the downgoing and upgoing components of @xmath125 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : psi ] .",
    "for simplicity , we shall assume that the amplitude reflection coefficient @xmath145 is small , @xmath146 .",
    "otherwise we would have to deal with a possible resonant buildup of energy between the reflective central body and the reflective effective potential  though that would not change our final answer ( see , e.g. , the more detailed analysis in the appendix ) .    the upgoing waves @xmath144 have great difficulty getting through the effective potential .",
    "the fraction of the upgoing power that gets transmitted through , successfully , is @xmath147 if the hole rotates slowly , and @xmath148 if rapidly [ eq .  ( 8.83 ) of @xcite with @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "since the fields @xmath125 are the square roots of the powers ( aside from complex phase ) and since @xmath151 , this power transmissivity corresponds to @xmath152    combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : outbioverup ] ) , ( [ eq : upoverdown ] ) , and ( [ eq : downoverout ] ) , we see that @xmath153    if these two complex outgoing fields are not precisely out of phase with each other ( phase difference @xmath154 ) , then the outgoing power is @xmath155 , which means that the ratio of the radiated body - influenced power to radiated no - body - influence power is @xmath156 in the unlikely case ( which we shall ignore ) that the two fields are precisely out of phase , the ratio will be the square of this .    by combining eq .",
    "( [ eq : biovernbiinfinity ] ) with the square of eq .",
    "( [ eq : downoverout ] ) , we obtain the ratio of the body - influence power radiated to infinity over the tidal coupling power into the central body : @xmath157 independent of whether the body rotates slowly or rapidly .",
    "this is the claimed result .    if the central body s external metric is not kerr , then the first - order perturbation equations for the orbiting body s spacetime curvature will probably not be separable in @xmath158 , so the analysis will be much more complex .",
    "nevertheless the physical situation presumably is unchanged in this sense : the body s spacetime curvature will couple to the perturbation field in such a way as to resist energy flow through the region between the body s surface and the object s orbit . correspondingly , the perturbation fields and power flows are very likely to behave in the same manner as for the kerr metric , with the same final result , @xmath159 with @xmath25 very likely still 5 but possibly some other number significantly larger than one .",
    "if this is , indeed , the case , then for any sufficiently compact central body the power tidally deposited into the body @xmath15 will be very nearly equal to @xmath160 , which is measurable ; and therefore the tidal power will be measurable .",
    "in this paper , we have extended ryan s analysis to show that in principle it is possible to recover not only the spacetime geometry of the central body , but also the evolving orbital parameters of the inspiraling object and the evolving tidal coupling between the small object and the central body .",
