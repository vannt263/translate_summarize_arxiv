    "recent advances in self - driving vehicles and advance driver assistance system ( adas ) have attracted keen attention and interest from researchers and automobile manufacturers .",
    "vision sensor plays an important role in these areas due to its faster response , lower price and power consumption compared with other popular sensors such as lidar and millimeter - wave radar .",
    "moreover , vision sensor has the ability to capture rich information from traffic scene ( such as luminance , color and texture )  @xcite , which is beneficial for object detection .",
    "vision - based object detection is one of the fundamental functions for self - driving vehicle systems and advance driver assistance systems ( adas ) , which need to detect the objects around and check whether they are dangerous to the host vehicle .",
    "however , object detection in traffic scene from image are still challenging job . on one hand ,",
    "traffic scenes are diverse and the presence of objects ( e.g. vehicles and pedestrians ) in traffic scenes are extremely flexible and unpredictable . on the one hand ,",
    "most traffic scene applications have several special requirements such as real - time , portable ( e.g. for adas device ) , low price and power consumption , which are quite different from object detection tasks in the ilsvrc  @xcite and coco  @xcite competitions .",
    "recently , a great number of researchers have been interested in learning based approaches . especially in recent years , the success of deep learning boosts the development of vision - based object detection .",
    "convolutional neural network ( cnn )  @xcite is one of the most popular forms of deep networks . by using the strategies of local receptive fields , weight sharing and spatial pooling  @xcite , cnn has made a breakthrough in computer vision and image processing .",
    "for instance , alexnet  @xcite , which is a type of cnn , has made a startling achievement in the competition of ilsvrc-2012  @xcite and demonstrated its superiority in image classification .",
    "however , with the increasing of network depth , cnn has met the bottleneck in training  @xcite . recently , he _ et al . _",
    "proposed the deep residual network  @xcite which employs shortcut connections to overcome the limitations in training a deeper cnns .    despite the fact that cnn has achieve a tremendous success in computer vision and image processing ,",
    "there still exist two main problems that have to be solved when applied to objects detection tasks .",
    "firstly , cnn has a multitude of convolutions that have to be calculated , it would be rather inefficient in object detection if using traditional dense sliding windows paradigm  @xcite .",
    "secondly , cnn has the property of shift invariance , that is , it is less sensitive to the shift of objects in input image patch",
    ". consequently , it can not achieve precise localization if it is directly applied to objects detection  @xcite .    to overcome these limitations of cnn , girshick _ et al .",
    "_ introduced the framework of region proposal based cnn ( called r - cnn )  @xcite and successfully applied it to object detection .",
    "the main idea of region proposal based cnn is performing cnns on candidate bounding - boxes ( called `` proposals '' ) which have potential to contain objects  @xcite . later , the updated version `` fast r - cnn ''  @xcite is proposed to improve the efficiency of object detection .",
    "this method combines r - cnn with sppnet  @xcite . in this way ,",
    "computation of proposals can be sharing and runtime of object detection can be reduced dramatically . however , in both r - cnn and fast r - cnn , the proposals are generated by selective search  @xcite , which is quite inefficient and thus limits the detection speed of these methods . to overcome this limitation",
    ", faster r - cnn  @xcite proposed to used region proposal networks ( rpns ) to generate proposals instead of selective search  @xcite . by this means , the stage proposal generation and cnn - based classification / regression can be performed under an unified framework and thus the detection speed can be boosted with the help of gpu",
    ".    however , region proposal based cnns are complex and not easy to optimize  @xcite .",
    "for this reason , several works attempt to achieve real - time objects detection by regarding it as a regression problem .",
    "yolo  @xcite is one of the pioneering works on deep regression networks based object detection .",
    "the approach is able to simultaneously outputs the location of bounding box , category and its confidence score for each object in the image at a extremely high frame rate .",
    "nevertheless , it does not work well in small objects detection .",
    "in the same vein , liu _",
    "et al . _ proposed ssd ( single shot multibox detector )  @xcite for real - time objects detection .",
    "it equipped the deep regression networks with several new techniques such as multi - scale feature maps and default boxes  @xcite . despite the fact that it is able to be faster and more accurate compared with yolo  @xcite ,",
    "its performance on small objects detection is still unsatisfactory .        in this paper",
    ", we introduce a practical and robust approach for real - time object detection in traffic scene .",
    "the approach requires less storage and computing resources , and thus it is feasible for traffic scene applications .",
    "the novelties of this work lie in four fold :    1 .",
    "we present a local regression strategy for accurate objects detection . as we know",
    ", current regression based solutions ( such as yolo  @xcite and ssd  @xcite ) employ global regression strategy to regress the bounding - box of each object from the whole image , which is actually a much more difficult task compared with local regression .",
    "thus , global regression strategy often needs to be supported by a complex or large - scale network and yet its performance on small objects detection is still unsatisfactory . to solve these problem",
    ", we introduce the local regression strategy that performs tiny regression networks on small image patches to detect and locate objects",
    ". as the regression networks are less sensitive to the scaling and shift of the objects in image patches , a series of sparse sliding - windows can be obtained from multi - scale image pyramid .",
    "finally , objects can be detected and located efficiently based on these sparse sliding - windows ; 2 .",
    "we introduce the generalized haar filter based deep networks where each weight larger than @xmath0 are constrained to the form of generalized haar filter in training phase . owing to the strong representation of haar filters , the networks are able to achieve a high performance . besides , the networks consume much less storage and computing resources compared with traditional deep networks , which make them possible to be utilized in traffic scene applications .",
    "in addition , the constraint of generalized haar filter provides a form of regularization which is able to improve the generalization ability of the deep networks ; 3 .   for object detection problems in traffic scene ,",
    "a sparse windows generation method is proposed .",
    "the method first generates a series of sparse sliding - windows in multi - scale image pyramid by setting a specific stride according to the scale and shift tolerance of our deep network . in this way , it can be ensure that each object is completely contained in at least one window .",
    "besides , in most object detection systems for traffic scene , camera is mounted on a fixed position ( e.g. mounted on the top of a vehicle windshield ) .",
    "consequently , objects ( e.g. vehicles and pedestrians ) produce the predetermined location - specific patterns in images . according to this assumption",
    ", perspective geometry is also utilized to further reduce the candidate windows ; 4 .",
    "we construct a tiny deep network that simultaneously outputs the bounding box , category and confidence score of detected object through two output channels : localization channel and classification channel .",
    "the network is efficient and consumes less resources . as our proposed method decomposes the global regression task into several easier local regression tasks , which can be handled effectively without the support of the complex or large - scale networks .",
    "thus , our proposed approach can work efficiently and effectively by combining this tiny a deep network with local regression tasks .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ rec_ghaar ] , we introduce the architecture of our generalized haar filter based deep networks and describe how to design their weights . in section  [ sec_sparse_windows ]",
    ", we propose the algorithm of sparse windows generation .",
    "experimental results and corresponding discussion are presented in section  [ sec_res_dis ] , while conclusions and future works are given in section  [ sec_conclu ] .",
    "to solve the problem of object detection , we construct a deep network that simultaneously outputs the bounding box , category and confidence score of detected object via two output channels : localization channel and classification channel ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_pipeline_net ] ) .",
    "the location channel focuses on bounding box regression and outputs a 4-dimensional vector @xmath1 which is used to describe a bounding box ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_locshow ] ) .",
    "the classification channel outputs the category and confidence score which are denoted by a 2-dimensional vector @xmath2 .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_pipeline_net ] , our deep network consists of 11 convolution layers , 4 max - pooling layers and 1 softmax layer . to reduce the memory consumption ,",
    "several low - level features are shared by localization and classification channels via conv1@xmath3pool4 .",
    "as these two channels aim at different tasks , each of them has 4 independent layers to focus on different problems .",
    "our deep network is less sensitive to the scaling and shift of the input object owing to regression based localization channel .",
    "consequently , instead of generating region proposals , objects can be detected and located efficiently based on sparse sliding - window paradigm and perspective geometry .",
    "more details on this issue are introduced in section  [ subsec_sliding_windows ] and related experiments are presented in section  [ sec_res_dis ] .",
    "despite the fact that deep neural networks have achieved state - of - the - art performance in object detection , they consume considerable storage , computing resources and power  @xcite .",
    "consequently , they are often unsuitable for power and memory constrained devices such as vehicle - mounted embedded systems and mobile devices . to overcome this limitation",
    ", we introduce a novel convolution weights design method which is based on generalized haar filter .",
    "haar - like filters have been successfully applied in object detection owing to their strong representation and high efficiency  @xcite . instead of using a fixed number of rectangles and configuration types , generalized haar filters",
    "are based on arbitrary configurations and number of rectangles  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the weights of our deep network are constrained based on generalized haar filters .    unlike original generalized haar filters with arbitrary configuration and number of rectangles  @xcite , in our work , the configuration and number of rectangles are obtained in a data - driven way . for a weight @xmath4 of size @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , we constrain it to the following form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a multiplication factor and @xmath9 is the @xmath10-th generalized haar filter in the haar filters space . as we know , there are @xmath11 types of configurations for the generalized haar filters of size @xmath5 . in our case ,",
    "@xmath9 and its negative form @xmath12 can be regarded as a same filter .",
    "thus , the haar filter space of size @xmath5 contains @xmath13 filters .",
    "that is , @xmath14 $ ] .    for a trained deep network for vehicle detection ,",
    "( [ fig_usagecount ] ) illustrates the filter usage in the @xmath0 haar filter space . as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_usagecount ] ) , filter usage is quite `` sparse '' . in other words ,",
    "a few generalized haar filters tend to be used much more frequent than the rest of filters in @xmath0 haar filter space .",
    "thus , these filters are more important and representative than the other filters . according to this fact",
    ", we try to reserve these `` important '' generalized haar filters and remove the rest of filters from haar filter space . in this way , the configuration and number of rectangles of generalized haar filters are obtained in a data - driven way .",
    "let @xmath15 denote the number of filter we try to reserve .",
    "we sort the filters according to their usage count and select the top @xmath15 filters ( @xmath16 in our work ) .",
    "these selected filters are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig_haarsel ] ) . then , the deep network is retrained by constraining the corresponding weights to these @xmath15 filters with multiplication factors .",
    "generalized haar filters are able to compress the deep networks by locking the relationship between each element in the weights larger than @xmath0 . in this way , considerable storage resources can be saved . for each weight of our deep network ,",
    "we only need to store a multiplication factor and a filter index . in this work ,",
    "each multiplication factor ( single - precision float - point ) takes 4 bytes and each filter index ( ranging from 1 to 32 ) takes less than 1 byte .",
    "thus , only 5 bytes are needed for each weight which is larger than @xmath0 . by contrast , in traditional deep networks , @xmath17 bytes are consumed for each weight of size @xmath5 . besides , despite the fact that weights are constrained according to @xmath15 generalized haar filters , each element of the weights is still able to keep a relatively high precision owing to the multiplication factors .    unlike approaches in  @xcite where haar filters are operated based on integral images .",
    "we calculate haar filter based convolution by basic addition and multiplication operation .",
    "one reason is that most weights in deep networks are relatively small ( @xmath0 and @xmath18 ) , accordingly , there is no obvious benefit in using integral images .",
    "moreover , integral image of each channel is needed to be re - computed for each layer , which is inefficient .",
    "besides , the configuration types and number of rectangles of the generalized haar filter are diverse due to our data - driven filter selection strategy , consequently , lots of different computation rules are needed to be designed for these selected filters if calculated based on integral images . in this way",
    ", it difficult to achieve efficient batch calculation .    in our work ,",
    "generalized haar filters only contains two types of elements : -1 and + 1 .",
    "thus , each generalized haar filter can be regarded as a sign pattern matrix .",
    "therefore , the weight @xmath4 can be written as : @xmath19    as we know , each convolution step can be regarded as a dot product operation .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the dot product between the haar filter @xmath9 and the input patch @xmath21 , that is : @xmath22    as a haar filter can be regarded as a sign pattern matrix , equation ( [ eq_dot_prod ] ) can be calculated by lookup table without multiplication .",
    "then each convolution step can be transformed to the following form : @xmath23 where `` @xmath24 '' denotes the sum of the matrix elements . in this way , only one multiplication is needed for each convolution step . by contrast , in traditional deep networks , @xmath25 multiplication are needed . in a work ,",
    "our approach consume much less computing resources , in this way , power consumption can be also reduced .",
    "accordingly , our deep network is suitable for embedded devices and fpga where power and available multipliers are limited .",
    "in addition , the constraint of generalized haar filter provides a form of regularization which is able to improve the generalization ability of the deep network .",
    "the loss function and the corresponding regularization term are introduced in the next subsection .",
    "our deep network has two output channels : localization channel and classification channel .",
    "each localization channel outputs a 4-dimensional vector @xmath26 . given the ground truth location vector @xmath27 ,",
    "the localization loss can be defined as a squared loss form : @xmath28    as classification channel focuses on a typical classification problem , we define the classification loss @xmath29 as a traditional softmax - loss form .    for a weight @xmath30 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) in our deep network ,",
    "the training goals is to obtain a haar filter index @xmath10 and a multiplication factor @xmath31 .",
    "each @xmath30 is constrained according to least squares principle , that is : @xmath32    for each haar filter in the haar filter space , the corresponding multiplication factor @xmath33 can be obtained by : @xmath34    from equation ( [ eq_deri ] ) , @xmath33 can be calculated : @xmath35    having obtained @xmath33 , we constrain each weight by adding a regularization term to its original loss function @xmath36 : @xmath37    this regularization term can not only reduce the storage consumption of our deep network , but also improve the generalization ability of the deep network .",
    "further experiments are presented in section  [ sec_res_dis ] .",
    "as the deep network are trained via stochastic gradient descent ( sgd ) , the loss function @xmath38 is needed to be transformed to a differentiable form . according to  @xcite",

    "the continuity and differentiability have been proofed by  @xcite .",

    "then , the haar filter index @xmath10 and a multiplication factor @xmath31 can be obtained by : @xmath48    the procedure for training our deep network is demonstrated in algorithm  [ alg_training ] . for the @xmath49-th weight of our deep network",
    ", we first construct the current weight using the filter index and multiplication factor which are updated in previous iteration .",
    "then , the target @xmath50 are obtained via a standard forward propagation approach .",
    "after that , based on the loss function @xmath51 ( see equation ( [ eq_weightloss ] ) ) , the gradients can be computed using a standard backward propagation approach .",
    "having obtained the gradients , weight is updated using stochastic gradient descent ( sgd ) .",

    "due to the regression based localization channel , our deep network is less sensitive to the scaling and shift of the input object . consequently , instead of traditional dense sliding - window paradigm",

    ", in most object detection systems for traffic scene , camera is mounted on a fixed position ( e.g. mounted on the top of a vehicle windshield ) .",
    "accordingly , objects ( e.g. vehicles and pedestrians ) produce the predetermined location - specific patterns in images .",
    "thus , the potential appearance of objects in the images can be obtained using the perspective geometry of the given scene .",
    "based on the perspective geometry , a series of sparse windows can be generated according to the scale and shift tolerance of our deep network .",
    "finally , the locations and categories of objects in the given image can be obtained efficiently by performing our deep network on these sparse windows .",
    "we first generate a set of input windows @xmath65 using sparse sliding - window strategy . in order to obtain @xmath65 which is able to fit the objects in different size , we define a size ratio for each input window . as shown in fig .",

    "<S> vision - based object detection is one of the fundamental functions in numerous traffic scene applications such as self - driving vehicle systems and advance driver assistance systems ( adas ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is also a challenging task due to the diversity of traffic scene and the storage , power and computing source limitations of the platforms for traffic scene applications . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a generalized haar filter based deep network which is suitable for the object detection tasks in traffic scene . in this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we first decompose a object detection task into several easier local regression tasks . </S>",
    "<S> then , we handle the local regression tasks by using several tiny deep networks which simultaneously output the bounding boxes , categories and confidence scores of detected objects . to reduce the consumption of storage and computing resources , the weights of the deep networks are constrained to the form of generalized haar filter in training phase . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we introduce the strategy of sparse windows generation to improve the efficiency of the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we perform several experiments to validate the performance of our proposed approach . </S>",
    "<S> experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is both efficient and effective in traffic scene compared with the state - of - the - art . </S>"
