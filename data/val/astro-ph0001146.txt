    "it is not yet known what exactly induces and maintains galactic warps .",
    "it may well be that a number of mechanisms  from among those proposed already , or some new ones ",
    "act together or alone to produce this ubiquitous phenomenon .",
    "some proposed mechanisms rely on a dark galactic halo as a direct actuator or as a mediator of perturbations ( for reviews with extensive references see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite )",
    ". the modified dynamics ( mond ) repudiates dark halos , but it offers a new mechanism that increases the warping efficacy of external perturbers over and above their possible tidal effects , which , notoriously , are too weak .",
    "this results from the nonlinearity of mond and is most clearly demonstrated in the case where a system ( a galaxy ) falls in an external field that by itself is approximately constant in space . in a linear theory , such as newtonian gravity",
    ", the constant external field has no effect on the internal dynamics of the system ( motions with respect to its center of mass ) ; in mond it very much does . when the external field dominates the internal field of the system it is easy to deduce what its effects are , as discussed e.g. in @xcite , and @xcite . in the present context",
    "the external acceleration is small compared with the internal ones at the position of the warp , which necessitates numerical studies .",
    "for our mechanism to work in field galaxies , one or more perturbers must be present .",
    "there is , indeed , growing evidence that the appearance of a warp in a galaxy is strongly correlated with the presence of nearby perturbers ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "even galaxies that had been thought to be isolated might , in fact , not be so ( @xcite ) .",
    "of course , perturber companions have always been suspected , but their direct tidal effects on disks seem to be too small .    the purpose of this letter is to demonstrate , by numerical solutions of simplified galaxy - perturber systems , that , with reasonable parameter values , this mond effect produces galactic warps of the magnitude observed .",
    "we have not included effects due to variations in the external field ( due to the motion of the perturber , or to the motion of the galaxy in a parent cluster ) . from the symmetry of our model problem",
    "the warps we produce have a straight line of nodes .",
    "the method is described in section 2 ; the results are detailed in sections 3 and 4 ; conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "we use the nonrelativistic , modified - gravity formulation of mond suggested by @xcite . the acceleration field @xmath0 produced by a mass distribution @xmath1 is derived from a potential @xmath2 that satisfies @xmath3= 4\\pi g\\rho\\ ] ] instead of the usual poisson equation @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for @xmath6 , and @xmath7 for @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the acceleration constant of mond . the form",
    "@xmath10 has been used in all rotation curve analyses , and we also use it here .",
    "this nonlinear potential equation is solved numerically using multi - grid methods as detailed in @xcite , and adumbrated in @xcite .",
    "we consider two classes of models . to simulate a far away companion , or the effect of the mean field of a cluster on a member galaxy , we solve for the field of a rigid disk in the presence of a given external acceleration field @xmath11 . in this case",
    "the field equation is solved subject to the boundary condition at infinity @xmath12 .",
    "then @xmath11 is subtracted from @xmath13 to get the field relative to the galaxy .",
    "this latter determines the galaxy s internal dynamics , warps , etc . to simulate the effect of a nearby companion , exemplified here by the effect of the magellanic clouds ( mc ) on the milky - way ( mw )",
    ", we solve fully for a disk - plus - perturber system ( in which case @xmath14 at infinity ) .",
    "then , the center - of - mass acceleration of the galaxy is computed using the surface - integral method given by eq.(14 ) of @xcite , and is subtracted from the acceleration field to get the internal dynamics .    in each case , after the acceleration field relative to the center of mass of the galaxy is found , we find closed , nearly circular , nearly planar , test - particle orbits .",
    "the orbits are integrated for many periods to insure that , within our accuracy and patience , they are closed .",
    "thus , inasmuch as adiabaticity is a good approximation , these are non - precessing orbits .",
    "they are also found to be stable under small changes in their initial conditions .",
    "these are taken to trace a warp , in the spirit of the tilted - ring model ( @xcite ) .",
    "we take the model galaxy to be an exponential disk smoothly truncated at a radius that we use as our unit length , @xmath15 , and with a scale length of @xmath16 in these units .",
    "the surface density is of the form @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the disk lies in the @xmath19 plane . to optimize the warping effect we take the external field to lie @xmath20 from the @xmath21 axis in the third quadrant of the @xmath22 plane .",
    "its absolute value is taken as @xmath23 in units of @xmath9 .",
    "( we work in units where @xmath24 , @xmath25 , so masses are given in units of @xmath26 . ) in a more extensive study we plan to calculate the effect as a function of the field direction ( relative to the disk axis ) and also to follow the test particle orbits as the external field changes with time to mimic the relative motion of the galaxy and perturber .",
    "for the present , pilot study we ran models with two values of the disk mass @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the ( mond ) accelerations of the isolated disk models at @xmath29 are @xmath30 ; i.e. respectively , ten and twenty times larger than the external field .",
    "both accelerations are small compared with 1 ( @xmath9 ) so we are rather deep in the mond regime in the warp region . in the deep - mond regime",
    "the theory has obvious scaling properties so the above parameters represent a family of models spanned e.g. by scaling by the same factor @xmath31 and @xmath32 , or @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 fixed ) .",
    "the results are summarized in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "we first show for each model a plot of the absolute value of the torque @xmath36 in the @xmath22 plane containing the disk axis and the external field ( @xmath37 is the field in the center - of - mass frame ) .",
    "this is a quantity that brings out clearly the departure of the field from both axisymmetry and left - right symmetry . in the spherical case @xmath38 everywhere ;",
    "in the isolated - disk case the @xmath38 line is the @xmath21 axis ( and the @xmath39 axis ) .",
    "this torque plot is also useful for homing in on closed orbits of the potential whose center is near the galactic center , because these should cross the @xmath22 plane near the zero - torque line .",
    "the orbits are found by actual integration , starting from a set of initial conditions .",
    "the projections of some such orbits are then shown .",
    "we surmise that in the spirit of the tilted - ring model they delineate the shape of the warp .",
    "the disk of the milky way is known to be warped beyond the solar circle ( @xcite , and for a recent description and references @xcite ) . at galactic longitude @xmath40 the hi disk curls steadily away from the plane . at @xmath41 the disk curves southward before turning back towards the plane ( see @xcite for an analytic expression that approximates the warp shape beyond 11 kpc ) .    the line of nodes in the tilted - ring picture is straight within the uncertainties , and is nearly perpendicular to the plane spanned by the inner - disk axis and the radius vector to the magellanic clouds .",
    "this makes the cloud system a prime suspect in producing the warp .",
    "it was , however , appreciated long ago that the tidal field of the clouds , in their present position , is too small to distort the disk to the extent observed .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated that a cloud mass @xmath42 would generate a warp of amplitude @xmath43 70 pc at a radius of 16 kpc .",
    "it has , however , been suggested by @xcite that a `` live '' halo that actively responds to the perturbation of the clouds might augment the effect to produce a warp of the observed magnitude and geometry .",
    "mond , as we said , excludes a dynamically important halo , but might lead to a large enough warp due to the non - linear effect discussed above .",
    "we model the system as follows .",
    "the mw is taken as a pure disk in the @xmath19 plane , centered at the origin , with the cutoff , exponential surface - density law described in section 3 ( with @xmath16 ) ; its dimensionless mass is @xmath44 .",
    "the magellanic clouds are represented by one point mass @xmath45 at a position whose dimensionless coordinates are ( 2.52 , 0 , -1.63 ) .",
    "this is at @xmath46 from the center of the galaxy , and at the correct galactic latitude of the lmc .",
    "this ratio would correspond for example to @xmath47 kpc ( @xcite ) and an lmc distance of 45 mpc ( @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties in these parameters are still large .",
    "two mass ratios were considered : @xmath48 .",
    "( the b luminosity ratio of the clouds to the mw is about 0.2 .",
    "since the baryonic @xmath49 values of the two might be different , reasonable values of the mass ratio lie between 0.1 and 0.4 . ) other nearby galaxies are expected to have a smaller effect than the lmc ; for example , m31 , despite its higher mass , causes a rather smaller acceleration near the mw .    in figure [ fig3 ] we show , for each mass ratio , two closed , quasi - circular , stable orbits beyond the cutoff radius of the disk  presumed to delineate our calculated warp  together with a representation of the observed warp ( as given by the formula in @xcite ) .",
    "we see that for a constant external field whose ratio to the field of the isolated disk at @xmath50 is only ( 5 - 10)@xmath51 , a noticeable warp beyond this radius is indicated by test - particle orbits .",
    "this acceleration ratio increases in proportion to the galactocentric radius , but , still , rotational velocities will be affected only little even up to @xmath52 . note that the warp is not symmetric but is less pronounced on the attracting side of the field .",
    "we used an external - field inclination that is favorable for an s - shape warp .",
    "when the field is in the disk plane , the axisymmetry is broken but the up - down one is not , so no warp will be induced .",
    "if the field is perpendicular to the disk , axisymmetry is preserved but not the up - down one ; this might induce bowl - shaped warps .",
    "( in the limit of a highly dominant , perpendicular , external field , the analytic results in @xcite show that the geometry remains up - down symmetric , but for a weak perturbing field this is not so . )    regarding the results for the mw - mc system , we see that even for a mass ratio of 0.1 a satellite at the position of the mc produces enough field distortion to accommodate inclined , quasi - circular orbit that rise to @xmath53 at @xmath54 on one side , and to a height of @xmath55 at @xmath56 on the other . with a mass ratio of 0.2 the amplitude of the warp is close to that observed for the mw .",
    ". a larger volume of the parameter space has to be surveyed .",
    "this includes more values of the relative strength of the perturbation , different disk - perturber alignments ( leading perhaps to a wider varieties of warp shapes ) , more complex perturbations such as two or more satellites , which would bend the line of nodes at larger radii , where we can not approximate the combined effect by a constant field .",
    "we would also have to study other galaxy mass distributions .",
    "for example , we expect that if a considerable fraction of the galaxy mass is put in a round bulge , a warp will form more easily . for the same reason , if @xmath57 is smaller ( but the mc distance remains the same ) the warp will be stronger at the same position .",
    ". we must reckon with the fact that in many relevant cases the geometry of the perturbation changes considerably during the response time of the disk ( say the orbital period at the position of the warp ) .",
    "this is true of galaxies moving in or near the core of galaxy clusters ; it is also true for the mw - mc system .",
    "the warp geometry will thus not just follow the perturbation adiabatically but , at larger radii , the geometry may reflect the past history of the perturbation ( leading , among other things , to curvature of the line of nodes ) . according to proper - motion observations and models of the mc and the magellanic stream motion",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) , the mc binary is moving on a nearly polar orbit around the galaxy with a tangential velocity that is now comparable with the rotational velocity of the galaxy .",
    "this means that the radius vector to the mc changes its angle with the galaxy s axis by @xmath58 during the galaxy s orbital period at about 15 kpc .",
    "this means that the adiabaticity assumption we have made might be broken , and more and more so at larger radii .",
    "our subtraction of a constant center - of - mass acceleration is then also not valid .",
    "this could lead to a more complicated warp geometry than the integral - sign shape that we get with adiabaticity . because the mc orbit is nearly polar we expect the line of nodes to remain straight .",
    "we think self - gravity of the mass in the warped region is not so important .",
    "this is because the relative contribution of the warped mass to the acceleration field is small everywhere , even within the warp itself .",
    "( the surface density in the warp is smaller than the integrated surface density there . )",
    "this contribution can then be treated as a perturbation  linearizing in it the mond field equation  and in mond such density perturbations produce an even weaker effect than in newtonian dynamics ( hence the added stability in mond ) .",
    "so we can at least expect that the nonlinearity of mond will not beget some peculiar amplification of self gravity .",
    "but we do not really know what these effects might be  a point that has to be checked numerically .",
    "we plan to perform @xmath59-body simulations whereby the @xmath60-body warped disk and the point - mass perturber orbit each other . this will account for non - adiabaticity and for self gravity in the disk , and also partly for point 2 above ."
