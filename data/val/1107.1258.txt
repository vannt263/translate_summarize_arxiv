    "because of the deleterious effects of interstellar reddening and extinction , it is difficult to establish an empirical picture of the cepheid instability strip based entirely upon observations of milky way cepheids .",
    "the use of extragalactic cepheids is not necessarily a practical solution to the problem , since the available data for milky way cepheids are generally more extensive and of greater precision , and the effects of internal reddening within other galaxies are not as well established as they are locally .",
    "such considerations justify the continued use of the galactic sample in studies aimed at establishing reliable intrinsic properties of classical cepheid variables .",
    "the determination of accurate reddenings for cepheids has traditionally followed three different routes : ( i ) from field reddenings of specific objects ( e.g. , binary , cluster , association , or isolated cepheids ) based upon the analysis of photometric data for early - type stars sharing the same lines of sight , ( ii ) from observations mainly of bright cepheids involving photometric parameters designed to be independent of interstellar reddening , and ( iii ) from using standard reddening laws and a calibrated intrinsic color relation ( either observational or model generated ) to deredden photometric observations for large samples of cepheids . methods ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "are the most reliable means of establishing reddenings for individual cepheids since method ( iii ) may entail use of period - color relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which do not account for the intrinsic spread in effective temperature of the cepheid instability strip and may generate erroneous results ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for method ( ii",
    ") , spectroscopic indices related to stellar effective temperature and designed to be independent , or relatively independent , of interstellar and atmospheric extinction include the @xmath1-index @xcite , which measures the depression of the _ g_-band of ch ( @xmath24305 ) relative to the local continuum , the @xmath3-index , which samples the strength of the h@xmath3 balmer line of hydrogen relative to the surrounding continuum , and the _ khg_-index of brigham young university @xcite , which measures the strengths of ca ii k ( @xmath23933 ) , balmer h@xmath4 ( @xmath24101 ) , and the _ g_-band through narrow band interference filters in a manner independent of extinction .",
    "a more recent technique @xcite involves the use of line depth ratios between c i and si ii lying on the brackett continuum near 10728  .",
    "a similar technique was used by @xcite using spectral lines falling in the red region of cepheid spectra . @xcite",
    "have taken the technique to its ultimate level of sophistication by using high resolution optical spectra of cepheids throughout their cycles in conjunction with stellar atmosphere models to track their changes in effective temperature , and thus intrinsic broad band color .",
    "the use of close neighbours to deduce reddenings for cepheids appears to date from its application to the blue companion of @xmath4 cep by @xcite ; it has also been used recently for cepheids studied with the hubble space telescope @xcite .",

    "an often - ignored feature of interstellar reddening is that no single relationship accurately describes it over all regions of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "regional variations in the reddening law depend directly upon direction viewed through the milky way , vary slowly with galactic longitude , and are tied to differences in the distribution of particle sizes for dust lying along different lines of sight .",
    "the resulting galactic longitude and latitude dependence of the extinction law affects interstellar reddening studies that implicitly use a relationship of fixed parameterization to describe the extinction in a particular color system , and should be most important for stars of large reddening .",
    "several of the cepheids in the present sample are heavily reddened , so the extinction laws for the fields of each object were established prior to the analysis by taking advantage of existing studies for regions reasonably close to the program objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "a few objects in the sample appear to be type ii cepheids , but that does not affect the results . in most cases",
    "the implied reddening near the cepheid is fairly evident .",
    "the results of the variable - extinction studies of the sample cepheids are presented in table  [ tab2 ] , which lists the inferred space reddening for each cepheid derived from likely af - type stars lying within different angular radii , from @xmath357 to @xmath267 distant , and the reddening inferred from 2mass _ jhk_@xmath250 colors for stars within @xmath267 of the cepheid .",
    "the adopted color excess in each case , column ( 8) , was the average for all af - type stars lying within @xmath267 of the cepheid and of comparable inferred distance , and the resulting reddening , which is equivalent to that for a star of spectral type b0 , was converted in the last column of the table to a value appropriate for the derived intrinsic color of the cepheid , again using the relationship of @xcite .",
    "the number of stars used to obtain the space reddening is listed in the second last column of table  [ tab2 ] . in rich fields",
    "that number is of order @xmath3581020 , whereas in more poorly populated regions or fields with a larger spread in reddening , less than half a dozen reference stars were available .",
    "two solutions are presented for uy mon , for reasons indicated later , although the adopted solution for the cepheid is the first .",
    "it is worth noting that the 2mass reddenings fall closer to the converted color excess for the cepheid than to the b0-star reddenings .",
    "a reasonable explanation lies in the fact that the baf - star reddenings in a 2mass color - color diagram tend to be dominated by the af stars , particularly likely f - type stars , since b - type stars are less common in the small fields analyzed and are potentially affected by circumstellar affects @xcite .",
    "the 2mass reddenings are also important for providing confirmation of the relationship used to convert b0-star color excesses to those appropriate for a star with the average unreddened colors of the cepheid , which are very similar to f - type dwarfs in the 2mass samples .",
    "the derived intrinsic colors are presented in table  3 , which also provides in column ( 3 ) the variable star type designation for the object from the _ general catalogue of variable stars _",

    "the spread in color at a given value of pulsation period _",
