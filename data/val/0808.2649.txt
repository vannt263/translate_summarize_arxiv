    "dune motion , sand encroachment and desertification are based on sand transport by wind .",
    "saltation is the basic mechanism of aeolian sand flux  @xcite . the simplest and most common devices to measure it in the field are so called sand traps .",
    "they consist of cavities into which the sand bearing wind enters , drops the sand inside and then leaves again without the sand . in that way they accumulate inside the sand that would have crossed them during a given time , giving a measure for the flux through their cross section .",
    "the difficulty to quantitative gauge them arises in properly estimating this cross section because the trap being an extended fixed object modifies considerably the wind velocity field in its surrounding .",
    "the issue boils down to understand how much wind actually enters into the cavity and therefore strongly depends on the geometrical shape of the trap .    among the many different trap designs that have been used in",
    "the past one of the simplest and most popular is a hollow cylinder with two slits , one open and the other covered by a membrane that is impermeable to the grains  @xcite see fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] .",
    "it has been extensively implemented in field studies along the northern coast of brazil with much success .",
    "we will therefore study this particular device in detail by numerically solving the turbulent flow around an object having the corresponding geometry .",
    "we will calculate the trajectories of grains released at different positions in the area in front of the trap to assess if they are captured or not and do this for various reynolds and stokes numbers as well as different membrane permeabilities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section @xmath0",
    ", we introduce the model and briefly summarize the algorithm used in our simulation . in section",

    "the widths of the vertical slits at the front and back sides are @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "two possible grain trajectories are sketched.,width=377,height=529 ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] the sand trap that we study consists of a hollow cylinder of diameter @xmath6 and height @xmath3 closed on the top and the bottom , and having two vertical slits , one at the front and another at the back side .",
    "for simplicity we will neglect the width of the cylinder walls .",
    "a membrane covers the slit of the back side in order to capture particles with diameters larger than @xmath7 .",
    "the slits at the front and back sides have widths @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we chose a height @xmath8 , a diameter @xmath9 and slit widths @xmath10 on the front side and @xmath11 on the back side in agreement with typical dimensions of real devices .",
    "the membrane has a thickness of @xmath12 .",
    "its permeability @xmath13 can be modified and will be one of the control parameters of our simulation . in order to simulate the conditions of a realistic wind field we consider a box of size @xmath14 with moving boundaries on top , left and right , i.e. in all directions transverse to the wind direction except for the bottom . on the fixed walls , i.e. the trap surface and the bottom we impose non - slip boundary conditions , which means that the velocity is equal to zero at the interfaces between solid and fluid . in order to reduce the size effects",
    "the simulation box was chosen to be one order of magnitude larger than diameter @xmath6 of the trap .",
    "we assume that atmospheric air is an incompressible and newtonian fluid having a viscosity of @xmath15 and a density of @xmath16 .",
    "the reynolds number is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the average velocity and @xmath19 the linear size of the box in @xmath20 direction .",
    "this gives in our case @xmath21 meaning that we can assume to be in a fully developed homogeneous turbulent state .",
    "the standard @xmath22 model is therefore an adequate way to solve the corresponding reynolds - averaged navier - stokes equations of motion .",
    "their numerical solution can be achieved by discretizing the velocity and pressure fields and using a control volume finite - difference technique  @xcite .",
    "the convergence criteria of this scheme can be defined in terms of residuals , which measure up to which degree the conservation laws are satisfied . in our simulation",
    "we consider that convergence is achieved when each of the normalized residuals is smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "a fully turbulent atmospheric boundary layer over a flat surface shows a logarithmic increase of the velocity @xmath24 with the distance @xmath25 from the surface .",
    "therefore , we impose a logarithmic velocity profile on the inlet , i.e. in the @xmath26 plane , of the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the shear velocity , @xmath29 the so called roughness length and @xmath30 is the von krmn constant  @xcite .",
    "we model the fabric covering the opening at the backside of the trap as a special type of boundary condition mimicking a porous medium where the velocity / pressure drop characteristics are known .",
    "if @xmath31 is the thickness of this membrane then the pressure drop is defined according to darcy s law as : @xmath32 where @xmath13 is the permeability of the medium and @xmath33 is the velocity normal to the membrane . in order to understand the effect of the membrane on the wind velocity field , we perform simulations using different membrane permeabilities , namely @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .        for simplicity we will only consider spherical particles .",
    "we also assume that the density of flying particles is so low that we can neglect collisions between them .",
    "for the same reason we will also neglect the momentum loss exerted by the particles on the fluid . consequently the wind velocity and pressure fields can be calculated without knowing the particle positions and one can then obtain the trajectory of each particle by just integrating its equation of motion : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the mass and the velocity of a particle of diameter @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the total force acting on this particle . let us assume that drag and gravity are the only relevant forces and that the particles do not interact with each other .",
    "then the equation of motion for one particle can be rewritten as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is gravity acceleration and @xmath45 is a typical value for the density of sand particles .",
    "the term @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_4 ] ) represents the drag force per unit particle - mass where @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the particle reynolds number and for the drag coefficient @xmath49 we use an empirical expression taken from ref .",
    "the trajectories of the particles are calculated by numerically integrating the equation of motion eq .",
    "( [ eq_4 ] ) .",
    "we characterize the effect of inertia on the air borne grains in the flow field through the dimensionless _ stokes _ number @xmath50 which is defined by @xmath51 . for @xmath52",

    "behave as tracers and will perfectly follow the streamlines of the fluid . in our simulation we will vary the stokes number by changing the particle diameter keeping all the other parameters constant .",
    "if a particle hits the outer surface of the sand trap it will be reflected elastically .",
    "if it hits the inner part of the trap it will stop moving , i.e. is counted as captured .",
    "we first present a study of the influence of the permeability @xmath13 of the membrane on the fluid velocity field without the presence of particles . in order to understand essential features of the flow field around and inside the sand trap",

    "the value of @xmath67 was obtained from the average over different heights @xmath25 , where at each one we released @xmath81 particles .",
    "we see that @xmath67 presents two different regimes as function of the permeability @xmath13 .",
    "let us first discuss the case of low permeabilities . in the limit of small stokes numbers",
    "the efficiency of the sand trap is small and remains essentially constant close to zero . since @xmath87 the particles can be considered as tracers that nearly exactly follow the streamlines of the flow , avoiding trapping because practically no streamline crosses the interior of the trap as consequence of the low membrane permeability .",
    "indeed we observe in these cases stagnation zones inside the sand trap .",
    "above @xmath88 the efficiency @xmath67 increases as function of the stokes number . for high values of",
    "@xmath50 the efficiency reaches a saturation value close to unity .",
    "in this limiting case the particles move ballistically towards the sand trap and those that have been released within the range @xmath89 are captured .    for high permeabilities",
    "@xmath13 , the efficiency @xmath67 presents an unexpected behavior in the region of low @xmath50 , as shown in fig .  [ fig_7 ] . for large stokes numbers the efficiency @xmath67 remains constant until @xmath90 . below this value",
    "surprisingly we detect a small minimum followed by an increase to a value that can be above one .",
    "we can explain this behavior observing the particle trajectories in the region close to the entrance of the sand trap as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] .    for small membrane permeability",
    "the sand trap behaves like a solid cylinder . in this case",
    "a stagnation region appears in front of the trap around the symmetry line .",
    "as the permeability @xmath13 increases some air can cross the sand trap and two stagnation zones appear beside the entrance and outside of the trap .",
    "each of them has a separation point and all particle trajectories between these two separation points bend towards the center and enter the trap as confirmed in the simulation for low stokes number as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_8 ] . therefore the number of captured particles and the efficiency of the sand trap can increase beyond the ballistic case .    for a fixed value of @xmath50 and different permeabilities @xmath13 ,",
    "we search the maximum distance from the symmetry line @xmath76 at which the particles bend towards the entrance of the sand trap . this @xmath76 can be used as a measure for the increase in the sand trap efficiency . in fig .",
    "[ fig_9 ] , we show in a semi - log plot the efficiency @xmath67 , which has been calculated from the parameter @xmath76 , against the membrane permeability @xmath13 . clearly , the curves display a strong change starting at the permeability @xmath91 .",
    "this is the smallest permeability which still affects the efficiency of the sand trap .",
    "in this paper , we have studied numerically the behavior of a sand trap frequently used to measure aeolian sand transport in the field .",
    "we solved the turbulent wind velocity field in the presence of the sand trap and investigated the effect of the membrane permeability .",
    "we studied quantitatively the particle trajectories carried by the fluid for different membrane permeabilities .",
    "we have shown how the efficiency of the sand trap depends on the stokes number and gave some insight about the effect of the membrane permeability on the capturing process .    as previously observed",
    "the membrane permeability strongly influences the capture process at low stokes numbers . the sand trap efficiency @xmath67 exhibits a surprising increase above one , for large permeabilities and small stokes numbers .",
    "let us point out that only at higher @xmath50 values , when the trajectories of the particles are completely ballistic , the efficiency @xmath67 becomes independent on the membrane permeability .",
    "this is a useful result since for natural sand , for example on dunes , the grain size is around @xmath92 which corresponds to a rather high stokes number .",
    "our results therefore confirm that this type of sand trap is adequate to measure aeolian sand flux .",
    "the area of the slit at the entrance essentially equals the cross section over which the sand flux is measured independently on the details of the membrane on the back side .",
