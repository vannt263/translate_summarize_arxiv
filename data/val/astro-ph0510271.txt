    "recent observational and theoretical studies suggest that gravitational microlensing can induce variability in the x - ray emission of lensed qsos .",
    "microlensing of the fe k@xmath0 line has been reported at least in three macrolensed qsos : mg j0414 + 0534 @xcite , qso 2237 + 0305 @xcite , and h1413 + 117 @xcite .",
    "the influence of microlensing in the x - ray emission has been also theoretically investigated .",
    "@xcite simulated the variation of the x - ray continuum due to microlensing showing that the flux magnifications for the x - ray and optical continuum emission regions are not significantly different during the microlensing event , while @xcite found that simulated spectral variations caused by microlensing show different behaviour , depending on photon energy .",
    "also , microlensed light curves for thin accretion disks around schwarzschild and kerr black holes were considered in @xcite and microlensing light curves for the fe k@xmath0 were simulated by @xcite . on the other hand , the influence of microlensing in the fe k@xmath0 spectral line shape was discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that objects in a foreground galaxy with even relatively small masses can produce observable changes in the fe k@xmath0 line flux , much stronger than those expected for the uv and optical lines ( @xcite ) . in the optical spectra ,",
    "microlensing induced magnification of broad uv lines ( e.g. , civ and siv / oiv ) was reported by richards et al .",
    "consequently , one can expect that microlensing of the fe k@xmath0 line region can be more frequent .",
    "observations of the x - ray continuum and the fe k@xmath0 line in multi - imaged agns open new possibilities for the study of the unresolved x - ray emitting structure in qsos , particularly for high redshifted qsos @xcite .",
    "however , an explanation for different behavior of line and continuum variability in the observed events should be given in context of the microlensing hypothesis .",
    "@xcite detected an increase of the fe k@xmath0 equivalent width in the image b of the lensed qso j0414 + 0534 that was not followed by the continuum .",
    "@xcite explained the non - enhancement of the continuum emission in the spectrum of image b by proposing that the thermal emission region of the disk and the compton up - scattered emission region of the hard x - ray source lie within smaller radii than the iron - line reprocessing region . analyzing the x - ray variability of qso 2237 + 0305a ,",
    "@xcite also measured amplification of the fe k@xmath0 line in component a of qso 2237 + 0305 but not in the continuum . however , in this case the interpretation was different .",
    "@xcite suggested that the larger size of the continuum emission region ( @xmath2 cm @xmath1 100 r@xmath3 for m@xmath4 ) with respect to the fe k@xmath0 emission region ( @xmath1 10 r@xmath3 ) could explain this result .",
    "finally , in h  1413 + 117 @xcite found that the continuum and the fe k@xmath0 line were enhanced by a different factor .    with the aim of discussing these results",
    ", we will model here the behavior of the x - ray continuum and the fe k@xmath0 line during a microlensing event for different sizes of the continuum and the fe k@xmath0 line emission regions .",
    "the assumption of a disk geometry for the distribution of the fe k@xmath0 emitters is supported by the spectral shape of this line in agn ( e.g. @xcite , where they have investigated the iron line properties of 18 sy 1 galaxies ) . regarding the x - ray continuum emission",
    ", it seems that it mainly arises from an accretion disk .",
    "for instance , @xcite have shown that the x - ray spectral variability of mcg-6 - 30 - 15 can be modeled by a two - component model where the one varying component is a power - law and the other constant component is produced by very strong reflection from a relativistic disk .    to study the effects of microlensing on a compact accretion disk we will use the ray tracing method considering only those photon trajectories that reach the sky plane at a given observer s angle @xmath5 ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the amplified brightness with amplification @xmath6 for the continuum",
    "is given by    @xmath7    and for the fe k@xmath0 line by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the temperature , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the impact parameters which describe the apparent position of each point of the accretion disk image on the celestial sphere as seen by an observer at infinity ; @xmath12 is the the line transition energy ( @xmath13 kev ) and @xmath14 is the energy shift due to relativistic effects ( @xmath15 is the observed energy and @xmath16 is the emitted energy from the disk ) . here we will not consider the cosmological redshift .",
    "the emissivity of the disk is one of the important parameters which has influence on the continuum and line shapes .",
    "the observed continuum flux is very often fitted with one or two black - body components in the soft x - ray , in addition to the hard x - ray power law ( see e.g. page et al .",
    "the line shape , as well as the continuum distribution , strongly depend on emissivity law . in the standard shakura - sunyaev disc model @xcite",
    ", accretion occurs via an optically thick and geometrically thin disc .",
    "the effective optical depth in the disc is very high and photons are close to thermal equilibrium with electrons .",
    "the surface temperature is a function of disk parameters and results in the multicolor black body spectrum .",
    "this component is thought to explain the blue bump in agn and the soft x - ray emission in galactic black holes .",
    "although the standard model does not predict the power - law x - ray emission observed in all sub - eddington accreting black holes , the power law for the x - ray emissivity in agn is usually accepted ( see e.g. nandra et al .",
    "but one can not exclude other emissivity laws , such as black - body or modified black - body emissivity laws .",
    "therefore , we will use here black - body , modified black - body and power emissivity laws for both ; the fe k@xmath0 and continuum emission .    in the case of the black - body radiation law",
    ", the disk emissivity is given as ( e.g. jaroszyski et al . 1992 ) :    @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the speed of light , @xmath20 is the planck constant , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath22 is the surface temperature of x - ray accretion disk .    in principle",
    ", one can assume different distribution of the surface temperature along disk .",
    "to obtained the x - ray continuum distribution using eq .",
    "( 3 ) one can assume that @xmath23 , taking that the black hole is powerful x - ray sources with an effective temperature 10@xmath24 to 10@xmath25 k. but , regarding the standard disk model it is expected that the surface temperature at least is radially dependent .",
    "therefore , here we will accept the radial distribution of surface temperature given by @xcite : @xmath26 taking that an effective temperature is in an interval from 10@xmath24 to 10@xmath25 k. the distribution of the temperature along the radius of the disk used in this paper is given in fig .",
    "1 ( top ) and corresponding shape of spectral energy distribution is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom ) . in eq . ( 4 ) @xmath27 is the dimensionless parameter defined as : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is disk radius , expressed in gravitational radii @xmath30 .",
    "however , in the innermost part of the accretion disk the planck function can not be used properly .",
    "therefore we will use also the standard ( classical ) shakura  sunyaev approach , where the emissivity law is described by a `` modified '' black - body radiation law ( eqs .",
    "( 3.4 ) , ( 3.8 ) in @xcite ; see also the discussion in @xcite ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite used similar expressions to study microlensing in the optical continuum .",
    "taking into account that the observed hard x - ray continuum has a power - law type spectral shape , we will also assume that the time - independent intrinsic emissivity of the continuum is : @xmath33 where , according to the investigation of observed x - ray spectra , @xmath34 and @xmath0 are taken to be 1.5 and 2.5 ( see e.g. doviak et al .",
    "for the fe k@xmath0 emission in this case we used the same calculation as in popovi et al .",
    "( 2003a , b ) .",
    "we should note here , that disk may be considered to be composed of a number of distinct parts with different physical conditions ( e.g. radiation pressure dominant part , matter pressure dominant part , etc .",
    "see e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) . consequently",
    ", in general one can expect that the disk can be described by different emissivity laws in different parts ( e.g. the black - body law may be applied in outer part of the disk ) .",
    "taking into account a huge number of parameters which should be considered in the case of microlensed disk ( see the next section ) , we will consider only one emissivity law for whole disk .",
    "the total observed flux for the continuum and the fe k@xmath0 line is given as @xmath35d\\omega , \\ ] ] where @xmath36 is the solid angle subtended by the disk in the observer s sky and the integral extends over the whole emitting region .",
    "as one can see from eq .",
    "( 7 ) the total observed flux is a sum of the continuum and the line fluxes , consequently , the amplification in the continuum and in the fe k@xmath0 line can be considered separately as two independent components . on the other hand , the amplifications will depend on the sizes and geometry of the continuum and line emitting regions . in further text",
    "we will consider amplifications in the line and in the continuum separately .",
    "we would like to point out here that the aim of the paper is not to create the perfect accretion disk model ( taking into account different effects that can be present as e.g. opacity of the disk , spots in the disk etc . ) , but only to illustrate the influence of microlensing on the continuum and the fe k@xmath0 line amplification and demonstrate that this phenomenon could essentially change general conclusions .",
    "therefore , we will use the three emissivity laws of the disk and the very important effect of strong gravitation ( beaming and light - bending in schwarzschild and kerr metrics ) .      to apply the model one needs to define a number of parameters that describe the emission region and the deflector . in principle , we should find constraints for the : size of the disk emission region , disk inclination angle , mass of the black hole , accretion rate , relative amplification , the constant @xmath37 ( chartas et al .",
    "2002 , popovi et al .",
    "2003 ) , orientation of the caustic with respect to the rotation axis , direction of the caustic crossing and microlens mass . in the following subsections we choose and",
    "discuss the parameters used in the calculations .      for the disk inclination",
    "we adopt the averaged values given by @xcite from the study of the fe k@xmath0 line profiles of 18 seyfert 1 galaxies : @xmath38 .",
    "the inner radius , @xmath39 , can not be smaller than the radius of the marginally stable orbit , @xmath40 , that corresponds to @xmath41 ( gravitational radii , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is gravitational constant , @xmath44 is the mass of central black hole , and @xmath19 is the velocity of light ) in the schwarzschild metric and to @xmath45 in the case of the kerr metric with angular momentum parameter @xmath46 . to select the outer radius , @xmath47 , we take into account previous investigations of the x - ray variability that support very compact x - ray emitting disks . in particular , @xcite from the observed variation in the lensed blazar pks 1830 - 211 infer a size of the x - ray continuum emission region of @xmath48 , that is in agreement with estimation for qso 2237 + 03050 given by @xcite .",
    "so , considering a range of black hole masses of @xmath49 we can conclude that the x - ray emission is coming from a compact region of the order of 10 to 100 @xmath30 .",
    "this range of sizes is also acceptable for the fe k@xmath0 emission region ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to explore the suitability of the various hypothesis explaining the lack of adequate response of the x - ray continuum to the microlensing events detected in the fe k@xmath0 line ( see  1 ) , we are going to consider several combinations of disk sizes for the emitters of both the continuum and the line : ( i ) the inner and outer radii of both emission regions are the same , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; ( ii ) the inner radius is the same , @xmath50 , but the outer radius of the x - ray continuum disk is smaller , @xmath51 , than the radius of the line emission disk , @xmath52 ; ( iii ) the continuum emission disk has radii @xmath50 , @xmath51 and the line emission disk @xmath53 and @xmath52 ( the continuum emission takes place in an inner part of disk surrounded by an annulus of fe k@xmath0 emission ) ; ( iv ) the continuum emission disk has radii @xmath54 , @xmath55 and the line emission disk @xmath56 and @xmath51 ( the fe k@xmath0 emission is located in the inner disk and the continuum emission in the outer annulus ) .",
    "we adopt the central object mass and accretion rate from @xcite .",
    "we assume a black hole of mass @xmath57 and accretion rate @xmath58 in eddington units @xmath59 .",
    "we will use this value in order to determine the effective temperature distribution .",
    "these values are in agreement with @xcite where it was found that the majority of qsos have black hole masses in the range of @xmath60 , and accretion rates ranging from 0.01 to 1 in units of the eddington accretion rate .",
    "it is difficult to discuss the validity of different emissivity laws for demonstation of the x - ray emission ( in the line as well as in the continuum ) , but sometimes , as for example in the case of black - body emissivity law , the emissivity at x - ray wavelengths can be extremely small compared with , for example , optical wavelengths , and x - ray photons are emitted from a quite small region . in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom ) , we presented the continuum shapes for different emisivity laws used in the calculation ( maximum of each is normalized to one ) .",
    "the shapes of the continuum were calculated for different dimensions of the disk .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "1 ( bottom ) , the shape of the continuum strongly depends not only on emissivity law , but also on disk dimensions",
    ".      different types of caustics can be used to explain the observed microlensing events in quasars . moreover , for the exact event one can model the caustic shape to obtain different parameters ( see e.g. abajas et al .",
    "2004 , kochanek 2004 for the case of q2237 + 0305 ) . in order to apply an appropriate microlens model ,",
    "first we will consider a standard microlensing magnification pattern ( figure 2 , left ) for the q2237 + 0305a image with 16 einstein ring radii ( err ) on a side and @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the mass of microlens is taken to be 1@xmath64 .",
    "the simulation was made employing ray - shooting techniques that send rays from the observer through the lens to the source plane ( kayser et al .",

    "we presented a comparison between the projected magnification map in the source plane and an accretion disk with a size of 1000 r@xmath3 ( presented as a circle in figure 2 , right ) .",
    "taking into account the small dimensions of the x - ray emission region ( several 10s r@xmath3 ) the approximation of a straight fold caustic can be assumed for this pattern .",
    "we explored the general behavior of the total continuum and fe k@xmath0 flux amplification due to microlensing .",
    "first we used the straight fold caustic approximation .",

    "the errs ( expressed in gravitational radii ) are computed for different deflector masses and for a black hole mass of @xmath67 .",
    "we found that even deflectors with small mass have err with sizes from several tens to several hundreds of gravitational radii . to obtain a qualitative understanding of the influence of the microlens mass on our results we consider microlens masses that correspond to err values equal to 50 r@xmath3",

    "( 2002 , 2004 ) and dai ( 2003 ) and supports the conclusions of these authors that enhancement of the fe k@xmath0 line observed in only one of the images of a lensed quasar was caused by microlensing .",
    "some interesting results can be inferred from our exploratory work : ( a ) when both the line and continuum disk profiles have the same inner radius , the differences in outer radius can not cause significant differences in the total line and the continuum flux variation ( see figs .",
    "5a , b ) for the considered emission laws , ( b ) when we separate the emission considering an inner disk contributing to the continuum and an outer annulus contributing to the fe k@xmath0 line ( or vice - versa ) we found significant differences between the continuum and the line amplification ( see figures . 5c , d , 6  8) , ( c ) the results are qualitatively similar for all considered emissivity laws ( see figs . 5 - 8 )",
    ", ( d ) interchanging between schwarzschild and kerr metrics induces only slight differences in normalized flux amplification ( see figs .",
    "5 - 7 ) .",
    "figures 5 - 8 were intended to explore the two scenarios suggested by @xcite and @xcite to explain the non observed associated enhancement of the x - ray continuum in objects with a microlensed fe k@xmath0 line .",
    "this behavior can be expected in case ( iii ) when the microlens crosses the outer part of the disk ( figures 5c , d and the right panel of fig .",
    "7 ) and in case ( iv ) when the microlens crosses the inner part of the disk ( see fig . 6 and the left panel of fig .",
    "however , in none of the figures does the continuum remain strictly constant during a complete fe k@xmath0 microlensing event . in the most favorable case ( the inner fe k@xmath0 disk plus an outer continuum annulus ; fig .",
    "6 and 7 ) we achieve a significant and relatively quick change of the fe k@xmath0 emission while the continuum experiences only a slow increase . this behavior could well approximate a non - varying continuum but only if we consider observations in a temporal window that fall on the peak of the microlensing event in the fe k@xmath0 line . in this case",
    "the continuum of the microlensed image experiences an ( slowly changing or almost constant ) amplification with respect to the continua of the other images , but practically it is indistinguishable from the amplifications due to global macrolensing .      here",
    "we consider a situation where a low mass population of microlenses ( smaller than one solar mass ) can form pattern structures ( see table 1 ) which are comparable with the size of the x - ray accretion disk .",
    "moreover , the black hole mass of the lensed quasar may be of the order of @xmath77 , taking that @xmath78 , the pattern structure of low mass microlenses are comparable with a x - ray disk size of several dozens r@xmath3 . therefore , here we consider that the black hole mass of the lensed quasar is @xmath79 .    for modeling of the caustic magnification pattern for image q2237 + 0305a we used the same values for the convergence and external shear as presented in figure 2 , but for a low mass population , taking that the mass of the deflectors are randomly distributed in an interval ranging from 0.1 @xmath64 to 0.6 @xmath64 , with a mean value of @xmath80 .",
    "also , the positions of the lenses were distributed randomly in a rectangular region in the lens plane , significantly larger than the considered region in the source plane .",
    "now , @xmath81 projected in the source plane corresponds to    @xmath82 where @xmath83pc is the projected err for a solar mass deflector , @xmath44 is the mean mass of the deflectors and @xmath84 is the black - hole mass . taking the mean deflector mass as @xmath80 and @xmath85 pc , we modeled a caustic magnification pattern of 1err@xmath862err , that corresponds to 334.63r@xmath87669.26@xmath30 in the source plane for a black hole mass of @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "9 ) . for numerical reasons ,",
    "the microlens magnification map is given in pixels , 1000@xmath862000 ( 1pix=0.33463r@xmath3 in source plane ) .",
    "as one can see from figure 9 , the microlensing pattern structures are comparable with a compact x - ray accretion disk .    in our previous modeling based on the straight fold caustic approximation the lack of a correlation between the continuum and fe k@xmath0 line is expected only if the line and x - ray continuum region are separated .",
    "recent investigations of the fe k@xmath0 line profile from active galaxies show that the line should be emitted from the innermost part of the accretion disk .",
    "in particular , ballantyne & fabian ( 2005 ) found that in blrg 4c+74.26 the outer radius of the relativistic iron line should be within 10 r@xmath3 .",
    "consequently , here we will assume that the fe k@xmath0 line is formed in the innermost part of the disk ( @xmath89 ; @xmath90 r@xmath91 ) and that the continuum ( emitted in the energy range between 0.1 kev and 10 kev ) is mainly originated from a larger region ( @xmath92 r@xmath91 ; @xmath93 r@xmath91 ) .",
    "r@xmath91 to @xmath93 r@xmath91 , we neglected the contribution of the innermost part emission ( from r@xmath94 to 20 r@xmath3 ) to the total continuum flux only in the energy interval from 0.1 kev to 10 kev .",
    "it does not mean that there is no the continuum emission . ] on the other hand , from the straight fold caustic modeling we conclude that the correlation between the total line and continuum flux due to microlensing is not very different for different emissivity laws .",
    "consequently , here we used the black - body emissivity law . a disk ( schwarzschild metric ) with an inclination of 35@xmath95 is considered .    to explore the line and x - ray continuum variation we moved the disk center along the microlensing map as it is shown in figure 9 ( from left to the right corresponding 0 to 2000 pixels ) . in figure 10",
    "we present the corresponding total line and x - ray continuum flux variation . as one can see from figure 10 ,",
    "there is a global correlation between the total line and continuum flux during the complete path .",
    "however , the total continuum flux variation is smooth and has a monotonic change , while the total line flux varies very strongly and randomly .",
    "in fact , during some portion of the microlensing of the emission regions by the magnification pattern , we found the total fe k@xmath0 line flux changes , while the continuum flux remains nearly constant ( e.g. the position of the disk center between 1000 and 1200 pixels ) .",
    "this and the shapes of the line and continuum total flux amplification indicate that the observed microlensing amplification of the fe k@xmath0 in three lensed quasars may be explained if the line is originated in the innermost part of the disk and the x - ray continuum in a larger region .",
    "also , it seems that the contribution of the continuum emitted from the innermost part of the disk ( within 10 r@xmath3 ) to the total continuum ( in the energy interval from 0.1 to 10 kev ) flux is not significant .",
    "further observations are needed to provide more data which might be compared with our theoretical results .",
    "the influence of gravitational microlensing on the spectra of lensed qsos was discussed in several papers ( see popovi and chartas 2005 , and references therein ) . mainly , the color index was calculated as an indicator of the microlensing ( see e.g. wambsganss & paczynski 1991 , wyithe et al .",
    "2000 ) as well as amplified flux behaviors ( see yonehara et al .",
    "1998 , yonehara et al .",
    "1999 , takahashi et al .",
    "2001 ) of a disk , but the exact shape of the amplification as a function of wavelength ( or energy ) for a partly microlensed disk has not been calculated . here , taking into account that the emitters at different radii in the accretion disk have different temperatures ( see fig",
    ". 1 ) and make different contributions to the observed continuum flux at a given wavelength , we calculated the amplification as a function of observed energies . during a caustic crossing microlensing effects would depend on the location of the emitters and , consequently , would induce a wavelength dependence in the amplification .",
    "this dependence can be clearly appreciated in the spectra of figures 3 , 4 and 8 . in figures",
    "11ab-12ab we present the amplification as a function of the observed energies for an accretion disk with the characteristics given in  2.2.1 , with inner radius @xmath50 and outer radius @xmath96 , assuming caustic crossing along the rotation axis ( x ) .",
    "we have considered the black body ( fig .",
    "11ab ) and the modified black body ( fig .",
    "12ab ) emissivity laws for both schwarzschild and kerr metrics .",
    "as it can be seen in figures 11 - 12 the amplification is different for different observed energies .",
    "the amplification is higher for the hard x - ray continuum when the caustic crosses the central part of the disk ( see fig .",
    "12 ) . depending mainly on the caustic location and on",
    "the emissivity law selected the difference of the amplification in the energy range studied by us can be significant ( e.g. @xmath97% for very small mass microlenses , err=50@xmath30 , see figs .",

    "this effect could induce a noticeable wavelength dependent variability of the x - ray continuum spectrum during a microlensing event ( of even a 30% ) , providing a tool to study the innermost regions of accretion disks .",
    "we have developed a model of microlensing by a straight fold caustic of a standard accretion disk in order to discuss the observed enhancement of the fe k@xmath0 line in the absence of corresponding continuum amplification found in three lensed qsos .",
    "here we summarize several interesting results inferred from our straight fold caustic simulations .    1 - as expected both the fe k@xmath0 and the continuum may experience significant amplification by a microlensing event ( even for microlenses of very small mass ) .",
    "thus , the absence of adequate continuum amplification in the observed fe k@xmath0 microlensed qsos should be related to the structure of the accretion disk and/or the geometry of the event .",
    "2 - extending the outer radius of the distribution of fe k@xmath0 emitters does not result in any significant changes in our results .",
    "this is due to the radial dependence of the emissivity as expressed in the standard accretion disk model @xcite that concentrates the emission near the center of the black hole making negligible the contribution from the outer parts to the integrated flux . in principle",
    "we could consider other less steep emissivity laws that make the outer parts of the disk more important , however previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ) support the hypothesis of a strong emissivity gradient .",
    "3 - segregation of the emitters allows us to reproduce the fe k@xmath0 enhancement without equivalent continuum amplification if the continuum emission region lies interior to the fe k@xmath0 emission region or vice versa but only during limited time intervals .",
    "in fact , in none of the simulations does the continuum remain constant during a complete fe k@xmath0 microlensing event . in the case of an inner fe k@xmath0 disk plus",
    "an outer continuum annulus a significant change of the fe k@xmath0 emission is obtained while the continuum experiences only a very shallow gradient .",
    "this behavior could well approximate the detected non - varying continuum for observations covering only the peak of the fe k@xmath0 microlensing event .",
    "4 - we have also studied a more realistic case of microlensing by a caustic magnification pattern assuming a population of low mass deflectors . in this case",
    "we can successfully reproduce the observed lack of correlation between the x - ray continuum and fe k@xmath0 emission amplification only if the line and continuum emission regions are separated .",
    "an extreme case of segregation is that of the two component model for the continuum suggested in several papers ( see e.g. @xcite if the contribution of the disk component to the x - ray continuum were weak enough .",
    "5 - we have studied the chromatic effects of microlensing in the x - ray continuum and find that the dependence with wavelength of the amplification can induce , even for small mass micro - deflectors ( err=50@xmath30 ) , chromatic variability of about 30% in the observed energy range ( from 0.1 kev to 10 kev ) during a microlensing event .",
    "further observations of the lensed quasars in the x - ray are needed to confirm these results . in any case monitoring of gravitational lenses",
    "may help us to understand the physics of the innermost part of the relativistic accretion disks .",
