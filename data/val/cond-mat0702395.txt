    "the formalism of superstatistics ( statistics of a statistics ) , has recently been proposed by beck and cohen @xcite as a possible generalization of statistical mechanics .",
    "superstatistics arises as weighted averages of ordinary statistics ( the boltzmann factor ) due to fluctuations of one or more intensive parameter ( e.g. the inverse temperature ) .",
    "it considers a non - equilibrium system as traveling within its phase space which is partitioned into cells . within each cell ,",
    "the system is described by ordinary maxwell - boltzmann statistical mechanics , i.e. , its statistical distribution is the canonical one @xmath0 , but @xmath1 varies from cell to cell , with its own probability density @xmath2 .",
    "this formalism has been elaborated and applied successfully to a wide variety of physical problems , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "superstatistics has been applied to model systems with partially chaotic classical dynamics within the framework of random - matrix theory ( rmt ) in ref .",
    "it has provides a possible mechanism for the initial stage of transition of a system out of the state of chaos but fails to reproduce the poisson statistics that is believed to describe regular systems . in the standard rmt @xcite ,",
    "a chaotic system is modeled by an ensemble of random matrices that depends only on the symmetry of the system .",
    "for example , a system of spinless particles , which has a time - reversal symmetry is represented by a gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) .",
    "the joint distribution of matrix elements of the hamiltonian @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath4   , $ ] where tr is trace and @xmath5 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 is related to the square of the mean level density .",
    "this distribution is based on two main assumptions : ( i ) the matrix elements are independent identically - distributed random variables , and ( ii ) their distribution is invariant under unitary transformations . for most of the physical systems",
    ", however , the phase space is partitioned into regular and chaotic domains .",
    "these systems are known as mixed systems .",
    "attempts to generalize rmt to describe such mixed systems are numerous ; for a review see @xcite .",
    "most of these attempts are based on constructing ensembles of random matrices whose elements are independent but not identically distributed , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "thus , the resulting expressions are not invariant under base transformation .",
    "the superstatistical generalization follows another route .",
    "it keeps base invariance , but violates matrix - elements independence .",
    "the intuitive explanation for using superstatistics is based on the ansatz that the spectrum of the system under consideration is partitioned into small cells . within each cell ,",
    "the spectrum is described by an ordinary gaussian random - matrix ensemble , but ensemble parameter @xmath6 varies from cell to cell .. one may define the density of states constituting a single cell as a ` local density of states ' ( ldos ) proportional to@xmath7 .",
    "superstatistics assumes that ldos and thus the parameter @xmath6 is no more a constant parameter as in the original rmt , but allowed to fluctuate according to a distribution @xmath8 . the joint matrix - element distribution is represented as an average over @xmath4   $ ] with respect to the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the resulting distribution depends on the matrix elements in the form of tr@xmath9 , which is base independent as the corresponding distribution in ordinary rmt .",
    "the central question for superstatistics is how to choose the parameter distribution . in superstatistical thermodynamics ,",
    "one obtains tsallis statistics @xcite when the inverse temperature @xmath1 has a @xmath10 distribution , but this is not the only possible choice .",
    "beck and cohen give several other possible examples of functions which are possible candidates for @xmath2 .",
    "generalized entropies , which are analogous to the tsallis entropy , can be defined for these general superstatistics @xcite .",
    "sattin @xcite suggested that , lacking any further information , the most probable realization of @xmath2 will be the one that maximizes the shannon entropy .",
    "this latter approach was used in @xcite to estimate the distribution @xmath8 of the parameter @xmath6 of rmt .",
    "the object of the present paper is to find out whether the local density of states defined above is related to the local spectral density of states ( in the literature , also ldos ) which is relevant to many practical applications in the field of condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "there , the notion of ldos follows from the conjecture that even in a metallic sample there is a finite probability to find almost localized  eigenstates so that the density of eigenstates is different at different locations in the sample . here",
    ", by localization we shall mean a situation , in which eigenfunctions are localized in the space of `` unperturbed '' eigenvalues on a scale which is significantly smaller than the size of the ensemble .",
    "indeed , the size of the region which is populated by an eigenfunction ( termed localization length ) measures the maximum number of basis state coupled by perturbation ( off - diagonal elements ) . in the state of chaos ,",
    "the localization length approaches the size of the ensemble , which means that the eigenfunctions become ergodic , i.e. , extended over the whole energy shell .",
    "then , the ldos coincides with the `` global '' density of states and both follow wigner s semicircular law .",
    "as the system departs from chaos , the localization length decreases and the ldos becomes distinguished from the global one .",
    "the main question , which we seek to answer is the following : can we benefit from the achievements of the well developed theory of disordered conductors in estimating the parameter distribution @xmath8 of the superstatistical ensemble ? \" instead of answering this question directly ( which is technically quite difficult ) , we compare the superstatistical distribution @xmath8 derived in @xcite from the principle of maximum entropy with the distribution of ldos deduced by altshuler and prigodin @xcite for disordered conductors .  after a brief review of our previous results , given in section",
    "ii , we show in section iii that the two distributions have similar shapes especially near the chaotic limit .",
    "the distribution @xmath8 is compared with the distribution of ldos obtained in the numerical simulation of the closed wire @xcite .",
    "while the agreement of the superstatistical distribution with the numerical experiment is not completely satisfactory , it still demonstrates the analogy between the notions of ldos in the two disciplines .",
    "section iv shows by comparison with a numerical experiment @xcite that the level - density distribution obtained for a random wire can be used as a parameter distribution in the superstatistical random matrix theory .",
    "the conclusion of this work is formulated in section v.",
    "for the sake of completeness and clarity , we recall the derivation of the superstatistical model introduced in @xcite . rmt models the hamiltonian of a chaotic system in terms of an ensemble of random matrices , whose matrix elements have a gaussian probability density distribution @xmath11   .\\ ] ] the mean level density for a goe with a large dimension @xmath12 is given by wigner s semi - circle law @xcite@xmath13   ^{1/2}~\\theta(1-\\eta\\varepsilon^{2}/n),\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the eigenvalue of @xmath3  and @xmath15 is the heaviside step function . in practical calculations with goe , one usually avoids the ends of the spectrum and works in a region with a nearly constant level density equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the superstatistical generalization models the quantum - number space of a system of mixed regular - chaotic dynamics as made up of many smaller cells that are temporarily in a chaotic phase .",
    "each cell is large enough to obey the statistical requirements of rmt but has a different distribution parameter @xmath6 associated with it , according to a probability density @xmath17 .",
    "consequently , the superstatistical random - matrix ensemble describes the mixed system as a mixture of gaussian ensembles .",

    "here we use the b - type superstatistics  @xcite . the parameter @xmath6 may be expressed in terms of the local mean level spacing @xmath20",

    "( 2 ) .    in the new framework of rmt provided by superstatistics , the local mean spacing @xmath20",
    "is no longer a fixed parameter but it is a stochastic variable with probability distribution @xmath24 .",
    "instead , the observed mean level spacing is just its expectation value .",
    "the fluctuation of the local mean spacing is due to the correlation of the matrix elements which disappears for chaotic systems . in the absence of these fluctuations , @xmath25 and we obtain the standard rmt . within the superstatistics framework , we can express  any statistic @xmath26 of a ( sufficiently chaotic ) mixed system that can in principle be  obtained from the joint eigenvalue distribution by integration over some of the eigenvalues , in terms of the corresponding statistic @xmath27 for a gaussian random ensemble with mean level spacing @xmath20 .",
    "the superstatistical generalization is given by @xmath28 the remaining task of superstatistics is the computation of the distribution @xmath24 .",

    ", the most probable realization of @xmath24 will be the one that extremizes the shannon entropy @xmath29 with the following constraints : * * ( * * i ) the major parameter of rmt is @xmath6 defined in eq .",
    "superstatistics was introduced in eq .",
    "( 3 ) by allowing @xmath6 to fluctuate around a fixed mean value @xmath30 .",
    "this requires the existence of the mean inverse square of @xmath20 , @xmath31 ( ii ) the fluctuation properties are usually defined for unfolded spectra , which have a unit mean level spacing .",
    "we thus require @xmath32 as a result , we obtain @xmath33\\ ] ] where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are parameters , which can be expressed in terms of the lagrange multipliers of the constrained extremization , and @xmath36 is a normalization constant . substituting this distribution into eq .",
    "( 5 ) one obtains expressions for the ( global ) level density , the nearest - neighbor - spacing ( nns ) distribution and the two - level correlation function @xcite .",
    "( 5 ) has recently been applied @xcite to obtain a generalization of the well - known porter - thomas distribution of transition intensities , relevant for chaotic regimes , for systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",

    "localization of wave functions by disorder can be seen in the fluctuations of the density of states , which can be probed using the tunnel resistance of a point contact .",
