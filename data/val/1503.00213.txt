    "a diffusion process is deemed nonlocal when the associated underlying lvy process does not only consist of brownian motions .",
    "the features of nonlocal diffusion has been verified experimentally to be present in a wide variety of applications , including , e.g. , contaminant flow in groundwater , plasma physics , and the dynamics of financial markets .",
    "a comprehensive survey of nonlocal diffusion problems is given in @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider a partial - integral diffusion equation ( pide ) representation @xcite of linear nonlocal diffusion problems .",
    "since it is typically difficult to obtain analytical solutions of such problems , numerical solutions are highly desired in practical applications .",
    "there are mainly two types of numerical methods for nonlocal diffusion equations under consideration .",
    "the first is the family of deterministic approaches , e.g. ,  finite - element - type methods @xcite and collocation methods , whereas the second can be classified as stochastic approaches , e.g. , continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) methods @xcite .",
    "the deterministic approaches are extensions of existing methods for local partial differential equations ( pdes ) that incorporate schemes to discretize the underlying integral operators .",
    "the recently developed nonlocal vector calculus @xcite provides helpful tools that allow one to analyze nonlocal diffusion problems in a similar manner to analyzing local pdes ; see @xcite for details .",
    "however , in the context of implicit time - stepping schemes , the nonlocal operator may result in severe computational difficulties coming from the dramatic deterioration of the sparsity of the stiffness matrices required by the underlying linear systems . on the other hand , stochastic approaches , e.g. , ctrw methods ,",
    "are based on the relation between nonlocal diffusion and a class of lvy jump processes .",
    "although stochastic methods do not require the solution of linear systems , and the simulations of all paths of the random walk can be easily parallelized , they also have some drawbacks .",
    "typically , most stochastic methods are sampling - based monte carlo approaches , suffering from slow convergence , thus requiring a very large number of samples to achieve small errors .",
    "even worse , in the case of a general nonlinear forcing term , the nonlocal diffusion equation is no longer the master equation of the underlying jump processes .    in this paper , we propose a novel stochastic numerical scheme for the linear nonlocal diffusion problems studied in @xcite based on the relationship between the pides and a certain class of backward stochastic differential equations ( bsdes ) with jumps . the existence and uniqueness of solutions for nonlinear bsdes with and without jumps",
    "have been proved in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . since then , bsdes have become important tools in probability theory , stochastic optimal control and mathematical finance @xcite .",
    "unlike bsdes driven by brownian motions , there are very few numerical schemes proposed for bsdes with jumps , and most of the schemes are focussed on time discretizations only .",
    "for example , a numerical scheme based on picard s method was proposed in @xcite , and a forward euler scheme was proposed in  @xcite where the convergence rate was proved to be @xmath1 .",
    "our focus will be on the bsdes corresponding to nonlocal diffusion equations with _",
    "integrable _ jump kernels in unbounded domains .",
    "since the pides of interest do not possess local convection and diffusion terms , the corresponding bsdes can be simplified , such that , the underlying lvy processes are merely _ compound poisson processes_. also , motivated by various engineering applications discussed in @xcite , our goal is to develop and analyze computationally efficient numerical schemes that can achieve high - order accuracy in both temporal and spatial discretization , rather than focus on the scalability of our schemes in solving extremely high - dimensional problems ( e.g. , in option pricing ) . from this perspective , although the bsdes under consideration is a special case of the equations studied in @xcite , high - order fully - discrete schemes and the corresponding error analysis are still missing in the literature .",
    "in fact , based on our previous work , it is particularly challenging to recover the classic finite element convergence rates in the spatial discretization , even for the simplified bsdes .",
    "thus , the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * development of stable high - order matrix - free numerical schemes for the bsdes and the corresponding nonlocal diffusion problems ; * analysis of the approximation error of the proposed semi - discrete and fully - discrete schemes , and ; * numerical demonstration of the capabilities of handling multiple types of integrable kernels , e.g. , symmetric , non - symmetric , or singular kernels .",
    "specifically , the bsdes will be discretized , in the temporal domain , using a @xmath0-scheme extended from our previous works @xcite for bsdes without jumps .",
    "in particular , the cases where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to forward euler , crank - nicolson and backward euler schemes , respectively . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "a quadrature rule adapted to the underlying stochastic processes is critical to approximate all the conditional mathematical expectations in our numerical scheme .",
    "thus , we propose a general formulation of the quadrature rule for estimating the conditional expectations with respect to the compound poisson processes , and a specific form of a certain pide can be determined based on regularities of the kernel and forcing term . in  [ sec : ex ] , gauss - legendre , gauss - jacobi and newton - cotes rules are substituted into the proposed quadrature rule to approximate different kernels and forcing terms . in addition , since the total number of quadrature points grows exponentially with the number of time steps , we construct a piecewise lagrange interpolation scheme based on a pre - determined spatial mesh , in order to evaluate the integrand of the expectations at all quadrature points .    both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments",
    "show that our approach is advantageous for linear nonlocal diffusion equations with integrable kernels on unbounded domains . compared to deterministic approaches , e.g. ,",
    "finite elements and collocation approaches , _ the proposed methods do not require the solution of dense linear systems_. instead , the pide can be solved independently at different spatial grid points on each time level , making it straightforward to incorporate parallel implementation and adaptive spatial approximation .",
    "compared to stochastic approaches , our scheme is more accurate than the ctrw method due to the use of the @xmath0-scheme for time discretization , the high - order quadrature rule , and piecewise lagrange polynomial interpolation for spatial discretization . in addition , our method can handle a broad class of problems with general nonlinear forcing terms as long as they are globally lipchitz continuous .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : nlocbsde ] , we introduce the mathematical description of the linear nonlocal diffusion equations and the corresponding class of bsdes under consideration . in  [ sec : scheme ] , we propose our numerical schemes for the bsdes of interest , where the semi - discrete and the fully - discrete approximations are presented in  [ sec : semi ] and  [ sec : fully ] , respectively .",
    "error estimates for the proposed scheme are proved in  [",
    "sec : err ] .",
    "extensive numerical examples and comparisons to existing techniques are given in ",
    "[ sec : ex ] , which are shown to be consistent with the theoretical results and reveal the effectiveness of our approach .",
    "finally , several concluding remarks are given in ",
    "[ sec : con ] .",
    "this section is dedicated to describing the nonlocal diffusion problem that is the focus of this paper . in particular , in  [ sec : nloc1 ] we introduce the definitions of a general nonlocal operator and diffusion equation .",
    "the relationship between the backward kolmogorov equation , which is a generalization of the nonlocal diffusion equation of interest , and the bsde with jumps , is described in  [ sec : bsde ] . based on this equivalence , a simplified bsde corresponding to the nonlocal diffusion problem of  [ sec : nloc1 ]",
    "is also given at the end of  [ sec : bsde ] .",

    "our interest in the operator @xmath8 is due to its participation in the _ nonlocal diffusion equation _ @xmath24 \\times \\mathbb{r}^d\\\\ & u(0,{\\bm{x } } ) = u_0({\\bm{x } } ) , \\text { for } { \\bm{x}}\\in \\mathbb{r}^d,\\\\ \\end{aligned}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the initial condition and the forcing term @xmath26 may be a _ nonlinear",
    "_ function of @xmath27 and @xmath20 .",
    "we remark that is a nonlocal cauchy problem defined on the _ unbounded _ spatial domain @xmath28 .",
    "also , in the context of kernel functions @xmath13 that are compactly supported in @xmath28 , the initial - boundary value nonlocal problem with _ volume constraints _ ,",
    "i.e. , constraints applied on a regions of nonzero measure in @xmath28 , has been well studied @xcite .",
    "however , the well - posedness of the corresponding bsdes with volume constraints is still an open challenge . as such",
    ", we do not impose volume constraints to in this effort .",
    "now we discuss the probabilistic representation of the solution of the nonlocal diffusion equation in .",
    "the nonlinear feynman - kac formula studied in @xcite shows that bsdes driven by brownian motion provides a probabilistic representation of the solutions of a class of second - order quasi - linear parabolic pdes .",
    "this result was extended in @xcite to the case of bsdes driven by general lvy processes with jumps . due to the inclusion of lvy jumps , the counterpart of a bsde is a partial integral differential equation ( pide ) , i.e. , the backward kolmogorov equation @xcite .",
    "it turns out that such a pide is a generalization of the nonlocal diffusion equation in . here",
    "we first introduce a general form of a bsde with jumps and the backward kolmogorov equation , then give a simplified form of the bsde corresponding to the nonlocal diffusion equation under consideration .",
