    "edison s invention of direct current ( dc ) preceeded tesla s invention of alternating current ( ac ) . however , once there were two possible modes of power available , an inevitable debate on the merits and demerits of the two started that led to what is called the `` war of currents '' .",
    "the inventor s became adversaries with edison promoting direct current ( dc ) for electric power distribution over the alternating current ( ac ) .",
    "the `` war of currents '' got so bitter that both inventors lost a lot of money and rumors have it , their nobel prize @xcite .    today",
    "the debate is more or less resolved with ac being accepted as the best method for electric power distribution , especially where the power requirement is large .",
    "it can be appreciated that since direct current can not be trivially stepped up or stepped down , the same voltage level is transmitted as required by the load .",
    "this resulted in large transmission losses .",
    "transmission loss takes place due to heat dissipation along the current carrying wires used for delivering power from generation point to consumer .",
    "the initial transmission networks laid were of copper , which is one of the best conductors with low resistivity . even with low resitivity , since the length of the transmission wires involved are large , they offered finite and non - negligiable resitance . thus introducing power loss during transmission .",
    "mathematically power dissipated is gien as @xmath0 where i , @xmath1 , l and a are the rms ( root mean square ) current , wire s resistivity , it s length and cross - sectional area respectively .",
    "thus , for transmitting a given power with minimum power loss , one would have to reduce the current while increasing the voltage .",
    "this is exactly what a transformer does for ac .",
    "thus for dc , transmission loss can only be minimised by using thicker copper wires . in turn",
    ", only fairly low dc power can be transmitted . since ,",
    "ac power can be stepped - up and down easily using transformers , the issue of transmission loss over thinner wires can be economically addressed .    with industrialization and increasing demands for higher levels of power ,",
    "even a ac distribution is not enough .",
    "hence , today distribution has moved to polyphase ( m ) distribution .",
    "polyphase voltages are also ac voltages but made up of multiple sinosudial varying voltages .",
    "of the possible polyphases , the three - phase supply is the most popular .",
    "it refers to three voltages that differ in phase by @xmath2 degrees from each other .",
    "the voltages go through their maxima in a regular order , after every @xmath3 .",
    "the phase sequence are named ` a ' , ` b ' and ` c ' .    0.5 cm 0.5 cm",
    "the three phases are generally distributed using three wires .",
    "the phases are separated or collected at the load side using special transformers , called `` star '' or `` delta '' transformers ( fig  1a ) .",
    "each wire has the same current carrying capability as in case of single phase supply .",
    "however , the power delivered at the load can be far greater depending on how the two potential levels are selected .",
    "consider , in the star transformer the load is connected between point ` a ' and neutral ( fig  1b ) the output waveform would be that of phase a , with the neutral point acting as ` zero potential ' point .",
    "the power delivered to the load is @xmath4 .",
    "however , if the load is connected between point ` a ' and ` b ' , the net potential difference can be found ( first in general ) from    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the peak voltage and @xmath7 the phase difference between the two phases . for a 2-phase supply ,",
    "where the phase difference between the two waveforms is @xmath8 , the potential difference would be @xmath9 this mathematics is graphically represented in fig  2 .",
    "it can be appreciated that the power delivered to the load now would be @xmath10 .",
    "this example shows how polyphase transmissions delivers more power .    while these are important issues to be appreciated by a physicist setting up a laboratory with instruments that require high power , schools and colleges do not help develop this concept with hand - on experimentation for fear of possible accidents that could even prove fatal .",
    "while kits are present in engineering colleges for electrical engineering , not much is found in the literature in way of simple experiemnts for physics and electronics students . in this direction , we have designed and tested a simple circuit , where two phases are generated from a sinusodial wave taken from a function generator .",
    "the proposed circuit requires three opamps , of which the first opamp is assembled in an inverting configuration @xcite . the sinusodial input from a function generator ( shown in fig  3 as ` 1 ' ) is given as an input to this inverting amplifier .",
    "this signal also acts as one of the 3 phases , namely phase a. the gain of this amplifier is kept as unity with @xmath11 .",
    "this circuit acts as a buffer preventing any loading by successive circuits and introduces a phase change of @xmath8 between output and input waveforms ( as indicative of the name `` inverting '' amplifier ) .",
    "the rc circuit is designed to introduce a phase difference of @xmath3 for the selected frequency . however ,",
    "a single combination of rc can at the most introduce a phase difference equal to or less than @xmath12 .",
    "hence , two sections are used , with each rc section introducing a phase shift of @xmath13",
    ". the values of r and c are selected using the formula @xcite @xmath14    _ in our study , for an 5khz wave provided from the function generator , we selected @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "_ hence points ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' of the circuit would be @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively out of phase with respect to the input .",
    "the impedence networks act as potential dividers and hence the voltage levels at ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' would be lower than that given as input . since the three phases would have the same amplitude , the signals at ` 3 ' and `",
    "4 ' would have to be amplified .",
    "we use as inverting amplifier again for point ` 4 ' .",
    "the voltage gain of this amplifier is give by @xmath19 .",
    "hence , @xmath20 has to be varied till the voltage signals amplitude is identical to the input signal .",
    "also , this inverting amplifier introduces a phase change of @xmath8 . the net phase difference",
    "hence would be @xmath21 which is nothing but a phase difference of @xmath22 .",
    "the output of this op amp circuit would be phase ` b ' .",
    "similar amplitude correction is required for the wave collected at point ` 3 ' . however , here we select a non - inverting amplifier circuit whose gain is given as @xmath23 and as the name suggests does not introduce any further phase shifts _ ( @xmath20 and @xmath24 used were @xmath25 pots and typically had values greater than @xmath26)_. hence , the net shift at the output remains the same as that at point ` 3 ' at @xmath27 or @xmath28 .",
    "this is phase c of the simulated 3-phase supply .",
    "fig  4 shows the waveforms ( phase a and c ) as captured by picoscope ( model 2202 ) .",
    "since the model only gives dual trace , only two waves can be shown simultaneously . however , the data captured by picoscope shows all three phases simultaneously .",
    "curve fitting these data points give the phase difference between the various phases to be 1.95radians or @xmath29 . also , the peak voltage ( @xmath6 ) also works out to be 1.58v .    while the circuits achieves the purpose of mimicing a 3-phase supply ,",
    "experiments can be done to further understand applications of 3-phase supply .",
    "for example , one can study the rectification and advantage of generating dc from 3-phase supply .",
    "for this , all one needs is 3 diodes and a load resistance ( see fig  5 ) .",
    "the output waveform is dc and also notice even without any filtering circuit , the output is continuous with little ripple .",
    "this is because , as seen by the load , the input frequency is three times that of a single phase supply .",
    "the ripples in a rectified output is inversely proportional to the frequency @xcite , hence the low ripples here can be understood .",
    "also , this output gives visual idea and helps in easier understanding that each phase in a 3-phase supply is separated by @xmath3 . in this rectifier circuit , only that diode conducts , for which the phase connected to it has the highest instantaneous potential with respect to the neutral .",
    "fig  4 shows one phase to have highest potential with repect to the other phases for @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in one cycle ( @xmath30 ) there would be three peaks of the output dc wave .",
    "this is visiable in fig  5 .",
    "a simple circuit has been proposed to demonstrate the behaviour of 3-phase power distribution .",
    "the simple circuit discussed in this article cost rs ( indian rupee ) 20/- to assemble ( less than a dollar ) and can be a very usual experiment in schools and under - graduate laboratorys to learn more about 3-phase supply and it s application .",
    "the financial support of u.g.c ( india ) in the form of minor research project no.f.6 - 1(25)/2007(mrp / sc / nrcb ) is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "the authors would like to express their gratitude to the lab technicians of the department of physics and electronics , s.g.t.b .",
    "khalsa college , for the help rendered in carrying out the experiment ."
