    "grb  050904 was triggered on 2005 september 4 , and found to be the highest redshift ( @xmath8 ) gamma - ray burst ( grb ) known to date @xcite . in order to search for the host galaxy of grb  050904 , we carried out imaging of the field of grb  050904 with suprime - cam on the subaru 8.2-m telescope under the photometric conditions on 2005 december 28 - 2006 january 3 ( ut ) , when it was 115 days after the burst .",
    "we used a narrow - band ( 130  ) filter centered at 9200   ( hreafter , nb921 ) and the @xmath0-band filter .",
    "although nb921 has narrow width , it has two merits .",
    "it does not include ly break and covers only the continuum light of an object at @xmath9 .",
    "the sky background at 9200    is lower than the surrounding region because oh sky emission lines are weaker at that integration .",
    "the @xmath0-band images were taken to discriminate foreground galaxies .",
    "the integration times were 56700 s in the nb921 , and 24060 s in the @xmath0-band .",
    "the circle indicates the grb position and its diameter is @xmath4 .",
    "the arrow indicates an object located @xmath10 south of the grb .",
    "( _ left _ ) the nb921 image .",
    "( _ right _ ) the @xmath0-band image .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] .",
    "the circle indicates the grb position and its diameter is @xmath4 .",
    "the arrow indicates an object located @xmath10 south of the grb .",
    "( _ left _ ) the nb921 image .",
    "( _ right _ ) the @xmath0-band image . , title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    the nb921 and @xmath0-band images of the field of grb  050904 ( @xmath11 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the limiting magnitudes ( @xmath12 , 3@xmath5 ) are 26.4 ab mag . in the nb921 , and 27.2 ab mag . in the @xmath0-band .",
    "no object ( @xmath13 ) is found at the position of the grb . the nearest object located at @xmath2 ne",
    "is clearly detected at both the nb921 and @xmath0-band image .",
    "this fact means that no ly break exists in the objects s spectrum at 8500  , and that its redshift is smaller than 6 .",
    "the limiting magnitude of 26.4 mag at 9210   corresponds to the luminosity of @xmath6 erg / s / hz at 1260   assuming @xmath14 km / s / mpc , @xmath15 , @xmath16 . assuming a flat spectrum of the host galaxy",
    ", we used the following relation @xcite to estimate the star formation rate : @xmath17 the upper limit of the star formation rate is 7.5 m@xmath7/year .",
    "this value is consistent with the one estimated by @xcite using @xmath18 data .",
    "this moderate star formation rate is similar to those of lower redshift grb host galaxies  @xcite .    in the nb921 image an object ( @xmath19 , 26.6 mag )",
    "is located at @xmath10 south of the grb .",
    "this object is also detected in the @xmath18 @xmath20-band image  @xcite , however , it is not detected in the @xmath0-band image .",
    "these facts suggest that its possible redshift is larger than 6 .",
    "the separation of @xmath10 between the object and the grb corresponds to 28 kpc ( @xmath14 km / s / mpc , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "threfore , it may reside in the same dark halo where the grb occurred ."
