    "interactions between charged objects in solution are determined by the distribution of ions around them .",

    ", much interest has been devoted to correlation effects in ionic solutions and to attempts to go beyond mean field theory in their treatment .",
    "in particular it has been realized that such effects can lead to attractive interactions between similarly charged objects , as was demonstrated in theoretical models @xcite , simulation @xcite and experiment @xcite .    despite the theoretical interest in ion correlation effects , they are not fully understood even in the most simple model for a charged object surrounded by its counterions , shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "the charged object in this model is an infinite planar surface localized at the plane @xmath0 , having a uniform charge density @xmath1 .",
    "the charged plate is immersed in a solution of dielectric contact @xmath2 and is neutralized by a single species of mobile counterions ( there is no salt in the solution ) .",
    "these counterions are confined to the half space @xmath3 and each one of them carries a charge @xmath4 , which is a multiple of the unit charge for multivalent ions .",
    "the ions are considered as point - like , _ i.e. _ , the only interactions in the system , apart from the excluded volume at @xmath5 , are electrostatic .",
    "the system described above is characterized by a single dimensionless coupling parameter @xcite , conventionally defined for the two dimensional one component plasma ( see ref .",
    "this parameter is related to @xmath6 as follows : @xmath7 . ]",
    "@xmath8 where @xmath9 is the thermal energy . at small values of this coupling parameter",
    "the electrostatic interaction between ions is weak . as a result ,",
    "in the limit @xmath10 mean field theory is exact , as can be formally proved using a field - theory formulation of the problem @xcite",
    ". correlations between ions close to the charged plate play a progressively more important role with increase of the coupling parameter . from eq .",
    "( [ xidef1 ] ) one sees that this happens with an increase of the surface charge , with decrease of the temperature or dielectric constant , and with increase of the charge or , equivalently , the valency of counterions .",
    "the model of fig .  1 thus provides an elementary theoretical framework for studying ion correlation effects near charged objects , with no free parameters other than @xmath6 , which tunes and controls the importance of ion correlations .    in recent years",
    "two theoretical approaches were proposed for treatment of the strong coupling limit @xmath11 .",
    "the first approach @xcite is based on properties of the strongly coupled , two dimensional one component plasma , and emphasizes the possibility of wigner crystal like ordering parallel to the charged plane .",
    "the second approach @xcite is formally an exact , virial type expansion applied to a field - theory formulation of the partition function .",
    "both of these approaches predict an exponential decay of the ion density distribution in the strong coupling limit , leading to a more compact counterion layer than in mean field theory .",
    "although the form of the density profile is established in the two limits @xmath10 and @xmath11 , its behavior at intermediate values of the coupling parameter is still not clear .",
    "liquid - state theory approaches such as the ahnc approximation @xcite can probably be used in this regime , but in practice they were applied in the literature only to relatively small values of the coupling parameter , usually also including ingredients other than those in the model of fig .  1  such as finite ion size , added salt , or an interaction between two charged planar surfaces",
    ". the infinite planar double layer with no added salt ( fig .",
    "1 ) was recently studied using monte - carlo computer simulation @xcite , providing detailed results on the counterion distribution in a wide range of coupling parameter values .",
    "these results validate the expected behavior in the weak and strong coupling limits .",
    "in addition they provide new data at intermediate values of the coupling parameter , to which theoretical approaches can be compared .",
    "we propose , in the present work , a new theoretical approach for treating the distribution of counterions near the charged plate .",
    "this approach is based on an approximate evaluation of the response of the ionic layer , to the presence of a single test particle .",
    "while an exact evaluation of this response would , in principle , allow the distribution of ions to be obtained exactly , we show that even its approximate calculation provides meaningful and useful results . in the limits of small and large @xmath6",

    ". we will first express the free energy using the dimensionless coupling parameter @xmath6 . in the canonical ensemble the partition function can be written as follows ( @xmath13 is the @xmath12 coordinate of the @xmath14-th ion ) : @xmath15 \\label{fnoscale}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the distance at which the coulomb energy of two ions is equal to the thermal energy @xmath9 , and @xmath17 characterizes the bare interaction of an ion with the charged plane .",
    "these quantities , the only two independent length scales in the problem , are known as the bjerrum length and gouy - chapman length , respectively .",

    "the local density of ions in the rescaled coordinates is equal to @xmath26 . due to symmetry",
    "this density depends only on @xmath27 and it is convenient to define a normalized , dimensionless , density per unit length:@xmath28 having the property : @xmath29 as seen from eqs .",
    "( [ densitynoscale ] ) and ( [ densityscaled ] ) . from here on we will omit the tilde symbol ( @xmath30 ) from all quantities , in order to simplify the notations . in order to express physical quantities in the original , non - scaled units ,",
    "the following substitutions can be used : @xmath31 we will also omit the subscript @xmath32 from the free energy @xmath33 , implying that @xmath32 is determined by charge neutrality .",
    "we briefly review some known properties of the ion distribution in the limits of small and large @xmath6 ( for a more complete discussion , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the limit of @xmath10 mean",
    "field theory becomes exact .",
    "the density profile is obtained from the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation and decays algebraically , having the form @xcite @xmath34 within the adsorbed layer ions form a three dimensional , weakly correlated gas : the electrostatic interaction between neighboring ions is small compared to the thermal energy .",
    "this last statement can be verified by considering the density of ions at contact with the plane , @xmath35 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ densityscaled ] ) and ( [ npb ] ) ) .",
    "the typical distance between neighboring ions is thus of order @xmath36 . in the non - scaled units this distance is much larger than @xmath37 , which validates the statement that ions are weakly correlated : @xmath38 .",
    "note also that this typical distance is small compared to the width of the adsorbed layer ( gouy - chapman length ) : @xmath39 .    in the opposite , strong coupling ( sc )",
    "limit of @xmath40 , the density profile decays exponentially , @xmath41 the width of the adsorbed layer is still of order @xmath42 in the non - scaled units , but is now small compared to @xmath37 .",
    "equation  ( [ densitynoscale ] ) indicates that the average lateral distance between ions is then of order @xmath43 .",
    "this distance is large compared to the width of the ionic layer , @xmath44 . on the other hand",
    "it is small in units of the bjerrum length : @xmath45 .",
    "the ions form , roughly speaking , a two - dimensional sheet and are highly correlated within this adsorbed layer . the typical lateral separation between ions , @xmath43 ,",
    "is an important length scale in the strong coupling limit , and will play an important role also in our approximated model .    at sufficiently large values of @xmath6",
    "it has been conjectured ( but not proved ) that ions form a two - dimensional , triangular close - packed wigner crystal parallel to the charged plate . based on the melting temperature of a two dimensional , one component plasma",
    ", one can estimate that this transition occurs at @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ion - ion correlation function is expected to display short range order similar to that of the wigner crystal even far below this transition threshold .",
    "the exponential decay of eq .",
    "( [ nsc ] ) was predicted , based on these notions , in ref .",
    "the same result can be obtained also in a formal virial expansion @xcite , which is valid for large @xmath6 but does not involve long range order parallel to the charged plate at any value of @xmath6 .    finally we note two general properties of the density profile that are valid at any value of @xmath6 .",
    "first , the normalized contact density @xmath47 is always equal to unity  a consequence of the contact theorem @xcite ( see also appendix  [ ap : contact ] ) .",
    "second , the characteristic width of the adsorbed layer is always of order unity in the rescaled units .",
    "these two properties restrict the form of the density distribution quite severely and indeed the two profiles ( [ npb ] ) and ( [ nsc ] ) are similar to each other close to the charged plane .",
    "far away from the plate , however , they are very different from each other : at @xmath48 the probability to find an ion is exponentially small in the sc limit , while in the weak coupling limit it decays only algebraically and is thus much larger . furthermore ,",
    "in the weak coupling case , moments of the density , including the average distance of an ion from the plate , diverge .",
    "although the form of the density profile is known in the limits of small and large @xmath6 , two important issues remain open .",
    "the first issue is the form of the density profile at intermediate values of @xmath6 . at coupling parameter values such as",
    "10 or 100 perturbative expansions around the limits of small or large @xmath6 @xcite are of little use , because they tend to give meaningful results only at small values of their expansion parameter .",
    "such intermediate values are common in experimental systems with multivalent ions , as demonstrated in table  1 .",
    "second , even at very small or very large @xmath6 the respective asymptotic form of @xmath49 may be valid within a limited range of @xmath12 values .",
    "in particular , for large @xmath6 it is natural to suppose that sufficiently far away from the charged plate the density profile crosses over from sc to pb behavior . indeed ,",
    "far away from the plate the ion density is small , resembling the situation near a weakly charged surface .",
    "the main objective of this work is to investigate these issues , both of which necessitate going beyond the formal limits of vanishing and infinite @xmath6 .",
    ".characteristic values of @xmath1 , @xmath42 and @xmath6 for several representative macromolecules",
    ". values of @xmath6 are shown for two cases : monovalent counterions ( 1-@xmath4 ) and @xmath50-valent ones ( 4-@xmath4 ) .",
    "the gouy - chapman length @xmath42 corresponds to monovalent ions .",
    "the cell membrane charge density is estimated assuming that 10% of the lipids in the membrane are charged .",
    "the surface charge of dna is estimated from the linear charge density along the dna contour , equal to @xmath51@xmath4/ , and assuming a radius of 10 . for mica full dissociation of charged groups",
    "is assumed .",
    "in all three cases the bjerrum length is taken as @xmath52 , which corresponds to water at room temperature . [",
