    "based on the particular properties of single quantum systems , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) promises cryptographic key exchange over an untrusted , authenticated public communication channel with information theoretic security @xcite .",
    "significant academic @xcite , and industrial effort @xcite has been devoted to the development of point - to - point ( p2p ) qkd systems based on attenuated laser pulses or entangled photons , and the first fully functional prototype of a quantum cryptographic network consisting of pre - established p2p links in a trusted node scenario has recently been demonstrated @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , various proof - of - principle demonstrations of quantum teleportation and quantum memory ( see @xcite and references therein ) have been reported , which will eventually allow building of fully quantum enabled networks @xcite , e.g. for perfectly secure communication in settings with un - trusted nodes and over large distances @xcite .    despite these remarkable achievements ,",
    "the building of a reconfigurable real - world qkd network still requires significant progress , even when limiting quantum communication to qubits encoded into faint laser pulses and to entangled qubits . among the issues to be solved",
    "is the necessity to route quantum data from any sender to any receiver .",
    "the possibility to use active optical switches to send quantum information to different users has first been demonstrated in 2003 @xcite .",
    "however , the question regarding the addition of sender and receiver addresses to the quantum data ( which is not required in pre - established p2p links ) has , to the best of our knowledge , never been addressed . beyond routing ,",
    "another requirement for quantum networks is path stabilization between sender and receiver , i.e. to ensure that carriers of qubits prepared at alice s arrive unperturbed at bob s .",
    "this includes control of the properties of the quantum channel , e.g. birefringence in an optical fibre , and the establishment of a common reference frame at alice s and bob s , e.g. a direction or a precise time - difference , depending on the property chosen to encode the qubit @xcite .",
    "current p2p qkd systems are either of the plug & play type and automatically stabilize the quantum channel @xcite , or achieve unperturbed quantum communication by adding from time to time short sequences of classical control information @xcite . however , neither method allows communication of the properties that are important in reconfigurable networks , including sender and receiver address , or the specific qkd protocol or type of qubit encoding chosen .    in this article",
    "we propose the use of quantum frames as a flexible framework for sensing , communicating and controlling the parameters relevant in a qkd network setting .",
    "our approach is sufficiently flexible to accommodate for current and future quantum technology or applications , including technology from different vendors , which is important in view of open quantum networks .",
    "we demonstrate the suitability of our solution for quantum key distribution with polarization qubits over a 12 km real - world fibre optic link .    this article is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we present the general idea of quantum frames .",
    "we then discuss the principle qkd setup ( section [ sec3 ] ) , and give further details of key components ( section [ sec4 ] ) . after presenting the properties of our fibre optics link ( section [ sec5 ] ) ,",
    "we describe the qkd field tests and discuss the results ( section [ sec6 ] ) , and then elaborate briefly on some issues related to the security of the key establishment ( section [ sec7 ] ) . in section [ sec8 ]",
    "we present the status of our classical post processing , required to distill a secret key , specifically the possibility of hardware implementation of one - way error correction .",
    "we present our conclusions in section [ sec9 ] .",
    "to add control functionalities to the communication between alice and bob , we propose supplementing the quantum data ( e.g. qubits ) with classical control frames . the control frames ( c - frame ) , encoded into strong laser pulses , alternate with the quantum data , and a pair of classical / quantum data forms a quantum frame ( q - frame ) , see .",
    "the c - frame allows synchronizing sender alice and receiver bob , facilitates time - tagging , and provides a platform to communicate sender and receiver address ( for routing or packet switching ) plus implementation specific information such as encoding ( e.g. polarization or time - bin qubit @xcite ) and protocol ( e.g. bb84 @xcite , decoy state @xcite , or b92",
    "this is interesting in view of open , reconfigurable networks comprising different qkd technologies .",
    "the classical information in our implementation is encoded into specific polarization states , allowing assessment and compensation of time - varying birefringence in the quantum channel .",
    "note that the compensation scheme can easily be adapted to other qkd setups employing e.g. time - bin qubits , entanglement , or quantum repeaters .",
    "furthermore , the c - frames can be used to asses channel loss , which may be important for routing .    ,",
    ", width=453 ]    our qkd system is based on polarization qubits , and employs the bb84 protocol  @xcite , supplemented with two decoy states  @xcite .",
    "it allows alternating sequences of strong and faint laser pulses , encoding classical data and quantum data , respectively .",
    "a simplified schematic of the qkd system is depicted in .",
    "alice uses two laser diodes to generate the classical data ( ld@xmath0 ) and the quantum data ( ld@xmath1 ) .",
    "the pulses emitted from ld@xmath1 are first attenuated by an optical attenuator ( att ) , and then sent through an intensity modulator ( i m ) to create signal and decoy states with different mean photon numbers . to create vacuum decoy states ,",
    "no electrical pulses are sent to ld@xmath1 .",
    "the horizontally polarized faint pulses are then transmitted through a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) , and combined with the strong , vertically polarized pulses from ld@xmath0 .",
    "all pulses are then sent to a polarization modulator ( pm ) , where horizontal ( h ) , vertical ( v ) , right ( r ) , or left ( l ) circular polarization states can be created .",
    "quantum and classical data is transmitted to bob through a quantum channel . at bob s end",
    ", 10% of the light is directed towards a fast photo detector ( pd ) followed by a logic device ( log ) .",
    "the detector and the logic device , which were not implemented in our investigation , will read the information encoded in the classical data and take appropriate action , e.g. for clock synchronization , optical routing , or communication of protocol specific information used by bob for the measurement and subsequent processing of the quantum data .",
    "the remaining light is split at a 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) , and directed to two polarization stabilizers ( ps1 , ps2 ) followed by polarization beam splitters ( pbs1 , pbs2 ) and single photon detectors ( spds ) .",
    "ps1 ensures that horizontally polarized classical data , and hence qubits , emitted at alice s arrive unchanged at pbs1 .",
    "similarly , ps2 is set up such that right circular polarized classical data and qubits emitted at alice s always impinge horizontally polarized on pbs2 . since the transformation in the quantum channel is described by a unitary matrix ( i.e. orthogonal states remain orthogonal ) , our stabilization scheme ensures that qubits prepared in h and v , or r and l states arrive horizontally and vertically polarized on pbs1 or pbs2 , respectively .",
    "hence , the two sets of ps , pbs and two spds both allow compensation of unwanted polarization transformations in the quantum channel , and projection measurements onto h , v , r and l , as required in the bb84 protocol .",
    "note that our scheme does not prevent h and v created at alice s from arriving in an arbitrary superposition of h and v at pbs2 ( similar for r and l at pbs1 ) .",
    "however , these cases do not cause errors as they are eliminated during key sifting .",
    "initially , we used a commercial linbo@xmath2 phase modulator ( pm ) and a mach - zehnder intensity modulator in a one - way configuration to achieve fast polarization and intensity modulation . shows the schematics of the polarization modulator , i.e. a phase modulator with polarization maintaining input fibre ( pmf ) whose slow axis is rotated 45 degrees ( r@xmath3 ) with respect to the optical axis of the modulator waveguide , and standard single mode output fibre ( smf ) .",
    "hence , horizontally polarized input light , which propagates parallel to the slow axis of the pmf , is split into two components , where each one propagates along one axis of the waveguide . by applying a control voltage to the phase modulator",
    ", a phase shift is introduced between the two components , resulting in a polarization modulation .",
    "unfortunately , the phase modulator features significant polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) for 500 ps long optical pulses resulting in a polarization extinction ratio ( per ) , i.e. the ratio between optical power in two orthogonal polarization states , of only 16 db . moreover , we found both the phase and intensity modulator to be temperature sensitive  a change of environmental temperature or heating caused by passing a current through the impedance matching resistance inside the modulators causes a variation of the polarization state , or the intensity level , of the output light .",
    "this would have a direct impact on the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) and stability of our qkd system .      to overcome these problems",
    ", we designed a  basic unit \" ( see ) consisting of a phase modulator ( pm ) with 45 degree rotated input pmf and a faraday mirror ( fm ) @xcite . as explained below , this allows building stable polarization and intensity modulators by means of a go - and - return configuration ( the light travels twice and in orthogonal polarization states through the phase modulator ) .    to explain how the basic unit works",

    "furthermore , all ( slow ) modifications of the polarization modulation due to changes in temperature or mechanical stress of the sm and pm fibres are automatically compensated .",
    "the output polarization state thus only depends on the modulation of the waveguide ( @xmath37 ) and the phase shift induced by the polarization maintaining fibre ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we complemented the basic unit to a polarization modulator by preceding it by a polarization maintaining circulator ( cir ) that allows separating the input and output optical pulses ( see ) . by applying appropriate , short voltage pulses , which are synchronized with the propagations of the optical pulse , to the phase modulator",

    "we obtained a polarization extinction ratio of 20 db for horizontal and vertical polarization states ( limited by the light source used to test the polarization modulator ) , see , and of 15 db for left and right circular polarization .",
    "we believe the reduced ratio to be caused by state dependent polarization mode dispersion in the circulator , which will be replaced in the near future .    ]",
    "similarly , we built an intensity modulator by preceding the basic unit by a pbs , as shown in .",
    "the pbs reflects the vertical component of the impinging light .",
    "hence , by varying the polarization state of the light at the output of the basic unit , we can vary the intensity of the vertical component at the output of the pbs .    the intensity extinction ratio , i.e. the ratio between the maximum and minimum intensity at the output of the pbs , exceeds 20 db ( see ) .",
    "moreover , as the phase , @xmath38 , does not impact on the output intensity , our modulator features an outstanding stability , as depicted in .",

    "the now vertically polarized weak laser pulses are combined with the horizontally polarized strong pulses from ld@xmath0 , which encode the c - frame , to form a complete q - frame .",
    "quantum and classical data is then sent through the polarization modulator , which is also presented in .",
    "the intensity and the polarization modulator are driven by a function generator ( fg2 ) with a pulse width of 4 ns .",
    "note that the polarization maintaining circulator ( cir ) that is part of the polarization modulator only allows horizontally polarized light to enter , while the pulses from ld@xmath0 and ld@xmath1 impinge with orthogonal polarization .",
    "therefore , we aligned the axes of the polarization maintaining fibre at the output of the pbs at 45 degrees with respect to the axes of the polarization maintaining fibre at the input of the circulator .",

    "we attribute the remaining discrepancy to a systematic error in the estimation of the single photon gain @xmath69 , resulting from a slightly wrong estimation of the transmission in the link , quantum efficiency of the detectors , or error rate due to wrongly received photons .",

    "indeed , we calculate @xmath72 , in very good agreement with our experimental results .",
    "to finish this discussion , we emphasize that the secret key rate in an actual implementation of an information - theoretic secure qkd session must be calculated using the decoy state method used in the third analysis and must not rely on assumptions about fair loss in the quantum channel .",
    "we have noted that each faint pulse that encodes a qubit is preceded by another faint pulse , originating from a reflection on the pbs that is part of the intensity modulator ( see section [ sec4 ] ) .",

    "obviously , for our assessment of the eavesdropper s information to be correct , we have to make sure that this pulse , which also transits through the polarization modulator , does not encode any polarization information .",
    "therefore , we have carefully adjusted the electrical trigger signal for the polarization modulator such that it only acts on the  real \" faint pulse , and not on the spurious one .        as in any qkd system , regardless whether it employs one - way or two - way quantum communication , appropriate measures have to be implemented to protect against trojan - horse attacks @xcite . in these attacks ,",
    "the eavesdropper injects light through the optical fibre into alice s or bob s preparation or measurement device , respectively , and analyzes the back reflection , which may reveal information about the quantum state created at alice s or the measurement basis to be used at bob s . in both cases ,",
    "the security of the key distribution would be compromised as eve either knows the state , or knows in which basis to perform an intercept resend attack without creating errors . in our qkd system ,",
    "given the static setup at bob s , trojan horse attacks have to be considered only at alice s . towards this end",
    ", a polarization independent optical isolator and a spectral filter that absorbs all wavelengths not blocked by the isolator should be placed at the output of alice s .      in a time - shift attack @xcite",
    "the eavesdropper exploits the fact that the detection efficiency of different detectors may , for a given arrival time of a photon , be different .",
    "it may thus be possible for an eavesdropper to bias the detection probabilities by actively time - shifting the arrival time of photons and thereby acquire information for each photon if it was detected in a detector that codes for a bit value 0 , or 1 .",
    "this attack , which is possible in our current system , can be overcome if bob randomly rotates the polarization state of each incoming qubit by 0 or @xmath73 , thereby de - correlating a detection in a particular detector with a particular bit value .",
    "this can be done by placing a rapidly variable @xmath74 waveplate in between the polarization stabilizer and the pbss , at the expense of rendering bob s setup  active \" , i.e. vulnerable to trojan horse attacks ( which then have to be protected against , as discussed above ) .",
    "once the quantum part of the qkd protocol is finished , alice and bob must perform a series of classical steps to go from the raw key to the secret key used for encryption @xcite .",
    "the steps required are shown in .",
    "in addition to sifting , error correction is used to ensure that alice and bob have an identical key despite any errors that occur .",
    "privacy amplification is then used to eliminate any information eve has obtained about the key , whether through eavesdropping on the quantum channel or on the classical communication used for error correction . these steps must also make use of authenticated communication to prevent eve from performing a man - in - the - middle attack . of these steps",
    ", error correction is expected to become the bottleneck in the qkd system once higher raw key rates are achieved .",

    "for example , suppose row @xmath87 of @xmath76 is a parity check on three bits received by bob , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 , where the expected qber is 10% ( chosen to prevent very small numbers in this example ) .",

    "<S> we propose a fibre - based quantum key distribution system , which employs polarization qubits encoded into faint laser pulses . as a novel feature </S>",
    "<S> , it allows sending of classical framing information via sequences of strong laser pulses that precede the quantum data . </S>",
    "<S> this allows synchronization , sender and receiver identification , and compensation of time - varying birefringence in the communication channel . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , this method also provides a platform to communicate implementation specific information such as encoding and protocol in view of future optical quantum networks . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate in a long - term ( 37 hour ) proof - of - principle study that polarization information encoded in the classical control frames can indeed be used to stabilize unwanted qubit transformation in the quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> all optical elements in our setup can be operated at gbps rates , which is a first requirement for a future system delivering secret keys at mbps . in order to remove another bottleneck towards a high rate system , we investigate forward error correction based on low - density parity - check codes . </S>"
