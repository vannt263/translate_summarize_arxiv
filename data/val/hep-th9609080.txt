    "a_a_n(_n ) [ ff ] ( the so  called form factors ( ff ) ) in a class of integrable two  dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "our specific aim is to check some new theoretical ideas which concern the relationships between three different regimes which two  dimensional quantum field theories may have , namely the ones ruled by conformal invariance , integrable or non  integrable dynamics .",
    "conformal field theories ( cft ) and the associated off - critical integrable models ( i m ) have been extensively studied in the last years : as a result of these analyses a good deal of information has been obtained particularly on correlation functions of a large number of statistical mechanical models in their scaling limit and on physical quantities related to them ( see for instance [ 1 - 8 ] ) . in this context , a crucial problem often consists in the determination of the spectrum of the scaling operators away from criticality , namely their correct identification by means of the set of their form factors .",
    "this is one of the issues addressed in this work .",
    "form factors also play a crucial role in estimating non  integrable effects .",
    "let us first recall that the above cft and i m regimes can not obviously exhaust all possible behaviours that statistical models and quantum field theories can have since typically they do not possess an infinite number of conservation laws .",
    "this means that in general we have to face all kinds of phenomena and complications associated to non  integrable models ( nim ) .",
    "the scattering amplitudes and the matrix elements of the quantum operators will have in these cases a pattern of analytic singularities due both to the presence of higher thresholds and to the appearance of resonances . a first step forward in their analysis has been recently taken in ref.@xcite where it has been shown that some interesting examples of nim may be obtained as deformations of integrable models .",
    "the action of such theories can correspondingly be written as = a_int + _ i_id^2 x _",
    "i(x ) , [ action ] @xmath0 being the action of the integrable model . since the exact expressions ( [ ff ] ) of the form factors of the integrable theories are all assumed calculable , in particular the ones of the fields @xmath1 entering eq.([action ] ) , one is inclined to study the non  integrable effects by using the born series based on the form factors .",
    "although at first sight this still remain a difficult task ( and generally , it is indeed so ) , there may be favorable circumstances where the analysis simplifies considerably .",
    "for instance , as far as there is only a soft breaking of integrability , it has been shown in @xcite that the complications of the higher terms in the series can often be avoided since the most relevant corrections only come from the lowest approximation .",
    "if this is the case , one can extract an important amount of information with relatively little effort : a significant set of physical quantities to look at is provided for instance by universal ratios , like the ones relative to the variations of the masses or of the vacuum energy density @xmath2 : if the breaking of integrability is realized by means of a single field @xmath3 , those are expressed by = , +   + = , [ nif ] where @xmath4 refers to the ( unperturbed ) mass spectrum of the original integrable theory .",
    "it is thus evident that also to estimate the non  integrable effects associated to a given operator @xmath3 one must face the problem of correctly identifying its ff s .    two new results on the relationship between cft and i m have been recently derived by delfino , simonetti and cardy @xcite",
    ". briefly stated , the first result consists in a new sum  rule which relates the conformal dimension @xmath5 of the operator @xmath6 to the off  critical ( connected ) correlator @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the trace of the stress  energy tensor ) may be violated by effect of renormalization of the operators outside the critical point , as clarified in the original reference @xcite .",

    "critical data , but more importantly , they provide very concrete and efficient tools to characterise the scaling limit of the off - critical models .    as for the second result , it has been suggested by the aforementioned authors of ref .",

    "cluster hypothesis _ is valid , we would have a clear method to identify the matrix elements of all the relevant operators , at least in the case of theories without symmetries .",
    "it must be stressed that until now this task has often been a matter of keen guess  work and mostly based on physical intuition .",
    "it turns out that a check of the above _ cluster hypothesis _ provides a well  suited forum for testing several theoretical aspects .",
    "in fact , the most direct way of confirming the above idea is firstly to solve the general functional equations of the form factors with the additional constraints of the cluster equations ( [ cluster ] ) and to see whether _ the number of independent solutions equals the number of relevant fields _ in the corresponding kac table . if the above check turns out to be positive , one may use the sum ",
    "rule ( [ sumrule1 ] ) in order to achieve the correct identification of the ( supposed ) primary relevant operators @xmath10 : from the values of the partial sums one can in fact infer the value of the anomalous dimension and correspondingly recognize the operator .",
    "an additional confirmation may also come from the employment of eqs.([nif ] ) relative to non ",
    "integrable field theories .",
    "in fact , one can regard the primary field @xmath11 under investigation as that operator which spoils the integrability of the original theory and therefore compare the predictions ( [ nif ] ) based on its form factors with their independent numerical determinations which may be obtained by means of the truncation method @xcite .",
    "note that a successful test of this kind could also be interpreted the other way around , namely as a further proof of the effectiveness of the formulas ( [ nif ] ) in estimating non  integrable effects .",
    "the models on which we have chosen to test the above considerations are integrable deformations of the first representatives of the non  unitary conformal series @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "they belong to the class of universality of solvable rsos lattice models _  la _ andrews ",
    " forrester although with negative boltzmann weigths @xcite : their simplest example is given by the quantum field theory associated to the so  called yang ",
    "lee model which describes the distribution of zeros in the grand canonical partition function of the ising model in a complex magnetic field @xcite .",
    "these models do not have any internal symmetry and all their fields are relevant operators : hence , they are ideal for our purposes .",
    "moreover , the nature of their massive and conformal phases is simple enough .",
    "the price to pay for their relative simplicity is however the presence of typical non  unitary phenomena , as imaginary coupling constants or negative values of the anomalous dimensions and central charge , together with the anomalous poles in the @xmath14matrix which induce an unusual analytic structure in the form factors @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we discuss the general strategy which can be employed in order to compute the ff s of the relevant operators in the integrable deformations of the models @xmath12 . in section 3 and 4 we present a detailed analysis of the ff s of the models @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which are the first non  trivial examples on which to check all the theoretical ideas discussed above .",
    "in fact , for the first model @xmath17 the _ cluster hypothesis _ is easily verified : the only solution of the form factor equations is the sequence of functions determined in ref .",
    "@xcite which indeed fulfill the cluster equations ( [ cluster ] ) and are easily identified with the matrix elements of the only relevant field of the yang  lee model .",
    "the two models @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent , somehow , the best playground for our purposes because they give rise to integrable models under each of their possible ( individual ) deformations and also because they optimize the size of the lenghty numerical output which we present for the solutions of the non  linear equations .",
    "moreover , although there is in principle no obstacle to extend the analysis to all the models @xmath12 , these are the simplest cases from a computational point of view since the larger is the value of the index @xmath18 the higher is the order of the system of algebraic equations to be solved for determining the form factors .",
    "finally , our conclusions are in section 5 .",
    "two appendices complete the paper : appendix a gathers all important formulas relative to the parameterization of the two  particle form factors and appendix b collects the @xmath14matrices of the models analysed .",
    "in this section we discuss the general strategy needed in order to obtain the form factors of the scaling primary fields of the integrable deformations @xmath19 of the conformal models @xmath20 ( hereafter denoted by the shorthand notation @xmath21_{(1,k)}$ ] ) .",
    "the deforming field @xmath19 can be one of the operators @xmath22 , @xmath23 or possibly some other primary field which gives rise to an integrable deformation .",
    "the starting point in the computation of the form factors is the correct parameterization of the two  particle ones which is given detailed in appendix a. this is a non ",
    "trivial task in the case of non  unitary models for the reason that the exact @xmath14matrices of these models are usually plagued by a pletora of anomalous poles @xcite . by this",
    "we mean for example simple poles which are not related to any bound state , or , more generally , any poles which do not have apparently the standard diagrammatic interpretation of refs.@xcite .",
    "consider for example the @xmath14matrices listed in the tables of appendix b relative to the integrable deformations of the models @xmath15 and @xmath16 where the anomalous poles have been labelled with @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 .",
    "the origin of these poles may be explained according to the ideas put forward in @xcite . in particular , poles of type @xmath24 and @xmath25 are due to multiparticle processes of the kind described respectively by the `` butterfly '' and `` dragonfly '' diagrams drawn in figures 2 and 3 respectively . these multi ",
    "loop processes induce in the @xmath14matrix simple poles rather than higher order ones because the internal lines of these diagrams cross at relative rapidity values relative to some zeros of their corresponding two ",
    "particle @xmath14matrix element : this gives rise to a partial cancellation of the poles .",
    "the adopted parameterization for two  particle ff s is directly related to the pole structure of the @xmath14matrix .",
    "this yields to the expression ( [ fab ] ) whose functional form is set except for the coefficients @xmath27 appearing in the expansion ( [ qgen ] ) of the polynomials @xmath28 .",
    "the degree @xmath29 of these polynomials is fixed by the asymptotic behavior of the ff s for large rapidities which depends , of course , on the field @xmath30 @xcite . for the case of two  particle ff s of cluster operators , it is easy to see that they are subject to have for large @xmath31 at most a constant limit .",

    "in order to fully determine the ff s of the cluster operators we have chosen to focus on the set of all one and two  particle ff s .",
    "listing all the relations among them , one obtains a system of equations in the unknown parameters @xmath32 and @xmath27 .",
    "let us see then all information we have on the ff s .",
    "the first equations that one must consider are the _ dynamical residue equations _ resulting from the detailed analysis of the poles they are endowed with .",
    "these equations relate ff s with different external particles and may have a different origin .",
    "in particular , for every simple bound state pole of the amplitude @xmath33 at angle @xmath34 relative to the particle @xmath35 ( see figure 1 ) , we have [ boundfpole ] _",

    "both of them are related to diagrams of the kind shown in figure 2 . for each such diagram , one can write the following equation [ doubfpole ] _ _ abi(_ab - i ) f_ab^(_ab ) = i _ ad^c _ db^e f^_ce(i ) , where @xmath38 . in the case of @xmath24 poles",
    "one can always verify that the amplitude @xmath39 has a simple zero at @xmath40 .",
    "more complicated residue equations can be in general obtained with reference to @xmath25 poles and higher order ones whose explicit expressions  not reported here  can be however easily written , once the corresponding multi ",
    "scattering diagrams have been identified .",
    "it must be stressed that the above set of equations just depend on the dynamics of the model through its @xmath14matrix and hold identical for every operator @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , in general , some residual freedom on the parameters is still expected after imposing these equations , because they must be satisfied by the ff s of all operators compatible with the assumed asymptotic behaviour .    adding to this system of _ linear _ equations the _ non  linear _ cluster equations ( [ cluster2 ] ) of the two  particle ff s , one obtains in general a redundant set of compatible equations in all the unknown parameters of the one and two  particle ff s .",

    "the truncated sums obtained by including just very few contributions have proved sufficient to attain a good approximation of all the values expected by the kac table of conformal dimensions . in this way , the one  to  one correspondence between cluster solutions and primary relevant operators can been easily set .",
    "finally , having obtained the ff s of all the relevant fields in each integrable deformation , as a further check of their correct identification , one may employ the formulas ( [ nif ] ) relative to the universal ratios of the nearby non  integrable quantum field theories .",
    "these predictions can then be compared against their numerical estimates obtained from truncated conformal space ( tcs ) approach developed in @xcite .",
    "the agreement between numerical estimates and theoretical predictions of the non  integrable effects may provide additional confirmation and may remove all possible remaining doubts about the validity of the cluster hypothesis for these models .",

    "both perturbations have two stable massive particles denoted by @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with a mass ratio and a scattering matrix which depend on the integrable direction considered . in each case",
    ", we expect to find two non  trivial independent families of form factors solutions to the cluster equations ( [ cluster ] ) ( in addition to the family of the null form factors relative to the identity operator ) .",
    "the form factors of the primary operators of the model relative to the thermal deformation have already been considered in @xcite . here , we have performed an _ ab ",
    "calculation by imposing the cluster equations : our result has been in perfect agreement with the ff s of ref.@xcite , proving in this way that these cluster solutions are also unique .",
    "the result of the computation of form factors in the two integrable deformations @xmath54_{(1,2)}$ ] and @xmath54_{(1,3)}$ ] are summarised in tables 12 and 34 respectively where we list the values of the one  particle ff s and the coefficients @xmath55 of the two  particle ff s relative to some of the lightest two  particle states .",
    "as expected , we find two non  trivial solutions of form factors families . in each deformation ,",
    "the ff s of the deforming operator suitably rescaled by ( [ th ] ) , can be immediately identified because they satisfy the peculiar equations characterizing the trace of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor ( [ fthetadiag ] ) and ( [ fthetanondiag ] ) .",
    "this is further confirmed by employing the spectral representation of the correlator @xmath56 in the sum",
    " rule ( [ sumrule2 ] ) , which provides in both deformations the value of the central charge with a very high precision ( the relative error being of order @xmath57@xmath58 ) . the identification of both the solutions with the primaries @xmath22 and @xmath23 is easily established after computing for each solution its uv anomalous dimension by means of the sum rule ( [ sumrule1 ] ) .",
    "the contributions to this sum rule coming from the dominant lightest multiparticle states are given in tables 5 and 6 for the two deformations ( the contributions are ordered according to increasing values of the mandelstam variable @xmath59 of the multi  particle state ) .",
    "the agreement of the truncated sums with the known values of the anomalous dimensions is very satisfactory given the fast convergency behaviour of the spectral series . in the computation of these sum rules , some three  particle ff contributions have been inserted as well , although we do give here their exact expression for sake of simplicity ( their general parameterization follows the one adopted for instance , in @xcite ) .",
    "it should be noticed that the oscillating behaviour of these sums is typical of non  unitary theories where one expects , in general , both positive and negative terms .      for each possible integrable deformation of the model ,",
    "the addition of a further orthogonal deformation breaks its integrability leading , among other things , to corrections of the mass spectrum and of the vacuum energy .",
    "both corrections can be independently computed by performing a numerical diagonalization of the off ",
    "critical hamiltonian by means of the so  called truncation method @xcite .",
    "we have carried out this analysis comparing these non  integrable data with the theoretical predictions by eqs.([nif ] ) .",
    "let us briefly describe the output of these studies .",

    "having obtained the ff s for the @xmath22 deformation , we are now able to complete the analysis by testing the opposite deformation @xmath60_{(1,2 ) } + \\varepsilon   \\phi_{1,3}\\,\\,\\,.\\ ] ] the numerical determination of the two universal ratios of eq.([nif ] ) ( for small values of @xmath62 ) gives @xmath63 and @xmath64 with a precision estimated to be up to a few percents .",
    "this values fully agree with the computed theoretical values @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( see , for instance figure 4 and 5 where the data relative to the ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively are reported for different values of @xmath69 ) .",
    "in this section , we turn our attention to the @xmath70 minimal model which displays a richer structure in the rg space of relevant couplings . this model has in fact , besides the identity , three primary operators @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath71 which are all relevant with conformal dimensions @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively",
    ". these fields taken separately give rise to different integrable deformations of the conformal model , each of them characterized by a different mass spectrum and @xmath14matrix ( see tables b3 , b4 and b5 in appendix b ) .",
    "in particular , the first two deformations produce three  particle mass spectra ( with different mass ratios ) while the last one gives a four  particle spectrum .",
    "the ff s of the primary operators in the @xmath23deformation had already been obtained in ref.@xcite and were known to satisfy the cluster property .",
    "again , our derivation of these ff s as solutions of the cluster equations proves that the ff s found in @xcite are the only possible cluster solutions .",
    "the form factors of the cluster solutions for each of the three above mentioned deformations have been computed according to the strategy explained in section 2 .",
    "the resulting one  particle ff s and two  particle ff s coefficients are given in tables 78 , 910 and 1112 respectively .",
    "the important result is that in each integrable deformation of this model , three families of non  trivial solutions have been found . among the solutions , we have firstly identified the ff s of the deforming field by checking the exact fulfillment of eqs.([fthetadiag ] ) and ( [ fthetanondiag ] ) , after the appropriate rescaling ( [ th ] ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath9sum  rule ( [ sumrule2 ] ) can be easily shown to give very precise approximations of the central charge in each of the three separate deformations .",
    "as for the other solutions , they have been successfully identified with the ff s of the primary operators by computing their anomalous dimension by means of eq .",
    "( [ sumrule1 ] ) .",
    "the first contributions to these sums are given in tables 13 , 14 and 15 .",
    "in all cases the agreement with the expected anomalous dimensions of the primaries is established , even though the convergence of the series is observed to be noticeably faster for lower absolute values of the anomalous dimension of the deforming field .",
    "this observed trend is indeed expected from the short  distance behavior of the correlator ( [ formexp ] ) , as predicted by the operator product expansion of the fields .",
    "in fact , in the models @xmath75 where the fields have negative anomalous dimensions , this correlator displays a zero at the origin whose power law exponent is larger for lower absolute values of the anomalous dimension of @xmath8 ; correspondingly , the small @xmath76 region of integration in ( [ sumrule1 ] ) is less relevant making the lightest multiparticle states more dominant in the series .",
    "the availability of the ff s of all the primary fields of the model has allowed us , in each of the three separate integrable deformations , to consider two different orthogonal non  integrable deformations .",
    "we have had then the possibility of testing the theoretical values obtained for the universal quantities ( [ nif ] ) versus their numerical tcs estimates in six different multiple deformations , exploring in this way the non  integrable region around the conformal point of the model .",
    "the outcome of the analysis in all the deformations is summarized in table 16 . since the precision of tcs data is expected to be of approximately a few percents ,",
    "the comparison with the computed theoretical values is in all cases quite satisfactory .",
    "the main purpose of this work has been to substantiate by means of concrete _ ab  initio _ calculations the cluster hypothesis for the form factors of the relevant operators in integrable quantum field theories obtained as deformation of a conformal action .",
    "we have studied , in particular , the matrix elements of the primary operators in the integrable deformations of the first models of the non  unitary series @xmath20 . in all cases",
    "analysed , we have confirmed the cluster hypothesis since we have found a one  to  one correspondence between the independent solutions of the cluster equations and the relevant fields .",
    "it should be said that the absence of internal symmetries of the above models has played an important role in carrying out our computations .",
    "in fact , in this situation one can exploit the cluster equations ( [ cluster ] ) in their full generality",
    ". it would be interesting to see how the results of ref.@xcite generalize to the case of quantum field theories with internal symmetries which induce selection rules on the matrix elements .",
    "another important open problem is also to understand the meaning of the cluster properties in quantum field theories which can not be regarded as deformation of conformal models .",
    "a complete understanding of all these aspects of the form factors would allow us to better understand the asymptotic high  energy regime of quantum theories and their operator content .",
