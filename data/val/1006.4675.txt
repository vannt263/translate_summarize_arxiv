    "r0.18     the term ` charcive ' was coined as a succinct description of the concepts and process of sequestering atmospheric carbon in the global black carbon reservoir @xcite .",
    "it is pronounced ` tcharckive'c is the greek letter ` chi ' . in web and print graphics",
    "the visual effect has potentially strong appeal and impact , and as a mnemonic term charcive expresses the long timescales involved : the aim is to ar**chi**ve carbon , i.e. , store a valuable substance safely for the long term @xcite",
    ". a somewhat whimsical word - play ( cha cha , jive ) also suggests the importance of periodic action on short timescales . indeed charciving is a pretty lively process , as we shall see .",
    "charciving as a physically meaningful term applies specifically to biochar creation rather than black carbon in general .",
    "biochar , defined as charcoal ( syn .",
    "char , black carbon or bc ) produced by thermal decomposition of biomass , is one of nature s long - term carbon warehouses .",
    "it has been made by nature for some 400 million years , for as long as significant terrestrial vegetation has existed  @xcite .",
    "the outcome of a charciving process is net removal of carbon from the atmospheric pool and storage in the biochar warehouse .",
    "thus , on timescales compatible with human responses to climate change , biomass may be charcived but plastics made from petroleum may not , and used tyres are partially charcive - able .",
    "more importantly in the context of the effects of open vegetation fires on global carbon pools , charciving processes include prescribed and traditional burning of forests , grasslands , savannas , and in situ crop residues if managed to enhance charring .",
    "approximate residence times of carbon in burning cycle carbon reservoirs are given in the following table : +    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]      + crucial to fire ecology , and to the global carbon cycle as a whole , is the competitive nature of these two processes : as figure [ figure1 ] indicates , volatiles are produced at the expense of char and vice versa .",
    "this reciprocal linkage was originally suggested in @xcite and has been verified by numerous experiments since .",
    "chemical feedback autocatalyses the charring path , but the heat produced promotes the competing volatilization process . ]    during thermoconversion the instantaneous balance between charring and volatilization is governed by the temperature in the reacting zone .",
    "the chemical dehydrations that produce desaturated , highly conjugated precursors to char are low activation energy reactions and therefore set in at relatively low temperatures .",
    "the water vapor produced biases the competition towards , or autocatalyses , the charring path .",
    "but charring is highly exothermic overall ( @xmath1 = -2000 j / g char ) , because desaturation and crosslinking ensure that more chemical bonds are formed than broken and significant aromatization occurs .",
    "the consequently hotter reaction zone allows the high activation energy volatilization reactions to kick in and take over  for a short time .",
    "volatilization is endothermic , with @xmath1 = 540j / g volatiles , and it locally self - damps , thus switching the reaction field again to the charring path .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that this competitive process may provide the mechanism for a thermal oscillator , and in @xcite it was shown that the solutions of a physicochemical dynamical model for cellulose thermal decomposition obtained using known rate and thermochemical data have the properties of a relaxation oscillator .",
    "the model is described in appendix i and an example time series is given in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "the temperature ( a ) rises slowly as the charring reactions proceed , as measured by production of water vapor from chemical dehydration of cellulose fragments ( b ) .",
    "heat accumulates in the reaction zone and the temperature spikes because the rate of reactive heat release exponentially overtakes the rate of linear ( conductive ) heat removal . just before the temperature jump",
    ", the water concentration is at a maximum and volatiles concentration is at a minimum ( c ) .",
    "after the jump volatilization begins to cool the system down , the volatiles concentration rises to a maximum causing a temperature collapse , then falls off and the lower temperature charring path takes over again .",
    "a time series from the dynamical model for cellulose thermal decomposition in @xcite shows classic relaxation oscillations .",
    "( a ) temperature t in k ; ( b ) w is the water vapour concentration in the reaction zone , a measure of the extent of charring ; ( c ) v is the concentration of volatiles in the reaction zone .",
    "w and v are scaled in arbitrary units . ]",
    "this is the biopy thermokinetic oscillator .",
    "understanding its properties and mechanism are crucial to understanding bushfires @xcite and to engineering biomass pyrolysis .",
    "it is related to other well - studied thermokinetic instabilities such as the salnikov and surface reaction thermal oscillators @xcite , but is distinct in that it features reciprocally coupled endothermic and exothermic reactions .",
    "it is a special case of an endex thermoreactive system @xcite , which is described in appendix ii .",
    "in fact it is not at all difficult to visualize the biopy oscillator in action , although few people these days have the apparatus for doing so  a domestic slow combustion stove .",
    "the flames of a wood fire under air control typically flicker , falter , and fluctuate as the charring and volatilization pathways alternately dominate , effectively visualizing the pulses of volatiles released by the spikes in temperature .",
    "( if you do not have your own wood stove and spare long winter s evening , try watching in slow motion some of the videos found on youtube by a search such as ` wood fired stove ' . ) in an open fire the biopy oscillator tends to be masked by turbulence , and possibly by local fluctuations in oxygen concentration .",
    "the flaming combustion path is cartooned in figure [ figure3 ] , where it is indicated that the heat of charring primarily maintains the supply of volatiles from the solid phase substrate and the heat of flaming combustion primarily activates the gas phase combustion of the volatiles . a small fraction of the char is also oxidised during a vegetation fire , as indicated by the dotted arrow .",
    "this glowing combustion of the char is a surface reaction that usually extinguishes because of surface diffusion limitations and a high activation energy barrier .",
    "the heat of charring primarily maintains volatilization of the solid phase and the heat of flaming combustion primarily maintains the gas phase combustion of the volatiles . ]    to appreciate the importance of the biopy oscillator mechanism in maintaining biomass combustion , consider a ( not uncommon ) situation where lighting ignites a mass of very damp biomass , cartooned in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "the heat of charring and heat of combustion preferentially drive the evaporation of water , an endothermic process requiring 41 kj / mol , because with an activation energy of zero it is kinetically favoured over the high activation energy volatilization and the lower activation energy charring .",
    "flaming combustion is extinguished for lack of volatile fuel to sustain it , the biopy oscillator ceases to function , and the entire thermoconversion rapidly fizzles out . viewed in this light , extinction of a vegetation fire by pouring water on it is achieved by short - circuiting the biopy oscillator .",
    "combustion of wet vegetation quickly fizzles out because the enthalpy of vaporization of water short - circuits the biopy oscillator . ]",
    "thus the biopy oscillator mechanism as illustrated in figure [ figure1 ] acts to maintain vegetation combustion while fuel is available and the effect is to distribute biomass carbon between the black carbon and atmospheric reservoirs . in a chronically wet biomass scenario , where combustion can not be sustained or propagate , refractive char is not formed and nearly 100% of biomass carbon is returned to the atmosphere as co@xmath0 or methane via the short - term decay path , which uses enzyme - catalysed oxidation reactions of low or zero activation energy .",
    "char accumulates in soils and sediments if its rate of formation exceeds its rate of oxidation .",
    "how much char is produced globally from wildfire activity per year ?",
    "what is the rate of char oxidation ?",
    "it is easy to give a rough estimate for the second question : a typical c@xmath2 activity of charcoal in sediments is around 0.6 that of new wood .",
    "the half life of c@xmath2 is 5730 years , giving the decay time constant as 0.000245/year . for such sedimentary charcoal , @xmath3 , thus @xmath4 years , and literature estimates",
    "are of order 1,3004000 years @xcite .",
    "for the first question , an estimate from a recent analytical review study @xcite for the average annual production of black carbon from wildfires during the 1990s is 2.72 tg per year .",
    "the carbon content of a typical charcoal is 85% by mass , giving the mass of carbon sequestered in the black carbon reservoir as 2.31 tg / year during the 1990s .",
    "these rates of bc formation and bc oxidation are plotted in figure [ figure5](a ) .",
    "when the mass of carbon in the global bc reservoir exceeds @xmath50.95e04gt the rate of bc oxidation exceeds the rate of formation and total bc reserves must decrease . in this case",
    "bc becomes a source of atmospheric co@xmath0 rather than a sink .",
    "the rate of bc formation , in tg c atoms / year , determines the critical global mass of c in the black carbon reservoir , c@xmath6 , above which bc becomes a source of atmospheric co@xmath0 . ]    in figure [ figure5](b ) the rate of bc formation is decreased by 20% from ( a ) . in reality",
    "this could be achieved by suppressing open biomass fires , and/or promoting drier hotter fires , and/or by combustion of the char .",
    "we see that the critical mass of carbon in the global bc reservoir is significantly lower , @xmath50.75e04gt .    in figure [ figure5](c ) the rate of bc formation",
    "is increased by 20% from ( a ) .",
    "this could be achieved by cooler more frequent open vegetation fire regimes and/or industrial biochar production in globally significant quantities .",
    "the critical mass of carbon in the global bc reservoir above which total bc reserves must decrease is considerably greater , @xmath51.15e04gt .",
    "this brings us to a third charcive challenge : how much carbon is currently stored in the global black carbon reservoir ?",
    "the answer to this crucial question will determine whether human intervention to dramatically escalate biochar production is of any use at all as a co@xmath0 sequestration strategy .",
    "human activity has promoted fire over recent decades , but suppresses fire in the long term .",
    "there are still large gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge of wildland fire emissions , such as yearly mass fluxes , spatiotemporal variability , and longer - term trends .",
    "even the open burning of agricultural residues is poorly quantified .",
    "results of the analytical review study in @xcite suggest a significant increase in emissions from wildfires during the period 19602000 due to forest and peat soil burning . in the amazon basin human activity",
    "has promoted fire since 1970s @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of forest fires in southeast asia is believed to have increased greatly since the 1960s and currently prevailing socioeconomic and natural conditions are likely to continue to favour tropical biomass burning in the short term @xcite . yet",
    "charcoal records show that global biomass burning declined from 1 to @xmath51750 , and abruptly after 1870 , the latter reduction being due to agricultural and pastoral expansion and fire suppression in intensively farmed areas @xcite .",
    "human - mediated suppression of biomass burning is likely to continue globally .",
    "the widespread fires that have been used over the past few decades to clear tropical rainforests for the planting of crops and create settled communities with higher standards of living are a transient phenomenon , after which it will be in those communities interests to suppress biomass burning .",
    "in this work i have argued that wildfires , land management fires , and open burnings of crop residues open the ` hatch ' that pours carbon into the long - term global reservoir of refractory black carbon .",
    "this is a sink for atmospheric co@xmath0 if the rate of bc production ( or dimension of the hatch ) is greater than the rate of bc decay .",
    "the hatch mechanism is the biopy thermokinetic oscillator , which is effectively short - circuited when wildfires are suppressed .",
    "the first charcive challenge asks the question : can we produce and distribute enough biochar to stabilise the earth s climate in the short - term ?",
    "it is the first challenge because the question was posed first , in response to the virgin earth challenge ( www.virgin.com/subsites /virginearth ) , not because it is the most fundamental problem in the use of biochar to regulate the earth s carbon cycles .",
    "the second charcive challenge asks whether we have painted ourselves into a corner .",
    "it asks whether humans need to suppress fire is fundamentally incompatible with nature s use of fire to distribute carbon between long - term black carbon and short - term atmospheric co@xmath0 pools .",
    "the third charcive challenge is , i think , the most important .",
    "if we can quantify the amount of black carbon in soils and sediments globally we can assess whether bc is a source or sink of co@xmath0 , then begin to make progress on all the other refinements to our knowledge of carbon flux rates and carbon reservoirs that will be necessary to devise and implement scientifically sound , socioeconomically benign global carbon management .",
    "the primary thermal decomposition of a cellulose substrate @xmath7 occurs via the competing reactions @xmath8 where @xmath9 repesents the primary volatilization product , mostly levoglucosan , @xmath10 is the char , @xmath11 is the water of charring , @xmath12 is the enthalpy of volatilization , @xmath13 is the enthalpy of charring , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the arrhenius - form rate constants .",
    "this reaction scheme is incorporated in the following dynamical system : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the volume of the reaction zone , @xmath18 is the concentration of water vapor , @xmath19 is the concentation of volatiles , @xmath20 is the molar flow rate of water vapor into the reaction volume , @xmath21 is the residence time of vapor - phase species in the reaction volume , @xmath22 is the averaged volumetric specific heat of the reacting system , @xmath23 is the rate coefficient of conductive heat transfer from the reaction zone to the environment at temperature @xmath24 .",
    "it is assumed that volatilization is a ( pseudo ) zero - order process . a mass balance for @xmath7 is not included because in this model @xmath7 is drawn from an infinite pool .",
    "this is effectively a two - dimensional dynamical system because @xmath9 is determined by @xmath25 , and a linear stability analysis finds that the relaxation oscillations in figure  [ figure2 ] occur where the eigenvalues of the jacobian are a complex conjugate pair with positive real parts .",
    "an endex thermoreactive system consists of an exothermic ( heat releasing ) reaction that is directly thermally coupled and kinetically matched with an endothermic ( heat absorbing ) reaction @xcite .",
    "the endex reactor is the ` active ' equivalent of a ` passive ' heat exchanger . in other words",
    "the endothermic and exothermic reactions ` see ' and respond to each other s thermokinetics in real time . the original context for investigation of endex systems was to achieve intrinsic thermal stability , autothermal operation",
    ", full recovery of chemical energy , scaleability , and co - production of valuable products in chemical reactor systems , and an endex - configured system has recently been used in a new technology for separating carbon dioxide from flue gas streams @xcite .    however , as is often the case with good ideas , it seems that nature can claim prior art with respect to endex systems .",
    "the thermal decomposition of cellulose appears to be nature s own endex system , of a special kind in which the competing reactions are intrinsically coupled , that functions to distribute carbon between solid black carbon and atmospheric co@xmath0 reservoirs .",
