    "the main purpose of lhc experiments is to search for new elementary particles and interactions .",
    "the higgs - like particle observability papers @xcite document a fundamental achievement for this goal . another important class of the lhc measurements aims on high - precision consistency tests of the standard model . in this respect ,",
    "a precise measurement of the @xmath7 mass plays a particularly important role @xcite . to reduce systematic errors , improvements in the measurement techniques are desirable .",
    "it is generally believed that higher precision can be achieved thanks to the use , whenever possible , of leptonic degrees of freedom rather than hadronic ones . in this way the precision better by even an order of magnitude can be achieved . at present ,",
    "the best measurements of @xmath7 mass have been performed in @xmath8 collisions at tevatron  @xcite . in the cdf collaboration the precision of @xmath9mev on the @xmath7 mass",
    "was achieved .",
    "they have estimated that the largest contribution from theory to the systematic error originates from parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) and initial - state hadronic interactions in general .",
    "an approach  @xcite based on measuring the @xmath0 angle , instead of @xmath1 transverse momentum ( @xmath10 ) , may offer a significant improvement . in ref .",
    "@xcite the first results of @xmath0 measurements with atlas experiment were presented already . in that experimental publication",
    "the systematic error of @xmath2 to @xmath0 due to implementation of qed final state radiation ( fsr ) in the monte carlo generators used , was estimated in proportion of differences observed between photos @xcite and sherpa @xcite predictions .",
    "if one understands the pattern of these differences , one can hopefully reduce systematic errors further . in this sense presented here",
    "work is continuation of recent efforts in this direction documented in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one of the possible sources of the above differences may be the second - order matrix element for qed final - state radiation ( fsr ) in @xmath1 decays .",
    "such a matrix element is missing in photos and in sherpa , but its dominant contribution is taken into account thanks to iterative and/or multiphoton nature of the algorithms .",
    "multitude of tests for photos were devoted to this point over time @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown @xcite that despite the fact that photos is not using a matrix - element - based kernel , it agrees substantially better with distributions obtained from the kkmc monte carlo  @xcite if exclusive exponentiation featuring the second - order matrix element is used rather than if the matrix element is restricted to the first - order only .",
    "the kkmc program is particularly suitable as a source of precise numerical benchmarks , because its precision was studied at the lep time in a great detail , see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite , and with precision requirements surpassing the present - day requirements of the lhc experiments .",
    "it is known since more than 20 years now @xcite that second - order terms are necessary for an exponentiation - based monte carlo generator if it is expected to assure a high precision in the case of precision observables of @xmath11 colliders .",
    "that is why such terms were implemented in the @xmath12 generators koralz @xcite and in the kkmc program as well .",
    "the precision of @xmath13 was evaluated in @xcite for small - angle bhabha scattering simulated with the monte carlo generator bhlumi @xcite .",
    "for the lhc applications , the second - order qed fsr matrix element was found to be important for simulations of background for higgs - boson searches in the @xmath14 channel @xcite . with time and improving experimental precision , contribution from the second - order qed fsr matrix element",
    "may become important for more inclusive observables at the lhc as well .",
    "first attempts to implement the second - order matrix element ( me ) to the lhc monte carlo generators are on - going ; a good example is @xcite .",
    "before such projects are completed , let us provide some quantitative results using the lep - era monte carlo program kkmc .",
    "for emulation of the initial - state hadronic interactions , parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) combined with the transverse momentum smearing based on the resbos program @xcite are used only .",
    "such an approach does nt take into account the detector simulations , nonetheless it should be sufficient to quantify the size of the effect of the second - order me .",
    "our note is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we describe our monte carlo set - up .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a careful definition of the @xmath0 distribution , including selections criteria , etc . in section  4",
    "we present our numerical results .",
    "section 5 summarizes the paper with conclusions .",
    "the kkmc event generator is constructed for @xmath15 processes and for centre - of - mass system energies from the production threshold up to @xmath16gev . for our purposes",
    "it was adapted to work for quark - anti - quark annihilation process @xmath17 . however , in this case , only qed fsr can be generated . by default , the second - order matrix element is active , but the program can be downgraded to the first - order fsr as well .",
    "we use this program as a building block in our simulation chain . with the help of winhac , the mc event generator for drell  yan processes @xcite , using the mstw2008nlo @xcite parametrisation of pdf s",
    "we generate a series of the bjorken variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 for @xmath20 collisions at @xmath21tev corresponding to production of @xmath1-bosons in a very narrow invariant mass range : @xmath22mev .",
    "then we generate monochromatic @xmath1 decays including qed fsr bremsstrahlung .",
    "let us stress that we aim at the estimation of a small second - order qed fsr effect and not at the complete predictions .",
    "that is why we can limit ourselves to the dominant qcd initial - state effects only .",
    "the generated sample has to be convoluted with the initial - state qcd effects . for the sake of convolution ,",
    "each generated @xmath23 event is boosted to the laboratory frame using @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the incoming quarks generated by winhac monte carlo @xcite . to emulate transverse momentum of @xmath1 we use smearing on the basis of a @xmath24 distribution ( histogram ) obtained from the resbos program @xcite , which was found to model data within the @xmath25 accuracy , as concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite . from this distribution",
    "we randomly generate @xmath24 of the @xmath1 boson , to be used in the boost to the laboratory frame .",
    "this is a crude approximation which , again , is acceptable in evaluation of the considered effect , only because it is expected to be small . in fig .",
    "[ figtest4 ] , distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath26 ( for @xmath27 annihilation ) are reproduced for the reference .",
    "two versions of the results will be compared : the one when the exclusive exponentiation , as embedded in kkmc , is featuring the second - order matrix element ( option ceex2 ) and the another one when it is limited to the first - order only ( option ceex1 ) , as defined in ref .",
    "the technical advantage of correlated samples will help to control differences for the two options in less populated regions of the phase space .",
    "the ceex1 variant will be implemented with an appropriate weight .",
    "this is advantageous , as we expect the difference of ceex2 and ceex1 to be rather small , but at the same time limitations due to restricted treatment of the initial - state hadronic interactions are present .",
    "we have to limit ourselves ( for the particular run ) to a fixed flavour of quarks entering the hard process , moreover the virtuality of the intermediate state has to be fixed as well .",
    "for the presented plots the incoming @xmath28-quarks were chosen and the intermediate - state virtuality was fixed in kkmc generation to @xmath1 boson mass .",
    "the results for the incoming @xmath29-quarks essentially coincide with the presented ones .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     let us now comment on the reliability of presented results . in left hand - side plot of fig .",
    "6.5 from ref .",
    "@xcite , the corrections for the @xmath0 calculated with dressed electrons , are compared for the sherpa and photos cases ; they coincide down to about @xmath30 .",
    "the distinct treatment of hadronic initial - state interactions in pythia and sherpa can not therefore be the prime source of the wavy structure in @xmath0 corrections calculated for the similar plot but with bare electrons , see right - hand side of fig . 6.5 .",
    "note that the two plots of fig .",
    "6.5 are in part statistically correlated as they are constructed from the same sample of events .",
    "the difference between dressed and bare cases likely originates from the different treatment of collinear photons .",
    "we may deduce from fig .",
    "6.5 and our fig .",
    "[ figtest3 ] that absent in sherpa second - order qed fsr matrix element can in part be responsible for the observed hint of the difference in corrections calculated for bare electrons with the two programs . in photos",
    "second- , and higher - order qed fsr terms , important in collinear limits , are taken into account thanks to iterative algorithm .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effect of the second - order matrix element with respect to the first - order one .",
    "we have concentrated mainly on the case when bare electrons were used , because it was contributing to the discussion of the sytematic error in measurement of ref .",
    "the monte carlo simulation based on the exponentiation was used for the qed final - state radiation . the @xmath0 distribution in @xmath31 production and decay at lhc was studied .",
    "we have started with the case when @xmath32 of the decaying @xmath1 was set to zero , see fig .",
    "[ figtest1 ] , the effect of the introduction of the second - order matrix element was large , at the level of @xmath33@xmath34 . however , the bulk of the distribution resided in the first bin of the histogram of @xmath35",
    ".    when the initial - state @xmath1-boson @xmath24 is taken into account , then the @xmath0 distribution is representing convolution of the dominant effect of initial - state quark transverse momenta and the qed fsr correction .",
    "the effect of @xmath24 of the incoming @xmath1 dominates .",
    "the corrections due to the second order matrix element are smaller in the case of dressed leptons .",
    "this is consistent if the effect is due to consecutive collinear photons .",
    "already the second - hardest photon requires the ceex2 matrix element to be present in the exponentiation - based mc simulations .",
    "the ratio of the parameters defining the range of the lepton - pair invariant mass @xmath36 to the virtuality of the intermediate @xmath37 used in our generation seems to be decisive for the details of the shape of the ceex2-ceex1 differences .",
    "we can conclude that starting from the precision better than @xmath2 for the @xmath0 distribution , the dominant contribution of the second - order qed fsr matrix element has to be included in discussion of systematic errors for monte carlo simulations used for the lhc experiments .",
    "the above effects are slightly larger than presently aimed precision for the fermion - pair emission or interference , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for example .",
    "the @xmath0 is an example of relatively inclusive observable , where at the least , dominant parts of the second - order qed fsr effects have to be taken into account , even if the exclusive exponentiation is in use .",
    "we could observe that the effect of the second - order matrix element was more significant in the case of the @xmath0 observable defined with the bare leptons than with the dressed ones , again confirming that the dominant effect is of the leading - logarithmic nature .",
    "that is why , one may expect that for many applications , the systematic error concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite is an overestimation .",
    "to understand when it is actually the case , more detailed studies of cut - off dependence than presented in this paper are necessary .",
    "part of this work has been inspired by the discussion with lucia di ciaccio , elzbieta richter - was , stanislaw jadach and members of the atlas lapp - annecy group ; continuous encouragement and comments on intermediate steps of the work are acknowledged .",
