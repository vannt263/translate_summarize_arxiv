    "films of @xmath0he adsorbed on strongly attractive substrates such as graphite , have been the subject of intense experimental and theoretical investigation , motivated by the remarkable variety of phases that such films display.@xcite although this research subject is relatively old , it has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the context of a search for a _ supersolid _ phase of helium , namely one displaying simultaneously crystalline order and frictionless flow . that such a phase might exist in the second layer of an adsorbed @xmath0he film on graphite ,",
    "was first suggested by crowell and reppy over a decade ago,@xcite but this contention has been recently brought back to fore.@xcite in particular , it is suggested that a supersolid phase may occur in the vicinity ( or in correspondence ) of a crystalline phase of the second adsorbed helium layer , _ registered _ with the underlying substrate .",
    "the most recent , first principles numerical studies of helium films on graphite , have yielded no evidence of such a supersolid phase , as no such registered crystal is observed.@xcite nonetheless , the general issue of interplay between boson localization , possibly induced by an external pinning potential , and superfluidity , remains one of general interest in condensed matter and quantum many - body physics .",
    "moreover , theoretical predictions may also soon be tested experimentally , possibly in a more controlled fashion , with ultracold atoms in optical lattices.@xcite    . ]    that an external potential can significantly alter the phase diagram of a system of interacting bosons , giving rise to additional phases , is well known .",
    "for example , we have recently shown how a disordering potential can give rise to a glassy phase , as well as induce superfluidity in systems that do not display it , in the absence of disorder.@xcite    in this work , we investigate theoretically , by means of monte carlo simulations , the possible existence of supersolid phases of many - boson systems in the vicinity of crystalline phases stabilized by external periodic potentials ( such as that due to the adsorption sites of a corrugated substrate ) , i.e. , _ not _ present in the phase diagram of the system in the absence of an external potential .",
    "our study is based on a lattice model of interacting bosons , similar to that which has been utilized in previous theoretical works,@xcite as a minimal model of the very nearly two - dimensional ( 2d ) first few @xmath0he adlayers on graphite.@xcite    specifically , we consider here the ( hard core ) limit of infinite on - site repulsion , i.e. , no more than one boson per site , and include a repulsive interaction ( of strength @xmath1 ) between particles occupying nearest - neighbouring lattice sites . for sufficiently strong nearest - neighbour repulsion , the ground state of the system is known to be a crystal , at particle density @xmath2=1/2 (  checkerboard \" solid ) on a square lattice,@xcite and @xmath2=1/3 ( 2/3 ) on a triangular lattice.@xcite we include here a sublattice of _ attractive _ sites as well , acting as a strong pinning potential ( see fig .",
    "[ epot ] ) .",
    "the sublattice is purposefully chosen _ not _ to correspond to any crystal structure which the system forms in the absence of an external potential . for sufficiently strong adsorption , additional crystalline phases can be expected to appear , registered with the adsorption sublattice ; henceforth , we shall refer to these crystalline phases as _ commensurate _ , the term _ incommensurate _ being used instead to refer to the solid phases that the system forms in the absence of any external potential .",
    "for example , our choice of pinning potential on the triangular lattice is such that particle density @xmath2=@xmath3=1/4 corresponds to a commensurate crystal , while @xmath2=@xmath4=1/3 to an incommensurate one . in other words , here the terms ",
    "commensurate \" and  incommensurate \" are with respect to the pinning potential .",
    "the purpose of this study is to provide a simple theoretical framework to interpret experimental studies probing for possible ( commensurate ) supersolid phases of helium films on graphite .",
    "although we mostly discuss here numerical results obtained on a triangular lattice geometry , we have observed the same general physical behaviour on the square lattice as well .",
    "our main findings is that supersolid phases exist on both the interstitial and on the vacancy side of a commensurate ( registered ) crystal .",
    "however , the superfluid density _ always vanishes _ as the density hits a value corresponding to either a commensurate or incommensurate crystal . in this sense",
    ", the pinning potential does not give rise to fundamentally new behaviour , with respect to what is observed in this model near and/or at incommensurate crystal phases , in the absence of any external potential.@xcite the vanishing of the superfluid response at crystal density , appears therefore to be a general hallmark of any phase labelled as  supersolid \" , occurring in a system of this type , i.e. , in the presence of an external pinning potential .",

    "a discontinuity of the curve signals a first - order phase transition between a superfluid and the incommensurate crystal .",
    "analogously to what observed in the model without pinning potential,@xcite for sufficiently large @xmath1 the @xmath33 curve is continuous on the interstitial side ( @xmath34 ) , as a supersolid phase exists .    as the strength of the pinning potential",
    "is increased , two additional crystalline phases appear , one at @xmath35 , the other at @xmath2=5/8 . henceforth , we shall focus our attention on the phase of density @xmath3 , which is registered with the pinning potential .",

    "the commensurate phase @xmath38 is monotonically decreasing with @xmath1 , as the presence of a strong nearest - neighbour repulsion , which causes the appearance of the incommensurate crystalline phase at @xmath39 also favours the formation of a commensurate crystal at @xmath3 ( in fact , @xmath38 approaches zero as @xmath40 ) . on the other hand , the right part of fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] shows that the pinning potential _ suppresses _ crystallization at density @xmath4 , i.e.",
    ", a _ greater value _ of @xmath1 is needed to stabilize the incommensurate crystal at @xmath39 if the external pinning potential is present .",
    "this is due to the lattice mismatch of two competing crystalline phases .",
    "a sufficiently large value of @xmath29 causes the incommensurate phase to disappear altogether .",
    "we now discuss the superfluid properties of the system near crystallization .",

    "the choice of parameters , namely @xmath1=4 and @xmath29=5 , corresponds to a situation in which the only crystalline phase that the system forms is the commensurate one , at a density @xmath3 . both @xmath41 and @xmath22 are everywhere _ finite _ , except at exactly @xmath3 where the superfluid response vanishes .",
    "the fact that @xmath33 is continuous everywhere , allows one to rule out coexistence of two phases ( superfluid and crystal ) possessing only one of the two types of order .",
    "thus , based on its strict definition , one would have to conclude that this system is everywhere  supersolid \" , except at commensurate density .",
    "however , such a denomination appears to be meaningful ( if at all ) only in the vicinity of @xmath3 , where the physical character of the phase can be surmised to be that of a commensurate crystal doped with either vacancies or interstitials .",

    "that at _ exactly _ @xmath48 the superfluid fraction vanishes , is a significant result that warrants a few comments .",
    "supersolidity in model ( [ ham ] ) on the triangular lattice ( it is not present on the square lattice ) , requires that a crystal be doped with interstitial particles , i.e. , the superfluid density of an undoped crystal is always zero.@xcite however , one might speculate that the lower density commensurate phase stabilized by the external potential might enjoy different properties than the incommensurate one , which is the only one observed in the absence of a pinning potential .",
    "we find , however , that the superfluid density always vanishes at @xmath3 , on both lattice geometries considered here .",
    "we have also repeated the same analysis for different choices of the parameters , including those for which both commensurate and incommensurate phases exists , but the presence of an incommensurate phase at higher density does not alter the physics of the system in the vicinity of @xmath3 , i.e. , a  supersolid \" phase exists on both the interstitial and vacancy sides , but not at commensuration .    this is a result of potential experimental relevance , as studies of adsorbed @xmath0he films on corrugated substrate on graphite , for which claims of possible supersolid behaviour near commensurate density are made , can determine the superfluid response as a function of coverage .",
    "it appears from our results that , to the extent that ( [ ham ] ) can be regarded as a reasonable qualitative model of a thin helium film on a corrugated substrate , the superfluid signal must vanish at the coverage corresponding the occurrence of a commensurate crystal , if one is to make a claim of a  supersolid \" phase near or at commensuration .",
    "the physics of the system near the incommensurate crystal phase is the same as in the absence of an external potential.@xcite in particular , the superfluid density again always vanishes at @xmath4 . here too , one might have expected that the weakening of the incommensurate crystal caused by the pinning potential could give rise to a ",
    "softer \" crystalline phase , capable of superflow .",
    "what is observed , however , is that as long as the incommensurate crystal exists , the superfluid density at @xmath4 vanishes .",
    "there is always a first - order phase transition on the vacancy side ; on the other hand , on the interstitial side , depending on the value of @xmath1 one may have a first - order phase transition to a superfluid or a second - order phase transition to a supersolid .",
    "versus chemical potential @xmath28 for the ground state of ( [ ham ] ) , with v = 8 , @xmath49 .",
    "the density jump signals a first - order phase transition between a commensurate and an incommensurate crystal . ]",
    "we now consider the regime in which both the commensurate and incommensurate phases exist , and explore the quantum phase transitions between the two , with the possible occurrence of intervening phases .",
    "there are two possible scenarios which have been observed : one is a direct transition from the commensurate to the incommensurate crystal , through a first order transition . in other words , there is only a jump in the curve @xmath33 from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ crycry ] .",
    "this occurs roughly in a regime where @xmath50 , and is a scenario that appears to apply to the first layer of helium on graphite,@xcite or to films of molecular hydrogen adsorbed on graphite , or other corrugated substrates.@xcite + the other scenario , occurring for @xmath51 , is a second - order transition from the commensurate crystal at @xmath3 to a doped supersolid phase , and then , as the density is increased , to a superfluid , followed by a first order phase transition from the superfluid to the incommensurate crystal at @xmath4 .",
    "the transition from supersolid to superfluid is indicated by the change in slope of the @xmath33 curve .",
    "again , we should note that this superfluid phase with a density modulation arising from the pinning potential .",
    "we have studied the ground state phase diagram of lattice hard core lattice bosons with a nearest - neighbour repulsion , in the presence of an external periodic potential mimicking a superlattice of adsorption sites .",
    "we have utilized an exact numerical method .",
    "our goal , in using such a simplified model , was obviously not that of achieving a realistic description of an actual adsorbed film on a given substrate , but rather to gain qualitative understanding of the different phases that one may be able to observe experimentally .",
    "we have carried out our studies on triangular and square lattice geometries , as well as different choices of external potential periodicity , always chosen to be _ not _ commensurate with the crystalline phase that the system forms in the absence of a potential .",
    "the main findings are independent of the lattice geometry and/or potential periodicity .",
    "our results show that in specific circumstances  supersolid \" phases ( whether or not such terminology is appropriate , given the crucial role played by the external potential , is a matter of debate ) can exist in the vicinity of commensurate crystals stabilized by the adsorption potential .",
    "a distinctive signature of the occurrence of such phases is the vanishing of the superfluid density at commensuration .",
    "this seems to be a universal feature of this type of system , one that we would expect to see in any experiment claiming observation of a supersolid phase of adsorbed films ( e.g. , of @xmath0he ) on substrates such as graphite .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that these predictions may also lend themselves to possible experimental verification by means of ultracold atoms in optical lattices.@xcite",
