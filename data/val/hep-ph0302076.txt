    "the precise measurement of the z total decay width at lep and its agreement with its standard model prediction  @xcite ( with @xmath5@xmath6 ) @xmath7 are often exploited to constrain the cross section of new physics processes  @xcite .",
    "indeed , under the assumption that new physics contributions to the z width are exclusively positive ( as is the case for processes kinematically allowed at @xmath8 ) , this agreement allows a 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) limit of @xmath9 to be set on any exotic contribution to @xmath10 .",
    "however , extensions of the standard model , such as supersymmetry or technicolor , generate a whole set of new particles , which may or may not be produced in @xmath11  collisions at @xmath8 .",
    "the particles that are too heavy to be produced in z decays may still contribute to the z width through vacuum polarization diagrams with a generally undetermined sign .",
    "it may therefore well occur that negative contributions be sizeable and invalidate the widely used aforementioned limit on @xmath12 .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to derive model - independent limits on additional contributions to z decays , and to use these limits to unambiguously constrain the light gluino mass window .",
    "it is indeed controversial if a light gluino @xmath3  of mass below 5@xmath6  is phenomenologically viable  @xcite",
    ". a review of existing limits and of the related weak points can be found in ref .",
    "in particular , a study of the qcd colour factors from four - jet angular correlations and the differential two - jet rate in z decays , performed by aleph , allowed a 95%c.l .",
    "lower limit of 6.3@xmath6  to be set on @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "however , it was argued by the light gluino defenders  @xcite that this limit was to be weakened because _ ( i ) _ the theory uncertainties were too aggressive ; and _ ( ii ) _ no next - to - leading - order mass corrections were available for the four - jet angular correlations .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "vacuum ] , the reader is reminded of the model - independent parametrization of the weak loop corrections to the electroweak observables according to the @xmath0 formalism  @xcite .",
    "this formalism is extended in section  [ sec : hadronic ] to the corrections caused by any new physics production process , in either the hadronic , the leptonic or the invisible final state .",
    "the result is applied to the @xmath14 process in section  [ sec : gluino ] and a model - independent lower limit on the gluino mass is obtained .",
    "virtual contributions to the `` electroweak observables '' have been parametrized in a model - independent way by several authors . here , the choice was made to parametrize the basic electroweak observables , _",
    "i.e. _ , those sensitive to the weak loop corrections , with the ( linearized ) @xmath0 formalism , according to  @xcite    @xmath15    where @xmath16 are the born approximations of the corresponding observables , _",
    "i.e. , _ without any weak loop corrections , and where the pure qcd- and qed - corrections were parametrized as @xmath17    in the standard model , or in any theory that does not predict new open processes in @xmath11  collisions at @xmath8 , the three @xmath0 s can then be fit to the precise measurements of lep and slc  @xcite , summarized in table  [ tab : data ] .",
    ".precise lep and slc measurements of the z lineshape parameters ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) , of @xmath21 and of @xmath22 , together with their correlation matrix .",
    "the last two measurements have been taken here as uncorrelated with the first three  @xcite .",
    "[ tab : data ] [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     because the existence of new particles could also modify the evolution of the electromagnetic coupling constant from 0 to @xmath23 , it was checked whether these limits could be affected by a variation of @xmath24 . this check is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha]a , where it appears that the standard model value of @xmath25 yields the largest upper limits on the three partial widths . the limits of table  [ tab :",
    "limit ] are therefore conservative in this respect .",
    "new light hadronic flavours would also modify the evolution of the strong coupling constant .",
    "although , as already mentioned , @xmath26 is constrained by measurements performed directly at the z mass scale , it is also determined with at least as accurate low energy measurements extrapolated at @xmath23 . a different scaling law for the latter would modify the world average of @xmath26 . however , a contribution from new coloured scalars or fermions would always slow down the running from low energy to @xmath23  so as to increase the value of @xmath27  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha]b , such an increase of @xmath26 would render more constraining the limits on the hadronic and invisible partial widths . the limit on the leptonic width",
    "would be slightly weakened , but would anyway remain the strongest of the three constraints .",
    "the conservative choice of ignoring this effect was made throughout .",
    "finally , it may be argued that a new hadronic contribution to z decays would decrease the value of @xmath26 fitted from the z lineshape .",
    "however , the @xmath26 world average and its uncertainty ( saturated by common theory errors ) , and therefore the result of the present fit , do not change noticeably when the @xmath26 measurement from the z lineshape in taken out .",

    "let @xmath29 , @xmath30  and @xmath31  be the fractions of hadronic , leptonic and invisible final states produced by the new physics process under consideration . by definition , a final state which is neither hadronic nor leptonic is called invisible , therefore @xmath32 .",

    "equations  ( 4 ) to  ( 7 ) no longer yield an independent determination of @xmath37  and @xmath38  with meaningful accuracy , because they all depend on the same linear combination of the two quantities . as a result",
    ", the new particle contribution to the z width can always be cancelled by the @xmath39 virtual contribution , if a sufficient amount of fine tuning takes place .",
    "whether or not this amount of fine tuning is acceptable would need different measurements and/or more theory to decide .",
    "the results obtained in section  [ sec : hadronic ] can be applied to a variety of new processes . in this letter , they are used to constrain the cross section of the gluino production at @xmath8 in the process @xmath40 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : gunion ] as a function of the gluino mass  @xcite .",
    "because this cross section is the product of the @xmath41 cross section and a term that describes the gluon splitting into a gluino pair , the uncertainties related to the weak loop corrections to @xmath14 were alleviated by using the measured  cross section in the prediction .",
    "when the gluino is light , the final state arising from this process is purely hadronic irrespective of the gluino decay and hadronization , and therefore contributes solely to the z hadronic decay width in all quark flavours .",
    "upper limit on the production cross section at @xmath8 can then be set at 67pb ( table  [ tab : limit ] ) .",
    "the corresponding lower limit on the gluino mass can be read off from the curve in fig .",

    "a combination of these results would further consolidate the light gluino exclusion .",
    "for instance , a combination of the present limit and that of ref .",
    "@xcite yields lower limits on @xmath13  of 6.8@xmath6  and 5.7@xmath6  at 95% and 99.63%c.l .",
    ", respectively .",
    "the present limit is not affected by the criticisms put forward to invalidate the previous results .",
    "it is only if three different fine tuning processes took place , _",
    "i.e. , _    1 .",
    "if other new particles were produced in association with the gluino with a cross section of the order of or larger than that of the gluino production , but still were not directly detected at lep ; 2 .   if these processes led to final states such that the overall fractions of hadronic , invisible and leptonic new decays be similar to those of the z decays , for all lepton and quark flavours ; 3 .   and",
    "if additional new physics yielded large negative virtual contributions to the z total decay width ( from the @xmath43 combination ) to exactly compensate this multiple new particle production ;    that the limit derived with the method presented in this letter would not hold .",
    "i leave it to the champions of the light gluino scenario to find a theory in which this devilish conspiracy could take place .",
    "a method to derive model - independent limits on new physics contributions to z decays has been presented . no general upper limit on the total z decay width",
    "could be obtained , but very stringent constraints apply when the final states produced by the new physics process of interest are known . in particular , conservative upper limits have been put on @xmath18 of 0.55 , 1.3 and 3.9 mev in the case of purely leptonic ( @xmath35 or @xmath36 ) , invisible and hadronic final states .",
