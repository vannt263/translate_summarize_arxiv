    "predictions of neutrino cross - sections at high energies have sizeable uncertainties which derive largely from the measurement uncertainties on the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) of the nucleon . in the framework of the quark - parton model , high energy scattering accesses very large values of @xmath0 , the invariant mass of the exchanged vector boson , and very small values of bjorken @xmath1 , the fraction of the momentum of the incoming nucleon taken by the struck quark .",
    "thus when evaluating uncertainties on high energy neutrino cross - sections it is important to use the most up to date information from the experiments at hera , which have accessed the lowest-@xmath1 and highest @xmath0 scales to date . the present paper uses the formalism of the zeus - s global pdf fits  @xcite , updated to include _ all _ the hera - i data .",
    "conventional pdf fits use the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) formalism  @xcite of qcd to make predictions for deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross - sections of leptons on hadrons . at low-@xmath1",
    "where the gluon density is rising rapidly it is probably necessary to go beyond the dglap formalism in order to sum @xmath2 diagrams , as in the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) formalism  @xcite ( for recent work see  @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to consider non - linear terms which describe gluon recombination as in the colour glass condensate model  @xcite which has had considerable success in explaining rhic data  @xcite .",
    "a recent suggestion is to use a structure function consistent with hera data that saturates the froissart unitarity bound and thus predicts a @xmath3 dependence of the cross - section  @xcite .",
    "such approaches are beyond the scope of the present paper , which is concerned with the more modest goal of estimating the uncertainties on high energy neutrino cross - sections which are compatible with the conventional nlo dglap formalism .",
    "the motivation is to provide an update on the neutrino cross - sections in the literature @xcite which are widely used e.g. for estimating event rates in neutrino telescopes such as baikal @xcite , antares @xcite and icecube @xcite , cosmic ray observatories such as hires @xcite and auger @xcite , and radio detectors such as glue @xcite , forte @xcite , rice @xcite and anita @xcite . as a corollary ,",
    "if cross - sections much outside these limits are observed , it would be a clear signal of the need for extensions to conventional formalism . to date no unambiguous signals which require such extensions",
    "have been observed .",
    "the prospect for measuring the cross - section using very high energy cosmic neutrinos in order to distinguish between theoretical suggestions for gluon dynamics at low @xmath1 has been discussed by us elsewhere @xcite .",
    "previous work on estimating high energy neutrino cross - sections  @xcite used pdf sets which no longer fit modern data from hera  @xcite and an _ ad hoc _ procedure for estimating pdf uncertainties .",
    "the present work improves on this in several respects .",
    "firstly , we use a recent pdf analysis which includes data from all hera - i running  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we take a consistent approach to pdf uncertainties  both model uncertainties and , more importantly , the uncertainties which derive from the correlated systematic errors of the input data sets @xcite .",
    "thirdly , we use nlo rather than lo calculations throughout .",
    "fourthly , we use a general - mass variable flavour number scheme  @xcite to treat heavy quark thresholds .",
    "parton density function ( pdf ) determinations are global fits  @xcite , which use inclusive cross - section data and structure function measurements from deep inelastic lepton hadron scattering ( dis ) data .",
    "the kinematics of lepton hadron scattering is described in terms of the variables @xmath0 , bjorken @xmath1 , and @xmath4 which measures the energy transfer between the lepton and hadron systems .",
    "the double differential charged current ( cc ) cross - section for neutrino and antineutrino production on isoscalar nucleon targets are given by @xcite , @xmath5 where the reduced cross - sections @xmath6 are given by @xmath7,\\ ] ] and @xmath8,\\ ] ] where the structure functions @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are related directly to quark momentum distributions .",
    "the qcd predictions for these structure functions are obtained by solving the dglap evolution equations at nlo in the scheme with the renormalisation and factorization scales both chosen to be @xmath0 .",
    "these equations yield the pdfs at all values of @xmath0 provided these distributions have been input as functions of @xmath1 at some input scale @xmath12 .",
    "the resulting pdfs are then convoluted with coefficient functions , in order to obtain the structure functions .",
    "we use the pdf fit formalism of the published zeus - s global pdf analysis  @xcite , but this fit is updated as follows .",
    "first , the range of the calculation has been extended up to @xmath13  gev@xmath14 and down to @xmath15 .",
    "second , _ all _",
    "inclusive cross - section data for neutral and charged current reactions from zeus hera - i running ( 19942000 ) are included in the fit .",
    "third , the parametrization is extended from 11 to 13 free parameters , input at @xmath16  gev@xmath14 . in summary ,",
    "the pdfs for @xmath17 valence quarks ( @xmath18 ) , @xmath19 valence quarks ( @xmath20 ) , total sea quarks ( @xmath21 ) , and the gluon ( @xmath22 ) , are each parametrized by the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the strong coupling constant is taken to be @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "the total sea contribution is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 for each flavour , @xmath28 and @xmath29 for all other flavours .",
    "the flavour structure of the light quark sea allows for the violation of the gottfried sum rule such that @xmath30 is non - zero , but only the normalisation of this quantity is free , the shape being fixed in accordance with e866 drell - yan data  @xcite .",
    "a suppression of the strange sea with respect to the non - strange sea of a factor of 2 at @xmath12 is also imposed , consistent with neutrino induced dimuon data from ccfr  @xcite .",
    "the normalisation parameters , @xmath31 , for the @xmath19 and @xmath17 valence and for the gluon are constrained to impose the number sum - rules and momentum sum - rule .",
    "the low-@xmath1 shape parameters @xmath32 for the @xmath17 and @xmath19 valence quarks are set equal .",
    "finally there are 13 free pdf parameters .",
    "reasonable variations of these assumptions about the input parametrization are included in the model uncertainties on the output pdfs",
    ".    a more important source of uncertainties on the pdfs comes from the experimental uncertainties on the input data .",
    "the pdfs are presented with full accounting for uncertainties from correlated systematic errors ( as well as from statistical and uncorrelated sources ) using the conservative offset method .",
    "the uncertainty bands should be regarded as @xmath33 confidence limits . a full discussion of approaches to estimating pdf uncertainties is given in  @xcite .",
    "the pdf uncertainties from this updated zeus - s-13 fit are comparable to those on the published zeus - s fit @xcite , as well as the most recent fits of the cteq  @xcite and mrst  @xcite groups .",
    "previous work  @xcite treated heavy quark production by using a zero - mass variable flavour number scheme , with slow - rescaling at the @xmath34 to @xmath35 threshold . although , as explained in section  [ sec : results ] , the exact treatment of the @xmath36 threshold is not very important for the estimation of high energy neutrino cross - sections , it is important to use a correct treatment of heavy quark thresholds when determining the pdfs .",
    "we note that the central values of the sea quark distributions of the most recent cteq6.5 analysis @xcite which uses a general mass variable flavour scheme for heavy quarks , lie _ outside _ the @xmath37 cl uncertainty estimates of the previous cteq6.1 analysis @xcite , which used a zero - mass variable flavour number scheme ( as did all previous cteq analyses ) .",
    "this difference is significant for lower @xmath0 ( @xmath38  gev@xmath14 ) and middling @xmath1 ( @xmath39 ) and this is a kinematic region of relevance to the present study .",
    "the heavy quark production scheme used in the present fit is the general mass variable flavour number scheme of roberts and thorne  @xcite .",
    "the central values of both the cteq6.5 pdf analysis @xcite and the mrst2004 nlo analysis  @xcite ( which also uses a general - mass variable flavour number scheme ) lie within , or very close to , the uncertainty bands of the present analysis over the entire kinematic region of interest .",
    "at very small @xmath1 and high @xmath0 , the @xmath40 cross - section is dominated by sea quarks produced by gluon splitting @xmath41 . in this kinematic region ,",
    "the parametrisation of the gluon momentum distribution is approximately : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 .",
    "figure  [ fig : glusea ] shows the predicted sea and gluon distributions from the present pdf fit and their fractional uncertainties , at various @xmath0 values .",
    "this illustrates that the pdf uncertainties are largest at low @xmath0 and at low-@xmath1 .",
    "pdf uncertainties are also large at very high-@xmath1 but this kinematic region is not important for scattering of high energy neutrinos .    in qcd at leading order , the longitudinal structure function @xmath11 is identically zero , and the structure functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 for neutrino interactions on isoscalar targets can be identified with quark distributions as follows : @xmath44 similarly for antineutrino interactions , @xmath45 assuming , @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath47 , whereas @xmath48 . at nlo",
    "these expressions must be convoluted with appropriate coefficient functions ( such that @xmath11 is no longer zero ) but these expressions still give us a good idea of the dominant contributions .",
    "note however that the @xmath34 contribution will be very suppressed until @xmath49  gev@xmath14 , since the @xmath50 coupling is dominant .    in figure",
    "[ fig : stfns ] we show predictions for the neutrino structure functions @xmath51 ,",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 and in figure  [ fig : xf3nubar ] we show the antineutrino structure function @xmath54 . in order to illustrate the potential impact of the @xmath34 contribution ,",
    "these were calculated using the coefficient functions of the zero - mass variable flavour number scheme with ( lower panels ) and without ( upper panels ) the @xmath34 contribution .",
    "note that the input pdfs were still determined using the general mass variable flavour number scheme .    the predictions for @xmath9 and @xmath11",
    "are somewhat suppressed without the @xmath34 contribution , as is expected since the contribution of @xmath34 to @xmath9 is at most @xmath55 . however , the effect on @xmath10 is much more dramatic .",
    "this can be understood by considering the lo expressions @xmath56 and @xmath57 at low-@xmath1 the valence contributions are close to zero , while the strange and charm sea are of opposite sign and nearly equal , such that @xmath10 is nearly all @xmath34 quark and @xmath58 .",
    "even though there are dramatic differences in predictions for @xmath10 with and without the @xmath34 contribution , this does not lead to significant differences in the @xmath40 and @xmath59 cross - sections because , at low-@xmath1 , @xmath60 , and the @xmath4 dependence suppresses the contribution of @xmath10 further .",
    "the @xmath34 contribution to the reduced cross - section integrated over @xmath4 is always less than @xmath61 .",
    "however , in practice it is even more suppressed for cc processes since @xmath34 is important only at higher @xmath62 ) because of the @xmath35 threshold .",
    "furthermore , in the total cross - section , the @xmath63 propagator suppresses the contribution of the kinematic region @xmath64 , such that contributions from @xmath65 are suppressed very significantly .",
    "figure  [ fig : nuxsecns ] shows the predictions for the reduced neutrino cross - sections as a function of @xmath1 for various @xmath0 values above and below @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "these illustrations have been made in terms of the reduced cross - section in order that one can see how the structure functions ( hence the pdfs ) contribute to the total cross - section .",
    "these cross - sections have been calculated using the coefficient functions of the general - mass variable flavour scheme and are given for two representative values of the neutrino energy : @xmath68  gev@xmath14 ( @xmath69  gev ) and @xmath70  gev@xmath14 ( @xmath71  gev ) .",
    "we do not show the antineutrino cross - sections separately because these are very close to the neutrino cross - sections at high energy .",
    "this is because the dominant structure function is @xmath47 , and although , @xmath72 , the structure function @xmath10 contributes with _ opposite _ sign in the neutrino and antineutrino cross - sections such that the net contribution of @xmath10 is the same .",
    "the restriction on the lowest value of @xmath1 probed for each @xmath0 value is explained by the effect of the kinematic cut - off , @xmath73 : since , @xmath74 , we must have , @xmath75 .",
    "this kinematic cut - off ensures that higher @xmath0 values do not probe very low-@xmath1 until the neutrino energies are very high indeed .",
    "these figures illustrate which regions of @xmath1 and @xmath0 contribute most strongly to the reduced cross - section for the different neutrino energies .",
    "the dominant contributions come from @xmath76  gev@xmath14 ( where the exact region moves up gradually with @xmath77 ) ; the contribution of higher @xmath0 ( @xmath78 ) is suppressed by the @xmath63-propagator . for the lower energy @xmath79  gev ,",
    "the important range is @xmath80 , while for the higher energy @xmath81  gev , this moves down to @xmath82 .",
    "the pdf uncertainties are large at low-@xmath1 and low @xmath0 , but since the dominant contributions to the cross - section do _ not _ come from very low @xmath0 values , the pdf uncertainty on the total neutrino cross - section is quite small even at the highest energies considered here : @xmath83",
    "gev@xmath14 .",
    "the total neutrino cross - sections are now obtained by integrating the predicted double differential cross - section @xmath84 with no cuts on either kinematic variable .",
    "and we are happy to provide the differential cross - section for use in simulation programmes . ]",
    "these cross - sections are tabulated in table  [ tab : hiexsecns ] at various values of @xmath77 between @xmath85 and @xmath86  gev@xmath14 , together with their uncertainties due to the pdfs , including both model uncertainties and the experimental uncertainties of the input data sets .",
    "the trend of the pdf uncertainties can be understood by noting that as one moves to higher and higher neutrino energies one also moves to lower and lower @xmath1 where the pdf uncertainties are increasing .",
    "these energies are relevant to e.g. the auger experiment where cosmic neutrinos can be detected both as quasi - horizontal deeply penetrating air showers and ( specifically @xmath87s ) as earth - skimming tau showers @xcite .",
    "we have shown elsewhere @xcite that the ratio of these two classes of events is a diagnostic of the @xmath40 cross - section , _ independently _ of the ( rather uncertain ) cosmic neutrino flux .",
    "the latter determines the absolute rates  e.g. assuming that extragalactic sources of the observed ultrahigh energy cosmic rays generate a neutrino flux saturating the `` waxman - bahcall bound''@xcite , it would take 10 years of running with a @xmath88  km@xmath14 array to tell whether the @xmath40 cross - section is suppressed significantly below the ( unscreened ) standard model prediction .",
    "proposed satellite - borne detectors such as euso and owl would scan even larger areas and achieve the necessary acceptance within a few years of running @xcite .",
    ".neutrino - nucleon total cc cross - section , with the associated pdf uncertainty , at high energies . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have calculated the charged current neutrino cross - section at nlo in the standard model using the best available dis data along with a careful estimate of the associated uncertainties . as mentioned earlier , there are further uncertainties associated with qcd effects at very low @xmath1 which are not addressed in the dglap formalism .",
    "when @xmath1 is sufficiently small that @xmath89 , it is necessary to resum these large logarithms using the bfkl formalism . whereas such calculations at leading - log suggest an even steeper rise of the gluon structure function at low @xmath1 ( which would imply a higher @xmath90 cross - section ) , this rise is not so dramatic at next - to - leading - log ; for a recent application of nll bfkl resummation to deep inelastic scattering see  @xcite .",
    "moreover both the dglap and the bfkl formalisms neglect non - linear screening effects due to gluon recombination which may lead to saturation of the gluon structure function .",
    "this has been modelled in the colour dipole framework in which dis at low @xmath1 is viewed as the interaction of the @xmath91 dipole to which the gauge bosons fluctuate .",
    "an unified bfkl / dglap calculation @xcite supplemented by estimates of screening and nuclear shadowing effects , predicts a _ decrease _ of the @xmath90 cross - section by @xmath92 at very high energies @xmath93  gev  @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach uses the colour glass condensate formalism  @xcite and predicts a similar suppression when a dipole model  @xcite which fits data from rhic is used  @xcite .",
    "the predicted cross - section is even lower  @xcite if a different dipole model  @xcite developed to fit the hera data is used and the gluon distribution is assumed to decrease for @xmath94 .",
    "other possibilities for the behaviour of the high energy @xmath90 cross - section have also been discussed  @xcite .",
    "detectors for uhe cosmic neutrinos would be able to probe such new physics if they can establish deviations from the perturbative dglap prediction .",
    "hence we recommend our calculated values for estimation of the baseline event rates in neutrino telescopes and for use in event generators such as anis @xcite . while the expected neutrino fluxes ( e.g. from the sources of the observed high energy cosmic rays ) are rather uncertain , experiments can in principle exploit the different dependence on the cross - section of the rate of earth - skimming and quasi - horizontal events @xcite .",

    "<S> we have updated predictions for high energy neutrino and antineutrino charged current cross - sections within the conventional dglap formalism of nlo qcd using a modern pdf fit to hera data , which also accounts in a systematic way for pdf uncertainties deriving from both model uncertainties and from the experimental uncertainties of the input data sets . furthermore the pdfs are determined using an improved treatment of heavy quark thresholds . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of the neutrino cross - section much below these predictions would signal the need for extension of the conventional formalism as in bfkl resummation , or even gluon recombination effects as in the colour glass condensate model . </S>"
