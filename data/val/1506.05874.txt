    "line tension  @xcite occurs in the presence of a three phase contact line , which separates three phases such as liquid , solid , and vapor .",
    "line tension plays a fundamental role in , for example , the stability of liquid droplets adsorbed onto a solid substrate .",
    "however , it has been debated whether line tension plays a role in wetting because the magnitude of line tension is quite low  @xcite .",
    "line tension should play role in heterogeneous nucleation on a substrate as well because three - phase contact exists in such a case  @xcite .",
    "however , the problem of line tension in heterogeneous nucleation has been largely ignored , with the exception of the pioneering theoretical work by navascus and tarazona  @xcite and the recent detailed study by singha et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the heterogeneous nucleation of a lens - shaped nucleus on an ideally spherical substrate was theoretically formulated half a century ago ( in 1958 ) by fletcher  @xcite after the work by turnbull  @xcite on a flat substrate . since then",

    "further theoretical analysis has not been conducted until recently , because of the mathematical complexity of the problem  @xcite .",
    "the same problem has also been studied from the standpoint of wetting  @xcite . however , thus far , few studies have been conducted on the effect of line - tension on a spherical substrate  @xcite , while many studies have been conducted on the effect of line tension on a flat substrate  @xcite .",
    "there have also been several studies on heterogeneous nucleation in a confined volume  @xcite and within a cavity  @xcite .",
    "a similar problem of a macroscopic droplet on convex and concave spherical surfaces has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "recently , line - tension - dominated nucleation has been studied through computer simulation  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the importance of the line tension was recently pointed out by greer  @xcite .",
    "in fact , nucleation is often heterogeneous and is assisted by the presence of a substrate or wall and impurities .",
    "therefore , understanding the effect of line tension on nucleation is crucial to clarify the whole process of heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "however , since a theoretical study of line tension has been hindered by the complex mathematics and geometry , most recent studies on heterogeneous nucleation have relied on computer simulations  @xcite or ad hoc assumptions  @xcite , the predictive power of which for designing new material is limited compared to mathematically rigorous formulations .    in the present study",
    ", we extend our existing knowledge on line tension on convex and concave spherical surfaces  @xcite and consider the free energy of a lens - shaped critical nucleus nucleated on a spherical substrate and on a wall of a spherical cavity within the framework of the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) .",
    "we consider the critical nucleus as a continuum of uniform density having a sharp interface with a part of a spherical substrate .",
    "consequently , the contact line and angle can be defined without ambiguity .",
    "the nucleus - substrate interaction is represented by the appropriate surface tension ( energy ) confined to the contact area so that the classical concept of surface tension and interfacial energy can be applied .",
    "we find that a spherical nucleus of homogeneous nucleation may have a lower free energy than a lens - shaped nucleus of heterogeneous nucleation when the line tension is positive and large , which is similar to the drying transition  @xcite .",
    "we also find that the free energy of a lens - shaped nucleus becomes negative when the line tension is negative and large , which will leads to the barrier - less athermal nucleation  @xcite with no thermal activation process .",
    "in this section , we summarize the mathematical results of our previous work  @xcite and discuss the physics of line tension in detail .",
    "we consider a lens - shaped liquid nucleus nucleated on a spherical substrate from oversaturated vapor .",

    "this is similar to the limit @xmath35 of the classical young equation ( eq .  ( [ eq : ln4 ] ) ) , which does not imply that the nucleus disappears .",

    "<S> line - tension - induced scenario of heterogeneous nucleation is studied for a lens - shaped nucleus with a finite contact angle nucleated on a spherical substrate and on the bottom of the wall of a spherical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of line tension on the free energy of a critical nucleus can be separated from the usual volume term . by comparing the free energy of a lens - shaped critical nucleus of a finite contact angle with that of a spherical nucleus , we find that a spherical nucleus may have a lower free energy than a lens - shaped nucleus when the line tension is positive and large , which is similar to the drying transition predicted by widom [ b. widom , j. phys . </S>",
    "<S> chem . * 99 * 2803 ( 1995 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> then , the homogeneous nucleation rather than the heterogeneous nucleation will be favorable . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the free energy of a lens - shaped nucleus becomes negative when the line tension is negative and large . </S>",
    "<S> then , the barrier - less nucleation with no thermal activation called athermal nucleation will be realized . </S>"
