    "inspired by the lifshitz theory in condensed matter physics , horava ( 2009a , b ) has recently proposed a new theory of gravity based on an anisotropic scaling of space and time in the uv limit",
    ". usually referred to as horava - lifshitz ( hereafter , hl ) theory , the hl proposal shows a reduced invariance , dubbed _ foliation preserving diffeomorphism invariance _ , which however reduces to the standard one in the ir limit where general relativity is recovered . as an attractive feature",
    ", the hl theory turns out to be power counting renormalizable which has motivated the great interest in investigating with great detail its theoretical and cosmological aspects .",
    "it is worth remembering that , in its original formulation , two conditions were imposed in order to drive the choice of the field action .",
    "first , the _ projectability condition _ was supposed to hold true .",
    "since time plays a fundamental role from the very beginning , it was assumed that the lapse function ( defined when working in the adm formulation of gravity ) has to be a projectable function on the spacetime foliation , that is to say a function of time only .",
    "second , in order to reduce the number of independent terms entering the action , the principle of _ detailed balance _ was used .",
    "unfortunately , it soon became clear that this second condition leads to problems in the low energy limit @xcite thus motivating the search for modification of the original hl theory where the action breaks the detailed balance condition either softly @xcite or not .",
    "in particular , sotiriou , visser and weinfurtner ( 2009a , b ) have worked out a modified hl theory with no detailed balance condition imposing that only parity preserving operators enter the potential .",
    "although the discussion about the foundations and the possible conceptual and phenomenological problems of the hl theory and its modified versions is still open , it is nevertheless worth systematically investigating its consequences at every scale . in particular",
    ", it is interesting to study its static spherically symmetric solutions since one can thus derive the gravitational potential generated from a point mass source .",
    "recently , this problem has been addressed by tang & chen ( 2009 ) for the hl theory with the projectability condition and no detailed balance .",
    "they argue that only the minkowski or de sitter spacetime are solutions , but we will show here that this is actually not the case . as a consequence , we find that the gravitational potential generated by a point mass differs from the newtonian one because of the presence of additional terms depending on the hl coupling parameters .",
    "such terms have to be taken into account when computing the potential generated by an extended system , such as a galaxy .",
    "therefore , we work out a general formalism to estimate the rotation curve ( i.e. , the circular velocity @xmath4 as function of the distance @xmath5 from the centre ) for an extended source showing that the hl theory can boost the @xmath6 with respect to the newtonian value",
    ". motivated by this consideration , we then try to fit the milky way rotation curve using visible matter only to both constrain the hl parameters and investigating whether it can work as an effective dark matter component .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    ", we look for static spherically symmetric solutions for the hl theory with projecatibility condition and show that there is indeed a new solution leading to a modified gravitational potential . a general formalism to compute the rotation curve for an extended system",
    "is presented in sect.3 and then used in sect.4 to work out the predicted rotation curve for the milky way . here , we also present the data and the results of fitting them with our modified potential and no dark matter .",
    "conclusions are finally given in sect.5 .",
    "the weak field limit of the hl theory as proposed by sotiriou , visser and weinfurtner has been yet discussed by tang & chen ( 2009 , hereafter tc09 ) so that here we will only summarize the main steps and stress where our work differs from their one .",
    "as stressed in tc09 , we start from the observation that not all the static spherically symmetric solutions found for ( modifications of ) hl theory preserve the projectability condition . in fact , if one assumes a metric    @xmath7    with @xmath8 and use the coordinate transformation @xmath9dr$ ] , one can show that a necessary condition for the projectability condition to hold is that @xmath10 .",
    "the line element therefore reads :    @xmath11    the equations of motion for such a metric are given in tc09 and will not be repeated here for sake of shortness .",
    "the authors then argue that in the ir limit the @xmath12 function is constrained to be 1 thus ending up with the usual schwarzschild - de sitter metric as only solution .",
    "we here show that this is actually not the case . to this aim , we first note that the euler - lagrange equation for @xmath13 in the ir limit reduces to    @xmath14    which is solved by either @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "the first choice gives minkowski back when choosing @xmath17 and @xmath18 , or simply reduces to minkowski by means of a redefinition of the radial coordinate .",
    "the second choice seems therefore more interesting . in such a case ,",

    "we hence use this method to smooth the sample points and cut data with @xmath178 since the local regression method becomes unreliable for these points because of the sparseness of the sample in this region .",
    "we finally give it away points with @xmath179 where the threshold signal - to - noise ratio has been set to @xmath180 for reasons explained below .",
    "we will refer to this sample as the db data in the following .",
    "another possible tracer of the velocity field in the outer regions is represented by the blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars .",
    "photometry and spectra from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) for a sample of 2466 bhb stars allow to determine the rotation curve up to @xmath181 as described in xue et al .",
    "( 2008 , hereafter x08 ) . in order to extract @xmath6 taking care of all the possible projection effects and systematic biases ( due to , e.g. , the survey mask and targetting algorithm ) ,",
    "x08 have relied on mock matched observations based on two different cosmological simulations of mw - like galaxies . as such , there are two different datasets labelled as @xmath19 and @xmath182 depending on the simulation adopted .",
    "we here use only the @xmath19 dataset since it is in better agreement with the db sample over the range of overlap . note that this sample ( referred to hereafter as the sdss dataset )",
    "is made out of only 10 points obtained by binning the 2466 bhb stars in almost equally spaced radial bins covering the range @xmath183 .",
    "the s / n is quite high with a median value @xmath184 so that we set @xmath185 in order to give the same statistical weight to both datasets . as a final remark , we note that , while the db data probe only the outer disc being @xmath186 , the sdss sample extends mainly in the halo region most of the data having @xmath187 and extending up to @xmath188 . as such , the two sample",
    "nicely complement each other and allow us to check whether the outer rotation curve may be reproduced without any dark matter contribution and , at the same time , still preserving the agreement with the data in the disc region .      in order to constrain the hl model parameters ,",
    "we employ a standard bayesian approach first defining the likelihood function as :    @xmath189 } \\nonumber \\\\ ~ & = & \\exp{\\left \\ { - \\frac{1}{2 } \\sum{\\left [ \\frac{v_c^{obs}(r_i ) - v_c^{th}(r_i)}{\\varepsilon_i } \\right ] ^2 } \\right \\ } } \\label{eq : deflike}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath190 are he hl model parameters ) is not correct since the sdss data points are somewhat correlated being obtained by a binning procedure . however , since the bin spacing is quite large , it is likely that the correlation matrix ( not available ) is close to diagonal so that eq.([eq : deflike ] ) is essentially correct .",
    "] , @xmath191 and @xmath192 are the observed ( with a measurement error @xmath193 ) and theoretically predicted values of the circular velocity at the radius @xmath194 of the i - th point and the sum runs over the 101 db and 10 sdss data points .    the best fit is obtained by maximizing the likelihood @xmath195 , but it is worth stressing that , according to the bayesian philosophy , the best estimate of the parameter @xmath196 is not the best fit one . on the contrary , one has to marginalize over the remaining parameters and look at the shape of the marginalized likelihood function defined as :    @xmath197    with @xmath198 the total number of parameters .",
    "actually , what we do is running a monte carlo markov chain code to efficiently explore the three dimensional parameter space @xmath199 and use of the histogram of the values for the parameter @xmath196 to estimate the mean , the median and the @xmath200 and @xmath201 confidence ranges .",
    "note that , because of degeneracies among the model parameters , the best fit parameters @xmath202 may also differ from the maximum likelihood ones @xmath203 , i.e. the set obtained by maximizing each of the marginalized likelihood functions .      as a preliminary discussion",
    ", it is worth clearly stating which are the parameters we can constrain .",
    "eq.([eq : rotcurvegen ] shows that , in order to compute the hl contributions to the rotation curve , namely @xmath204 and @xmath205 , we must know the functional expression of @xmath87 entering @xmath206 through the scaling radii @xmath79 . since we do not know this function , we can not separately constrain the parameters @xmath207 .",
    "it is , however , easy to show that :    @xmath208    @xmath209    where we have defined :    @xmath210^{-1 } \\psi(\\mu ) d\\mu } } { \\int_{\\mu_{min}}^{\\mu_{max}}{\\psi(\\mu ) \\mu d\\mu } } \\ , \\ ] ]    @xmath211 \\left [ f(\\mu)/f_{\\odot } \\right ] ^{-1 } \\psi(\\mu ) d\\mu } } { \\int_{\\mu_{min}}^{\\mu_{max}}{\\psi(\\mu ) \\mu d\\mu } } \\ , \\ ] ]    while @xmath212 and @xmath213 are considered as constant parameter not depending on @xmath214 and we assume that @xmath215 and @xmath216 are evaluated setting @xmath217 in eq.([eq : rotcurvegen ] ) .",
    "our fit will then give constraints on @xmath218 , while those on @xmath219 could be derived provided a theoretically motivated functional expression for @xmath87 is given .",
    "skipping to logarithmic units to investigate a larger range , we run a single chain with 150000 points reduced to @xmath220 after cutting out the initial burn in phase and thinning the chain ( with a step of 10 ) to avoid spurious correlations .",
    "the best fit point turns out to be :    @xmath221    giving @xmath222 .",
    "needless to say , such a high reduced @xmath223 is a strong evidence against the hl model with no dark matter",
    ". a simple look at fig.[fig : bfplot ] shows that the large @xmath223 is due mainly to the sdss data .",
    "indeed , it is @xmath224 and @xmath225 for the db and sdss samples , respectively .",
    "although the model is clearly at odds with the data , we give below , for completeness , the constraints on the parameters from the analysis of their histograms along the chain .",
    "for @xmath226 we get :    @xmath227    @xmath228    while it is :    @xmath229    @xmath230    for @xmath231 . converting median values in linear units ,",
    "we get :    @xmath232    which allows us to make some qualitative interpretation of the results . considering the form of the potential for the point mass case , we see that only the first term can actually boost the stellar contribution to the rotation curve .",
    "this term essentially translates in a contribution to @xmath6 which linearly increases with @xmath233 so that @xmath234 must be small in order to fit the data in the db probed region without dark matter . on the other hand",
    ", a too small value may lead to a @xmath6 soon diverging thus spoiling down the agreement with the sdss data .",
    "the value @xmath235 we find is the result of this compromise , but it is nevertheless unable to reconcile the model with the sdss data .",
    "a similar compromise drives the fit in the estimates of @xmath231 . because of the scaling with @xmath1 in the point mass potential , the term entering @xmath236 may contribute to the outer region circular velocity only if @xmath236 is quite large .",
    "but , in such a case , @xmath237 will be much smaller than 1 in the inner regions thus making the contribution of this term to overcome by orders of magnitude the newtonian one in the regions where this latter is yet able to fit the data . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath236 must be small so that it does not contribute enough to boost @xmath4 with respect to the newtonian value hence motivating the need for a not too large @xmath234 .",
    "indeed , we find an almost linear correlation between @xmath226 and @xmath231 along the chain motivated by the fact that the larger is @xmath236 , the larger is the contribution to @xmath6 of the @xmath1 term of the potential and hence the smaller is the need for the @xmath0 term which translates in a larger @xmath234 .",
    "initially motivated by its attractive features from the point of view of quantum gravity , the hl proposal has soon become one of the most investigated theories of gravity .",
    "we have here complemented recent works on its cosmological consequences by addressing its impact on the gravitational potential .",
    "contrary to the claim in tc09 , we have demonstrated that static spherically symmetric solutions other than the schwartzschild - de sitter one exist . as a consequence",
    ", we have found a modified gravitational potential made out of the newtonian @xmath2 one corrected by the addition of three further terms scaling as @xmath0 , which corresponds to the effect of a cosmological constant , and a quickly decreasing term , proportional to @xmath238 .",
    "the importance of these two terms is parametrized in terms of two conveniently defined scaling radii , namely @xmath79 , related to the couplings entering the hl lagrangian . in order to consider astrophysically interesting situations ,",
    "we have then developed a general formalism to compute the circular velocity curve provided the mass density and the mass function of the system are given .",
    "as an application , we have then evaluated the milky way rotation curve using as only source of the gravitational field a spheroidal truncated power - law bulge and a double exponential disc .",
    "it turns out that the modified rotation curve is unable to fit the data thus demonstrating that the hl theory can not play the role of an alterative solution to the missing mass problem .",
    "it is worth noting that mukohyama ( 2009 ) has shown that classical solutions to the infrared ( ir ) limit of the hl theory can mimic general relativity plus cold dark matter so that one can argue that it should be possible for the hl theory to provide an effective dark matter halo in apparent contradiction with our finding .",
    "actually , this is not the case .",
    "first , mukohyama only refers to the hl ir limit so that the lagrangian he has considered does not include any potential term , while we here explicitly include this term through the coupling parameters @xmath62 .",
    "second , the cold dark matter term comes out as a consequence of the global hamiltonian constraint being less restrictive than the local one typically imposed in general relativity . in our static spherically",
    "symmetric metric , the global hamiltonian constraint reduces to eq.([eq : ss2 ] ) . in order to find our solution",
    ", we then impose that the integrand in eq.([eq : ss1 ] ) identically vanishes so that we are actually converting the global constraint in a local one thus going back to a situation similar to the general relativity case . as a consequence ,",
    "we argue that the possibility to get a matter term as an integration constant is lost in our approach .",
    "the next step in our analysis of the hl theory on galactic scale should naturally be the inclusion of a dark halo .",
    "there are however some subtle issues making such a logical step forward not so easy to address .",
    "first , needless to say , there are few hints on which the dark halo mass density profile should be .",
    "all the models used in literature are motivated by the outcome of numerical simulations , such as , e.g. , the popular nfw @xcite and einasto @xcite , or evidences from rotation curve fitting , such as the isothermal sphere @xcite and the burkert @xcite profile .",
    "all the previous works implicitly assume the validity of the newtonian potential so that they are no more valid in a modified framework as the one we are using here . as a consequence",
    ", we have therefore to explore a wide class of density profile able to mimic most of the models in literature to finally select the most empirically motivated one . moreover , as eq.([eq : rotcurvegen ] ) shows , we also need to know the dark matter mass function which is completely unknown",
    ". should the dark matter be composed of pointlike particles all having the same mass , we can adopt a dirac @xmath239 leaving the mass of the particle as an unknown or setting it according to some particle physics model . as a final consequence",
    ", the fit to the rotation curve should determine the three hl scaling parameters @xmath79 and @xmath240 halo parameters so that severe degeneracies among these @xmath240 quantities may take place . in order to reduce them",
    ", a better way should be to consider external galaxies rotation curves assuming that the mf is the same as the mw one .",
    "in such a way , we could take advantage of the data probing the full radial range and not only the outer disc as done here with the mw sample .",
    "moreover , such a test can also probe the universality of the scaling radii @xmath79 thus providing a further mandatory test of the hl model .    as a final remark",
    ", we want to stress that , should such an analysis be successful , one has still to address a different issue . let us suppose that we have indeed well fitted the rotation curves of a large sample of spiral galaxies thus determining a halo model and the values of @xmath79 .",
    "one could then use eqs.([eq : defhlpar ] ) and ( [ eq : defradii ] ) to infer constraints on the hl coupling parameters @xmath241 .",
    "although we have thus five constraints ( the two radii plus the two conditions imposed in the derivation of the potential ) so being unable to determine all the eight quantities @xmath241 , one could nevertheless try to see whether the allowed region of the parameter space is consistent with what is inferred from cosmological analyses @xcite or solar sytem tests ( see e.g. iorio & ruggiero 2009 and references therein ) .",
    "it is worth noting that such an attempt should give a consistent picture of the hl framework on all physical scales thus allowing to draw a deeper insight into its viability .",
