    "the hot and cold dark matter cosmology @xcite has been served as one of the rival models which solves the problem of structure formation in the universe in a consistent way with observation of fluctuation of cosmoc microwave background radiation and galaxy correlations @xcite .",
    "while the necessity of the hot component of the dark matter becomes less prominent in the light of recent observations @xcite the problem still remains as to what extent the possible dark matter neutrinos can have a `` market share '' in the cosmos .",
    "moreover , the possibility that neutrinos have masses of a few ev range , if realized in nature , should shed light on underlying physics of neutrino mass , the unique hint to date for physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles .    in this talk ,",
    "i examine the question of neutrinos with masses of ev scale which is suitable for cosmological hot dark matter .",
    "i assume the three - flavor mixing scheme of leptons in the standard model .",
    "it is important to emphasize that two robust evidences in favor of neutrino oscillations , the atmospheric @xcite and the solar neutrino @xcite anomalies perfectly fit into the three - flavor mixing scheme .",
    "while the lsnd experiments @xcite suggests that the scheme is too tight , i would like to wait for the confirmation by independent experiments before deciding to go beyond the three - flavor framework .",
    "i will use , throughout this article , the standard particle data group notation for the elements of lepton flavor mixing matrix , the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix @xcite .",
    "i will convey you , in this talk , mainly the following three messages :    \\(i ) the standard three - neutrino mixing scheme , in which two @xmath1 are assigned to the atmospheric and the solar neutrino oscillations , is robust .",
    "i will describe an attempt at challenging to this conventional wisdom but i will badly fail .",
    "\\(ii ) the above fact seems to indicate that if the neutrinos have dark matter mass of a few ev they must be almost degenerate in masses .",
    "i discuss the powerful constraints imposed on such almost degenerate neutrino ( adn ) scenario by cosmological observations and by the neutrinoless double @xmath2 decay experiments .",
    "\\(iii ) i then move on to the question of mass pattern of neutrinos .",
    "i will address one of the key questions among the remaining problems in the three - neutrino mixing scheme , namely the sign of @xmath3 .",
    "i point out that observation of neutrinos from supernova will tell us about it @xcite .",
    "let me start by introducing the first problem mentioned in ( i ) . since this is a dark matter conference , it is natural to raise the following question ; is it possible to embed @xmath4 into the three - neutrino mixing scheme ?",
    "well , the answer appears to be trivially no ! as far as one wants to keep @xmath5 and @xmath6 which exhaust the available two @xmath1 in 3 @xmath0 scheme . the only way out of the dilemma is to give up one of the two @xmath1 in favor of @xmath4 , but in such a way that the resuting scheme is still capable of explaining the atmospheric and the solar neutrino observations .",
    "of course , it would not be possible to account for all the aspects of the data and probably we must live with e.g. , the energy - independent deficit by a factor of @xmath7 2 in solar neutrinos @xcite , probably at the price of sacrificing one of the 4 solar neutrino experiments .",
    "but , it is still highly nontrivial to prove or refute the possibility that such scenario exists in a consistent manner with all the other constraints .",
    "so , let me try .    in the following ,",
    "i examine scenarios of 3 @xmath0 mixing in which the first @xmath1 is assigned to @xmath4 and the second to @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "one has to recognize , first of all , that such scenario is strongly constrained by the reactor and the accelerator experiments . as noticed in refs .",
    "@xcite there are only three tiny regions on parameter space spanned by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as schematically indicated in fig . 1 :    \\(a ) @xmath10 and @xmath9 is arbitrary    \\(b ) @xmath11 and @xmath12    \\(c ) @xmath11 and @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of the order of a few @xmath16 for a value of @xmath4 which is appropriate for hot dark matter .",
    "if you want to know more precise shape of the allowed region for a given value of @xmath4 , see ref .",
    "therefore , the two mixing angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 are essentially determined depending upon your choice of the regions in ( a ) - ( c ) .",
    "next i must decide which option i take ; assignment of remaining @xmath1 to either @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "once i decide the option the scenario is completely determined up to the arbitrary parameter @xmath17 .",
    "then , by adjusting @xmath17 i try to explain all the data of the solar and the atmospheric neutrino observations under the constraints of the terrestrial experiments .",
    "i do not try to describe the details of the actual process of the analysis but summarize the results in table 1 . in the table",
    "the symbols `` n '' and `` i '' refer to the normal and the inverted mass hierarchies respectively , which imply mass patterns , n ( normal ) : @xmath18 and i ( inverted ) : @xmath19 . the regions ( a)-(c ) ( in order from above )",

    "the fact that we badly fail in our attempt at incorporating @xmath4 into 3 @xmath0 scheme strongly suggests that the standard three - flavor mixing scheme is robust .",
    "then , the only way to accommodate the dark matter mass neutrinos is to assume that three @xmath0 states are almost degenerate with masses of a few ev range @xcite , the almost degenerate neutrino ( adn ) scenario @xcite .",
    "the adn scenario is the most natural possibility if all of the three mixing angles are large . at the moment",

    "the adn scenario can be constrained by cosmological observations as well as by laboratory experiments .",
    "the latter includes the direct mass measurement using @xmath2 decay end point spectrum , and the neutrinoless double @xmath2 decay experiments .    since a few ev mass neutrinos play important role in cosmology",
    "it is conceivable that it is constrained by cosmological observations .",
    "this is a natural place where one can place a bound on neutrino masses because the streaming motion of light neutrinos washes out seeds for structure formations at small scales .",
    "in fact , it is argued by fukugita , liu , and sugiyama @xcite that it is the case ; they used matching condition of flucutuation powers at cobe and clusters scales as the most sensitive probe and obtained @xmath32 ev depending upon @xmath33 at the hubble parameter 80 in units of 100 km s@xmath34 mpc@xmath34 .",
    "this type of treatment should be valid for dark matter massive neutrinos with more generic mass spectrum , with which the similar bound presumably results .",
    "the bound of course applies both to dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "let us move on to the laboratory bound .",
    "i discuss here only the double @xmath2 decay bound because it achieves the greatest sensitivity among the laboratory experiments .",
    "of course , the double @xmath2 bound only applies to majorana neutrinos .",
    "there is a simple reason why the experiment gives rise to nontrivial constraints on neutrino mixing parameters .",
    "the dark matter motivated adn scenario requires the neutrino mass of the order of @xmath7 a few ev . on the other hand ,",
    "the sensitivity of the double @xmath2 decay experiments went down to less than 0.5 ev .",

    "observable in the neutrinoless double @xmath2 decay experiments can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the elements of the mns matrix @xcite . under the adn approximaion , @xmath37 ( i=1 - 3 ) and by using the standard parametrization by partcle data group , it can be written as @xmath38 where @xmath2 and @xmath39 are the extra cp - violating phases characteristic to majorana neutrinos . since @xmath40 there must be cancellation between three angle factors in ( [ beta1 ] ) .",
    "the resulting constraint has first been examined in ref .",
    "@xcite in a manner completely independent of unknown majorana phases and it was shown that the adn scenario is inconsistent with the sma msw solar neutrino solution .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an update . ) later , the similar analyses have been repeated or extended by a number of authors who exploit newer ( more stringent ) constraint , or cover a wider class of solar neutrino solutions and/or more general mass patterns @xcite .",
    "i take the chance of presentation at dark2000 to update our analysis done in ref .",
    "it is timely to do reanalysis _ now _ because the most stringent bound on @xmath41 provided by the heidelberg - moscow group has been changed to @xmath42 as announced at this conference @xcite , which is relaxed by a factor of @xmath7 2 compared with the previous one .",
    "therefore , constraints derived in some of the earlier analyses can be artificial .",
    "we obtain the parameter region allowed by the bound ( [ heidelberg - moscow ] ) with use of the degenerate neutrino mass @xmath43 ev , the lowest mass in pogosyan - starobinsky analysis @xcite .",
    "notice that it is the case of mildest constraint . in fig .",
    "2 we draw a hexagon - shaped region allowed by the double @xmath2 decay experiment ( assuming no constraint on unknown majorana phases ) together with parameter region allowed for the msw solution of solar neutrino problem on the solar triangle plot introduced by the bari group @xcite . for the solar neutrino allowed region we also use the updated results by the group @xcite .",
    "we observe :    \\(1 ) all the msw solutions of the solar neutrino problem is excluded at @xmath7 1 @xmath44 level in the adn scenario , except for the low solution ; its allowed region bridges between the lma region and the bottom of the hexagon .",
    "\\(2 ) the lma msw solution barely survives only when we take into account of the factor of 2 uncertainty in estimation of the nuclear matrix elements .",
    "\\(3 ) the vacuum solution is obviously consistent with the double @xmath2 bound because it spans a wide region at the lowest quarter of the double @xmath2 hexagon due to the nearly maximal @xmath17 ; wide region because of the freedom from the chooz bound .",
    "see , e.g. , ref . @xcite .",
    "this statement presumably generalizes to the `` quasi - vacuum '' solution @xcite .",
    "now let us turn the argument around .",
    "namely , i try to derive the upper bound on degenerate neutrino mass which is consistent with the lma msw solution , the best favored solution by the data at this moment . by looking into fig . 3",
    "one can safely argue that @xmath45 in order to have overlapping region between the allowed regions by the double @xmath2 and the solar neutrino data .",
    "it implies the upper bound @xmath46 in the adn scenario .",
    "if a factor of @xmath47 undertainty of the nuclear matrix elements is taken into account , the bound would become loosen by the same factor .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cosmology argument by fukugita et al . @xcite and",
    "our double @xmath2 bound give numerically similar upper bounds while the physics and the underlying assumptions involved differ completely .",
    "i also want to stress that , given the present accuracy of the experimental bound ( of the order of @xmath48 a few @xmath49 0.1 ev ) the estimation of mass bound with the adn assumption is not so bad as an order of magnitude estimation even for hierarchical spectrum .",
    "i should also emphasize that this will no longer be true when the bound goes down to @xmath48 0.01 ev because it is below @xmath50 and starts to distinguish the various mass patterns .",
    "now we address the last point ( iii ) mentioned at the beginning of this article , namely the issue of normal vs. inverted hierarchies of neutrino masses .",
    "i guess that it is one of the most important questions in the 3 @xmath0 mixing scheme which presumably will provide the key to understand the underlying physics of neutrino mass spectrum .",
    "furthermore , it is the crucial question for the neutrinoless double @xmath2 decay experimentalists .",
    "the required sensitivities for detecting positive signal are @xmath51 ev and @xmath52 ev for the normal and the inverted mass hierarchies , respectively @xcite .",
    "now i want to point out that observation of neutrino events from supernova ( sn ) provides us with a mean for discriminating the normal vs. the inverted mass hierarchies .",
    "furthermore , i argue that the inverted hierarchy of neutrino mass is strongly disfavored by the neutrino data from sn1987a @xcite unless the mixing angle @xmath31 is very small , that is , unless @xmath53 a few @xmath54 @xcite . of course , this conclusion must be checked against the direct determination of the sign of @xmath55 which may be done in future long - baseline accelerator experiments @xcite .",
    "however , the result we have obtained appears to be the unique hint which is available before such experiments are actually done .    toward the goal of showing that the inverted mass hierarchy is disfavored",
    ", i must first explain some key features of neutrino flavor conversion in sn . for more detailed explanation",
    "see our recent paper @xcite .",
    "\\(1 ) consideration of energetics of sn collapse indicates that almost all ( @xmath56 ) of the gravitational binding energy of neutron star is radiated away via neutrino emission .",
    "the total energy is estimated to be several @xmath57 erg , and it is expected that the equipartition of energy into three flavors in a good approximation @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) it is discussed that the shape of the energy spectra of various flavor neutrinos can be described by a `` pinched '' fermi - dirac distribution @xcite",
    ". the pinched form may be parametrized by introducing an effective `` chemical potential '' .",
    "\\(3 ) there is no physical distinction between @xmath58 and @xmath59 and their antiparticles in neutrinosphere .",
    "it is because @xmath58 and @xmath60 are not energetic enough to produce muons by the charged current interactions , and the neutral current cross sections of @xmath0 and @xmath61 are similar in magnitude .",
    "therefore , we collectively denote them as `` heavy neutrinos '' hereafter .",
    "\\(4 ) the location of neutrinosphere of heavy neutrinos , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , is believed to be in deeper place than @xmath62 and @xmath63 in sn .",
    "it is due to the fact that the heavy neutrinos have weaker interactions with surrounding matter ; they interact with matter only via the weak neutral current , whereas , @xmath62 and @xmath63 do have additional charged current interactions .",
    "hence , the heavy neutrinos have to have deeper neutrinosphere because their trapping requires higher matter density compared to those required for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this last feature is of crucial importance for our business .",
    "it implies that the heavy neutrinos are more energetic when they are radiated off at neutrinosphere because the temperature is higher in denser region .",
    "it may be characterized by the temperature ratios of @xmath64 and @xmath65 to @xmath66 @xmath67 according to the simulation of supernova dynamics which is carried out in ref .",
    "we ignore in the present treatment the temperature difference between @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we now turn to the the neutrino flavor conversion in supernova ( sn ) , the core matter in our discussion in this part of my presentation .",
    "in fact , it has a number of characteristic features which makes sn unique among other astrophysical and terrestrial sources .",
    "\\(i ) because of extremely high matter density inside neutrinosphere all the neutrinos with cosmologically interesting mass range , @xmath70 ev , are affected by the msw effect @xcite .",
    "( earlier references on the msw effect in supernova include ref .",
    "consequently , the three neutrino and three antineutrino eigenstates have two level crossings , first at higher ( h ) density and the second at lower ( l ) density , inside sn as schematically indicated in fig .",
    "\\(ii ) the key question in the neutrino flavor conversion in sn is whether the h level crossing is adiabatic or not .",
    "if it is adiabatic , then the physical properties of neutrino conversion is simply @xmath71 exchange in the normal mass hierarchy .",
    "it should be emphasized that this feature holds irrespective of the possible complexity of the solar neutrino conversion which governs the l resonance .",
    "these are nothing but the key features that have been pointed out in our earlier paper , ref .",
    "@xcite , and was called as `` @xmath64-@xmath59 exchange '' .",
    "\\(iii ) the second important question is if the neutrino mass spectrum adopts the normal or inverted mass hierarchies .",
    "if the mass hierarchies is of normal ( inverted ) type , the h level crossing is in the neutrino ( antineutrino ) channel .",
    "the last two remarks are cruicial in our business .",
    "it will allow us to determine which mass hierarchy is realized by analyzing neutrino data from sn without knowing the parameters in the solar neutrino solution .",
    "notice that this statement is valid not only for the msw but also for the vacuum solar neutrino solutions .",
    "one can elaborate ( ii ) by treating the neutrino evolution equation in high density matter of sn envelope , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite . see also ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent complehensive treatment of neutrino flavor conversion in sn in the framework of three - flavor mixing .",
    "the adiabaticity of the h resonance is guaranteed if the following adiabaticity parameter @xmath39 is much larger than unity at the resonance point : @xmath72^{1/n } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , we assumed that the density profile of the relevant region of the star can be described as @xmath73 to obtain the second line in the above equation , where @xmath74 cm denotes the solar radius . with the choice @xmath75 and @xmath76 g / cc @xcite",
    ", we get , @xmath77\\   \\left [ \\frac{\\delta m^2}{10^{-3 } \\text{ev}^2 }   \\right]^{2/3 } \\left [ \\frac{e}{20\\ \\text{mev } } \\right]^{-2/3},\\ ] ] for the small value of @xmath31 .",
    "since the conversion probability @xmath78 is approximately given by @xmath79 $ ] , @xmath80 assures adiabaticity in a good accuracy .",
    "now we notice that the basic elements for the argument toward disfavoring inverted mass hierarchy is actually very simple .",
    "because of ( iii ) , the resonance is in the antineutrino channel if the inverted mass hierarchy is the case as illustrated in fig .",
    "it means that , if the h resonance is adiabatic , all the @xmath65 s at neutrinosphere are converted into heavy antineutrino states , and vice versa .",
    "it is also known @xcite that if h resonance is adiabatic , final @xmath65 spectrum at the detector is not affected by the earth matter effect .",
    "state which carry the original @xmath65 spectrum oscillate very little into @xmath65 in the earth because @xmath81 is much larger than the earth matter potential and also because @xmath31 is small @xcite .",
    "therefore , the oscillation in the earth takes place essentially only between @xmath82 and @xmath83 , decoupling the @xmath84 state .",
    "it would lead to regeneration of @xmath65 but it would not give any significant effect for the @xmath65 component at the detector because both @xmath82 and @xmath83 carry original energy spectrum of heavy flavors at the neutrinosphere . ]",
    "since the @xmath65-induced charged current reaction is dominant in water cherenkov detector , one can severely constrain the scenario of inverted mass hierarchy by utilizing this feature of neutrino flavor transformation in sn .",
    "when the next supernova event comes it can be used to make clear judgement on whether the inverted mass hierarchy is realized in nature , a completely independent information from those that will be obtained by the long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments ,    we show in the rest of my talk that by analyzing the neutrino data from sn1987a one can obtain a rather strong feeling against the inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses . in the following analysis , we assume that @xmath85 is not very small , @xmath86 , to guarantee the adiabaticity of the h resonance .",
    "in fact , very similar analyses have been done by several authors @xcite .",
    "our work , in comparison with theirs , may be characterized in the following way ; we formulate the problem in a proper setting of the three - flavor mixing scheme of neutrinos , which is essential for the sn neutrinos . with this setting one",
    "can clearly identify the cases that the conclusion reached in the previous analyses does and does not apply . to our understanding disfavoring",
    "the inverted mass hierarchy is the most solid statement one can draw from the analysis of sn1987a data , assuming that @xmath31 is not extremely small .",
    "we follow jegerlehner , neubig and raffelt @xcite who employed the method of maximum likelihood .",
    "we define the likelihood function as follows @xcite : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the total number of experimentally observed events and the @xmath89 is some constant which is irrelevant for our purpose of parameter estimation and the determination of confidence regions . here , @xmath90 is the expected positron energy spectrum at kamiokande or imb detector which is computed taking into account the detector efficiency as well as energy resolution in the same way as in ref .",
    "for a comined analysis of the kamiokande and imb detectors , the likelihood function is defined as the product of the likelihood function for each detector .",
    "we draw in fig .",
    "5 equal likelihood contours as a function of the heavy to light temperature ratio @xmath91 on the space spanned by @xmath65 temperature and total neutrino luminosity by giving the neutrino events from sn1987a observed by kamiokande and imb detectors @xcite .",
    "in addition to it we introduce an extra parameter @xmath92 defined by @xmath93 which describe the departure from equipartition of energies to three neutrino species and examine the sensitivity of our conclusion against the change in the sn neutrino spectrum . for simplicity , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we set the `` effective '' chemical potential equal to zero in the neutrino distribution functions because we believe that our results would not depend much even if we introduce some non - zero chemical potential .    at @xmath94 ,",
    "that is at equal @xmath95 and @xmath64 temperatures , the 95 @xmath96 likelihood contour marginally overlaps with the theoretical expectation @xcite represented by the shadowed box in fig .",
    "5 . when the temperature ratio @xmath91 is varied from unity to 2 the likelihood contour moves to the left , indicating less and less consistency , as @xmath91 increases , between the standard theoretical expectation and the observed feature of the neutrino events after the msw effect in sn is taken into account .",
    "this is simply because the observed energy spectrum of @xmath65 must be interpreted as that of the original one of @xmath97 , in the presence of the msw effect in the anti - neutrino chanel , which implies that the original @xmath65 temperature must be lower by a factor @xmath91 than the observed one , leading to stronger inconsistency at larger @xmath91 .    the solid lines in fig . 5 are for the case of equipartition of energy into three flavors , @xmath98 , whereas the dotted and the dashed lines are for @xmath99 and 1.3 , respectively .",
    "we observe that our result is very insensitive against the change in @xmath92 .",
    "we conclude that if the temperature ratio @xmath91 is in the range 1.4 - 2.0 as the sn simulations indicate , the inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses is disfavored by the neutrino data of sn1987a unless the h resonance is nonadiabatic @xcite .              to conclude",
    ", i would like to say that the dark matter neutrino hypothesis has had profound implications to stimulate many inspirations in neutrino physics , despite the fact that the chance for it being the reality became less likely now .",
    "yet , the question of neutrino mass of a few ev range , which is still compatible with data , should be settled both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "i thank hans v. klapdor - kleingrthaus for cordial invitation to the conference with quite stimulating atmosphere that took place in such a beautiful city .",
    "the subjects i presented in my talk are partly based on the collaborating works with hiroshi nunokawa and osamu yasuda .",
