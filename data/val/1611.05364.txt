    "the empirical eigenvalue measure of a large random matrix is typically well approximated by a deterministic asymptotic measure .",

    "@xmath9 is the stieltjes transform of the asymptotic eigenvalue measure , which we denote by @xmath10 .",
    "we call an estimate of the form an _ averaged law_.    as may be easily seen by taking the imaginary part of , control of the convergence of @xmath6 yields control of an order @xmath11 eigenvalues around the point @xmath12 . a",
    "_ local law _ is an estimate of the form for all @xmath13 .",
    "note that the approximation can not be correct at or below the scale @xmath14 , at which the behaviour of the left - hand side of is governed by the fluctuations of individual eigenvalues .",
    "local laws have become a cornerstone of random matrix theory , starting from the work @xcite where a local law was first established for wigner matrices .",
    "local laws constitute the main tool needed to analyse the distribution of the eigenvalues of random matrices , including the universality of the local spectral statistics and the proof of the celebrated wigner - dyson - mehta conjecture @xcite , and the eigenvectors of random matrices , including eigenvector delocalization and the distribution of the eigenvector components .",
    "in fact , for the aforementioned applications to the distribution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors , the averaged local law from is not sufficient .",
    "one has to control not only the normalized trace of @xmath15 but the matrix @xmath15 itself , by showing that @xmath15 is close to some deterministic matrix , @xmath16 , provided that @xmath13 .",
    "as the dimension @xmath8 of these matrices is very large , which notion of closeness to use is a nontrivial question .",
    "the control of @xmath17 as a matrix was initiated in @xcite in the context of wigner matrices , where the individual matrix entries @xmath18 are controlled .",
    "we call such a result an _ entrywise local law_. subsequently , the entrywise local law of @xcite has been refined and significantly generalized @xcite .    more generally , canonical notions are closeness in the _ weak operator sense _ , _ strong operator sense _ , and _",
    "norm sense _ , which entail control of @xmath19 respectively , for deterministic @xmath20 .",
    "it is easy to see that already convergence in the strong operator sense must fail , as one typically has @xmath21 ; we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 12.1 ) for more details .",
    "we conclude that control in the weak operator sense , i.e.   of @xmath22 , is the strongest form of control that one may expect to hold for the error @xmath17 .",
    "following @xcite we call such a result an _ ( an)isotropic local law_. ( an)isotropic local laws have played a central role in the study of deformed matrix ensembles @xcite and the distribution of eigenvector components of random matrices @xcite .",
    "all proofs of local laws consist of at least the two following major steps , which are completely decoupled .    1 .   _ a stochastic step _ establishing a self - consistent equation for @xmath15 with a random error term .",
    "2 .   _ a deterministic step _ analysing the stability of the self - consistent equation .    step ( a ) may be formulated in general as follows .",
    "there is a map @xmath23 such that @xmath16 is uniquely charaterized as the solution of the equation @xmath24 with positive imaginary part . for a large class of random matrices , including those considered in this paper",
    ", @xmath25 is a nonlinear quadratic function .",
    "step ( a ) provides high - probability bounds on the matrix @xmath26 ( in some suitable sense ) .    in step ( b )",
    "one shows that if @xmath27 is small then so is @xmath17 .    in general ,",
    "both steps are nontrivial .",
    "in addition , steps ( a ) and ( b ) have up to now only been used to derive an entrywise local law ; to obtain a full ( an)isotropic local law , a further nontrivial argument was necessary ; three different techniques for deriving ( an)isotropic laws from entrywise laws were developed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a new method for dealing with step ( a ) , which has the following advantages as compared to previous approaches .    1",
    ".   it can handle very general mean - field random matrices @xmath0 , and is in particular completely insensitive to the expectation @xmath28 .",
    "( previous methods heavily rely on the assumption that @xmath28 is diagonal or close to diagonal . ) 2 .",
    "it automatically yields the ( an)isotropic law in one step , without requiring a further intermediate step via an entrywise law , as in @xcite .",
    "3 .   it is simple and very versatile . it is applicable to many matrix models where previous methods either fail or are very cumbersome .    for conciseness , in this paper",
    "we focus on mean - field hermitian random matrices whose upper - triangular entries are independent . by _",
    "mean - field _ we mean that @xmath29 for all @xmath30 .",
    "we make no assumption on @xmath28 .",
    "we remark that our method extends to very general matrices built from independent random variables , such as sample covariance matrices built from populations with arbitrary expectations and covariances .",
    "we now outline our main results . throughout the paper we split @xmath31",
    "we define the map @xmath32\\,.\\ ] ] then it is not hard to show that for @xmath33 , the equation @xmath24 has a unique solution @xmath16 with positive imaginary part ( see lemma [ lem : sol_pi ] below ) .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ thm : main_general ] below ) is the derivation of the self - consistent equation @xmath34 : we establish high - probability bounds on the quantities @xmath35 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath36 is a bounded deterministic matrix and @xmath37 are deterministic .",
    "these bounds are sharp ( up to some technicalities in the definition of a high probability bound ) throughout the spectrum , in both the bulk and in the vicinity of regular edges where the density of the limiting measure @xmath10 exhibits the characteristic square - root decay of random matrix theory .",
    "we emphasize that we make no assumption on the expectation @xmath38 .",
    "our main result performs step ( a ) for the general class of mean - field random matrices introduced above . to illustrate how this result",
    "may be combined with step ( b ) to complete the proof of the ( an)isotropic local law , we use our main result to settle in complete generality the local law for wigner matrices with arbitrary expectation ( theorem [ thm : wigner ] below ) , i.e.  @xmath39 with arbitrary expectation @xmath40 .",
    "previously , the local law for wigner matrices with nonzero expectation was derived under the assumption that @xmath40 is diagonal @xcite or that all third moments of @xmath41 vanish @xcite .",
    "even the averaged local law for general @xmath40 was not accessible using previous methods .    in this paper we do not perform step ( b ) ( the stability analysis of the self - consistent equation @xmath34 ) for the aforementioned general class of mean - field matrices . for general @xmath0",
    "this is a nontrivial task , and we refer to the works @xcite , where a related analysis is performed to obtain an entrywise law for the case of almost diagonal @xmath40 .",
    "we remark that the map @xmath25 defined in has been extensively studied in the random matrix literature , starting with @xcite , where its stability was analysed on the global spectral scale .",
    "recently , it has been the focus of the seminal series of works @xcite mentioned above , where the stability of the matrix equation @xmath24 was analysed in great detail in order to establish local laws for a general class of random matrix ensembles .",
    "we conclude this introductory section with a few words about the proof .",
    "traditionally , in all of the works @xcite , the proof of step ( a ) for matrices with independent entries relied on schur s complement formula .",
    "when applicable , schur s complement formula provides a direct approach to proving step ( a ) .",
    "however , its applicability to random matrix models is heavily dependent on the independence of the entries of @xmath41 and on the fact that @xmath40 is diagonal .",
    "if the mapping between the independent random variables and the entries of @xmath0 is nontrivial or if @xmath40 is not diagonal , the use of schur s complement formula becomes more cumbersome and possibly even fruitless .",
    "moreover , schur s complement formula is only effective when deriving entrywise estimates , and it is ill - suited for deriving isotropic estimates .",
    "the first proof of a local law without using schur s complement formula was @xcite , where a local law was established for random regular graphs ( which are not built from independent random variables ) . in @xcite ,",
    "schur s complement formula was replaced by a much more robust expansion using the resolvent identity .",
    "our current approach is in part motivated by this philosophy : instead of working with entire rows and columns , as dictated by schur s complement formula , we work with individual matrix entries . a natural way of achieving this is to perform a series of expansions using the resolvent identity , where @xmath15 is expanded in a single entry of @xmath41 .",
    "we remark that such ideas have previously been used in the somewhat different context of proving the so - called fluctuation averaging result in random matrix theory ; see @xcite .    in practice",
    ", we choose to replace the resolvent expansion with a cumulant expansion inspired by @xcite ( see lemma [ lem : cumulant_expansion ] below ) , which effectively performs the same steps but in a more streamlined fashion .",
    "a drawback of the cumulant expansion is that it requires working with expectations of random variables instead of just random variables .",
    "this leads us to consider high moments of error terms , which are estimated self - consistently .",
    "an analogous strategy was first used in @xcite to prove the isotropic local law for wigner matrices , although there the moments were estimated by the green function comparison strategy instead of the cumulant expansion used in this paper .",
    "the first use of recursive self - consistent estimates for high moments using the cumulant expansion , including exploiting a cancellation among two leading terms , was @xcite ; this strategy constitutes the core of our method .",
    "the cumulant expansion was first used to derive a local law in the recent work @xcite , where a precise averaged law was derived for sparse random matrices with @xmath42 .",
    "analogous ideas for the haar measure on the unitary group were recently exploited in @xcite to obtain optimal bounds on the convergence rate for the spectral distribution of the sum of random matrices . historically , the first use of the cumulant expansion for local spectral statistics is @xcite , where edge universality and the tracy - widom limit for deformed wigner matrices was proved , along with a streamlined proof of the edge universality for wigner matrices .    aside from the novel idea of using the resolvent / cumulant expansion to prove ( an)isotropic local laws for random matrices with independent entries ,",
    "the key new ingredients of our method may be summarized as follows .    1 .   we bootstrap isotropic bounds on the green function , i.e.  our proof makes use of a priori bounds of the form @xmath43 with high probability . when using the cumulant expansion ( or , alternatively , the resolvent expansion ) , we are naturally led to sums of the form @xmath44 .",
    "it is crucial to first perform the sum over @xmath45 to exploit the isotropic a priori bounds on @xmath15 ; simply estimating the sum term by term leads to errors which are not affordable .",
    "reducing such sums to isotropic estimates on the green function requires a certain amount of care .",
    "2 .   a direct application of the cumulant expansion to estimating high moments of the error results in terms that can not be controlled with a high enough precision . to circumvent this issue , we use multiple self - improving matrix bounds at several stages of the proof .",
    "we assume a rough a priori bound on an error matrix and derive a self - improving bound on it , which may be iterated to obtain the optimal bound .",
    "see e.g.   or below for an example . for the estimate of @xmath46",
    "$ ] , we apply this approach to a matrix that we call @xmath47 , defined in below .",
    "the identification of @xmath47 as a central object of the proof and the derivation of optimal bounds on it by means of a self - improving scheme obtained from a second cumulant expansion is a key idea of our proof .",
    "the central objects of this paper , such as the green function @xmath15 , depend on @xmath48 and the spectral parameter @xmath49 .",
    "we frequently omit both arguments , writing for instance @xmath15 instead of @xmath50 .",
    "if some quantity does not depend on @xmath8 , we indicate this explicitly by calling it _ constant _ or _",
    "fixed_. we always use the notation @xmath4 for the real and imaginary parts of @xmath51 .",
    "we use the usual @xmath52 notation , and write @xmath53 if the implicit constant depends on the parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the parameter @xmath54 can never depend on @xmath8 or @xmath51 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath55 for vectors , @xmath56 for the scalar product @xmath57 and @xmath58 for the euclidean norm .",
    "we denote by @xmath59 the euclidean operator norm of an @xmath1 matrix @xmath36 .",
    "we write @xmath60 for the normalized trace of @xmath36 .",
