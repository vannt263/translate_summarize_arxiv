    "main - sequence stars located in active star forming regions ( @xcite , 1977 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "roughly half of the 11 commonly accepted fuors have been observed to rise 35 mag in optical or near - ir brightness on timescales of 110 yr .",
    "other fuors have been identified based on properties similar to eruptive fuors , including ( i ) absorption features of f ",
    "g supergiants on optical spectra and k ",
    "m giants on near - ir spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; ( ii ) large excesses of radiation over normal f  g stars at ultraviolet , infrared , submillimeter , and centimeter wavelengths ( @xcite , 1991 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; ( iii ) distinctive reflection nebulae ( @xcite ) ; and ( iv ) clear association with optical jets , hh objects , and molecular outflows ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "fuor eruptions are often accepted as accretion events in the disk surrounding a low - mass pre  main - sequence star ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; for alternative interpretations , see herbig & petrov 1992 ; petrov 1998 ) . in this picture , the accretion rate through the disk increases by 23 orders of magnitude to @xmath4 .",
    "in addition to providing energy for the luminosity increases of fuors , this model naturally explains the broad spectral energy distributions , the variation of rotational velocity and spectral type with wavelength , and color changes during the optical decline of v1057 cyg , among other observed properties .    despite the success of the disk hypothesis , one observable characteristic of disk accreting systems ",
    "flickering  has not been observed in any known fuor . in most systems with luminous accretion disks , flickering is observed as a series of random brightness fluctuations with amplitudes of 0.011.0 mag that recur on dynamical timescales ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "often accepted as a ` signature ' of disk accretion , flickering is believed to be a dynamical variation of the energy output from the disk .",
    "thus , it provides some measure of the fluctuations in the physical structure of the disk and might someday serve as a diagnostic of physical properties within the disk ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper , we search for evidence of flickering in the historical light curve of fu ori .",
    "in addition to the outburst , we find good evidence for small - amplitude brightness fluctuations on a timescale of 1 day or less .",
    "color changes correlated with the brightness changes indicate a variable source with the optical colors of a g0 supergiant .",
    "the amplitude , color temperature , and timescale of the variations have much in common with the flickering observed in short period interacting binary systems .",
    "after ruling out several possible alternatives , we conclude that flickering is the most likely interpretation for short - term variability in fu ori .",
    "the most plausible location for the flickering source is the inner edge of the disk , where temperatures lie between the stellar temperature and the maximum disk temperature of @xmath1 7000 k.    we describe the observations in  2 , analyze the light curve in  3 , and conclude with a brief discussion and summary in  4 .",
    "we acquired ubv photometry of fu ori with the 60-cm zeiss reflector at the crimean laboratory of the sternberg state astronomical institute .",
    "the observations usually were made through a 13  aperture ; a 27  aperture was used on nights of poor seeing .",
    "these data were reduced using bd+81051 as the comparison star and other nearby stars as controls ( see @xcite ) .",
    "table 1 lists the results .",
    "the uncertainty in the calibration is @xmath20.010.02 mag for v and b  v , and @xmath20.020.04 mag for u  b .",
    "we supplement the ubv data with additional photoelectric photometry from the maidanak high altitude observatory .",
    "ibragimov ( 1997 ) describes ubvr data acquired during 19811994 as part of the rotor project .",
    "the data have been reduced to the standard ubvr system with typical errors of @xmath20.015 mag for v and v ",
    "r , @xmath20.02 mag for b ",
    "v , and @xmath20.040.08 mag for u  b .",
    "we also consider visual observations of fu ori compiled by the american association of variable star observers .",
    "the error of a typical estimate is 0.10.2 mag using standard stars in the field of fu ori calibrated from photoelectric observations .",
    "we simplify a comparison with photoelectric data by computing twenty day means of the over 7000 aavso observations . with @xmath1 15 observations per twenty day interval",
    ", this procedure reduces the typical error of a twenty day mean to @xmath1 0.03 mag , only slightly larger than the quoted error of the photoelectric data .",
    "finally , we obtained low resolution optical spectra of fu ori during 19951998 with fast , a high throughput , slit spectrograph mounted at the fred l. whipple observatory 1.5-m telescope on mount hopkins , arizona ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used a 300 g mm@xmath3 grating blazed at 4750  , a 3  slit , and recorded the spectra on a thinned loral 512 @xmath5 2688 ccd .",
    "these spectra cover 38007500   at a resolution of @xmath1 6  .",
    "on photometric nights , we acquired standard star observations to reduce the fu ori data to the hayes & latham ( 1975 ) flux scale using noao iraf .",
    "these calibrations have an accuracy of @xmath20.05 mag .",
    "this uncertainty is comparable to the probable error in spectrophotometric data acquired with the kitt peak national observatory intensified reticon spectrograph reported in kenyon ( 1988 ) .",
    "table 2 lists indices for several absorption lines using oconnell s ( 1973 ) definition , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the measured flux in a 20   bandpass centered at wavelength @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the continuum flux interpolated from continuum bandpasses on either side of the absorption feature .",

    "the system has declined by @xmath1 1 mag in nearly 70 yr .",
    "the decline in visual light has closely followed the b light curve for the past 30 yr .",
    "in addition to a long - term wave - like variation , the brightness shows considerable scatter of roughly 0.1 mag at bvr and almost 0.2 mag in u on timescales of days to months .",
    "these fluctuations are much larger than the quoted photometric errors . ibragimov ( 1997 )",
    "commented on fluctuations in brightness _ and _ color indices throughout 19811994 .",
    "similar variations are visible in light curves of v1057 cyg and v1515 cyg ( @xcite ) .",
    "we plan analyses of these other fuors in future publications .      to analyze brightness fluctuations in fu ori , we begin by separating long - term changes with timescales of years from shorter timescale variations .",
    "we consider a simple model for the outburst    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the average quiescent magnitude and @xmath12 is the time of the outburst .",
    "the brightness during outburst is a function of time , @xmath13 ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the amplitude of the outburst , @xmath16 is the e - folding time of the rise to maximum , and @xmath17 is the rate of decline from maximum .",

    ". this procedure works better than fitting all parameters at once due to the sparse nature of the light curve for @xmath23 . to estimate errors of the model parameters , we compute residuals @xmath24 of the light curve about the fit , construct new light curves by adding gaussian noise with amplitude @xmath24 to the data , and extracting new model parameters .",
    "we adopt as best the median values for model parameters from 10,000 such trials ; the quoted errors are the inter - quartile ranges of each model parameter .    table 3 summarizes results of model fits to the light curves in figure 1 .",
    "the sparse data before outburst yield a poor measure of the pre - outburst brightness and the start of the outburst .",
    "we estimate @xmath12 = jd 2428497 @xmath2 40 and @xmath25 from the b - band data ; these errors set the uncertainties in the other model parameters .",
    "the uncertainty in the decline rate at b is small ; the visual data yield a nearly identical rate of decline despite lack of data near maximum .",
    "the spectroscopic data show little evidence for any change in the mean optical spectral type during the recent 0.3 mag decline in the mean v brightness . the mg  i index , which tracks the spectral type rather well , increased by at most 0.02 mag during these years .",
    "the h@xmath26 and na  i indices , which should measure the wind of fu ori , have also remained constant .",
    "we show below that the mean colors , u ",
    "b , b  v and v ",
    "r , of fu ori have changed by @xmath27 0.02 mag in 15 years .",
    "the constant colors and spectral indices indicate that the optical spectral type has remained constant to within @xmath2 1 subclass since 1985 .",
    "the upper panel of figure 1 shows residual light curves about the best - fit model .",
    "the rms dispersion about the light curves is 0.06 mag for photoelectric data , 0.11 mag for visual data , and 0.24 mag for photographic data .",
    "all are large compared to typical uncertainties .",
    "some of the scatter in the residual light curves is due to a long - term wave with an amplitude of several tenths of a magnitude .",
    "the residual b light curve has three prominent crests at @xmath1 jd 2428500 , jd 2432000 , and jd 2436000 , with a possible small crest at @xmath1 jd 2433500 .",
    "this behavior appears to vanish in the b light curve at later times .",
    "however , the residual visual light curve then shows a similar wave - like oscillation with crests at @xmath1 jd 2439000 and jd 2442500 .",
    "another crest at @xmath1 jd 2447000 is present in the photoelectric v light curve shown in figure 2 and described below .",
    "these peaks are roughly in phase with the residual b light curve for periods of @xmath1 4000 days .",
    "there are considerable photometric variations in addition to the wave .",
    "these occur on short timescales , tens of days or less , and have amplitudes that seem uncorrelated with the overall system brightness .",
    "we will analyze these in the next section and then consider possible origins for the short - term and long - term variations .    despite the large residuals",
    ", the model fits leave negligible trends in the data .",
    "the median spearman rank correlation coefficient between the v brightness and time for the 10,000 monte carlo trials is 0.87 for the b + photographic data and 0.84 for the visual data .",
    "the median slope of a linear fit to the residual light curves is @xmath28 mag yr@xmath3 for the b + photographic data and @xmath29 mag yr@xmath3 for the visual data .",
    "we conclude that the simple model provides a reasonable fit to the long - term light curve and now consider the nature of the shorter timescale fluctuations .      to test whether or not the short timescale photometric variations in fu ori are flickering , we need to verify that ( i ) they are real changes in the brightness and color of fu ori , ( ii ) they occur on short timescales but are not periodic , and ( iii ) they can be plausibly associated with radiation from the disk .",
    "we establish the reality of the variations in two parts .",
    "we first demonstrate that the variations occur on short timescales with amplitudes larger than the photometric errors .",
    "we show later that color changes correlate with brightness changes .",
    "we consider a monte carlo model for the photoelectric data described in  2 .",
    "the lower panel of figure 2 shows v - band data acquired during the last 15 yr .",
    "both the wave - like oscillation and the large scatter about this oscillation are apparent .",
    "the solid line in this figure is the seasonal mean light curve , the average brightness for each year of observation .",
    "the top panel in the figure is the difference between the actual data and the seasonal mean .",
    "this residual light curve has a large amplitude but no linear trend or wave - like feature .",
    "our analysis indicates a small periodic component in residual light curves for b and v data .",
    "periodograms suggest a period of 17 @xmath2 1 days in the b data , which has been reported previously ( @xcite ) .",
    "this periodic component has an amplitude of 0.009 @xmath2 0.003 mag .",

    "there is no indication of the 17 day period in the v light curve .",
    "the amplitudes of these ` periodicities ' are comparable to the photometric errors but small compared to the amplitude of the fluctuations in the residual light curves ( see figures 12 ) .    to measure the amplitude of the non - periodic component in the residual light curve , we use a monte carlo model .",
    "we replace each observation v@xmath30 with a random brightness having amplitude @xmath31 and offset @xmath32 ,    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a normally distributed deviate with zero mean and unit variance ( @xcite ) . artificial light curves that provide a good match to the actual light curve",
    "should have the same amplitude and offset .",
    "we quantify a ` good match ' by comparing the magnitude distributions of actual and artificial light curves using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test .",
    "we reject poor matches with a low probability of being drawn randomly from the same distribution as the data .",
    "the ` best ' match maximizes the median k - s probability from 10,000 trials .",

    "this constraint limits the spectral type of the variable source to f7g3 .    to find a reasonable explanation for the color variations , we first consider mechanisms appropriate for single stars without circumstellar disks .",
    "although we believe an accretion disk provides the best model for observations of all fuors , it is important to consider alternatives before we identify flickering as the source of the variability in fu ori .",
    "obscuration , pulsation , and rotation are obvious choices for short period variations with small amplitudes in an isolated star .",
    "random obscuration events by small , intervening dust clouds near the central source are a popular model for rapid variations in herbig ae / be stars and other pre - main sequence stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the observed pulsational amplitude of the pre - main sequence star hr 5999 , 0.013 mag ( @xcite ) , is close to the amplitude observed in fu ori . the period of 5 hr is short compared to the spacing of our data ; a similar period in fu ori might well be missed by the analysis described above .",
    "rotational modulations with small amplitudes and periods of 12 days are observed in many pre ",
    "main - sequence stars ( @xcite and",
    "references therein ) and could plausibly produce a similar variation in fu ori .    despite its attractiveness , a stellar pulsation in fu ori seems unlikely . with an effective temperature of @xmath1 60006500 k and a luminosity of @xmath1 200  ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", fu ori lies within the classical instability strip ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the bright cepheid @xmath55 umi ( polaris ) has a comparable amplitude and other cepheids have similar periods .",
    "recent period - luminosity relations for cepheids ( @xcite ; @xcite ) yield periods of @xmath1 0.8 days for fu ori if d = 500 pc and @xmath50 = 2.2 mag .",
    "although this period is reasonably consistent with our observations , fu ori lies well above the _ pre  main - sequence _ instability strip in the hr diagram ( @xcite ) . to test the possibility that a pulsational instability might occur anyway , we constructed artificial light curves with amplitudes of 0.035 mag and periods of 0.32.0 days .",

    "our failure rate for recovering known periods in the artificial light curves is small , @xmath56 , for all periods considered , based on 10,000 artificial light curves at each of 20 periods between 0.3 and 2.0 days .",
    "the failure rate is largest for periods of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 1.5 days due to the @xmath1 1 day spacing of the light curve .",
    "the failure rate decreases to @xmath57 or less at other periods .",
    "our inability to detect any periodicity in the fu ori light curve and the lack of a theoretical instability strip for the observed luminosity and temperature of fu ori is a strong indication that pulsations do not produce the observed variation .",
    "stellar rotation is also an unlikely source of the variability .",
    "the light curve analysis for short periodicities rules out a rotational modulation of the light curve , unless the dark or bright spots responsible for the variations vary in size or intensity on timescales of several rotational periods . at the 12 day periods that seem most plausible , fu ori currently rotates close to breakup .",
    "if the star conserved angular momentum during the rise to maximum , the pre - outburst rotational velocity would have exceeded the breakup velocity by a factor of @xmath1 3 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "obscuration events similar to those envisioned in herbig ae / be stars ( see @xcite and references therein ) require special circumstances to explain the variability .",
    "reddening by small dust clouds requires unusual particles to account for a very steep reddening law , @xmath58 8 , that changes sign at v. light scattered off a reflection nebula might account for the different color variations of b  v and v ",
    "r , but it is difficult to derive as steep a color variation as is observed with simple geometries and a wide range of dust properties .",
    "photopolarimetry would test this conclusion .",
    "finally , fluctuations in the wind of fu ori are a less plausible source of brightness changes than flickering .",
    "errico ( 1997 ) have suggested that the continuum optical depth through the wind exceeds unity in the balmer and paschen continua .",
    "small variations in the optical depth due to inhomogeneities in the outflow might account for small brightness changes .",
    "if correct , this hypothesis would predict a decrease in the amplitude of the variation with decreasing wavelength , because the optical depth in the paschen continuum decreases with decreasing wavelength .",
    "for reasonable wind temperatures and densities , @xmath1 500010000 k and @xmath1 @xmath59@xmath60 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the increase in the optical depth from b to r is roughly a factor of 3 for a gas in lte .",
    "there is no evidence for this behavior in fu ori .",
    "we conclude that fluctuations associated with a stellar photosphere or wind from the disk provide a poor explanation for the rapid , small - amplitude photometric variations in fu ori . the variations in fu ori have much in common , however , with the flickering observed in other accreting systems , such as cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and low mass x - ray binary systems ( @xcite , 1994 ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in most cvs , 0.011 mag fluctuations occur on the dynamical timescale , seconds to minutes , of the inner disk . within each flicker",
    ", a cv becomes bluer as it gets brighter .",
    "the large color temperature , @xmath61 20,000 k , of the variable source also plausibly confines the flickering to the inner disk in many cvs . despite the lack of a good physical model for flickering in cvs",
    ", it clearly probes physical conditions in the inner disk .",
    "the observed variations of fu ori are also plausibly associated with the inner regions of a circumstellar accretion disk .",
    "the timescale of the variation , @xmath27 1 day , is close to the dynamical timescale of the inner disk , @xmath1 0.1 day for a 1  central star with a radius of 4 .",
    "the temperature of the variable source , @xmath1 6000 k for a g0 supergiant , is comparable to the inner disk temperature of 6500 k derived from detailed fits to the spectral energy distribution and the profiles of various absorption lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the amplitude of the variation is similar to that observed in other accreting systems . given this behavior ,",
    "we believe that the variations in fu ori _ are _ flickering and thus provide additional evidence for an accretion disk in this system .",
    "the main alternative to a variable accretion disk in fu ori is variations associated with a magnetic accretion column . despite the success of this model in other pre  main - sequence stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , truncating an accretion disk with the large accretion rate , @xmath62 , estimated in fu ori requires a large magnetic field , @xmath1 10 kg .",
    "limits on the magnetic fields of other pre  main - sequence stars are much smaller , @xmath27 23 kg ( @xcite ) .",
    "a much larger field in fu ori is unlikely .",
    "the temperature of the variable source in fu ori , @xmath1 6000 k , also seems too cool to be associated with a magnetic accretion column , where the typical temperature is @xmath63 k ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both of these arguments make a stronger case for flickering as the source of the variability in fu ori .    to see what we can learn about the inner disk from the variations , we consider several simple models for the flickering .",
    "we adopt the observed colors  u  b , b  v , and v ",
    "r  as the colors of the average state of the disk .",
    "we assume several sources of variability in a steady - state disk , ( i ) discrete changes in the mass accretion rate , @xmath64 , through the entire disk , ( ii ) random fluctuations in the flux from any annulus in the disk , and ( iii ) random fluctuations in the flux from specific annuli in the disk .",
    "we chose a steady - state disk as the average source , because steady disks provide a reasonable fit to the complete spectral energy distribution of fu ori .",
    "several experiments with non - steady disks yield similar results",
    ".    models where the entire disk can vary in brightness do not reproduce the observations .",
    "we assume a disk composed of discrete annuli with width @xmath65 at a distance @xmath66 from the central star , with @xmath67 .",
    "each annulus radiates as a star with the effective temperature assigned to the annulus .",
    "the arrows in figure 6 indicate the color variations produced by models where the flux from each annulus is a random fraction , between 1.0 and 1.1 , of the flux from the annulus of a steady - state disk .",
    "the color variation of the model clearly fails to account for the observed color variation .",
    "allowing all annuli to vary coherently also produces color variations that disagree with the observed variation .",
    "successful models allow only specific parts of the disk to vary in brightness . if disk annuli with the colors of f9g1 supergiants are the only annuli that vary , the color variation of the model follows the slope of the observed variation .    our results for flickering in fu ori are at odds with predictions of the simple steady - state accretion disk model . in steady disk models for fuors ,",
    "the disk temperature rises rapidly from zero at the stellar photosphere , @xmath68 , to @xmath69 65007000 k at @xmath70 and then decreases radially outward ( @xcite ) .",
    "the g0 temperature of the flickering source has a temperature of @xmath1 6000 k. disk material with this temperature has @xmath71 in the steady model .",
    "fluctuations in the energy output of this region , and the lack of fluctuations in hotter disk material , seem unlikely . if we associate flickering with small changes in the mass accretion rate through the disk , @xmath64 , or in the scale height of the disk , @xmath72 , we expect these to produce larger variations at smaller disk radii .",
    "recent calculations indicate that the inner regions of fuor disks may be much different than predicted by the simple disk model .",
    "the steady - state temperature distribution assumes a physically thin disk , @xmath73 ( @xcite ) .",
    "fuor disks are probably much thicker ( @xcite ; @xcite , 1990 ) .",
    "steady models that include a self - consistent treatment of the boundary layer between the inner disk and the stellar photosphere predict large scale heights , @xmath74 0.10.3 at @xmath75 ( @xcite , 1996 ) .",
    "time - dependent models further indicate that @xmath76 can vary in a complicated way close to the central star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . both types of model",
    "predict that the disk temperature peaks just outside the stellar photosphere at @xmath77 1.11.2 @xmath78 .",
    "the decline in disk temperature at smaller radii can be as large as 25%50% . applied to fu ori",
    ", these models predict that the disk temperature close to the central star is @xmath1 50006000 k , comparable to the temperature derived for the flickering source , if the peak temperature at 1.11.2 @xmath78 is @xmath1 7000 k.    we propose that the flickering source in fu ori lies between the stellar photosphere and the peak temperature in the disk at 1.11.2 @xmath78 . in the models described above , this region produces @xmath1 5% of the total optical light .",
    "observable variations in the total light from the disk  as we have reported here  thus imply significant changes in the physical structure of the inner disk .",
    "our data for fu ori require 50% variations in the light output of the inner disk .",
    "large changes in the physical structure of the disk can be avoided if the spatially thick portion of the disk occults the inner disk .",
    "if we view the disk at an inclination @xmath79 = tan@xmath80 , small variations in @xmath76 can produce small changes in brightness and color .",
    "rapid variations similar to those observed are possible if @xmath76 varies on the dynamical timescale and if the occulted portion of the disk radiates as a g0 i star .",
    "the required change in @xmath76 , @xmath1 10% , is small compared to the 50% change in light output needed above .",
    "the required geometry is , however , very special and yields no variation if the real viewing angle is much less than @xmath79",
    ". observations of v1057 cyg and v1515 cyg will test this idea , because these systems probably have smaller @xmath81 than fu ori ( @xcite ) .",
    "our results provide the first evidence for rapid photometric variations , flickering , in a fuor .",
    "the amplitude of the variation is small , @xmath1 0.035 , and just detectable with photoelectric data covering a long time interval .",
    "observations with smaller photometric uncertainties are needed to verify the detection and to place better limits on the color variations .",
    "differential photometry using a ccd on a small telescope can achieve the required precision , but the field of fu ori has few bright comparison stars within 1520 arcmin .",
    "the richness of the field may compensate and allow the high quality photometry needed to improve our results .",
    "previous attempts to find similar short - term variations in a pre  main - sequence star have met with mixed success .",
    "smith ( 1996 ) placed upper limits of 0.01 mag on short - term fluctuations in four classical t tauri stars . gullbring ( 1996 ) detected flare - like activity in the classical t tauri star bp tau , with amplitudes and timescales comparable to that observed in fu ori ; hessman & guenther ( 1997 ) noted similar behavior in three classical t tauri stars , dg tau , dr tau , and di cep .",
    "these studies all interpreted the variations with a magnetospheric disk model , where jitter in the magnetically channeled flow from the inner disk to the stellar photosphere produces small amplitude ` flares ' .",
    "we prefer to associate the variation in fu ori with flickering of the inner accretion disk .",
    "the accretion rate in fu ori , @xmath62 , is a factor of @xmath1 1000 larger than accretion rates derived for t tauri stars , which makes it difficult to truncate the disk with the modest magnetic fields , @xmath27 12 kg , detected in pre - main sequence stars .",
    "future observations can test the magnetic alternative by placing better limits on any periodic component of the photometric variation and by measuring the magnetic field strength .",
    "however these observational issues are resolved , it is clear that high precision photometry can probe the physical conditions of the inner accretion disk of a pre  main - sequence star .",
    "the amplitudes and timescales of these variations already provide some challenge to theory .",
    "the amplitude of the fu ori variation implies large fluctuations in the physical structure of the disk on short timescales .",
    "flares and other short - term variations in t tauri stars suggest smaller , but still significant , changes in disk structure close to the central star .",
    "recent hydrodynamical calculations show that the disk structure can change significantly on longer timescales , but theoretical models do not yet address rapid fluctuations in the disk similar to those observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "future calculations that consider this behavior should lead to a better understanding of mass flow in the inner disk in fuors and other types of accreting systems .",
    "we thank f. hessman for a careful and thoughtful review which improved our presentation of the data and our discussion of possible models .",
