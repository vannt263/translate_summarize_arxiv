    "the tauola package @xcite for the simulation of @xmath0-lepton decays and photos @xcite for the simulation of radiative corrections in decays , are computing projects with a rather long history . written and maintained by well - defined authors , they nonetheless migrated into a wide range of applications where they became ingredients of complicated simulation chains . as a consequence , a large number of different versions are presently in use . from the algorithmic point of view",
    ", they often differ only in a few small details , but incorporate many specific results from distinct @xmath0-lepton measurements .",
    "such versions were mainly maintained ( and will remain so ) by the experiments taking precision data on @xmath0 leptons . on the other hand , many new applications were developed recently , often requiring a program interface to other packages ( e.g. generating events for lhc , lc , belle or babar physics processes ) .",
    "the programs organization , prepared for the convenience of users , was presented during previous @xmath0 conference , in year 2004 @xcite and we will not repeat it here .",
    "this time , let us concentrate on more physics oriented results .",
    "progress in the simulation of @xmath0 decays into final states of five scalars was achieved @xcite recently .",
    "this work has some consequences for the general form how the monte carlo programs for decay chains have to be organized .",
    "we will devote section 2 to discussion of that subject . in section 3",
    "we will present some new results for the simulation of radiative corrections in decays with photos monte carlo . here",
    "papers @xcite , where next to leading order effects were introduced into generation for the first time , will be presented .",
    "even though those results do not affect simulation of @xmath0 decays in the direct way , nonetheless open the way for future precision statements on radiative effects in @xmath0 decays .",
    "that is why they should find their place in @xmath0 conference proceedings .    during my talk and in discussions",
    "later , i found significant interest in domain of overall normalization of @xmath0-lepton pair production cross sections as calculated by koralb @xcite and kkmc @xcite generators .",
    "these programs were written for higher energies .",
    "for the use at belle , babar energies some effort necessary to adjust photon vacuum polarization need to be completed .",
    "section 3 is devoted to that purpose .",
    "list of necessary benchmarks is given and necessary steps are explained .",
    "because of the limited space of the contribution , and sizable amount of other physically interesting results , some of them will be excluded from conference proceedings.in particular , this time we will skip completely the applications related to use of @xmath0 physics in domain of searches for new physics .",
    "approximations were used for five scalar decay modes in tauola until recently . in relative recent preprint @xcite , the structure for implementation of hadronic currents into @xmath0 decay modes of five scalars was prepared . for the new code ,",
    "technical tests of the solution including benchmark distribution were performed and described .",
    "finally , currents were prepared for some decay modes . for the @xmath6 mode the three decay chains @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9",
    "are introduced with simple assumptions about the couplings and propagators of the various resonances .",
    "similar amplitudes ( without the @xmath10 contributions ) are adopted for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 modes .",
    "the five - pion amplitude is thus based on a simple model , which , however , can be considered as a first realistic example . as usual ,",
    "hadronic current is easy to replace by the more sophisticated one , once it is required .",
    "also , multitude of additional decay channels of five scalars ( pions or k - ons ) are pre - installed .",
    "appropriate flavours and hadronic currents have to be provided by the user .    from that perspective , and in general from the point of view of any future monte carlo program , it is of some interest to show some of the numerical results .",
    "we will concentrate mainly on effects of the different types of interferences .",
    "[ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     table 1 : _ test results of the generator for realistic choices of parameters ; see the text of the paper @xcite for details .",
    "two currents * a * and * b * are used in different combinations .",
    "the s. ( or no s. ) comment , denotes that for the particular channel symmetrization over identical pions was ( was not ) included . with the @xmath13",
    "we denote the result difficult to interpret , because of @xmath14 see the text .",
    "_    in the numerical results , collected in table 1 the following two currents are used . *",
    "current a : * @xmath7 , * current b : * @xmath15 .",
    "if we compare lines 3 , 4 and 5 of the table , we can see that the interference between current @xmath16 and @xmath5 seems to be zero ( or very small ) on total rate .",
    "it is nice and encouraging result .",
    "this picture is different when one compare lines 1 with 3 , or 2 with 4 .",
    "there , interference which appears due to symmetrization over identical pions in final state is respectively + 5 % and -11 % . in case of current b , data from the table are not easy to interpret , because of statistical factor @xmath17 and @xmath14 .",
    "what is more , the symmetrization effect of -11 % is obscured by @xmath14 effect .",
    "let us turn now to more general discussion of our numerical results which can be compared with the experimental data of ref .",
    "perfect agreement in case of lines 3 , 4 , and 5 is a trivial consequence of the fact that these data points were used as our input for the current parameters . on the other hand , modest agreement of tauola with the data ( lines 6 and 7 ) , provide test of the predictive power of our model .",
    "rather unpredictive nature of interference effects is of importance in construction of monte carlo programs , if they are supposed to be used in comparisons with the precision data on decays .",
    "the constructive / destructive interferences originate from the corrections of order @xmath18 for intermediate resonances , which appear in the cascade decays .",
    "if widths of the resonances saturating currents would be sufficiently small then of course interferences would be negligibly small . at the same time",
    "the intermediate states would be well formed and necessities to use different parametrizations for example of @xmath19 resonance , depending on how it was formed and how it will decay , would not be necessary .    unfortunately , in practice , it is not the case , and we have to bear this constraint unpleasant for program construction in mind .",
    "there were significant changes introduced into photos monte carlo project over the last two years .",
    "the complexity of the subject matches neither size nor the purpose of the present talk .",
    "recently collected results @xcite only indirectly affect predictions of simulation for @xmath0 physics .",
    "however as for the first time explicit form of the approximate matrix elements actually used was written , new possibilities opened . in particular , for the two - body decay modes into fermions ( @xmath20 ) or scalars ( eg .",
    "@xmath21 ) exact nlo order matrix elements were implemented into photos kernel . in cases when the correction kernels were switched on and simulations were restricted to the first order , the differences with results of reference monte carlo programs were below statistical errors of @xmath22 event samples .",
    "also technical tests of photos performed at that or even better statistical level confirmed the correctness of program design ; even though significant changes in crude distributions were introduced , the results did not change at all .    to visualize the results",
    "let us present the example plots for ( @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 cases . in case of ( @xmath20 )",
    "we could perform comparisons for multi - photon version of the generation , because our reference program kkmc has such possibility as well .",
    "the histogram with the worst agreement of all possible invariant masses which could be constructed from four momenta of : @xmath23 and eventually up to two hardest photons ( their energies had to be above 1 gev ) is shown in fig 1 where the invariant mass of @xmath24 pair is plotted . even in this case , the green and red ( gray ) lines for photos and kkmc nearly overlap ( the logarithmic left side scale has to be used for that lines ) . to visualize the differences , we show on the plot the ratio of the two histograms which is depicted with the black line and follows linear right scale .",
    "the differences in the ratio are rather small for the masses of @xmath24 pair up to about 50 gev . for larger masses which contribute about @xmath25 to the sample of two - photon configurations",
    "the difference gradually grow to about 15% close to the phase space limit .",
    "note that fraction of events with least two photons each of which with energies above 1 gev is 1.26 % from kkmc and 1.29 % from photos .    in case of the @xmath5 meson decays the agreement between photos and reference calculation , even without the use of correcting weight was excellent , that is better than for the presented above result for @xmath4 decay .",
    "that is why we skip numerical result and address the reader to conference transparencies or to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "( 35,80 ) ( -65,-45)(0,0)[lb ]    1.5 cm",
    "in discussions it became obvious that some comments on the overall normalization of koralb and kkmc predictions for @xmath0-lepton pair production at belle and babar energies is of importance for the present day users .    one has to bear in mind that koralb was published @xcite more than _ twenty years ago_. the program was supposed to feature orthodox first order qed corrections and complete mass and spin effects .",
    "such formula turned out to be very useful , and program remains in broad use until now . on the other hand ,",
    "some of its inputs are rather outdated and do not match the present day requirements , even for technical tests . to be precise , i have in mind the function piret(s ) , which features the real part of hadronic vacuum polarization of photon as measured by the data collected until early 80 s .",
    "obviously this function need to be replaced by the more modern one",
    ". a possible choice can be the function repi of ref .",
    "@xcite because it t has similar functionality as piret of koralb .",
    "unfortunately the improvements on fortran function piret(s ) describing hadronic vacuum polarization of photon , do not solve all normalization problems of koralb .",
    "it is well known since long , that the genuine one loop corrections are not enough , and the solutions are available .",
    "the two major improvements which appeared as a consequence of phenomenology improvements during the lep era was introduction of higher order qed corrections into monte carlo simulations and better way to combine loop corrections with the rest of the field theory calculations .",
    "it was found to be safe to sum contributions of loop corrections into photon ( and @xmath4 ) propagators .",
    "then , terms of all , but incomplete , orders of perturbation expansion are taken into account .",
    "that is why significant effort was needed to justify the approach @xcite . at lower energies things",
    "are of course simpler , as there is no need to worry about @xmath4-lineshape .",
    "the kkmc monte carlo @xcite could thus be a complete solution to b - factory needs and ready to use .",
    "this program features higher order qed matrix elements with the help of exclusive exponentiation , and explicit matrix element up to the second order .",
    "unfortunately electroweak library ( which include vacuum polarization , the only function interesting for low energy applications ) was never adopted to requirements of processes below 13 gev center - of - mass energies .    to provide reasonably good results , this library needs thus to be overruled ( analogously to the function piret(s ) of koralb ) by a more suitable one .",
    "after small tests the function repi of ref .",
    "@xcite should be suitable ( overall normalization constants and other details of conventions need to be checked ) .",
    "once this is completed , and if two - loop photon vacuum polarization can be neglected , koralb and kkmc can form a base for tests and studies of systematic errors for cross section normalizations at low energies .",
    "the necessary strategy should be similar to the one for the bhabha scattering see eg .",
    "@xcite for description .    for that purpose",
    "the following calculations of the total cross section should be performed :    1 .",
    "koralb radiative corrections switched off .",
    "kkmc , both electroweak corrections and initial state qed bremsstrahlung switched off ( final state bremsstrahlung need to be kept on , otherwise spin amplitudes necessary for calculation of @xmath0 spin correlations are not calculated and program stops ) .",
    "radiative corrections switched on in koralb .",
    "radiative corrections switched on in koralb .",
    "vacuum polarization switched off with the help of internal key ifvac=0 .",
    "kkmc : electroweak corrections on , initial state qed bremsstrahlung switched off . 6 .",
    "kkmc : electroweak corrections switched off but initial state qed bremsstrahlung switched on 7 .",
    "kkmc : both electroweak corrections and initial state qed bremsstrahlung switched on    the results , we will call them respectively @xmath26 , can be calculated for @xmath0- or @xmath27-pair production .",
    "also experimental cuts can be applied in the calculation of these cross section .",
    "let us list now some of the possible checks . of course all calculations being compared",
    "must be performed with the same assumptions on experimental cuts and final state flavours .",
    "@xmath13 : @xmath28 should be larger by a factor of @xmath29 than @xmath30 for all center of mass energies in case no experimental cuts are applied .",
    "@xmath13 : the following relation times born cross section . in case of kkmc the vacuum polarization factor @xmath31 appears for all events . in case",
    "when initial state bremsstrahlung is switched on , the effective transfer @xmath32 depends on the amount of energy carried out by the initial state radiation convolution with initial state radiation spectrum is formed .",
    "] should hold : @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath13 : finally comparisons of @xmath34 @xmath35 with @xmath30 can be used to estimate the size of qed bremsstrahlung effects respectively of higher orders or just first order alone .",
    "@xmath13 : the relation @xmath36 is not expected to hold precisely . it can hint on numerical importance of convoluting qed bremsstrahlung and vacuum polarization with respect to naive factorization .",
    "if comparisons are repeated with experimental cuts applied , some extra care must be taken , because of cut off dependence of final state bremsstrahlung effects . on the other hand , numerically significant and theoretically ambiguous contributions from events with very low final state lepton pair invariant masses , are removed .",
    "unfortunately the above points must remain in sketchy form .",
    "full clarification , as lep experience showed , require significant amount of work .",
    "the status of the computer programs for the decay of @xmath0 leptons and associated projects was reviewed .",
    "the high - precision version of photos for radiative corrections was presented . in particular ,",
    "the option to run the program with multiple - photon radiation was mentioned .",
    "new results for leptonic decays of @xmath4 , and @xmath5 meson decays into pair of scalars , were presented . for these channels complete next - to - leading order effects can now be simulated . however , for the most of the applications these effects are not necessary , leaving standard modular version of photos sufficient .",
    "the important result of the above work , is that the path to include electromagnetic form - factors of the particles participating in decay is now open for the future fits to the data",
    ". these form - factor effects may be significantly larger and physically more justified , than complete next - to - leading order effects of scalar qed in @xmath5 meson decays recently installed , ,    the presentation of the tauola general - purpose interface was omitted because of lack of time .",
    "examples for its use in the case of the higgs boson parity measurement at a future linear collider @xcite and for higgs searches at the lhc @xcite can be found in the literature .",
    "recently , a similar application was developed for the case of studies in hypothetical effects of cp - parity breaking in the @xmath37-@xmath38 system at belle and babar @xcite .",
    "distinct versions of the tauola library for @xmath0 lepton decay , and of photos for radiative corrections in decays , are now in use .",
    "the principles how to use the distribution package , are presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the talk",
    "we have reviewed the results for the novel decay modes of tauola into five scalars .",
    "these modes feature now the hadronic current .",
    "the simple but realistic current @xcite is available for decay modes @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "numerical study of the new decay modes helped to formulate comments on the importance of @xmath39 terms for the intermediate resonances .",
    "it is argued that the constructive or destructive interferences appear and that their existence must be taken into account by builders of the future monte carlo programs for decays ( not necessarily @xmath0 decays ) .",
    "finally , presentation of adjustments for koralb and kkmc programs in treatment of photonic vacuum polarization was given .",
    "it was explained , that without such changes the programs can not be used for discussion of the normalization uncertainty for the @xmath0-lepton pair production cross section at belle / babar energies .",
