    "the manner in which protoplanetary disks evolve and , potentially , form planets is one of the most exciting subjects of research in astrophysics in the last decade . through multi - wavelength observations , combined with a growing number of models and theories ,",
    "many complex processes have been found to play a role in explaining how planets could possibly form from the small dust and gas initially present in those disks .",
    "it is not yet clear exactly under which circumstances the different processes are determinant .",
    "however , it is clear that the study of protoplanetary disks alone is unlikely to lead to a full picture of disk evolution .    a powerful way to learn more about disks is to study young stars that no longer are surrounded by them .",
    "it is believed that all stars are born harboring circumstellar disks , through conservation of angular momentum during the star formation process .",
    "observations have shown that not all disks have the same lifetime , but that they vary between approximately 1 and 10 myr , with about 50% of dusty disks disappearing within 3 myr ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". differences between young stars of the same age with and without disks could yield a greater understanding of the processes that affect disk evolution , and eventually allow time for planets to form .",
    "the difficulty in studying young stars without disks lies in identifying them .",
    "young stars are most commonly found on the basis of their colors , which takes into account the presence of the dusty disk emission , prominent in the infra - red ( ir ) region of the system ( star+disk ) spectrum .",
    "if a young star is no longer surrounded by a disk , its optical - ir colors are indistinguishable from fore-/background stars observed in the same direction as the star - forming region to which it belongs . with broad - band optical / ir photometric studies , it can be difficult to identify candidate diskless young stars .",
    "the picture changes considerably when studying a region at x - ray wavelengths . in this short - wavelength regime ,",
    "young stars are very active whether or not a disk is still present ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , x - ray emission has been often used to identify young stellar objects in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "confirmation of their young stellar nature , however , is necessary through other means , the most powerful of which being optical spectroscopy ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the serpens molecular cloud is a young star - forming region ( @xmath02 myr , @xcite ) .",
    "vlbi measurements by @xcite of ec95 in the serpens core indicate it at a distance of 415 pc . given the size of the cloud , it is reasonable to assume a distance of 415 @xmath1 15 pc for its entirety . the young stellar population still surrounded by disks in serpens beyond its core has been uncovered in the infrared by the",
    "_ spitzer space telescope _",
    "legacy program ` c2d ' @xcite . unlike the serpens core , which has been well studied in a variety of wavelengths ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", nothing was known about the diskless young stellar population of serpens beyond its core until it was observed with _",
    "xmm - newton _",
    "( brown et al . , in prep ) .",
    "two _ xmm - newton _ pointings cover about @xmath2 of the serpens area observed by the c2d , and dozens of objects were identified by brown et al . as young diskless star candidates , for",
    "which confirmation is still necessary .    in this paper",
    "we report on an optical multi - object spectroscopic survey designed to confirm the youth and membership of those newly - discovered young diskless star candidates discovered in serpens with _ xmm - newton_. section [ sdata ] describes the vlt / flames observations and data reduction .",
    "the data are analysed in section [ sanalysis ] , where spectral types , stellar temperatures and luminosities are determined .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) are constructed with the addition of optical , near- and mid - ir photometry from the literature .",
    "then , the objects are placed in a hr diagram overlaid with pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks , from which individual ages and masses are derived . in section [ sdis ] , the bona - fide diskless young stellar population of serpens is discussed and contextualized with respect to the disk - bearing population @xcite . finally , we present our conclusions in section [ scon ] .",
    "the spectroscopic data were obtained using the fibre large array multi - element spectrograph ( flames ) on the 8.2 m ut2 ( kueyen ) telescope of eso , in paranal , chile , in service mode in june , 2009 .",
    "flames consists of three components : a fibre positioner ( ozpoz ) , a medium - high resolution optical spectrograph giraffe , and a link to the instrument uves .",
    "the data used in this work consist of two observing blocks from flames / giraffe using the medusa fibers .",
    "this setting allows for up to 132 fibers of @xmath3 aperture in the @xmath4 diameter field of view of the instrument .",
    "the wavelength range chosen , 64377183  , offers a spectral resolution of 0.8  and covers temperature - sensitive features that allow spectral classification .",
    "the two observed fields ( ao5 and ao6 ) were centered on the _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "an input list of the young stellar candidates coordinates was provided based on x - ray detections from brown et al .",
    "( in prep . ) .",
    "ao5 , observed by _ xmm - newton _ on 2007 - 04 - 15 in program 0402820101 , was centered at 277.254625 + 0.49727778 , and ao6 , observed 2008 - 04 - 16 in xmm program 0503240201 , was centered at 277.34775 + 0.8228333 .",
    "_ xmm - newton _ has a slightly larger aperture than flames at 30 versus 25 so candidates on the edges of the xmm fields could not be observed .",
    "all x - ray sources , regardless of optical or infrared characteristics were considered for follow - up .",
    "preference was given to targets with optical counterparts which are not part of the _ spitzer _ disk sample in the same region @xcite and had no previously known spectral information .",
    "fiber placement was optimized using the fposs fibre configuration program of flames , which permitted observation of most candidates .",
    "however , some candidates could not be simultaneously observed and had to be dropped .",
    "unused fibers were placed on ` blank ' positions of the sky for sky subtraction . to maximize dynamic range ,",

    "the pipeline performs frame correction for detector defects , fiber localization and tracing , flat - fielding and fiber transmission , correction of scattered light and wavelength calibration .",
    "the science spectra were extracted within idl after wavelength calibration . for each observed field , all sky spectra were combined with a @xmath5 clipping in order to exclude cosmic rays or any other artifacts .",
    "this combined sky spectrum was then subtracted from the science spectra to remove sky lines . since each field",

    "it is worth noting that the spectra of objects 02 - 005 and 02 - 025 do not show li i , while the line is seen in the spectra of 02 - 008 and 02 - 039 . at this point",
    "it is difficult to confirm membership and these four objects are left out of the further discussion .",
    "the remaining 19 objects are confirmed new members of serpens .",
    "it can be seen from figures [ fsed1 ] and [ fsed2 ] that 6 out of 19 new confirmed members of serpens ( 03 - 005 , 02 - 007 , 02 - 028 , 02 - 037 , 02 - 057 and 02 - 072 ) show some ir - excess .",
    "objects 02 - 007 and 02 - 028 show excess emission throughout the _ spitzer _ bands .",
    "this is considered weak ir - excess for being lower than the median excess for objects in taurus @xcite , the prototype for full disks .",
    "the other four objects have seds indicative of cold or transitional disks , where no excess is seen in the near- to mid - ir , and a more substantial excess is present at mid- to far - ir .",
    "object 03 - 005 was indeed previously confirmed as a cold disk with _",
    "irs spectra @xcite .",
    "objects 02 - 037 , 02 - 057 and 02 - 072 are new cold disk candidates .",
    "none of the four older objects , not yet confirmed to be members of the cloud , show any ir excess .",
    "following @xcite , we identify h@xmath7 emission in table [ t_spt ] as strong ( full width at @xmath16 of peak intensity higher than 270 km s@xmath17 ) or weak ( h@xmath7 10% < 270 km s@xmath17 ) .",
    "in addition , in table [ t_spt ] ` a ' indicates that h@xmath7 is seen in absorption .",
    "three out of the 19 new members show strong emission of the h@xmath7 line .",
    "these objects ( 03 - 005 , 02 - 037 and 02 - 072 ) also show ir excess , indicating that disks are still present .",
    "none of the confirmed diskless sources show strong h@xmath7 emission , albeit some do show weak h@xmath7 emission , which can be attributed to chromospheric activity @xcite .    this way ,",
    "86 stars were observed by flames but only 25 objects are bright enough for spectral classification . out of these 25 objects analyzed , 19 are confirmed new members of serpens , while the other 6 could not be confirmed or rejected at this point . out of the new confirmed members of the cloud",
    ", 2/3 are show to be diskless , while the other 1/3 show ir - excess weaker than the median of taurus .",
    "the most straightforward explanation for why the disks around these newly confirmed young stars have already dissipated would be that these stars are systematically a few myr older than the stars with disks in the same area of serpens @xcite .",
    "the higher ages would be sufficient for their disks to have evolved and dissipated",
    ". this could be the case for the older objects 02 - 005 , 02 - 008 , 02 - 025 and 02 - 039 , if these objects indeed belong to the cloud .",
    "another possibility would be that these diskless stars are consistently more massive than the disk - bearing stars in the same area of serpens of the same age .",
    "it has been shown that disk lifetimes are related to the host star mass , with higher mass stars having disks that dissipated faster @xcite .",
    "figure [ hist ] shows the mass and age distributions for our sample of newly - confirmed members of serpens ( solid red lines ) , and those for the disk - bearing young stars in the same region ( dot - dashed black lines ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is immediately clear that , although not perfect copies of each other ( ks statistical tests show that the hypothesis that they are drawn from different distributions is not supported , with probabilities p = @xmath18 and @xmath16 for the distributions of ages and masses , respectively ) , the distributions of both stellar ages and masses of diskless young stars have the same spread , and even the same peak locations , as those of disk - bearing stars in the same region . once again it is important to note that only the confirmed new members are taken into consideration here . if the 4 older stars ( section [ shrd ] ) are indeed members of the cloud , the statistical significance would change for the age distribution ( p=@xmath19 and @xmath20 for the distributions of ages and masses , respectively ) .",
    "however , it is true that the bulk of this new population is not consistently shifted towards larger ages .",
    "although we acknowledge that the sample studied here does not necessarily represent the entire population of diskless young stars in serpens , the similarity of the distributions suggest that ages and stellar masses are not absolute drivers of disk evolution .",
    "other parameters must play an important role , such that stars of similar age and mass end up having such different disks ( or lack thereof ) .",
    "that is not to say that either parameter is not important for disk evolution : the big picture remains that disks evolve with time and , statistically , older stars have more evolved ( or no ) disks compared to young stars .",
    "however , a complete theory of protoplanetary disk evolution must take into account that stars of similar age and in the same environment do present an large variety in disk structures ( e.g @xcite ) or no disks at all .",
    "similar results were seen by @xcite . from a reliable x - ray sample from the rosat satellite ,",
    "stars were characterized spectroscopically and placed in hr diagrams .",
    "they report the in the chamaeleon i and taurus - auriga star - forming regions , no significant differences are seen in the age distributions of disk - bearing ( class ii ) and diskless ( class iii ) stars . in that work ,",
    "the authors discuss two immediate consequences of these results : ( i ) an underestimate of cloud star formation rates for samples dominated by class ii stars ; and ( ii ) that the high numbers of class iii stars in young regions imply that many ( at least 1/2 of low - mass stars in chamaeleon i ) lose their disks within 1 myr . in that work",
    ", the authors already argued that there is no preferred disk lifetime , since disk - bearing and diskless stars coexist along the hayashi track .",
    "more recently , aided by _",
    "observations and optical spectroscopy , @xcite showed very similar age distributions for class ii and class iii stars in the serpens core and ngc1333 .",
    "they argued that young stellar populations with and without disks show indistinguishable spatial and age distributions , suggesting that class iii stars are not typically older stars , but rather stars that lost their disks quicker .",
    "in addition , @xcite and @xcite have studied the differences between classical t tauri stars ( ctts , young stars actively accreting material from their disks ) and weak - line t tauri stars ( wtts , young stars that show no signs of accretion ) .",
    "correspondingly , both studies find no significant difference in the age distributions of ctts and wtts .",
    "however , it is important to note that not all wtts are bona - fide class iii objects .",
    "many wtts have disks ( even thick disks ) but that for some reason are no longer accreting material onto their host stars .",
    "therefore , what these results show is that there is no significant difference in the age distribution of stars that are actively accreting from their disks and stars that are not .",
    "several different processes actively being studied could possibly be responsible for the fast dissipation of some disks , while others last many myr .",
    "for instance , a relationship between the disk mass ( from 1.3 mm observations with the submillimeter array ) and stellar mass has been shown to be real for a complete disk sample in taurus by @xcite .",
    "if confirmed for other complete and unbiased samples , this result puts strong constraints on theories for disk evolution and planet formation",
    ". the stellar mass would be decisive on how much material is available in disks for planets to form from .",
    "another interesting process that could be decisive on disk evolution timescales is photoevaporation .",
    "theoretical calculations predict that energetic uv and x - ray photons emitted by the central star could heat the surface of the disk and cause pressure - driven hydrodynamic mass outflows from the disk @xcite .",
    "coupled with the disk viscous evolution , disks could be dispersed in @xmath21 myr .",
    "observational confirmation of photoevaporation is an active field that has already produced some interesting results ( e.g. @xcite ) .    just as exciting , and perhaps even more observationally challenging , is the effect of multiplicity on disk evolution .",
    "since the majority of low - mass stars form in multiple systems , binary companions can affect disk evolution directly .",
    "@xcite showed these effects for the first time on a complete sample in taurus - auriga .",
    "they found that tidal influence of a close binary ( @xmath22 40 au ) accelerates significantly disk dispersal , with disks being completely dissipated within 1 myr for @xmath02/3 of close binaries .",
    "the same is true for only a small fraction of wide binaries and single stars ( @xmath23 ) whose disks are dispersed within 23 myr .",
    "these exciting results must be confirmed with similar observations of complete samples of young stars in different star - forming regions , of different mean ages and environments .",
    "we have confirmed , for the first time , a significant population of young diskless stars discovered at x - ray wavelengths that are members of the serpens molecular cloud .",
    "stellar ages and masses for 23 stars were derived based on a comparison with pms evolutionary tracks .",
    "19 young stars are confirmed to be members of serpens , while the remaining four could not be conclusively shown to have ages consistent with cluster membership .",
    "six of these 19 confirmed stars show weak ir excess ( below the taurus median ) , while the other 13 are truly diskless sources .      this similarity may hold significant implications for the picture of disk evolution in which the main factors that determine disk fraction are mass and age . if confirmed for the larger sample of young diskless star candidates ,",
    "our results indicate that other , yet poorly understood observationally , characteristics may play an important role as well .",
    "this work is based on observations made with eso telescopes at paranal observatories under program i d 083.c-0766(b ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for her / his suggestions , that greatly improved this manuscript .",
