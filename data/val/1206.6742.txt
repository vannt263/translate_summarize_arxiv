    "massive stars produce some of nature s most energetic phenomena as they end their lives in spectacular supernova or @xmath0-ray burst explosions @xcite . while the post - main - sequence evolutionary path of a single massive star is still not settled ( e.g. , the sequence through red / blue supergiant , wolf - rayet , luminous blue variable phases for stars of various masses ; @xcite ) , the possible evolutionary paths of close massive binary systems are even less certain .",
    "nevertheless , close massive binaries appear common @xcite , and secondary stars in such systems have been implicated in removing hydrogen envelopes from massive primaries prior to core collapse , resulting in a substantial fraction ( 3040% ) of type ib / c supernovae and @xmath0-ray bursts @xcite .",
    "close massive binaries may also produce the observed population of high - velocity `` runaway '' stars either through ejection of one component after the supernova explosion or during multi - body gravitational interactions @xcite .    papers i  iv in this series ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) describe prior results of the cygnus  ob2 radial velocity survey intended to measure the massive binary characteristics ( i.e. , binary fraction , distribution of periods , mass ratios , eccentricities ) for a large number ( 114 ) massive stars in a single cluster / association having a common formation environment . in particular , paper iv ( table  6 ) summarizes orbital elements for the 20 massive binaries with measured parameters .",
    "paper v @xcite uses these previously published data and the new data presented herein ( a total of 25 measured systems ) to infer the intrinsic distributions of massive binaries , concluding that the fraction of massive stars ( defined as b3 and earlier ; i.e. , supernova progenitors ) having companions may be as high as 90% , and that 45% of these are likely to interact at some point .",
    "paper v reports an excess of short - period 47 day systems relative to 714 day systems and finds that the distribution of mass ratios is approximately flat over the range 0.1@xmath41.0 . besides providing the fundamental data for modeling the frequencies of energetic phenomena , these types of statistics help place constraints on theoretical frameworks for the formation of massive stars which remain under debate @xcite .    in this sixth paper of the series we present orbital solutions for five additional massive spectroscopic binaries in cyg  ob2one double - lined ( sb2 ) and four single - lined ( sb1 ) systems  using spectroscopic data obtained primarily during 20102011 , but utilizing some data as early as 1999 . using the nomenclature of @xcite , these systems are mt103 ( sb2 ) , mt070 , mt174 , mt267 , and mt734 ( sb1s ) .",

    "an 1800  l  mm@xmath10 grating in first order yielded a spectral resolution of 1.5    near 5800    with a 2@xmath11100  slit .",
    "the spectral coverage was 52506750   .",
    "exposure times ranged from 1200 s to 3600 s in multiples of 600 s depending on target brightness , current seeing ( 1.23 arcseconds fwhm ) and cloud conditions .",
    "reductions followed standard longslit techniques , including flat fielding from dome quartz lamp exposures .",
    "copper - argon arc lamp exposures were taken after each star exposure to wavelength calibrate the spectra to an rms of 0.03    ( 1.5  at 5800   ) .",
    "multiple exposures were combined yielding final s / n ratios typically in excess of 100:1 near 5800   .",
    "final spectra were doppler corrected to the heliocentric frame . each spectrum",
    "was then shifted by a small additional amount in velocity so that the na  i  d @xmath125890,5996 lines were registered with the mean na i line wavelength across the ensemble of observations .",
    "this zero - point correction to each observation is needed to account for effects of image wander in the dispersion direction when the stellar fwhm of the point spread function was appreciably less than the slit width . because of these inevitable slit - placement effects on the resulting wavelength solutions at the level of @xmath1310 , radial velocity standards were not routinely taken .",
    "relative velocity shifts were generally less than 7  .    in 2010",
    "the wiro - longslit data were obtained with the 600 l mm@xmath10 grating in second order covering 40005900    at 2.8    fwhm resolution near 5800   .",
    "reductions followed the same procedures previously described .",
    "the lower spectral resolution of these data limited their utility and are seldom used , but we note them here for completeness .",
    "we measured the radial velocity for each spectrum obtained at wiro using gaussian fits to the @xmath145876 line .",

    "stars with strong winds , including very early o stars ( not present in this particular subsample ) and evolved stars ( mt267 , mt734 ) may exhibit he line centers that are blue shifted with respect to this assumed rest wavelength .",
    "our fitting code fixes the gaussian width and depth to be the mean determined from all the spectra , after rejecting outliers , and it solves for the best fitting line center . in the case of an sb2 like mt103 , the code fits a double gaussian where the widths and depths have been fixed independently using observations obtained near quadrature . in the case of the long - period system mt070 ( 6.2 years )",
    "we included data from the wiyn telescope & hydra fiber spectrograph covering the range 38004500   .",
    "therefore , we measured radial velocities by fits to the @xmath144471 line instead of @xmath145876 .",
    "our analysis of keck spectra of stars having minimal radial velocity variations suggest no systematic differences between these two lines .",
    "however , the velocities from the wiyn / hydra appear systematically 515  more negative than velocities from wiro for constant - velocity systems having sufficient data from both observatories to make this comparison .",
    "observations of radial velocity standard stars using wiyn / hydra showed excellent agreement with published velocities ( paper i ) . given the spectral stability of the fiber - fed hydra bench - mounted spectrograph , we consider velocities from this instrument to be more reliable .",
    "accordingly , when wiro and wiyn spectra are combined to compute solutions for the same star ( mt070 ) , we shift the wiro velocities by @xmath1510 .",
    "we caution that this may introduce systematic shifts in the systemic velocity reported . however , the primary goal of the cygnus  ob2 radial velocity survey is to obtain orbital parameters for massive binaries , a goal that requires good _ relative _ radial velocities .",
    "absolute space velocities from which systemic velocities may be inferred are of lesser importance .",
    "tables  [ 103.tab ] and [ rest.tab ] report the adopted radial velocities and uncertainties for each star , along with the orbital phase , @xmath16 , from the best - fitting solution , and the observed minus computed ( o@xmath15c ) residuals .",

    "we analyzed the cleaned @xcite power spectrum for each object to select likely periods and then examined the folded velocity curve for periods corresponding to the strongest peaks in the power spectrum .",
    "in most cases the strongest peaks yielded clean , convincing phased velocity curves .",
    "secondary peaks and possible aliases could be eliminated by visual inspection owing to the much larger dispersion in the data at any given phase .",
    "we used the binary orbital solution package `` binary '' by d. gudehus with these initial period estimates and the radial velocity data to solve for the full suite of orbital parameters and associated uncertainties .",

    "figure  [ color ] show that mt070 lies along the eastern edge of the association ( upper right ) in an apparently unremarkable region mostly devoid of h@xmath7 and pah emission . however , there are filaments of 8 @xmath6 m & 24 @xmath6 m emission and  ( c. brunt , private communication ) at cyg  ob2 radial velocities cutting across this region , suggesting the likelihood of elevated dust extinction that could explain the redder color of mt070 relative to the other cyg  ob2 members .",

    "we therefore adopt the spectral type of o9iii for the primary of mt070 .",

    "our time - series analysis of the mt070 spectra shows a peak in the power spectrum near 6 years , along with several secondary peaks at similarly long periods between 58 years .",
    "however , the best - fitting orbital solutions invariably converged to a period of 6.19@xmath330.13 years , which yielded @xmath34=0.68 , considerably smaller than other candidate periods .",

    "the absence of @xmath144070 , @xmath144348 , @xmath144416 and @xmath143995 , which we acknowledge may be lost in the noise of the spectral continua , indicates that the primary is not evolved , and lies in the range b12v .",

    "the most deblended spectra indicate that the secondary component s he lines are similar to the primary s , but slightly weaker . given this and that the calculated mass ratio for this system is 0.71 , we adopt b2 as the likely spectral type for the secondary .",

    "i @xcite then the implied secondary mass ranges between 3.0  for an inclination of @xmath70  and 30  for @xmath71  if the secondary approaches the mass of the primary .",
    "given the evolved , luminous nature of the primary , which we assume dominates the luminosity of the system , is it conceivable that the secondary may be as massive as the primary but not visible in the integrated spectrum .",
    "the lack of known eclipses @xcite provides only a weak constraint that the inclination is smaller than 81 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the mass ratio of the system is @xmath72 with semi major axis @xmath73 au .",
    "the presence of x - rays and x - ray variability in mt267 @xcite is consistent with a wind - wind collision in a close , interacting binary .",
    "if the wind collision scenario is correct for the origin of the x - rays , then the secondary component is probably toward the massive end of our allowed range , implying @xmath74  in order to make the mass of the secondary equivalent to a b0v or earlier .",

    "if this bok globule / molecular cloud lies in the foreground to mt267 ( and cyg  ob2#12 ) , it is conceivably responsible for the higher extinction recorded to these objects .",
    "however , the very large extinction of cyg  ob2#12 ( @xmath8912 mag ) can not be solely attributed to this cloud .",
    "given the large radial velocity difference between this cloud and cyg  ob2 , it is probable that this cloud lies substantially in the foreground .",
    "the lack of pah emission around the borders of this cloud further supports the conjecture that it lies at some distance from the massive ionizing stars .",
    "mt734 ( vi  cyg  # 11/schulte  11 ) is a well - known emission - line star of type o5i(f ) , as classified by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ color ] illustrates that mt734 lies along the western boundary of the association in an area apparently devoid of h@xmath7 and pah emission , although it is surrounded by molecular clouds .",
    "our 39 spectra , taken with the wiro longlit spectrograph over the period 20072011 , show that this system is a single - lined spectroscopic binary .",

    "we have not applied any systematic velocity corrections to the wiro data .",
    "the comparatively blue - shifted line centers may be a result of line formation in the upper atmosphere / outflowing wind in this very luminous supergiant .",
    "if we adopt a mass of 51  appropriate to an o5i ( @xmath90 ) from @xcite , then an inclination of 90yields a secondary mass of @xmath917.7 , @xmath24=0.15 , and @xmath26=1.31 au .",
    "assuming @xmath25=13  implies that the seondary mass approaches that of the primary , @xmath92  1 and @xmath26=1.51 au .",
    "the lack of known eclipses does not place helpful constraints on the inclination .",
    "mt734 is listed as a 1400 mhz radio continuum source with @xmath93=0.5@xmath330.3 mjy @xcite .",
    "this could result from the coliding winds of two massive stars .",
    "figure  [ 734sequence ] shows the spectral time sequence for mt734 , ordered by phase , in the spectral region around @xmath145876 ( left panel ) and h@xmath7 ( right panel ) .",
    "the line shows a smooth progression of central wavelength with orbital phase , while the h@xmath7 line is broad , exhibits emission , and has irregular line profiles , typical of supergiants .",
    "we have presented orbital solutions for five additional massive binaries that are probable members of the cygnus  ob2 association , bringing the total number of multiple systems therein to 25 .",
    "the vast majority of these have complete orbital solutions , making this the largest collection of massive binary statistics in any single cluster or association to date .",
    "@xcite have used these data , along with previously known systems documented in papers i  iv , to infer the underlying distribution of periods , mass ratios , and eccentricities for cyg  ob2 as a whole .",
    "the analysis of @xcite suggests that the known list of 25 binaries out of 114 cyg  ob2 systems surveyed is reasonably complete at periods less than about 30  days , but that we should expect to discover an additional 1015 binaries having longer periods as the cygnus  ob2 radial velocity survey continues .",
    "noteworthy among the new list of massive binaries is the discovery of a probable progenitor of a low - mass x - ray binary system ( mt174 ) . also noteworthy",
    "is the long - period system mt070 with a period of 6.2 years .",
    "both of these low - amplitude systems ( @xmath20@xmath329 ) attest to the capabilities of the survey to achieve orbital solutions for either low - inclination or low-@xmath24 systems .",
