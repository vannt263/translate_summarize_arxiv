    "the bulk properties of a vortex lattice ( vl ) of a type ii superconductor are studied experimentally , among other techniques , by magnetization , small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) , muon spin rotation ( @xmath1sr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements . to extract physical information on the investigated compound modeling of the vl magnetic properties",
    "is required .",
    "this is usually done using either the london or the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) models.@xcite while the london model neglects the vortex cores altogether  which is acceptable for low fields only  the gl model accounts for them .",
    "although the gl theory is strictly valid only near the superconducting critical temperature at low field it turned out to be a good approximation for a number of classical bcs superconductors.@xcite the gl model is usually found to provide a proper description of the vl thoughout the mixed phase for unconventional superconductors also , assuming the london penetration depth and the ginzburg - landau coherence length to be effective parameters.@xcite this is further discussed by landau and keller.@xcite    one of the interesting phenomena predicted yet in 1972 by delrieu is the diffraction of the cooper s pairs on the periodic potential induced by the vl.@xcite he showed that for clean superconductors at low temperatures and fields close to the upper critical field @xmath0 exotic behaviours of the vl may be observed due to the cooper s pair diffraction . the spatial field distribution around vortex cores obtains a conical shapes and the positions of the minimal and saddle point fields interexchange . as a consequence the probability field distribution shows a linear tail around the vortex core field . nearly at the same time",
    "e. h. brandt came to the same conclusion based on a nonlocal theory of superconductivity.@xcite in the following publications he presented analytical and numerical results for the nonlocal vl behaviour at fields close to @xmath0 with an arbitrary impurity scattering,@xcite and later for a broad range of fields.@xcite later on , an exact numerical solution of the eilenberger s quasiclassical equations by u. klein allowed one to determine the microscopic structure of the order parameter and magnetic field in the whole range of the applied fields.@xcite    writing a simplified gorkovs@xcite integral equation for the green s function in terms of a set of linear algebraic equations for the time and space fourier components , u.  brandt _ et al .",
    "_ have been able to compute analytically the density of states under high fields.@xcite later on the magnetization@xcite as well as the field distribution@xcite were also obtained by u.  brandt _ et al . _ and delrieu , respectively , using the previously derived results for the green s function .",
    "the clean and dirty limits were considered by delrieu in his phd thesis.@xcite    it is worth to note that the cooper s pair diffraction is a property of clean superconductors .",
    "therefore , in most of high temperature superconductors these diffraction effects may be observable .",
    "a vl field distribution which may exhibit a high - field linear tail was reported from nmr measurement on vanadium.@xcite later on the existence of the tail was confirmed by herlach _",
    "et al . _ for niobium using @xmath1sr measurements.@xcite they were performed at low temperature and for an external field @xmath2 relatively close to @xmath0 .",
    "the linear tail is qualitatively different from gl model expectation for which a field cutoff should be present.@xcite    the nmr and the @xmath1sr results seem to support delrieu s predictions , in particular the linear tail .",
    "sans data may also be consistent with them.@xcite however , after more than 40 years there is still no definitive experimental observation of the predicted exotic vl at low temperature .",
    "probably the difficulty of reading the delrieu s works has prevented experimentalists to perform the required combined sans and @xmath1sr measurements .",

    "in fact the phase changes from one position to the next nearest neighbors in a coherent fashion .",
    "because of this long - range coherence , we expect cooper s pair diffraction on the vortex cores",
    ". however , the diffraction can only be partial since the coherent nature of the correlation is only active for a finite set of cooper s pairs , i.e. the balistic ones with trajectory through the vortex cores .",
