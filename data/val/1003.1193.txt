    "to date , more than 40 multiple planetary system have been detected beyond our solar system .",
    "the commensurability of orbital periods is very ubiquitous in the extrasolar planetary systems . at present , four resonant pair of planets ( gj 876 , hd 82943 , hd 128311 , hd 73526 ) are reported to be trapped in 2:1 mean motion resonance @xcite . in recent years , numerous researchers have extensively investigated the dynamics and origin of the 2:1 resonance in the planetary systems @xcite .",
    "the two resonance variables for 2:1 resonance , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the mean longitude and the longitude of periapse respectively , the subscripts 1 , 2 denote the inner and outer planets ) , are categorized to librate about : ( 1)0@xmath5 in symmetric configuration , ( 2 ) both 0@xmath5 and 180@xmath5 respectively , in the so - called antisymmetric configuration , and ( 3 ) other degrees different from 0@xmath5 or 180@xmath5 in asymmetric configuration @xcite .",
    "the gj 876 was revealed to be the first 2:1 resonant system @xcite near an m dwarf star .",
    "the gj 876 system is in apsidal corotation where the mean motion resonance variables , @xmath6 and @xmath7 librate about @xmath8 with quite slight amplitudes . on the origin of mean motion resonances in the system ,",
    "a formation scenario is that they were assembled by migration of planets . in the formation of giant planets ,",
    "if two planets are massive enough to open gaps and not far away from each other in the disk , the material between the region of them can be rapidly cleared off . and",
    "then , the dissipation of the stuff outside the outer planet and inside the inner planet may still force two planets approach each other .",
    "any process that makes two bodies approach each other , which are originally separated appropriately , could result in mean motion orbital resonance @xcite .",
    "lee and collaborators explored the origin and diversity of the 2:1 mean motion resonance @xcite .",
    "they set the two planets on coplanar , circular orbits with , @xmath9 .",
    "the outer planet can migrate toward the center star at a reasonable velocity ( @xcite ; see also @xcite and references therein ) , @xmath10 where @xmath11 , is the kinematic viscosity expressed using the shakura - sunyaev @xmath12-prescription , while @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the height scale of the protoplanetary disk and the orbital angular velocity at @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 is the mass of the center star . in @xmath18 ,",
    "the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 are typical in classical models of protoplanetary disks .",
    "if we adopt @xmath21 , the migration velocity of the planet with @xmath22 , is @xmath23 by @xmath18 .",
    "they find that such migration of the planets can result in resonance capture with the eccentricities of the planets growing quickly .",
    "if the eccentricity damping induced by planet - disk interaction is considered , the system may remain stable over secular timescale after the resonance capture has happened . in such circumstances ,",
    "the eccentricities reach nearly constant values .",
    "the investigations imply that the 2:1 symmetric resonant configurations may be easily established under the forced migration due to planet - disk interaction .    the numerical explorations and theoretical analysis show that the 2:1 resonance planetary configurations could be quite diverse due to different migration in a slightly eccentric disk @xcite .",
    "for example , it is shown that the orbital solutions of the resonant pairs derived from keplerian fit , could result in unstable behaviors @xcite over the timescale of several thousand years in the hd 128311 and hd 73526 systems .",
    "the best - fit dynamical orbital solutions are given in table 1 , which each system can remain stable over @xmath24 yr .",
    "indeed , both of the systems are stabilized by the 2:1 resonance , however , with a librating - circulating resonance configuration .",
    "planetary configurations such as listed in table 1 are not observed to lead to the convergent migration scenario mentioned by lee et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "however , @xcite mentioned several possibilities of the origin of librating - circulating resonance configuration .",
    "the resonance configurations may be formed either through rapid migration or migration with initial planetary eccentricities or via a dynamical scattering event .",
    "@xcite provide a mixed evolutionary scenario for such resonance configuration by combining an adiabatic migration progress and a sudden gravitational perturbation . in their study ,",
    "firstly , they show the planets could be captured into mean motion resonances via inward migration . and",
    "then , they describe a scenario of a sudden stop of inward migration after the resonance capture happened , which is supported by observations of young protoplanetary disk @xcite . finally , a small body ( @xmath25 ) is scattered during the follow - up dynamical evolution of the system .",
    "therefore , the resonance configuration of the system is turned into a librating - circulating stage , and the eccentricities of the planet oscillate with large amplitudes .",
    "the results of the numerical studies are consistent with the dynamical behaviors expressed using solutions listed in table 1 of hd 128311 and hd 73526 planetary systems @xcite .",
    ".dynamical orbital fits for two systems . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      the present observations show that the eccentricities of the extrasolar planets can be much higher on average than those of the solar system .",
    "many potential mechanisms ( such as secular perturbations from a massive planetary companion or passing stars , interactions of orbital migration via mean motion resonance , or planet - planet scattering in the planetary systems , etc . , see details in @xcite ) have been proposed to explain the origin of the distribution of high eccentricities .",
    "based on the realistic initial conditions , @xcite and @xcite show that the combination of planet - planet scattering and tidal circularization may lead to form several close - in giants and reproduce the observed eccentricity distribution .",
    "in addition , in the following we show that planet - planet scattering can also shape the librating - circulating configuration trapped in resonance .",
    "librating - circulating configuration of mean motion resonance may be formed by a single planet scattering event with moderate mass @xcite .",
    "herein , we show an interesting example that is consistent with such mechanism but related to a more complicated physical scenario .",
    "figure 2(a ) illustrates the time evolution of the mass of t2 , and the semi - major axes of three additional terrestrial planets in simulation m2120 . from table 3",
    ", we can clearly notice that t2 and t3 are set close in the initial setup , and then they are rapidly merged together into a larger body at about 100 yr .",
    "due to significant excitation of the eccentricities , the orbital crossings of the terrestrial planets quickly occur and subsequently cause the merging event between t2 and t3 . in figure 2(b ) , we can see the merger t2 remains in a stable orbit for about @xmath24 yr but its eccentricity oscillates with larger amplitudes . and",
    "then the consequence of stirring the eccentricity is that t2 is scattered at @xmath26 @xmath27 yr .",
    "here comes the librating - circulating configuration of the pair giants , where the resonance argument @xmath6 modulates with moderate amplitudes about @xmath8 , and @xmath7 circulates as time evolves .",
    "the difference is that , in our assumptions , the initial conditions of the two giants are simply required to meet @xmath28 ( where the subscripts 1 , 2 denote the inner and outer giant , respectively , hereinafter ) , so their configuration after migration is not required to be exactly trapped into 2:1 resonance , where two resonant angles are initially both in circulating mode . in our model , we are not concerned about how two giants planets move to the orbits close to the 2:1 resonance through certain consequences of migration .",
    "but the initial setup we require is that several terrestrial planets stay inside the region of the inner giant in the gas - free disk after the termination of migration for two giants .",
    "we find that if the masses of the scattered terrestrial planets are low , then the changes of the resonance configurations may reinstate after some while .",
    "generally , small planet scattering is capable of increasing the amplitude of the resonance angles .",
    "it is very likely that continuous scattering events resulting from small planets can alter the configuration of the mean motion resonance .",
    "figure 3 illustrates the results of the simulation of m1204 . in this run",
    ", there are two terrestrial planets with equal masses of @xmath29 initially moving about the giants . from table 3 , we know that , though their semi - major axes are originally approximate to each other , the two terrestrial planets can escape colliding from each other . because the orbit of t1 is a bit broader and less eccentric than that of t2 , and the difference in the mean longitudes of periapse is @xmath30 ( where @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 is the mean anomaly ) , near @xmath33 .",
    "as figure 3 shows , the 2:1 resonance of two giants is initially in symmetric configuration where @xmath34 .",
    "at the time the first terrestrial planet t1 is scattered at 366 yr ( marked by triangles ) , the amplitudes of the resonance angles become enlarged , but the apsidal corotation is maintained . until the second terrestrial planet is scattered at 593 yr , soon after the first scattering event , the apsidal corotation is broken up . and",
    "the eccentricities of two giants @xmath35 and @xmath36 fluctuate with large amplitudes , which is similar to the hd 128311 and hd 73526 systems @xcite . in the circumstances ,",
    "our outcomes are well consistent with those of @xcite .    , @xmath7 , and the eccentricities of the two giants @xmath35 , @xmath36 , for the simulation m1204 .",
    "the sign triangles label the time of two terrestrial objects that scattering happens .",
    "obviously , the resonance configuration after two sequent scattering events of terrestrial planets turns into a librating - circulating state from an original librating - librating mode of @xmath37.,width=302 ]      as shown previously , the librating - circulating configuration can arise from a planet - planet scattering of a moderate mass planet or multiple continuous scattering for small terrestrial planets in the various initial conditions . in this section , we will further focus on the mixture role of merging and collision to generate a librating - circulating mode in the dynamical evolution .",
    "figure 4 shows the results of m1227 , which are involved in the very complicated process of colliding and scattering events . in the initial stage",
    ", there are 4 terrestrial planets in total , and each terrestrial planet bears a pretty smaller mass of @xmath38 . in this scenario",
    ", it is more likely to observe multiple scattering or colliding events ( marked by upper letter _s_ , _c_ , respectively in fig.4 ) over timescale of the dynamical evolution . from the figure",
    ", we can see that the inner giant is hit by t3 , and then t4 is scattered within 500 yr .",
    "however , we may notice that the 2:1 mean motion resonance configuration are not significantly changed , where the first planet - planet scattering event or collision with the inner giant before 500 yr do not modify the oscillating status of two resonance arguments @xmath6 and @xmath7 , due to their smaller planetary masses ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "in the subsequent evolution , t1 and t2 are merged together to form a larger terrestrial body , and the eccentricity of the merger is gradually excited to high values , which triggers the collision between a new @xmath39 body and the outer giant . the second collision event of the merged terrestrial planet and the outer giant occurs at about 3500 yr , which induce the two resonant angles @xmath6 and @xmath7 to go from librating - librating phase into librating - circulating phase .",
    "it is worthy to note that the eccentricities of the giants undergo smaller oscillations .",
    "the reason for the variations of the eccentricities is the conservation of the total momentum , while the impactor loses the momentum and transfers to the outer giant , which gains the momentum .",
    "then the eccentricity @xmath36 is slightly modulated if the semi - major axis remains and further influences @xmath35 of the inner giant .     and @xmath7 , and eccentricity @xmath40 semi - major axis @xmath41 of the terrestrial planet t1 , and the eccentricities @xmath35 , @xmath36 of the two giants for the run of m1227 .",
    "the upper letters _c_ and _s_ denote a collision or scattering event occurs at the corresponding time . collision and scattering events",
    "are observed in the simulation .",
    "however , the first scattering event or collision with the inner giant before 500 yr can not change the vibration status of the resonance angles .",
    "the configuration of mean motion resonance has been triggered to be a librating - circulating mode at 3461 yr , because t1 and t2 are merged into one new bigger terrestrial body , which collides with the outer giant planet at about 3500 yr.,width=302 ]    figure 5 illustrates the evolution of simulation m1205 .",
    "it is similar to the case of m1227 .",
    "however , the difference is that the first _c_ denotes a merging event between t1 and t2 at about 500 yr .",
    "it is not difficult to understand that such merging scenario for two terrestrial planets can not alter the masses of giant planets , and will not cause the variations of their semi - major axes and eccentricities .",
    "however , subsequent evolution is to be expected soon after the first collision .",
    "the second collision occurs between t12 ( as a merged larger body ) and the inner giant at about 1300 yr . in this case",
    ", two resonant arguments @xmath6 and @xmath7 vary from a librating - librating phase into the librating - circulating state . similarly , both of the eccentricities for two giants are slightly modulated .",
    "the above two figures show that a terrestrial planet s colliding with either an inner or outer giant may finally shape librating - circulating configuration of mean motion resonances during the dynamical evolution .",
    "in addition , there are lots of simulations that show the destruction of the systems , where one of the two giants is scattered faraway to interstellar space or even entirely out of a planetary system . in most of our runs ,",
    "we notice that both scattering and colliding events may coexist in the evolution .",
    "the planet - planet scattering model @xcite can well explain the distribution of relatively higher eccentricities of the extrasolar planets in comparison with the observations , and further indicate that much more planets can be excited in the eccentricity in the dynamical evolution . in the late stage of planet formation , the evolution of orbits is quite chaotic , because at that time the terrestrial planets could frequently intersect with each orbit . in this sense",
    ", it is very likely for terrestrial planets or massive planetary embryos to suffer from gravitational scattering and collisions in the system . in final ,",
    "such hybrid mechanism may participate in determining and forming a 2:1 librating - circulating resonant configuration in the planetary system .    in order to examine the limiting conditions for the above mechanism to work , we further performed over 100 sets of simulations to find the minimum masses of the terrestrial planets , which convert librating - circulating status for the giant planets . as for planet - planet scattering case , in simulations related to m1204",
    ", we find that when @xmath42 , the first terrestrial planet t1 hit the inner giant at about 128 yr , and the second terrestrial planet is scattered at 269 yr soon after the first collision event , and the librating - circulating resonance configuration is induced . in other simulations of this group , the terrestrial planet masses @xmath43 can not trigger the librating - circulating resonance configuration . as for merging and collision scenario ,",
    "the additional runs of m1205 shows that when @xmath44 , a merging event between t1 and t2 occurred at about 368 yr , then the second collision occurs between t12 ( as a merged larger body ) and the inner giant at about 671 yr , finally resulting in the librating - circulating configuration of mean motion resonance .",
    "also the simulations related to m1205 show that the librating - circulating resonance configuration of two giant planets can not be formed , when the terrestrial planet masses @xmath45 .",
    "it is not difficult to understand that the presented minimum masses of terrestrial planets have different values in these simulations , to alter the status of the mean motion resonance configuration of the giants .",
    "this is because such conversion of the resonant planetary configuration may mainly not only depend on the terrestrial planet masses , but also rely on their other initial conditions as well .",
    "in this work , we have investigated potential mechanisms to shape 2:1 librating - circulating resonance configuration by considering a planetary system of two giants accompanying with few terrestrial planets with coplanar orbits in the late stage of planet formation . in the model ,",
    "the system is considered to be gas - free , and two giants with commensurable orbits stop migrating and several terrestrial planets have formed inside the inner giant . the configuration is much closer to real planetary formation scenario according to numerical simulations @xcite . in conclusion , we summarize the main results as follows .    in the late stage of planetary formation , planet - planet scattering or colliding among planetesimals and embryos can frequently occur .",
    "our results show that not only a single planetary scattering of a terrestrial planet with a moderate mass can result in the librating - circulating configuration , but several continuous planetary scattering with rather smaller terrestrial masses is also at work .",
    "additionally , if two giant planets are initially engaged in a 2:1 symmetric resonance and their eccentricities oscillate with large amplitudes , the collisions arising from the giants and other small bodies may change librating amplitudes of the resonance angles during the evolution . if the apsidal corotation is disintegrated , the configuration may turn into a librating - circulating status .",
    "obviously , the more mass of a perturbing terrestrial body may have much greater influence on the commensurable giant planets .",
    "in most simulations , colliding and scattering events can be found and they can increase or decrease the fluctuation in the amplitude of the resonant angles , even dramatically destroy the whole system . in a word , the librating - circulating configuration of mean motion resonance is likely to generate by a mixed mechanism of colliding and scattering .",
    "in addition , the librating - circulating configuration could be generated through long - term evolution of planetary formation . a librating - circulating configuration trapped in 3:2 mean motion resonance @xcite is unveiled during the formation of the terrestrial planets , which is similar to the newly - discovered planetary system hd 45346 @xcite .",
    "they show that the two terrestrial planets were formed within 50 myr ( see their figure 6 for details ) , and after that time the frequent orbital crossings of them and their interaction with the inner giant planet may finally lead to a capture of a 3:2 resonance .",
    "such resonant configuration is believed to hold over hundreds of myrs . however , more resonant configurations for less massive planets are expected to reveal by future higher accuracy space - based projects in search for terrestrial planets ( such as tpf , darwin , sim )",
    ". the innovative findings will encourage one to more carefully study their dynamics and origin .",
