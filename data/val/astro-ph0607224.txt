    "the gravitational astronomy is now becoming a reality .",
    "in fact , the ground - based laser interferometers such as tama300 @xcite and the first ligo @xcite are beginning to take data at sensitivities where astrophysical events are predicted . for the detectors including geo600 and virgo , core - collapse supernovae especially in our galaxy ,",
    "have been supposed to be the most plausible sources of gravitational waves ( see , for example , @xcite for review ) . since the gravitational wave ( plus neutrinos ) is the only tool which gives us the information in the innermost part of evolved massive stars , the detection is important not only for the direct confirmation of gravitational waves but also for the understanding of supernova physics itself .",
    "so far , most of the theoretical predictions of gravitational waves from supernovae have focused on the bounce signal in the context of rotational @xcite and magnetorotational @xcite core collapse . in most of the previous studies , the iron core prior to core - collapse was assumed to rotate much more rapidly than predicted by the recent stellar evolution calculations @xcite .",
    "recently , the initial rotation periods were estimated to be larger than @xmath1 100 sec for the observed rotation periods of the radio pulsars @xcite .",
    "in such a slowly rotating case , the bounce signal becomes too small to be detected even by the laser interferometers in the next generation for a galactic supernova , owing to the suppression of the rotation - induced deformation at core - bounce ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "besides the rapid rotation of the cores , two other ingredients have been considered to be important in the much later phases after core bounce , namely convective motions and anisotropic neutrino emissions .",
    "both of them contribute to the non - spherical parts in the energy momentum tensor of the einstein equations , thus being the potential sources of the gravitational wave ( see , @xcite for a review ) .",
    "one of the possibility as the origin of the asphericities may be large scale density inhomogeneities formed in the central core prior to collapse ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite performed three dimensional sph simulations and pointed out that the neutrino - originated gravitational waves , which dominate over the one from the convections , are within the detection limits for the advanced ligo for the galactic supernova ( see also , @xcite ) . another possibility to induce",
    "anisotropy is the ( moderate ) rotation of the core .",
    "@xcite calculated the gravitational waves based on the two - dimensional ( 2d ) boltzmann transport simulations of slowly rotating core @xcite and found that the neutrino - originated gravitational waves exceed the bounce signal large enough to be detectable by the advanced ligo with good signal - to - noise ratio for the galactic supernova ( see , also @xcite for the properties of neutrino - originated gravitational waves in the rapidly rotating case ) .",
    "more recently , the new ingredient of the gravitational - wave emissions is reported @xcite , namely the g - mode excitations of the protoneutron stars , which was observed in the 2d approximate boltzmann transport simulations at much later postbounce phase ( @xmath2 ms ) @xcite .",
    "there is an another ingredient for producing large asphericity , to which much attention has been paid recently in the context of the studies about the explosion mechanisms , that is the so - called standing accretion shock instability ( often called `` sasi '' ) . in the numerical simulations by @xcite , it was found that the standing shock wave is shown to be unstable to non - radial perturbations , and that the perturbations grow up to the non linear regime with clear low - mode ( @xmath3 ) dominance , leading to the global deformation of the shock wave later .",
    "here @xmath4 stands for the azimuthal index of the legendre polynomials .",
    "the importance of sasi is also stressed by the recent studies , demonstrating that such an explosion is favorable to reproduce the observed synthesized elements of sn1987a @xcite and also to explain the origin of the natal kicks of young pulsars @xcite .",
    "these situations motivate us to study how the gravitational waveforms are originated from the asphericities by sasi .    in this paper , we present the results of numerical experiments , in which we study how the asphericities induced by the growth of sasi produce the gravitational waveforms . to obtain the neutrino - driven explosions , we parameterize the neutrino fluxes emitted from the central protoneutron star and approximate the neutrino transfer by the light - bulb scheme . based on the long - term two dimensional hydrodynamic results , we calculate the gravitational waveforms . by doing the spectrum analysis ,",
    "we study the detectability of such signals from a nearby core - collapse supernova . it is noted that much attention has been paid recently to the core - collapse supernovae as one of the promising sources of the cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus we calculate the sasi - induced gravitational wave backgrounds and discuss the detectability by the currently proposed space - based detectors such as lisa , bbo , and decigo @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we outline the initial models , the numerical methods , and shortly summarize the methods for calculating the waveforms .",
    "we show the main numerical results in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "we summarize and discuss our results in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the numerical methods employed in this paper are essentially the same as those used in our previous paper @xcite . the basic evolution equations , describing the compressible accretion flows of matter attracted by the protoneutron star and irradiated by neutrinos emitted from the neutrino sphere , are written as follows , @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 are density , velocity , internal energy , pressure , electron fraction , and gravitational potential , respectively .",
    "we denote the lagrangian derivative as @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the radius .",
    "@xmath13 is the mass of the central object .",
    "the self - gravity of matter in the accretion flow is ignored ( see @xcite for the effect ) .",
    "the parameters of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are related to the standard heating and cooling via neutrino absorptions and emissions by free nucleons ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath16 is the minor additional heating by the inelastic neutrino - helium interactions estimated by @xcite as considered in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we newly take into account the neutrino cooling by neutrino pair annihilation to @xmath17 pairs (:",
    "@xmath18 ) , nucleons - nucleons bremsstrahlung (: @xmath19 ) @xcite , and plasmon decay into @xmath20 (:",
    "@xmath21 ) @xcite .",
    "the numerical code employed in this paper is based on the modified version of the zeus-2d @xcite for the applications to the supernova studies @xcite , in which the tabulated realistic equation of state ( eos ) based on the relativistic mean field theory @xcite was implemented .",
    "furthermore , we have added the equation for electron fraction ( eq .  ( [ eq : ye_flow ] ) ) and included the neutrino coolings / heatings parametrically as the source term of the energy equations ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) ) , both of which are solved in the operator - splitting fashion . in the simulations ,",
    "spherical coordinates are used without imposing the equatorial symmetry .",
    "the computation domain covers the whole meridian section with 60 angular mesh points , except for a model in which we have adopted 120 angular grid points .",
    "since the latter model did not produce any significant difference from other models , we will report in the following the results obtained from the models with 60 angular mesh points .",
    "we use 300 radial mesh points to cover @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the inner boundary and chosen to be roughly the radius of neutrino sphere .",
    "the initial conditions are provided in the same manner of @xcite as the steady state solution of @xcite . in constructing the initial conditions , we assume a fixed density @xmath24  g  @xmath25 at the inner boundary . and the initial mass accretion rates and the initial mass of the central object are set to be @xmath26  s@xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively . to induce the non - spherical instability",
    ", we have added @xmath29 velocity perturbations to the initial state mentioned above .",
    "at the outer boundary , we adopt the fixed boundary condition consistent with the initial condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the absorbing boundary is used at the inner boundary .",
    "the temperatures of electron - type neutrinos are also constant and set to be @xmath30  mev and @xmath31  mev , which are the typical values in the post - bounce phase .",
    "the temperature of mu and tau neutrinos is chosen to be @xmath32  mev . in the standard model , the luminosity of electron - type neutrino @xmath33 and anti - neutrino @xmath34",
    "are set to be @xmath35  ergs  s@xmath27 .",
    "in addition , we examined two cases of lower luminosities of @xmath36  ergs  s@xmath27 .",
    "in all the computed models , the luminosity of mu and tau neutrinos is set to be half value of electron - type neutrinos , keeping consistency with the results obtained by the previous detailed numerical studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we follow the methods based on @xcite in order to compute the gravitational waveform from anisotropic neutrino emissions",
    ". we will summarize it in the following for convenience .",
    "since we assume axisymmetry , the transverse - traceless gravitational field @xmath37 is shown to have one nonvanishing component for the observer in the equatorial plane : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the gravitational constant , @xmath40 is the speed of light , @xmath41 is the distance of the source to the observer , @xmath42 represents the direction - dependent neutrino luminosity emitted per unit of solid angle into direction of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 denotes the quantity , which depends on the angle measured from the symmetry axis ( @xmath45 ) ( see figure [ phi ] ) , @xmath46 the integration with respect to the azimuthal angle ( @xmath47 ) , albeit fairly straightforward , is pretty helpful to the later discussions , which is not published to our knowledge .",
    "in addition , from eq .",
    "( [ graph1 ] ) , one can readily see that no gravitational waves are emitted if the neutrino radiation is isotropic .",
    "we estimate @xmath42 as follows , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the sum of contributions from the neutrino coolings , of each species ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 ) computed from the source term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : energy ] ) . in the above estimation",
    ", neutrinos are assumed to be emitted radially in each angular bin .    as a guide to see the anisotropy of the neutrino emissions , we calculate the anisotropy parameter according to @xcite as follows ,",
    "@xmath54 it should be noted that the gravitational waves from neutrinos have a different feature from the ones from matter motions , in the sense that the former has _",
    "memory effect _ , which means that the gravitational amplitude jumps from zero to a nonvanishing value and it keeps the non - vanishing value even after the energy source of gravitational waves disappeared ( see @xcite for details , and @xcite for the examples of the astrophysical emitters of such gravitational waves and references therein ) . in eq .",
    "( [ tt ] ) , this nature can be directly seen as the time - integral .",
    "as for the gravitational waves , @xmath55 , of the quadrupole radiation of mass motions , we employ the standard strain formula , @xmath56 where the form of @xmath57 can be found in references ( see equation ( 12 ) in @xcite ) . in using the formula , the azimuthal gradient of the gravitational potential is set to be zero , since we neglect the self - gravity of the computational domain and treat the gravity as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : domain_g ] ) . in the following computations , we assume that the observer is located in the equatorial plane since the most of gravitational wave is radiated in the plane ( @xmath58 in eq .",
    "( [ htt ] ) ) , and that the source is assumed to be located at our galactic center ( @xmath59 ) . in order to assess the detectability of the gravitational waves obtained in this study , we employ the characteristic gravitational wave strain , @xmath60 for a given frequency @xmath61 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath62 is the energy spectra of gravitational waves defined as follows , @xmath63 we employ the fast fourier transformation technique in order to perform the fourier transformation of @xmath64 to @xmath65 .",
    "we discuss the contribution of the gravitational waves mentioned above to the cosmological background gravitational radiation . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume that all core - collapse supernovae have identical emission characteristics . according to @xcite , the density parameter , which represents the sum of energy densities radiated by a large number of independent core - collapse supernovae at each redshift ,",
    "can be written as , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the cosmic critical density , @xmath68 is the event rate of core - collapse supernovae per comoving volume , and @xmath69 .",

    "we employ the parameterization by @xcite as follows , @xmath76    we take @xmath77 and the present - day rate @xmath78 , which are consistent with the super - k limits on the diffuse neutrino background @xcite . since the parameter @xmath79 is much less constrained than @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) , we examine the two cases of @xmath82 in the later discussion .",

    "only in the case of @xmath89 , we can observe the continuous increase of the average shock radius , reaching the outer boundary of the computational domain ( 2000 km in radius ) in @xmath90 ms with the explosion energy of @xmath91 ergs .",
    "in other models , we terminate the simulations at about 1 sec , not seeing the increase of the shock radius . bearing in mind the evidences that the sasi - induced explosions are favorable for explaining the observed quantities of supernovae mentioned earlier , we take the exploding model of @xmath92 as a reference in the following . for later convenience ,",
    "the values of several important quantities are summarized in table [ table1 ] .      in the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] ,",
    "the total amplitudes including the contributions both from the anisotropic neutrino emissions and the matter motions , are shown . comparing the right panel , in which the amplitudes only from the matter motions are shown",
    ", we can see the neutrino - originated gravitational waves are up to two order - of - magnitudes larger than those from the matter motions during the sasi operation ( at @xmath93 ms as explained shortly ) .",
    "this reflects the small mass in the regions outside the neutrino sphere in the postbounce phase ( at most @xmath94 throughout the simulation time ) . in the following , we pay attention to the neutrino - originated gravitational wave .",
    "looking at the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] , the waveforms show the monotonic increase with time regardless of the input neutrino luminosities . to understand this trend",
    ", we look into the hydrodynamical behaviors induced by the sasi , taking the case of @xmath89 .    in figure",
    "[ color1 ] , snapshots showing the hydrodynamical features with the resulting gravitational wave amplitudes ( inserted figures ) are shown .",
    "up to @xmath1 100 ms after the onset of the simulation , no significant changes in the amplitudes and no deviations of the dynamics from spherical symmetry are found .",
    "it is noted that no gravitational waves are emitted when the motion of the regions outside is spherical , since the neutrino luminosity from the center is taken to be isotropic .",
    "after @xmath1 100 ms , the regions outside the neutrino sphere begin to oscillate with increasing average radius and wave amplitudes .",
    "the reason why the sign of the growing amplitudes is positive is as follows . from the angular dependence of @xmath95 in figure [ phi ] and eq .",
    "( [ graph1 ] ) , it can be seen that the neutrino emissions from the regions with @xmath45 smaller than @xmath96 contribute to the positive amplitude , while the negative sign comes from the regions from @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "it is noted that this feature is north - south symmetric ( eq .",
    "( [ graph1 ] ) ) . due to the dominance of @xmath98 modes of the deformed shock waves during the sasi operation mentioned below",
    ", the neutrino emissions become stronger in the regions close to the symmetry axis . by these two factors ,",
    "the amplitudes are found to increase monotonically with time .",
    "this property is common to the lower luminosity models as seen from the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] . as a side - remark ,",
    "the contribution of each neutrino species to the waveform is presented in figure [ contribution ] , which also shows the dominant contribution from @xmath99 .",
    "next we discuss in more detail how the features of the waveforms are related to the growth of the sasi . for the purpose ,",
    "we decompose the fluctuations of the shock surface into the spherical harmonic components ; @xmath100 since the system is axisymmetric , only @xmath101 harmonics , that is legendre polynomials , show up .",
    "the coefficients , @xmath102 , can be calculated by the orthogonality of the legendre polynomials ; @xmath103 the position of the shock surface , @xmath104 , is estimated from the iso - entropic surface of @xmath105 .",
    "the left panel of figure [ saturation ] shows the evolution of the amplitude of each mode ( @xmath106 ) normalized by the average shock radius of @xmath107 .",
    "the dominance of the fundamental mode ( @xmath108 ) initially is simply due to the initial velocity perturbation assumed in this simulation . from @xmath109",
    ", @xmath110 begins to develop rapidly and at @xmath111 , the amplitude becomes of the same order as that of the fundamental mode , which has already been saturated by this time .",
    "this marks the beginning of the nonlinear phase .",
    "this transition from linear to nonlinear phase corresponds to the time of the rapid increase of the average shock radius as seen from the top right ( @xmath112 ms ) to middle left panel ( @xmath113 ms ) in figure [ color1 ] .",
    "simultaneously , this makes the deformation of the shock more elongated along the symmetry axis , leading to the slightly steep rise of the neutrino - originated gravitational wave afterwards for the reason mentioned above ( see the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] ) . here",
    "it should be noted that the dominance of @xmath110 mode induces the rapid increase of the gravitational waves from the matter motions , albeit its amplitudes being very small , and is clearly understood from the quadrupole nature of gravitational radiations ( compare the left and right panels of figure [ saturation ] ) .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath114 in eq.([anisop ] ) also helps us to see the relation between the anisotropy of the neutrino radiation fields and the properties of the waveforms .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath115 is presented in figure [ alpha_figure ] . in case of @xmath116",
    ", @xmath115 takes larger values after the saturation , leading to more greater wave amplitudes . in the right panel of figure [ alpha_figure ] , the ratios of the wave amplitudes of @xmath116 and @xmath117 to @xmath118 , are shown . only near after the nonlinear phase sets in ( @xmath112 ms ) , it is seen that the sasi - induced anisotropy of the neutrino emissions determines the waveforms , whose amplitudes monotonically grow with time . as a reference , we draw the lines indicating the ratio of the input neutrino luminosities .",
    "it can be also seen that the increase of the amplitudes is greater than the one estimated only by the difference of the input luminosities after the onset of the nonlinear phase .",
    "finally , we have to discuss whether the above discussions are subject to change when the numerical resolution becomes more better . in figure",
    "[ resol_figure ] , we compare the waveforms when the angular resolution is doubled in comparison with the model computed so far .",
    "as easily guessed , the difference appears after the sasi saturates ( @xmath112 ms ) and the non - linear phase sets in . in the lower resolution calculation",
    ", the anisotropy of the shock propagation tends to become more larger than the high resolution case , which results in the larger neutrino anisotropy , and thus leading to the larger wave amplitudes .",
    "the difference is not greater than @xmath119 , and thus the qualitative features discussed so far are found to be unchanged .",
    "now we move on to discuss the features of the waveforms by the spectrum analysis . from figure [ spectrum ]",
    ", one can see the dominance of the neutrino - originated gravitational waves at lower frequency of @xmath0 hz .",
    "as seen in the left panel of figure [ fig2 ] , the waveform from the neutrino shows a long - time variability in comparison with the rapidly varying ( @xmath120 waveforms from matter motions , which is due to the local hydrodynamical instabilities .",
    "it is the memory effect of the neutrino - originated gravitational waves mentioned earlier that absorbs the rapid time variations of the neutrino anisotropy .    to see clearly the dominance of the neutrino - originated gravitational wave than the matter - originated one at the lower frequency , we define @xmath121 , the frequency below which the dominance occurs , and the corresponding gravitational wave amplitude , @xmath122 ( see table [ table1 ] ) . from the table",
    ", it is found that the typical frequency is smaller for the higher luminosity case . in figure",
    "[ all_spectrum ] , the gravitational wave spectra are plotted with the sensitivity curves of the laser interferometers . it can be seen that the detection of the gravitational wave at the low frequency range becomes more promising thanks to the contributions from the neutrinos .",
    "it can be seen that the gravitational waves from the neutrinos , which are dominated below @xmath0 hz , seem marginally within the detection limits of the currently running detector of the first ligo and the detection seems more feasible for the detectors in the next generation such as lcgt and the advanced ligo if a supernova occurs in our galactic center .    finally , we are in a position to discuss the contribution of the gravitational waves mentioned so far to the background gravitational radiation .",
    "we calculate @xmath123 from eqs .",
    "( [ fourier2 ] ) and ( [ los ] ) for the highest luminosity case of @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting amplitude is presented in figure [ gwb ] .",
    "for the frequency greater than @xmath0 hz , the signal is dominated by the contribution from matter motions , while at lower frequencies the signal is dominated by the one from the neutrinos ( compare figure [ all_spectrum ] ) . `` low rate '' and `` high rate''in the figure correspond to the cases of @xmath124 in eq .",
    "( [ evol ] ) , respectively , indicating the uncertainty of the core - collapse supernova rate as mentioned before .",
    "we terminated the simulation for the high luminosity case ( see table [ table1 ] ) , seeing the shock wave propagate out of the iron core .",
    "for the frequencies of @xmath125 obtained from our simulations , we extended the spectra using the zero frequency limit @xcite as implemented in the study of @xcite .",
    "`` upper bound '' denotes the most optimistic estimation . in the case of @xmath89 ,",
    "about 30 @xmath126 of the available gravitational binding energy of the neutron star of @xmath127 may be emitted during the simulation of @xmath128 ms followed here . from figure [ fig2 ] showing the monotonic increase of the neutrino - originated amplitudes , we multiply the amplitude for the case of `` high rate '' by an enhancement factor of 3 and consider it as an upper bound . then from figure",
    "[ gwb ] , we may say that the background radiation considered here could be larger for the frequency above @xmath1 1 hz than the upper limit of the background radiation generated in the inflationary epoch ( the horizontal line in the figure ) .",
    "however , the frequency range is just outside the sensitivity of the proposed detectors , such as decigo @xcite .",
    "we presented the results of numerical experiments , in which we studied how the asphericities induced by the growth of the standing accretion shock instability could produce the gravitational waveforms in the postbounce phase of core - collapse supernovae . to obtain the neutrino - driven explosions , we parametrized the neutrino fluxes emitted from the central protoneutron star and approximated the neutrino transfer by the light - bulb scheme . by doing the spectrum analysis of the waveforms , we investigated the detectability of the signals from a single core - collapse supernova and the cosmological ones by the ground - based and space - based laser interferometers , respectively .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows .",
    "the amplitudes of the gravitational waves from the anisotropic neutrino emissions are larger up to two orders of magnitudes than the ones from the matter motions during the sasi operations .",
    "it is found that the wave amplitudes from the neutrinos show the monotonic increase with time , regardless of the neutrino luminosities from the protoneutron star .",
    "we point out that this feature can be understood by the specific nature of sasi , which makes the deformation of the shock waves of @xmath98 modes dominant , leading to the enhanced neutrino emissions in the regions close to the symmetry axis .",
    "in fact , we show that the amplitudes become larger when the growth of the sasi enters the nonlinear phase , in which the deformation of the shocks and the neutrino anisotropy become large .    \\2 . from the spectrum analysis of the waveforms",
    ", we find that the amplitudes from the anisotropic neutrino emissions are dominant over the ones from the matter motions at frequency @xmath129 hz .",
    "the detection of such signals from a galactic supernova may be marginal for the currently running detector of the first ligo and promising for the detectors in the next generation such as lcgt and the advanced ligo .",
    "\\3 . as for the background radiation",
    ", we indicate that the contribution of the gravitational signals considered here could be larger at frequency @xmath130 1 hz than the primordial gravitational wave backgrounds generated in the inflationary epoch .",
    "unfortunately , however , it is found that this frequency range is just outside of the sensitivity of the proposed detectors , such as decigo .",
    "we give a brief comparison with recently published models .",
    "the monotonic increase with time in the wave amplitudes of the neutrino - originated gravitational waves is consistent with the model s15r of @xcite , in which the operation of the sasi was seen .",
    "however , the amplitudes here are typically larger ( up to 1 order of magnitude )",
    ". this should be mainly because the neutrino luminosity here is taken to be higher than the one obtained in @xcite , which is about @xmath131 erg / s during the sasi operation .",
    "as for the total gravitational - wave energy emission , typical values of the computed models here ( @xmath132 , see table 1 ) are one order magnitude smaller than the one in @xcite .",
    "this should be owing to the excision of the protoneutron star , by which the contribution from the high frequency domain of the energy emissions are eliminated in this study .",
    "it should be noted that the larger oscillations of the protoneutron star in the postbounce phase @xcite and the resulting efficient gravitational emissions @xcite can not be treated in principle here .",
    "the simulation highlighted here is nothing but an idealized study for the physical understanding of relation between the asphericities induced by the sasi and the resulting gravitational waves . remembering the caveats about the assumptions of the artificially constructed initial condition , the fixed accretion rate , the absorbing boundary condition , and the fixed neutrino luminosity and energies , it is by no means definitive at all . especially , much better neutrino transfer is indispensable for more reliable calculations of the neutrino - originated gravitational wave , which we only considered the radial transport .",
    "one more major deficit is the axial symmetry assumed in the present two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations . in three - dimensional environments ,",
    "the pronounced dominance of @xmath133 along the symmetry axis , which is a coordinate singularity in the 2d computations , may become weaker , owing to the additional spatial degree of freedom in the azimuthal ( @xmath134 ) direction . in the 3d case",
    ", we think that the qualitative features of the plus mode waveform computed in the 2d case here will be unchanged , but quantitatively , we expect that the amplitudes become smaller owing to the reduced anisotropy along the symmetry axis .",
    "thus the amplitudes calculated in this study could be an upper bound , in which the maximal anisotropy of the shock waves and thus neutrino emissions outside the neutrino sphere could be achieved .",
    "furthermore we think that it is interesting to investigate the properties of the cross mode gravitational waves , which are of genuine 3d origin and could be possibly produced from the transfer of the @xmath98 modes to some modes with nonvanishing @xmath135 in @xmath136 .",
    "this study is a prelude to the forthcoming 3d simulations to clarify those aspects , which will be presented elsewhere .",

    "<S> we present the results of numerical experiments , in which we study how the asphericities induced by the growth of the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ) produce the gravitational waveforms in the postbounce phase of core - collapse supernovae . to obtain the neutrino - driven explosions , </S>",
    "<S> we parameterize the neutrino fluxes emitted from the central protoneutron star and approximate the neutrino transfer by a light - bulb scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the waveforms due to the anisotropic neutrino emissions show the monotonic increase with time , whose amplitudes are up to two order - of - magnitudes larger than the ones from the convective matter motions outside the protoneutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the amplitudes begin to become larger when the growth of the sasi enters the nonlinear phase , in which the deformation of the shocks and the neutrino anisotropy become large . from the spectrum analysis of the waveforms </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the amplitudes from the neutrinos are dominant over the ones from the matter motions at the frequency below @xmath0 hz , which are suggested to be within the detection limits of the detectors in the next generation such as lcgt and the advanced ligo for a supernova at 10 kpc . as a contribution to the gravitational wave background , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the amplitudes from this source could be larger at the frequency above @xmath1 1 hz than the primordial gravitational wave backgrounds , but unfortunately , invisible to the proposed space - based detectors . </S>"
