    "in this study , we address the issue of predicting the glaucomatous visual field loss based on patient datasets .",
    "glaucoma is an eye disease that eventually losses the visual field .",
    "the goal of the present study is to accurately predict the glaucoma progression using small visual field datasets . because measurements of visual field is expensive , early prediction of glaucoma progression based on limited measurements is important for real clinical settings .",
    "a conventional approach for predicting visual field loss is _ patient - wise linear regression _ @xcite and _ clustering - based method _ @xcite . in patient - wise linear regression , we construct a predictor for each individual patient .",
    "however , as the number of measurements for each patient is very small , we can not produce a good predictor for individuals .",
    "liang et al . proposed a clustering - based method for glaucoma progression which utilizes spatiotemporal disease patterns .",
    "each patient is categorized into a cluster based on each spatiotemporal pattern .",
    "then , for each cluster , a linear regression predictor is constructed . a predictor formed from a single cluster",
    "is called a _",
    "cluster - based predictor _ ; the clustering - based method selects an appropriate pattern from a pool of cluster - based predictors .",
    "the prediction accuracy of this method is highly dependent on the quality of the clustering method .",
    "furthermore , a clustering - based method will not work well if the target patient is not a typical member of clusters .",
    "the aim of the present study is to overcome this weakness in clustering - based methods .",
    "we propose a novel framework for aggregating a number of cluster - based predictors .",
    "this significantly improves the prediction accuracy over that of a single cluster - based predictor in the case of real glaucoma patient datasets .",
    "we present a schematic illustration of our approach in fig .",
    "[ fig : predictingglaucoma ] .",
    "in addition to conventional patient - wise linear regression and clustering - based methods @xcite , various techniques have been developed to predict the visual field loss in glaucoma patients .",
    "bengtsson et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the _ visual field index _ ( vfi ) , and showed that only five measurements were needed to produce a correlation coefficient of 0.84 with the vfi obtained using all measurements .",
    "russell et al .",
    "@xcite used bayesian linear regression to derive the _ mean sensitivity _ index .",
    "they showed that their approach outperformed the ordinary linear regression method when there were fewer than nine measurements .",
    "murata et al . proposed a variational bayesian learning method @xcite .",
    "maya et al .",
    "proposed a multi - task learning method to predict the visual field loss , using matrix decomposition @xcite .",
    "maya et al . also proposed a hierarchical mdl - based clustering method to detect progressive patterns of glaucoma @xcite .",
    "recently , tomoda et al . proposed a prediction method utilizing information of eye pressure @xcite .",
    "other methods were reviewed by liang et al .",
    "@xcite , including those reported by noureddin et al .",

    "however , the best predictor for each patient will differ according to his / her disease features . in this context",
    ", it is crucial to investigate a strategy to aggregate these prediction methods and automatically to generate the best prediction .",
    "thus , the present study addresses the issue of combining several prediction methods to obtain a better prediction than that produced using a single method .",
    "such aggregating strategies have worked well in other applications , for example , the issue of predicting prostate specific antigen from short time series @xcite .",
    "we propose a new aggregating strategy based on a previously proposed _ aggregating algorithm _",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) . in this method ,",
    "each predictor is treated as an _ expert _ , and the prediction is obtained by taking a weighted average of all experts predictions . in theory , this method performs almost as well as the best expert in terms of the worst - case regret .",
    "however , in practice , the aggregating algorithm outperforms all of the experts in terms of the instantaneous prediction loss .    the novelty of the present study is a novel aggregating algorithm which is adapted to glaucoma visual loss prediction",
    ": we modify the original aggregating algorithm as follows to enable its practical application to the specialized setting of glaucoma visual loss prediction :    \\1 ) _ learning rate adaptation _ :",
    "the learning rate is estimated using training examples to maximize the improvement rate .",
    "this indicates the improvement in prediction loss relative to the patient - wise linear prediction .",
    "this learning rate achieves better performance than the theoretically designed learning rate .",
    "\\2 ) _ batch learning adaptation _ : the expert weights are determined in a batch process , rather than the online process employed in the original aggregating algorithm .",
    "the modified algorithm optimizes the use of all patient data , thereby producing better predictions than the original method .",
    "\\3 ) _ hierarchical aggregation _ : we propose an aggregation process , the _ hierarchical aggregating strategy_. this method first aggregates all cluster - based predictors from a single clustering method to obtain intermediate predictors , then aggregates these intermediate predictors ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic_ill](c ) ) .",
    "when we have several clustering - based methods , we can aggregate several types of experts .",
    "a facile idea is aggregating all cluster - based predictors over all the clustering methods at once ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : schematic_ill](b ) ) .",
    "we call this simple method the _ flat aggregating strategy_. although the performance of the flat aggregation is better than clustering - based methods , our analysis indicates that this hierarchical aggregating strategy exhibits much better performance than the flat aggregating strategy .",
    "the significance of this study can be summarized as follows :    \\a ) _ better use of predictors in the area of glaucoma visual field loss _ :",
    "we demonstrate that our proposed method delivers better prediction accuracy than the flat aggregating strategy , the conventional clustering - based methods , and patient - wise linear regression .",
    "\\b ) _ a new framework for aggregating visual field loss predictors _ : there are a number of promising methods for predicting glaucoma visual field loss , and many more are expected to be proposed in the future .",
    "thus , our method provides a general strategy whereby new methods do not have to compete with existing methods .",
    "instead , our approach allows numerous methods to collaborate in the hierarchical aggregation framework .",
    "therefore , by adding new methods to the pool of experts , our hierarchical aggregation approach obtains better predictions than those given by previous techniques .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "overview ] , we describe the prediction of visual fields .",
    "section [ sec : reviewaa ] reviews the aggregating algorithm , and section [ sec : generatingexperts ] discusses the construction of experts from clustering - based methods . in section [ sec : algorithm_acm ] , we present the details of our modification of the existing aggregating algorithm , and present our experimental results in section [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains our concluding remarks and discussion .",
    "in the present study , the patient visual field comprises 74 scalar real values .",
    "each value is the _ total deviation _ ( td ) , which corresponds to the visual loss at each local point of the visual field .",
    "we denote these values in vector form as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the td of the @xmath3th point in the visual field , and @xmath4 is the number of points . in our algorithm ,",
    "observations of the target patient s visual field are given in this vector form .",
    "the prediction problem is formalized as follows : at time @xmath5 , given past data @xmath6 , we predict @xmath7 with @xmath8 using @xmath9 . through a clustering method , we generate a _ cluster - based predictor _ from the cluster containing @xmath9 .",
    "these predictors enables us to produce a prediction using the above vector formalism .",
    "we introduce the basic framework of an existing aggregating algorithm @xcite .",
    "this method predicts @xmath10 at time @xmath5 by combining various _ expert _ predictions during each time step , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the @xmath3th expert s prediction at time @xmath5 and @xmath13 is the number of experts .",
    "the weights @xmath14 are updated automatically using the loss function @xmath15 of expert prediction @xmath12 for outcome @xmath16 as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a constant called the _ learning rate_. the weight assigned to an expert decreases when the difference between its prediction and the observation is larger .",
    "this difference is evaluated using loss functions , e.g. , @xmath19 .",
    "the performance of this aggregating algorithm is evaluated based on the _ regret _ , which is defined as @xmath20 .",
    "the upper bound of the regret is known to be @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the optimal learning rate @xmath22 is derived by minimizing the regret to @xmath23 .",
    "we call this theoretically optimal learning rate @xmath24 the _ regret _ ( rg)-_optimal _ @xmath18 . for more details , see @xcite .",
    "in this section , we explain how to construct experts from existing clustering methods . in the process of prediction with a single clustering method ,",
    "a cluster - based predictor is generated for each cluster .",
    "the most suitable predictor then gives the prediction .",
    "such clustering - based methods often produce good predictions , but it is not clear whether the selected predictor is optimal . if the target patient is not adequately represented by a single cluster , none of the cluster - based predictors will produce sufficiently accurate predictions . in this case , combining the contributions from several clusters may improve the prediction accuracy . therefore , we can think of cluster - based predictors as experts , and aggregate them to produce better predictions .",
    "the process of generating experts from clustering - based methods is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_ill](a ) .",
    "liang et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a spatiotemporal clustering algorithm that predicts the progress of glaucoma using past patient information .",
    "the algorithm comprises a spatial feature clustering method and a prediction module that uses the temporal characteristics of each spatial cluster .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatiotemporal ] .",
    "we employ the spatial feature clustering method ( called _ uv - em _ ) proposed in @xcite .",
    "this is an _ expectation - maximization _ ( em )",
    "algorithm that learns the spatial cluster centers and temporal feature vectors of glaucoma patients visual fields .    from the clinical knowledge that td decreases linearly over time , we assume that the clustering - based predictors can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the predicted tds at time @xmath5 , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the progression rate and initial td , respectively .",
    "these predictors are constructed using the following two methods .",
    "the first method is _ temporal - shift linear regression_(_tslr _ ) , where the disease progression rate of all patients belonging to the same spatial cluster is assumed to be the same .",
    "however , the initial state of the disease can be different in each patient .",
    "thus , we obtain a cluster - based predictor through linear regression by applying optimal time - shifts to the patients within a cluster . the second method is _",
    "slope clustering_(_sc _ ) , where there are at most @xmath29 progression rates for local visual points in each spatial cluster",
    ".    these predictions are more accurate than the traditional patient - wise lr predictors @xcite , which implies that these clustering - based methods represent the characteristic of glaucoma patient datasets .",
    "hereafter , we denote uv - em + sc as sc and uv - em + tslr as tslr for simplicity ( for more details , see @xcite ) .      next , we explain how to construct experts using tslr , sc , and patient - wise lr .",
    "each expert is a linear function of time , as in ( [ eq : linearpredictioncluster ] ) . under tslr",
    ", @xmath27 is as the cluster - based predictor s gradients . for sc",
    ", @xmath27 is the same as that of patients within the training datasets , and are selected from @xmath30 .",
    "patient - wise lr gives @xmath27 by linearly regressing each patient .",
    "the initial disease state @xmath28 is determined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the @xmath5th date , @xmath16 is the @xmath5th observation , and @xmath33 is the number of observations .",
    "this is obtained by minimizing the errors @xmath34 .",
    "the pair @xmath27 , @xmath28 defines an expert in the proposed framework .",
    "to utilize the experts introduced above , we modify the original aggregating algorithm as follows : 1 ) the learning rate @xmath18 is selected to ensure that it is practical ; 2 ) the weight is determined in a batch process , rather than an online process ; 3 ) a hierarchical aggregation algorithm is applied to the clustering - based methods .",

    "the value of @xmath43 is @xmath44 if @xmath45 , and @xmath46 otherwise . here , @xmath47 is the rmse of the @xmath3th patient using patient - wise lr , and @xmath48 is the rmse using prediction method @xmath49",
    ". the larger the value of ir , the greater the improvement of @xmath49 relative to the patient - wise lr . when @xmath49 has the same accuracy as the patient - wise lr , ir @xmath50 .",
    "we empirically determine the _ improvement - rate _",
    "( ir)_-optimal _ @xmath18 by maximizing the ir .      in the usual online algorithm ,",
    "the expert weights are updated after each new observation . for the glaucoma datasets ,",
    "samples are usually obtained at intervals of a few months .",
    "thus , it is natural to use all available data points to determine the weights of the experts .",
    "our method employs the following batch update rule : @xmath51 , which replaces the traditional rule ( [ eq : update_online ] ) .",
    "we propose a hierarchical aggregating strategy , where all the predictors given by each single clustering - based method are first aggregated to construct intermediate predictors .",
    "these intermediate predictors are then aggregated to construct the final predictor ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_ill](c ) ) .",
    "the purpose of the proposed method is to adequately deal with experts generated from a small expert source .",
    "the number of experts generated from each clustering - based method is naturally different . in the flat aggregating strategy ,",
    "a good expert belonging to a small community may not greatly affect the prediction because a large community gathers considerable expert weights .",
    "on the contrary , in the hierarchical aggregating strategy , experts within each community are aggregated to generate intermediate predictors . then",
    ", the final prediction is given by aggregating intermediate predictors that only one intermediate predictor belongs to each community .",
    "therefore , such effects on the biased community size may be canceled at the second aggregation . in the real glaucoma datasets ,",
    "the number of experts generated from clustering - based methods is widely distributed , therefore , our proposed method showed the best performance among all the methods as shown in the next section  [ sec : experiment ] .",
    "we compare the effectiveness of our proposed hierarchical aggregating strategy against a single cluster - based predictor for glaucoma datasets .",
    "the dataset used in this study is the same as that used by liang et al .",
    "we divided the dataset into two parts , a learning set ( @xmath52 , 977 patients ) and a test set ( @xmath53 , 109 patients ) . in the learning period",
    ", we constructed experts using clustering methods , and used them to determine rg - optimal and ir - optimal @xmath18 values . in the test period",
    ", we predicted the final observation point for each patient .",
    "the prediction errors were evaluated using ten - fold cross - validation .",
    "we set the number of spatial clusters to @xmath54 and the number of slope clusters to @xmath55 , as reported in @xcite . in our dataset , @xmath56 .",
    "clusters were omitted if they contains fewer than three patients .",
    "lr , sc , and tslr gave 977 , 977 , and 38 experts , respectively .",
    "for all calculations , we used the loss function @xmath57 .",
    "the ir - optimal @xmath18 is obtained through ten - fold cross - validation using portions of the learning dataset . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : obt_eta ] , ir attained peaks at different values of @xmath58 .",
    "the ir - optimal @xmath18 generally agrees with the optimal @xmath18 obtained using the test dataset .",
    "however , the rg - optimal @xmath18 are clearly smaller than the optima .",
    "[ tbl : tslrandsc ]    [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      hierarchical aggregation outperformed the flat aggregating strategy for the following reasons . if there are a few experts , those with larger weights ( i.e. , better experts ) in a clustering method will lose their influence in the flat aggregating strategy , because the initial weight becomes small during the flat aggregation process over a large number of experts .",
    "such experts will survive in the hierarchical aggregating strategy , because this approach gives equal initial weights to all clustering methods , regardless of how many experts they include .",
    "in other words , the hierarchical aggregating strategy has a mechanism whereby good predictors in a small community ( i.e. , a clustering - based method with a small number of experts ) can thrive .",
    "this works particularly well when the number of experts varies widely across all of the cluster - based methods .",
    "this was the case in our experiments where the three clustering - based methods had 977 , 977 , and 38 experts for lr , sc , and tslr , respectively , and tslr produced a very good predictor ( see table  [ tbl : all ] ) .",
    "when the number of experts does not deviate widely , the advantages of the hierarchical strategy are not so pronounced .",
    "such a situation might cause the data to be overfitted through the repeated aggregation . hence , whether flat or hierarchical aggregation is preferable depends on the distribution of the experts in the clustering - based methods , as well as the nature of the data itself .",
    "in the present study , we have developed prediction algorithms that aggregate the experts generated by clustering - based methods .",
    "our aggregation framework has been then applied to the prediction of glaucoma progression .",
    "there are three main differences between our proposed method and the existing approach .",

    "second , the expert weights are determined by using a batch process .",
    "third , we have examined the hierarchical aggregating strategies for multiple clustering - based methods .",
    "we found that the hierarchical aggregating strategy gives consistently better predictions than the traditional patient - wise linear regression , single clustering - based methods , the best expert , and the flat aggregation .",
    "the findings reported here may contribute to knowledge discovery and data mining by connecting clustering methods and predictions through aggregation algorithms .",
    "our method for aggregating experts generated several clustering methods that obtained better prediction results than the original clustering - based method .",
    "this suggests that the prediction accuracy could be further improved by embedding additional clustering methods .    from a clinical significance viewpoint ,",
    "our method may help to establish good predictions of glaucoma progression .",
    "in addition to its good prediction performance , our framework of aggregating cluster - based predictors may be sufficiently flexible to include other clustering methods and predictors , because the algorithm does not assume any specific constraints",
    ". this flexibility will allow clinicians to add novel prediction methods .",
    "therefore , our method will contribute to improving the future performance of glaucoma predictions .",
