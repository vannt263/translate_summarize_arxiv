    "controlling dynamics of quantum systems is of crucial importance for many practical purposes .",
    "a widely used method is to drive the system with external time - dependent interactions , making the total hamiltonian , @xmath1 depend explicitly on time .",
    "the change in time is managed to be slow to allow adiabatic passage from an initial state to a target state . under the adiabatic following condition",
    ", it is likely that the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath2 are the moving states .",
    "that is , each of them evolves along itself all the time without transition to other ones @xcite .    however , that is not precise .",
    "in fact , transitions between different time - dependent instantaneous eigenstates may still happen with nonzero probabilities which become nonnegligible if the controlling parameters do not change slowly enough , reducing fidelity of the evolved state with respect to the target one .",
    "thus , controlling quantum states based on adiabatic passage is by its nature a long process @xcite . if the required evolution time is too long , the method may be useless , because decoherence , noise or losses would spoil the intended dynamics .",
    "this limits application ranges in practice , especially in the field of quantum computing and quantum information processing where speed is of primary concern .",
    "therefore , accelerating the dynamics towards the perfect final outcome is a nice idea and perhaps the most reasonable way to actually fight against the decoherence , noise or losses that are accumulated during a long operation time .",
    "so far various schemes for shortcuts to slow adiabatic passage method for arriving at a target state from an initial state have been proposed in theory @xcite and implemented in experiment @xcite . to be useful",
    ", such nonadiabatic shortcuts must , of course , be reliable , fast and robust .",
    "notably , as pointed out by berry @xcite , a nearly hamiltonian @xmath3 which is associated with any given reference hamiltonian @xmath4 exists that derives instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath2 exactly , i.e. , transitions between them do not occur at all during the whole duration of system evolution regardless of the rate of changing .",
    "in other words , the instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath2 can be regarded as truly moving eigenstates of @xmath5 because of such feature of the driving berry called it `` transitionless quantum driving '' and @xmath6 the `` counter - diabatic driving '' ( cdd ) hamiltonian .",
    "more importantly , berry also worked out a general `` transitionless tracking algorithm '' to reverse engineer @xmath6 from @xmath7 recently , transitionless quantum drivings in berry s spirit have been experimentally demonstrated in the effective two - level system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , chen _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have also put forward another reverse engineering approach using the lewis - riesenfeld ( lr ) invariant to carry the eigenstates of a hamiltonian from a specified initial to a final configuration , then to design the transient hamiltonian from the lr invariant .",
    "although different in form , those driving methods are shown to be essentially equivalent to each other by properly adjusting the reference hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that , although the reverse engineering approach has been applied to achieve accelerated population transfer between two internal states of a single atom in different systems , fast population transfer between two atoms inside a common environment has not been studied adequately , to our knowledge . in view of the requirements for scalable quantum computing and quantum information processing ,",
    "it is desirable to extend the approach to multi - qubit systems . in this context",
    ", the lr invariant approach for ultrafast quantum state transfer between two @xmath8-type atoms based on cqed system has just been studied in @xcite .    in this paper , we present an alternative nonadiabatic proposal to speed up the population transfer and the creation of maximal entanglement between two atoms inside a cavity in the spirit of berry s transitionless quantum driving approach .",
    "different from the previous schemes @xcite where the cdd hamiltonian derived from the original reference hamiltonian can be realized experimentally in terms of a time - dependent magnetic field between two levels of a single atom , in our system with two atoms in a common cavity the reverse engineered cdd hamiltonian does not readily available within the model under consideration . to circumvent this ,",
    "we take into account one more auxiliary excited level for each atom , an extra external laser field and an extra cavity field mode to experimentally realize our shortcut schemes to adiabatic passage and construct the auxiliary interaction hamiltonian that provides us with the extra shortcut interaction .",
    "though the extra shortcut interaction derived from the reference hamiltonian can speed up the population transfer and the rate of maximally entangled state creation , the perfect shortcut performance is slightly deteriorated since the derivation of the auxiliary effective hamiltonian is based on the large detuning condition .",
    "still , our extra shortcut interaction can considerably accelerate the slow adiabatic passage and the performance based on it is robust , thus promising to be realized experimentally .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical model for two @xmath0-type atoms embedded in a single - mode cavity . in sec .",
    "iii , we construct a shortcut passage for population transfer between two atoms . in sec .",
    "iv , the shortcut for generating maximal entanglement between two atoms is achieved . in sec .",
    "iv , the influences of decoherence on the shortcut for population transfer and maximal entanglement generation are considered .",
    "the conclusion part appears in sec .",

    "if the initial state is @xmath31 with @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 and @xmath36    we assume @xmath37 in this paper for simplicity .",
    "for our purposes we also assume the weak - driving fields specified by @xmath38 this assumption neglects the probability of populating state @xmath39 during the entire process of evolution .",

    "note that the eigenstate @xmath51 with zero eigenvalue @xmath52 is a dark state .    here",
    ", starting from the atomic state @xmath53 we are concerned with two problems .",
    "the first problem is how to transfer population simultaneously in the two atoms : @xmath54 and @xmath55 or , in other words , how to drive the two atoms from the initial state @xmath56 to the target state @xmath57 the second problem is how to create maximum entanglement between the two atoms .",
    "as is well known , the adiabatic passage method does well with these problems .",
    "namely , when the adiabatic condition @xcite @xmath58 with @xmath59 is satisfied , state @xmath60 would follow @xmath51 closely . then , by judiciously tailoring the classical fields @xmath61 and @xmath23 either of the two above - mentioned problems can be solved successfully .",
    "although the adiabatic passage method is one - step implementation , it usually takes quite a long time that is undesirable .",
    "if one attempts to quicken the process a little bit , the adiabatic following condition may be violated and transition to states other than @xmath62 may happen leading to a wrong ( unintended ) final state .    in the next sections we shall consider fast and robust shortcuts to adiabaticity for the two above problems .",
    "as the instantaneous eigenstates @xmath63 eqs .",

    "we look for a hamiltonian @xmath6 that is related to the original hamiltonian @xmath2 but drives the eigenstates @xmath68 exactly , i.e. , @xmath69    according to berry s general transitionless tracking algorithm @xcite , one can reverse engineer @xmath6 from @xmath7 the algorithm results in infinitely many such hamiltonians @xmath6 which differ from each other only by phases . disregarding the effect of phases ,",
    "the simplest hamiltonian @xmath70 that exactly drives the set of instantaneous eigenstates of @xmath2 is derived in the form @xmath71 the addition of @xmath2 to @xmath70 ( i.e. , @xmath72 only affects the phases of the system evolution .",
    "being interested only in populations , we can exclude @xmath2 ( i.e. , @xmath73 .",
    "putting eqs .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) - ( [ e12 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ e13 ] ) , we obtain , after differentiating each of the @xmath41 and then summing up all the five terms , the following expression for @xmath74@xmath75 where @xmath76    we remark , however , that for two @xmath0-type atoms in real experiment , the cdd hamiltonian @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) does not exist .",
    "therefore , we shall find an alternative physically feasible hamiltonian which is equivalent to @xmath77 generally , the physical realization of such hamiltonians is case - dependent .",
    "for example , in chen s scheme @xcite for nonadiabatic speeding up the population transfer in two- and three - level systems of a single atom , an auxiliary laser or microwave interactions are involved to directly drive two internal levels of the atom . here",
    "we take into account an auxiliary excited level @xmath78 additional classical driving fields @xmath16 and an extra cavity field mode to realize an equivalent - to - the - cdd hamiltonian that indirectly drives the two interested states @xmath79 and @xmath80 as shown by dashed bars and dashed arrows in fig .",
    "the transition @xmath81 is dispersively coupled to the auxiliary cavity mode with a real coupling constant @xmath82 and a detuning @xmath83 , while @xmath11 is nonresonantly coupled to @xmath15 by a laser field with a rabi frequency @xmath84 and a detuning @xmath85 . under the rwa ,",
    "the auxiliary interaction hamiltonian is @xmath86 @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the creation operation for the auxiliary cavity mode .",
    "we assume @xmath89 and @xmath90 in this paper for simplicity .",
    "let the system be initially in state @xmath91 in the large detuning regime @xmath92 and @xmath93 the atoms can mutually exchange energy in such a way that the level @xmath94 and the auxiliary cavity field mode @xmath18 are only virtually excited @xcite .",
    "then @xmath95 can effectively be described by the hamiltonian @xmath96 where @xmath97and @xmath98 with @xmath99 the effective hamiltonian ( [ e17 ] ) is equivalent with the cdd hamiltonian @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ e14 ] ) when @xmath100 hence , the rabi frequency of the auxiliary laser field that generates a hamiltonian equivalent to the cdd hamiltonian can be determined from the original frequencies @xmath61 and @xmath101 as @xmath102 we remark that , compared to the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will prepare the maximal entanglement in the ground states of two atoms , which is robust against the atomic spontaneous emission . moreover , different from the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite , the auxiliary hamiltonian ( [ e17 ] ) can serve as a supplement or function independently for our time - dependent cdd hamiltonian .",
    "when the auxiliary hamiltonian functions independently , our system reduces to the interaction between two simple three - level atomic systems and a field mode which could be realized with the current cavity qed technology .",
    "thus , based on the cdd hamiltonian ( [ e17 ] ) , our proposals for fast population transfer and creation of two - atom maximal entanglement are not sensitive to fluctuations of the experiment parameters . especially , there is no need to precisely control the operation time in our present scheme .",
    "we now demonstrate that the simultaneous population transfer @xmath103 in the two atoms governed by * *  @xmath95 * * is much speeded up as compared to the adiabatic passage governed by @xmath7 let the rabi frequencies @xmath104 and @xmath101 in the original hamiltonian @xmath2 depend on time as @xmath105 $ & for $ \\tau \\leq t\\leq t+\\tau $ \\\\ $ 0 $ & otherwise \\end{tabular } \\right .",

    "3 , where populations @xmath115 with @xmath116 being the density matrix associated with the governing hamiltonian , are plotted versus @xmath117 for a given operation duration .",
