    "similar structure can be observed at the @xmath4 point .    at the @xmath7 point",
    ", we also observe the unique properties .",
    "the energy splitting on the @xmath7 points are given by @xmath195 ( unique ) at the @xmath169 or @xmath170 point and @xmath196 ( triply degenerate ) at the @xmath173 point .",
    "the @xmath169 and @xmath170 points are described by the conjugate pair of the one - dimensional complex @xmath197 and @xmath198 representations . on the other hand , the @xmath173 point is described by the @xmath174 representation and would be described by the @xmath2 weyl point .",
    "incidentally , we observe several contact points with accidental degeneracy at general @xmath22 points , e.g. , along the @xmath3-@xmath7 and @xmath3-@xmath199 lines .",
    "analyses of physical quantities on this system are desired for future work .",
    "in summary , we have examined the energy dispersion of the @xmath1 crystal in detail .",
    "the tight - binding model has been derived explicitly where we show the emergence of the pseudospin @xmath2 and @xmath6 dirac cones .",
    "we have also analyzed the effect of soc to examine how the degeneracies at the dirac points are lifted .",
    "in contrast to the other strongly - isotropic honeycomb and diamond crystals , the @xmath1 crystal lacks the inversion symmetry , and the lowering of the symmetry is quite peculiar .",
    "we found that , by including the soc , the @xmath2 dirac point split into the @xmath11 weyl point with the four - dimensional @xmath10 representation and the @xmath6 weyl point with the two - dimensional @xmath9 representation .    here",
    "we note the magnitude of the soc in the @xmath1 carbon system . in the sec .",
    "[ sec : soc ] , we have analyzed the soc based on the tight - binding model . it is well known that the soc is small in the carbon system because of the light atom .",
    "we have performed the first - principles calculation to the @xmath1 carbon system , including the soc .",
    "we have verified that the energy splitting given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] can be reproduced from the first - principles calculation , but the energy splitting of the six - fold degeneracy at the @xmath4 point is small @xmath200 10 mev . as has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the replacement of carbon atoms with heavier atoms enlarges the the energy splitting .",
    "further physical and chemical analyses are necessary for the realization of @xmath11 weyl semimetal in the @xmath1 crystal , i.e. , for clarifying the conditions that the @xmath11 weyl point emerges at the fermi energy without the other fermi surfaces .",
    "finally we briefly discuss the relevance of the present analysis to the recently - synthesized @xmath1 crystal . the first success in synthesizing the @xmath1 crystal was achieved @xcite , where the constituting component is a molecule ( called the ndi-@xmath201 ) , instead of the carbon atom . in this material ,",
    "the frontier molecular orbitals are extended along the neighboring molecules , i.e. , the inter - molecular overlapping is of the @xmath82 type . in addition , the long distance hoppings are not relevant since the distance between the next - nearest - neighbor molecules is large ( @xmath202  ) .",
    "thus the dispersive band structure is similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) .",
    "in addition , the filling factor @xmath203 for the ndi-@xmath201 system , was evaluated as @xmath204 @xcite , which is close to @xmath205 .",
    "this indicates a possibility that the fermi energy lies on the @xmath2 dirac point , i.e. , the @xmath2 dirac semimetal . additionally , nontrivial flat bands have been pointed out reflecting the peculiar molecular structure of ndi-@xmath201 @xcite .",
    "further theoretical investigation needed for analyzing the electronic states in the newly - discovered @xmath1 crystal is left for future work .",
