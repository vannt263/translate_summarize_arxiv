    "recent observational data @xcite suggests that dark energy is believed to be responsible for the observed acceleration of the universe @xcite . many theoretical proposals on the nature of dark energy have been put forward .",
    "cosmological constant @xcite is widely accepted as the most promising candidate for dark energy , but there is the problem of its extreme fine - tuning .",
    "there are many alternative approaches which do not contradict with observational data @xcite .",
    "one possible approach is based on the fact that the matter with the equation of state parameter @xmath1 is not ruled out by observational data and moreover necessary to describe the current acceleration of the universe .",
    "phantom @xcite is an alternative form of dark energy with this property and various aspects have been discussed extensively @xcite .    in spite of many theoretical attempts , at present",
    "the nature of the dark energy is still enigmatic .",
    "an alternative approach to dark energy could be to try the `` reverse '' way ; instead of guessing the energy density and then trying to determine the evolution of the universe , one first assumes some specific scale actor @xmath2 , and then fix the energy density from the the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "this type of approach was proposed before in which the focus has been primarily on the description of the present universe starting from the past . in this work",
    ", we will be interested in the future of the universe .",
    "so far , many results of the existing literatures on the future of the universe is based on the consequences of acceleration @xcite .    however , the ignorance of the exact content of the dark energy leaves other choices of the scale factor as viable . in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a particular form of the scale factor which is consistent with the present accelerating universe .",
    "it represents the universe which does not expand forever , but approaches asymptotically a constant value .",
    "the motivation for considering such universe is that there is a priori no reason why the acceleration of the universe should be the final state .",
    "the @xmath3cdm suggests the acceleration as a final stage , but other contents of the dark energy could give different fate of the universe .",
    "for example , in the phantom model the energy density may increase with time and the universe ends up in big - rip singularity @xcite in which the hubble parameter and the curvature diverges in a finite time .",
    "another speculation is that dark energy might dissipate with time and universe contracts in a big - crunch  @xcite as in the cyclic model  @xcite . here , we investigate universe neither accelerating nor decelerating , but becoming asymptotically static with its size approaching a constant value , and ask what type of energy contents will yield such universe . in order to implement the idea",
    ", we consider a generalized quintom model  @xcite which consists of a scalar field and phantom , and also the cold dark matter which satisfies the continuity equation .",
    "the potentials of the scalar fields and other quantities defining the model are not fixed at this stage . with this",
    ", we bring in a scale factor which has the property that it is accelerating at present , but begins to decelerate after a fixed time , and eventually settles down to an asymptotic value .",
    "then , the details of the theory are determined through the evolution equations .",
    "we show that such a scenario is possible due to the balance between the attractive matter and the negative cosmological constant , and the repulsive scalar field and phantom in the asymptotic region .",
    "the stability analysis shows that this asymptotic solution is classically stable .",
    "let us first consider phantom cosmology where gravity is coupled to a scalar field with a scalar coupling function and a potential .",
    "this model was considered before @xcite where the possibility of phantom - non - phantom transition occurs in early time as well as at late time . in this paper , we go one step further and discuss the future of the universe with such a scalar coupling function .",
    "the action is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gravitational coupling , @xmath6 can change continuously , and @xmath7 is the potential . @xmath8 is the matter action which we assume to be a cold dark matter with @xmath0 , and satisfies the continuity equation .",
    "the scalar field @xmath9 is a function of time alone .",
    "the evolution equations are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the hubble parameter , the energy density @xmath12 and the pressure @xmath13 are @xmath14 and the scalar field satisfies @xmath15    there could be many expressions of scale factor which has the desired property of transition from acceleration to deceleration . in this work , we choose a special ansatz of the scale factor as follows ; @xmath16 where @xmath17 are constants , @xmath18 is the current age of the universe , @xmath19 is the asymptotic value , and @xmath20 is arbitrary .",
    "this ansatz shows the behavior that the universe accelerates until some time ( given below ) and then deceleration takes place until it reaches an asymptotic value .",
    "therefore , it does not fit the whole history of the universe , and we assume it is an effective scale factor which describes the universe only after the late - time acceleration has begun , @xmath21 . the transition from acceleration to deceleration will happen at the time @xmath22 satisfying the following conditions : @xmath23{\\frac{n-1}{n b}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the condition that the deceleration must take place at later time restricts @xmath24 .    with this scale factor ,",
    "the hubble parameter is given by @xmath25 and the matter density is given as @xmath26 with the ansatz as in @xcite @xmath27 the einstein equations  ( [ oneeineq ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath28    in order to determine the constant @xmath29 and @xmath30 , we demand @xmath31 then , we get the following two relations @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "the free parameters are given by @xmath34 and @xmath20 ; @xmath34 determined the final size of the universe , and @xmath20 is related with the transition time from acceleration to deceleration .",
    "they can be restricted by the observational data .",
    "the effective equation of state parameter @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 and at the current time we confront the equation of state parameter @xmath35 with experimental uncertainty ( @xmath37 )  @xcite which constrains the parameter @xmath20 and @xmath34 .",
    "the numerical analysis is given in fig .",
    "1 which shows that there exists allowed region within the experimental uncertainty . among the possible values , we choose a point and present numerical result in fig .",
    "the result shows that at current time , the potential is dominant so that the universe is accelerating . also the scalar function @xmath38 is slightly negative and it is in the phantom phase . as it evolves , the deceleration begins to take over as the scalar function @xmath6 ( kinetic energy ) reaches its near peak value .",
    "then , both the potential and the scalar function decrease rapidly and becomes negative .",
    "however , the matter density stays always positive , decreasing as @xmath39 , and asymptotically it cancels exactly with the scalar contributions of the potential and the kinetic energy .",
    "this exact cancelation renders the universe asymptotically static .    in fig .",
    "[ fig02fig03 ] , we plot various quantities for values of @xmath40 .    [ 1 ] parameter space .",
    "the blue shaded region are allowed by experimental uncertainty @xmath37 .",

    "let us check the stability of the ansatz ( [ sola ] ) and ( [ solphi ] ) .",
    "in fact , this model ( with one scalar field ) could be unstable due to several reasons .",
    "the first one is that the effective equation of state parameter diverges , which occur in case of vanishing of denominator in ( [ oneeff ] ) .",
    "the other one is the instability of the solution ( [ sola ] ) and ( [ solphi ] ) due to singularity which occurs when crossing the point of the coefficient of kinetic term @xmath6 becoming zero as discussed in  @xcite . in order to avoid these problems",
    ", we may consider two scalar fields model like @xmath51 where @xmath52 are potential energy for which we assume that there is no direct coupling between @xmath53 field and @xmath54 field , @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 is a cosmological constant . for our purposes ,",
    "we take the value of @xmath56 to be negative .    by varying the action ,",
    "one can obtain the einstein equations and the continuity equation for cdm as follows ; @xmath57 where energy density @xmath58 , @xmath59 and pressure @xmath60 , @xmath61 are given by @xmath62 and equations of scalar fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath63    in the two scalar fields model , we can choose the corresponding coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 to be non - vanishing everywhere .",
    "then the instability due to divergence would not occur .",
    "for example , we may choose that @xmath64 should be always positive and @xmath65 be always negative @xcite , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a non - zero constant .",
    "since @xmath64 and @xmath65 are positively- and negatively - defined , respectively , @xmath64 gives ordinary scalar phase and @xmath65 phantom phase .",
    "the numerical evaluation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig04 ] .",
    "the corresponding potential energy @xmath68 and @xmath69 are obtained by solving the following differential equations that are just the scalar field equations  ( [ twoscaeq ] ) with solution @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72 where the solutions @xmath73 and @xmath74 are generally dependent upon integration constant which can be defined in accordance with the potential energy of the one scalar fields model .",
    "the corresponding effective equation of state parameter @xmath75 and @xmath76 are given by @xmath77 as was mentioned before , the effective equation of state parameter of the one scalar field model becomes singular at some point . in order to obtain the well defined effective equation of state parameter of the two scalar field model , we can choose the integration constant such that denominator in  ( [ twoeffpara ] ) should be always non - vanishing .",
    "this can be done and some numerical result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0506 ]    [ 1 ] and @xmath78 .",

    "one can obtain the equations for the linear perturbations up to the first order as follows : @xmath87 before we carry out the numerical analysis , let us analyze the late time property analytically .",
    "when time @xmath88 becomes very large , the contribution of @xmath89 and @xmath90 will become negligible",
    ". therefore eq.([variation ] ) reduces to @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are values at late time .",
    "the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath94 are given by @xmath95    since @xmath96 is negative(for the positive value @xmath34 ) , there are no positive eigenvalues .",
