    "in the third decade of the last century lotka @xcite and volterra @xcite formulated a coupled set of equations to describe an auto catalytic model and the statistics of fish catches in adriatic . since then lotka volterra model has become a central area of interest for periodic oscillations in nonlinear systems with competitive elements @xcite .",
    "it has found its applications in population biology @xcite , ecology @xcite , mathematical biology @xcite .",
    "nevertheless it has often been criticized for being biologically unrealistic and mathematically unstable .",
    "plenty of modifications were made to make it more realistic . yet in last two decades area of application of lotka - volterra model",
    "it has made its way through newly explored applications , from membrane dynamics of competing neurons @xcite , neural networks @xcite , metabolic algorithm @xcite to network - electronics @xcite and stochastic dynamics @xcite .",
    "with this re - emergence of lotka - volterra dynamics , we study some unexplored aspect of the original model . + lotka - volterra dynamics describes a predator - prey system where the prey thrives on the naturally available resources while predator thrives only on its interaction with the prey and would be extinct in a non interacting system .",
    "it is easy to realize that in such a system the prey population would thrive of the predators decrease while an increase in the predator number would cause the prey population to diminish .",
    "the predator can not flourish for ever because a decreasing number of prey would lead to fewer interaction and would drive the predator towards extinction .",
    "this produces the limit cycle like oscillations .",
    "the lotka volterra limit cycle is however very different from the usual limit cycles in that it depends on the initial conditions .",
    "this makes lotka volterra dynamics interesting .",
    "the unbounded growth of the prey population in the absence of the predator depends on a constant source of nutrients . in any practical situation",
    ", there will be some periodic fluctuations in the nutrients because of natural causes .",
    "if it is a wolf - rabbit situation , then the rabbit s supply of grass will have a seasonal variation .",
    "interestingly enough , the periodic variation in the growth rate of the prey has not been studied in literature",
    ". there has been study of random variation @xcite but not periodic ones . in this work ,",
    "we study the effect of periodic variations . in carrying out this analysis",
    ", we noticed that the standard techniques that are used in dealing with nonlinear oscillators ( poincare lindstedt method @xcite , equivalent linearization @xcite have not been carried out for the lotka volterra model . accordingly in section 2 .",
    "we apply the lindstedt poincare technique on the lotka volterra model and come up with an initial condition dependent oscillation period .",
    "our analytic and numerical results agree . in section 3 ,",
    "we use the analytic tools of section 2 to study the dynamics of the modulated system and also carry out a numerical analysis to test our predictions . since theunmodulated system shows an initial condition dependent limit cycle , the final state of the driven system is found to be initial condition dependent . in section 4 , we apply another specified technique which work for high frequency perturbation and show how the calculation numerics compare favourably .",
    "a brief conclusion is presented in section 5 .",
    "in this section , we focus on the limit cycle of the lotka- volterra model . as is well known , this limit cycle is unusual in the sense that it depends on the initial conditions .",
    "we show how the poincare - linstedt technique can be applied to the model to obtain an initial condition dependent frequency for the limit cycle .",
    "this calculation is valid for small amplitudes and our numerical calculation supports the validity of this result .",
    "+ we take the simplest form of two species lotka - volterra system ; @xmath0 according to a linear stability analysis , the fixed point at ( 1,1 ) is a center .",
    "we first transform eq([eq1 ] ) to the variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 to write , @xmath3 we note immediately that if we drop the nonlinear terms , then we have a simple harmonic oscillator of frequency unity .",
    "we are now in a position to carry out a poincare - linstedt analysis .",
    "we imagine the existence of a parameter @xmath4 multiplying the non - linear terms in eq([eq3 ] ) and introducing the frequency @xmath5 of the full dynamics , rewrite eq([eq2])in the form ; @xmath6 for @xmath71 we expand @xmath8 the right hand side of eq([eq4 ] ) has term of order @xmath4 and higher . at order unity ,",
    "the solution is @xmath9 , @xmath10 , where a is the amplitude of motion . at @xmath11 ) , we have @xmath12 the solvability condition for an inhomogeneous second order differential equation now leads to @xmath13 .",
    "the solution for @xmath14 and @xmath15 is found to be @xmath16 at@xmath17 @xmath18 the solvability condition requires that the @xmath19 part of the right hand side be orthogonal to the left eigenvector of l. this leads to @xmath20 the perturbative result for @xmath5 up to @xmath17 , after setting @xmath21 is @xmath22 where a is the amplitude of the limit cycle . if @xmath23 and @xmath24 be the initial values of x and y , then we can write @xmath25 we have checked this result numerically .",
    "the result are shown in fig[[fig1 ] ] .",
    "the good agreement between the computed frequencies and the obtained from eq([eq10 ] ) is apparent .    ) of its oscillation . ]",
    "with the help of the amplitude dependent frequency of the previous section , we explored lotka - volterra population dynamics under external drive .",
    "these systems have been extensively studied under effect of random perturbation @xcite whereas under periodic forcing they were studied much less @xcite .",
    "we explored it in presence of periodic perturbation .",
    "periodic perturbation leads to diurnal or annual influences on the predator - prey systems and leads to periodic intrinsic growth rate in the prey population . + under periodic forcing , the system [ eq([eq1 ] ) ] becomes @xmath26 shifting to the ( @xmath27 ) variables , we have @xmath28 we note that if @xmath29 then the solutions can be written as periodic trajectories around ( 1,1 ) with a frequency that is dependent on the initial conditions .",
    "for @xmath29 we have equivalent oscillator @xmath30 with @xmath5 given by eq([eq10 ] ) . in this technique of equivalent linearisation eq([eq33 ] ) can be rewritten as ; @xmath31 eliminating @xmath32 we have @xmath33 defining @xmath34 then , @xmath35 when the driving amplitude is small,(@xmath36 ) @xmath37 using the transformation @xmath38 , we arrive at @xmath39 correct to @xmath40(@xmath41 ) .",
    "we recognize eq([eq38 ] ) as a mathieu equation and note that there will be a periodic response at a frequency of @xmath42 provided we fulfill the condition @xmath43 this is in effect a construct on the initial conditions .",
    "the result found in eq([eq39 ] ) implies that for every modulating frequency @xmath44 , there will be some initial conditions for which a periodic response will be possible .",
    "for initial conditions in the range @xmath45 , the response will be unbounded while for initial conditions outside this range the response will be bounded and in general quasi - periodic - the periodic motion resulting when eq([eq39 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "+ in fig[[fig2 ] ] , the unboundedness of the solution is shown for @xmath46 .",
    "the width of the unbounded region is exactly @xmath47 .",
    "the original set of equation have nonlinear terms that prevents the dynamics becoming unbounded .",
    "nevertheless we get the signature of unboundedness through the steep increase of the width ( @xmath48 ) fig[[fig3 ] ] of the phase space trajectory in the same frequency range .    )",
    "shows the signature of unboundedness of the linearized solution.fig([fig3 ] ) change of width ( @xmath48 ) ( a , b ) reflects the resonance in linearized rezime . as we move from linearized unbounded solutions @xmath48 decreases ( c , d ) .",
    "solid lines ( a , c ) represent the unperturbed trajctories . ]    [ fig2 ]    ) ] campares well with the signature of resonance in original dynamics ( b ) . in ( b ) @xmath48 is plotted with initial conditions of population density ( @xmath49 ) . ]",
    "@xmath48 is potentially very different from the width @xmath50 we discussed later .",
    "@xmath48 is a effect of the dynamics of two competing frequencies having resonating effect at comparable values , whereas @xmath50 shows the presence of two different order of timescale .",
    "in this section , we consider the variation in the parameter of the lotka volterra model to be very rapid , i.e. the period @xmath44 of the forcing in eq([eq41 ] ) , is much greater than the frequency of the unforced system .",
    "the system fluctuates rapidly from the unperturbed trajectory and the phase space trajectory is broadened fig[[fig4 ] ] .",
    "this broadening ( @xmath50 ) depends mainly on the frequency of forcing and feebly on forcing amplitude . as @xmath44 increases this broadening decreases very rapidly .    ) of high frequency perturbation changes as we vary frequency of perturbation ( @xmath44 ) from 10 ( a ) to 30 ( b ) .",
    "phase space plots ( b , d ) also show these through its change of width .",
    "the solid lines represent the unperturbed trajectory . ]",
    "the analysis of the system follows a procedure explained by landau and lifshitz .",
    "we split the variables @xmath51 and @xmath32 into two parts , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 carry the rapid variations ( scale of @xmath44 ) and the averaged quantities @xmath55 and @xmath56 carry the slow variation ( order unity ) of the original model . substituting in eq([eq41 ] ) ; @xmath57 in this section , we do not restrict @xmath41 to be small . instead , we note that since @xmath58 , typically @xmath59 .",
    "we choose the dynamics of @xmath60 to be @xmath61 in the above @xmath55 and @xmath56 may be treated as constants on the scale of variation over a period @xmath62 .",
    "in that situation , eqs([eq44 ] ) and ( [ eq45 ] ) reduce to @xmath63 since @xmath64 , we write the approximate solution of eq([eq46 ] ) as @xmath65 we now average eqs([eq42 ] ) and ( [ eq43 ] ) over the fast variations , drop terms that are @xmath66 and obtain @xmath67 which is the unforced system in the coarse - grained variables .",
    "the picture , which emerges is as follows : under a high frequency modulation , the motion can be explained as a rapidly oscillatory motion which is virtually identical to the trajectory of the unforced system .",
    "the amplitude of the fast variations decays according to @xmath68 as shown in eq([eq47 ] ) .",
    "numerical simulation of the system bears out these expectations.fig[[fig5 ] ]     is plotted against the frequency of modulation ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the fitting function ( f(x ) ) supports the form of analytical result . ]",
    "in this paper we have shown that under lotka - volterra dynamics populations of predator and prey depend on their initial population densities .",
    "this dependence of initial population brings forth changes in dynamics but helps us formulate an effective mathew - hill type equation for this 2-species system under periodic seasonal changes .",
    "this also indicates slow seasonal changes have more effects in the variation of population than its faster counterpart .",
