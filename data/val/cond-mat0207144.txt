    "many studies have been devoted to finding analytic solutions of more realistic models than the sherrington - kirkpatrick one .",
    "the diluted spin glass models belong to this class , and they are characterized by a finite coordination number ; these models are also interesting because they are connected with different optimization problems @xcite .    in the present work we consider lattices where each site is connected with a finite number of randomly chosen sites",
    "; we study both the cases where the connectivity is fixed and where the connectivity is a poissonian variable with given mean value .",
    "the spin interaction is only among nearest neighbour pairs .",
    "the random structure of these lattices allows us to neglect the probability of closed paths of finite length : this probability becomes indeed zero in the thermodynamic limit : the correlations among the neighbours of a given spin can be neglected .",
    "we are therefore dealing with mean field models , although the difficulties due to the finite connectivity do nt allow us to solve them exactly .",
    "whereas in the sk model only the overlap between two replicas occurs as order parameter ( the order parameter is a function in the infinite step replica symmetry breaking solution and a pure number when the replica symmetry is exact ) , in the finite connectivity models the order parameter becomes a function of the overlaps of any number of replicas and then it becomes a function of an infinite number of variables when the symmetry is totally broken ; as a result it is extremely difficult to find the exact free energy @xcite .",
    "in other words the probability distribution of the effective cavity fields is gaussian in the sk model as a consequence of the central limit theorem , so it can be characterized by its variance . when the number of neighbours @xmath0 is finite , this distribution is no more gaussian and all the moments are relevant and this leads to the presence of an infinite numbers of order parameters ( also in the replica symmetric situation ) .",
    "perturbative solutions have been investigated both near the critical temperature @xcite and near the infinite connectivity point ( sk model ) @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently it has been proposed proposed a general non perturbative solution developing the bethe - peierls cavity method to an approximation that is equivalent to a one step replica symmetry breaking level @xcite .",
    "the present work addresses to the study of the large connectivity expansion : we compute the first order of the expansion in the inverse power of the connectivity ( @xmath0 ) for the free energy .",
    "the @xmath1 expansion has been studied for the fixed connectivity model by goldschmidt and de dominicis , at the first step of replica symmetry breaking @xcite ; they found results that exhibit a low temperature divergence for the first order correction in @xmath1 to the free energy density .",
    "the @xmath2 expansion , that they computed a @xmath3 and to the second step of replica symmetry breaking , has finite corrections both at the first and the second order @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 coefficient becomes yet smaller by a factor ten and by a factor three when one goes from the replica symmetric solution to the 1rsb one and from this to the 2rsb one respectively .    in this paper",
    "we have computed the coefficient of the @xmath1 expansion up to the second step of replica symmetry breaking . for the replica symmetric and",
    "the 1rsb solutions our results agree with those found by goldschmidt and de dominicis .",
    "these results suggest that the pathological behaviour ( i.e. the low temperature divergence ) is a consequence of the fact that one stops the computation at a finite step of the iterative process for breaking the replica symmetry .",
    "our results indicate that the @xmath1 expansion is well defined and can be used also in the zero temperature limit .",
    "we notice that a well defined @xmath1 expansion is possible for a model with continuos varying coupling only if ( irrespective of the sign ) the zero temperature entropy is zero in the limit @xmath4 .",
    "indeed it is easy to prove using the approach of @xcite that in the mean field approximation for finite @xmath0 the zero temperature entropy is identically zero , so that the two limits @xmath4 and @xmath5 could not be exchanged in an hypothetical model with continuos coupling if the zero temperature entropy were different from zero at @xmath6 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the second section we present the two models we study and the high connectivity expansion is obtained .",
    "we use a simple method to evaluate sums over multiple replicas overlaps . in the third section",
    "we show how to perform sums over the replica indices in a simple way and in section four we illustrate our numerical results for the two steps replica symmetry breaking and we compare them with the known ones at the first step of replica symmetry breaking .",
    "finally we present our conclusions .",
    "the appendix is devoted to a consistency check for the form of the free energy we use .",
    "by definition a bethe lattice is a lattice where the bethe - peierls approximation is exact ; this is equivalent to saying that there are no finite size loops .    in the random lattices we study",
    "the typical length of a loop is proportional to @xmath7 : in the infinite volume limit it is therefore a bethe lattice .",
    "this is locally equivalent to a tree - like structure , nevertheless by defining the bethe lattice as a random lattice one bypasses the problem of fixing the boundary conditions to introduce frustration ( this is provided by the loops of size @xmath8 ) .",
    "we therefore follow a variational formulation using in the framework of the replica approach the same scheme @xcite .",
    "we define a functional and we show that the free energy is obtained as the stationary point with respect to an order parameter that will be defined .",

    "our goal is to make stationary the functional @xmath17 with respect to the variation of @xmath15 .",

    "the correctness of this functional ( [ funz ] ) has been proved by de dominicis et al .",
    "@xcite ; a simple way to get this result is reported for completeness in the appendix .    in order to write the order parameter @xmath15 in a more explicit form ( where the multiple overlaps appear ) we generalize the identity @xmath25 to @xmath26 where the last sum is over all possible sets of @xmath27 replicas , counting once any permutation .",
