    "their long - range order can then be investigated in a purely tiling framework , being determined by the `` tile hamiltonian''@xcite ) , which assigns to every tiling the corresponding structural energy .    despite years of study ,",
    "there remain two plausible , competing scenarios that predict quasicrystal long - range order ( in the sense that _ both _",
    "predict bragg peaks in dimension @xmath4 . )",
    "the `` ideal tiling '' scenario postulates that the tile hamiltonian enforces an essentially unique , perfectly quasiperiodic ground state analogous to a perfect crystal ( just as matching rules or covering rules  @xcite enforce a penrose tiling ) .",
    "alternatively , the ( equilibrium ) `` random tiling '' scenario supposes an ensemble of many _ nearly _ degenerate packings of the structural units .",
    "then the true ground state is normally a coexistence of crystal phases , but at higher temperatures the random - tiling quasicrystal becomes thermodynamically stable owing to its larger entropy ( see references cited in ) .",
    "the two scenarios may be distinguished experimentally by their diffuse scattering . in the random - tiling case ,",
    "every bragg peak is surrounded by wings of diffuse scattering with distinctive shapes predicted by the `` phason '' elastic theory  @xcite .",

    "our motives are ( 1 ) to infer the phason elastic constants of the cct , which is difficult to simulate directly , and ( 2 ) to observe the crossover with decreasing temperature @xmath5 as clusters of small ( rhombohedral ) tiles get bound together into larger ( cct ) `` supertiles '' in a toy model .",

    "@xcite    the 3dpt contains a special subset of vertices , called `` 12-fold '' nodes , at which rhombohedron edges emanate in all 12 of the five - fold symmetry directions  @xcite .",
    "this 12-fold network approximates the cct , since the separation of nearby nodes is usually a @xmath11 or @xmath12 linkage ; however a `` short '' separation of @xmath9 ( along 5-fold axes ) occurs rarely . for our simulations , we adopted the hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the total number of 12-fold nodes , and @xmath19 is the number of `` short '' node pairs with separation @xmath9 .",
    "the purpose of @xmath20 is to suppress `` short '' pairs ; @xmath21 suffices , which we adopted after testing other values . we conjecture ( and simulations support ) that the ground states of ( [ eq - ham12 ] ) are a subset of cct s , namely those with maximum node density , and not the maximum - entropy random cct .",

    "@xcite at high @xmath5 or large wavevector , a linear dependence on @xmath91 is visible , with the slope increasing as @xmath13 .",
    "we attribute this to our use of the 3dpt vertices in ( [ eq - thvert ] ) : the @xmath35 differences between adjacent vertices ( separated by @xmath9 ) certainly exceed the fluctuations of the smooth @xmath34 surface , extrapolated to this short scale .",
    "consequently , the inferred elastic constant is spuriously small .    on the other hand ,",
    "a second regime is visible at low @xmath5 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93 defines a crossover . in this regime",
    ", @xmath94 has a clear linear dependence , which we tentatively attribute to higher - order - gradient terms of @xmath95 in the harmonic phason - elastic coefficients ( [ eq - kquad ] ) , which are permitted by symmetry .",
    "although it certainly affects the @xmath96 wavevector shells at the lowest temperatures , lack of equilibration can not explain all of the low @xmath5/small @xmath77 regime , as the data ( in this regime ) agree very well with our lattice - gas simulations  @xcite which have a different dynamics .",
    "we used the empirical fitting form @xmath97 to extrapolate @xmath78 and @xmath79 to @xmath98 .",
    "our principal result is the temperature dependence of the elastic constants indicated on fig .",
    "[ fig - k1k2 ] . at infinite temperature , i.e. for the maximally random tiling , we fit @xmath99 and @xmath100 , so @xmath101 in agreement with previous measurements on the same ensemble  @xcite . as temperature decreases , @xmath39 increases , as expected since the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham12 ] ) favors formation of `` supertiles '' which have small perp - space differences among their corner nodes .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath1 turns negative with decreasing temperature , consistent with our knowledge that the random cct@xcite has @xmath102 .",

    "our lattice - gas simulations@xcite gave similar results .",
    "approaching @xmath14 , the fit of our data to the angular dependence of elastic theory may be worsening .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1 seems to be approaching the critical value @xmath106 , at which the system goes unstable to a modulation with @xmath60 and @xmath44 along a 3-fold axis .",
    "this suggests that the true canonical - cell tiling  more precisely the maximum - density subensemble of the cct  might have a more complicated dependence than elastic theory .",
    "this is not unprecedented : exactly that is known to happen in those 10-fold and 12-fold symmetric two - dimensional tilings  @xcite that have extra constraints like the cct .",
    "neutron and x - ray diffraction measurements of diffuse wings around bragg peaks yield @xmath107 for @xmath3-alpdmn  @xcite , agreeing with our result , so @xmath3-alpdmn might be modeled by a cct - like network of microscopic clusters . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath3-alcufe has @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "thus , despite their similar face - centered icosahedral atomic structures , @xmath3-alpdmn and @xmath3-alcufe must be modeled by different tile hamiltonians .",
    "the recent experimental calibration of @xmath3-alpdmn data  @xcite yielded @xmath109 in absolute physical units . multiplying by @xmath110 ( with @xmath111 ) converts this to @xmath112 in the units of this paper , which is puzzlingly small .",
    "this is hard to explain by a misjudgment in our model formulation .",
    "if our tiles are invalid , one expects that ( since this alloy is so well ordered ) , they should be replaced by large supertiles , so that @xmath39 becomes _ larger _ , or that matching rules are satisfied implying @xmath113 . instead",
    ", the data suggest that , implausibly , atoms are free to fluctuate in groups even _ smaller _ than a rhombohedron .    the temperature dependence of @xmath114 was used for extrapolation only ; the hamiltonian ( [ eq - ham12 ] ) simply implements the cct and is unlikely to model a realistic quasicrystal .",
    "a physically relevant model would add to ( [ eq - ham12 ] ) an additional perturbation @xmath115 that breaks the degeneracy among canonical - cell tilings , so that large @xmath115 corresponds to physical low temperature .",
    "such a model can be investigated using the techniques of this paper .    in conclusion",
