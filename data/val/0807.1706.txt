    "the upper transition region ( henceforth , `` tr '' ) - plasma with electron temperatures in the range @xmath1 k , is adequately described by field - aligned thermal conduction down from the corona .",

    "models dominated by field - aligned heat conduction produce too little emission from the lower tr by orders of magnitude , a problem already evident in work by @xcite .",

    "the neutral atoms diffuse into hot regions , radiate away much of the coronal energy , and can reproduce the h and he line intensities .    the problem might be considered by some as solved , in principle .",
    "but there exists the serious and nagging problem of the peculiar spatial relationship between the observed corona , tr and chromosphere @xcite .",
    "feldman and colleagues have since analyzed many observations , concluding that the lower tr is thermally disconnected from the corona ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "yet @xcite declared that `` the above [ i.e. their ] scenario explains why ( as noted by feldman 1983 ) the structure of the transition region is not clearly related to the structures in the corona '' .",
    "that the debate still rages is evidenced by advocates for `` cool loop '' models in which lower tr radiation originates from loops never reaching coronal temperatures and having negligible conduction ( * ? ? ?",

    "i propose a different scenario , prompted by new data and analyses which show that neither cool loops nor field - aligned processes adequately describe the l@xmath0 chromospheric network .",
    "i speculate that other tr lines might also be accounted for .",
    "l@xmath0 network emission , at @xmath8 resolution appears mostly as threads of relatively uniform intensity , of 5 - 10 mm length and 1 mm diameter ( pgv ) .",
    "pgv argued that `` the different appearance the tr has in the quiet sun [ i.e. network ] is suggesting that the bulk of its emission comes from structures other than the footpoints of hot loops '' .",

    "@xcite showed , using magnetic field measurements from kitt peak , that much of the network l@xmath0 emission originates in long spicule - like structures lying along the lowest few mm of magnetic field lines extending into the corona , but that plage emission may correspond to the thin footpoints as suspected by pgv and modeled by fal . even in plages , on sub - arcsecond scales , field - aligned threads of cool plasma ( fibrils , spicules ) ,",

    "imagine an injection of dense neutral material into the tube footpoint by some chromospheric process .",
    "the tube surface acts as a semi - permeable membrane .",
    "neutral particles travel freely between collisions , but ions gyrate about magnetic field lines with gyro radii orders of magnitude smaller than mean free paths ( `` mfp ' 's , table  tab : regimes ) . ions and electrons are essentially frozen to field lines , but neutrals can diffuse across field lines almost as efficiently as along them , and find themselves impacted by hot electrons and protons .",
    "table tab : regimes lists time scales for kinetic processes for a `` cool '' hydrogen atom embedded in a hot corona of @xmath13k , using data from @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* henceforth hlh ) , and @xcite . a hydrogen atom crossing the boundary encounters other diffusing hydrogen atoms and hot protons and electrons .",
    "statistically , the first interaction is a collision with a coronal proton , involving the exchange of energy and ( @xmath14% of the time ) an electron ( charge transfer , `` ct '' ) .",
    "charge transfer yields an exchange of momentum ( 180@xmath15 change in direction ) but little exchange of energy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the kinetic energy exchanged is @xmath16 , shared between them after two such collisions ( i use subscript `` @xmath17 '' to denote hot and `` @xmath18 '' cool plasma ) .",
    "the ct cross section is roughly independent of energy , so the `` warm '' neutral atom has a @xmath19 probability of staying within the hot plasma . assuming that it does so , after @xmath20 s it becomes ionized by impact with a hot electron .",
    "once free , the electron will not readily recombine with a proton ( time scale @xmath21 s ) . at @xmath22k ,",
    "the time @xmath23 needed for electron impact excitation of the @xmath24 levels and ( rapid ) emission of a l@xmath0 photon is comparable to @xmath25 .",
    "thus , of the ionized neutral atoms , @xmath26 will have emitted a l@xmath0 photon , the energy supplied by coronal electrons and protons .",
    "because there are relatively few hot particles , their thermal energy limits the number of neutral atom ionizations and excitations .    from kinetic theory ,",
    "the flux density of neutral hydrogen atoms _ initially _ crossing the boundary into the corona is @xmath27 particles  s@xmath7  @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the kinetic energy per `` hot '' proton is @xmath30 which is shared roughly equally after two ct collisions with a neutral , producing a population of @xmath31 `` warm '' neutrals with @xmath32 .",
    "after a few , say @xmath33 more collisions ( time @xmath34 later ) , all the proton energies are the larger of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 of the @xmath38 neutrals have suffered a proton impact .",
    "( a time of @xmath39 times _ ct@xmath40 @xmath41s is required before all neutrals have been impacted ) .",
    "the warm neutrals relax via collisions with the cool neutrals .",
    "the initial electron evolution is largely determined by inelastic collisions with hydrogen : each hot electron typically has sufficient energy to excite and ionize 5 neutral hydrogen atoms , which takes @xmath42s .",
    "( electron - electron collision times are @xmath43 s ) .",
    "the electrons lose energy @xmath44 per unit volume at the rate @xmath45 leading to a cooling time of @xmath46 s. ( a lower limit applies because tails of the maxwellian distributions can increase excitation / ionization rates ) . of this energy a fraction @xmath47 is emitted in l@xmath0 .",
    "the radial flux density of l@xmath0 radiation from this neutral `` sheath '' is @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the sheath thickness at time @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) , and @xmath52 is the diffusion speed . for a random walk , @xmath53 cm , for warmed neutrals @xmath54 cm ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 km",
    "/ s respectively ; the factor @xmath57 accounts for the random direction of the `` walk '' ) . as a rough estimate , i take @xmath58 km / s : @xmath59 thus , @xmath60 is initially just a fixed fraction of the local coronal energy density multiplied by the diffusion speed .",
    "the specific intensity @xmath61 equals @xmath62 when the line is optically thick and all the radiation scatters away from the solar surface .",
    "( photon mfps for l@xmath0 in the sheath are just @xmath63 cm ) .",
    "this estimate of @xmath61 is a factor of 100 - 300 below measured values of @xmath64 @xmath5ergs@xmath5@xmath6s@xmath65sr@xmath7 in active network threads ( pgv ) and 30 below average network intensities @xcite .",
    "but , as will be made clear below , this is an under - estimate .",
    "similar estimates of intensities for h l@xmath12 and the 584 line of he  i , relative to l@xmath0 , are quite reasonable , recognizing that l@xmath12 is optically thick across the sheath .      to examine the evolution at later times , multi - fluid equations for conservation of mass , momentum and energy were solved as functions of time and distance @xmath66 across the field lines following @xcite and hlh .",
    "just electrons , protons and neutral hydrogen atoms were treated .",
    "cartesian geometry is used because the diffusion region is much thinner than the tube .",
    "i assume that electrons are strongly tied to protons , so that their densities and fluid velocities are equal ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 : charge and electrical currents are neglected ) .",
    "the conservation equations used for mass , momentum and energy density for the fluid of species @xmath69 are    @xmath70    @xmath71    @xmath72    no conservation equation is used for the heat flux since here it is treated as @xmath73 using the mfp approximation . above , @xmath74 is a body force term ( gravity , lorentz force for example ) , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and the @xmath77 are non - linear collisional terms . @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the energy gains and losses respectively , where i adopt @xmath80 erg  @xmath81  s@xmath7 to maintain a chromosphere against losses @xmath79 ( hlh ) , and @xmath79 includes latent heat and l@xmath0 radiative losses computed explicitly from the collisional terms .",
    "the diffusion terms @xmath82 ( not included by hlh , except for the heat flux ) require care especially for the dynamics of the proton fluid . for individual protons and electrons ,",
    "the momentum equations are dominated by the lorentz force .",
    "their cross - field motion on timescales short compared with collision times is circular with frequency @xmath83 . on longer time",
    "scales the summed ( fluid parcel ) momenta can change only after a collision .",
    "the net effect of the lorentz force is thus to limit the cross - field displacement of charged particles to a single gyro radius @xmath84 in collision time @xmath85 instead of the collisional mean free path @xmath86 .",
    "thus , a simple recipe for calculating cross - field transport via the fluid equations is to set both @xmath74 and @xmath87 terms to zero in the proton momentum equation , and modify the @xmath88 terms to account for the reduced displacements .",
    "field - free diffusion is described by equations ( 4.41 ) , ( 4.46 ) and ( 4.52 ) of @xcite : @xmath89 for charged particles , @xmath90 must be replaced by @xmath91 ( following the above argument , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eqs . 4.37 , 4.40 ) ) .",
    "note that , written in terms of @xmath92 , @xmath73 yields the widely used `` spitzer '' thermal conductivity parallel to the field , and the ion - dominated conductivity perpendicular to the field . the net effect for @xmath93",
    "is that only the neutral fluid diffuses efficiently across the field- the charged fluid evolves mostly via the collisional coupling to the neutrals ( via @xmath94 ) , and to a lesser degree to the small @xmath82 terms .",
    "the variables @xmath95 for electrons , protons and neutral h atoms , functions of @xmath96 , were initialized according to table  tab : tube .",
    "only 7 variables were solved since it is assumed that @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the equations were integrated in time using maccormack s method to include the collisional terms @xcite .",
    "for the first three points near @xmath97 , the variables were held fixed to their initial values , maintaining the same chromospheric conditions there .",
    "figure  fig : snapshot shows conditions several seconds after the beginning of the diffusion process .",
    "pressure gradients drive neutrals into the corona against friction forces , thus the diffusion speed , measured by tracking the steep temperature rise , is @xmath98 @xmath5km@xmath5s@xmath7 , far below the thermal speed .",
    "the computed flux density of l@xmath0 is @xmath99 @xmath5ergs@xmath5@xmath6s@xmath7 , and is roughly constant in time .",
    "it is some 10@xmath100 higher than the simple kinetic result above , because of the nonlinear dynamics : ( 1 ) the densities become higher in the corona , ( 2 ) flow energy is converted to heat , ( 3 ) the l@xmath0 losses / latent heat ratio is higher ( the photons are created at electron temperatures lower than the initial coronal temperature ) .",
    "@xmath61 is computed to be just a factor of 10 - 30 below observed active network thread intensities , and 3 below average network intensities .    a calculation with twice the coronal density , more appropriate for active network , yields smaller diffusion speeds and l@xmath0 fluxes which are just 1.7 times higher .",
    "euv / x - ray coronal intensities scale with ( density)@xmath101 , and so would be a factor of four brighter .",
    "this non - linear relationship is an important property of the calculations .",
    "based upon observations of spicules and other fine , thread - like structures on the solar disk , it is clear that non - planar thermal interfaces exist at the base of the corona , and that the morphology of the tr emission from such interfaces can not be explained by field - aligned particle transport at the base of coronal loops , in contrast to the claims by @xcite .",
    "the picture proposed here uses unspecified mechanisms in the chromosphere to maintain a reservoir of cool mostly neutral plasma directly adjacent to hot coronal plasma .",
    "the cylindrical geometry , inspired by observations , presents a large surface area ( per unit volume ) of contact between cool and hot plasma .",
    "the chromosphere supplies mass via neutral diffusion across the surface to a thermal boundary layer , and the corona supplies energy to the neutral particles .",
    "the originally neutral particles drain energy from the corona by latent heat of ionization and by inelastic collisions leading to strong l@xmath0 emission .",
    "the diffusing layer propagates outwards , emitting radiation like the boundary of a wild fire , into the corona until either the supply of neutral mass or coronal energy dries up .",
    "the present proposal is related to models invoking cross - field heat conduction @xcite .",
    "this effect is included here ( via @xmath73 ) , but it is far less efficient at moving heat to cool plasma than diffusion is at moving neutral atoms to the coronal heat .",
    "the calculations presented here fall short of accounting for the large radiative flux of l@xmath0 , by factors of @xmath102 .",
    "however , the calculations miss important additional sources of energy in the corona : thermal and gravitational potential energy .",
    "the cool threads extend only a few mm into the corona , and form just the lower parts of a much larger coronal structure .",
    "the diffused cool material is thus subject to parallel transport ( heat conduction , diffusion ) which will transfer heat from the overlying coronal plasma to the diffused material .",
    "spicules formed by ejection from the chromosphere will have their entire length exposed to this energy flux , because the lowest parts of the spicules diffuse first into the corona- the diffusion fronts are not exactly parallel to field lines .",
    "coronal plasma along connected field lines contains @xmath103 erg  @xmath28 , where @xmath79 is the pressure scale height ( @xmath104 mm ) or loop length . since @xmath11 the energy available for",
    "l@xmath0 radiation would be @xmath105 larger than computed above , more if the tubes expand with height .",
    "i speculate that cross - field diffusion and subsequent parallel conduction _ might bring theoretical and observed intensities values into agreement . _ the time needed to conduct this energy must lie between the electron sound speed @xmath106 as @xmath107 s , and @xmath108 s , an upper limit obtained from the thermal energy divided by the conductive flux for a uniform temperature gradient .",
    "gravitational potential energy might contribute to the heating and dynamics of the sheath as the diffused material cools the corona and adds mass , such that vertical pressure balance no longer is expected .",
    "it may be that larger red - shifts would be expected where magnetic fields are more vertical , i.e. directly over the magnetic network .",
    "this expectation is not in disagreement with results found by @xcite .",
    "however , little more can be said without solving the 2d multi - fluid conservation equations including parallel heat conduction and cross - field diffusion , beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "such calculations will also show if the emission lines of trace species ( ions of carbon , oxygen etc . in the tr ) can be explained .",
    "cool threads are observed in different coronal environments ( pgv)- their intensities appear to vary relatively little compared with the embedding coronal intensities .",
    "this fact is part of feldman s ( 1983 ) claim that tr emission is energetically disconnected from the corona .",
    "the calculations presented here indeed produce a non - linear relationship between l@xmath0 and coronal brightness .",
    "the l@xmath0 intensities scale with the local coronal energy density and with the diffusion speed .",
    "but the euv and x - ray radiation emitted by the corona itself vary with density@xmath101 and peaked functions of temperature along lines of sight different from the direction of field lines into the sheath .",
    "the scenario might therefore explain most of the observed puzzling facets noted by feldman and colleagues , yet still maintain a strong energetic link between the corona and tr , and thereby resolve a long - standing debate ( see the different perspectives of @xcite and @xcite , for example ) .",
