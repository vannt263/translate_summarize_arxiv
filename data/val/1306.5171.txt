    "spinodal decomposition is a non - equilibrium phenomenon occurring in a variety of hard and soft condensed matter systems undergoing first - order phase transitions .",
    "it refers to the spontaneous formation of domains , i.e. spatial symmetry breaking , following a sudden quench into a two - phase region .",
    "examples for hard materials displaying spinodal decomposition are binary alloys , e.g. , fe - cr@xcite where the atoms phase seperate into a two - phase microstructure , or metallic glasses@xcite where the structural properties are intriguing for practical applications@xcite . in soft matter ,",
    "non - trivial phase behaviour may be found , e.g. , in colloidal gels@xcite , glasses@xcite and mixtures@xcite , or in a more general sense in fluids with competing interactions@xcite .",
    "even more complex behavior is observed for particles with internal degrees of freedom such as magnetic particles@xcite and shape - anisotropic particles such as colloidal rods@xcite .",
    "+ theoretically , spinodal decomposition has been intensely investigated over the past decades starting from the generalized diffusion equation suggested by cahn and hilliard ( ch)@xcite . however , since the ch theory is linear in the density perturbations , it focusses only on the early stages of phase separation kinetics@xcite .",
    "spinodal decomposition has later been investigated based on computer simulations@xcite , smoluchowski equation approach@xcite , and dynamical density functional theory ( ddft)@xcite . + in the present paper",
    "we investigate a quasi-2d colloidal fluid mixture , where for one species the soft repulsive interactions between the particles are supplemented by an additional ferromagnetic interaction . a possible experimental realization of soft magnetic particles are complex dusty plasmas@xcite .",
    "by charging paramagnetic dust grains the magnetic interaction between the particles can be superimposed by a ( repulsive ) screened electrostatic interaction .",
    "in contrast to experiments with ( 2d ) magnetic hard spheres@xcite , the `` softness '' of the repulsion may thus be changed by the electrostatic coupling between the grains .",
    "+ following an earlier study by us@xcite , we have considered the first - order demixing transition which is coupled to a ferromagnetic transition . in ref .",
    "we focused on the formation of two - dimensional clusters of a ( globally stable ) phase surrounded by the ( metastable ) bulk phase .",
    "this non - equilibrium pattern formation within the _ metastable _ regions of the phase diagram is also referred to as nucleation.@xcite + in the present study we go one step further and investigate states deep inside the two - phase region far away of the two - phase coexistence ( the binodal ) and from the spinodal ( i.e. the line of points where the barrier for nucleation vanishes ) . inside the spinodal region of the phase diagram density perturbations with certain wavenumbers @xmath5 grow over time _",
    "regardless _ of the amplitude .",
    "this eventually results in a demixing process , that is , spinodal decomposition.@xcite + our investigations are based on ddft@xcite , a generalized diffusion equation where the microscopic interactions enter via the ( helmholtz ) free energy .",
    "recently , ddft has been applied to a variety of phase - separating systems including colloids with critical casimir forces@xcite , colloidal mixtures under gravity@xcite , or even more far - reaching problems such as the growth of cancer cells@xcite .",
    "+ the central dynamic variable within ddft is the time - dependent density field @xmath6 .",
    "however , recent studies show that , based on percus test particle limit@xcite , it is also possible to use the ddft equations to calculate dynamic correlation functions . specifically , one may identify the van hove dynamic correlation function with one - body density distributions of a mixture.@xcite the equivalent function of the dynamic correlation function @xmath7 in momentum space is the dynamic structure factor @xmath8 .",
    "thus , besides calculating the dynamics of the density field one may use ddft to gain more structural information about a phase - separating process . here",

    "+ a similar conclusion regarding the performance of a linear analysis close to the spinodal was reported in a study@xcite based on the nonlinear smoluchowksi equation ( which is closely related to ddft , see ref .  ) .",

    "furthermore , we find that local density - density correlations in the vicinity of the test particle position tend to support the coarsening process during spinodal decomposition : for times up to @xmath195 the interfacial structures are more pronounced as compared to the vineyard system . for very late times",
    "these differences fade , i.e. the average cluster growth @xmath184 for both approaches is similar for @xmath204 .",
