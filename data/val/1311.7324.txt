    "the study of electron cyclotron frequency range em wave propagation in magnetised plasmas has broad relevance , from ionospheric radio wave studies @xcite to heating and current drive @xcite and diagnostics @xcite in magnetically confined fusion plasmas .",
    "while propagation through a homogeneous or slowly - varying monotonic plasma density profile is well understood and can be calculated analytically or using a ray - tracing method , turbulent or otherwise perturbed profiles require detailed numerical modelling using a full - wave method . in order to deal with cases in which the perturbations are 3d in nature ,",
    "a new 3d full - wave code , emit-3d , has been developed to carry out these simulations .",
    "recently , a diagnostic known as sami ( synthetic aperture microwave imaging ) has been developed to take advantage of emission due to mode conversion from electron bernstein waves ( ebws ) @xcite .",
    "this is the inverse of a process which has been investigated as a potential means of heating and current drive in overdense fusion plasmas , such as stellarators @xcite and spherical tokamaks @xcite .",
    "installed on the mast spherical tokamak , the sami diagnostic produces high time - resolution ( @xmath1s ) 2d images of o - mode emission due to ebws generated at ec harmonics in the plasma core .",
    "these are measured in the 10 - 35 ghz range , with each frequency corresponding to a radial position through the plasma edge @xcite .",
    "however , large fluctuations have been observed in the measured signal during inter - elm periods ; these demand explanation .",
    "a candidate explanation for these fluctuations is the influence of inter - elm filaments on the mode conversion and propagation of the emission .",
    "there is evidence for the presence of filamentary blob structures at the edge of nearly all tokamaks , as well as alternative configurations such as stellarators and reversed - field pinches ; they are thought to be responsible for a significant fraction of cross - field transport at the edge of fusion - relevant plasmas @xcite .",
    "they have been observed between elms on mast @xcite , and since their density range has been measured to be @xmath2 m@xmath3 , some filaments will have peak densities close to or above cutoff , particularly at the lower end of the sami frequency range .",
    "this paper quantifies the effect of typical mast inter - elm filaments by varying filament parameters to investigate their interactions with beams .",
    "previous simulations have been carried out to study rf scattering from cylindrical filaments for ion cyclotron resonance heating ( icrh ) and lower hybrid ( lh ) applications using a full - wave method @xcite , and spherical blobs for ec and lh waves , using fokker - planck and ray - tracing methods @xcite , geometric optics analysis @xcite and full - wave modelling @xcite . since emission can be obliquely incident with a finite width along the filament axis , this scattering problem is in some respects inherently 3d .",
    "the new code is therefore used to carry out these simulations in 3d . by comparison with the 2d full - wave code ipf - fdmc @xcite ,",
    "the cases in which 3d treatment is required are determined .",
    "the finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) method is used as the basis for this code .",
    "this employs a grid in which field components are staggered both in space and time , allowing the calculation of time - domain solutions to maxwell s equations via a second - order centred - difference approximation @xcite .",
    "fully explicit update equations for electric and magnetic fields are obtained ( @xmath4 is timestep , @xmath5 is spatial step on the cartesian grid .",
    "the ratio @xmath6 is constrained by a courant stability condition .",
    "after bar , superscripts are timestep indices , subscripts are spatial coordinates ) :    @xmath7\\ ] ]    @xmath8 \\\\   & - & \\frac{\\delta t}{\\varepsilon_0}j_x{}|^{n+1}_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j , k}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with equivalent equations for @xmath9 and @xmath10 field components .",
    "for propagation through free space , the current density @xmath11 ; however , it is nonzero in a plasma . in order to calculate @xmath12 , the linearised fluid equation of motion for the electrons",
    "must be solved at each timestep :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the local electron plasma frequency and cyclotron frequency , @xmath16 is the unit vector parallel to the background magnetic field and @xmath17 is the electron collision frequency , set to zero on the main grid of the simulation but nonzero in the boundary regions to damp outgoing waves .",
    "these parameters modify the value of the courant limit .    to obtain discretised solutions to this 3d system of equations , equation  [ eq : fluid ]",
    "is written in matrix form :    @xmath18    where    @xmath19    this has the time - invariant solution :    @xmath20    in this discretisation scheme , @xmath12 is calculated in phase with @xmath21 , i.e.  at @xmath22 , and so a value of @xmath23 at @xmath24 is available .",
    "this is used as a midpoint approximation ( valid for sufficiently small @xmath4 ) to the value of @xmath23 over the interval @xmath25 $ ] , allowing @xmath23 to be removed from the convolution in equation  [ eq : matrixsoln ] .    a simple integration results .",
    "after carrying this out and discretising @xmath26 , we obtain :    @xmath27    matrix exponentials must therefore be evaluated ; inverse laplace transforms were used to do this exactly , since @xmath28 , although lower - order expansions could also be employed .",
    "after some algebraic manipulation , explicit update coefficients for each current density component are obtained , with no storage of old components required after a timestep .",
    "as static backgrounds are assumed over the timescale of a single simulation , these update coefficients can be calculated once at the beginning of a simulation and do not require updating .",
    "data - level parallelisation using mpi is implemented to reduce computation time , which can be quite significant : 3000 timesteps on a @xmath29 grid take approximately 7 hours on 80 cpu cores .",
    "a benchmarking test of the code is its ability to reproduce the analytic dispersion relations for the o- ( ordinary ) and x- ( extraordinary ) modes observed in a magnetised plasma . very close agreement is observed for both ; x - mode plotted in fig .",

    "it is therefore shown that filamentary plasma structures can have a significant influence on the propagation of microwaves across a broad frequency spectrum , with consequences for both electron cyclotron diagnostics and heating .",
