    "it is a curious but well known fact that field b - stars rotate slower than cluster b - stars @xcite , but the explanation for the difference is still controversial .",
    "one possible solution is that field b - stars represent a population that contains more evolved stars than cluster b - stars do .",
    "they appear to rotate slower because stars generally spin down as they evolve @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite and @xcite suggest that difference in rotation rates between field and cluster b - stars is mainly due to the difference between the initial conditions of the stellar forming regions .",
    "the denser the environment ( such as in young open clusters ) , the more rapid rotators can form .",
    "the second explanation brings more attention to the possible connection between stellar rotation and the physical mechanisms playing a role during the star formation stage .",
    "a plausible higher accretion rate around a forming star in a denser region may lead to a higher initial angular momentum and a shorter accretion disk lifetime with its associated spin - down effects via magnetic interactions between the star and the disk .    because both the evolutionary status of stars and the initial conditions of their forming regions may influence their rotation rates , knowing the evolutionary status of these stars precisely becomes a prerequisite for the solution of this puzzle . with this in mind",
    ", we made a spectroscopic investigation of 108 field b - stars using the same methods that we applied in our previous cluster b - star survey @xcite .",
    "there are two advantages over previous studies of this topic : 1 ) because we apply identical spectroscopic methods to both the field and cluster samples , the influence of any imperfection in our methods on the final comparisons will be reduced to a minimum ; 2 ) we use the estimated @xmath3 as an indicator of stellar evolutionary status , which is more accurate and reliable for large numbers of stars with diverse masses and rotation rates .",
    "we describe our derivation of the key stellar parameters of a field sample of b - stars in next section .",
    "the results of a comparison between the field sample and the cluster sample are reported in section 3 , and a short discussion and our conclusion are given in section 4 .",
    "our field b - star sample was selected from the noao indo - u.s .",
    "library of coud feed stellar spectra @xcite .",
    "this library contains moderate resolution spectra ( fwhm = @xmath4 ) of 1273 stars that were obtained with the 0.9-m coud feed telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "roughly about 140 b - star spectra are found in this library .",
    "these spectra are comparable in s / n and resolution to those analyzed in our previous cluster b - star survey .",
    "following the exact same procedure that we applied to cluster b - stars @xcite , we obtained the stellar parameters of 108 b stars in our final sample : the projected rotational velocity @xmath0 , the effective temperature @xmath1 , the apparent gravity @xmath2 , and the estimated polar gravity @xmath3 .",
    "these results are summarized in table 1 .",
    "we excluded all double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2 ) from the sample because the derived parameters of these objects are not reliable .",
    "the errors are estimated from the deviations between the observed and model profiles ( see @xcite ) , and inclusion of uncertainties related to the continuum placement may increase these errors by @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath0 values were derived by fitting synthetic model profiles of @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 if the line is too weak ) to the observed profiles , using realistic physical models of rotating stars ( including roche geometry and gravity darkening ) .",
    "the details of this step are described in @xcite .",
    "one concern about the derived @xmath0 values is that we do not know the exact instrumental broadening data of the noao indo - u.s .",
    "library spectra for the investigated region ( 4470 - 4480  ) , and assumed only the lower limit of the given fwhm range , 1  , in the convolution of our synthesized line profiles .",
    "an underestimation of the instrumental broadening can lead to higher derived @xmath0 values . in order to determine and then correct the possible systematic errors caused by the uncertainty in the assumed instrumental broadening",
    ", we also obtained high resolution spectra ( @xmath8 ) of 34 stars in our sample from the elodie archive @xcite . by comparing the @xmath0 values derived from the noao library to those from the elodie library",
    ", we found the best relationship between them can be written as    @xmath9    for the stars in our sample that are not found in the elodie library , we corrected their @xmath0 using eq .",
    "[ eq_vsini_correct ] for @xmath10 km  s@xmath11 , and we set @xmath12 for @xmath13 km  s@xmath11 . the corrected @xmath0 and its numerical fitting error are given in columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) of table  1 .",
    "a comparison of the derived @xmath0 values between our results and those from @xcite is illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the good agreement in the low @xmath0 region indicates that our corrections to @xmath0 are properly assigned . in the high @xmath0 region ,",
    "our results are systematically greater than the results from @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy is not surprising , considering that our models take the gravity darkening effect into account .",
    "@xcite showed that the @xmath0 derived from fitting the @xmath6 line could be lower by as much as 10 - 20% for a rapid rotator if the strong gravity darkening effect on its surface is ignored .",
    "the most discrepant point in figure  1 is the star hd  172958 .",
    "our @xmath0 measurement of this star ( 167 km  s@xmath11 ) is similar to the measurements by @xcite and @xcite ( 175 km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "the much larger value measured by @xcite , @xmath14 km  s@xmath11 , might result if the star is an unresolved , doubled - line binary that was observed at a time of larger relative doppler shifts , but the star is not a known binary .",
    "the effective temperature and gravity were derived by fitting the h@xmath15 profile ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "the results and the associated numerical fitting errors are listed in columns ( 2 ) to ( 5 ) of table  1 .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , the derived @xmath2 values represent an average of gravity over the visible hemisphere of these rotating stars",
    ". they may not be good indicators of stellar evolutionary status , especially for rapid rotators that have much lower gravity in the equatorial area caused by the strong centrifugal force . following the method described in @xcite",
    ", we made a statistical correction to estimate the polar gravity of each star from its derived @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 , and the resulting polar gravity is listed in column ( 8) of table  1 .",
    "our estimates of @xmath3 are consistent with the available observations . for example , one of our targets is regulus ( hd  87901 ) that was recently resolved by the chara array optical long baseline interferometer @xcite .",
    "models of the spectroscopy and interferometry of this rotationally deformed star lead directly to a polar gravity of @xmath16 , which compares well with the statistical estimate here of @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , we used our derived @xmath3 values with masses estimated from figure  3 to derive radii , luminosities , bolometric corrections , and absolute magnitudes .",
    "we combined these with the observed magnitudes to find distance estimates , and a comparison of the derived distances with those from _",
    "@xcite shows good consistency .",
    "we note for completeness that in a sample of ten stars in common , @xcite find temperatures that are @xmath18 larger and gravities that are @xmath19 dex greater than our values .",
    "while these differences between results from spectral flux and h@xmath15 fitting are interesting , they are insignificant for our purpose of comparing the parameters of the field and cluster b - stars in a consistent manner .",
    "the recent studies @xcite that found that field b - stars appear to rotate slower than cluster b - stars were mainly based on the field sample from @xcite that includes roughly 1100 bright field b - stars selected from the bright star catalogue @xcite .",
    "we note that both this and our own smaller sample of b - stars are not volume - limited but tend to select from the intrinsically brighter members of the population .",
    "furthermore , both samples include some members of nearby ob associations and moving groups , which are not strictly `` field '' objects .",
    "nevertheless , these field samples are similar enough in their sampling of the spectral types , luminosities , and true field star content that we can use both to compare with the cluster star rotational properties .",
    "the abt et al .  field sample ( alg02 ) contains a total of 902 b - stars of classes iii - v , excluding all sb2s , which we use in our statistical analysis below .",
    "our field sample consists of only 108 b - stars , so one might question whether its content and size are sufficient to represent a field star population similar to that of alg02 .",
    "the spectral sub - type distribution of our field sample and of the alg02 sample are very similar ( see table  2 ) .",
    "furthermore , we show in figure  2 that the cumulative distribution functions of projected rotational velocities @xmath0 appear to be the same .",
    "the mean @xmath0 of our field sample is @xmath20 km  s@xmath11 while the mean @xmath0 of the alg02 sample is @xmath21 km  s@xmath11 .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test shows that these two samples have a probability of 0.72 to be drawn from the same parent sample .",
    "thus , we conclude that our limited sample makes a fair representation of the larger field sample of alg02 and of the rotational properties associated with this group of stars .",
    "the cluster b - star sample used for comparison is extracted from our previous survey of b - stars in 19 open clusters @xcite . after removing all o - stars and sb2s ,",
    "432 cluster b - stars remain in this sample , which covers a range of age from 6 to 72 myr ( the average is 12.5 myr ) .",
    "the mean @xmath0 of the cluster sample is @xmath22 km  s@xmath11 , which is definitely higher than the corresponding value of the field sample .",
    "the cumulative curve for the cluster sample is also significantly different from that of the field sample ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the ks probability that our field and cluster samples are drawn from the same parent sample is as low as 0.001 .",
    "the distributions of the field and the cluster b - star samples in the @xmath23 plane are plotted in figure  3 .",
    "we see that along each evolutionary track the field stars are more evenly distributed in @xmath3 than is the case for the cluster stars , which mainly have higher @xmath3 ( near the zams ) .",
    "this indicates that the field b - star sample contains a larger fraction of older stars ( i.e. , with lower @xmath3 ) than found in the cluster b - star sample stars among the young cluster sample may be pre - main sequence stars @xcite . ] . if the stars in the field sample spin down with time in a similar way as those in the cluster sample @xcite , then it is not surprising that the field sample with more older b - stars appears to be rotating slower than the cluster sample .",
    "note that the cluster sample contains relatively more massive stars compared to the field star sample because the cluster targets were typically selected from the brighter , more massive cluster members .",
    "is the larger fraction of older b - stars in the field sample the dominant cause of its apparent slow rotation or do some additional factors , such as the initial conditions and environment , need to be considered ? in order to investigate this , we plot in figure  4 the @xmath0 distributions of both the field and cluster samples against @xmath3 .",
    "figure 4 also illustrates the mean @xmath0 of stars in each bin of 0.2 dex in @xmath3 ( _ solid line _ ) and the associated standard deviation of the mean ( _ shaded area _ ) .",
    "the advantage of using figure  4 is that the evolutionary spin down effect is dramatically revealed as we compare the stellar rotation of the two samples in each @xmath3 bin .",
    "the overall decrease in mean @xmath0 with lower @xmath3 shows clearly that the spin down process exists in both samples . by comparing the mean @xmath0 of corresponding bins",
    ", we found that it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion about which sample rotates faster . at each evolutionary stage ( indicated by @xmath3 ) , the b - stars in these two samples appear to rotate equally fast .",
    "thus , the overall slowness of rotation in the field sample is mainly due to the larger percentage of its content occupying the bins of lower @xmath3 .",
    "note that we are interpreting the line broadening solely in terms of rotation , but @xcite and @xcite find that macroturbulent broadening is also important among the luminous supergiants ( where it may amount to velocities of 20  60 km  s@xmath11 ) .",
    "we have only seven stars in the sample with @xmath24 , and these have measured @xmath0 velocities of 31  59 km  s@xmath11 , i.e. , comparable to the expected macroturbulent velocities .",
    "thus , we regard the @xmath0 values of the stars with low @xmath3 as upper limits , and the trend of declining rotation velocity with lower @xmath3 may actually be steeper than indicated in the low @xmath3 part of figure  4 .",
    "one possible concern about the comparison made above is that many late b - stars in our cluster sample are found to have non - solar helium abundances @xcite .",
    "since the hydrogen abundance will be lower in helium enriched atmospheres , the change in atmospheric opacity may cause a change in the appearance of the h@xmath15 profile that could lead to erroneous derived values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we checked this possibility by measuring the h@xmath15 profile in synthetic model spectra for he - peculiar stars calculated by c.  s.  jeffrey using the _ sterne / spectrum _ lte codes @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in table  3 that lists the fraction of h and he atoms by number and our derived @xmath1 and @xmath2 for three temperature cases .",
    "the three rows in the table give the results for sub - solar he , solar he , and enhanced he , respectively .",
    "ideally , we should recover exactly the assumed model @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the solar he case , but our scheme arrives at temperatures that are somewhat low ( especially at higher @xmath1 ; for the expected values of 16000k/4.0 , we obtain derived values of 15200k/3.95 ) .",
    "we suspect that this systematic difference reflects differences between the lte codes _ sterne / spectrum _ and the lte codes",
    "_ atlas9/synspec _ that we used to develop the h@xmath15 calibration . while these differences are significant , they are not important for our analysis here where we are making a differential comparison between the cluster and field samples using the same method to obtain the stellar parameters",
    ". what is important are the relative changes as the he abundance increases .",
    "we see that he enrichment results in a deeper h@xmath15 profile that is interpreted in our scheme mainly as a decrease in the resulting temperature while changes in the derived gravity are small .",
    "furthermore , we show in figure  5 that we find no evidence of a correlation between he abundance and @xmath25 among the late b stars ( @xmath26 ) in our cluster sample .",
    "thus , any corrections to the gravity that might be applied to the he - peculiar star subset would be too small to change the rotational trends seen in figure  4 .",
    "our findings in previous section seem to support the first explanation mentioned in  1 , i.e. , field b - stars rotate slower statistically because they represent an older population than cluster b - stars .",
    "the projected rotational velocities with each @xmath3 bin ( corresponding to evolutionary state ) appear to be very similar in the field and cluster samples , which suggests that any differences in environmental factors at birth between the field and cluster samples has little influence on their present rotational properties .",
    "this conclusion differs from that of @xcite and @xcite who argue that the stellar number density at formation affects the rotational velocity distribution .",
    "our field sample contains 108 b - stars .",
    "the relatively small sample size precludes an analysis of subsets based on binned mass ranges .",
    "this raises a question : can we use the whole field sample of b - stars , which span a large range of mass and main sequence ( ms ) lifetime , to compare with the cluster sample , and still draw meaningful conclusions ?",
    "the answer is yes , since our method of comparison is based on the estimated polar gravity @xmath3 of individual b - stars . for all subtypes of ms",
    "b - stars , the surface @xmath2 falls in a range between 4.2  4.3 ( for the zero - age main sequence , zams ) to 3.4  3.6 ( for the terminal - age main sequence , tams ) , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the evolutionary spin down of a ms b - star is mainly due to the evolutionary increase of its moment of inertia ( and stellar radius ) and/or stellar wind mass loss . however , compared to the more massive o - stars , the stellar winds of ms b - stars are generally weak , so wind mass loss plays a minor role in spin down . thus , the evolutionary changes in stellar properties , such as stellar radius and moment of inertia , will be the major cause of evolutionary spin down .",
    "these properties are directly related to surface @xmath2 of the star ( or more accurately , @xmath3 for a rotating star ) . in this sense ,",
    "consideration of b - stars binned in groups of similar @xmath3 is a reasonable means to search for evidence of changes in the mean rotational properties with advancing evolutionary state .",
    "@xcite relied on the strmgren @xmath27 and @xmath28 indices to select their objects in both the field and cluster samples .",
    "we note , however , that estimates of surface gravity derived from fitting the h@xmath15 line profile are generally more reliable than those based upon @xmath27 index , which has a larger intrinsic error ( since @xmath27 measures the difference in magnitude between a narrow band and a wide band centered at h@xmath27 ) .",
    "thus , even though the cluster and field samples were selected from the same area in the @xmath29 plane , they may still contain populations in different evolutionary states ( i.e. , over a greater range in gravity ) . the cluster sample from @xcite is known to be young because it consists of member stars from young open clusters ( h and @xmath30 persei ) while the field sample may include a lot of older stars because its content relies on the @xmath29 selection criterion .",
    "@xcite calculated a grid of synthetic @xmath27 indices applicable to b - stars ( given in table 7 of their paper ) .",
    "the differences in @xmath27 index between zams ( @xmath31 ) and tams ( @xmath32 ) b - stars are only about 0.04  0.05 mag .",
    "since the strmgren data collected by @xcite for the field b - stars came from diverse sources and have errors of 0.01 - 0.02 mag , it is not easy to distinguish between the evolved and unevolved stars based upon the @xmath27 index alone . thus , despite their best efforts to compare the rotational velocities of comparably evolved stars in @xmath33 and @xmath30  per and the field , @xcite probably included a significant fraction of more evolved stars in the field sample .",
    "our field sample has 21 stars in common with the low mass group ( group 1 ) of the field sample from @xcite , the group with the largest difference in the @xmath0 cumulative distribution from their cluster sample . among these 21 stars ,",
    "14 have @xmath34 .",
    "figure  3 shows that the majority of cluster b - stars with mass less than 5 @xmath35 has @xmath36 .",
    "if we assume that the rest of field b - stars in their group 1 are similar to these 21 stars , the slower rotation in group 1 of their field sample can be naturally explained by its older population , instead of the initial conditions ( a low density environment of the star forming region ) as suggested in their paper .",
    "@xcite investigated stellar samples from both low density and high density stellar environments . in their analysis , they first inspected the evolutionary effect ( spin - down ) on stellar rotation , and concluded that the evolutionary effect is too small to account for the difference in stellar rotation that exists between the low and high density samples . however , the evolutionary status of individual stars in their samples is based on the estimated age of the parent association or cluster only .",
    "this approach to evolutionary change is less specific than our estimate based upon the polar gravity of each star , since the individual cluster samples may contain quite different proportions of evolved to unevolved stars .",
    "thus , it is possible that the samples considered by @xcite contain stars that occupy a wider range of evolutionary state than assumed .",
    "consequently , their comparison between the low - density and high - density cumulative probability curves that are based on the whole sample may be influenced more by the evolutionary effect on stellar rotation than the authors realized .    in summary",
    ", our spectroscopic investigation of the stellar rotation of 108 field b - stars suggests that the field b - stars contain a larger fraction of more evolved stars than found among our sample of young cluster stars ( with an average age of 12.5 myr ) and that makes the field stars appear to rotate slower as whole .",
    "this is not a surprising result , since most of the bright field stars belong to the local gould s belt structure that has an expansion age of 30 to 60  myr @xcite . at this point",
    ", we do not see any significant differences between the rotational distributions of the field and young cluster b - stars when considered as a function of evolutionary state .",
    "we applied identical spectroscopic methods to both the field and cluster samples , and this should minimize any method - related errors in the comparison of rotational properties .",
    "we used the estimated @xmath3 as an indicator of evolutionary status for each individual star , a necessary precaution for rapidly rotating stars and for the purpose of our paper .",
    "our field b - star sample is still small . in the near future",
    ", we plan to obtain more spectra of a much larger field b - star sample to improve the statistical basis of our conclusion and to investigate the subgroups in confined stellar mass ranges .",
