    "structural patterns in complex networks occurring in biological , social and technological contexts , have been a focus of study by physicists for a decade , since the groundbreaking discovery of small - world property @xcite and scale - free degree distribution @xcite for many networks .",
    "one of the common features seen in many networks is the occurrence of _ modules _ , namely , subnetworks whose members are highly inter - connected but have few links to nodes outside the module .",
    "many networks have also been seen to have _ hierarchical _ organization , i.e. , they are composed of successive interconnected layers or inter - nested communities . in the literature ,",
    "often the terms hierarchy and modularity have been used almost inter - changeably , although , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hie_mod ] , they represent distinct properties of the network",
    ". however , it is interesting to note that these two properties have been found to coexist in many networks occurring in real life  @xcite , including the internet  @xcite and the network of cortical areas in the cat brain  @xcite .",
    "most of the complex systems seen in real life also have associated dynamics @xcite , and the structural properties of such networks have been sought to be linked with their dynamical behavior  @xcite . in this respect , one of the questions of obvious significance is whether there is a relation between the _ stability _ of the dynamics against small perturbations in the dynamical variables and the specific arrangement of the network s connections .",
    "if the perturbation decays quickly , so that it is unable to spread to the rest of the network , the network is said to be _",
    "stable_. such a property is necessary if networks are to survive the noisy environment that characterizes the real world .",
    "it has sometimes been argued that , networks with larger number of nodes , links and stronger inter - connections are more stable .",
    "such assertions are partly based on empirical observations , e.g. , in ecology , where it has been found that more diverse and strongly connected ecosystems are more robust than their smaller , weakly connected counterparts  @xcite . on the other hand , theoretical work on the stability of model networks have suggested the opposite conclusion . in particular , according to the may - wigner theorem  @xcite for random networks , increasing the complexity ( as measured by the number of nodes , density of connections and dispersion of interaction strengths ) always leads to decreased stability .",
    "however , this result is based on the study of networks whose connection topology shows none of the structures that are seen in real life networks , in particular , modularity and hierarchy .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to see whether introducing hierarchical organization and modular structures can result in refutation of the may - wigner theorem",
    ". early work on the stability of simple , structured model networks  @xcite seemed to indicate that such structures indeed promote stability , and this was also seen under certain conditions for hierarchically organized networks  @xcite .",
    "however , a later study of hierarchical , as well as , modular networks , concluded that these are less stable than corresponding random networks  @xcite .",
    "we revisit this problem in the present paper , by proposing a network model that exhibits both modular structure and hierarchical organization .",
    "in addition to looking at the stability of equilibria of the network dynamics , we also consider the stability of synchronization over the network . although these two stability phenomena are superficially similar , they involve looking at different properties of the network . the issue of network synchronization , in particular , has assumed importance in recent years , owing to its connection with , e.g. , brain dynamics  @xcite .    .",
    "]    an alternative model for hierarchical modular networks has been earlier proposed by ravasz and barabasi ( rb )  @xcite .",
    "this model generates a set of inter - nested modules in a hierarchical fashion using a deterministic procedure that has both high clustering ( because of the modular nature of the network at the most fundamental level ) and a scale - free degree - distribution .",
    "these two properties do not always co - occur in other network models that have been proposed in the literature .",
    "in particular , the barabasi - albert ( ba ) network model  @xcite allows generation of a network with scale - free degree distribution through the preferential attachment mechanism , but the average clustering coefficient of its nodes decays with system size @xmath0 .",
    "further , in the rb model , a scaling relation is observed between the clustering coefficient of a node @xmath1 and its number of connections ( i.e. , degree ) @xmath2 : @xmath3 similar relations were also observed in several real networks , such as the web of semantic connections between two english words which are synonyms  @xcite .",
    "this occurrence of the scaling relation between clustering and degree of the nodes in a network has often been taken as a signature for the existence of hierarchical modular structure in that network . recently",
    ", this scaling relation was shown to be actually an outcome of degree - correlation bias in the usual definition of clustering coefficient  @xcite .",
    "however , it can be easily seen that this scaling relation is not a necessary indicator for the existence of either modularity or hierarchy .",
    "for example , consider a modular network consisting of @xmath0 nodes and @xmath4 modules of equal size .",
    "let each node have degree @xmath2 , with the links initially occurring exclusively between nodes belonging to the same module ( i.e. , the modules are isolated from each other ) . to make the network connected we rewire a small fraction of the links keeping the degree of each node fixed .",
    "plotting clustering as a function of degree for this network will only show vertical spread of points at a single node degree value .",
    "let us consider another example , this time a hierarchical structure , viz . , the cayley tree with @xmath5 branches at each vertex .",
    "again , it is easy to see that the clustering versus degree curve will not show the characteristic scaling seen for the rb model .",
    "in fact , in the next section , we show that even for networks where both hierarchy and modularity are present , it is not necessary that this scaling relation between clustering and node degree will hold .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we introduced a simple model of a modular network with hierarchical organization . in section  [ sec : dynamics ] we introduce the formalism to analyze the stability of dynamical equilibria and synchronized states of a network .",
    "the proposed model allows a detailed study of the relation between dynamical stability and hierarchical modular organization of the network .",
    "we observe that both of these structural properties actually increase the instability compared to an equivalent random network .",
    "this may appear counter - intuitive as both modularity and hierarchy are observed in networks occurring in nature , which necessarily have to be robust to survive environmental fluctuations .",
    "however , the emergence of modular structures can be understood as a response to multiple ( and often conflicting ) constraints imposed on such networks  @xcite .",
    "we conclude with a discussion about how these observations can possibly be extended to explain the emergence of hierarchical organization .",
    ") indicated by broken lines , and the corresponding adjacency matrix ( right ) where @xmath6 indicates the density of connections within and , @xmath7 , between the different modules at each level @xmath8 . ]",
    "here we propose a general model for networks having modular as well as hierarchical structure .",
    "let us begin with a modular network consisting of @xmath4 modules , each containing @xmath9 nodes .",
    "the connectivity ( i.e. , the probability of a link between any pair of nodes ) within each module is @xmath10 , while the connectivity between modules is @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "we now introduce hierarchy by adding another set of @xmath4 modules ( each having @xmath9 nodes ) with the same @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the nodes belonging to these two different sets of modules are now connected , but with a probability @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the resulting network has @xmath15 nodes and @xmath16 hierarchical levels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) . to increase the number of hierarchical levels to @xmath17",
    ", we add a similar network with @xmath18 nodes to the existing network and , as above , add links between these two networks with a probability @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "thus , to get a network with @xmath21 hierarchical levels , the above procedure is repeated @xmath22 times .",
    "the final network contains @xmath23 number of modules .",
    "note that , all connections between nodes are made randomly . to reduce the number of model parameters , we assume that the connectivities @xmath24 are related as : @xmath25 where",
    ", @xmath26 , the ratio of inter - modular connections between two successive hierarchical levels , is a control parameter . by varying @xmath27",
    ", one can switch between isolated modular ( @xmath28 ) and homogeneous random ( @xmath29 ) networks , with intermediate values of @xmath27 giving hierarchical modular networks .",
    "we compare between networks having different number of hierarchical levels @xmath30 , keeping the total number of modules @xmath31 and average degree @xmath32 fixed .",
    "to consider the effect of hierarchy in isolation , while keeping modularity fixed ( e.g. , as measured by the newman modularity measure @xmath33 @xcite ) , we use a variant of the above model , where , @xmath10  =  constant , while other connectivities are still related by @xmath34 this implies that the average number of intra - modular ( @xmath35 ) and inter - modular ( @xmath36 ) connections per node are also constant . , and + @xmath37 $ ] . ]     of the @xmath38-th node as a function of its degree @xmath39 for the hierarchical modular network model proposed here , where each module at @xmath40 is ( left ) a random er network and ( right ) a scale - free ba network .",

    "in addition , as it is hierarchical by construction , we can show that the criterion suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , the scaling relation between clustering and degree , is not a necessary condition for the existence of hierarchical modularity . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ]  ( left ) , when the modules are random networks , the scaling relation is clearly absent for our model network .",
    "to counter the possible argument that this failure of the relation is due to the non - scale - free degree distribution , we have also considered the case where each of the modules is a ba network . although the inter - modular connections are made randomly , the network degree distribution is still scale - free . even for this case ,",
    "a clear scaling relation between clustering and degree is absent ( fig  [ fig : scaling ] , right ) .",
    "to look at the effect of hierarchy on network dynamics , we consider the linear stability of an arbitrarily chosen equilibrium state for a set of coupled differential equations defining the time - evolution of the system . for a network of @xmath0 nodes , a dynamical variable @xmath46 is associated with each node @xmath38 .",
    "the state of the system , @xmath47 , can be characterized by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a general nonlinear function . to investigate the stability around an arbitrary fixed point @xmath50 ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) , we check whether a small perturbation @xmath52 about @xmath50 grows or decays with time .",
    "this perturbation evolves as @xmath53 where , @xmath54 is the jacobian matrix representing the interactions among the nodes : @xmath55 . as we are interested in the instability induced through the connections of the network , rather than the intrinsic instability of individual unconnected nodes , we can",
    "( without much loss of generality ) set the diagonal element @xmath56 .",
    "this implies that , in the absence of any connections , the nodes are self - regulating , i.e. , the fixed point @xmath57 is stable .",
    "the behavior of the perturbation is determined by the largest real part , @xmath58 , of the eigenvalues of @xmath54 .",
    "if @xmath59 , an initially small perturbation will grow exponentially with time , and the system will be rapidly dislodged from the equilibrium state @xmath50 .",
    "the relation between the dynamical properties and the static structure of the network is provided by its adjacency matrix @xmath60 ( with @xmath61 , if nodes @xmath38 and @xmath62 are connected , and @xmath63 otherwise ) .",
    "there is a direct correspondence between the nature of the matrices @xmath54 ( specifying the dynamical behavior of perturbation ) and @xmath60 ( which determines the structure of the underlying directed network ) , because @xmath64 implies @xmath65 . in our model , we have generated @xmath66 by randomly choosing the non - zero elements from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath67 .",

    "thus , a network having a smaller eigenratio @xmath119 , is more likely to show stable synchronized activity .",
    "here , we obtain the eigenvalues of the laplacian @xmath107 for a hierarchical modular network ( fig .  [",

    "first , keeping the number of hierarchical levels fixed , we vary the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "we find that with decreasing @xmath27 , i.e. , as the number of connections between two successive hierarchical levels decrease , the instability of the synchronized state increases .",
    "next , keeping the total number of modules fixed we increase the number of hierarchical levels ( @xmath30 ) in the network .",
    "[ fig : synch ] ( right ) shows that as the number of hierarchal levels of the network is increased , @xmath120 decreases , resulting in an increasing eigenratio .",
    "thus , arranging the modules of a network in a hierarchical fashion also makes a network difficult to synchronize .",
    "in previously published work  @xcite , we have shown that increased modularity in random networks leads to higher probability of instability for the equilibria of the network dynamics .",
    "thus , the work presented here is an extension and generalization of the above result , demonstrating that increased number of hierarchical levels also tend to destabilize these equilibria , and moreover , the same phenomena is observed for the stability of synchronized activity in a network with respect to increased modularity and hierarchy .",
    "this raises the question of how can systems with hierarchical modular structures be seen in nature at all , where they have to be robust enough to survive constant environmental fluctuations .",
    "an answer to this can be fashioned along the lines of our recent work showing that additional natural constraints operating on networks in real life , such as the minimization of ( a )  resource cost for maintaining each link and ( b )  the time required for communicating between nodes , in addition to linear stability of equilibria , will make modular networks the optimal configuration ( fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic_mod ] )  @xcite .",
    "we find such stable , modular networks to possess multiple hubs and a heterogeneous degree distribution .",
    "many types of networks , including scale - free networks  @xcite , can be seen as special cases of this general criterion .",
    "therefore , we can understand the large - scale occurrence of such networks in nature as a response to co - existing structural and dynamical constraints .",
    "one can ask , what will be the effect of introducing constraints other than the ones mentioned here .",
    "for example , replacing the criterion for linear stability by one demanding robustness with respect to removal of links ( selected by using a combination of random and targeted attack strategies ) does not qualitatively change our results .",
    "it turns out that this criterion is satisfied by networks with bimodal degree distribution , a property that our optimal modular networks possess .",
    "however , while this can explain the ubiquity of modularity , it does not answer the question of why hierarchical organization is so common in nature .",
    "the fact that tree - like networks with extensive ramifications occur so often in the context of resource transport ( e.g. , the circulatory system in plants and animals ) suggest that additional constraints related to flow maximization may be at work in this case .",
    "another possible candidate for such a constraint may be the need to minimize wiring cost , i.e. , the total link length  @xcite .",
    "this is applicable when the network is embedded on a geographic ( as opposed to topological ) space , so that the wiring cost can been defined as the sum of the euclidean distances between all connected pairs of nodes .",
    "as many of the networks showing hierarchical organization ( such as the internet and the network of cortical areas in the brain ) are indeed defined in metric space , this is a possibility that needs to be analysed in detail ."
