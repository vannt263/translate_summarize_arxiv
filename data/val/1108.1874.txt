    "the generation of magnetic fields in cosmic environments is generally slower than in galaxies , owing to the longer dynamical timescales .",

    "these effects can be used to set independent constraints on primordial fields during reionization  @xcite . in particular",
    ", the magnetic field adds a pressure term which affects the jeans mass .",
    "also , if the magnetic field is not parallel to the electric current , charges are subject to a lorentz * force*. this gives rise to ambipolar diffusion of the charges through the neutrals and heating of the igm due to collisions between the two species .    in this letter",
    ", we constrain primordial magnetic fields by considering their impact on the reionizaton process .",
    "our analysis is based on the latest data of the high redshift igm . in particular , we use observed uv luminosity function at redshifts @xmath10 @xcite and the recent observations of a @xmath11 quasar @xcite which indicates a fraction of neutral hydrogen of @xmath12 at @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath4ng , similar to findings from the latest cmb analysis  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , our constraint is complementary with the latter as it is based on different physical processes and refers to a different cosmological epoch . throughout",
    "we use the cosmological parameters from wmap7  @xcite .",
    "in order to assess the impact of primordial magnetic fields on reionization we solve the following equation for the evolution of the volume fraction of ionized hydrogen , @xmath13  @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the comoving number density of neutral hydrogen and the other parameters are described below . for our reference model",

    "so , the adopted escape fraction of lyman - continuum photons is @xmath17 .",
    "the temperature of the reionized igm is @xmath18  k , leading to an hydrogen recombination timescale @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the clumping factor normalized to a value of @xmath21 .",

    "these are , respectively @xmath40 with @xmath41 the sound speed and @xmath42 the gas number density , and  @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath2 the co - moving field strength .",
    "finally , to convert the filtering mass scale into a uv magnitude , we use the following relation inferred from fig .  10 of @xcite ( which also consistently reproduces the above limiting magnitude in absence of magnetic field )",

    "the full set of equations is given in @xcite and was implemented in the recfast code @xcite . in particular , the magnetic energy decreases with time due to adiabatic expansion and dissipation into heat through ambipolar diffusion .",
    "for strong fields this can change substantially the thermal and ionization history of the igm , although full reionization can not be achieved this way , as collisions induced by ambipolar diffusion become inefficient at high temperatures .    with the calculation results ,",
    "the thompson scattering optical depth is computed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the thompson scattering cross section and the effective ionization degree is @xmath47 contributed by both the fully ionized volume fraction as well as the partially ionized gas .",
    "in the following , we set the upper limits on the comoving magnetic field strength , @xmath2 , using the thomson optical depth ( a redshift - integrated quantity ) as well as the the observed ionization degree at @xmath3 . we discuss the uncertainties due to the cosmological parameters , the reionization parameters and the observed uv luminosity function .",
    "finally , we discuss the possibility of more stringent constraints from future progress on the high redshift igm .",
    "[ fig : tau ] shows the constraints on @xmath2 due to the observed optical depth , @xmath48 , and its uncertainties . starting from our reference case in the top panel , we see that for weak magnetic fields the optical depth is well within the @xmath16 range of wmap7 results . as @xmath2 increases the low - luminosity cut - off of halos contributing ionizing photons is raised and at @xmath49 ng",
    ", @xmath48 starts to drop .",
    "it reaches a minimum at several ng and then , as collisional ionization resulting from heating due to ambipolar diffusion kicks in , @xmath48 increases again  ( however , values of several ng for @xmath2 , would be inconsistent with cmb observations , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is the qualitative trend in all panels of fig . 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "the top panel also shows the effects of @xmath50 variations of the cosmological parameters , on @xmath48 . for the purpose of the current discussion , * higher * values of @xmath51 and smaller values of @xmath52 increase the value of @xmath48 and thus weaken the constrain on @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the constraint on @xmath2 is set by the highest curve , which says that the required field strength at the 95% cl limit is @xmath21  ng . note also that adopting a cosmology as in @xcite would have minor effects on our results .    in the mid panel",
    "we consider instead the effect due to uncertainties in the reionization parameters .",
    "such uncertainties can in principle be very large .",
    "however , a large clumping factor @xmath53 is inconsistent with the observed ionization fraction ( see fig .",
    "2 ) even in the limit of weak magnetic fields . likewise ,",
    "a very large escape fraction @xmath54 produce too high an ionization rate at @xmath55  @xcite . with these considerations ,",
    "a meaningful 95% cl upper limit of 2ng is implied by our results .",
    "finally , in the bottom panel we consider the uncertainties due to 3@xmath56 observational errors in the parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , of the schechter function . here , it is large values of @xmath59 or @xmath31 that increase @xmath48 , and therefore weaken our constraint .",
    "thus , the highest curve on the plot shows that the computed value of @xmath48 remains within @xmath60 of the wmap7 result for @xmath613ng .",
    "note that the redshift evolution of the schechter function parameters is also very uncertain , but we have verified that it does not lead to more significant uncertainties on the current constraints .",
    "we thus arrive at a 95% cl upper limit of @xmath62  ng on @xmath2 .",
    "[ fig : ion ] shows the constraints due to the observed ionization degree , @xmath63 , and its uncertainties . following the analysis of  @xcite",
    ", the igm is assumed mostly ionized at @xmath3 .",
    "note that for the present purposes the accurate value of the ionization degree is not crucial and even a 90% value would lead to very strong constraints independent of the specifically adopted cl . in our reference case ( top panel )",
    ", we find at @xmath64 an ionization degree close to 1 for co - moving field strengths up to @xmath65  ng . for increasing field strengths",
    ", @xmath63 drops rapidly , as the magnetic jeans mass increases with @xmath66 , significantly suppressing the production of ionizing photons . thus considering all the uncertainties due to the cosmological parameters",
    "leads to @xmath67ng .",
    "as already discussed for the optical depth , the uncertainties due to the reionization parameters are considerably higher ( mid panel ) .",
    "however , cases with high clumping factors , low escape fractions or low igm temperatures and even very high escape fraction  @xcite are inconsistent even in the limit of weak magnetic fields . for the remaining cases , the ionization degree drops rapidly for @xmath2 above a ng , and the most conservative upper limit corresponds again to @xmath68 2ng .",
    "as for the uncertainties in the parameters of the schechter function bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ion ] shows that some extreme values can be ruled out because inconsistent with the ionization degree at @xmath64 , even with negligible @xmath2 .",
    "however , the most important source of uncertainty for the upper limit on @xmath2 are those related to @xmath31 .",
    "this forces our constraint to @xmath61 3ng .",
    "this constraint will be improved once the schechter function is observed more accurately .",
    "again , we checked that the uncertainties in the redshift evolution have no impact on our results.from the observed ionization degree , we thus find an overall constraint @xmath4  ng .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : redshift ] we show the ionization degree at different redshifts as a function of the co - moving field strength .",
    "the plot illustrates the sensitivity of our constraint to the redshift at which the ionization degree is measured",
    ". in particular our constraint would be slightly weaker if based on data at @xmath69 , while it would considerably improve if a high ionization degree at @xmath70 could be observationally established . at even higher redshifts ,",
    "our model predicts the presence of a substantial neutral fraction in the igm which could be translated into a further independent constraint .",
    "using the combined constraints from the observed thomson optical depth , the ionization degree of the igm at @xmath64 and the observed uv luminosity function at high redshifts , we have derived robust upper limits of @xmath71  ng , virtually independent of the cl , on the strength of primordial magnetic fields .",
    "previous work  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also introduction ) found similar limits but generally was based on the thomson optical depth only , used less refined physical models , had a lower cl .",
    "however , the similarity of conclusion also suggests that we are approaching the intrinsic limitation of the methods .",
    "our results are mostly based on the lower cutoff of the luminosity function of galaxies contributing ionizing photons , set by the magnetic jeans mass ( eq .  [ jeansb ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "heating effects due to ambipolar diffusion are important for @xmath2 close to 10 ng , which is ruled out by cmb observations .",
    "our constraints on the primordial magnetic field would be mostly strengthened by measurements of a high ionization degree at redshift @xmath72 .",
    "this is simply because the earlier the igm is reionized , the more important becomes the contribution of ionizing photons from halos whose collapse is hindered by primordial magnetic fields .",
    "however , improvements beyond an order of magnitude are likely out of reach , as the formation of structure at the magnetic jeans mass corresponding to 10@xmath73 g ( see eq .  [ jeansb ] ) is severely affected by other feedback processes  ( see , e.g. , discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "other limiting factors in the derivation of our constraints are mostly due to uncertainties in the uv luminosity function at high redshift and lack of information about the igm ionization fraction at redshift higher than 7 .",
    "there is reason to expect good progress in these areas in the near future .",
    "for example , jwst will provide a unique opportunity to probe the igm at and beyond redshift @xmath74 , lyman @xmath57 emitters may provide additional information on the strength of the photoionizing background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the planck satellite will provide an improved measurement of the thomson optical depth .",
    "these additional data may help to improve our understanding both with respect to reionization and the origin of magnetic fields .",
