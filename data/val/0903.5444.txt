    "receding horizon control is a popular paradigm for designing control policies . in the context of deterministic systems",
    "it has received a considerable amount of attention over the last two decades , and significant advancements have been made in terms of its theoretical foundations as well as industrial applications .",
    "the motivation comes primarily from the fact that receding horizon control yields tractabile control laws for deterministic systems in the presence of constraints , and has consequently become popular in the industry .",
    "the counterpart in the context of stochastic systems , however , is a relatively recent development . in this article",
    "we solve the problem of stochastic receding horizon control for linear systems subject to additive ( possibly ) unbounded disturbances and hard norm bounds on the control inputs , over a class of feedback policies .",
    "methods for guaranteeing hard bounds on the control inputs , within our context , while ensuring tractability of the underlying optimization problem are , to our knowledge , not available in the current literature .",
    "preliminary results in this direction were reported in @xcite .    in the deterministic setting , the receding horizon control scheme is dominated by worst - case analysis relying on robust control and robust optimization methods , see , for example , @xcite and the references therein .",
    "the central idea is to synthesize a controller based on the bounds of the noise such that a certain target set becomes invariant with respect to the closed - loop dynamics .",
    "however , such an approach tends to yield rather conservative controllers and large infeasibility regions .",
    "moreover , assigning an a priori bound to the noise seems to demand considerable insight .",
    "a stochastic model of the noise is a natural alternative approach to this problem : the conservativeness of worst - case controllers may be reduced , and one may not need to impose any a priori bounds on the maximum magnitude of the noise . in  @xcite ,",
    "the authors reformulate the stochastic programming problem as a deterministic one with bounded noise and solve a robust optimization problem over a finite horizon , followed by estimating the performance when the noise is unbounded but takes high values with low probability ( as in the gaussian case ) . in  @xcite a slightly different problem is addressed in which the noise enters in a multiplicative manner , and hard constraints on the states and control inputs are relaxed to constraints resembling the integrated chance constraints of @xcite or risk measures in mathematical finance .",
    "similar relaxations of hard constraints to soft probabilistic ones have also appeared in  @xcite for both multiplicative and additive noise inputs , as well as in  @xcite for additive noise inputs .",
    "there are also other approaches , e.g. , those employing randomized algorithms as in  @xcite .",
    "related lines of research can be found in  @xcite dealing with constrained model predictive control ( mpc ) for stochastic systems motivated by industrial applications , in  @xcite dealing with stochastic stability , in @xcite dealing with q - design , in , e.g. , @xcite dealing with alternative approaches to control under actuator constraints and neural - network approximation .",
    "the articles @xcite deal with a formulation that allows probabilistic state constraints but not hard input constraints , and is hence complementary to the approach in the present article , and @xcite treats the case of output feedback . .",
    "finally , note that probabilistic constraints on the controllers naturally raise difficult questions on what actions to take when such constraints are violated , see  @xcite and  @xcite for partial solutions to these issues .",
    "the main contributions of the article are as follows : we give a tractable , convex , and globally feasible solution to the finite - horizon stochastic linear quadratic ( lq ) problem for linear systems with possibly unbounded additive noise and hard constraints on the elements of the control policy . within this framework one",
    "has two directions to pursue in terms of controller design , namely , a posteriori bounding the standard lqg controller , or employing certainty - equivalent receding horizon controller . while the former direction explicitly incorporates some aspects of feedback ,",
    "the synthesis of the latter involves control constraints and implicitly incorporates the notion of feedback .",
    "our choice of feedback policies explores the middle ground between these two choices : we explicitly incorporate both the control bounds and feedback at the design phase .",
    "more specifically , we adopt a policy that is affine in certain bounded functions of the past noise inputs .",
    "the optimal control problem is lifted onto general vector spaces of candidate control functions from which the controller can be selected algorithmically by solving a convex optimization problem .",
    "our novel approach does not require artificially relaxing the hard constraints on the control input to soft probabilistic ones ( to ensure large feasible sets ) , and still provides a globally feasible solution to the problem .",
    "minimal assumptions of the noise sequence being i.i.d and having finite second moment are imposed .",
    "the effect of the noise appears in the convex optimization problem as certain fixed cross - covariance matrices , which may be computed off - line and stored .",
    "once tractability of the optimization problem is ensured , we employ the resulting control policy in a receding horizon scheme . under our policies",
    "the closed - loop system is in general not necessarily markovian , and as a result stability of the closed - loop system is not immediate .",
    "in fact , we can no longer appeal directly to standard foster - lyapunov methods .",
    "we establish that our receding horizon control scheme provides stability under the assumption that the zero - input and zero - noise system is asymptotically stable .",
    "we provide examples that demonstrate the effectiveness of our policies with respect to standard methods such as certainty - equivalent mpc , standard unconstrained lqg and saturated lqg control .",
    "these examples show that our policies perform no worse than the standard unconstrained lqg controller in the absence of control constraints , and outperform the certainty - equivalent mpc as well as the saturated lqg control by a significant margin .",
    "our mechanism for selection of a policy consists of two steps : the first concerns the structure of our policies , and is motivated by preceding work in robust optimization and mpc @xcite .",
    "the second concerns the procedure for selection of an optimal policy from a general vector space of candidate control functions , and is inspired by approximate dynamic programming techniques @xcite . with respect to the first step ,",
    "our policies are more general compared to those in @xcite . with respect to the second , the selection procedure of our policies consists of a one - step tractable static optimization program .    the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section [ s : ps ]",
    "we state the main problem to be solved in the most general form . in section",
    "[ s : mainres ] we provide a tractable solution to the finite horizon optimization problem on general vector spaces .",
    "this result is specialized to various classes of noise and input constraint sets in section [ s : if ] .",
    "stability of receding horizon implementations of the obtained closed - loop policy is shown in section [ sec : stability ] , and input - to - state stability properties are discussed in section [ sec : iss ] .",
    "we provide a host of numerical examples that illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion on future research directions .",
