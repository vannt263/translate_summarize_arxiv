    "in constraining the negative energy contribution to the friedmann equation , a variety of astronomical observations were used , such as snia data @xcite , friib rg data @xcite , baryon oscillation peak and cmbr observations . although we can obtain the bounds on the sum of density parameters for all fluids scaling like radiation , it is impossible to determine the contribution coming from each component . in particular",
    "it is impossible to determine the negative energy density arising from the casimir effect or dark radiation and positive energy density arising from radiation because they scale with respect to redshift in the same way in the friedmann equation .",
    "we note that the cmbr and big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) offer stringent conditions on this term , which can be regarded as an established upper limit on any individual components of negative energy density , and therefore on the casimir effect , global rotation , discreteness of space following loop quantum gravity or brane dark radiation .",
    "we argue that even if the precise value of the density parameter for fictitious fluid is known from observations , it is still not possible to determine the nature ( or , say , the origin ) of the global rotation of the universe using measurements basing on geometrical optics only , i.e. null geodesics @xmath2 .",
    "for example , if we consider the origin of this negative radiation - like term from global rotation effects , then it is not possible to come up with different forms of contribution leading to the same expression of @xmath3 type .",
    "there are , in principle , three different interpretations of the presence of the negative radiation term in the @xmath4 relation , as follows .",
    "the casimir effect is a simple observational consequence of the existence of quantum fluctuation @xcite .",
    "the casimir force between conducting plates leads to a repulsive force , like the positive cosmological constant .",
    "moreover , different laboratory experiments were designed to measure the casimir affect with increased precision and thus strengthen the constraints on corrections to newtonian gravitational law @xcite . for a survey of recently obtained results in casimir - energy studies see @xcite . for our purpose , it is important that the effect of casimir energy , which scales like radiation , can contribute into the @xmath4 relation  crucial for any kinematical test .",
    "it is also interesting that the same type of contribution to the effective energy density can be produced by loop quantum theory effects in semi - classical quantum cosmology @xcite .",
    "these effects give rise to an evolutionary scenario in which the initial singularity is replaced by a bounce .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the casimir - type contributions arising from tachyon condensation are possible @xcite .    in the brane world scenario ,",
    "our universe is a submanifold which is embedded in a higher - dimensional spacetime , called ` bulk space ' . in the randall and sundrum scenario @xcite ,",
    "the einstein equations restricted to the brane reduce to a generalization of the frw equation with additional terms .",
    "one of these terms , called dark radiation , is of considerable interest because it scales like radiation @xcite .",
    "this term arises from the non - vanishing electric part of the five dimensional weyl tensor .",
    "dark radiation strongly effects both bbn and cmbr .",
    "ichiki et al .",
    "@xcite gave limits on the possible contribution as @xmath5 from bbn and @xmath6 at the @xmath7 confidence level from cmbr measurements .",
    "let us note that a small negative contribution of dark radiation can also reconcile the tension between the observed @xmath8 and @xmath9 abundances @xcite .",
    "let us consider newtonian cosmology following senovilla et al .",
    ". then we can define , following the authors , a homogeneous newtonian cosmology with @xmath10 and @xmath11 having no spatial dependence , i.e. @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and we require that the velocity vector fields depends linearly on the spatial coordinates .",
    "then the equation , which represents shear - free newtonian cosmologies with expansion and rotation , well known as the heckmann - schcking model @xcite takes the following form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the rotation scalar and @xmath16 is an integration constant .",
    "we interprete it in terms of curvature constant although in the newtonian spacetime the curvature is zero . for our purpose , it is important that the effect of rotation produces a negative term in the newtonian analogue of the friedmann equation .    in the newtonian cosmology in contrast to general relativity rotation",
    "can appear in homogenous and isotropic space .",
    "in general relativity the effect of rotation are strictly related to non - vanishing shear .",
    "the homogeneous universe with non - vanishing shear may expand and rotate relative to local gyroscopes .",
    "the relation between the rotation of the universe and the origin of the rotation of galaxies was also investigated @xcite .",
    "additionally , the role of rotation of objects in the universe , their significance and astronomical measurements was recently addressed by @xcite ) .",
    "usually the fundamental test of a cosmological model is based on the luminosity distance @xmath17 as a function of redshift @xcite . for the distant snia",
    ", one can directly observe their apparent magnitude @xmath18 and redshift @xmath19 . because the absolute magnitude @xmath20 of the supernovae is related to its absolute luminosity @xmath21 , the relation between distance modulus @xmath22 , the luminosity distance @xmath17 , the observed magnitude @xmath18 and the absolute magnitude @xmath23 has the following form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the luminosity distance of a supernova can be obtain as the function of redshift : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "we assumed @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "daly and djorgovski @xcite ( see also @xcite ) proposed the inclusion of radio galaxies in the analysis . to accomplish this , it is useful to use the coordinate distance defined as : @xmath33    daly and djorgovski @xcite have compiled a sample comprising the data on @xmath34 for 157 snia in the riess et al .",
    "@xcite gold dataset and 20 friib radio galaxies . in our data sets",
    "we also include 115 snia compiled by astier et  al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the coordinate distance @xmath34 does not depend on the value of @xmath1 from definition .",
    "however , when we compute the coordinate distance from the luminosity distance ( or the distance modulus @xmath22 ) the knowledge of the value of @xmath1 is required . for each sample",
    "we choose the values of @xmath1 which were used in original papers .",
    "we used the distance modulus presented in ref .",

    "we choose the values of @xmath1 apropriate to the data sets . for riess",

    "8) was calculated with such an arbitrary value of @xmath36 .",
    "the error of the coordinate distance can be computed as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the statistical error of distance modulus determination ( note that for astier et  al.s sample the intrinsic dispersion was also included ) and @xmath39 km / s mpc denotes error in @xmath1 measurements .",

    "have analysed the baryon oscillation peaks ( bop ) detected in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) luminosity red galaxies @xcite .",
    "they found that value of @xmath40 @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) is equal @xmath44 .",
    "the quoted uncertainty corresponds to one standard deviation , where a gaussian probability distribution has been assumed .",
    "it is also possible include in our analysis the so called the ( cmbr ) `` shift parameter '' @xmath45 where @xmath46 @xcite .    in our combined analysis ,",
    "we can obtain a best fit model by minimizing the pseudo-@xmath47 merit function @xcite : @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 denotes value of @xmath40 and @xmath52 obtained for particular set of the model parameter . for astier",

    "one can minimize the following likelihood function @xmath54 . however , to constrain a particular model parameter , the likelihood function marginalized over the remaining parameters of the model should be considered @xcite .",

    ", the bbn epoch never occurs and all bbn predictions would be lost .    to obtain stronger constraints on the model parameters ,",
    "it is useful to use the cmbr observations .",
    "the hotter and colder spots in the cmbr can be interpreted as acoustic oscillations in the primeval plasma during the last scattering .",
    "it is very interesting that the locations of these peaks are very sensitive to variations in the model parameters .",
