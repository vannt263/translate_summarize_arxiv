    "the transport properties of single electron transistors ( sets ) have been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally.@xmath0 the main structure of sets consists of a single quantum dot ( qd ) and three electrodes ( source , drain and gate ) .",
    "the manipulation of sets is based on coulomb blockade effect arising from the particle interactions of qd . from the practical point of view , it is important for sets to operate at room temperature .",
    "therefore , the size of qd is required to be less than @xmath1 for silicon ( si ) or germanium ( ge ) semiconductor qds . in such size range of qd , the quantum confinement effects and charging energies of qds are larger than the thermal energy of room temperature .",
    "recently , the coulomb oscillation and staircase features of tunneling current of room temperature sets have been reported by several groups , where si or ge qds are embedded into @xmath2 matrix@xmath3 .",
    "even though it is difficult to align a single qd of nanometer with electrodes in the fabrication of individual sets , several methods were used to solve this difficulty .",
    "nevertheless , those methods still can not precisely control the barrier thickness , which significantly influences the tunneling time for electrons to access qds .",
    "further understanding for the location of qds , the implementation technology of sets using thermal oxidation method@xmath4 can be improved .",
    "the measurement of transient current can provide above information . in this study",
    "we apply the current formula of ref .",
    "[ 2 ] to examine the transient current of the set with asymmetrical tunneling rates at room temperature .",
    "it is found that the transient current exhibits exponential decay when electrons are injected into the qds from the left electrode and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents the tunneling rate for electrons from the left ( right ) electrode to the qd , on the other hand the transient current exhibits the exponential growth as @xmath7 .",
    "in addition to theoretical studies of transient current , we report the experimental measurement of transient current of single hole transistor ( sht ) .",
    "the transient current of a set consisted of a single qd and three electrodes was theoretically derived by jauho , wingreen and meir.@xmath8 when applied voltage is insufficient to overcome the charging energies arising from electron - electron repulsion interactions in the qd , the time - dependent tunneling current through the ground state of qd can be expressed as ( ref.[2 ] ) @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 according to eq .",
    "( 1 ) , there are four components for the net current from the left electrode to the right electrode .",
    "the current of eq .",
    "( 2 ) , @xmath12 , denotes the current flowing out from the qd to the left ( right ) electrode .",
    "this current results from the time - dependent electron occupation number of qd , which is given by @xmath13 @xmath14 denotes the current flowing into the qd from the left ( right ) electrode .",
    "obviously , @xmath14 is determined by the time - dependent spectrum function @xmath15 where @xmath16 means taking the imaginary part of @xmath17 .",
    "notations @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote , respectively , the electron charge and plank s constant . for the simplicity",
    ", we assume that the tunneling rates @xmath6 are bias and energy independent .",
    "@xmath20 and @xmath21 denote , respectively , the tunneling rates from the left and right electrodes to the qd .",
    "@xmath22 is the fermi distribution function of the left ( right ) electrode .",
    "the chemical potential difference is related by the applied voltage @xmath23 . from the results of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , the time - dependent spectrum function plays a crucial role in the determination of time - dependent tunneling current .",
    "the system studied here considers that the step - like modulation is added into the gate electrode , the expression of @xmath17 is obtained as    @xmath24\\\\ \\nonumber & \\cdot & exp^{i(\\epsilon-(e_1-e v_g)+i\\frac{\\gamma}{2 } ) t},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 is the ground state energy level of qd .",
    "@xmath26 . in the absence of gate voltage",
    "@xmath27 the @xmath28 becomes time - independent retarded green s function @xmath29 .",
    "the resonant energy level @xmath25 is shifted to @xmath30 , that is @xmath31 , when the system goes into steady state . in the transient process",
    "the density of states of qd depends on time .",
    "consequently , @xmath32 displays time - dependent behavior in the transient process .",
    "due to the complicate spectrum function , the transient current lacks analytic form . to numerically calculate @xmath32",
    ", we set the fermi energy level of electrodes and the ground state energy level @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the energy levels of qd are empty at zero temperature under zero bias .",
    "first of all , we plot the time - dependent tunneling current through a symmetric double - barrier tunneling structure with @xmath35 and @xmath36 in response to a step - like modulation for different applied voltages at zero temperature in fig . 1 : solid line @xmath37 , dashed line @xmath38 and dotted line ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the tunneling current is zero at @xmath40 since the fermi level of electrodes is below the resonant state @xmath25 .",
    "when the gate voltage is added into the system , electrons from the left electrode are injected into the new resonant energy level @xmath41 .",
    "consequently , the tunneling current jumps instantly and finally reaches the steady state .",
    "current also displays an interesting ringing behavior , which was pointed out in ref.[2 ] .",
    "the oscillations of the curve do not maintain constant frequency in the transient process .",
    "in addition , the frequency of oscillations is increased , when the separation between the fermi energy of left electrode and the resonant level @xmath25 is decreased . due to symmetry tunneling rates ,",
    "the behavior of @xmath32 can be understood by the analysis of @xmath42,where    @xmath43\\\\ \\nonumber & \\cdot & cos((\\epsilon - e_1+ev_g)t)exp^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}t}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and @xmath44\\cdot sin((\\epsilon - e_1+ev_g)t)exp^{-\\frac{\\gamma}{2}t}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we plot @xmath45 ( dashed line ) and @xmath46 ( dotted line ) in fig .",
    "2 . @xmath45 exhibits the behavior of @xmath47 , but @xmath46 exhibits the oscillation . owing to the fermi energy of right electrode away from @xmath41 , we see small contribution from the @xmath48 . from the results of fig .",
    "2 , the oscillation of the solid curve shown in fig . 2",
    "is consisted of two frequencies @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which are , respectively , given by @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "( 7 ) reveals that the frequency of oscillation depends on not only @xmath51 , but also @xmath27 . to demonstrate it",
    ", we show @xmath32 for different applied gate voltages and @xmath52 in fig .",
    "3 : solid line ( @xmath53 ) , dashed line ( @xmath54 ) , dotted line ( @xmath55 ) and dot - dashed line ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "we see that the frequency of oscillation can be tuned by the magnitude of applied gate voltage . for @xmath56 ,",
    "the fermi energy level is just aligned with @xmath41 , the oscillatory behavior of tunneling current almost vanishes .",
    "although the charge density of qd is not be directly measured , we plot @xmath57 in fig .",
    "4 , where the curves correspond to those of fig .",
    "it is very clear that qd is empty before the gate voltage turns on .",
    "when the system reaches the steady state , the value of @xmath57 is fractional due to the result of opened system .",
    "it is unexpect that @xmath57 does not exhibit very manifest oscillation feature as well as @xmath32 .",
    "because the width of tunneling barrier could not be precisely controlled in the fabrication of sets , we attempt to study the tunneling current for the case of asymmetrical tunneling rates .",
    "we show @xmath32 for different tunneling rate ratio in fig . 5 : the curves from the bottom to the top ( for @xmath58 )",
    "correspond to @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "meanwhile @xmath61 .",
    "note that other parameters used in fig .",
    "5 are the same as those of the solid line of fig .",
    "1 . it is worthy noting that the maximum steady current occurs for the symmetry tunneling rates .",
    "this is consistent with other theoretical reports@xmath62 .",
    "in addition , the steady current of @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is the same as that of @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "this indicates that the formula given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) maintains the asymmetry of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "it is not avoided for high temperature sets to study the temperature effect on the transient current .",
    "figure 6 shows @xmath32 with symmetry tunneling rates for different temperatures at @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the ringing behavior of @xmath32 is swept out by temperatures . in addition , the magnitude of @xmath32 is suppressed with increasing temperature since the right electrode provides current @xmath69 into the qd , which is opposite to @xmath70 . consequently , the net current becomes small with increasing temperature .",
    "we also show the charge density @xmath57 in fig . 7 :",
    "solid line ( @xmath71 ) and dashed line ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "we see that @xmath73 approaches the same value for @xmath74 and @xmath71 in the steady state . to understand this feature , we plot @xmath75 and @xmath76 , which are defined as the charge density provided from the left and right electrodes , respectively . in the steady state ( or a large time ) , @xmath75 declines with increasing temperature , on the other hand @xmath76 increases with increasing temperature .",
    "we see that they compensate in each other .",
    "next , we study the transient current for the case of different tunneling rate ratio @xmath77 at room temperature @xmath71 . comparing with the results at zero temperature ,",
    "the oscillation structure of @xmath32 at room temperature is more complicate due to the enhancement of @xmath48 .",
    "for @xmath63 and @xmath65 , the former exhibits the exponential decay , the latter exhibits the exponential growth .",
    "this indicates that the location of qd exists a considerable effect on the transient transport properties of sets .",
    "even though the above theoretical analysis is for sets , we attempt to report the experimental measurement of the transient current of ge sht .",
    "for multivalley conduction band of germanium semiconductors , the intervalley interaction effect can not be ignored . however , such effect is not included in eq .",
    "the more realistic system described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) is a ge sht , where valence band is a single valley . in figure 9",
    "we show the transient current of ge sht for two different applied voltages @xmath78 and @xmath52 at room temperature and @xmath79 .",
    "the detailed fabrication process of ge shts and measurement technique of transient current will be discussed in elsewhere@xmath80 .",
    "the solid lines are the experimental curves .",
    "the dashed lines are the fitting curves . according to fitting curves ,",
    "the transient currents display exponential growth feature .",
    "based on previous theoretical analysis , the ge sht has the characteristic of @xmath81 .",
    "two fitting curves also provide the bias - dependent tunneling times @xmath82 and @xmath83 for the applied bias @xmath78 and @xmath52 .",
    "this very long tunneling time is arising from a fact of very high barrier of @xmath2 which the ge qd is embedded into .",
    "besides , we observe the small oscillation structures on the exponential growth curves .",
    "the oscillation structures vanish for sufficient long time .",
    "this indicates that this oscillation structures are not the measurement error .",
    "owing to the lack of information about the detailed size and shape of qd , there are some difficulties to do the detailed comparison between the theoretical calculation and experimental measurement .",
    "in this study the transient current of a set is investigated by using the formula derived by jauho , wingreen and meir.@xmath8 the tunneling rate ratio exists a considerable influence on the transient current of sets .",
    "the tunneling current of a single ge sht at room temperature displays the oscillation structures in the transient process .",
    "this feature is attributed to time - dependent density of states of qd in a switching on the gate voltage .",
