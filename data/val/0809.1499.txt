    "theoretically , the energy loss of heavy quarks in qgp has been estimated in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) techniques @xcite . however , it was pointed out recently that the convergence of the weak coupling expansion of the drag force for heavy quarks is rather poor at the temperature relevant to rhic and lhc , so that the calculation in the leading order would not be reliable @xcite . possible alternative way to estimate",
    "the drag force is to use the duality conjecture between the gauge theory and string theory ( ads / cft correspondence ) @xcite .",
    "although it can be applied only to the @xmath3 supersymmetric yang - mills plasma with large t hooft coupling , the result obtained may provide us with a hint for the drag force in the strong coupling regime of the qcd plasma if appropriate translation is made @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the connection between the drag force acting on the charm and bottom quarks in qgp and the final electron spectra . to make such connection , we introduce relativistic langevin equation for heavy quarks under the background of the quark - gluon fluid described by the ideal hydrodynamics .",

    "if these time scales satisfy @xmath11 , one can describe the brownian particle by the langevin equation @xcite .",
    "in such a situation that the charm / bottom diffuses inside the quark - gluon plasma , there are some extra complications : ( i ) the background quark - gluon fluid expands rapidly in space and time with the local 4-velocity @xmath12 , and ( ii ) the initial momentum distribution of the charm / bottom governed by the hard qcd process has high momentum component larger than their quark masses .    as for ( i ) , we define the langevin equation in the rest frame of matter ( @xmath13 ) and the real motion of the brownian particle is obtained by the local lorentz boost back to the moving frame . as for ( ii ) ,",
    "we take into account the relativistic kinematics of the brownian particle in a minimal way by using relativistic dispersion relation @xmath14 .",

    ", these processes are found to have different momentum dependence of the heavy quark and could become comparable in magnitude @xcite .",
    "recently , the convergence of such weak - coupling expansion was questioned by an explicit calculation of the collisional process in the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) @xcite : the drag coefficient for the 3-color , 3-flavor qcd in the non - relativistic kinematics ( @xmath41 ) reads @xmath42 for the qcd coupling constant relevant at rhic and lhc ( @xmath43 ) , the weak - coupling expansion has an obvious problem of convergence . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", it has been argued in the past that relatively large drag force is necessary to account for the rhic data @xcite .",

    "( ii ) at ultra - high energies @xmath60 , the dominant energy loss occurs through the induced emission of the gluons . in this case",
    ", the condition @xmath61 is violated .",
