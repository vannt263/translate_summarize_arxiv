    "in a recent paper@xcite , the bgr - collaboration presented results on light hadron ( down to @xmath4 ) quenched spectroscopy with two different actions : the parametrized fixed point ( fp ) action@xcite and the ci action which is a combination of the lscher - weisz gauge action@xcite with a chirally improved dirac operator@xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend the scaling analysis in ref.@xcite on the fp action by adding new results on an @xmath5 lattice with lattice unit @xmath6fm .",
    "this extension is necessary , since our scaling test in @xcite referred to a small @xmath7fm spatial size lattice with low statistics , while our large @xmath8fm lattice results with good statistics could be compared with other simulations only .",
    "the new data have been used already in a scaling test on the @xmath9 scattering length@xcite .",
    "no cut - off effects were seen there , but it is difficult to measure the scattering length precisely .",
    "we need reliable information on the cut - off effects in the quenched approximation since these results help to choose the parameters of future full qcd simulations the bgr collaboration is moving towards .",
    "in addition , this information might be helpful when comparing the results from different actions for consistency .",
    "indeed , there exist unclarified inconsistencies between different works in light hadron spectroscopy . on the ape plot , for example ,",
    "the cp - pacs@xcite continuum extrapolated numbers lie significantly below the data obtained with most of the different improved actions . for a recent comparison of numerical data obtained with different actions see ref .",
    "@xcite .    the parametrized fp dirac operator lives on the hypercube , has 81 offsets , a large number of paths , uses all the elements of the clifford algebra@xcite and satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation up to parametrization errors .",
    "the setup of the present simulation and the analysis follows closely those applied in ref.@xcite .",
    "we generated 180 gauge configurations separated by 500 alternating metropolis and pseudo over - relaxation sweeps at gauge coupling @xmath10 .",
    "at this coupling the lattice unit is @xmath6fm as determined from the sommer parameter @xmath11fm@xcite .",
    "as it is well known , it is difficult to give an estimate on the systematic errors of @xmath12 if the lattice is not fine . at this resolution",
    ", the systematic error should be on the percent level , while the statistical error is smaller than @xmath13@xcite .",
    "the spatial extension of the lattice is @xmath14fm . in our earlier results obtained at @xmath15fm and @xmath8fm at resolution",
    "@xmath16fm we saw no finite size effects beyond the statistical errors .",
    "our scaling analysis might be influenced by small finite size effects , however , and these physical effects might mix with the topological finite size artifacts as we discuss below .    before summarizing our results ,",
    "let us make two general remarks concerning scaling analyses in light hadron spectroscopy .",
    "although the most interesting part of the spectrum for physics is where the quark masses go to their small physical values , the heavier quarks bring more information for scaling studies : the hadrons are more compact , they are more difficult to resolve and the cut - off effects are expected to be larger .",
    "in addition , the statistical and systematic errors are smaller , so the analysis is more conclusive .",
    "the second remark refers to a special artifact of _ quenched _ light hadron spectroscopy : the topological finite size artifacts .",
    "the discrete zero modes of the dirac operator at @xmath17 are not suppressed in the quenched approximation and , in a finite volume at sufficiently small quark masses , they will corrupt the hadron propagators@xcite . in ref.@xcite we eliminated / reduced the topological finite size artifacts by using special hadron correlators in the pseudoscalar ( ps ) , nucleon ( n ) and delta ( @xmath18 ) channels .",
    "unfortunately , in the vector channel we did not find a natural solution for this problem and the artifacts turned out to be larger at @xmath6fm than at @xmath19fm in the same physical volume @xmath15fm .",
    "the effect is seen in the vector meson mass at the lightest quark masses in fig .",
    "[ fig : rawdata ] , where the dimensionless hadron masses are shown as the function of the dimensionless quark mass .",
    "this feature ( namely , the bending down of the vector meson curve at small quark masses ) is very similar to the artifacts we saw earlier appearing in smaller volumes , and then disappearing in our largest box with @xmath8fm@xcite .",
    "these quenching artifacts should be separated from the cut - off effects in a scaling test .",
    "this is relevant in particular in the vector channel , since the vector meson mass is used traditionally ( unfortunately ) as a unit for other hadron masses .",
    "the problem occurs at sufficiently light quark masses only , which gives an additional argument to avoiding this region in scaling studies .",
    "the hadron masses as the function of the quark mass in lattice units at @xmath20fm in a box of size @xmath15fm.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we give here a brief summary of our conclusions . considering mass ratios ( like in the ape plot , or measuring the masses in units of a well determined fixed hadron mass ) we see small cut - off effects in the baryon channel when comparing the results at @xmath16 and 0.102fm resolutions .",
    "the effect is seen for relative heavy quarks beyond the statistical errors . in the @xmath21 channel",
    "this is a several standard deviation effect and has a size of up to @xmath22 in the ratio @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the vector meson mass . in the nucleon and delta channels the cut - off effects are smaller , but for heavy quarks they are also visible beyond the statistical errors",
    "this small shift brings the fp results on the ape plot closer to and essentially consistent with the cp - pacs continuum extrapolated results with wilson fermions@xcite .",
    "the improved staggered ( asqtad@xcite ) data at @xmath25fm@xcite with heavier quarks lie a few standard deviations higher and are close to the cp - pacs results at @xmath26fm . in addition , unlike at @xmath16fm , we see a discrepancy in the overall scale obtained in the gauge sector from the sommer parameter @xmath27 and the scale from the spectrum of light hadrons .",
    "the hadron sector prefers a scale of @xmath28fm as opposed to the scale of @xmath6fm . in this case",
    ", however , it is difficult to estimate the systematic errors .",
    "concerning the details of the analysis we refer to ref.@xcite . in order to avoid very busy figures we shall use a few selected results only from other works in this paper .",
    "one can get a more complete picture by combining the figures here with those in ref.@xcite .",
    "the measured new data are collected in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "[ fig : overview ] gives a quick overview on the cut - off effects in the different channels . in this figure",
    "the hadron masses are measured in @xmath29 units , where @xmath29 is the vector meson mass at @xmath30 .",
