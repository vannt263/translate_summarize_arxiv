    "liquids under confinement represent a field of growing interest in science due to the connection with relevant technological and biophysical problems  @xcite . in this",
    "field modifications of both the phase diagram and dynamics of the confined liquid with respect to the bulk represent a key point , in particular as far as the possibility of supercooling is concerned  @xcite .",
    "experiments exhibit a very diversified phenomenology for supercooled confined liquids .",
    "in particular the calorimetric glass transition temperature , @xmath0 , can increase  @xcite , decrease  @xcite or be unaffected  @xcite with respect to the the bulk value depending on the liquid , the confining geometry and the nature of the substrate .",
    "phenomenological arguments predict the existence of domains of cooperative dynamics in the supercooled liquid  @xcite .",
    "the size of these domains is expected to grow upon supercooling .",
    "the existence of an upper bound for the domain size in confined media implies a decrease of @xmath0 upon confinement .",
    "in fact if this size remains small on supercooling then the probability of a cooperative motion , and therefore of a structural relaxation , is large , and dynamics is faster .",
    "the mode coupling theory of the glass transition ( mct )  @xcite is able to describe the dynamics of bulk liquids in the supercooled region on approaching a crossover temperature @xmath1 . at @xmath1",
    "the system passes from a regime where ergodicity is attained through structural relaxations to a regime where this mechanism is frozen and only activated processes permit the exploration of the configurational space .",
    "@xmath1 can be estimated through experiments and computer simulations or predicted by the theory .    above @xmath1 the relaxation mechanism of the supercooled liquid",
    "can be described as mastered by the cage effect .",
    "nearest neighbors surround and trap the tagged particle forming a cage around it . when the cage relaxes , due to cooperative motions , the particle moves .",
    "mct translates this phenomenological description into a precise mathematical framework where , starting from the classical equation of motion for the density correlator @xmath2 , a retarded memory function is introduced . in the idealized version of mct hopping processes",
    "are neglected and the retarded non linear set of integro - differential equations can be solved analytically to the leading order in @xmath3 , deriving universal results for the density correlator . with these approximations @xmath1 is the temperature of structural arrest of the ideal system .",
    "the success of this theory is due to the fact that on approaching @xmath1 from above hopping processes can be neglected in many liquids and the predictions of the idealized version of mct hold .",
    "molecular dynamics studies of model liquids in restricted geometries intended to assess the applicability of mct can give an important contribution to the characterization of the glass transition scenario in confinement .",
    "in this field recent progresses have been done for water confined in a silica nano pore  @xcite and for confined thin polymer films  @xcite .",
    "we performed a molecular dynamic ( md ) study of the single particle dynamical properties of a lennard - jones binary mixture ( ljbm ) embedded in an off lattice matrix of soft spheres .",
    "the model considered represents a situation of strong confinement analogous to real silica xerogels  @xcite .",
    "the bulk phase of the chosen mixture is known to test most of the mct predicted features  @xcite .",
    "a brief report on some of our findings has been recently published @xcite .",
    "we present in this paper direct space quantities evaluated from md trajectories in order to define the range of validity of mct with respect to the bulk phase . in the next section",
    "we describe the model adopted and the details of the md simulations . in the third section",
    "we illustrate the radial pair distribution functions and the coordination numbers of the system .",

    "we verified that the results obtained do not depend on the specific choice of the disordered matrix by running md simulations for two other different configurations of the disordered matrix of soft spheres .",
    "both thermodynamics and dynamics appeared the same for the three systems , in particular deviations among the diffusion coefficients extracted at given temperatures from the msd of different configurations are within @xmath22% .",

    "the estimate has been carried out through the voronoi tessellation .",

    "no indications of phase separation appear upon supercooling either .",
    "the latter phenomenon would in fact result in a substantial decrease of the area of the first peak , @xmath25 , of the @xmath26 , which we do not observe in our system .",
    "on lowering temperature the peaks sharpen and enhance more than in the bulk due to the strong packing induced by the soft spheres .",
    "a clear element of distinction with respect to the bulk is the enhancement of intensity of the first @xmath27 peak , @xmath28 , as supercooling progresses . the same peak appeared instead reduced to a small shoulder for supercooled temperatures in the bulk .",
    "the functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 are characteristic of this confined system and are representative of the interaction between the confining soft spheres and the particles of the mixture .",

    "[ fig:6 ] a snapshot of the system for @xmath20 evidences this behavior .",
    "the fluctuations of the error bars in fig.[fig:7a ] also confirm this phenomenon .",

    "in the following we shall describe the temperature variations of the time dependent direct space quantities analyzed for our confined system upon supercooling , namely the msd , the van hove self correlation function and the non - gaussian parameter .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the msd can be used as a test of an mct prediction .",
    "the msd is in fact expected , as supercooling progresses , to develop a plateau at intermediate time scale , corresponding to the rattling of the particle in the cage .",
    "after the initial short time ballistic motion the particle enters the plateau whose extension in time enhances upon lowering temperature . after leaving the plateau region the brownian behaviour predicted for a simple liquid in a stable state is restored . from the slope of the late msd",

    "as shown in the previous section , in the confined case for lower temperatures b particles tend to avoid the interface of the soft spheres . as a consequence",
    "they remain confined in the inner part of the channels , surrounded by a particles , and this diminishes the accessible free volume lowering mobility below the one of a particles , see also fig.[fig:7a ] .    in fig .",

    "the range of validity of mct reported for the bulk is much wider , @xmath56 .",
    "the upper limit is generally due in bulk to the non - validity of the asymptotic expansion for too large values of @xmath57 .",
    "here we infer that a further decrease of this limit is due to the progressive b particles avoidance of the soft sphere interfaces upon supercooling . for",
    "the temperatures below the upper limit the peaks of g(r ) for ma and mb have in fact already stabilized , see fig.[fig:4 ] .",
    "the deviation observed at the two lowest temperatures is to be connected to the presence of hopping mechanisms , analogously to bulk liquids , as we will see in more detail when we illustrate the behaviour of the vhscf .",

    "we show @xmath59 at fixed times for three different temperatures . on this scale",
    "the correlators of a and b particles do not differ substantially . at high temperature",
    "the vhscf decays regularly as time increases as expected for a simple liquid .",
    "as supercooling progresses the system begins to display a new feature that is best evident for the lowest temperature .",
    "this feature consists in the clustering of the curves at intermediate times which is the signature of the caging of the particles .",
    "the zone where the peak value clusters is @xmath63 and corresponds to the zone in which the msd flattens .",

    "evidence is put on the region in which the peaks related to the presence of hopping appear.,width=302 ]    [ fig:11 ]    a behavior not present in the bulk can be observed for the lower temperatures by looking at the peak of the vhscf for times longer than the plateau region . in this temporal range",
    "the peak of the vhscf is expected , in the framework of mct , to shift to larger @xmath34 for large times .",
    "the absence of this shift in our confined mixture , as we shall see in the next picture , must be connected with an important hopping phenomenon able to restore diffusive motions when the cage is not jet dissolved .    in fig.[fig:11 ]",
    "we show a blow up of the tails of the curves of fig.[fig:10 ] . aside",
    "the previously cited cage peak , we note the presence of a hopping peak around @xmath67 . this peak enhances for late time and it is more pronounced for a particles than for b. in the bulk on approaching @xmath1 from above a hopping peak appears only for b particles . from the msd it is evident that our hopping phenomena can not be neglected at the two lowest temperatures , namely at @xmath68 . as a consequence",
    "these temperatures can not be accounted for a test of the mct in the region around the cage relaxation time , @xmath69 relaxation region .",
    "nevertheless these temperatures can be used to test the theory in the @xmath65-time region .",
    "in fact , see also ref.@xcite , hopping peaks do not affect curves in the time range of the clustering region .    for the a particle",
    "a second broader peak is visible in fig.[fig:11 ] .",
    "this peak is also connected to the presence of hopping .",
    "the two hopping peaks correspond to the first and second peak of the @xmath70 , see fig.[fig:5 ] , meaning that there are some privileged position for the atoms to be reached and that those atoms that reached these positions have traveled more than the average .",
    "similar , the hopping peak of the b vhscf corresponds to the first peak of the @xmath27 . hopping phenomena",
    "are connected with the existence of dynamical heterogeneities in supercooled liquids @xcite . in confinement",
    "they appear to have above @xmath1 a more important role than in the bulk .",
    "dynamical heterogeneities are also known to cause a non gaussianity of atomic displacements .",
    "we evaluated the first non - gaussian parameter ( ngp ) , that works as a quantifier of the degree of non - gaussianity .",
    "this parameter is defined @xcite in three dimension as @xmath71        [ fig:12 ]    this quantity calculated for our system is reported in fig.[fig:12 ] .",
    "also for this parameter we have marked differences with respect to the bulk that reflect the different weight of the hopping processes in the two cases . in the bulk",
    "the ngp of a and b particles were different and never exceeded the values of 2 for a particles ( no hopping above @xmath1 ) and 3.2 for b particles . here instead we have similar ngp for a and b particles and the value grows enormously as we supercool .",
    "for the last temperature investigated the peak is around 5 .",
    "we found no relation between the peak positions and mct power law of eq.[pwl ] as it was found for example in bulk water @xcite and the curves of the confined ngp do not appear to follow a master curve before the maximum as found in bulk liquids @xcite .",
    "the trend of the ngp of bulk and confined mixture depicts a scenario in which mct behaviour causes a mild deviation from gaussianity .",
    "the peak is around 2 when close to @xmath1  @xcite , its position shifts substantially upon supercooling and the ngp follows a master curve in the temporal region before the peaks .",
    "hopping appears to cause a marked deviation from gaussianity instead , leading to a disappearance both of the mct master curve and of the shift of the peaks upon supercooling .",
    "we presented an md study of a ljbm confined in a disordered array of soft spheres .",
    "the direct space quantities have been analyzed upon supercooling for a test of the mct behaviour .",
    "two main differences with respect to the bulk mixture appear due to confinement .",
    "the @xmath72 have evidenced that smaller b particles tend to avoid interfaces at low t and correspondingly their diffusion coefficient becomes lower than that of the a particles .",
    "hopping processes are present also for a particle above @xmath1 as shown in the vhscf .    not obviously",
    ", these differences do not prevent the mct asymptotic predictions from holding for this mixture also in this kind of confinement .",
    "the range of validity of mct in the region of the @xmath69 relaxation is however much more limited .",
    "the range of the bulk @xcite is @xmath56 against the @xmath55 found in our confined model .",
    "disturbances in the dynamical behaviour of the bulk introduced by a different type of confinement are also reported to lead to a complete disappearance of mct  @xcite .",
    "power law fit to the diffusion coefficient extracted from the slope of the msd give an estimate of @xmath47 for both species and @xmath48 for a particles and @xmath49 for b particles in agreement with mct that states that these quantities should be the same for both a and b particles .",
    "the values of the bulk extracted from d in literature are @xcite @xmath73 for both species and @xmath74 for a particles and @xmath75 for b particles .",
    "the exponents @xmath76 appear similar while we have a reduction of @xmath1 upon confinement .",
    "a complete test of the correlators in the q space will be presented in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "acceleration of dynamics in presence of repulsive confinement is expected @xcite based on the fact that in confinement the cooperative rearranging region can not grow beyond the size of the system . in the case of an attractive interaction this effect might superpose to the often severe slowing down caused by the substrate to the closest layers of the liquid@xcite .    in the present work we have considered a much more complex system than the bulk .",
    "therefore the fact the mct could be used in this context as an unifying theoretical approach is highly relevant as a guideline for the systematic study of the important phenomenology of confined and interfacial liquids .",
