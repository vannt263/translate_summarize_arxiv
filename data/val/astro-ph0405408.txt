    "supernovae ( sne ) have most probably been observed since the dawn of astronomy .",
    "the earliest known surviving record of a supernova was made in the eleventh century by ancient chinese astronomers ( see @xcite for the details of these early observations ) , but the modern study of sne began with baade and zwicky in the 1930 s when they realised sne are more luminous and rarer than the more common novae .",
    "the high luminosities and broad spectral lines led them to conclude that sne are extreme explosions , the result of a dying star collapsing to a neutron star .",
    "this basic model still holds .",
    "sixty - five  years of work has vastly increased our understanding but many questions about sne remain unanswered .",
    "a core - collapse sn occurs once a star has a core ( usually of iron group elements ) that can not be supported by any further nuclear fusion reactions or electron degeneracy pressure .",
    "this leads to the core collapsing to a neutron star or black hole . in the process",
    "it releases a large flux of neutrinos that interact weakly with the surrounding stellar envelope depositing a large amount of energy ( @xmath0 ) that can drive the star to explode . in massive cores supported by electron degeneracy pressure core - collapse",
    "can be initiated by electron capture onto nuclei .",
    "important questions are , ` which stars give rise to which sne and leave which type of compact remnant ? ' the answers will provide a test of stellar evolution theory , give information for galactic chemical evolution and predict sne birth rates and remnant populations . to solve these questions",
    "we must use our understanding of stellar evolution to model stars up to the point at which they become sne .",
    "three main factors affect the answer , the initial mass and metallicity of the star and mass - loss ( or mass - gain in some binary systems ) during its lifetime .",
    "@xcite , using the models described in @xcite , have considered these factors and answered some of our questions .",
    "while their study is informative , it lacks an accurate metallicity scale with only three metallicities studied @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "they only investigate a single mass - loss scheme , do not investigate the lowest mass for a star to become a sn nor describe the sn progenitors .",
    "these factors limit comparison with observations . in this paper",
    "we expand upon their work and add details on the progenitors of sne .",
    "these details are important for surveys of progenitors now underway by various groups , @xcite and @xcite .    from the literature",
    "we see that there are a variety of mass - loss schemes in use .",
    "we have compared a number of these and present a useful parameterisation . within our study",
    "we have found many regions of interest , wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , red giants ( rg ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars .",
    "their relative abundance , dependent on the initial mass function , and luminosity are of key interest as well as whether they do achieve the conditions to undergo core collapse .",
    "we have compared our results with observations of the known progenitors to date . in a few years",
    "there will hopefully be enough known progenitors to be able to fully test our predictions .",
    "we have used the cambridge stars stellar evolution code originally developed by @xcite and updated most recently by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "further details can be found at the code s home page ( http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath4stars ) . in this work",
    "we use 21 zero - age main - sequence models that have masses from @xmath5 to @xmath6 with a uniform composition determined by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass fraction of hydrogen , @xmath10 that of helium and @xmath11 is the initial metallicity .",
    "it takes values from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , equivalent to @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "the masses and metallicities used are shown on the axes of figure 1 .",
    "the models are evolved with a mixing length parameter @xmath16 in the formalism of @xcite .",
    "this value gives a good fit to a realistic solar model @xcite .",
    "we have also created maps with alternate compositions : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 . with constant hydrogen abundance the variation with metallicity",
    "is accentuated .",
    "for example 2nd dredge - up occurs at higher masses with increasing metallicity than we find below .",
    "changing the primordial hydrogen abundance from 0.75 to 0.76 as in the second case only produces small changes to our results .      at the time of @xcite only six composition variables were modelled .",
    "we have extended this to eight : h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg and si . we have also updated the reaction rates according to the nacre collaboration @xcite , replacing a number of those originally taken from @xcite .",
    "we have further updated the reaction network to follow the later stages of burning although we encounter numerical difficulties at the onset of neon and oxygen burning because these reactions occur at a much more rapid pace than the previous evolution with timescales of a year and below . during these burning stages",
    "the envelope is only affected to a small degree since @xmath21 .",
    "therefore we use models after core carbon burning to estimate the details of progenitors .",
    "we have confirmed from models that do experience a neon burning phase that the late stages of evolution are rapid and have a negligible effect on the final observable state of the progenitor .",
    "we use the updated tables of @xcite that accurately follow the opacity variation owing to the he / c / o ratio changes during evolution by including all the tables available from the opal project @xcite .",
    "we found important differences in the structure of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars and so we are able to model these stars with increased accuracy .",
    "convective mixing is modelled simultaneously with the structure with a diffusion equation that allows us to correctly follow stable semi - convection .",
    "our convective overshooting is not parameterised by a fixed fraction of the pressure scale height , @xmath22 .",
    "instead we modify the classical schwarzschild criterion for instability , normally expressed as @xmath23 for convective instability to occur , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radiative and adiabatic gradients respectively .",
    "to include overshooting we alter this condition to @xmath26 where @xmath27 @xmath28 is the ratio of radiation to gas pressure and @xmath29 is the overshooting parameter that we vary to include convective overshooting or to remove it .",
    "further details of the inclusion of this scheme in the eggleton code can be found in @xcite .",
    "they found from fitting models to eclipsing binaries @xmath29 to be @xmath30 .",
    "a similar trend was confirmed with a large pool of binaries in @xcite .",
    "this leads to overshooting lengths @xmath31 between @xmath32 and @xmath33 in stars of mass range @xmath34 to @xmath35 for more massive stars the overshooting length remains around @xmath36 .",
    "another way of quantifying the effect of overshooting is to measure the mass of the convective core of a zams model . for the @xmath37 star the mass over which mixing occurs grows from @xmath38 to @xmath39 , for a @xmath40 star",
    "the growth is from @xmath41 to @xmath42 and for a @xmath43 star from @xmath44 to @xmath45 .    in our calculations we use @xmath46 to include convective overshooting and set it to zero to remove overshooting .",
    "the amount of overshooting affects the core mass during evolution .",
    "this affects the nature of the remnants and also the mass of stars that undergo second - dredge up .",
    "the extra mixing owing to convective overshooting can be considered to mimic any mixing process such as rotation or gravity wave mixing , not just convective overshooting . for a review of the various extra mixing processes and the possible anomalies of stellar evolution they could resolve see @xcite .",
    "mass - loss modifies the evolution of a star by affecting the surface conditions and the total mass of the star . while theoretical mass - loss rates do exist ( vink , de koter & lamers 2000 , 2001 ) it is sensible to use empirical mass - loss rates if we aim to model what is observed .",
    "we have tested the theoretical rates of vink et al . and found the results agree well with those with empirical mass - loss rates .",
    "we divide our mass - loss rates into two main categories those for wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , that have lost their hydrogen envelope , and pre - wr or hydrogen - rich evolution . the nature of mass loss changes once the hydrogen envelope has been removed and observations show quite different mass - loss rates .",
    "wr stars have greater mass loss than an ob star of the same luminosity .",
    "the mechanism for mass loss in ob stars is radiatively driven winds .",
    "the wr star mechanism is not known for certain .",
    "it could be driven by radiation , pulsations or opacity @xcite .",
    "our resultant maps are strongly dependent on the mass - loss prescription .",
    "we have made a number of grids using prescriptions similar to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for our main maps",
    "we have adopted the prescription below , they are essentially the nl rates from @xcite but with a modification at low metallicity ( @xmath47 ) as detailed below . in section 5.1",
    "we present detailed comparison of the different mass - loss prescriptions we have tested .",
    "we use the mass - loss rates of @xcite , here after jnh , except for a small region at low metallicity and high stellar masses detailed below .",
    "the jnh rates are old and complex but considered to be the most accurate @xcite .",
    "the rates are dependent on surface luminosity and temperature and are derived from a large pool of observations .",
    "we apply the commonly adopted scaling with metallicity of @xmath48 as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this scaling arises from the assumption that stellar winds are line driven and with lower surface opacity at lower metallicity there are weaker winds .",
    "however while there is agreement that mass - loss scales in this form there is a range of suggested values for the exponent . we have tested the sensitivity to changes in this scaling by producing a grid with @xmath49 and higher values for the exponent ( up to 0.69 suggested by vink et al .",
    "as expected a larger exponent increases variation with metallicity : the type ii / ibc sn boundary varies with metallicity to a greater degree .",
    "previous authors have commonly assumed that this scaling applies at all stages of evolution even though there is some evidence that it varies with spectral type .",
    "this seems likely because the exponent assumes the winds are line driven while mass loss from giants is driven by some quite different unestablished mechanism .",
    "if we do not scale the mass loss for giant stars ( @xmath50 ) the result is that the minimum initial mass for wr star formation decreases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "this is contrary to other results . in another test",
    "we used an exponent of 0.5 for all stars except hot ob stars ( @xmath51 ) where we used an exponent of 0.7 .",
    "this produces results very similar to those of our preferred results using 0.5 for all stars .",
    "we encounter problems scaling the jnh rates when @xmath52 for the highest mass stars ( @xmath53 when @xmath54 and @xmath55 when @xmath56 ) .",
    "the stellar parameters are outside of the region covered by jnh . using simple extrapolation the mass - loss rate drops to very small values and leads to strange structure over the map .",
    "there is still a minimum mass for ibc stars but some of the stars more massive than this minimum do not lose all their hydrogen before sne . the problem can be seen in figure [ sneborders ] where with the jnh rates at low metallicity the minimum mass for ibc sne decreases with decreasing metallicity .",
    "this is because the nature of first dredge - up differs in these stars and complicates the mass - loss history . however ,",
    "if we replace the jnh rates with those of @xcite ( nj ) which are based on the same set of observational data but are expressed more simply a smoother structure is obtain .",
    "all the stars above the minimum ibc sn mass do undergo type ibc sne .",
    "we also find that none of our models at @xmath56 undergo type ibc sne .",
    "we do not use the theoretical rates of vink et al . because they do not extend down to these low metallicities .",
    "we consider the rates of nj rather than jnh to be the best extrapolation method at the current time at low metallicity and high initial mass .",
    "we have also experimented with the low metallicity theoretical mass - loss rates of @xcite and find similar results .",
    "wr evolution begins just before the hydrogen envelope is completely removed from the star .",
    "the stages of evolution run in the sequence of wn , wc and wo . in each case",
    "a particular element dominates in the emission spectrum , nitrogen , carbon or oxygen respectively .",
    "however the definition of when a model enters each stage is arbitrary .",
    "we use those defined in @xcite .",
    "* wn : when @xmath57 and @xmath58 . *",
    "wc : when @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "* wo : when @xmath59 and @xmath61 .    during wn and",
    "wc evolution we use the rates of @xcite that depend on luminosity and surface abundance they find that the mass - loss rate depends strongly on composition as well as luminosity .",
    "this dependence gives lower mass - loss rates than the mass - dependent rates of @xcite and the mass - dependant rates that @xcite also derive .",
    "we have tested both sets of mass - dependant rates and find that they lead to extreme mass loss from wr stars at and above solar metallicity and lead to the remnant becoming a white dwarf .",
    "our preferred rates are therefore the main @xcite rates .",
    "one straightforward test of this mass - loss prescription is to compare the number ratios of wr stars to o stars , and the wr subtype ratios . @xcite",
    "performed this test in detail and found good agreement to observed ratios .",
    "the one exception was the wn / wr ratio with the theoretical value being too low .",
    "there are a number of plausible reasons for this such as binaries affecting mass - loss and misclassification of some wn stars due to changing spectral features as metallicity changes .",
    "there are two main types of sne those without hydrogen in their spectra , type i , and those with hydrogen in their spectra , type ii .",
    "type i progenitors have lost their hydrogen envelopes and are white dwarfs or wr stars , while type ii progenitors have retained their hydrogen envelopes .",
    "this gives us a basic method to discriminate between them .      for a star with a model at the end of core carbon burning",
    "we say it will become a type ii sne if there is any hydrogen in its envelope .",
    "further more we know observationally that type iip sne have retained a good proportion of their original hydrogen .",
    "this hydrogen leads to the light curve following a plateau phase powered by a moving hydrogen ionization front .",
    "type iil sne only retain a small fraction of their hydrogen as the light curve decays linearly .",
    "we adopt the value of @xcite with type iip sne occurring until the mass of hydrogen in the star drops below @xmath62 when type iil sne occur .",
    "type i sne are divided into types ia , ib and ic .",
    "sne ia are extremely bright events thought to be the explosive carbon burning of a degenerate white dwarf that has reached the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath63 ) by accretion ; this is not a core collapse event",
    ". however types ib and ic are core - collapse sne in wr stars that have lost their hydrogen envelopes in a wind or by binary interaction .",
    "they are discriminated by the presence or absence of helium lines in the spectrum .",
    "however the differentiation between models that are type ib or ic is not obvious so we will label them as ibc .",
    "all of our progenitors still retain some helium and the loss of this final layer is likely to depend on the very end phase of evolution and the explosion itself .",
    "we also adopt from @xcite a method of determining the strength of a type ibc sn .",
    "this will allow us to quantify the number of sne that have no observable display and are thus unseen .",
    "this allows us to estimate ratios of type ii to type ibc sne .",
    "the largest progenitors are thought to give no display because the core is so massive that even with a large explosion energy nothing escapes the forming black hole .",
    "the exception would be if a jet driven sne occured that makes a black hole and produces an observable display @xcite .",
    "these ranges are taken from @xcite and are similar to those used for determining the supernovae remnant ( see next section ) .",
    "* @xmath64 , no display . * @xmath65 , faint sn . * @xmath66 , possibly faint sn . * @xmath67 , bright sn .",
    "determination of the remnant formed at the heart of a sn is a black art .",
    "the physics is extreme and poorly understood .",
    "however there are many prescriptions which rely on the conjecture that a more massive core leads to a more massive remnant .",
    "we consider here three types of stellar remnant : white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes .",
    "white dwarfs come in three flavours .",
    "they can be made of helium ( a hewd ) , a mixture of carbon and oxygen ( a cowd ) or a mixture of oxygen and neon with some sodium and magnesium ( an onewd ) .",
    "hewds are formed by very low mass stars or more probably in binary stars and are not of interest to us here .",
    "cowds are also not formed in sne but are the remnant cores of stars that lose their envelopes on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . at solar metallicity stars in the mass range @xmath68 to @xmath69 ( no convective overshooting )",
    "produce a cowd while larger stars , up to @xmath70 develop an one core before the agb .",
    "some of these lose their envelope and form an onewd .",
    "the most massive undergo a sn driven by electron capture on to magnesium .",
    "the dividing line between these two is of great interest but is somewhat uncertain and depends on the mass - loss rate and the details of the thermal pulses in agb stars .",
    "from our models we decide that stars with cores that grow by thermal pulses after 2nd dredge - up form cowds or onewds .",
    "this corresponds to a co core mass @xmath71 after 2nd dredge - up .",
    "all other stars undergo a sn and form a neutron star or black hole . to distinguish between neutron stars and black holes there are a number of different prescriptions .",
    "we compare that of @xcite with ours .",
    "@xcite use a simple system based on the helium core mass at the end stage of evolution .",
    "this is useful because the helium burning life - time is slower than for the later stages of burning so the core mass increases by only a small amount in the late burning stages .",
    "however the method relies on setting the values for different remnants by using simulations of sne .",
    "the values used are :    * neutron star : @xmath72 . *",
    "( by fall back ) : @xmath73 . * black hole ( directly ) : @xmath64 .",
    "these values are based on the sn models of @xcite . by using this scheme we can compare directly with @xcite .",
    "we should also note that sn that form a black hole directly also have no display . while those sn forming black holes by fall",
    "back will be faint . unless a jet driven sne occurs producing a black hole and an observable display .",
    "we use a core mass defined by the binding energy of the star .",
    "we assume a neutron star is formed at the centre of the star after core collapse of mass @xmath74 .",
    "this produces about @xmath75 of energy from the release of gravitational binding energy in neutron star formation .",
    "we then assume a hundredth of this energy is transferred into the envelope by some unknown mechanism .",
    "the current suggestion is the transfer occurs via neutrinos released from forming the proto - neutron star that are thermalised within the envelope or dense outer parts of the core .",
    "we integrate the binding energy of the star from the surface towards the centre until we reach @xmath76 .",
    "the envelope outside this region is ejected with the remaining amount forming the remnant .",
    "@xmath77    if we have a @xmath78 it is a black hole .",
    "the advantage of this method is that we are able to estimate the remnant masses and ejected masses quickly for large numbers of models .",
    "the resulting minimum mass for a black hole is similar to that from the he core mass method .",
    "however these remnant masses are at best a lower bound as we use a very simple model for a complex event .",
    "to demonstrate the effects of the main mass - loss prescriptions in use we evolve three stars at solar metallicity with six different mass - loss schemes .",
    "the prescriptions are detailed in table [ tml ] .",
    ".the mass - loss prescriptions identifiers . jnh and nj",
    "are as described in the main text , nl is from @xcite and l from @xcite . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we find that our results generally agree with @xcite , although our maps vary less with metallicity because we apply jnh mass - loss rates rather than nj over most of the h - r diagram except for a small region at low metallicity and large initial mass .",
    "observational evidence does match well with our maps and we can also point out that the most common type of progenitors , red giants , should be like 2003gd , faint compared to the rarer more massive stars",
    ". therefore observations may find it difficult to find red progenitors unless some of those that undergo 2nd dredge - up do evolve to sn . in which case there will be a population of very luminous red progenitors that have not been observed to date .",
    "we would like to thank the referee alexander heger for his helpful comments , stephen smartt for an observers view and philipp podsiadlowski for helpful comments .",
    "jje would like to thank pparc for his funding .",
    "cat would like to thank churchill college for his fellowship .",
