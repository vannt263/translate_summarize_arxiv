    "the theory of the canonical quantum gravity is based on the wheeler - dewitt equation and traces back to 1967 @xcite .",
    "there are many methods treating the canonical quantum gravity .",
    "for example hartle and hawking @xcite considered a mini - superspace model . a loop approach to the canonical quantization",
    "was presented by ashtekar and collaborators @xcite@xcite@xcite . or there are string quantum cosmology @xcite . in both schemes the difficulties with the wheeler - dewitt equation seams to remain . and only the homogeneous spacetimes can be quantized , while inhomogeneous spacetimes can not yet quantized completely .",
    "so we should try to remove or bypass the difficulties of the wheeler - dewitt equation .    in this paper",
    ", we show a technical method to solve the wheeler - dewitt equation , which we call up - to - down method .",
    "the up - to - down method consists of the following steps .",
    "first we add another dimension as an external time to the usual 4-dimensional metrics and create an enlarged hilbert space which has support of the spacetime metrics , and then we reduce this quantum state to the physical 4-dimensional state , we can obtain the additional constraint to simplify the usual wheeler - dewitt equation i.e. we use static restriction in a quantum gravity .",
    "we show how this technique useful to the theories of canonical quantum gravity . the same method , however does not work for klein - gordon systems .",
    "the strength of our method in the quantum gravity is shown by considering of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "there is no idea of the statics in the quantum gravity .",
    "so our method is strong tool to solve the static wheeler - dewitt equation or usual wheeler - dewitt equation .",
    "the consistency of the additional constraint is checked by analyzing solution in the enlarged hilbert space . in this paper",
    ", we consider the only vacuum spacetimes .    in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce the theory of the enlarged hilbert space with one additional dimension . and show how we can solve the hamiltonian constraint without fixing spacetime .",
    "this analysis is forward to the general discussion of the wheeler - dewitt equation . in subsection [ sec21 ]",
    "we introduce what we call the up - to - down method . in subsection [ sec22 ]",
    "we calculate general static solutions of the wheeler - dewitt equation .    in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we analyze three mini - superspace models as an explicit test of the practicality of the up - to - down method introduced in this paper .",
    "in particular in [ sec31 ] , we consider a friedmann universe model , and in subsection [ sec32 ] we study an off - orthogonal metric space model , and in subsection [ sec33 ] , we quantize a schwarzschild black hole . the black hole quantization is the main result achieved using the method introduced in this paper .",
    "section [ sec4 ] is devoted to a summary and discussion of the main results of our paper .",
    "in this section we explain in details what we call the up - to - down method .",
    "we analyze the auxiliary hilbert space and the original hilbert space and the projection .",
    "we justify the definition of the projection given in this paper .",
    "usually the hilbert space has the support of the 3-dimensional spacelike metrics .",
    "however , we expand it here to have the support of the 4-dimensional spacetime metrics .",
    "we start by introducing the additional dimension which is an external euclidean time with positive signature , and thus create an artificial enlarged hilbert space corresponding to this external time .",
    "we write such external dimension as @xmath0 .",
    "although there are many study of the higher dimensional spacetime , there is no physical meaning of @xmath0 .",
    "however , there is mathematical meaning of the another time . this idea based on the isham s quantum category .",

    "the action may be written as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the 5-dimensional ricci scalar , built from the usual 4-dimensional metric and external time components . rewriting the action by a 4 + 1 slicing of the 5-dimensional spacetime with lapse functionals given by the @xmath0 direction",

    ", the definition of the canonical momentum @xmath17 is different from the usual one .",
    "note in fact that the above state in @xmath16 is not the usual 5-dimensional quantum gravity state , because the 4 + 1 slicing is along the @xmath0 direction .",
    "this is why we call this hilbert space as artificial functional space .",
    "it is not defined by @xmath18 but by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the 5-dimensional lagrangian .",
    "in addition , we impose that 4-dimensional quantum gravity must be recovered from the above 5-dimensional action .",

    "@xmath24 is the usual extrinsic curvature defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is its trace , while @xmath27 is the 3-dimensional ricci scalar , and @xmath28 is the 3-dimensional covariant derivative .",
    "then we can define a subset of the auxiliary hilbert space on which the wave functional satisfies the usual 4-dimensional constraints . in order to relate the 4 and 5 dimensional spaces we should define projections . +   + _ definition 2 . _",
    "the subset of @xmath16 in which the five dimensional quantum state satisfies the extra constraints @xmath29 is called @xmath30 , where @xmath17 is the projection defined by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a functional space .",
    "and @xmath33 is the usual four dimensional quantum gravity state with the restriction that @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 stands for the 3-dimensional metric @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is defined by @xmath38 + although the measure of the projection may be zero , we can justify this projection in the next subsection .",
    "from now we consider the recovery of the 4-dimensional vacuum einstein gravity from the 5-dimensional wave functional .",
    "we consider 4-dimensional ricci scalar in the 4 + 1 hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the 4-dimensional ricci scalar is decomposed as @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the orthonormal vector of the time and @xmath17 is the contraction of momentum .",
    "then the modified hamiltonian constraint for the 5-dimensional quantum state which contains the 4-dimensional einstein gravity becomes , @xmath41 there is the theoretical branch in using the dirac constraint or hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraint . to use the dirac constraint at this point create the additional constraint which restrict the state to the static .",
    "finally , the simplified hamiltonian constraint in terms of the canonical representation becomes @xmath42 the magic constant factor @xmath43 for the term @xmath44 is a consequence of the choice of dimensions for @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 is the canonical momentum of the 4-dimensional metric @xmath47 , that is @xmath48 . and",
    "as we mentioned above , this canonical momentum is defined by the external time and not by the usual time .",

    "we can obtain following theorem : +   + we comment on the projections .",
    "although there are three projection , these operation is same .",

    "so we use the number 1,2,3 .",

    "<S> however we can expand this state to the state which has support on the space of the spacetime metrics with using additional constraint which requires the recovery of the 4-dimensional quantum gravity . enlarging the support of the state functional of the spacetime metrics </S>",
    "<S> , we can simply solve the usual wheeler - dewitt equation with the additional constraint . using this method </S>",
    "<S> we can solve some unsolved problems , such as the quantization of the black hole . </S>"
