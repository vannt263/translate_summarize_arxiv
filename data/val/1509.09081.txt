    "it has found numerous applications to problems as diverse as atomic - sized contacts@xcite , artificial atoms@xcite , josephson and majorana qubits@xcite , current sources@xcite and the quantum measurement of work@xcite . while standard @xmath0 theory@xcite considers circuits with constant voltage bias , more recent work@xcite has addressed nanostructures driven by alternating voltages inspired by nanoelectronic experiments in the ghz range and above@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend @xmath0 theory to tunnel junctions driven by alternating voltages .",
    "the modes of the environmental impedance , which play a crucial role for the conventional dcb effect , also cause significant effects in ac driven devices . since an external voltage is applied via the environmental impedance and not directly to the junction electrodes",

    "[ sec : two ] we recall the hamiltonian for standard dcb theory .",
    "the model hamiltonian is based on a representation of the environmental impedance as a collection of @xmath1 circuits .",
    "we also introduce the relevant current operators of the circuit . in the presence of a time - dependent voltage",
    "the tunneling current and the current flowing in the leads need to be distinguished .",
    "[ sec : three ] presents the perturbation theory in the tunneling hamiltonian , and we derive a general expression for the current flowing through the environmental impedance valid up to second order .",
    "we also give the unperturbed equations of motion of the circuit variables in the absence of tunneling .",
    "results on the time evolution of the mean values provide the connection between the microscopic parameters in the hamiltonian and phenomenological circuit theory .    due to the external driving , the unperturbed hamiltonian is time - dependent which complicates the evaluation of the perturbation - theoretical results",
    ". in particular , an applied time - dependent voltage also drives the modes of the electromagnetic environment so that standard techniques for ac driven circuits fail . in sec .  [",
    "sec : four ] we introduce a unitary transformation involving also the variables of the environmental modes which allows us to split off the time dependence arising from the external voltage .    in sec .",

    "sec : three ] for the average current flowing in the leads .",
    "the relevant averages over unperturbed quantities factorize into averages over the quasiparticles in the junction leads and averages over the degrees of freedom of the environmental hamiltonian .",
    "the quasiparticle averages are shown to reduce to those known from standard @xmath0 theory .",
    "the averages over the environmental degrees of freedom can be reduced to averages over operators depending only on the phase operator which is conjugate to the junction charge . employing the unitary transformation introduced previously and using the gaussian nature of phase fluctuations in an undriven circuit in the absence of tunneling , all quantities can be expressed in terms of the phase - phase correlation function familiar from standard dcb theory .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : six ] we study the average current in the presence of an applied voltage which is the sum of a constant dc part and a sinusoidal ac part .",
    "we determine the effective voltage across the tunnel junction which differs from the applied voltage because of a renormalization of the ac amplitude and a phase shift caused by the electromagnetic environment .",
    "the average current is also periodic and can be written as a fourier series .",
    "we obtain a general expression for the fourier coefficients . for the case of a constant applied voltage the results of standard @xmath0 theory are recovered .",
    "the time - averaged current in the presence of sinusoidal driving is derived and related to the dc current for constant driving .",
    "the higher harmonics of the current are also determined and shown to be influenced by the environmental impedance implying a novel dcb effect in the ac range .    finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : seven ] we present our conclusions and discuss the experimental observability of the predictions made in the previous sections .",
