    "one interesting and important topic in the secular evolution of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) is the so - called  bifurcation period \" @xmath2 , the initial binary orbital period which separates the formation of converging systems ( which evolve with decreasing orbital periods until the donor becomes degenerate ) from the diverging systems ( which evolve with increasing orbital periods until the donor star loses its envelope and a wide detached binary is formed ) @xcite .",
    "the first systematic investigations on the bifurcation period were done by @xcite . neglecting mass loss from the binary system and assuming angular momentum loss due to magnetic braking ( mb ; * ? ? ? * ) and gravitational radiation ( gr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these authors found that the bifurcation period is in the range @xmath3 day for lmxbs , and strongly depends on magnetic braking efficiency .",
    "@xcite included mass loss from the binary system and re - calculated the bifurcation period for two mass configurations ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 and two chemical compositions ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) .",
    "they pointed out that the mass loss from the binary system also plays an impotent role besides magnetic braking in determining the value of @xmath9 , while the chemical composition could only cause small change in @xmath2 .",
    "their bifurcation periods are @xmath10 day under conservative mass transfer , and @xmath11 times larger if moderate non - conservative mass transfer is assumed .",
    "@xcite found a bifurcation period around @xmath12 hr for a @xmath0 ns and a @xmath13 companion star , where they defined the bifurcation period as the orbital period when the roche lobe overflow just began , instead of the initial orbital period .",
    "@xcite also investigated the bifurcation period in lmxbs focusing the formation of ultra - compact x - ray binaries ( ucxbs ) , and specified the bifurcation period as  the longest initial period that leads to ucxbs within a hubble time ( @xmath14 gyr ) \" .",
    "ucxbs are bright x - ray sources with very short orbital periods ( @xmath15 h ) .",
    "the donor has to be a compact source like a white dwarf or a compact core of an evolved giant star to fit in the small roche lobe size .",
    "such sources may be formed through dynamical processes including stellar collisions and common envelop evolution @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario for the formation of such sources is through stable mass transfer in x - ray binaries with a low- or intermediate - mass donor star , which may explain the negative derivative of the 11-min source in ngc 6624 @xcite .",
    "it has been found that systems with initial orbital period just below the bifurcation period may form ucxbs @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the closer the initial orbital period to the bifurcation period from below , the smaller the minimum orbital period will be achieved .",
    "so the value of bifurcation period is crucial to understanding the formation of ucxbs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we make a systematic investigation on the bifurcation period for binary systems containing an ns with a main - sequence ( ms ) companion of mass from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "this work was motivated by recent progress in studies on mass and angular momentum loss mechanisms in lmxb evolution . in previous works",
    "the mb law originally postulated by @xcite and @xcite was usually adopted . however",
    ", this law predicts too fast spin - down of low - mass ms stars , contradicted with the observation of rapid rotators in young open clusters @xcite .",
    "obviously a modification of the mb law will have significant influence on the period evolution @xcite .",
    "additionally , there is strong evidence that during lmxb evolution the mass transfer is highly non - conservative .",
    "recent measurements of the masses of binary and millisecond pulsars indicate that a large fraction of the transferred mass may be lost from the systems rather accreted by the ns ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ) ns discovered in the globular cluster m5 @xcite may reflect a bimodal distribution of the initial masses of nss ( rather heavy accretion during the previous lmxb evolution ) , as already predicted by hydrodynamical core collapse simulations @xcite . ] . theoretically ,",
    "possible ways of mass loss have been suggested , including  evaporation \" of the donor @xcite or  radio - ejection \" of the transferred material @xcite due to the pulsar radiation / wind impinging on . in the latter case ,",
    "the matter is lost from the system at the inner lagrangian ( @xmath18 ) point , carrying away angular momentum and altering the period evolution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    " 2 briefly describes the stellar evolution code , the binary models , and the physical assumptions , especially the mb laws and the mass loss mechanisms .",
    "then we present the calculated results in  3 .",
    "our discussion and conclusions are given in  4 .",

    "we assume a solar chemical composition ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) , the ratio of mixing length to pressure scale height @xmath24 , and convective overshooting parameter to be @xmath25 .",
    "the opacity table is from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the effective radius of the roche lobe for the secondary is taken from @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mass ratio , and @xmath28 is the orbital separation .",
    "mass transfer rate via roche lobe overflow is evaluated as @xmath29yr@xmath30 , and we adopt @xmath31 in the calculations .      for lmxbs the timescale of tidal synchronization is much shorter than the characteristic evolutionary timescale of the binary , so we can assume that the spin of the secondary star and the binary orbital revolution are always synchronized .",
    "assuming rigid body rotation of the secondary star and neglecting the spin angular momentum of the neutron star , the total angular momentum of the binary system can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the moment of inertia of the secondary star , @xmath34 is the angular velocity of the binary .",
    "we consider three kinds of mechanisms of angular momentum loss .",
    "the first is the angular momentum loss due to gravitational radiation @xcite @xmath35 where c is the light speed .",
    "this mechanism is important only in very short period binary systems .",
    "the second angular momentum loss mechanism is for non - conservative mass transfer .",
    "we assume that a fraction @xmath36 of the transferred mass is accreted by the ns , and the remaining mass is ejected out of the binary as isotropic winds from the ns , carrying away the specific angular momentum of the ns , @xmath37 in our numerical calculations we have set @xmath38 .",
    "alternatively , if the ns is spun up to be a millisecond pulsar , its radiation pressure may be strong enough to halt the transferred matter at the @xmath18 point and quench the accretion .",
    "this `` radio ejection '' may cause almost all the matter from the secondary to be lost from the binary @xcite .",
    "the corresponding rate of angular momentum loss is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the distance from the @xmath18 point to the center of mass of the binary system .",
    "the third angular momentum loss mechanism is mb . for a low - mass ms star with deep convection zone ,",
    "stellar winds which are magnetically coupled with the star can decelerate the stellar spin efficiently , thus carrying away the orbital angular momentum because of tidal synchronization .",
    "the widely used formula for such mb effect was postulated by @xcite and @xcite as @xmath41 however , observations of rapid rotators in young open clusters suggest a modification of the mb law at high rotation rate @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 g@xmath44s @xcite , @xmath45 is the critical angular velocity at which the angular momentum loss rate reaches a saturated state , given by @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the global turnover timescales for the convective envelope of the sun at its current age and of the secondary star at age @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "they can be calculated by integrating the inverse local convective velocity over the surface convective envelope @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the radial distance from the center of the star to the bottom of the surface convective envelope , and @xmath52 is the local convective velocity from mixing - length theory @xcite .",
    "our calculation gives @xmath53 d , slightly larger than @xmath54 d in @xcite , but consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for the discussion of a possible reason for different values of @xmath47 calculated .",
    "following the suggestion of @xcite , we also add an ad hoc factor @xmath55 in eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , where @xmath56 is the mass fraction of the surface convective envelop , to reduce the mb effect when the convective envelope becomes too small .      to examine the influence of mass and angular momentum loss mechanisms on the period evolution ,",
    "we construct four models with various mass and angular momentum loss combinations : ( 1 ) model 1 - conservative mass transfer with traditional mb law ( eq .  [ 6 ] ) ; ( 2 ) model 2 - conservative mass transfer with saturated mb law ( eq .",
    "[ 7 ] ) ; ( 3 ) model 3 - non - conservative mass transfer with mass loss from @xmath18 point ( eq .  [ 5 ] ) and saturated mb law ( eq .  [ 7 ] ) ; and ( 4 ) model 4 - non - conservative mass transfer with mass loss from the ns ( eq .  [ 4 ] ) and saturated mb law ( eq .  [ 7 ] ) . in all the four models ,",
    "the initial ns mass is set to be @xmath57 , and the initial mass of the secondary @xmath58 ranges from 0.5 to @xmath59 .",
    "throughout this paper we define the bifurcation period @xmath2 as the initial binary orbital period @xmath60 with a zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) companion star that separates converging from diverging systems .",
    "we use @xmath61 to denote the final orbital period after the mass transfer .",
    "another definition of the bifurcation period used by @xcite is the orbital period when the roche lobe overflow just begins , which is expressed as @xmath62 in this paper .",
    "the results of the bifurcation periods for the four models described in  2.3 are summarized in fig .",
    "[ bifur ] and table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "we also draw the minimum initial period @xmath63 that corresponds to a lobe - filling zams donor star in fig .",
    "[ bifur ] .",
    "several features are noted for the bifurcation periods in fig .",
    "[ bifur ] .",
    "first , the bifurcation periods for all the four models decrease with increasing initial secondary mass from @xmath16 to @xmath64 .",
    "second , in models with saturated mb , there exists an upper limit of the initial secondary mass , beyond which no bifurcation period exists .",
    "this upper limit is in the range @xmath65 for model 3 , and @xmath66 for models 2 and 4 .",
    "third , comparing the bifurcation periods of model 1 with those of models @xmath67 indicates that the mb law plays the most important role in determining the values of the bifurcation periods : different mb laws can change the bifurcation periods by as much as @xmath68 , compared to @xmath69 ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) caused by different mass loss mechanisms .    in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we also present @xmath70 following @xcite . in model 1",
    ", we get @xmath71 hr for @xmath72 , which is in close line with the result of @xcite ( @xmath73 hr with @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) , where the difference could be explained as the difference between the metallicities we used .",
    "when we use saturated mb , @xmath70 decreases to @xmath76 hr .    according to the calculated orbital period evolutions",
    ", lmxbs can be classified into three categories : the diverging systems with @xmath77 , the converging systems with @xmath78 , and the parallel systems with @xmath79 . as an example",
    ", we present the calculated results for a @xmath80 binary in model 3 , to illustrate the three kinds of evolutionary sequences in fig .",
    "the corresponding bifurcation period is found to be @xmath81 day , and the initial orbital periods are chosen to be @xmath82 , @xmath81 , and @xmath83 days , which represent the converging , parallel , and diverging systems respectively .",
    "@xcite have emphasized the effect of mb on the evolution of lmxbs . comparing the results of models 1 and 2 presented in table  [ tab1 ]",
    ", we find that the bifurcation periods with traditional mb law are smaller ( larger ) than those with saturated mb law , when the initial secondary star mass @xmath84 is less ( larger ) than @xmath85 .",
    "our results suggest that mass loss also influences the value of @xmath2 , though in an less important way compared with mb .",
    "the bifurcation periods in non - conservative models 3 and 4 are lower than those in model 2 , in which conservative mass transfer has been assumed .",
    "this result is consistent with @xcite , but contradicted with @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to see whether an ucxb can form with saturated mb . for an lmxb with an initial orbital period below the bifurcation period ,",
    "mass transfer is mainly driven by the loss of angular momentum .",
    "the orbital period will decrease with the donor mass until a minimum period is reached .",
    "@xcite found a minimum period about @xmath86 min without mb , while @xcite showed that minimum orbital periods less than @xmath87 min could be reached for binaries with an initial orbital period very close to the bifurcation period if traditional mb is included , but in a time longer than the age of the universe .",
    "@xcite further investigated this ",
    "magnetic capture \" scenario for the formation of ucxbs .",
    "our calculations show that when the initial orbital period is close to the bifurcation period , ultra - compact systems ( @xmath88 h ) can indeed form with saturated mb , but also in a time longer than the age of the universe .",
    "for example , for an lmxb with @xmath89 and @xmath90 day in model 4 , a final period of @xmath91 min can be reached after @xmath92 gyr of mass transfer .",
    "all the works done by previous authors show that a more efficient angular momentum loss mechanism is required to produce ucxbs within @xmath14 gyr in this scenario .",
    "in this subsection we will try to use a semi - analytical method to understand our numerical results .",
    "first from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we have the following equation @xmath93 if we assume a fraction @xmath36 of the mass lost by the donor is accreted by the ns , i.e. , @xmath94 , we can write the period derivative as @xmath95 where @xmath96 our analysis is limited to binary evolution with @xmath97 . in this case",
    "it is clearly seen that mass transfer increases the orbital period and angular momentum loss decreases the orbital period .",
    "the bifurcation period is decided by the balance of these two factors .    keeping the orbital period unchanged ( i.e. @xmath98 ) ,",
    "we calculate the maximum mass transfer rates for orbital periods from @xmath99 day to @xmath100 day .",
    "this period interval covers the whole range of the bifurcation periods obtained in this work and in @xcite .",
    "we show the calculated mass transfer rates in fig .",
    "[ mdot2 ] , and find that they can be fitted by an approximate expression as @xmath101 then we calculate the mean mass transfer rates with constant @xmath102 and find that they lie between @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this means that if we use eq .",
    "( [ mdot ] ) to calculate @xmath70 , it will deviate no more than @xmath105 from the true value .",
    "the mean mass transfer rates here are calculated as follows .",
    "we fix the binary period @xmath102 in a constant value in our code , and then evolve the donor from its initial mass @xmath84 to the time when it loses half of its initial mass @xmath106 .",
    "this mass transfer process takes a time of @xmath107 .",
    "then we use @xmath108 as the mean @xmath109 for this period @xmath102 . if we assume that angular momentum loss is dominated by saturated mb when @xmath110 d , from eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( [ newmb ] ) we have @xmath111 here we adopt @xmath43 g@xmath44s @xcite , @xmath112 hz @xcite , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and replace the radius of the secondary @xmath115 with its roche lobe radius @xmath116 from eq .  ( 1 ) . combining eqs .",
    "( [ pdot])-(14 ) with @xmath117 we obtain @xmath118 hr for conservative mass transfer ( @xmath119 ) , and @xmath120 hr for non - conservative mass transfer ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "these values agree well with our numerical results ( @xmath121 hr ) .",
    "if the traditional mb law is used , similarly , from eq .  ( [ oldmb ] ) we get @xmath122 for @xmath113 and @xmath114 . combining eqs .",
    "( [ pdot])-(13 ) , ( 15 ) with @xmath117 we get @xmath123 hr for conservative mass transfer ( @xmath119 ) , which is about @xmath124 larger than @xmath125 hr from our numerical calculations and @xmath126 hr in @xcite .",
    "the main reason for this difference is that we use the constant value @xmath0 , @xmath13 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) , which should change with time to @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "this will decrease the coefficient in eq .",
    "( 12 ) and increase the value of @xmath70 by @xmath129 . for donor mass @xmath130",
    ", this will increase the value of @xmath70 by as much as @xmath131 .",
    "so it is better to use @xmath38 instead of @xmath119 for donors mass @xmath130 , which could yield more accurate results ( from our numerical results we find that the deviation of @xmath70 between conservative and non - conservative mass transfer is smaller than @xmath132 ) .",
    "using eq .",
    "( 11)-(15 ) , we also compute the semi - analytical results of @xmath70 for @xmath133 donors , and compare them with our numerical results of models 1 and 4 in fig .  4 , where the semi 4 results are calculated with @xmath38 . when we calculate the semi 1 results in fig .  4 , for the reasons mentioned above and below",
    ", we use @xmath119 for @xmath134 and @xmath38 for @xmath135 , where @xmath119 should be used .",
    "a few points need to be noted for the semi - analytical results in fig .",
    "firstly with the above mentioned equations it is impossible to compute the @xmath70 for binaries with @xmath136 under conservative mass transfer , since both terms in the right side of eq .",
    "( 11 ) are negative when @xmath119 and @xmath137 , and there will be no solutions for @xmath117 .",
    "we instead adopt @xmath38 when @xmath138 ( from our numerical results we find that the deviation of @xmath70 between conservative and non - conservative mass transfer is smaller than @xmath132 ) .",
    "secondly , eq .",
    "( 13 ) is derived only for @xmath13 donor star rather donors in the whole mass range ( @xmath139 ) , because in the latter case it is impossible to find a unified expression of the mass transfer rate like eq .",
    "( 13 ) . as seen in fig .  4",
    ", the difference between the semi - analytical and numerical results is generally smaller than @xmath124 except for donors smaller than @xmath85 .",
    "the reasons for the big discrepancies when @xmath140 are discussed in  4 .",
    "motivated by new ideas about mb and mass loss in lmxb evolution , we have made a systematic investigation on the bifurcation periods in binary models , taking into account different mb laws and mass loss mechanisms .",
    "we find that the strength of mb is the dominant factor in determining the value of bifurcation periods compared with mass loss .",
    "the stronger mb , the larger the bifurcation periods .",
    "this also results in an upper limit for the secondary masses beyond which no converging systems exist .    in our calculations",
    "we assume either fully conservative ( models 1 and 2 ) or non - conservative ( models 3 and 4 ) mass transfer to constrain the bifurcation period distribution in different mass transfer modes . from the expression of @xmath141",
    "we always have @xmath142 which means that non - conservative mass transfer contributes more to the increase of the orbital period than conservative mass transfer .",
    "this explains why we generally have a lower bifurcation period in non - conservative mass transfer models ( models 3 and 4 ) than in conservative mass transfer model ( model 2 ) under the same mb law .",
    "the real situation may lie between these two extreme cases . for binary systems with donors",
    "@xmath143 , it would take more that 13.7 gyr before mass transfer begins via roche lobe overflow .",
    "so the bifurcation period for these system seems meaningless , unless there exist some unknown mechanisms of loss of orbital angular momentum .    in our semi - analytical analysis in  3.3",
    "we use the condition @xmath144 to derive the values of @xmath70 .",
    "this expression seems different from @xmath145 , which is the original definition of bifurcation period .",
    "we argue here that these two expressions are roughly the same except for binaries with @xmath146 under conservative mass transfer ( @xmath119 ) , the reason of which has been given in  3.3 .",
    "for @xmath147 , we find that @xmath148 always scales with @xmath102 from eq .  (",
    "11 ) and ( 13)-(15 ) .",
    "this means that if initially @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) , @xmath148 will become larger ( smaller ) during the evolution , leading to monotonic increase ( decrease ) of the period , as seen in fig .",
    "so for these systems @xmath151 is approximately equivalent with @xmath152 .",
    "several rough assumptions in this semi - analytical method contribute to the discrepancies between the semi - analytical results and the numerical results in fig .  4 , especially for @xmath153 .",
    "first is the use of @xmath154 as the definition of @xmath70 , which may not work well sometimes .",
    "second is the use of eq .",
    "( 13 ) , which is most suitable for binaries with @xmath72 as pointed out in  3.3 .",
    "third is the assumption we made that magnetic braking law is the dominated mechanism for the angular momentum loss , while the true case is that the mb may not work sometimes ( for example when the convective envelop is too small ) .",
    "fourth is that we use a constant initial value of @xmath155 , @xmath84 for @xmath19 , @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( 12 ) and eq.(14)-(15 ) , while in the true case @xmath19 , @xmath20 should change with time .",
    "this will cause a big problem for @xmath119 when @xmath156 , which has been pointed out in  3.3 .",
    "fifth reason is the use of @xmath157 in eq .",
    "( 14 ) as the value of @xmath158 for all the donors ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath64 .",
    "at last we conclude that ( 1)@xmath159 is a fair definition of bifurcation period , and ( 2)the period evolution during the mass transfer phase is in first approximation sufficiently well described by the balance of mass transfer and angular momentum loss caused by mb . for these rough assumptions made in this semi - analytical method , its results agree with the numerical results only in the leading order .",
    "our numerical calculations show that there is an upper limit for the donor mass beyond which no converging systems will form .",
    "@xcite found that , in the case of @xmath160 , there is no converging system existing if @xmath161 , and concluded that for any given initial accretor mass there exists a maximum initial secondary mass for the formation of converging systems . from our calculations with @xmath162",
    ", we find an upper limit for the initial secondary mass @xmath163 between @xmath164 and @xmath165 under saturated mb .",
    "the reason is that for binaries with a ms donor of initial mass @xmath166 , the bifurcation period is shorter than the minimum zams period , so that these systems will diverge . for traditional mb ,",
    "this upper limit is @xmath167 , beyond the range of donor masses we adopt .",

    "<S> the bifurcation period in low - mass x - ray binaries is the initial orbital period which separates the formation of converging systems ( which evolve with decreasing orbital periods until the donor becomes degenerate ) from the diverging systems ( which evolve with increasing orbital periods until the donor star loses its envelope and a wide detached binary is formed ) . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate systematically the bifurcation periods of binary systems with a @xmath0 neutron star and a @xmath1 donor star , taking into account different kinds of magnetic braking and mass loss mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the saturated magnetic braking can considerably decrease the values of bifurcation period compared to the traditional magnetic braking , while the influence of mass loss mechanisms on bifurcation periods is quite weak . </S>",
    "<S> we also develop a semi - analytical method to compute the bifurcation period , the result of which agrees well with the numerical method in the leading order . </S>"
