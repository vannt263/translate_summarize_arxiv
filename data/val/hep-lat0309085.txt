    "lattice qcd has always been plagued by the fact that towards realistic quark masses the simulation costs increase drastically due to the large correlation lengths of the light states and the large lattice volumes that one employs in order to avoid finite - size ( fs ) effects .",
    "this difficulty has , in fact , prevented us until this day from carrying out simulations with truly physical parameters .",
    "instead one resorts to computations with several un - physically large quark masses in fs - effect - free volumes , followed by an extrapolation to the physical quark mass .",
    "however , the chiral extrapolation introduces uncertainties that can be reduced only by increasing the overlap of lattice simulations with chpt .",
    "it is thus inevitable to look out for feasible ways to obtain lattice results at light quark masses .",
    "current approaches like overlap , domain - wall or improved staggered fermions are still very costly , especially if one goes beyond the quenched approximation .",
    "faced with limited computer resources we therefore investigate the feasibility of an approach that restricts itself to the use of standard wilson fermions .",
    "the aim of the _ gral _ project is to carry out a systematic study of fs effects in the light hadron spectrum in the parameter regime accessible to us . with simulations on series of small to medium - sized lattice volumes ( at fixed coupling and quark mass , respectively ) we also want to address the issue of whether one can use formulae obtained from this investigation to extrapolate hadronic observables to the infinite volume .",
    "in 1983 m.  lscher published a universal field theoretic formula for the shift in the mass of a stable particle enclosed in a finite box  @xcite .",
    "the formula states for asymptotically large volumes that the fs mass - shift vanishes exponentially with increasing box size at a rate that depends on the particle considered and on the spectrum of light particles in the theory .",
    "if , in qcd , we consider a stable hadron in a box of size @xmath0 with periodic boundary conditions and sufficiently large ( euclidian ) time - extent @xmath1 , its mass @xmath2 becomes a universal function of @xmath3 ( where , at fixed @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) in the finite - volume continuum limit . since fs effects probe the system at large distances and are thus insensitive to the form and magnitude of the uv cutoff , this function is expected to hold also for finite lattice spacings . with the ( constant ) lo chiral expression for the @xmath6-@xmath6 forward scattering amplitude the relative mass - shift for the pion",
    "is given by @xmath7    if we assume , for simplicity , the pion - nucleon forward scattering amplitude to be constant , too , then the formula for the nucleon involves a term that is  up to low - energy constants  proportional to the one for the pion .",
    "in addition it contains a term proportional to @xmath8    on the other hand , in 1992 fukugita _",
    "et al . _ found a power - like @xmath9-dependence of the form @xmath10 in their data for the pion , rho and nucleon masses  @xcite .",
    "the usual explanation for the apparent discrepancy is that lscher s formula deals with asymptotically large lattice volumes where fs effects arise from a squeezing of the virtual pion cloud surrounding the hadron in a box with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast , fukugita _ et al .",
    "_  ascribe the power - like behaviour of their data to a squeezing of the hadron itself ( as it would occur for small lattice volumes ) . in this picture one",
    "expects a power - like dependence for sub - asymptotic lattice volumes that gradually changes into an exponential fall - off of the hadron masses towards larger box sizes .",

    "the asymptotic mass @xmath33 ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) obtained from the fit deviates less than 1% from @xmath22 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) at @xmath14 and lies thus well within the errors of @xmath22 ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",
    "we clearly see an exponential behaviour in our data for the light hadrons , as opposed to the @xmath37-dependence reported earlier by fukugita _",
