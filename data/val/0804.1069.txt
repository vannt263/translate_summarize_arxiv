    "to provide accurate observational constraints for pre - main sequence evolutionary models , and thereby improve our understanding of star - formation , it is crucial to measure as accurately as possible the properties ( age , mass , luminosity , etc . ) of individual young stars .",
    "the determination of most of these parameters , however , depends critically on the often poorly known distance to the object under consideration . while the average distance to nearby low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g.  taurus or @xmath0ophiuchus ) has been estimated to about 20% precision using indirect methods ( elias 1978a , b ; kenyon et al .",
    "1994 ; knude & hog 1998 ; bertout & genova 2006 ) , the line - of - sight depth of these regions is largely unknown , and accurate distances to individual objects are still missing .",
    "even the highly successful hipparchos mission ( perryman et al .  1997 ) did little to improve the situation ( bertout et al .",
    "1999 ) because young stars are still heavily embedded in their parental clouds and are , therefore , faint in the optical bands observed by hipparchos .",
    "low - mass young stars often generate non - thermal continuum emission produced by the interaction of free electrons with the intense magnetic fields that tend to exist near their surfaces ( e.g.feigelson & montmerle 1999 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field intensity and the electron energy are sufficient , the resulting compact radio emission can be detected with very long baseline interferometers ( vlbi e.g.andr et al .",
    "the relatively recent possibility of accurately calibrating the phase of vlbi observations of faint , compact radio sources using nearby quasars makes it possible to measure the absolute position of these objects ( or , more precisely , the angular offset between them and the calibrating quasar ) to better than a tenth of a milli - arcsecond ( brisken et al .",
    "2000 , 2002 ; loinard et al .  2005 , 2007 ; torres et al .  2007 ; xu et al .",
    "2006 ; hachisuka et al .",
    "2006 ; hirota et al .",
    "2007 ; sandstrom et al .  2007 ) .",
    "this level of precision is sufficient to constrain the trigonometric parallax of sources within a few hundred parsecs of the sun ( in particular of nearby young stars ) with a precision better than a few percents using multi - epoch vlbi observations . with this goal in mind",
    ", we have initiated a large project aimed at accurately measuring the trigonometric parallax of a sample of magnetically active young stars in the most prominent and often - studied northern star - forming regions within 1 kpc of the sun ( taurus , @xmath0ophiuchus , perseus , serpens , etc . ) using the 10-element very long baseline array ( vlba ) of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) . here",
    ", we will summarize the results obtained so far in taurus and ophiuchus .",
    "all the observations used here were obtained in the continuum at 3.6 cm ( 8.42 ghz ) with the _ very long baseline array _ ( vlba ) of the _ national radio astronomy observatory _ ( nrao ) .",
    "a total of 7 sources were studied so far : three in taurus ( t tau , hubble 4 , and hde  283572 ) , and four in ophiuchus ( s1 , doar21 , vssg14 , and wl5 ) . in all cases ,",
    "between 6 and 12 observations spread over 1.5 to 2 years were obtained .",
    "the data were edited and calibrated following the standard vlba procedures for phase - referenced observations ( see loinard et al .",
    "2007 , and torres et al .",
    "2007 for details ) .",
    "the displacement of the sources on the celestial sphere is the combination of their trigonometric parallax ( @xmath1 ) and their proper motions ( @xmath2 ) . for isolated sources ( such as hubble 4 , and hde  283572 in our case ) , it is common to consider linear and uniform proper motions , so the right ascension and the declination vary as a function of time @xmath3 as :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the coordinates of the source at a given reference epoch , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the components of the proper motion , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the projections over @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , of the parallactic ellipse .    for sources in multiple systems , however , the proper motions are affected by the gravitational influence of the other members of the system . as a consequence ,",
    "the motions are curved and accelerated , rather than linear and uniform . if the orbital period is long compared with the timespan covered by the observations ( as will be the case for t tau see loinard et al .",
    "2003 ) , it is sufficient to include a uniform acceleration in the fit .",
    "this leads to functions of the form :    .distances to the sources in taurus and ophiuchus [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the proper motions at a reference epoch , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the projections of the uniform acceleration ( see fig",
    ".  1 for a comparison between fits with and without acceleration terms ) .",
    "finally , if a source is a member of a multiple system whose orbital period is shorter than , or comparable with the timespan covered by the observations ( as will be the case for all ophiuchus sources ) , then a full keplerian fit is needed , but additionnal observations are required to properly constrain that fit .",
    "these observations are currently being obtained for all ophiuchus sources , but are not yet analyzed . as a consequence ,",
    "the fits presented bellow for the ophiuchus sources are based on eqs .",
    "[ uni1 ] and [ uni2 ] .",
    "the resulting uncertainties will be much larger than for the sources in taurus because the orbital motions generate an unmodelled scatter around the mean positions of the sources .",
    "these increased errors should disappear once we include the new observations , and perform a full keplerian fit .",
    "the distance to the seven sources studied here are given in tab .  1 .",
    "for the taurus sources , hipparchos parralaxes ( bertout et al .",
    "1999 ) , and/or estimates based on a modified convergent point method ( bertout & genova 2006 ) are available .",
    "our measurements are always consistent with these values , but are one to two orders of magnitude more accurate . only one other source in taurus ( v773 tau ; lestrade et al.1999 )",
    "has a vlbi - based parallax determination . taking the mean of that and our 3 measurements",
    ", we estimate the mean distance to the taurus cluster to be @xmath18 = 137 pc .",
    "the dispersion about that mean leads to a full width at half maximum depth of about 20 pc , comparable to the linear extent of taurus on the plane of the sky .",
    "traditionnaly assumed to be at a distance of 165 pc ( chini 1981 ) , ophiuchus has recently been proposed to be somewhat nearer , at 120 pc ( knude & hog 1998 ) .",
    "interestingly , two of our sources are consistent with the traditionnal value , but the other two are consistent with a distance of 120 pc . since ophiuchus is only a few parsecs across on the plane of the sky , it is very unlikely to be 40 pc deep .",
    "it is noteworthy that the two sources at about 120 pc ( s1 and doar21 ) are associated with the sub - condensation oph a , whereas the two sources at @xmath19 165 pc ( vssg14 and wl5 ) are associated with the condensation oph b ( see motte et al .",
    "1998 for an overview of the ophiuchus complex ) .",
    "thus , a plausible explanation of our results is that two physically unrelated star - forming regions are located along the line - of - sight toward ophiuchus .",
    "interestingly , knude & hog ( 1998 ) noticed an effect that would be consistent with this possibility in their analysis of extinction towards ophiuchus . while a clear extinction step was clearly visible at 120 pc",
    ", extinction was apparently extending up to about 160 pc .",
    "additional vlbi observations will be needed to confirm the existence of two regions of star - formation towards ophiuchus , and to investigate at which distance the other condensations in ophiuchus are located .",
    "the present results show that vlba observations of non - thermal sources associated with young stars have the potential to improve very significantly our knowledge of the space distribution of star - forming regions in the solar neighborod .",
    "indeed , the precision obtained by these measurements is even sufficient to probe the 3d structure of star - forming regions . coupled with pre - main sequence evolutionnary models , such information could be used to reconstruct the history of star - formation with individual regions ."
