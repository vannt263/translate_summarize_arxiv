    "@xcite recently announced the discovery of an astrometric companion to vb 10 , an ultra - cool dwarf with a mass of @xmath50.08 m@xmath6 . from a keplerian fit to the motion , they determined a mass of 6 m@xmath7 and a period of 270 d. thus vb 10 became the lowest mass star known to harbor a planetary companion .",
    "the mass ratio between vb 10 and its companion , @xmath013 , also is intriguing . a similar mass ratio for a solar - type star would make the companion a brown dwarf , but brown dwarfs as small separation companions to stars are quite rare .",
    "vb 10 is itself the secondary in a wide binary with v1428 aql , a m2.5 star @xcite . at a distance of 5.8 pc from the sun ,",
    "the 74  separation of this proper motion binary corresponds to a projected separation of 430 au .",
    "such low - mass stars have not been the target of intensive precision radial velocity ( prv ) monitoring because they have low visual fluxes and high stellar activity .",
    "for example , the dedicated harps m - dwarf planet search observes stars only brighter than v=14 and of moderate to low activity levels @xcite .",
    "vb 10 has v mag = 17.3 and is known to be a flare star @xcite .",
    "prv and lensing planet searches have so far found only 13 stars under 0.5 m@xmath6 hosting 18 planets , and of these , more than half have masses below 0.1 m@xmath7 .    despite the challenges , searches for planetary companions to low mass stars",
    "are of continuing interest .",
    "low - mass stars appear less likely to have lower mass stellar companions and less likely to harbor planets than solar - mass stars @xcite .",
    "when they do have companions , they tend to be stars of nearly equal mass to the primary @xcite .",
    "the mass function of planets orbiting m dwarfs , and how it differs from the planet mass function for higher - mass stars , provides a constraint on the planet formation mechanism(s ) in general . disks sufficiently massive to form jupiter - mass planets appear to be rare around brown dwarfs , whose disks generally look like lower mass versions of t tauri disks @xcite .",
    "high mass companions would have to form via a binary - like fragmentation mechanism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "thus how a 6 m@xmath7 planet could form around an @xmath080 m@xmath7 star and how common such high - mass ratio companions remain important questions @xcite .",
    "the reported planet s astrometric orbit predicts a radial velocity ( rv ) amplitude of at least 1 km s@xmath2 for a circular orbit and up to several km s@xmath2 for an eccentric orbit .",
    "this magnitude signal is detectable with ordinary rv measurements without requiring the adoption of precision techniques such as an iodine cell or simultaneous thorium reference .",
    "although several rv measurements of vb 10 exist in the literature before 2009 , it is difficult to combine the historical rvs ( see list in table 4 of @xcite ) , as each observation used different calibration techniques and/or rv standards that introduce zero - point offsets and the typical uncertainties are also large ( @xmath01.5 km  s@xmath2 ) .",
    "the most precise measurements in the literature were recently published by @xcite ( hereafter z09 ) , but provide only a `` hint of variability . ''",
    "these data did little to constrain the orbital parameters of the planet beyond what the astrometry had already done @xcite .    here , we present a more precise set of rv observations over 175 days ( or 65% of the reported orbital period )",
    ". we also present general techniques for joint fitting of astrometric and rv data and show how they can be used to constrain the orbit of the candidate planet .",
    "we acquired spectra at 7 epochs in 2009 with the mike spectrograph at the magellan clay telescope at las campanas observatory ( chile ) .",
    "we used the 0.35@xmath8 and the 0.5@xmath8 slits which produce a spectral resolution of @xmath545,000 and 35,000 , respectively , across the 4900  10000 range of the red chip .",
    "the seeing was in the range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 .",
    "these data were reduced using the facility pipeline @xcite .",
    "we also have in hand a single spectrum of vb 10 taken in 2006 using the hires @xcite ) on the keck i 10-m telescope .",
    "we used the 0.861@xmath8 slit to obtain a spectral resolution of @xmath11/@xmath12@xmath558,000 at @xmath13 .",
    "we used the gg475 order - blocking filter and the red cross - disperser to maximize throughput in the red orders .    to increase the phase coverage ,",
    "an additional spectrum was obtained using the espadons on the cfht 3.6-m telescope .",
    "espadons is fiber fed from the cassegrain to coud focus where the fiber image is projected onto a bowen - walraven slicer at the spectrograph entrance .",
    "espadons ` star+sky ' mode records the full spectrum over 40 grating orders covering 3700 to 10400  at a spectral resolution of @xmath11/@xmath12@xmath568,000 .",
    "the data were reduced using _",
    "libre esprit _ described in @xcite .",
    "each stellar exposure is bias - subtracted and flat - fielded for pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "after optimal extraction , the 1-d spectra are wavelength calibrated with a thorium - argon arc .",
    "to correct for instrumental drifts , we used the telluric molecular oxygen a band ( from 7620  7660  ) which aligns the mike spectra to 40 m  s@xmath2 , after which we corrected for the heliocentric velocity .",
    "consistency tests with the bluer oxygen band shows comparable values but with larger measurement error .",
    "the final spectra are of moderate s / n reaching @xmath5 25 per pixel at 8000  .",
    "each night , spectra were also taken of a m - dwarf rv standard , namely gj 699 ( barnard s star ; spt = m4v ) and/or gj 908 ( spt = m1v ) .    to measure vb  10 s rv ,",
    "we cross - correlated each of 9 orders between 7000 and 9000   ( excluding those with strong telluric absorption ) where vb 10 emits most of its optical light , with the spectrum of gj 699 and/or gj 908 taken on the same night using iraf s routine ( @xcite ) .",
    "both gj 699 and gj 908 have been monitored for planets for years and none has been found within the rv stability level of 0.1 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "here we use the systemic rvs published by a planet - search team @xcite : rv(gj 699 ) = 110.506 km  s@xmath2 and rv(gj 908 ) = 71.147 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the zero - point of the absolute rvs is uncertain at the 0.4 km  s@xmath2 level .",
    "we measured the rvs from the gaussian peak fitted to the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) of each order and adopt the average rv of all orders with a mean standard deviation of the individual measurements of 0.150  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the average of all our measurements is 36.02 km  s@xmath2 with a standard deviation of 0.25 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "an observing log with the measured rvs and uncertainties for vb 10 is shown in table  [ table_log ] .",
    "in this section , we reanalyze the original astrometric data to calculate the likelihood of astrometrically allowed solutions , and then combine the astrometry and rv data sets in a consistent framework to quantify how the new rv measurements constrain the possible orbits of the candidate signals observed in the astrometry of vb  10b .      the most popular method to look for periodicities in data",
    "is the so - called lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "a version adapted to deal with astrometric two - dimensional data developed by @xcite ( joint lomb scargle periodogram ) was implemented in the discovery paper of vb 10b @xcite .",
    "any method based on the lomb - scargle periodogram performs optimally only under an important implicit assumption : all other signals ( e.g. linear trend , an average offset , etc . )",
    "can be subtracted from the data without affecting the significance of the signal under investigation .",
    "this assumption does not hold for astrometry because the proper motion and the parallax are also a significant part of the signal and they typically correlate with the periodic motion of a planet ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we use instead a least - squares periodogram .",
    "the weighted least - squares solution is obtained by fitting all the free parameters in the model for a given period .",
    "the sum of the weighted residuals divided by @xmath14 is the so - called @xmath15 statistic .",
    "then , each @xmath16 of a given model with @xmath17 parameters , can be compared to the @xmath18 of the null hypothesis with @xmath19 free parameters by computing the power , @xmath20 , as @xmath21 where a large @xmath20 is interpreted as a very significant solution .",
    "the values of @xmath20 follow a fisher f - distribution with @xmath22 and @xmath23 degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "even if only noise is present , a periodogram will contain several peaks ( see * ? ? ? * as an example ) whose existence have to be considered in obtaining the probability of a spurious detection .",
    "assuming gaussian noise , the probability that a peak in the periodogram has a power higher than @xmath24 by chance is the so - called false alarm probability ( fap ) : @xmath25\\right)^m \\label{eq : faps}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the number of independent frequencies . in the case of uneven sampling",
    ", @xmath26 can be quite large and is roughly the number of periodogram peaks one could expect from a data set with only gaussian noise and the same cadence as the real observations .",
    "we adopt the recipe @xmath27 given in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec 2.2 ) , where @xmath28 is the time - span of the observations and @xmath29 is the minimum period searched .",
    "one still has to select @xmath29 arbitrarily . assuming a @xmath30 days , the astrometric data alone has @xmath31 , and the combination of astrometry and rvs has @xmath32 .    in our particular problem , the null hypothesis is the basic kinematic model with @xmath33 parameters : 2 coordinates , 2 proper motions , parallax and systemic rv . as a first approach ,",
    "our simplest non - null hypothesis considers circular orbits , astrometric data only and one rv measurement . for a given period , the number of free parameters is then @xmath34 : the 6 kinematic ones plus the four thiele innes elements @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the model is linear in all @xmath39 parameters , the power can be efficiently computed for many periods between @xmath40 days and @xmath41 days to obtain a familiar representation of the periodogram that we call a _ circular least - squares periodogram _ ( clp ) .",
    "the clp of the astrometric data , shown at top in figure  [ fig : periodogram ] , displays two obvious peaks : the reported one at 270 days @xcite and a more significant one at 49.9 days , both with high power and very low faps .    to find the full keplerian solution for both periods and estimate their faps ,",
    "we perform a least - squares periodogram sampling a grid of fixed eccentricity - period ( ep ) pairs and fitting all other parameters .",
    "for each ep pair @xmath17 is @xmath42 : the null - hypothesis ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) plus all the other keplerian elements : mass of the planet , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and the mean anomaly at the initial epoch @xmath52 ( see * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "we analyze both _",
    "astrometry only _ and _ astrometry+rvs_. the @xmath15 of the best fit solution is then used to obtain each fap as previously described .",
    "figure [ fig : periodogram ] shows the resulting color - coded faps for each eccentricity  period pair ( ep - map ) .",
    "a value of @xmath53 has been used to obtain the fap , and our result at 270  d qualitatively agrees with @xcite , however the more significant period is at @xmath050  d. for both periods , there are regions with fap@xmath541% spanning all possible eccentricities ( second row in figure [ fig : periodogram ] ) . the best fits and their @xmath15 per degree of freedom ( @xmath55 ) are summarized in table  [ tab : pars ] .",
    "the obtained results for the 270  d period are in agreement with those reported in the discovery paper by @xcite .",
    "the best fit solution for the 50  d period has mass @xmath56 m@xmath57 , which would be a very low mass brown dwarf .",
    "it is important to point out that the best fit inclination is close to @xmath58 ( edge on ) for both solutions .",
    "the uncertainties on the orbital parameters are quantified in sec  [ sec : mcmc ] .",
    "we now fit jointly for the best orbital solution to the astrometry and rvs .",
    "our campaign covered about 65% of the 270  d orbit .",
    "the standard deviation of all our rvs measurements is @xmath3 m s@xmath2 ( null hypothesis ) which is larger than the individual uncertainties in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "when we cross - correlate our standards , we measure a similar rms of 200 m s@xmath2 , which indicates that the difference is due to an uncontrolled or unmeasured systematic .",
    "the rms of the rvs for the best fit solution is @xmath4 m s@xmath2 , which is not statistically different from the rms of the null hypothesis .",
    "this is another indication that our measurements contain systematic errors at the level of @xmath59 m / s .",
    "despite of that , we use the nominal errors in the least - squares solution as the best estimates for the individual uncertainties we can provide . in figure [ fig : higheccfit ] , we show the best solutions to both signals including all the data .    for the 270  d period , our rv _ non detection _ can not exclude a small region of orbital solutions around @xmath60 with a fap between 1%5%  see figure  [ fig : periodogram ] , third row right panel .",
    "we now add the rvs measurements by z09 and solve for a joint solution . a zero - point offset between datasets",
    "is added as an additional free parameter .",
    "the combined rv measurements force the eccentricity to large values which apparently still provides a reasonable fit to the astrometry ( see top panels in figure [ fig : higheccfit ] ) .",
    "however , the faps are now all higher than @xmath39% ( figure  [ fig : periodogram ] , bottom right panel ) , which indicates that the signal can be barely distinguished from the noise fluctuations .",
    "the `` hint '' of detection in z09 based on one discrepant value at @xmath61 out of five can be due to random errors with a non negligible probability .",
    "for the 50  d period , there are still several orbits that provide a decent fit to the combined astrometry and the new rv data with a fap lower than 1% .",
    "these occupy a small space around the best joint solution , with @xmath62 ( see figure [ fig : periodogram ] , 3rd row , left panel ) and an inclination close to @xmath63 .",
    "large eccentricity causes the duration of fast rv variation to be very short ( and difficult to catch ) ; an inclination close to @xmath63 tends to suppress any rvs signal .",
    "such inclination is in apparent contradiction with the one obtained using the astrometry alone ( @xmath64 deg ) .",
    "the reason is the following : while the new fit to the astrometry forced by the rvs is much worse than the one obtained from the astrometry alone , such a solution still represents an improvement compared to the null hypothesis . adding z09 data to the fit increases the fap of the most likely solution to 2% , an eccentricity of @xmath65 and the inclination close to 0 ( see table  [ tab : pars ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the signal at 50  d is also spurious , even though it has slightly better chances of survival than the one at 270  d.      [ sec : mcmc ]    we adapt the method developed by @xcite to assess uncertainties in orbit determinations by obtaining the _ a posteriori _ probability distribution for the parameters using a markov chain with a gibbs sampler strategy .",
    "our problem is identical to the one described by @xcite , where now the @xmath15 contains both rv and astrometric observations and the model has a few more free parameters .",
    "several properly adjusted mcmc with @xmath66 steps have been computed obtaining compatible results .",
    "the step sizes of the gibbs sampler are initialized with the formal errors from the best fit least - squares solution , and adjusted to obtain a transition probability between 10% and 20% .",
    "the first @xmath67 steps of each chain are rejected .",
    "the final distributions match very well the areas of low faps in the ep - maps ( see figure [ fig : dist ] as an example ) giving further proof that the chains have converged to the equilibrium distributions .",
    "the mcmc contains @xmath68 free parameters ",
    "the @xmath42 from the least - squares periodogram plus eccentricity and period . when the rvs measurements from z09 are included , and additional offset parameter is included .",
    "table [ tab : pars ] presents the standard deviations obtained via the mcmc for both the 50  d and 270  d periods using astrometry alone and astrometry + all rv data . as an example",
    ", we show the two dimensional density of states in period - eccentricity space in figure [ fig : dist ] ( left ) obtained in both cases around the 270  d signal .",
    "the marginalized distributions for @xmath69 in the form of histograms are shown in figure [ fig : dist ] ( right ) .",
    "for the astrometry - alone case , the distribution of @xmath69 is almost uniform .",
    "it becomes strongly peaked towards high eccentricities when all the rv data are included .",
    "since the best fit solution at 270  d is poor ( @xmath70 ) , the corresponding @xmath15 minimum is not very deep which is reflected in a significant increase in the derived uncertainties ( see table [ tab : pars ] ) .",
    "the same happens to the signal at 50  d with the exception of the inclination that has a small uncertainty ( @xmath71 deg ) close to 0 .",
    "even though this solution has a low fap , the inclination has to be coincidentally very small to suppress any rv signal and very different from using astrometry only ( @xmath72 deg ) , rasing serious doubts of its reality .",
    "the non - detection of a significant rv variation in our data set already discards most orbital configurations allowed by the astrometry . when combined with z09 rvs measurements ,",
    "there are no remaining solutions with a fap lower than 10% around the 270  d period , so the presence of a planet candidate at that period is not supported by the observations .",
    "for the 50  d period , the constraints are also strong and become almost definitive when the z09 data is included .",
    "even highly eccentric solutions have a relatively large fap ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we find that particular combinations of eccentricity , inclination and @xmath50 can fit an almost flat rv curve indicating that the analytic methods applied to estimate faps for high eccentricities tend to give over optimistic results and that this issue should be studied in more detail .",
    "we have developed and implemented useful tools for detailed analysis of combined astrometric and rv data : circular least - squares periodogram as the proper generalization of the classic lomb - scargle periodogram to deal with astrometric data , ep - maps to visualize the most likely period  eccentricity combinations and a bayesian characterization of the parameter uncertainties based on a mcmc approach .",
    "vb  10 is also part of the carnegie astrometric planet search program @xcite .",
    "rv measurements with precision techniques in the near - infrared @xcite may provide the required accuracy to put even stronger limits to the existence of vb10b or find other planets in the system .",
    "vb  10 will certainly be observed by the space astrometry mission gaia @xcite , which would be capable of finding a planet with a period of 270  d and as small as @xmath74 m@xmath57 .",

    "<S> however , the best fit solutions still have rms of @xmath4 ms@xmath2 indicating that the excess in variability is due to uncontrolled systematic errors rather than the candidate companions detected in the astrometry . </S>",
    "<S> although the new data alone can not rule - out the presence of a candidate , when combined with published radial velocity measurements , the false alarm probabilities of the best solutions grow to unacceptable levels strongly suggesting that the observed astrometric wobble is not due to an unseen companion . </S>"
