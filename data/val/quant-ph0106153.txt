    "quantum computers have been much studied in recent years due mainly to the possibility of solving some important problems more efficiently on quantum computers than is possible on classical machines @xcite .",
    "however quantum computers and quantum robots @xcite are also interesting from other viewpoints .",
    "for example , a study of these systems may help to determine what properties a quantum system must have to conclude that it has significant characteristics of intelligence .",
    "if quantum mechanics is universally applicable , then many intelligent quantum systems exist ( e.g. the readers of this paper ) .",
    "the fact that these systems are macroscopic , which may be necessary , does not contradict the fact that they are also quantum systems .",
    "another aspect originates in the fact that basis states of multiqubit systems in quantum computers are product states @xmath0 of the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a function from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "and @xmath5 is the state of the jth qubit . here",
    "the state @xmath0 is supposed to be a binary representation of a nonnegative integer . even though this representation is assumed implicitly in the literature , it is not trivial , especially regarding conditions that a composite physical system must satisfy in order that it admits states representing numbers @xcite .    the notion that states @xmath0 represent the nonnegative integers can be extended to @xmath6 representations of more general types of numbers , such as all integers and rational numbers @xcite .",
    "the representations can also be extended by considering the states @xmath5 to represent symbols in some language .",
    "the language can be formal as is the case for axiom systems studied in mathematical logic , or informal as is the case in english . in this case",
    "the symbol basis states would include orthogonal states for each of the 26 letters in the alphabet and states for some punctuation symbols .",
    "word states would consists of products of the symbol basis states excluding the spacer symbol state .",
    "these would be used to separate the different words .",
    "these representations are of interest for several reasons . as part of an attempt to characterize intelligent quantum systems ,",
    "one wants to understand what physical properties a quantum system must have so that it can be said to be creating text that has meaning to the system generating the text .",
    "another is related to the need to develop a coherent theory of mathematics and physics together that is maximally internally self consistent .",
    "in such a theory one would expect mathematical logical concepts to be closely integrated with quantum mechanics or some generalization such as quantum field theory .",
    "since mathematical logic deals with systems of axioms as words in a language and their interpretation , such an integration would require the representation of words by quantum states .",
    "the potential importance of this has been recognized by other work .",
    "included are recent work on theories of everything @xcite , an attempt to use feynman diagrams to represent expressions in propositional logic @xcite , and other relevant work @xcite .    in order to see how",
    "mathematical logical concepts such as truth , validity , consistency , and completeness might be used in quantum mechanics , an example will be studied that is based on a simplification of a simple machine described by smullyan @xcite .",
    "the description of the simplified machine , given in the next section , is followed by a description of a quantum machine that is similar to a quantum turing machine @xcite .",
    "additional details are given in @xcite .",
    "the simplified version of smullyan s machine m @xcite , used here prints , one symbol at a time , a nonterminating string of any one of the five symbols @xmath7 .",
    "words are defined as any finite strings of symbols that exclude the @xmath8 which denotes a spacer symbol .",
    "based on this the machine prints a steadily growing string of words separated by finite spacer strings .",
    "some of the words , which are separated from other words by spacer strings , are assigned a meaning .",
    "these words , referred to as sentences , are @xmath9 and @xmath10 where @xmath11 is any word that is not a sentence .",
    "the strings @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are examples of these two types of sentences with separating @xmath16 shown .",
    "the intended meaning of @xmath9 is that @xmath11 is printable and that of @xmath10 is that @xmath11 is not printable .",
    "the restriction that @xmath11 is not a sentence is not present in smullyan s original example .",
    "it is made here to keep things simple and avoid inference chains generated by words of the form @xmath17 , etc .. removal of the restriction is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the term `` printable '' refers to the dynamical description of m. if the dynamical description of m correctly predicts the behavior of @xmath18 , then any word that is printable will be printed sooner or later . if the word is not printable , then it will never be printed .    based on the assigned meaning of these words , @xmath9 is defined to be _ true _ if @xmath11 is printable .",
    "it is false if @xmath11 is not printable .",
    "@xmath10 is _ true _ if @xmath11 is not printable and false if @xmath11 is printable .",
    "these definitions relate truth and falseness of the sentences to the dynamics @xmath19 of @xmath18 .",
    "however nothing is said so far about whether these statements are true or false .",
    "this is accounted for by defining the dynamics of m to be _",
    "valid _ if any printable sentence is true .",
    "it follows that false sentences are not printable .",
    "it is also the case that the dynamics is valid if no sentences are printable .",
    "this possibility is avoided by requiring the dynamics to be _",
    "complete_. that is , it must be such that for all @xmath11 that are not sentences , either @xmath9 or @xmath10 is printable .",
    "it is _ consistent _ if at most one of @xmath9 or @xmath10 is printable .",

    "this extends to quantum turing machines the definition based on classical machines @xcite that defines the algorithmic complexity of a theory as the length of the shortest program as input to a universal machine that generates the theorems of the theory .",

    "let @xmath222 be an axiom system that is consistent .",
    "use of one form of the gdel completeness theorem @xcite , that says that an axiom system is consistent if and only if it has a model , gives the conclusion that there exists an interpretation of the theorems of @xmath224 into a model universe that gives them meaning .",
    "thus the word states generated by @xmath218 as theorems of @xmath224 have a meaning .",
    "let @xmath223 be obtained from @xmath222 by selecting one formula @xmath240 from @xmath222 and adding its negation @xmath241 to @xmath222 .",

    "it is clear that the algorithmic complexity of @xmath219 for this case is essentially the same as for @xmath218 .",
    "this is the case because the increased length of @xmath242 , which includes information needed to carry out copying a formula @xmath240 and adding the negation symbol is small compared to the length of @xmath243 .",
    "however since @xmath223 is inconsistent , @xmath225 has no models , so there is no interpretation of the theorem states generated by @xmath219 that gives them meaning .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "this result shows that the relation between the meaning of quantum states and the algorithmic complexity of the dynamics that generates the states must be quite complex , if there is any relationship at all .",
    "one hesitates to conclude that there is no relationship at all because the above proof is based on an overall framework or context that the word states have or do not have meaning as theorems of axiomatizable theories .",
    "one must allow the possibility that a different result might be obtained if the output states of the @xmath235 were viewed in a different context .",
    "it should be noted that the correctness of @xmath19 for @xmath18 is different from the validity of @xmath19 as used here .",
    "@xmath19 is correct for @xmath18 if calculated descriptions , based on the properties of @xmath19 , of the dynamical behavior of @xmath18 are correct .",
    "this includes calculations of the probability of occurrence of any word @xmath11 by any time step @xmath53 and of other properties .",
    "@xmath19 is valid if some of the words are assigned a meaning and these sentences are true on their domain of meaning .",
    "it is possible for @xmath19 to be correct and not valid",
    ". this would be the case if @xmath19 correctly predicts the ( nonzero ) probability of occurrence of a sentence that is false .    the path interpretation and resulting truth definitions for the words @xmath147 and @xmath149 , eqs .",
    "[ pxtr ] and [ notpxtr ] , have the consequence that it is impossible for a sentence to be not printable and false .",
    "this follows from the fact that if the right hand limits of eqs .",
    "[ pxtr ] and [ notpxtr ] equal @xmath8 , then these equations must hold as the left hand limits are also @xmath8 as the matrix elements are all nonnegative .",
    "this supports the restriction of the meaning domain of a sentence @xmath244 to the paths containing @xmath244 .",
    "if @xmath244 is not printable , it either has an empty meaning domain for the intended interpretation or it has a different meaning or interpretation for which eqs .",
    "[ pxtr ] and [ notpxtr ] do not apply .",
    "this limitation of meaning domains does not appear in some other interpretations .",
    "for example , let printability be defined , as before , by eq .",
    "suppose @xmath147 is interpreted to mean that @xmath131 appears in any path , not just the paths containing @xmath147 , and @xmath149is interpreted to mean that @xmath131 appears in no paths at all .",
    "then @xmath147 is true if latexmath:[$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\langle\\psi(n )    if latexmath:[$\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\langle\\psi(n )    is true if @xmath149 is false and conversely , and there is no restriction on the meaning domain of these sentences .",
    "however it is still the case that if these words are not printable then @xmath19 does not provide information about its own dynamics in that it says nothing about what can or can not be printed .",
    "as was noted already the choice of which states have meaning and what these states mean was imposed externally .",
    "@xmath18 was completely silent about the meaning of its output .",
    "as such this work is a prelude to examining some much deeper and potentially more interesting problems . consider @xmath18 to be a complex quantum system , such as a quantum robot , @xcite , moving in and interacting with a complex environment of quantum systems .",
    "as @xmath18 moves about it generates output or signals .",
    "the state of the cumulative output at time @xmath76 can be represented by a density operator @xmath246 .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath246 allows for the increase of the length or complexity of the output with increasing @xmath76 .",
    "this increase with @xmath76 is the case for the dynamics of m described by eq .",
    "[ wdpthsum ] where the length of the word path states generated by m increases with the time step number @xmath53 .",
    "the density operator description is used to account for the possibility that states of the output systems are entangled with states of other quantum systems in m or in the environment .",
    "a basic question is `` what properties must @xmath246 have so that we as external observers conclude that @xmath246 has meaning ? '' even more important is the question `` what properties must @xmath246 have so that we would conclude that it has meaning to m , the system that generated it ? '' and `` would the two meanings be the same ? ''",
    "if we interpreted @xmath246 to be a theoretical and experimental description of m s environment , and the interpretation was valid , one might expect , and perhaps may even require that @xmath246 have the same meaning and interpretation for m as for us as external observers .    in essence this problem is faced all the time by each human being in interactions with other humans .",
    "all writing and speaking and use of other means of communication can be described in terms of some system m generating output that in essence creates systems described by a time dependent state @xmath246 .",
    "the state is time dependent because new output is being generated either continuously or sporadically by m. each of us must be able to assign meaning to the states of the output of others .",
    "this meaning is , for the most part , the same as the meaning assigned by the system generating the output .",
    "a potentially important aspect of _ existing _ systems m that generate output with meaning and of the output systems also is that they are all large quantum systems for which the relevant degrees of freedom are macroscopic or essentially classical .",
    "it is suspected that that this may be a necessary condition .",
    "the main reason is that if the output consists of quantum systems in some time dependent quantum state that is not quickly stabilized by decoherent interactions with the environment @xcite , then reading the output to determine if it has meaning or not , requires knowledge of what basis to use for the reading . as was shown in section [ dvb ] ,",
    "reading the output state in another basis will give the wrong result with a finite probability that depends on the relation between the two bases .",
    "also the state will be changed so that one can not read the state another time to get the original answer .",
    "in this paper an example of a machine @xmath18 generating output , analyzed by smullyan @xcite to illustrate various mathematical logical concepts was described quantum mechanically .",
    "symbol strings states of the form @xmath147 and @xmath148 where @xmath131 was any symbol string state without @xmath16 that did not have this form were assigned a path meaning .",
    "for these words , referred to as sentences , @xmath147 was defined to be true if all paths containing @xmath147 also contained @xmath131 ; @xmath149 was true if no path containing @xmath149 also contained @xmath131 .",
    "the dynamical evolution of @xmath18 described by iteration of a unitary step operator @xmath19 was represented by a feynman sum over word paths .",
    "based on this @xmath19 was defined to be valid if each sentence was true on any path containing it .",
    "@xmath19 was defined to be complete if each sentence appeared on some path , and @xmath19 was defined to be consistent if no path contained both @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "based on these definitions it was seen that the mathematical logical concepts of truth , validity , completeness , and consistency , have different properties than in the classical case .",
    "for instance the domain of meaning of a sentence was limited to the paths containing it .",
    "sentences had no truth value for paths not containing them .",
    "also , contrary to the classical case for which there is just one path , it is possible for @xmath19 to be valid and consistent and for both a sentence and its negation to appear on some paths .",
    "however no sentence and its negation can have any path in common .",
    "it was also seen that a slight extension of the model to include self referential sentences gives an incompleteness result similar to that of the first gdel incompleteness theorem .",
    "a main purpose of this paper was to present and emphasize the main results of @xcite without the extensive intervening mathematics .",
    "the figure was presented to illustrate more clearly the above definitions and their relationships .",
    "new material includes showing that the properties defined above depend on the basis used to define symbol states .",
    "for instance it was seen that validity of a dynamics @xmath19 was not preserved under a unitary change of the symbol basis .",
    "however there is a transformed dynamics that does preserve validity provided the initial state is changed suitably . as was seen in the discussion",
    "this result is relevant to the question regarding how one determines if output generated by a quantum system @xmath18 moving in a quantum environment has meaning , if any , to @xmath18 .",
    "if the output system states are not stabilized by interaction with the environment , one must know what basis to use to examine the output to answer this question .",
    "another new result was obtained by examining the relation between the potential meaning of word string states in general and the algorithmic complexity of the systems generating the word string states .",
    "two word string states were described that had essentially the same algorithmic complexity . for one string state",
    "the component word states had meaning . for the other they had no meaning .",
    "the contextual basis of the two states was the same in that they were both theorem enumerations based on two different axiom sets , one consistent and the other inconsistent .",
    "this shows that the relationship between the potential meaning of a word string state and the algorithmic complexity of the dynamics generating the string must be quite complex , if any relationship even exists .",
    "in conclusion it is noted that the work done in this paper is a small initial part of a larger attempt to combine mathematical logical concepts with quantum mechanics .",
