    "a two - level system , namely a qubit in today s modern physical language is a most simple quantum physical model .",
    "if we only consider a closed qubit its dynamics is simple enough and has been well known . however ,",
    "in fact , there is not any system being separated from its environment , in nature .",
    "the interaction between the qubit and its environment should be considered when we investigate the qubit s dynamics .",
    "the interaction make the open qubit model become very complex and it may not be solved analytically exactly . in order to investigate the model , in most cases , the environment is modeled with a thermal bath which is considered being constructed with a set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "a typical open qubit model is the well known spin - boson ( sb ) model @xcite .",
    "there is another open qubit model in which the qubit couples to the coordinate @xmath0 of a harmonic oscillator which we shall sometimes call the `` intermediate harmonic oscillator '' ( iho ) and which in turn is coupled to a bath jchemphys_83_4491,annphys_293_15,physrevlett_93_267005",
    ". we call the model the spin - iho - bath ( sib ) model .",
    "it has be found that the two models have many physical correspondences . in recent years",
    "the investigations of the two models have attached great interest of scientists in felids of quantum information , electron transfer , etc . chemphys_310_33,jchemphys_118_179,jphyschema_103_9417,jchemphys_102_4600 , @xcite .",
    "these are motived by two exciting challenges , quantum computation and solar energy utilization .",
    "it is believed that quantum computers may perform some useful tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts . despite the great promises of performing quantum computations , however , there are still many practical difficulties to be resolved before quantum computers might become available in future .",
    "one of the difficulties is that the qubit has too short decoherence time , which is in fact a central impediment for practical solid - state qubits to be taken as the cell of quantum computers .",
    "many significant results in the field , not only theoretical but also experimental , have been achieved .",
    "most of the theoretical research is based on the sb and sib models . on the other hand",
    ", the sb and sib models can be used to describe the electron transfer in chemical and biological molecules .",
    "it has been recent found that the coherence is very important to electrons for transferring energy in biological systems nature_446_782,science_316_1462 .",
    "so it is important to investigate the decoherence and the relaxation of the electron spin ( qubit ) .    in order to investigate the decoherence and relaxation of qubit in sb and sib models ,",
    "essentially , one must understand the dynamics of the qubit advphys_54_525,chemphys_296_135,jphyssocjpn_75_082001 .",
    "if the qubit energy splitting ( denoted by @xmath1 hereinafter ) is not equal to zero , the two models are not exactly solvable .",
    "however , they can be analyzed using adiabatic renormalization in which a systematic weak damping approximation must be used .",
    "they can also be investigated with some approximation methods based on the perturbative scheme which also asks for the system ( qubit ) weakly coupling to its environment .",
    "many other methods physreva_70_062106,chemphys_296_315,repprogphys_63_669,physreve_72_056106,physreve_56_334,physreve_58_4288 for solving the models have been proposed in recent years , most of which are based on the born - markov approximation .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the use of the approximation is inappropriate at the large tunneling amplitude and low temperatures .",
    "so it is important to find out some methods to accurately estimate the dynamics of the qubits in the two models .",
    "based on the insight into the dynamics we may understand the decoherence and relaxation better and may bring forward some schemes on how to suppress them .",
    "an excellent , accurate numerical method based on the qusiadiabatic propagator path integral ( quapi ) chemphyslett_221_482,jmathphys_36_2430 may be a suitable tool for solving the two models . to our problems we choose the iterative tensor multiplication ( itm ) algorithm for the numerical scheme . as makri chemphyslett_221_482,jmathphys_36_2430 addressed that the method is non - markovian and it can make the calculations accurate enough even at very low temperatures , large tunneling amplitude and strong couplings for which the markovian approximation is unsuitable . in paper",
    "i chemphyslett_449_296 using the itm algorithm we investigated the dynamics and then the decoherence and relaxation of the qubit in the sb and sib models as the bath modes with higher frequencies than the oscillating frequency of the iho . in this paper by using the same itm algorithm we shall investigate the decoherence and relaxation of the qubit in low- and medium - frequency baths . where we consider one kind of bath , the ohmic bath interacting with the qubit .",
    "the low - frequency bath denotes that the ohmic bath modes with lower frequencies than the oscillating frequency of the iho and the medium - frequency bath refer that the ohmic bath modes with the frequencies approaching to the iho s one .",
    "the hamiltonian of the sb model is@xmath2 .   \\label{e1}\\]]suppose the bath has an ohmic spectral density@xmath3here , @xmath4 is the dimensionless kondo parameter  jchemphys_102_4600,jchemphys_102_4611 ( the relationship of @xmath4 with the friction coefficient @xmath5 is @xmath6 physreva_70_042101 ) , @xmath7 @xmath8 are the pauli matrix , and @xmath9 is the high - frequency cut - off of the bath modes .",
