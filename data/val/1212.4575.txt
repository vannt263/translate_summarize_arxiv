    "gallen , switzerland ( latitude 47.4  n ) , all despite the supernova s southern declination of decl.@xmath1 @xcite . throughout much of the twentieth century ,",
    "sn1006 languished in relative obscurity compared with the attention lavished on the other eleventh - century supernova , sn1054 , that gave rise to the crab nebula .",
    "but once @xcite called attention to the event and @xcite constrained its location , radio emission from the sn1006 remnant was soon discovered by @xcite .",
    "it has since become a widely observed and important object : x - rays from sn1006 were discovered by @xcite ; optical emission by @xcite ; and ( following a somewhat checkered history ) tev @xmath2-rays were definitively detected and mapped by the hess collaboration @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered that the ne and sw limbs of sn1006 have a featureless , power - law x - ray spectrum , providing the first conclusive evidence that electrons can be accelerated to tev energies in supernova shocks and cementing the long - suspected connection between supernovae and cosmic rays . yet",
    "no infrared emission has previously been reported from sn1006 .",
    "the sn1006 remnant has a limb - brightened shell , 30  in diameter with strong bi - lateral symmetry in radio and x - rays .",
    "its distance is well determined at 2.2 kpc @xcite , and it is located high above the galactic plane ( @xmath3pc ) .",
    "its high - latitude location leads to relatively low foreground absorption .",
    "sn1006 itself was almost certainly a type ia event , based on its location , environment far from any recent star formation , apparent absence of any compact remnant , and implication from chinese records that it remained visible for several years @xcite .",
    "the optical emission from its remnant consists solely of balmer - dominated filaments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which indicate that it is expanding into an environment with relatively low density that is at least partially neutral , another signature of snia remnants .",
    "supernovae and their remnants are critical to dust grain formation , modification , and destruction .",
    "dust grains may condense from metal - rich sn ejecta , and the fast shock waves in snrs can lead to sputtering through collisions with shock - heated gas that erode and eventually destroy dust grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although these processes have been observed in a number of snrs , sn1006 nevertheless provides a unique perspective due to its location high above the galactic plane in a relatively pristine region of the ism .",
    "there is growing observational evidence for the formation of dust in the ejecta from core - collapse sne , including sn1987a @xcite , cas a @xcite , and the crab nebula @xcite , and in the late - time emission from a number of more distant sne , ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent models by @xcite predict that small dust grains can also form in the ejecta from type ia sne , and that @xmath4 of dust can survive for @xmath5 years .",
    "however , no dust associated with ejecta has as yet been observed in any of historical remnants of the snia : tycho ( sn1572 ) , kepler sn1604 ) , or rcw86 ( probable sn185 remnant ) , all of which have been widely observed in the infrared .",
    "mid - ir emission from both tycho and kepler was detected from the infrared astronomy satellite ( iras , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and both have been observed in detail from iso @xcite , _ spitzer _",
    "@xcite , _ herschel _ @xcite , and other missions .",
    "rcw86 was also detected from iras @xcite , and @xcite have recently presented detailed observations with _",
    "spitzer_. @xcite have also reported ir observations for four snia remnants in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "all these cases show thermal emission from dust grains and provide evidence for grain destruction in sn shocks , but none shows convincing evidence for grain _ formation _ ( see especially * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we report the first detection of ir emission from the sn1006 remnant . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we describe the results of an imaging mapping campaign with the _ spitzer _ space telescope , which reveals a filament of 24@xmath0 m emission along the nw limb of the shell , plus very faint , diffuse emission elsewhere . in section 4",
    "we describe the spectroscopic observations from the infrared spectrometer ( irs ) on _ spitzer _ , and in section 5 we present a discussion in which we fit dust models to both sets of data and assess the total dust mass and dust - to - gas mass ratio .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary of our results in section 6 .",
    "we mapped sn1006 twice with the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as part of program 30673 : on 2007 march 5 and 2007 august 22 . in order to cover the entire 30  shell and the surrounding background field , each observation required a pair of overlapping scan maps , which were taken consecutively .",
    "the march aors ( 18724608 and 18725120 ) were carried out during a  cold \" campaign and included observations at 24@xmath0 m , 70@xmath0 m , and 160@xmath0 m , while the august ones ( 18724864 and 18725376 ) were during a  warm \" phase of the cryogenic mission and gave only 24@xmath0 m and 70@xmath0 m data .",
    "both pairs of scans consisted of 14 legs of length 0.75 ; offsets of 148  were used for the march pair , while the august pair used offsets of 111  to give greater exposure of sn1006 itself at a cost of somewhat less surrounding background .",
    "we began with basic calibrated data ( bcd ) files from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive that had been processed through version 18.12 of the _ spitzer _ pipeline , and we then performed further flat - fielding by taking a median of the hundreds of frames from each aor , and dividing all the frames from that aor by the normalized flat .",
    "the estimated zodiacal light was then subtracted from each frame , and the maps were mosaicked together onto a standard world coordinate system , 50  square with 1  pixels , using the mopex software provided by the _ spitzer _",
    "science center . finally , we used daophot in iraf to remove the vast majority of point sources ( mainly stars ) from the mosaic image , in order to better assess the diffuse emission from sn1006 itself .",
    "the full 24@xmath0 m mosaic is shown in fig .  1 , with both the original and star - subtracted versions in panels @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "these clearly show the first detection of sn1006 in the mid - infrared .",
    "for reference , we also show images of the identical sn1006 field in h@xmath8 , x - rays , and radio in other panels of the figure .",
    "the most prominent ir feature is the thin filament along the nw rim of the shell .",
    "even this brightest emission is quite faint , with peak surface brightness levels above the background of 0.25 - 0.3 mjy sr@xmath9 , only about 6% of the background emission and fainter than either the tycho or kepler snrs by more than a factor of 20 .",
    "the integrated flux from this filament in the 24@xmath0 m band is @xmath10mjy , where the precision is limited by our tracing of the filament and ability to assess the background accurately , since there is diffuse background as well as faint residual stars in the  star - subtracted \" mosaic .",
    "we used a similar approach for the 70 @xmath0 m data , except that here the mosaic has a scale of @xmath11 . despite our flat - fielding all the data using median frames for each aor , artifacts along the scan directions are nevertheless evident in the final mosaic , shown in the bottom left panel of fig .  1 .",
    "there is the slightest hint of an enhancement in the region of the nw filament , but this does not trace the narrow filament and is barely larger than background fluctuations in the vicinity .",
    "we give only an upper limit for the average surface brightness in the region of the filament : @xmath12 mjy sr@xmath13 , and an integrated flux @xmath14 mjy .",
    "the 160 @xmath0 m images , compiled using only the two scans from 2007 march for which 160 @xmath0 m are available , are quite noisy and show no discernible emission from sn1006 .",
    "the nw filament corresponds closely with the optical filament that appears only in the hydrogen balmer lines @xcite , as shown in the deep continuum - subtracted image shown in the lower right panel of fig .  1 .",
    "nonradiative \" filaments characterize fast shocks expanding into a low - density , partially neutral environment , and that are generally associated with relatively young remnants from type ia supernovae such as sn1006 .",
    "balmer emission from these filaments has two components , both the result of neutral h atoms that cruise through the shock . in the hot post - shock environment",
    ", the neutrals can be excited and decay to produce narrow lines ( with a width characteristic of the pre - shock temperature ) , or they can undergo charge exchange with hot protons to produce broad lines whose width is closely related to the post - shock proton temperature . since the lifetime of neutral atoms in the hot post - shock environment is very short , the balmer filaments can occur only _ immediately _ behind the shock , and thus delineate the current position of the shock .    to investigate the post - shock characteristics of emission along the nw filament in various bands , we have compared 24@xmath0 m , h@xmath8 , and x - ray images .",
    "we have used a higher resolution h@xmath8  image , taken from the 0.9 m telescope at ctio on 2002 march 21 , for which the stars were subtracted using a matched continuum image ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , instead of the one shown in fig .  1c . likewise , in x - rays we have used the 0.5 - 2.0 kev data from a 90 ks observation taken 2001 april 26 - 27 with the _ chandra _ acis - s ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , rather than the mosaic of shorter acis - i exposures used in fig .  1e .",
    "we first checked the alignment of all three images  image we of course used the version _ before _ continuum subtraction ; the coordinates for the subtracted image are identical . ] using four near point sources common to all : one bright star and three distant galaxies , and found their positions in all three bands to agree within 0.5 . to simulate images in all three bands at a common epoch",
    ", we used the @xmath15 proper motion rate for the nw balmer filaments , measured relative to the center of curvature at @xmath16 by @xcite , to extrapolate the h@xmath8  and x - ray images from their original epochs ( 2002.2 and 2001.3 , respectively ) to the 2007.5 mean epoch for the _ spitzer _ mips scans .",
    "( recent measurements from _ chandra _ find x - ray proper motions along most of the nw rim of sn1006 that agree with those measured for the optical filaments , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in fig .",
    "[ opt_ir_xray ] we show a three - color combination that compares the 24@xmath0 m ( red ) , h@xmath8(green ) , and x - ray ( blue ) images of the nw filament , and in fig .",
    "[ profiles ] we plot radial profiles taken perpendicular to the filament , integrated over the four azimuthal regions outlined in fig .",
    "[ opt_ir_xray ] .",
    "it is clear that the 24@xmath0 m emission has a broader spatial profile that peaks 3 - 5 arcsec behind the balmer filament , as best illustrated in region d of fig .",
    "[ profiles ] where the profiles are the cleanest .",
    "the filament is also noticeably broader in the ir than in h@xmath8 , with fwhm @xmath17 .",
    "this is not simply a resolution effect .",
    "the resolution of the 24@xmath0 m mosaic image  measured from profiles of several isolated stars  is 6   ( fwhm ) , consistent with the diffraction limit , but small compared with the width of the filament .",
    "we attribute this ir emission to dust from the ism that enters the shock , where it is heated through collisions with hot post - shock gas , produces ir emission , and is then destroyed .",
    "somewhat further behind the shock , soft , primarily thermal , x - ray emission appears , rising to its peak about 10  behind the shock , just as the 24@xmath0 m emission is decaying away .",
    "this indicates the longer time scale for producing the highly ionized species that radiate efficiently and dominate the x - ray emission @xcite . we can estimate the time scales through simple kinematics : the primary shock is moving outward to the nw at @xmath18 , and if we assume the nominal compression ratio of 4 between the post - shock and pre - shock densities , the post - shock material is dropping behind the shock at speed @xmath19 , or @xmath20 ( relative to the shock )",
    "therefore , the ir peak occurs some 60 yr after that material was shocked , and the x - ray peak occurs @xmath21 yr after the shock .",
    "we shall discuss the emission profiles further in sec .",
    "5.1 of this paper .    in 2012 march , all - sky survey data from the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ,",
    "* ) were released .",
    "examination of data from the sn1006 region in all the wise bands ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22 @xmath0 m ) shows emission from sn1006 only in the 22@xmath0 m band .",
    "not surprisingly , the wise 22@xmath0 m image is very similar to the _ spitzer _",
    "24@xmath0 m one , and clearly shows the nw filament .",
    "however , the wise data have somewhat lower angular resolution and signal - to - noise than that from _",
    "spitzer_. the non - detection of emission in the shorter - wavelength _ wise _ bands is consistent with the lack of short - wavelength emission in other type ia remnants @xcite .",
    "close examination of the images from the improved reprocessing of the iras survey ( iris ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) also shows traces of the nw filament in the co - added 25@xmath0 m image ; however , it is unlikely that this faint feature would ever have been independently discovered in these low - resolution ( 1.5 ) maps .",
    "in addition to the narrow filaments along the nw rim of the shell , there is patchy , diffuse emission within much of the southern part of the sn1006 shell , clearly visible in the 24@xmath0 m mosaic and less so in the 70@xmath0 m one .",
    "the morphology of this emission is similar at both 24@xmath0 m and 70@xmath0 m , and is also similar to patchy emission extending well outside the sn1006 shell , especially to the south and east . in the southern portion of sn1006 , there is also faint , diffuse emission in both h@xmath8  and x - rays ( fig .",
    "1c and e ) , but unlike along the nw rim , the morphology in the south is only vaguely similar to that seen in the ir . in the absence of further data , we can not determine whether the faint ir emission is associated with sn1006 itself or stems from cool foreground dust .    in x - rays ,",
    "sn1006 shows knots of emission interior to the shock that are thought to arise largely from sn ejecta , but there are no obvious small - scale ir features that correlate with these x - ray - emitting ejecta knots .",
    "hence we find no evidence for the formation of dust in sn1006 ejecta .",
    "this is somewhat surprising in view of theoretical predictions for dust formation in snia ejecta @xcite , but is consistent with observations of other type ia snrs @xcite .",
    "we conducted irs observations , all in staring mode for about 90 min each , at three locations along the nw filament .",
    "we show the slit positions of these irs pointings , labeled 1 - 3 , in fig .",
    "[ irs_overlays ] , overlaid on the mips 24 @xmath22 image of the filament .",
    "as noted earlier , the filament is quite faint in the ir ( its average surface brightness is only about 6% above the background at 24 @xmath22 ) , and it was undetected in the sl ( 5.5 - 14 @xmath22 ) spectrum .",
    "however , faint emission is detected in the ll order 2 ( 14 - 19.3 @xmath22 ) spectrum , where the dust continuum begins around 17 @xmath22 and continues to rise throughout the ll order 1 ( 19 - 40 @xmath22 ) spectrum .",
    "we see no evidence for line emission anywhere in the spectrum , consistent with the non - radiative nature of the blast wave shock at this location @xcite .",
    "the data used in our analysis ( aor ids 28138240 and 24142080 ) were processed with _ spitzer",
    "_ calibration pipeline version s18.7.0 . using the idl cubism software @xcite",
    ", we assembled the 72 bcd files from positions 1 and 2 along the nw filament into two data cubes , one for ll1 and one for ll2 .",
    "the irs spectrum from position 3 is similar , but we have omitted it from our subsequent analysis because it falls on a region where different abundances were required to fit the x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "hot pixels affect the bcds ( especially beyond 35 @xmath22 ) , so we median smoothed the bcds before creating the data cubes using the filter_image routine from the idl astronomy user s library .",
    "the smoothing replaces the value of each pixel with the median of the surrounding 3 pixels in a moving box and significantly mitigates the hot pixels in the resulting data cubes .",
    "while the smoothing reduces the spatial resolution of the data somewhat , the emission from the filament is highly uniform and we expect minimal loss of information .",
    "after combining the bcds within cubism , we extracted ll1 and ll2 spectra from the nw filament using positions 1 and 2 marked in fig  [ irsoverlays ] .",
    "these two positions are only @xmath23 apart and their irs spectra appear virtually identical ; therefore , we have combined them into a single object spectrum . to estimate the sky background , we extracted separate ll1 and ll2 spectra from locations just outside sn1006 ( marked in fig  [ irsoverlays ] ) .",
    "we averaged the two sky spectra in each order and combined them to produce a final sky spectrum .",
    "we subtracted this spectrum from that of the sn1006 filament to obtain the final spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ irsfit ] .",
    "we describe the fits to this spectrum in the following section .",
    "infrared emission in typical snr shocks is produced entirely by collisional heating of dust grains ( dwek & arendt 1992 ) , where energetic electrons and ions collide with the grains , heating them to temperatures of 50 - 100 k. collisions with protons and heavier ions are also responsible for grain sputtering , reducing the size of large grains and destroying many small grains entirely .",
    "we have developed models for such dust that self - consistently calculate both the heating and the destruction of grains in the post - shock gas as a function of the density of the hot plasma , @xmath24 , the electron and ion temperatures , and the shock sputtering age @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "for an arbitrary input grain size distribution , we can use these models to calculate the ir spectrum and the post - shock profile that results as grains are heated , and eventually destroyed .",
    "the electron temperature , @xmath26 , and the ionization timescale can be determined from a non - equilibrium ionization analysis of the x - ray spectra , as @xcite did for the nw limb using _ chandra _ data .",
    "we have revisited that analysis , taking into account hydrocarbon contamination of the acis detectors that was unrecognized at the time of the original analysis , and using more reliable atomic data .",
    "we first redetermined the absorption column density @xmath27 from the reprocessed synchrotron - dominated eastern limb data , fit using xspec @xcite with a pure synchrotron _",
    "srcut _ model to obtain @xmath27 = ( 8.2 @xmath28 0.8 ) @xmath29 10@xmath30 @xmath31 .",
    "we fixed @xmath27 at this value in fitting long et al s region nw-1 , which includes our irs regions 1 and 2 .",
    "we obtained reasonable fits using a solar - abundance plane - shock model ( _ vnpshock _ ) , and obtained values of @xmath32 kev , ionization timescale @xmath33 , and emission measure @xmath34 @xmath35 .",
    "this is a somewhat higher electron temperature than the @xmath36 kev found by @xcite , but is still far below the post - shock proton temperature of @xmath37 kev , inferred from the balmer line profiles by @xcite .",
    "* also measured a similar value for @xmath26 at a different position along the nw rim . ) .",
    "we then applied a coulomb - heating model for collisions between electrons and protons behind the shock , and found that over the relatively small region we consider here , the mean proton and electron temperatures are 16 kev and 1.0 kev , respectively .",
    "we use these temperatures for the remainder of this work .",
    "our models also require as input a distribution of grain sizes in the ism ahead of the shock .",
    "a commonly used distribution for the galaxy is that of @xcite .",
    "their models are appropriate for the diffuse ism in the disk of the galaxy , where the total - to - selective extinction ratio @xmath38 , and for dense clouds where @xmath39 . at the location of sn1006 some 500 pc above the galactic plane , however , the abundance of dust  both in total amount and in the distribution of grain sizes  is likely very different from that near the galactic plane .",
    "there is significant evidence for much lower values for @xmath40 at high galactic latitudes @xcite . @xcite",
    "have calculated grain size distributions using the same formalism as @xcite for over 70 lines of sight to stars with `` anomalous extinction sightlines . ''",
    "particularly relevant for our work , they extend these models down to low - density environments with @xmath41 .",
    "we use the model from table 3 of @xcite , with @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( this is a parameterization in their models that corresponds to the number of small carbonaceous grains ) .",
    "the grain size distributions corresponding to lower values of @xmath40 are steeper than their `` typical '' milky way counterparts , i.e. , they have an excess of small grains relative to large ones , resulting in a larger fraction of the total mass in grains being destroyed via sputtering for a given shock , as well as a different gas density required to produce the observed spectrum . in our models , the spectrum from warm dust is most sensitive to the gas density in post - shock plasma , so we have used proton density @xmath24 as the principal free parameter . using the grain size distribution described above , we have fit the irs spectrum over the range 21 - 37 @xmath0 m and obtain a best fit for a density of @xmath43 , shown in blue in fig .",
    "[ irsfit ] .",
    "the 21 - 37 @xmath0 m range comprises all the data for which the signal - to - noise ratio is high enough to be useful .",
    "the uncertainty quoted is a formal 90%-confidence limit based on statistical uncertainties only , determined from the rms deviations from an arbitrary smooth polynomial fit to the spectrum in this range .",
    "we have made no provision for systematic errors in the irs spectra , which are difficult to quantify .",
    "there is good reason to believe that the actual density is near the lower limit of the fitted range , near @xmath44 . from an analysis of the thermal x - ray emission along the nw rim based on _ chandra _ observations",
    ", @xcite found a post - shock electron density @xmath45 .",
    "analysis of x - ray data from _ xmm - newton _ using a different modeling approach led @xcite to a _",
    "pre_-shock density value of @xmath46 , equivalent to a post - shock density of @xmath47 for a standard compression ration of 4 . and",
    "finally , an estimate based on the thickness of the h@xmath8 filaments in an image from the _ hubble _ space telescope by @xcite , and subsequently corrected by @xcite , gave @xmath48 , and thus a post - shock density @xmath49 . in fig .",
    "[ irsfit ] we also show , in red , a model with @xmath50 , which gives an acceptable fit to the irs data . finally , we note that the predicted 70 @xmath0 m surface brightness for any of our models is @xmath51 , well below the upper limit reported in section 2 .",
    "we have also calculated the spatial profile for the decay of ir emission as grains are destroyed through sputtering in the hot , post - shock environment , assuming that the shock has been advancing through an ambient medium of constant density . in comparing the model with the observed radial profiles , we find that the observed decay is far more rapid than the sputtering model predicts , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ profile_models ] .",
    "even if we assume a grain - size distribution heavily weighted toward small grains to give @xmath41 , for a density of @xmath52 the sputtering rate would need to be artificially enhanced by a factor 6 to 8 to match the observed profiles .",
    "however , it is almost certain that the shock along the nw rim of sn1006 has _ not _ been passing through a uniform - density environment . the ambient density to the nw",
    "is clearly higher than that around the remainder of the shell , as evidenced by the following facts : ( 1 ) the flattening of the shell to the nw ; ( 2 ) the fact that the proper motion along most of the nw limb is only about 60% as high as that to the ne @xcite ; ( 3 ) the density contrast around the shell required from x - ray observations @xcite ; and ( 4 ) the mere fact that there is significant ir emission along the nw limb , yet little or none elsewhere .",
    "since the shell radius to the nw is only about 15% smaller than elsewhere , the shock must have encountered the denser region there relatively recently . as a result ,",
    "the post - shock density profile , for both gas and dust , should drop as one moves inward from the shock .",
    "therefore the decrease in ir emission behind the shock is likely due in large part to the fact that farther inward the grain density has always been lower , representing an earlier epoch in the evolution of sn1006 .",
    "we suggest that this may account for the rapid drop in ir emission @xmath53 behind the shock ( fig .",
    "[ profile_models ] ) . for a density @xmath54 ( equivalent to @xmath55 )",
    ", the shock age from x - ray spectroscopy is about @xmath56 years , suggesting that the shock was encountering considerably lower densities earlier .",
    "detailed modeling of such a scenario is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that the observed post - shock drop in ir emission is so much sharper than predicted by the models , even close to the shock , probably indicates that current models significantly underestimate the actual dust sputtering rate .",
    "effects that could be responsible include an even greater proportion of small grains , grains of high porosity , or a grain composition that leads to higher sputtering rates .",
    "enhanced sputtering rates are not without precedent ; @xcite found that hydrogenated dust grains ( perhaps the most common type of grains in the ism , at least for carbonaceous materials ) are sputtered at rates several times higher than their pure amorphous counterparts .",
    "the spectral data are insufficient to determine whether the carbonaceous grains in sn1006 are hydrogenated or amorphous .",
    "almost independent of the models , we can determine the total amount of dust radiating in the nw filament , provided that the integrated ir luminosity is relatively well - known .",
    "we have used the measured ir flux , @xmath10mjy ( section 2 ) , and assumed that the overall shape of the dust spectrum observed with irs ( shown in fig .",
    "[ irsfit ] ) is applicable along the entire length of the filament to obtain @xmath57 , where we have scaled to a distance of 2.2 kpc : @xmath58 .",
    "our models assume optical constants from @xcite for graphite and amorphous silicate grains in the ism , with relative proportions and grain - size distributions from @xcite . as in @xcite",
    ", we then calculate the dust mass in the nw filament as @xmath59 , where the uncertainty limits for both @xmath60 and @xmath61 include the overall 15% uncertainty in the _ spitzer _ mips extended source flux calibration .",
    "of course , this method of determining the total dust mass is insensitive to any cold dust  undetectable with _ spitzer_but it is difficult to imagine how a significant fraction of interstellar dust ( consisting almost entirely of small grains , @xmath62 m ) could remain cold within the hot plasma behind such a fast shock .",
    "our value for @xmath61 includes only the dust now radiating along the nw filament ; the overall faintness of the rest of the snr at 24@xmath0 m , combined with the lack of detection at 70 @xmath0 m , precludes determination of a dust mass for the entire remnant .      in previous works @xcite",
    "we have used the density determination from ir data , combined with the x - ray emission measure , to obtain a measure of the amount of shocked gas present within a given emitting volume .",
    "we have obtained the dust mass from the overall normalization to the dust spectrum , so dividing the two gives the dust - to - gas mass ratio . in the case of sn1006 , however , the irs spectra do not strongly constrain the density .",
    "thus , we employ an alternative approach .    @xcite examined the ultraviolet spectrum of a section of the nw filament obtained with the _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope _ ( _ hut _ ) and measured 0.02 heii ( 1640  ) photons @xmath31 s@xmath9 .",
    "more recent work by chayer ( private communication ) has revised the reddening towards sn1006 to be @xmath63 , lowering the heii flux to 0.017 photons @xmath31 s@xmath9 . according to the laming et al .",
    "models , 0.0067 heii photons come out for each h atom crossing the shock .",
    "for the 200  section of the filament observed ( corresponding to a distance of @xmath64 cm at @xmath65 kpc ) , the he ii flux measured at earth would be @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the pre - shock h number density , @xmath68 is the shock speed , and @xmath69 is the line - of - sight depth through the emitting material , all of which are presumed ( for this purpose ) to be unknown .",
    "taking @xmath70 photons @xmath31 s@xmath9 , we can rearrange the above equation to give @xmath71 cm@xmath9 s@xmath9 .",
    "the length of the nw-1 region is @xmath73 , or @xmath74 cm at @xmath65 kpc ,",
    "so @xmath75 h atoms per second enter the shock .",
    "if we assume a standard post - shock flow of @xmath76 , based on the proper motion measurements of @xcite , then the width of the ir filament corresponds to a timescale of 150 years . during this time , the shock will have swept up 6.3 @xmath77 h atoms , or 7.6 @xmath78 of gas .",
    "the uncertainties in the _ hut _ measurement of the he ii flux and in the reddening correction are about 15% each , while the uncertainty in proper motion is only 3% and the uncertainty in the relative atomic rates is probably about 30% , so we estimate an uncertainty in the gas mass of @xmath79 . using the dust mass determined above ,",
    "this leads to a dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath80 .",
    "the expected dust - to - gas mass ratio for the galaxy within the model of @xcite is 5.3 @xmath81 , a factor of @xmath82 higher than what we measure .    the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the ambient medium surrounding sn 1006 appears to be lower than that expected from dust models for the galaxy , including those at high galactic latitudes .",
    "this has been the case for virtually all snrs studied , both in the galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the magellanic clouds @xcite .",
    "the ultimate reason for this remains a mystery , but in the case of sn1006 specifically , its location within the galaxy may provide a clue . at some 500 pc above the galactic plane , sn1006 is located at the interface between the disk and halo ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review of gaseous galaxy halos and their interfaces to galactic disks ) .",
    "accumulating evidence points to a lower dust content there than in the galactic disk @xcite , coupled with a higher proportion of smaller grains @xcite .",
    "an expected increase in the sputtering rate for smaller grains might better match the rapid drop - off in the 24@xmath0 m profile behind the shock ( fig .",
    "[ profile_models ] ) than the current dust model , and it would also raise our inferred value of the pre - shock dust - to - gas mass ratio , bringing it even more in line with the @xcite value .",
    "we further note that any dust that is too cold to be observed with _",
    "spitzer _ would increase the dust - to - gas mass ratio above our inferred value .",
    "our current determination of the dust - to - gas mass ratio is quite uncertain , as we do not know the grain size distribution in the pre - shock gas .",
    "it is possible that models with a larger dust - to - gas ratio and a larger overabundance of small grains can be as viable as our current model with @xmath83 .",
    "this model degeneracy might be broken by future joint ir , x - ray , and uv studies focused on accurate determination of abundances of refractory elements in the postshock gas .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations of the entire region surrounding the remnant of sn1006 show a clear detection of the nw filament at 24 @xmath0 m , the same filament that is prominent in h@xmath8 emission .",
    "irs spectroscopy of this filament shows that the ir is produced entirely by continuum emission from warm dust grains , with a spectrum peaking somewhere beyond 35 @xmath0 m .",
    "the filament is not detected at 70 @xmath0 m , likely due to the significantly higher background ir emission .",
    "the ir emission from the nw filament reaches its peak just inside of the h@xmath8 emission , while the x - ray emission peaks still a little further behind .",
    "this is as expected , since h@xmath8 emission should trace the exact location of the forward shock , while dust grains require a short amount of time to be heated to temperatures observable by _ spitzer _ and then are sputtered away , while the post - shock gas requires even longer to become ionized enough to emit strongly at _ chandra _ energies",
    ".    fits to the _ spitzer _ irs spectrum taken at two positions along the nw filament , using models of collisionally - heated dust grains , do not tightly constrain the post - shock density @xmath24 .",
    "the nominal best fit gives @xmath84 ( 90%-confidence ) ; we have adopted a model with @xmath85 , the value suggested from observations in other bands , for our subsequent analysis .",
    "the decay of the ir spatial profile behind the shock is far more rapid than expected from standard dust models .",
    "this is may be due in part to a high proportion of small dust grains in the ambient ism at the location of sn1006 , high above the galactic plane , and probably also results in part as a relic of the shock s having encountered a higher density region to the nw relatively recently .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that sputtering rates significantly higher than those predicted by standard models will be required to fully explain the rapid decline in ir emission behind the shock .",
    "calculations of the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the ambient ism indicate a value of approximately @xmath86 , compared to the expected value of 5 @xmath81 for the galaxy at the latitude of sn1006 .",
    "this difference of a factor of several is a phenomenon seen in virtually all ir / x - ray analyses of snrs .",
    "the remnant of sn1006 provides a rare opportunity to study the ism high above the galactic plane , and further ir , x - ray , and uv studies are necessary to understand this remnant .",
    "this research is based on observations made with the _ spitzer _",
    "space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
    "we are grateful to the support staff at ipac for their guidance with some of the subtleties of _ spitzer _ data analysis .",
