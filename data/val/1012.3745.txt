    "since eliashberg s formative paper @xcite classifying overtwisted contact structures on 3manifolds , the study of and interest in such structures has been minimal .",
    "however , in recent years they have been taking a more central role due to their many interesting applications  such as , the construction of achiral lefschetz fibrations @xcite and near symplectic structures @xcite on certain 4manifolds and the understanding of the existence of engel structures on 4manifolds @xcite  as well as the interesting knot theory they support .",
    "this paper is aimed at studying the legendrian and transverse knot theory of overtwisted contact structures .",
    "we begin with a brief history of the subject .",
    "a legendrian or transverse knot in an overtwisted contact structure @xmath0 on a 3manifold @xmath1 is called if the contact structure restricted to its complement is also overtwisted , otherwise the knot is called .",
    "though apparently known to a few experts , the first explicit example of a non - loose knot was given by dymara in @xcite , where a single non - loose legendrian unknot was constructed in a certain overtwisted structure on @xmath2 .",
    "more recently , eliashberg and fraser @xcite gave a coarse classification of legendrian unknots in overtwisted contact structures on @xmath2 , see theorem  [ mains3contacto ] below .",
    "( we say knots are if they are classified up to co - orientation preserving contactomorphism , smoothly isotopic to the identity .",
    "we reserve the word to refer to the classification up to legendrian isotopy , and similarly for transverse knots . )",
    "an immediate corollary of this work is that there are no non - loose transverse unknots in any overtwisted contact structure .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that there are knot types and overtwisted contact structures for which there were arbitrarily many distinct non - loose legendrian knots realizing that knot type with fixed thurston - bennequin invariant and rotation number . while it is easy to construct non - loose transverse knots in any overtwisted contact structure ( one just observes , _ cf .",
    "_ @xcite , that the complement of the binding of a supporting open book decomposition is tight ) , two non - loose transverse knots with the same self - linking numbers were first produced by lisca , ozsvth , stipsicz and szab , in @xcite , using heegaard - floer invariants of legendrian and transverse knots .",
    "there have been very few results concerning the classification of legendrian or transverse knots in overtwisted contact structure ( as opposed to the coarse classification ) , but there has been some work giving necessary conditions for the existence of a legendrian isotopy , see for example @xcite .",
    "leaving the history of the subject for now we begin by recalling a version of the bennequin bound for non - loose knots .",
    "this result first appeared in @xcite where it was attributed to wiatkowski .",
    "[ looselegbound ] let @xmath3 be an overtwisted contact 3manifold and @xmath4 a non - loose legendrian knot in @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath5 for any seifert surface @xmath6 for @xmath4 .",
    "we sketch a simple proof of this result below .",
    "we now observe a relation between non - loose transverse knots and their legendrian approximations as well as non - loose legendrian knots and their transverse push - offs .",
    "[ nltnll ] if @xmath7 is a non - loose transverse knot then any legendrian approximation of @xmath7 is non - loose .",
    "if @xmath4 is a non - loose legendrian knot then the transverse push - off of @xmath4 may or may not be non - loose .",
    "the previous two results imply that a version of the bennequin bound for transverse knots in a tight contact structure also holds for non - loose transverse knots .",
    "this is in stark contrast to what happens for legendrian knots as proposition  [ looselegbound ] indicates and eliashberg and fraser s coarse classification of unknots , given in theorem  [ mains3contacto ] below , confirms .",
    "[ prop : nlsl ] let @xmath3 be a contact 3manifold and @xmath8 a transverse knot in @xmath0 with seifert surface @xmath6 . if @xmath9 then @xmath8 is loose ( and , of course , @xmath0 is overtwisted ) .",
    "in particular any non - loose knot @xmath8 in an overtwisted contact structure satisfies the bennequin inequality @xmath10      the following two theorems make precise the well - known `` folk '' theorems that loose legendrian or transverse knots are coarsely classified by their classical invariants .",
    "[ thm : legloose ] let @xmath3 be an overtwisted contact manifold . for each null - homologous knot type @xmath11 and each pair of integers",
    "@xmath12 satisfying @xmath13 is odd , there is a unique , up to contactomorphism , loose legendrian knot @xmath4 in the knot type @xmath11 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "recall that for any legendrian knots @xmath4 we must have @xmath16 odd , so the above theorem says any possible pair of integers is realized by a unique loose legendrian knot in any overtwisted contact structure . for transverse knots we have the following result .",
    "[ thm : transverseloose ] let @xmath3 be an overtwisted contact manifold . for each null - homologous knot type @xmath11 and each odd integer @xmath17 there is a unique , up to contactomorphism , loose transverse knot @xmath7 in the knot type @xmath11 with @xmath18 .",
    "again recall that the self - linking number of any transverse knot must be odd and thus the theorem says that any possible integer is realized by a unique loose transverse knot in an overtwisted contact structure .",
    "these two theorems follow directly from eliashberg s classification of overtwisted contact structures and a careful analysis of homotopy classes of plane fields on manifolds with boundary , which we give in section  [ sec : loose ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm : legloose ] also appears in @xcite though the details of the homotopy theory were not discussed , and while these details are fairly straight forward they do not seem obvious to the author . in particular , when studying the homotopy classes of plane fields there is both a 2 and 3-dimensional obstruction to being able to homotope one plane field to another .",
    "the fact that the 3-dimensional obstruct is determined by the thurston - bennequin invariant and rotation number seems , at first , a little surprising until one carefully compares the pontryagin ",
    "thom construction with a relative version of the pontryagin ",
    "thom construction .",
    "geiges and independently , klukas , in private communication , informed the author of another way to deal the the homotopy issues and prove the above theorems .",
    "similar theorems , with extra hypotheses , concerning legendrian isotopy were proven in @xcite .    in @xcite chernov defined relative versions of the rotation number for all ( not necessarily null - homologous ) legendrian knots as long as the ambient manifold is irreducible and atoroidal or the euler class of the contact structure is a torsion class ( or the contact structure is tight ) . in",
    "@xcite he defined relative versions of the self linking invariant ( not to be confused with the self - lining number of a transverse knot ) for all ( not necessarily null - homologous ) framed knots in atoroidal and other manifolds .",
    "this gives the definition of the relative thurston - bennequin number for legendrian knots in contact manifolds of such topological type .",
    "there should be theorems analogous to those above for non - null - homologous knots in this situation , but the precise statements would necessarily be more complicated",
    ". it would be interesting to see the precise extension of the above theorems to all non - null - homologous knots in all overtwisted contact manifolds .",
    "see @xcite for partial results along these lines",
    ".      in @xcite , colin , giroux and honda proved that if one fixes a knot type in an atoriodal 3manifold and a tight contact structure on the manifold then there are only finitely many legendrian knots with given thurston - bennequin invariant and rotation number .",
    "while this does not imply the same finiteness result for transverse knots , it seems likely that such a finiteness result is true for such knots too .",
    "surprisingly this finiteness result is far from true in an overtwisted contact structure .",
    "we begin with some notation and terminology .",
    "we call the open book for @xmath2 with binding the unknot the and say an open book decomposition is if it is not diffeomorphic to the trivial open book decomposition .",
    "if @xmath3 is a contact 3manifold and @xmath11 is a topological knot type we denote by @xmath19 the set of all transverse knots in the knot type @xmath11 up to contactomorphism ( co - orientation preserving and smoothly isotopic to the identity ) .",
    "( we note that in some contexts , one might want this to denote the transverse knots up to transverse isotopy , but in this paper we will only consider the coarse classification of knots . )",
    "if @xmath20 is an integer then @xmath21 is the set of transverse knots in the knot type @xmath11 with self - linking number @xmath20 .    given a null - homologous knot @xmath8 we will denote the maximal euler characteristic for a seifert surface for @xmath8 by @xmath22 .",
    "[ thm : infinite1 ] let @xmath23 be a non - trivial open book decomposition with connected binding of a closed 3manifold @xmath1 and let @xmath24 be the contact structure it supports . denote by @xmath0 the contact structure obtained from @xmath24 by a full lutz twist along @xmath25",
    ". then @xmath26 contains infinitely many distinct non - loose transverse knots up to contactomorphism ( and hence isotopy too ) .",
    "this theorem gives the first known example of a knot type and contact structure which supports an infinite number of transverse knots with the same self - linking number .",

    "then @xmath27 contains infinitely many distinct non - loose transverse knots up to contactomorphism ( and hence isotopy too ) .",
    "finally we have the following less specific but more general theorem along these lines .    [ generalinfinite ]",
    "let @xmath8 be a null - homologous knot type in a closed irreducible 3-manifold @xmath1 with seifert genus @xmath28 .",
    "there is an overtwisted contact structure for which @xmath29 is infinite and a distinct overtwisted contact structure for which @xmath30 is infinite .",
    "we note that as mentioned above , and proven in corollary  [ nonlunknot ] below , any transverse unknot in an overtwisted contact manifold is loose .",
    "hence the previous theorem implies that the unknot is the unique null - homologous knot in any ( irreducible ) manifold that does not have non - loose transverse representatives in some overtwisted contact manifold ( in fact all other null - homologous knots have non - loose transverse representatives in at least two overtwisted contact manifolds ) .",
    "the reason for this is simply that the unknot is the unique knot whose complement has compressible boundary .",
    "since , as noted above , legendrian approximations of non - loose transverse knots are also non - loose , we see that all null - homologous knots have non - loose legendrian representatives in some overtwisted contact structure .",

    "thus we see that @xmath366 induces a contact structure @xmath345 on @xmath1 and in that contact structure there is a knot @xmath472 such that @xmath473 is contactomorphic to @xmath474 .",
    "notice that all of the @xmath345 are overtwisted and @xmath345 is obtained from @xmath475 by a full lutz twist on @xmath472 .",
    "thus by eliashberg s classification of overtwisted contact structures we know all the @xmath345 are isotopic to a fixed overtwisted contact structure which we denote @xmath268 . as above each @xmath472",
    "gives a transverse knot , still denoted @xmath472 , in @xmath268 .",
    "each @xmath472 is clearly non - loose .",
    "moreover the surface @xmath6 above can be extended by an annulus in @xmath7 so that in @xmath1 it gives a seifert surface for @xmath472 .",
    "it is clear from construction that @xmath6 is convex with dividing curves parallel to the boundary .",
    "one can choose the @xmath144 so that @xmath6 will always have an even number of dividing curves or an odd number of dividing curves .",
    "if we choose the former then it is clear that all the @xmath472 have self - linking number @xmath476 .",
    "if we choose the latter then all the @xmath472 have @xmath477 .",
    "also note that going between the former and the latter amounts to doing a half - luts twist on the knots @xmath472 .",
    "thus we see that the contact structure where the @xmath472 have self - linking number @xmath478 and the contact structure where they have self - linking number @xmath22 differ by a half - lutz twist and hence are not contactomorphic .",
    "thus we will be done with the theorem once we see that all the @xmath472 are non contactomorphic . if we perturb the boundary of @xmath366 so that it is convex with two dividing curve then the resulting contact structures are the same as the ones constructed in proposition  4.2 of @xcite . in proposition  4.6 of that paper it is also shown that all these contact structures are not contactomorphic .",
    "now if there was a contactomorphism of @xmath479 taking @xmath472 to @xmath480 then @xmath474 would be contactomorphic to @xmath481 denote the contactomorphism by @xmath133 .",
    "let @xmath25 be a torus in @xmath474 with linear characteristic foliation of slope 0 ( that is the leaves are null - homologous in @xmath366 ) .",
    "let @xmath482 with @xmath483 the non - compact component .",
    "we can assume @xmath25 was chosen so that @xmath483 is minimally twisting ( that is there are no convex tori with negative slope in @xmath483 ) .",
    "the torus @xmath484 breaks @xmath481 into two similar such pieces @xmath485 and @xmath486 and @xmath133 gives a contactomorphism from @xmath409 to @xmath485 . by adding the appropriate basic slice to both @xmath409 and @xmath485 we can extend @xmath133 to a contactomorphism of the contact structures constructed in proposition  4.2 of @xcite",
    "this would contradict proposition  4.6 of that paper unless @xmath487 .",
    "we now turn to the classification of transverse knots with maximal self - linking in the hyperbolic knot type of the binding of an open book supporting the given contact structure .",
    "we are given an open book decomposition @xmath23 with connected binding . since @xmath25 is a hyperbolic knot",
    "the monodromy @xmath133 of the open book is pseudo - anosov .",
    "let @xmath0 be the contact structure obtained from @xmath24 by performing a full lutz twist on @xmath25 .",
    "clearly @xmath0 is overtwisted and in the same homotopy class of plane field as @xmath24 , so if @xmath24 is overtwisted then @xmath0 and @xmath24 are isotopic contact structures .",
    "we are trying to determine the set @xmath26 .",
    "since any knot type has a loose knot with any odd self - linking number there is clearly a loose knot @xmath36 in @xmath26 .",
    "moreover , theorem  [ thm : transverseloose ] says that this is the unique loose knot with given knot type and self - linking number so @xmath36 is the only loose knot in @xmath26 . since loose and non - loose knots",
    "are not contactomorphic we are left to classify the non - loose knots in @xmath26 .    if @xmath8 is a non - loose knot in @xmath26 then theorem  [ thm : maxclass ] implies that @xmath0 is obtained from @xmath24 by adding giroux torsion along tori which are incompressible in the complement of @xmath25 .",
    "since the monodromy @xmath133 is pseudo - anosov the only such tori are isotopic to the boundary of a neighborhood of @xmath25 . adding giroux torsion along this torus is equivalent to performing some number of full lutz twists along @xmath25 in @xmath24 .",
    "thus @xmath8 is clearly one of the @xmath346 constructed in the proof of theorem  [ thm : infinite1 ] .",
    "notice that @xmath488 , the knot obtained from @xmath25 by doing no lutz twists , is a transverse knot in @xmath0 if and only if @xmath24 is overtwisted to begin with .",
    "thus we see that any non - loose knot in @xmath26 is contactomorphic to one of the knots @xmath489 where @xmath405 is the indexing set in the statement of the theorem .",
    "finally lemma  [ lem : torsioncompute ] guarantees that @xmath346 and @xmath490 are not contactomorphic if @xmath491 since they have different contact structures on their complement .",
    "renaming @xmath346 to @xmath472 , we have now classified the transverse knots in @xmath26 and established the first bullet point in the theorem .",
    "the second bullet point follows from @xcite since all the knots except @xmath39 have either an overtwisted disk or giroux torsion in their complement .    to establish the last bullet point in the theorem",
    "we notice that each @xmath472 for @xmath492 has a neighborhood contactomorphic to @xmath493 for some @xmath233 , with the contact structure @xmath494 .",
    "thus we can choose a convex torus @xmath7 outside of the solid torus @xmath495 with two dividing curves inducing the framing @xmath496 for some @xmath41 ( where we use the page of the open books to define the 0 framing ) .",
    "thus we can find a neighborhood @xmath68 of @xmath472 that breaks into two pieces @xmath497 $ ] and @xmath498 , with the following properties .",
    "the contact structure on @xmath405 is not invariant in the @xmath499 $ ] direction and the boundary of @xmath405 is convex with each boundary component having two dividing curves inducing the framing @xmath496 .",
    "the contact structure on the solid torus @xmath106 is minimally twisting and the boundary of @xmath106 is convex with two dividing curves inducing the framing @xmath496 . from @xcite ,",
    "we know @xmath106 is the standard neighborhood of a legendrian curve @xmath4 whose positive ( if @xmath4 is oriented in the same way that @xmath472 is oriented ) transverse push - off is @xmath472 . if we stabilize @xmath4 positively then its positive transverse push - off is a transversely isotopic to the stabilization of @xmath472 , see @xcite .",
    "let @xmath500 be a neighborhood of the stabilized legendrian inside of @xmath106 .",
    "from @xcite we know that we can write @xmath106 as the union of @xmath501 $ ] and @xmath500 where @xmath502 is a basic slice .",
    "the sign of this basic slice depends on the stabilization of @xmath4 that we perform .",
    "one may easily check that all the basic slices in any decomposition of @xmath405 into basic slices all have the same sign and that sign is opposite the one associated to @xmath502 if we positively stabilize @xmath4 .",
    "thus the contact structure on @xmath503 is a non - minimally twisting contact structure made from basic slices with different signs .",
    "such a contact structure must be overtwisted , @xcite .",
    "since the transverse push - off of the stabilized @xmath4 is contained in @xmath500 we see that the complement of this transverse knots is overtwisted since it contains @xmath503 .",
    "thus the complement of a stabilization of @xmath472 is overtwisted and we see that a stabilization of @xmath472 , for @xmath492 , is loose .",
    "theorem  [ thm : transverseloose ] then guarantees all the stabilizations of the @xmath504 are contactomorphic to the stabilization of @xmath36 .",
    "we note that it is not clear if the stabilizations of @xmath39 , if it exists , are loose or not .",
    "finally , if @xmath34 is some overtwisted contact structure and @xmath7 is a transverse knot in @xmath26 that is non - loose then theorem  [ thm : maxclass ] implies that @xmath34 is obtained from @xmath24 by adding some number of full lutz twists along @xmath25 ( notice that the only incompressible tori in the complement of @xmath25 are boundary parallel tori ) .",
    "thus if @xmath34 is not so obtained then @xmath505 .",
    "using well know facts concerning the relation between legendrian and transverse knots , mostly reviewed in subsection  [ revlegtrans ] above , we can upgrade the coarse classification of transverse knots from theorem  [ thm : tclassify ] to legendrian knots .    by theorem  [ thm : tclassify ]",
    "we know that @xmath506 , where @xmath32 if @xmath24 is tight and @xmath507 if not . for any @xmath508",
    "the transverse knot @xmath37 was the core of a full lutz twist .",
    "thus it has a neighborhood @xmath509 that is contactomorphic to @xmath510 , with the contact structure @xmath511 , where @xmath512 is the disk of radius @xmath136 .",
    "there is an infinite sequence of radii @xmath513 an integer , such that @xmath514 has a linear characteristic foliation of slope @xmath515 .",
    "let @xmath516 be a leaf in this foliation .",
    "lemma  [ legapprox ] says that @xmath37 is the transverse push - off of @xmath516 .",
    "since the contact framing of @xmath516 is the same as the framing coming form the torus @xmath517 it sits on , we see that @xmath518 and hence @xmath519 .",
    "if @xmath24 is overtwisted then we can similarly construct legendrian approximations @xmath520 of @xmath39 for all @xmath38 less than some @xmath41 , where @xmath41 is either an integer or @xmath521 .",
    "it is clear from proposition  [ nltnll ] that all the @xmath522 constructed here are non - loose .",
    "moreover , they are all distinct as they either have different transverse push - offs or they have different thurston - bennequin invariants .",
    "let @xmath4 be a non - loose legendrian knot in @xmath51 .",
    "we begin by assuming that @xmath523 and hence @xmath524 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a standard neighborhood of @xmath4 with convex boundary .",
    "we assume the characteristic foliation on @xmath111 has two closed leaves and all leaves are transverse to a ruling of @xmath111 by longitudes .",
    "let @xmath6 be a fiber in the fibration of @xmath336 . from our set up",
    "@xmath241 is a transverse curve @xmath525 .",
    "moreover it is easy to see that @xmath7 is the transverse push - off of @xmath4 and @xmath526 .",
    "by lemma  3.3 in @xcite we can isotope @xmath6 so that it has a morse - smale characteristic foliation and no negative singular points .",
    "thus @xmath6 is convex and dividing curves are disjoint from @xmath241 . from the proof of lemma  3.4 in @xcite",
    "we see that @xmath6 may be isotoped so that the dividing curves @xmath527 on @xmath6 are invariant under the monodromy of the open book . as",
    "the monodromy is pseudo - anosov the only dividing curves @xmath6 can have are ones parallel to @xmath241 .",
    "assume that @xmath6 has been isotoped ( keeping @xmath241 transverse and contained in @xmath111 ) to minimize the number of dividing curves .",
    "we show that the contact structure on the complement of @xmath68 is determined by the dividing curves on @xmath6 .",
    "taking a neighborhood @xmath106 of @xmath528 and rounding corners we see that @xmath529 is obtained by gluing together two copies of @xmath6 , denoted @xmath530 and @xmath531 , and an annulus @xmath405 .",
    "we can assume that @xmath529 is convex and that its dividing curves consist of a copy of @xmath527 on each @xmath532 and one curve in the center of @xmath405 , see @xcite . since @xmath6 is a page of an open book for @xmath1 we see that @xmath533 is a handlebody .",
    "moreover , applying lemma  3.5 in @xcite we see that the minimality of the number of components of @xmath527 implies that the dividing curves on compressing disks are uniquely determined by @xmath527 .",
    "thus the contact structure on @xmath533 is determined by the number of curves in @xmath527 . moreover",
    ", since the difference between @xmath533 and @xmath336 is a neighborhood of @xmath6 , a similar argument says that @xmath336 is determined by the number of curves in @xmath527 .",
    "one may easily check that @xmath534 has a convex surface with the same configuration of dividing curves in the complement of a standard neighborhood , where @xmath535 is the number of components in @xmath527 .",
    "thus @xmath4 is contactomorphic to @xmath534 .",
    "if @xmath536 , and hence @xmath537 , then we can proceed as above except now the ruling longitudinal curves on @xmath111 , oriented in the same direction as @xmath4 , are negatively transverse curves .",
    "thus @xmath241 is a negatively transverse curve @xmath7 on @xmath111 .",
    "we can identify @xmath68 as a neighborhood of a transverse curve @xmath344 that is a positive transverse push - off of @xmath4 , and hence has @xmath538 .",
    "the curves @xmath7 and @xmath344 cobound an annulus @xmath405 whose characteristic foliation as a single closed leaf @xmath197 .",
    "the legendrian @xmath197 is clearly topologically isotopic to @xmath4 and has thurston - bennequin number 0 .",
    "moreover , @xmath344 is its positive transverse push - off and @xmath7 its negative push - off . from the first fact",
    "we see @xmath539 and from the second fact we see @xmath540 .",
    "notice that if we orient @xmath7 in the same direction as @xmath25 and @xmath6 so that it has oriented boundary @xmath7 , then the characteristic foliation on @xmath6 points in along @xmath7 ( because @xmath7 will be a negatively transverse to the contact structure ) . by the proof of lemma  3.3 in @xcite we can isotope @xmath6 so that it has a morse - smale characteristic foliation and no positive singular points .",
    "we can now argue as above to conclude that @xmath4 is contactomorphic to @xmath541 for some @xmath20 .",
    "the hypothesis of the theorem says that @xmath4 and @xmath542 are in the same knot type , up to diffeomorphism .",
    "thus if @xmath4 is in @xmath543 then @xmath542 is in @xmath544 , so the result follows from theorem  [ thm : lclassify ] .",
    "moreover , all the knots claimed to be in @xmath59 can be obtained knots in @xmath543 by reversing the orientation on the knot .",
    "we assume that @xmath55 is not isotopic to @xmath25 .",
    "this condition implies there is no diffeomorphism taking @xmath25 to @xmath55 that is isotopic to the identity .",
    "thus a contactomorphism that is smoothly isotopic to the identity and takes a legendrian knot @xmath4 in @xmath545 to itself must preserve the orientation on @xmath4 and hence on any surface with boundary on @xmath4 .",
    "so we can conclude if the contactomorphism is also co - orientation preserving then it preserves the sense of a stabilization . by this",
    "we mean that if @xmath546 and @xmath133 is such a contactomorphism of @xmath0 then @xmath547 .    now suppose that @xmath548 and @xmath549 .",
    "set @xmath550 .",
    "notice that @xmath551 .",
    "thus by theorem  [ thm : lclassify ] we know there is a contactomorphism @xmath133 sending @xmath552 to one of the legendrian knots described in the theorem ( one may also check that @xmath133 preserves the co - orientation of the contact structure ) , and from the observation above @xmath553 is isotopic to one of the knots described in the theorem .",
    "if it is isotopic to any knot other than @xmath49 , that is the loose knot , then any number of negative stabilization will stay non - loose .",
    "it is clear , however , that there is some @xmath41 such that @xmath554 can not be non - loose since it does not satisfy @xmath555 .",
    "thus @xmath556 can not be non - loose resulting in a contradiction unless @xmath557 is already loose , which of course implies @xmath552 is loose ."
