    "the advances in nanofabrication of the last years opened the goal to build 2d quantum dots ( qds ) and quantum dot molecules ( qdms ) ",
    "artificial mesoscopic semiconductor structures of selectable shape and size   as _ containers _ for a controllable fixed number of electrons @xcite .",
    "recently , depending on the strength and shape of the effective confining potential , the formation of spin density waves ( sdws ) @xcite and wigner crystals @xcite in qds and qdms has been predicted by different groups with different theoretical approaches .",
    "hirose and wingreen @xcite argue that sdws are reproducible artefacts of spin density functional calculations . for a 2d parabolic confining potential",
    "the accordance of the spin - configuration with hund s rule has been predicted by koskinen , manninen , and reimann @xcite and questioned by yannouleas and landman@xcite .",
    "all these effects are governed by the intriguing interplay between shell effects , the pure coulomb repulsion , and the fermionic repulsion due to the pauli exclusion principle and depend strongly on the values of the interaction parameters in the commonly for single qds assumed hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the dielectric constant , @xmath2 is the effective mass , and @xmath3 defines the strength of the confining potential .    apart from the interesting physical questions that arise for quantum dots the reliable prediction of their properties is an ultimate test of modern methods in quantum chemistry . due to the compared to atoms very shallow confining potential long range electron interactions and correlations play an important role in qds and qdms .",
    "therefore it is misleading to name them artificial atoms and molecules .",
    "well established and very elaborate methods of quantum chemistry might fail in describing them properly .",
    "hartree - fock and spin density functional methods use single slater determinants or sums of them to approximate the many - body wave function . in spin - density functional methods the approximation of the functional for the exchange correlation energy @xcite adds another source of uncertainty and systematic errors to this approach . the path integral monte carlo method ( pimc ) used in this paper samples the full many - body wave function instead .",
    "in contrast to density functional methods with pimc it is possible to study the temperature dependent properties of qds .",
    "the reason why pimc is not yet a standard method of quantum chemistry is its numerical limitation due to the fermion sign problem .",
    "the rapidly increasing power of modern computers resizes this limitation . in sec .",
    "[ method ] we briefly summarize our implementation of pimc and comment on how to limit the numerical deficiencies due to the fermion sign problem",
    ".    we apply pimc to calculate the electron density and two - particle correlation functions for quantum dots with up to 12 electrons . to compare to various experimental as well as to other theoretical studies we use different dielectric constants @xmath1 and strengths of the confining parabolic potentials .",
    "the calculated addition energies are in very good agreement with the experimental findings of tarucha et  al .",
    "@xcite .    for @xmath4",
    "we investigate the temperature dependence of the wigner crystallization  ( wc ) .",
    "for a system of @xmath5 electrons with position eigenket @xmath6 ( @xmath7 for spin - up and spin - down electrons ) in an external potential the feynman path integral can be written as @xcite @xmath8 \\prod_{\\delta=1}^{m } \\det(a(\\delta,\\delta+1))\\\\ & \\times&\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta}{m } \\sum_{\\alpha=1}^{m } v(\\vec{x}_1(\\alpha),\\ldots,\\vec{x}_n(\\alpha))\\right ) +   { \\cal o}\\left(\\frac{\\beta^3}{m^2}\\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 and the boundary condition @xmath10 .",

    "( [ pfad ] ) becomes exact . for quantum dots",
    "the space dimension is d=2 and the ( 2nm)-dimensional integral given in ( [ pfad ] ) can be evaluated by standard metropolis monte carlo techniques . due to the determinant",
    "the integrand is not always positive and the expectation value of an observable @xmath13 depending only on position operators has to be calculated using @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the value of the observable @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the value of the integrand in ( [ pfad ] ) in the gth monte carlo step .",
    "( [ sign ] ) reveals a severe problem connected with the path integral for fermions which is commonly denoted as the _ fermion sign problem _ ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it can be shown that the ratio between integrands with positive sign ( @xmath18 ) and negative sign ( @xmath19 ) is approximately given by  @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the ground state energies of the fermi system and the corresponding bose system .",
    "it is now obvious that the statistical error in ( [ sign ] ) grows rapidly for small temperatures @xmath23 .",
    "moreover the energy difference @xmath24 will grow with increasing system size causing an increase of the statistical error .    within pimc",
    "the calculation of the kinetic energy expectation value is another critical task .",
    "this is merely due to the fact that the monte carlo calculation is usually done in position space and that the discretization of the paths allows a number of different approaches to calculate the expectation value of a momentum dependent operator .",
    "a number of various different energy estimators has been discussed in the past @xcite .    to avoid these difficulties we developed a procedure which allows the calculation of all energy expectation values from the knowledge of the pair correlation functions @xmath25 and the radial density functions per electron @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the probability of finding electron @xmath28 in distance @xmath29 from the center .    due to the particle symmetry",
    "we have @xmath30 and @xmath31 utilizing the hypervirial theorem of hirschfelder @xcite the energy can be written as a sum of ten parts  @xcite @xmath32 while in density functional approaches the calculation of the kinetic energy and the exchange correlation energy is a major topic and subject to permanent discussion , within the path integral approach these energies are included in a natural way .",
    "+ however , the systematic error arising from the limited number of timeslices @xmath11 and the statistical error of the monte carlo calculation have to be controlled carefully .",
    "we checked our algorithm extensively using eight non - interacting fermions in a parabolic trap as a test system .",
    "we found that at low temperatures where the ratio of signs is around 0.99 , convergence can only be achieved obeying the following rules : 1 ) the determinants have to be calculated very accurately using a more costly algorithm with pivoting .",
    "2 ) the completely uncorrelated generation of the monte carlo steps is essential , i.e. the coordinate to be moved should be chosen randomly . moving the particle",
    "coordinates using always the same sequence produces inaccurate results .",
    "3 ) a good random number generator with a _ completely _ uncorrelated sequence in all significant bits of a 64 bit real number should be applied .",
    "we therefore developed a 53 bit random number of marsaglia - zaman type@xcite instead of using one of the standard 24 or 32 bit random number generators coming with standard system libraries .",
    "4 ) further , to improve the convergence a number of different monte carlo steps can be applied , i.e. moving single time slices , moving complete particle paths and parts of a path .",
    "+ our fortran - code is completely parallelized using mpi and lapack .",
    "to compare our pimc calculations to experimental data we calculated the addition energies @xmath33 of a qd with up to 11 electrons using the material constants @xmath34 and @xmath1 = 12.9 for gaas as given by hirose and wingreen @xcite .",
    "it is assumed that these parameters mimic the experimental setup of tarucha et  al .",
    "@xcite reasonably well .",
    "the strength of the harmonic potential is fixed at @xmath35 = 3.0 mev .",
    "the resulting effective atomic units are @xmath36 = 10.955 mev for the hartree energy and @xmath37 = 10.1886 nm for the bohr radius .",
    "the boltzmann constant is @xmath38 .",
    "we performed pimc simulations for quantum dots with different spin configurations at a fixed temperature of 10 k. due to the fermion sign problem the number of monte carlo steps necessary to push the statistical error of the total energy , which has been calculated properly from 25 uncorrelated subsequences of mc steps , into the range of 0.1 percent is extremely high .",
    "the number of monte carlo steps ranged between 2.5 billion steps per particle coordinate for @xmath39 and about 10 billion steps for @xmath40 .",
    "[ addfig ] displays the addition energies for quantum dots with up to 11 electrons .",
    "the circles indicate the results from our path integral calculations at 10 k , the squares are results of spin density functional calculations of hirose and wingreen  @xcite , and the triangles are the experimental results of tarucha et  al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "both theoretical calculations reproduce the general @xmath5-dependence of the addition energies in great detail .",
    "tarucha et  al .",
    "give an estimate of the electron temperature in their experiments of @xmath41  k. for computational reasons our pimc calculations are performed at 10 k and it can not be expected that the absolute energy values agree as well as the 0  k dft calculations with the experimental results .",
    "however , it should be noted that pimc correctly predicts the drop in the addition energy from @xmath42 to @xmath43 while the dft calculations fail at this point .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "[ addfig ] displays the total spins of the spin configurations with lowest energy as found in dft and pimc at 10 k. in dft calculations ( 0 k ) the spin configuration of the ground state is determined by hund s rule for up to 22 electrons .",
    "in contrast , in our pimc calculation at 10 k the total spin is not always in accordance with hund s rule .",
    "for @xmath44 we checked the temperature dependence of the spin configuration . at 5",
    "k the energy of the spin 0 configuration is 0.01 @xmath45 higher than the spin 1 energy indicating a temperature dependence of the favored spin configuration .    as an important fact",
    "we note that the @xmath5-dependence of the addition energies is not affected by the actual spin configuration .",
    "the situation is quite similar to that in transition metal clusters with extreme small energy differences between states with significantly different magnetic moments @xcite .    as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ rhogamma](a ) the radial spin densities are significantly different for both spin configurations . the total potential energy for the spin 1 configuration is about 0.07 mev lower than that of the spin  0 configuration . at 10 k",
    "this is overcompensated by an 0.27 mev higher kinetic energy ( see tab .",
    "[ etable ] ) .",
    "although the kinetic and potential energies for different total spins significantly differ the total energies are almost equal .",
    "similar situations are found for larger @xmath5 .    for convenience and",
    "easy comparision we determined the value of the dimensionless density parameter @xmath46 , which is sometimes used to characterize quantum dots ( see e.g. @xcite ) to be @xmath46=4.19 for @xmath44 .",
    ".kinetic and potential energies as well as @xmath47=@xmath48 in mev for different electron configurations at 10 k ( the numbers in brackets are the single particle energies ) . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in conclusion , we have found that despite of the notorious fermion sign problem pimc is capable to answer interesting questions for strongly correlated electron systems like qds and qdms",
    ". for qds pimc reproduces correctly the experimental addition energies .",
    "our temperature dependent calculations give new insights into the process of wc .",
    "for the 2-dimensional qds a ratio @xmath49 below 0.1 seems to indicate wc both for @xmath1 and temperature dependent calculations .",
    "however , reagarding this aspect a more firm classification parameter e.g. similary to the lindemann criterion is desirable .",
    "a comparision to other qmc methods seems to be in order here .",
    "even our most complicated simulations took less than two hours on a cray t3e with 62 processors .",
    "taking the advantages of modern computer power and optimized software , the _ brute force _ pimc applied here is able to produce very precise results .",
    "different algorithms have been published to improve the performance of path integral methods .",
    "a recent one is the _ multi - level blocking _ method published by mak et  al .",
    "simulations using this algorithm are expected to converge better than our direct treatment since the fermion sign problem is avoided partially .",
    "the published results of the treatment of quantum dots by egger et  al .",
    "@xcite do not confirm this expectation .",
    "obviously the advantages of the new method are more than compensated by other numerical problems , maybe due to the energy estimator used @xcite . nevertheless , a combination of the multi - level - blocking method and our technique might result in a very powerful tool .",
