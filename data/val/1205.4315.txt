    "admission control is a queue management tool that can increase the efficiency of resource utilization in many service systems . depending on the particular application",
    ", it can be used to preserve system capacity for future customers who bring higher profit , to limit the number of admitted customers in order to provide a better quality of service to those already in , etc .",
    "admission control is often employed indirectly via dynamic pricing , or by price discrimination ( direct or indirect ) among different customer types .",
    "however in several situations frequent price changes may not be feasible , and in order to contain congestion denying service to certain arriving customers may be necessary .    on the other hand , in several queueing systems it is possible to alleviate the congestion effects by adjusting the service capacity .",
    "for example in banks or call centers the number of servers may change during the day to follow variations of the arrival rate .",
    "the service rate may also be varied dynamically when the queue length becomes too long . increasing ( and in some cases decreasing )",
    "the service rate comes at a cost , but it has the advantage over admission control policies that fewer or no customers are turned away .",
    "it is thus of interest to explore to what extent a flexibility in service capacity can interact with admission control and when it can alleviate its effects .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the interaction of service rate flexibility and admission control in an m / m/1 queueing system .",
    "the flexibility is modeled as the option to switch dynamically between a low and a high service rate .",
    "we analyze the problem of joint admission and service rate control by formulating a markovian decision process model to maximize the infinite horizon expected discounted profit .",
    "we also explore the effect of service rate flexibility on the optimal profit and the admission thresholds .",
    "specifically , the benefit of the service rate switch option is compared against a baseline case where only the low service rate is used and admission control is employed .",
    "thus , in principle , the benefit is due both to the existence of a higher service rate as well as the flexibility to use it . on the other hand ,",
    "the higher service rate is not free but comes at a higher cost , thus the benefit of using it reflects the tradeoff between serving at a faster rate and paying higher operational costs .",
    "when we use the term benefit of flexibility we mean exactly how this tradeoff manifests itself in the presence of admission control .",
    "the paper develops a model of dynamic optimization of queueing systems , a large area with very extensive literature .",
    "both admission and service control models have been studied thoroughly .",
    "@xcite and @xcite survey several dynamic optimization models developed for queueing control .    for single class customers problems , as the one analyzed in this paper",
    ", admission control makes sense when there is an exogenous holding cost rate function . a simple model in this direction was first presented in @xcite , where arriving customers are admitted or not based on the observed queue length with the objective to maximize customer s overall ( social ) benefit from receiving a reward after service completion minus a linear increasing holding cost per unit time of delay .",
    "it is shown that a socially optimal policy admits fewer customers than those who would decide to enter based on an individual optimality criterion .",
    "@xcite considers a @xmath0 queue under infinite horizon discounted cost , assuming a convex and nondecreasing holding cost rate function .",
    "it is shown that the optimal policy has a threshold structure if and only if the optimal benefit is concave in the number of customers in the system which in turn depends on convexity of the holding cost rate function .",
    "as in @xcite , we also consider a convex , nondecreasing holding cost rate which implies a threshold property of the optimal admission policy .    on the other hand in multi - class systems with finite capacity admission control",
    "may be useful even in the absence of holding costs , because in this case admitting a customer implies the possibility of a loss of profit from a future higher class customer .",
    "@xcite considers a system with @xmath1 parallel and identical servers , no waiting room and @xmath2 customer classes , which contribute to the system , different fixed rewards .",
    "this model results in a threshold type optimal policy with a preferred class . @xcite",
    "analyze the optimal admission rule for a system with one server and no waiting room which receives offers from customers according to a joint service time and reward probability distribution .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also investigate properties of optimal admission policies for certain loss systems .",

    "the admission control problem has been also analyzed in queueing systems under heavy traffic .",
    "an often used approach in this framework the dynamic optimization is usually approximated by a diffusion control problem , following the approach of @xcite .",
    "recent works in this area include @xcite and @xcite , both analyzing admission control under customer abandonments .",
    "@xcite analyze a @xmath5 queue in the balanced heavy traffic regime , where the optimal control depends on the sample path of the diffusion and the resulting asymptotically admission control policy of threshold type depends on second moment data of the interarrival and service times .",
    "@xcite consider the same problem in amulti - class environment under discounted expected cost minimization .",
    "dynamic service control in queueing systems is an equally large field .",
    "several problems can be viewed as service control models , including controlled server vacations , server allocation policies in polling systems , etc . in an early work",
    "@xcite examines dynamic service control under infinite horizon expected average expected cost in a maintenance system with finite available service rates , a linear holding cost rate and a reward collected in service completions .",
    "it is shown that the optimal service rate is increasing in the number of customers waiting in line .",
    "the monotonicity of the optimal service rate is also shown in @xcite in the framework of an @xmath6 queue , with service rates varying in a closed set and the holding cost rate increasing and convex . @xcite",
    "consider the service control problem in an @xmath6 queue where service rates are dynamically selected from a close subset of @xmath7 $ ] , under no switching cost , state - dependent holding cost and rate dependent service cost .",
    "they develop an asymptotic method for computing the optimal policy under average cost minimization by solving a sequence of approximating problems , each involving a truncation of the holding cost function .",
    "they prove that the optimal policies of the approximating problems converge monotonically to the optimal policy of the original problem and derive an implementable policy and a performance bound at each iteration . in our model",
    "we also derive a monotonicity property of the service control component of the problem , under a convexity assumption on the holding cost function . in the works mentioned above",
    "there are no switching costs for changing the service rate .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for models that include service rate switching costs , resulting in hysteretic policies .    in the area of joint admission and service control , two works related to ours",
    "are @xcite and @xcite , both motivated by and extending the work of @xcite .",
    "@xcite consider the joint admission and service control problem in an m / m/1 queue with adjustable arrival and service rates , under long - run average welfare maximization .",
    "they also formulate and solve an associated dynamic pricing problem .",
    "they show that the optimal arrival and service rates are monotone in the system length .",
    "however the optimal prices , which are set to induce the optimal arrival and service rates , are not necessarily monotone . finally , they find that dynamic policies can result in significantly higher profits compared to static policies .",
    "similarly to @xcite , @xcite develop an efficient iterative method for computing the optimal policy under an average cost criterion , providing a computable upper bound on the optimality gap at each iteration step .",
    "it is also shown that service rates are monotone increasing in the system state .",
    "finally , two works which consider the joint admission and service control problem in the heavy traffic regime are included in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite examine a queueing network where a central planner dynamically selects the service rate and buffer size that minimize the long - run average expected cost .",
    "the optimal policy is derived from the solution of a brownian control problem and it consists of a feedback - type drift control and a threshold type admission policy .",
    "@xcite consider a markovian system with customer abandonments and address the infinite horizon discounted problem .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , it is proved that the optimal joint dynamic policy derived from the solution of the brownian control problem is asymptotically optimal for the original problem .    in our paper",
    "we consider a simpler admission - service control model with two available service rates and explore the benefit of the service - rate flexibility .",
    "we first show that the optimal policy has a threshold structure for both controls .",
    "we introduce the value of the service rate control as the expected profit increase in the optimal admission control subproblem when the dynamic service rate change option becomes available , and show that the value is increasing with the initial level of congestion .",
    "furthermore , the effect on the optimal policy is to increase the admission threshold .",
    "we also derive a simple sufficient condition between the admission reward and the service cost so that the service flexibility is worthless .",
    "finally , we extend the results in the long - run average expected reward case and show that an optimal average reward policy exists and it can be computed as a limit function of a sequence of optimal discount policies under a sufficient condition on the holding cost rate function .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - model ]",

    "we analyze the problem under the average reward criterion . in section [ rdepart ]",
    "we consider a variation of the original model , in which the service reward is collected at departure epochs and show that the main results still hold . in section [ sec - numerical ] we present a set of computational experiments exploring the sensitivity in the system parameters .",
    "section [ sec - conclusions ] concludes .",
    "we consider a single server markovian queue under the fcfs discipline , where customers arrive according to a poisson process with rate @xmath8 . the service rate may be dynamically set to either a low or a high value , @xmath9 , without any switching cost .",
    "the service provider receives a fixed reward @xmath10 per customer admitted , and incurs holding and service costs as follows .",
    "the holding cost is equal to @xmath11 per unit time , where @xmath12 is the number of customers in the system .",
    "the function @xmath11 is assumed to be increasing and convex .",
    "the service cost is equal to @xmath13 or @xmath14 per unit time , for using service rates @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , where @xmath17 .",
    "we also assume that the low cost rate @xmath13 is incurred even when the system is empty , because of the presence of fixed costs .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the service overhead paid under high service speed . without loss of generality we normalize @xmath19 .    since the system is markovian , it suffices to assume that the system manager makes a decision at both arrival and departure epochs .",
    "service rate decisions can be made at both arrival and departure epochs , whereas admission decisions are made only at arrival epochs .",
    "assuming continuous time discounting at rate @xmath20 , the service provider s objective is to maximize the infinite horizon expected discounted net profit .",
    "thus , the problem can be framed as a continuous time markov decision process , as follows .",
    "let @xmath21 be the time of the @xmath22 arrival , @xmath23 a random variable denoting the number of customers in the system at time @xmath24 and @xmath25 the indicator of the event that @xmath24 is an arrival epoch .",
    "we define the state vector as the pair @xmath26 , thus the state space is @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath35 corresponding to arrival epochs , the action is defined by the pair @xmath36 , thus the action set is @xmath37 .",
    "on the other hand , in states @xmath38 corresponding to departure epochs , the action is defined only by @xmath39 , thus the action set is @xmath40 .",

    "we can construct a discrete - time version of the markovian decision problem as follows .",
    "depending on the state and the action employed , the transition rate out of any state can take values @xmath8",
    ", @xmath49 , or @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 denote the maximum transition rate out of any state . using standard uniformization arguments ( see section 11.5 of @xcite )",
    ", it follows that the model described in is equivalent to a model where transition rates are all equal to @xmath52 and the transition probabilities are appropriately modified . since in the original continuous time model the transition rates out of a state are generally different in different states , the discrete time formulation allows for transitions from a state back to itself so that the expected sojourn times are equal in the two models .",
    "these are referred to as fictictions transitions .    via this transformation",
    ", the problem can be written in a form equivalent to a discrete time discounted markov decision process , as follows @xmath53 where @xmath54 and for simplicity we omit the subscript @xmath55 which is constant throughout .",
    "note that in the discrete time formulation , the equivalent discount factor per transition is equal to @xmath56 and for @xmath57 it has the standard property @xmath58 .",
    "for ease of the exposition we normalize the time scale so that @xmath59 .",
    "the normalization is without loss of generality as long as the discount rate is fixed . in section [ sec - vosf ] where we consider the criterion of average reward per unit - time as a limit of the discounted reward problem when",
    "@xmath60 and thus @xmath61 , we do not make this normalization assumption .",
    "the finite horizon version of this last model is the following , where @xmath62 denotes the optimal discounted profit for the remaining @xmath1 transitions , starting at state @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 note that in the transition index on the right hand side is still @xmath65 , because after an admission decision in state @xmath66 there is an instantaneous state switch to state @xmath67 or @xmath68 , so that the corresponding service - rate decision can also be made at that instant .",
    "the advantage of writing the optimality equations in this form is that only admission decisions are made in states @xmath66 and only service decisions in states @xmath68 .",
    "since the state space is infinite and the one - step reward function is not necessarily bounded , the convergence of - to the optimal value function must be established .    to this end , we make the following assumption ensuring that the holding cost does not increase too rapidly with the queue length .",
