    "the issue of the pairwise packing between helices in proteins was addressed soon after helical structures had been suggested .",
    "a number of models were developed , mostly devoted to surface complementarities upon packing .",
    "the `` knobs into holes '' model , first introduced by crick @xcite and elaborated by richmond and richards @xcite , aimed to find the best steric fit between regular helices .",
    "chothia , levitt and richardson @xcite recognized the importance of `` ridges '' and `` grooves '' formed by residues with different sequential distances ( `` ridges into grooves '' model ) .",
    "efimov @xcite tried to relate the packing angle between the two helices with the preferred rotational states of the side - chains along them .",
    "a comprehensive analysis was eventually carried out by walther et .",
    "@xcite , by modeling helix packing as the superposition of the two regular lattices that result from unrolling the helix cylinders onto a plane and contain points representing each residue .",
    "the six `` preferred '' angles predicted by this last model are consistent with earlier results and with the histograms of the experimentally observed packing angles ( see fig",
    ". 7 of ref .",
    "the agreement between theoretical modeling and experimental data was remarkable , although not perfect ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the success of steric models in providing an explanation for the most prevalent packing angles was however put under discussion after the observation made by bowie @xcite that statistical corrections must be applied to the values collected from experimentally determined structures before true interaxial angle preferences can be revealed .",
    "indeed , the helix - helix packing is defined to occur only when :    * [ c1 ] the segment of closest approach ( sca ) , of length @xmath0 , between the two finite helix axes is shorter than a prefixed threshold @xmath1 ; * [ c2 ] this segment intersects both helix axes at a perpendicular angle .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , two helices were considered to be in contact if they were satisfying both conditions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "note that walther _",
    "@xcite selected interacting helical pairs from their database of native protein conformations , by considering distances between all possible inter - helical heavy atom pairs .",
    "we used a different selection procedure involving distances between inter - helical @xmath4 atom pairs ( see methods for details ) .",
    "none of these particular choices really affects our geometrical analysis , and condition c1 , as defined above , is just the simplest way of defining an equivalent distance constraint .",
    "condition c2 is needed to ensure face - to - face packing of the two helices , justifying thus the use of theoretical modeling based on the steric interdigitation of the helices .    if the sca is coincident with the global segment of closest approach ( gsca ) , of length @xmath5 , between the two straight lines which are obtained by indefinitely prolonging the helix axes , condition c2 is then automatically satisfied . in such a situation , which corresponds to effectively dealing with helices of infinite length ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , the reference probability distribution of interaxial angles @xmath6 is simply the spherical - polar distribution between any two random vectors , namely @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "walther and co - workers @xcite realized that the finiteness of helix axes is crucial in modifying the angular dependence of @xmath6 , because requiring that the sca intersects both axes at a perpendicular angle introduces new restrictions depending on the packing angle @xmath8 .",
    "this can be understood by looking at fig .",
    "2a , where it is shown that , fixing one helix position , and assuming the gsca to be orthogonal to the page , the second finite helix axis may then be placed only within a plane parallel to the paper plane and such that its starting point lies inside the dark shaded parallelogram @xmath9 .",
    "the probability of placing the starting point of the second helix in a is proportional to its area and therefore to @xmath10 .",
    "consequently the probability @xmath11 for selecting a particular packing angle is proportional to the product of the spherical - polar contribution and of the @xmath12 effect due to the finite length condition :    @xmath13    with this new random reference distribution the actual angular propensities need to be reconsidered . as is clear from fig . 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the normalized frequencies reveal a prominent representation of packing angles near @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( not expected by theoretical models ) whereas the predicted optimal steric packing angles manifest themselves , at most as shoulders in the distribution of propensities .",
    "the predictivity of geometrical models is cast under serious doubts after this analysis .",
    "our first observation is that the random distribution @xmath16 is correct only and only if the condition of mutual perpendicularity between the sca and the two axes is strictly fulfilled . but is this the real situation when statistical histograms are derived ?    as a matter of fact , condition @xmath3 was relaxed by walther _",
    ", by admitting a small tolerance : a total deviation @xmath17 ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the complementary angles to the angles @xmath20 and @xmath21 formed between the sca and helix 1 and helix 2 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "1b ) ) was accepted up to a threshold @xmath22 ( @xmath23 in @xcite and @xmath24 in @xcite ) .    at first",
    ", one might wonder why such a threshold needs to be used since it does not effectively increase the number of data contributing to the histograms .",
    "however , we believe that this choice is indeed necessary because of the ambiguity in the definition of the axis direction in natural helices , which introduces an intrinsic uncertainty in the computation of the @xmath25 angles ( see methods for a detailed explanation of how the axis is reconstructed in the typical case of a non - ideal bent helix and for an estimation of such uncertainty @xmath26 ) . a relaxation of condition @xmath3 is thus crucial , if we want to analyse correctly data extracted from the database of real native protein structures",
    ".    we will show in this paper , by means of partly semi - analytical geometrical arguments and eventually numerical simulations , that such threshold effect does drastically change the random reference distribution .",
    "having measured helix - helix packing angles from a set of @xmath27 proteins representative of the pdb native structures , we will then reanalyse the packing angle distribution after its proper rescaling with the newly found reference distribution .",
    "we employed the same ensemble of 600 proteins considered by chang et .",
    "al @xcite , which consisted of sequences varying in length from 44 to 1017 , with low sequence homology and covering many different three - dimensional folds according to the structural classification of proteins ( scop ) scheme @xcite .",
    "the structures were monomeric and determined using x - ray crystallography .",
    "we collected @xmath28 helices each with at least four consecutive residues classified as helical in the pdb files .",
    "the average number of residues of these helices was @xmath29 .",
    "two helices were defined to be in close contact , if at least one interhelical contact between @xmath30 atoms was present , with a maximal threshold distance of @xmath31 ( analogous to condition @xmath2 in the text ) .",
    "only helix pairs separated in sequence by at least @xmath32 intervening residues were considered , to get rid of possible correlations induced by short loops .",
    "the resulting data set consisted of @xmath33 closely packed helix pairs .      the reconstruction of the helix axis from the coordinates of the @xmath30 atoms of the corresponding residues is a critical step in the determination of packing angle preferences . since real helices can be bent , we adopted the procedure described by walther _",
    "@xcite , in which a local axis is associated to every consecutive residue pair along the helix .",
    "the overall axis is thus a broken line consisting of short segments .    a good starting approximation for the local axis @xmath34 , based on the the four @xmath30 atom positions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , was introduced by chothia _",
    "we employed a sligthly modified definition , where we first define the normalized bond vectors @xmath39 . in this way ,",
    "the set of three orthonormal vectors @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , the natural reference system associated with the @xmath30 atom trace , can be defined without the distortions due to the fluctuations of the bond length between consecutive @xmath30 atoms in the following way @xcite : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .",
    "if the @xmath30 atom trace followed a perfect ideal helix , the vector @xmath46 would be parallel to the helix axis .",
    "we then initially determined the local axis between residues @xmath47 , @xmath48 , as the vector parallel to @xmath34 , of length @xmath49 , which has the geometric centre of the closest four consecutive @xmath30 atom positions , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , as its midpoint .",
    "the two local axes at the helix termini were obtained by simply prolonging the neighbouring ones .",
    "we then applied a smoothing procedure similarly to walther _",
    "the ` new ' local axes @xmath34 were obtained by averaging the direction of the closest three ` old ' ones , @xmath50 , @xmath34 , @xmath51 , while conserving its midpoints . for the two local axes at the helix termini we averaged over the direction of the closest two available ones . to ensure the continuity of the overall axis ,",
    "the inner hinges of the broken axial line were computed as the midpoints between extremities of consecutive local vectors obtained from the running average . after repeating the whole procedure twice ,",
    "the standard deviation of the distances of each @xmath30 atom from the reconstructed helix axis was @xmath52 .",
    "the interaxial packing angle between two helices was computed bewteen the local axis pair for which the minimum distance of closest approach was achieved . in case",
    "the segment of closest approach ( sca ) intersected an inner hinge of the broken global axis , the local axis direction was defined as the average of the two corresponding local vectors .",
    "the whole discussion concerning the perpendicularity of both local axis direction with the sca applies only to cases involving a terminal local axis , since face - to - face packing is anyway ensured in case of contact between inner local axes .",
    "packing angles are positive if the background helix is rotated clockwise with respect to the frontal helix when facing them .",
    "the angle @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) corresponds to parallel ( antiparallel ) helices with respect to their sequence direction .    imposing the further requirement that the sca intersected both local axis directions at a perpendicular angle within a threshold @xmath22 plays a critical role , as discussed in the text .",
    "for the three different @xmath22 values considered in this work , @xmath55 , we collected datasets of @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 closely packed helix pairs , respectively .    as a final remark we report the mean value of the angle @xmath59 which is formed between consecutive local directions averaged over all inner hinges of all helical axes which were reconstructed using the procedure discussed above .",
    "we found @xmath60 , strongly supporting the necessity of allowing a similar threshold when imposing angular constraints as in condition @xmath3 .",
    "we will now sketch the geometrical consequences of relaxing condition @xmath3 within a given threshold , in order to understand by means of a simple argument how this effects the random reference distribution .",
    "a comprehensive analytical treatment is in principle feasible but quite cumbersome .",
    "numerical simulation will ultimately be the preferential approach to extract the corrected random reference distribution for interaxial angles .    within the admitted threshold @xmath22 , cases similar to the one described in fig .",
    "1b may now occur .",
    "the sca between the two helices , which intersects helix 1 at one of its axis ends and helix 2 at some internal point , forms an angle @xmath20 which deviates from @xmath61 by less than @xmath22 , whereas the gsca does not intersect both helices ( in this situation @xmath62 ) . if @xmath63 , the two helices are considered to be in contact .",
    "the condition @xmath64 is equivalent to the condition that gsca intersects helix 1 within a distance @xmath65 from the end of its axis .",
    "this limit is reached when @xmath66 .",
    "there are also cases in which @xmath67 and @xmath68 , when the sca intersects helix 2 at one of its axis ends and helix 1 at some internal point , and cases in which both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are not zero , and the sca intersects both helices at one of their axes ends ( fig .",
    "in this last case , the geometrical condition implied by @xmath69 , and involving the distances @xmath70 , @xmath71 from the end of both helix axes to their intersection with the gsca , is more complicated ( and is discussed in the caption of fig .",
    "1 ) .    using the visual representation of fig .",
    "2b , we can say that allowing condition @xmath3 to be satisfied within the threshold @xmath72 , opens up the possibility for the starting point of helix 2 to lie in the portion of space ( @xmath73 ) formed by the four lightly shaded parallelograms ( two parallel to helix 1 with sides @xmath74 and @xmath75 , and two parallel to helix 2 with sides @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) and by the four remaining white corner regions ( whose boundaries are defined by hyperboles , see figure 2 caption for details ) , which surround parallelogram @xmath9 .    to compute the area of @xmath73 is not trivial , because of the hyperbole - shaped regions , but the result is obviously @xmath8 dependent .",
    "for example a simple trigonometric calculation shows that :    @xmath78    this implies that the area of @xmath73 diverges for @xmath79 , which already points towards the fact that relevant corrections are possible even for small values of @xmath22 .    to conclude our analysis we need to enforce also condition @xmath2 . by using the pythagorean theorem",
    "it is easy to see that for any fixed @xmath80 , @xmath2 is satisfied for any point ( thought as starting point of helix 2 ) whose distance @xmath81 from parallelogram @xmath9 is less than @xmath82 .",
    "these points belong to the region @xmath83 , shown in fig .",
    "2c , formed by the 4 parallelograms ( two of sides @xmath74 and @xmath84 and two of sides @xmath76 and @xmath84 ) and the four circular sectors ( of radius @xmath84 ) surrounding a. the area of @xmath85 is independent on @xmath8 ( see caption of fig . 2c ) .",
    "all the points in the portion of space @xmath86 resulting from the intersection of @xmath73 and @xmath87 satisfy both condition @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the probability @xmath88 of selecting a particular angle @xmath8 with a tolerance @xmath22 , at a given distance @xmath63 , is given by the product of the spherical polar term @xmath89 @xcite and a term proportional to the area of parallelogram @xmath9 _ plus _ the area of @xmath90 .",
    "when @xmath91 , eq.2 shows that @xmath77 diverges and thus : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the area of the corner regions in @xmath90 .    since @xmath84 does not depend on @xmath8 , the second term in the bracket will eventually dominate the small @xmath94 behaviour of @xmath88 . in practice , the actual relevance of this effect can be appreciated only after integrating @xmath95 over @xmath5 , since the relative weights of the different terms in the bracket vary with @xmath5 .",
    "such computation is quite cumbersome and we have rather chosen to get @xmath96 by simulating random helices which satisfy the contact conditions within a threshold @xmath22 , and to extract numerically the normalized histograms .      in order to compute the reference distribution @xmath97 for interaxial packing angles we generated _ random _ helix pairs by means of computer simulations , and then selected them with the same conditions , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , used in extracting histograms from real helices in native protein structures .",
    "note that when computing the reference distribution we did not take steric effects into account ; in other words random helices might overlap .    more specifically , we constructed ideal discretized helices with the same geometrical properties of @xmath98-helices in real proteins , i.e. twist per residue @xmath99 , rise per residue @xmath49 , radius @xmath100 ( as is the case when considering @xmath4 atoms ) .",
    "we chose to generate helices consisting of @xmath101 residues , the average length in the dataset of real helices that we collected from the pdb . keeping fixed the position of the first helix",
    ", the second helix was placed by firstly choosing randomly the midpoint of its axis within a sphere of radius @xmath102 centred in the midpoint of the first helix axis , and then selecting , again randomly , both the direction of its axis and the twist of its first residue .",
    "boundary effects might be relevant , when the radius of the sphere in which the second helix is generated is too small with respect to the helix length and helix finiteness is effectively reduced .",
    "we made sure that our results did not change when increasing the radius of the sphere in which the second helix axis is placed .",
    "we generated @xmath103 random helix pairs , @xmath104 out of which satisfied condition @xmath2 of having at least one pair of residues distant less then @xmath31 .",
    "condition @xmath3 was then applied , in the same way as explained in methods for the real helices data set , with the whole axis being now a segment in the ideal case . in this way we generated @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 helix pairs , respectively , for the three different @xmath22 values considered in this work , @xmath108 .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the corresponding random reference distributions @xmath97 , comparing them with the ideal ( @xmath109 ) case : @xmath110 .",
    "the difference , although due to a very subtle effect is substantial , and it is clearly seen that a new regime is present for @xmath111 , as expected from the previous discussion .      to test the effect of this new reference distribution we have recomputed an experimental distribution of interaxial angles ( see methods for details ) by analysing a databank of 600 proteins and using a contact threshold @xmath112 and a tolerance @xmath113 , corresponding the intrinsic uncertainty @xmath114 estimated when determining local axis directions ( see methods ) .",
    "the histogram is reported in the upper panel of fig .",
    "4 : in order to obtain good statistics for each single bin , we gathered results every @xmath115 . the histogram is consistent with previous analysis @xcite . in the middle panel of fig .",
    "4 we plot @xmath116 and , for reference , @xmath6 normalized with the same binning as in the previous panel . finally , in the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 we present the histogram both rescaled with @xmath116 and with @xmath6 .",
    "the results are clear and striking : the correct distribution @xmath116 removes the spurious peaks at @xmath14 and @xmath117 , whereas @xmath118 out of the @xmath119 predicted packing angles @xcite arise as clean local maxima in the expected positions",
    ". only two of the predicted packing angles are clearly not favoured according to our analysis . remarkably , the two peaks theoretically predicted at @xmath120 and @xmath121 , that were seen as shoulders in the unrescaled histogram , are instead placed in the correct position ( within binning uncertainty ) in the rescaled histogram .",
    "we also note that a residual preference for parallel and antiparallel alignment of two contacting helices can not be ruled out even after proper rescaling .",
    "because of small statistics , it is difficult to ascertain whether this is a genuine effect or is just due to the tail superposition of different preferential angle peaks . in order to further test both the robustness of the results and the full procedure we have obtained statistical histograms from the experimental data using three different thresholds , @xmath22 . since we can compare them with the corresponding random distribution we should expect three similar rescaled histograms .",
    "this is nicely confirmed by fig .",
    "5 , where the three rescaled histograms show a very good overlap , within the statistical uncertainty .",
    "we also note that generally , the greater the threshold used to relax condition @xmath3 , the more blurred the peaks corresponding to the sterically preferred angles .",
    "this confirms that condition @xmath3 is needed to ensure face - to - face packing and the applicability of steric models .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the calculation of the probability distribution of interaxial angles between random finite helices which are in contact is not a trivial geometric problem , because of the approximations introduced to ensure face - to - face packing between contacting helices .",
    "such approximations are unavoidable , due to the imperfect shape of natural occurring helices which do not have well defined axes . although analytical results can be found to estimate the correct random distribution , the simplest way to obtain it consists in using numerical simulations .",
    "we have presented a re - analysis of the distribution of packing angles rescaled with our new reference distribution and we have found a remarkable agreement with the packing angles predicted by steric models @xcite .    99    crick , f.h.c .",
