    "the main motivation of using the hamiltonian is that it contains all relevant degrees of freedom of _ confined _ and _ strongly _ interacting matter .",
    "it implicitly includes the interactions that result in the formation of _ new _ resonances .",

    "therefore , it is widely conjectured that such deconfined matter would not be produced , especially in @xmath1 collisions at low energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the degrees of baryon number transport likely affects the overall dynamical evolution of the system .",

    "the spatial and time evolution of the system is too short to assure initial conditions required in order to derive the parton matter into deconfined qgp .",
    "we notice that @xmath9 ratios up to rhic energy are smaller than unity indicating an overall excess of @xmath45 over @xmath46 .",
    "this would also imply that a certain fraction of the baryon number is likely transported from the incident projectile at beam rapidity to mid - rapidity region of the system .",

    "the ratios from the heavy - ion collisions @xcite are very well reproduced by hrg model . in both types of collisions",
    ", there is a dramatic increase in the @xmath9 ratio .",
    "for instance , in rhic heavy - ion collisions , the ratio is @xmath47 ( @xmath48gev ) , which is obviously much higher than the ones measured at sps ( @xmath49 at @xmath50gev ) @xcite and ags ( @xmath51 at @xmath52gev ) @xcite",
    ". also in the @xmath1 collisions , the @xmath9 ratios obviously increase from na49 over isr and @xmath53gev - rhic to alice .",

    "[ fig:1a ] gives the fitting according to regge model , which reasonably describe the @xmath9 data from different @xmath1 collisions .",
    "this fitting is elaborated in ref .",
    "the baryon pair production is assumed to be governed by pomeron exchange and baryon transport by string - junction exchange @xcite .",
    "therefore , it has been concluded that alice results seem to be consistent with the baryon number transport .",
    "the solid line gives the results from hrg model , section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "no fitting has been utilized . over the whole range of @xmath0 , the two parameters @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath8 remain constant , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively .",
    "it seems to be a kind of a universal curve .",
    "it describes very well the heavy - ion results .",
    "also alice @xmath1 results are reproduced by means of hrg model .",
    "so far , it can be concluded that the future heavy - ion program of alice likely will produce @xmath9 ratios similar , when not entirely identical , to the ones measured in this current @xmath1 program .",
    "secondly , the ratios run very close to unity implying almost vanishing matter - antimatter asymmetry",
    ". some astrophysical consequences of these results will shortly be elaborated below . on the other hand , it can also be concluded that the thermal models including hrg seem to be able to perfectly describe the hadronization at very large energies and the condition deriving the chemical freezeout at the final state of hadronization , the constant degrees of freedom or @xmath60 , seems to be valid at all center - of - mass - energies raging from ags to lhc .",

    "it is obvious that the resulting @xmath67 will be extraordinarily large indicating dominant radiation against all other equations of state in this era where matter and antimatter are supposed to be almost symmetric .",
    "the matter - antimatter asymmetry is one of the greatest mysteries in modern physics .",
    "the well - known sakharov s conditions @xcite ; baryon number violation and c and cp violation besides out - of - equilibrium processes ; are conjectured to give a solid framework to explain why should matter become dominant against antimatter with the universe cooling - down of expansion . recently , a fourth condition has been suggested ; @xmath68-@xmath69 violation , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 being baryon and lepton quantum number , respectively . in standard model , both @xmath68 and @xmath69 are not conserved , explicitly .",
